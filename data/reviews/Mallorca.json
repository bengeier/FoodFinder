{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here on my birthday for a special dinner during restaurant week. We got the calamari and sausage appetizers, which were great. The bread and salads were also good. For dinner, we both got the paella.  The paella was very dissappointing, especially for being a signature dish, because it lacked key flavors like saffron. There was also excess water at the bottom of the dish. Ive made significantly better paella at home. The leftovers tasted better becuase the lemon that they placed on top for serving was then infused in the dish and gave it better flavor.  Then to top if off, my boyfriend had asked the waiter (while I was gone from the table) to surprise me with a candle on my dessert for my birthday, but they forgot. Overall, I am mostly dissappointed with their paella, so I'll have to make it at home next time instead."}
{"text":"The food was very good. I had an appetizer which I unfortunately do not remember as, if I recall correctly, it was a daily special. For my meal, I had the prawns wrapped with bacon. Delicious. The prawns were huge, the bacon had a delicious flavor and the brandy sauce complimented the dish perfectly.  I also ordered a Sangria, which was quite tasty, although it was a bit heavy on the ice, which left the final sips tasting quite watered down.  Now as far as service: many of the other reviews mention the elegant feel that the waiters, dressed in tuxes) bring to the restaurant. It's true and this is definitely somewhere I'd enjoy having a romantic meal. Unfortunately, based on Yelp's information, we made the mistake of going in jeans and t-shirts and were completely out of place. So much so that we almost left; Nicely, they said we should stay, yet our waiter seemed a bit snobbish as a result. Other tables were *noticeably* being waited on more often, they never offered us a drink or dessert menu and were quite slow to bring the check.  I'd still go back, but based on how good the food was, this could have been easily a 4 star. With Yelp, though, the way you treat the less then ideal customers matters, so I'm sticking with A-OK for now."}
{"text":"Haven't been to Mallorca in over a year but from the looks of some of the posts I doubt much has changed since my last cpl visits. The first time I went I had the gazpacho- decent enough I guess, and the twin lobster tails- extremely bland with a cap. 'B'.  \"Saffron rice\" very bland indeed. I've had way more flavorful Spanish rice at my local Tex-Mex restaurant. Add to this the curious 'house' potatoes- mere kettle chips-- that's right folks, potato chips billed as house potatoes. Next time I went had the Sopa de Ajo, not bad at all. The tapas selection might be the best thing on the menu next to the Portuguese almond liqueur they serve gratis @ the end of the meal. Tried the paella on the second visit as well. The seafood was rather mediocre, and all atop the same bland saffron rice. No spice whatsoever like you would expect from a restaurant that purportedly specializes in true Iberian cuisine. The wine list is altogether pricey; however the house sangria was tasty. All in all, with tip, expect to pay out an arm and a leg at this place. Definitely not worth a return trip in my mind, but to each their own. Add to this the horrendous parking situation (but then this is downtown Cleveland, after all) and the experience isn't any more memorable. The decor probably is in desperate need of updating but if you like shabby-chic then it's right up your alley- but this is the least important aspect about this place in my opinion. If you enjoy paying out the wazoo for mediocre, bland attempts at true Spanish food then this establishment is made just for you."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant after the Cavs Championship Parade because we were able to make an immediate reservation.  Upon entering, an employee impatiently greeted us and told us that they were closed-- at 6pm. We then said that we had booked a reservation on Open Table and he still refused service until we complained that they should have taken the reservation times off Open Table.  From there on out, we received AWFUL service. We had to ask for napkins and silverware multiple times and waited around until our server found it convenient enough to take our orders.  When the salad came, our server practically flung the plates onto our table and when our entrees came, he practically barked the dish name at us for us to claim it because he didn't remember who had which entree.  The server never came back to check on us and we waited some more after we finished eating to ask him for the check.  As we waited for our check, we saw that he had sat a party of 4 people next to us, even though they were \"closing\" when we walked in. He noticed that we were all staring in disbelief and he actually said to us, \"Because they are Spanish.\" He proceeded to treat them with exceptional service, reciting the daily specials, drinks, etc.  So... because they are Spanish and we weren't, we received crap service?  I am Asian and I have never seen that level of prejudice in my entire life.  As we were walking out, we also noticed 3 other tables in the front of the restaurant with patrons looking at their menus.  Apparently this restaurant likes to pick and choose who to serve and who not to serve. The owners should be ashamed of themselves."}
{"text":"This place is so over the top.  It's the furthest thing from fine dining, which makes its prices hard to swallow.  I wouldn't have gone there except I got a gift certificate.  Even so, my gift certificate wouldn't have made a dent in the cost of dinner, so I opted to pop in one Saturday for lunch.  The service is ridiculous.  Waiters all dressed up in black-tie garb and they overemphasize probably-affected accents and speak at insane bellowing volumes.  With the tables as close together as they are, it just made me feel like everyone in the room had to be involved in my ordering process.  And there are all sorts of unnecessary flourishes in taking orders and presenting the food.  Now, I'm not saying the servers weren't nice.  They were.  And it's probably not their fault that they're all costumed and eccentric; I suspect that's part of the gig.  But it doesn't come off like a fine dining establishment.  It seemed like a farce.  Likewise, the food is ridiculous.  The one thing I can say about the high prices is that at least you get your money's worth in quantity.  I mean, the amount of food served to one person bordered on obscene.  I had the gazpacho, which was salty but otherwise bland.  Then I went with paella, as it seemed to be the house specialty.  Goodlawd what a mountain of food!  And that doesn't count the entire plate of veggies that come with it (green beans, broccoli, cauliflower) and the plate of potato chips (\"spanish style fried potatoes\" my a**) and the plate of plain white bread with butter in little plastic packets with foil peel-off lids.  Nothing served had spices or flavor, just S&P and oil.  Way too much salt in everything, I was chugging water for the next 24 hours.  Then, uninterested in all the generic desserts offered, I opted for some kind of sorbet, maybe grapefruit.  When the waiter returned, he informed me they only had coconut (of all the sorbet flavors he had offered me).  I insisted that I didn't want it, because I don't like coconut, but again, I'm not really sure the entire room full of patrons needed to be privy to that conversation.  In the end, I took the majority of the paella and the veggies home.  I wasn't about to eat them, but it seemed wasteful to throw them out, so I pawned them off on someone with a lesser palate.  The server was quite gracious in sending me home with lots of broccoli and cauliflower, which he noticed I had eaten all of, and just left the green beans.  Unnecessary, but kind.  I feel really bad hating, because the service was awfully well-intentioned.  But the whole experience was just way too in your face and low-quality.  I truly don't know who considers this place worth patronizing."}
{"text":"Excellent!  It was a date night for my wife and I as the kids were at camp and we were looking for something nice and different.  Mallorca was a perfect choice.  The food was excellent and as other reviewers have mentioned, all entrees comes with salad, rice, potatoes, and vegetables.  I had the paella which was huge (had to take half home).  My wife had the special bone-in blue cheese encrusted fillet.  It was fantastic.   The servers set the mood.  They are very attentive, keep your glass full, and can be entertaining (the guy telling you about the specials is really into his job).  I highly recommend the house made sangria.  Something different to make the night special.  I can get a gin and tonic anywhere.  Save room for the deserts.   They didn't disappoint.! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Drove into Cleveland late on labor day and found that Mallorca was one of the only places still open. We were famished and walked in 6 minutes before the kitchen closed. While the initial person tending to us was a little grumpy we rapidly felt welcomed by our waiter, Victor,  who made the rest of our late night dining experience a real pleasure.   We each ordered a paella dish, one vegetarian and the other a seafood medley. The food was excellent with generous helpings that were well worth the money.   Would definitely go back there if we find our way back in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and it is a very good place. The waiters treat you nicely and the food is great. You also get a variety of side dishes when you order an entree."}
{"text":"Excellent experience provided by the staff.  The paella valenciana was spot on perfectly seasoned moist and with lots of seafood, chicken and sausage.  The sangria was not spectacular but good and strong enough.  Desserts were fresh and delicious and the Spanish coffee (cafe Mallorca) with liquor was made table side with fire and all.  Great experience overall. The wait staff was very attentive and engaged in conversation often.  Great find in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Thought this place was EXCELLENT!!  Ate here with a friend in the midst of our cross-country road trip. We were looking for a good sit-down relaxing meal and this really fit the bill.  The Spanish-style food was excellent and the portions were huge! I had the stuffed salmon special of the day which was so good, I'd totally have it again. We also tried the calamari appetizer which was worth it.  My friend got the sangria, which she said was good and strong.  The wait staff was very attentive to everything without being annoying. They removed a plate as soon as it was empty and refilled glasses promptly.  At the end of the meal we were given a small glass of Portuguese almond liqueur compliments of the bar. It was excellent!"}
{"text":"I've been to Mallorca restaurant three times in the past few years.  I've never been disappointed.  The food, and the service were excellent and the portions were enough for lunch the next day.  My wife had the Sea Bass and I had the Stuffed Salmon.  My wife stated that her Sea Bass was incredible and cooked just right . My Salmon also cooked perfect.  Yes, we would again to Mallorca."}
{"text":"This place really sucks, they just gave up doing anything. And you may get cockroach in your meal as a dessert good luck"}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service...  Plenty of exotic menu options to choose from."}
{"text":"Mallorca is one of my favorite restaurants in Cleveland. I've eaten here over 20 times and am not sure if I've ever had something I didn't like. The best entree here is the rabbit. It is not on the menu so you may have to ask for it. Just like everything else here the portions are huge. A close second is the \"shrimp in a garlic sauce\". There are a lot of shrimp and the flavor is unbelievable. All of their fish dishes are great with some of the best being the grouper, mahi-mahi, and stuffed orange roughy. All meals come with rice, vegetables, and homemade chips. The only knock I have on Mallorca is the price. If possible it is better to go at lunch as you get the same menu and portion sizes at less than half the price. I'm not saying it's not worth the price at dinner because as I mentioned it is a lot of food but I just have trouble paying that much more for dinner than lunch for the same food.  I would absolutely recommend Mallorca to anyone."}
{"text":"I found the cockroach in my meal and also very bad service! The server acted very impolite. The worst restaurant ever for me"}
{"text":"I would Give it a five but  nobody gets a five. That is reserved for perfection. The staff were prompt and friendly all 10 of the specials were offered, including the one I got and it was good food. I may go back even though I seldom eat at the same place twice."}
{"text":"I had a really nice time at this place. When I went we ended up with a rabbit dish that wasn't on the menu, it was just something that the chef makes for the employees. I don't remember how we were able to order that, but it was so good. I am a big fan of game meats when they are done well. Anyway, our server was charming and did a fine job. I would definitely go back. As for the house potato chips, order a glass (or bottle) of cava to drink with them, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"The tuna ceviche was excellent. The lobsters were cooked perfectly. Get the Atrium Spanish wine, it's light, not too much tannin, and a little sweet to the palate. It has a classy dining atmosphere and the servers were friendly and attentive. They brought out two shots of Spanish imported liquor for us at the end, free of charge. So delightful!"}
{"text":"We had reservations to celebrate our son's birthday. We do not live in Cleveland and our son had heard about the restaurant and wanted to go. My wife & I read positive reviews for this restaurant, so were excited for something unique.  We arrived for our dinner early, and they seated immediately, which was surprising.  One of the staff came to the table, and without introducing himself, just started rattling off the evening specials. When he left the table, all 4 of us looked at each other puzzled that we might have caught maybe a few of the specials, but missed most of what he said. He also was looking all around as he was speaking. Very impersonal.  Another person came for our drink order. The first person came back and we wanted to order an appetizer and enjoy our cocktails. The waiter wanted our entree order at that time.  By this point I was feeling a a little rushed,  the restaurants website talked about a relaxed  dining experience.   We had a very hard time carrying on a conversation due to the loudness of the room. RIght after the appetizer was delivered, they brought the house salads.  The appetizers that we ordered were edible, but nothing exciting.  The salad was generic & boring and was drenched in a house dressing which tasted like thousand island dressing. A bus boy stopped by the table and asked if I was done, and I said no, and then reached over and took my plate. Once again, we were getting the feeling they just want to turn tables. The entrees arrived. I had ordered the paella, my wife the Chilean Sea Bass, our son ordered the goat special and his girlfriend the stuffed chicken breast.   Now we did not ask them how their meals were, but for what I paid for our meals, this was just average. The paella was just ok, and I was really disappointed as I hadn't had paella for many years.  My wife said her Sea Bass was overcooked and rubbery, and had a tasteless sauce underneath it. I again read through some reviews and we can't believe that the occasional person would rate this as excellent. This was far from authentic. Bland vegetables arrived with our entrees. The place was loud, cramped, service was rushed, and the food was way over priced for the quality.  I look forward to good dining experiences, and this certainly was not one of them. Mallorca will not be on a second try list."}
{"text":"We went here on a recommendation - one that was bolstered when our cabbie said it was the best restaurant in the world - and we all loved it even with the high expectations.  I went out on a limb and tried a bite of blood sausage, and I was surprise at how good it was.  Nice consistency, not too irony.  The grilled octopus appetizer was also done well.  Not too chewy, and full of flavor.  The last app we tried I htink was off the tapas menu, filet tips and shrimp - hard to mess up, but they delivered.  For entrees, I was torn between baby goat with a Cabernet sauce and pork osso bucco (both from an impressive list of 5-6 specials). The server recommended the goat, and I'm glad she did. Best goat I've ever had. It fell apart with just the fork, was bursting with flavor, but was not greasy.  There were also whipped parsnips on the side that were creamy and delicious, and went well with the cab sauce.  I tried the paella as well, and it was fantastic.  Far superior to that which I tried at Jaleo in the DC area.  Not fishy tasting, just fresh and full of saffron.  A third member of our group got a specials which was fish stuffed with crab, shrimp, and mascarpone - it was delectable, too, but I think I would still take the goat and paella before it.  All-in-all a standout meal."}
{"text":"I went to Mallorca for an anniversary lunch with my girlfriend on January 1st. Let me paint you a picture.  We walk in to the restaurant in time for our reservation after parking at the adjacent lot. As soon as we enter, we are robustly greeted by the maitr d', an older gentleman. As the websites states, the staff is wearing tuxedos, but all of the staff members are wearing rumpled, dirty clothes with stains on them. The first thing I noticed was that the Christmas decor is up and there are Christmas tunes playing in the main dining room.   The appetizer and food we chose were as disappointing as the atmosphere and the decor. I would not consider a return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Went to Mallorca last night to celebrate a friend's birthday. The staff was very attentive but a little too quick taking the plates away. The salad had a fabulous dressing. I had one of the specials, salmon stuffed with crabmeat and it was superb. It was perfectly cooked and the stuffing was fantastic. My friends had the lobster ravioli, veal scallopini and a chicken dish that was a breast stuffed with spinach and mozzarella cheese. Everyone enjoyed their entrees. The sangria was excellent though a tad bit pricey. The sides were a bit disappointing with just rice and a veggie medley a little on the crisp side. Moved to the bar later and had a mango martini....dellicious!"}
{"text":"Here in the US, any mention of a Spanish restaurant, you'd probably think tapas.  That was my thinking when my local friends told me we were having lunch at Mallorca.  So it was a pleasant surprise when we saw the menu, and realized that they are a regular restaurant.  Of course, we had to switch gears from having a few tapas, to full on lunch.  And at Mallorca, it is full on.  I started with the Sopa de Ajo as a reminder of my childhood.  It is slightly different from what I'm familiar with.  The broth was much thicker than a richly flavored consommé.  The egg, instead of cracking a raw one into the soup, was poached.  On a cool, windy day, it worked.  Next up, our table shared the Chorizo ala Plancha, and Stuffed Mushrooms with Marscapone.  The sausage were on the dry side, perhaps not enough fat to cook it as-is.  Side story.  A Latino friend in my party loved the flavor of the sausage so much, the restaurant agreed to sell some in bulk.  At the end of our meal, one of the waiters presented the wrapped package, and mentioned that to serve, just slice the sausage, and put it on the griddle quickly without any oil.  After the appetizers, we were brought plates of house salad.  An entrée here comes with salad, saffron rice, veggies, and Spanish potatoes.  My entrée was the Tilapia stuffed with shrimp, scallop, and crab in a lemon butter sauce.  The portions here are HUGE.  My fish was basically 2 pieces of fillet, with the stuffing sandwiched in the middle.  For the 4 of us, they brought out huge platters of rice, steamed veggies, and potato chips.  There were so much food going around.  Why 3 stars?  If you crave a simple family restaurant, but also want something more ethnic, Mallorca is the place."}
{"text":"Mallorca was pretty good. I wouldn't call it authentic Spanish cuisine, but their paella was good. I tried the dirty pickle martini and it was tasty. I would try it again and get a different dish."}
{"text":"It is rare that we go to a restaurant with the ambience of Mallorca and afterwards long for a Wendy's hamburger. I know it sound sacrilegious! We sampled such items as the mussels in hot sauce, calamari, veal, and paella. If you've been to Madrid you know good paella. But this was awful! All were scared of the mussels as they exuded an unusual odor and tart taste.   Interestingly, upon seating we were excited! The head waiter was full of charisma, sporting that Mediterranean enthusiasm causing our entire party to eagerly await what we were sure would be an experience. But as fate would have it 'teas not the experience we all anticipated. We were at the table for 3 hours, often requiring us to flag down our waiter (similar to hailing a NYC taxi at 4:30 pm on a weekday) to inquire about the whereabouts of our food. We were greeted by indifference.   The food scene has improved to such an extent in Cleveland that there is no reason to ever eat here. I'm sorry to write such a bad review, but the experience for the 4 of us was simply inexcusable!"}
{"text":"Mallorca is my favorite restaurant in Cleveland. Not only is the food wonderful, it's the experience.  Enrique is passionate about his service and to hear him recite the daily specials is amazing in itself. We come here for special occasions and are never disappointed. Thank you!"}
{"text":"The food is really really tasty. But the service especially after you are done, is least to desire. It's felt that they just want to get rid of you. And I thought this was just one time but sadly it happened a few times that I was there. I will go back again and again for the food and will just eat and go and deal less with their service."}
{"text":"Truly my favorite restaurant.  The Cabrito is cooked to perfection and the paella is amazing!"}
{"text":"We have gone to Mallorca regularly over the past 15-20 years and have observed a noticeable decline in service and food quality. Our party ordered surf and turf, T-bone, shrimp in bacon and another shrimp dish. The shrimp dishes were fine and well prepared but the lobster was dry and both steaks were under-seasoned and bland. The T-bone came cooked to well done instead of the requested medium. After our entrees were served no one came to check and ask how things were prepared so we had no opportunity to return them or ask for something else. Once the initial drink orders were filled no one returned to ask if we would like refills. Fortunately the water was refilled regularly.  The service was very, very slow. It took well over 30 minutes for our entrees to arrive. Fortunately we allowed two hours for dinner prior to our concert so we weren't late, but we did not have enough time to order dessert because it took so very long for the server to return to our table.  The senior service staff has appeared brusque, rushed and occasionally rude on our past two visits. They're usually fine tableside, but if you are walking to the restroom and encounter a service staff member in the hall or doorway they will charge through, almost running into you. This has happened to me more than once. Which makes sense if they're understaffed.  There are enough fine dining choices downtown not to be stuck at Mallorca. It was good while it lasted, but we'll be looking for someplace else next time we dine downtown. I give it two stars only because of good times and meals there in the past."}
{"text":"I have dined at Mallorca twice, 14 years apart, and both experiences were very enjoyable.  The food was excellent and the service was outstanding.  I must say that the first outing exceeded expectations due to the fact that peach wine was served after dinner  - compliments of the house.  After discussing this to the manager, he promptly provided my dinner party with complimentary wine at the end of our dinner.\\  The little things to go above and beyond keep customers loyal.    I would highly recommend a trip here - it is worth your time."}
{"text":"Such a sad experience, borderline epic fail. Waited for 20+ minutes for our drink order to even be taken, no specials offered til asked....terribly overcooked twin lobster tails that could have been bounced back to sea. No offer for dessert and we were here to celebrate a birthday add insult to injury with a 17 minute wait for the check...so wanted to love and support an age old Cleveland staple but I just can't. DON'T BOTHER."}
{"text":"Great service and selection of food!  The servers and waiters worked very hard to please us.  Cristo was excellent!  My only complaint was that my friends steak wasn't cooked right the first time.  Cristo took care of it and promptly took it and got him another one.  I appreciate the willingness of the staff to try to make us happy."}
{"text":"This popular place gets a lot of good reviews...I just can't second them for my own experience...They do seem to try to make it an experience...for us, ok, but not great.   High energy/noise level...more so  from the hyped-up waiters than  from excited diners.    Service was just ok...seated promptly at our reservation time, but with no wine menu...maybe we looked too baptist..but had to get up and go ask for the wine menu. Decent house salad..mine came with a half slice of tomato too.  Come on, for a three-figure meal, you gotta serve at least the whole slice of tomato.  But the house dressing is excellent.  Salad served before our appetizer...we would have preferred it the other way.   Fried Calamari was good, as well as our entrees of veal  and the Chilean Sea Bass special...Tiramisu was very good as well.  But overall, nothing really knocks your socks off here while,  for the prices, you would expect more.   But it is an experience, and the Spanish/Portuguese menu is different.   Lots of folks use it for special occasions.  For me a little better than average, but to say very good is a bit of a stretch for my experience.  For an expensive night out, there's better choices...But if you're really craving Paella and Spanish cooking, it's good, just not outstanding/great."}
{"text":"I took a friend here for her birthday last night; it was our first time here. The place was fantastic. Our waiters were excellent. The food was very good. I had the stuffed salmon, while she had the Chilean sea bass, we were pleased with our orders. True the house fries/ chips are just kettle chips but other than that it was a fantastic experience. They sang happy birthday to her and brought a complimentary slice of chocolate cake. I will definitely be coming back here again."}
{"text":"Had  very enjoyable experience at Mallorca !  I agree whole heartedly with the other reviews - homestyle Spanish/Portuguese preparations in homestyle portions.  We ordered the mariscada (shellfish casserole) with fra diavolo sauce (not on menu, our servers suggestion), which was an enormous portion of shellfish (shrimp, scallops, mussels, clams, even lobster) in a red sauce with the perfect amount of spicy kick.   We also ordered an appetizer, stuffed ocotpus, which was three octopi stuffed with shrimp, crab and marscapone cheese, and sopa de ajo (which was excellent).  Servers are gracious, attentive, and numerous.  We had at least four different people stop by our table.  Plus, after a minor accident (bus person dropped plates, spattering sauce all over my S.O.) a server rushed forward, with soda water.  To our surprise, he offered us numerous free items, dessert, even offered to call the manager, which in our mind was all completely unnecessary.  Their prompt and courteous response was all that was called for and was something I haven't experienced at many restaurants."}
{"text":"I've been to Mallorca a few times and always had excellent food and service, but this last time left a lot to be desired.  I had a reservation and we were seated promptly. We then sat around for awhile before someone finally took our drink order and brought out some bread. They took our order for an appetizer and that came out quickly. We finished and our main courses came out soon after that. Unfortunately, nobody bothered to clear our appetizer plates and we were forced to shove them and stack them to the side while we ate our main course along with the other side dishes that came with the meal.  It was only after we finished that they cleared the table. After that, we sat around waiting for another 5-10 minutes before a waitress (not our original server) came by and asked if we had been offered dessert.   At this point, I was pretty disappointed with the level of service and so we got our check and left. All in all, not the normal level of service I have received in the past from Mallorca. This was a weeknight and the place was not packed so I'm not sure what the reason for the poor performance was."}
{"text":"We came here for my sisters 29th birthday and it was absolutely amazing! Carlos and Enrique, our servers were very attentive and very fun and interactive. The seafood was fresh and delicious. Great portions for a great price! They sang happy birthday with a complimentary piece of chocolate fudge cake for the birthday girl. And when you think it can't get any better, they brought us a free round of shots! I would highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"This was such a disappointment! The service was so slow and you couldn't always understand the wait staff. When you asked them to repeat what they said, you now had it repeated to you with an attitude. The food didn't have much flavor. We had the stuffed mushrooms as an appetizer and it tasted like a blob of white bread was stuck in the middle. I had the broiled pork chops and they were so overcooked you could hardly cut them with a meat knife let alone chew them. The \"Spanish potatoes\" are nothing more than kettle chips. The rice had no flavor what so ever. The wine selections are quite pricey. I will say that the dressing on the salad was tasty and the after dinner shot was probably the tastiest thing we had. We were extremely disappointed and felt like we should have just taken a match to the stack of money this cost us."}
{"text":"Amazing time at Mallorca!  Excellent from the time we entered until we left.  The food selection was great.  Lots of specials. The staff was very well versed on menu and wine list.  I had paella which is one of my favorites and they outdid themselves.  Large portions.  Friendly staff.  Will always return when I am near."}
{"text":"OMG! What a great place. The food is great I have tried several of the dishes here. All are served with the rice, veggies and potato chips. I love the fried calamari the best I've ever tasted.. The waiters are top notched all know the menu like the backs of their hands. Every time we have gone we are always given a complimentary shot of almond liqueur. A great finish to a fabulous meal."}
{"text":"Mallorca  is a rare example of superb food , fresh and perfectly prepared, and a great value. For a few bucks more than a whopper value meal I got a seafood stuffed salmon that was huge, beautifully prepared and presented, and so fresh and tasty that I thought about coming back for dinner to get it again.   The fresh salad included has this Spanish french dressing that makes me lick my chops in my dreams. The meals come with fresh potato chips , beautiful Spanish rice, and fresh veggies with garlic. And they refill the sides if you are hyper drive.   I have been coming here for 2 decades and this place never ever disappoints. There are never less than 10 specials and I salivate as the incredibly competent staff reviews them for us. How do they memorize these daily?    I love the lazy relaxed dine and chat atmosphere. The staff is at my beck and call at all moments.  This is old school fine dining without the snoot.   By the way, for an incredible experience seek the stuffed whale sized lobster tail stuffed with seafood. Not cheap but worth every dime.    There is a seafood medley in a green garlic sauce that is sublime.  To start try the finest calamari app that I have ever had in ohio. Try the Irish coffee made tableside in a fun little dog and pny show. Kina like a baked Alaska dance with flame and flailing pouring into brandy snifters.   Keep in mind I am an expert eater and have eaten in some the finest places in the country. I don't think I know better than anyone else but I do know when things are REALLY GOOD.  Try it for lunch first. If you're disappointed then you're out only the cost of a commissary prepared meal like those at a Fridays or perkins. My bill for lunch was $27.00 with a 20% tip, AND I BOUGHT MY GUEST'S LUNCH!!! We did both just drink water with lemon though (not bc I am cheap but bc I have sworn off soda and I can't drink on this diet)  That's $14.00 per head for a lunch that would have nicked me at least $15 more at most places this good.  I was here with another couple, and they had the same dishes we did plus an appetizer and they each had wine. Their bill was only $42.   CLEVELAND BEST VALUE PERIOD.  Is it too soon to go back? I don't want to seem like a stalker......Cheers! And Good Eats To All!!!!. DK."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Mallorca for the first time last night. I was a bit disappointed in the food.  It wasn't bad but it wasn't really all that great.  Drinks: We each had a glass of wine - the wine was excellent and the pours were quite generous.  We made the mistake of sitting outside (it was such a nice evening), but there were a ton of little gnats that kept trying to get to the wine.  Appetizer: We started off with the calamari, which was okay.  There were big and small pieces, the small pieces were overcooked and chewy.  The bigger pieces were cooked perfectly, however had a slight fishy taste.    Dinner: I had the fillet of sole stuffed with salmon and spinach (enough to serve 2 people), it was cooked perfectly, but again had a slight fishy taste to it.  It also came with sides of salad, rice, vegetables and chips, all of which were good.  My boyfriend had the paella (big enough to serve 3 to 4 people).  All of the shellfish was overcooked, but the chicken and sausage were really great tasting.  To me the rice was too salty, however he really like it.  After dinner they gave us an after dinner drink (not sure what it was, but very sweet).  Overall, the service was great, the food was okay, the drinks were the best part of the meal and as for the prices, some may say it is pricey which it kind of is, except when you see the portions of food they serve, it is well worth the price.    I am not sure I would go back here, since there are so many other great restaurants in Cleveland."}
{"text":"It all starts with the service. Our server treated us as if we were his only customer. Took plenty of time to go over specials and explain the entrees. I highly recommend the stuffed salmon. The others at the table had the goat, Chilean Sea Bass and pork medallions. Great choices and not a bad dish on the table. $208 for 4 people with 2 appetizers and 2 drinks apiece."}
{"text":"We did a large annual Christmas dinner with our family and they did a fantastic job! Food, drink and service was excellent!  I really enjoyed the Sangria along with the Paella.  Everyone else really enjoyed their meals.  Each person ordered specific entrees and then they come around with the sides family style (vegetables, rice, etc.).  I think this likely will become part of the tradition!"}
{"text":"Bad Food!  Paella was prepped and prepared ahead of time and not made to order as waiter stated. Seafood, chicken tough...Paella's saffro rice was dry and tasteless.  Carrot cake dessert dry and disappointing."}
{"text":"Sad to say that I have been coming here many years and this is my first review. This is an old school fine dining restaurant. White table cloth, servers in bow ties, fancy but I think affordable for what you receive.   As I said old school fine dining, no fancy fusion dishes etc. but  just some great Spanish, American dishes, lamb, goat, rabbit, tons of seafood dishes, thick steaks etc...  Nice menu , but wait for waiter to explain their long list of specials they have everyday.   My favorite is their octopus ,BEST I have had anywhere period !!   Service is old school also, Outstanding ! Drink a little water, refilled immediately ect...   If you really want to splurge try their 24oz. Stuffed lobster tails. Yes 24oz. Tails ! Unbelievable!!   This visit we tried the (of coarse) octopus appetizer, and calamari. Then the stuffed shrimp and scallops in their green sauce (garlic,parsley,olive oil)   All TOP Notch !!!!   FYI: all dishes include a salad with house dressing, yellow rice, steamed veggies and home made chips.   Mohorca's is great for a date night, business meeting or a fun night out with friends.  Give it a try , you should enjoy some of the old school fine dining !!!!"}
{"text":"Enrique is the absolute best waiter!! He is what makes your experience at this restaurant fantastic! Make sure to ask for him!  With that being said the food varies on flavor depending on what you order. We were here in a party of 8 and some of us got wonderful meals while others were left a bit disappointed. The meals that were lacking were the Jumbo Shrimp stuffed with shrimp and marscapone- the flavor was good but the shrimp were a little over cooked. The special Mahi Mahi was cooked wonderfully but the sauce had absolutely no flavor and was extremely bland. The really good dishes of the night were the Rack of Lamb (a special) and the Veal Scallopini in a White Cream Sauce (we used the bread to soak up the leftover sauce). I wish the meals were more consistent because we had such a fun experience with our almond liquor shots after the meal and our fantastic waiter."}
{"text":"In sum: Bad service, bland food.  When we got here, we were directed to wait for our reserved table at the bar. Not a problem. We were kind of early anyways. Upon sitting at the bar, my date decided he didn't want anything to drink, but I was thinking of ordering something. The bartender decided for me when he ignored us for 10 minutes. We finally just got waters when we were about to be seated. So we get to our table...  We're excited! The menu looks delicious! BAM! Our waiter is behind me, yelling, and grabbing my shoulder simultaneously. Immediate reaction: Ok, this guy is a little nuts, but entertaining. But then it got old quickly. I'm not a fan of being brutally accosted by waitstaff, let alone touched by them. He continued to yell throughout the evening, whether it was to us or other tables. He slurred his words, he was yelling so hard and trying to speak so fast. I'll refer to him as our \"yeller\" from now on, instead of \"server\", since he did more yelling than serving.   Ordering time! Ok, so I was settled on an appetizer, but still had a few options for my main course lined up in my head. I figured, we'd get the app order in and have some time to decide. Nope. Our yeller demanded we order everything at once so there wasn't a long wait for anything because \"this place is crazy tonight.\" Ok, fine. Ordered, done.  As we waited, we started grow hungrier and hungrier. Our little plate of chips was long gone. Relief!! Our appetizer finally came and it was pretty good. Nothing extravagant. Mussels in green sauce: two of my favorite things. I gobbled mine up. But, after awhile, we wanted some bread with the delicious sauce. Nope. We waited and waited and waited and got the bread shortly before our entrees. This doesn't make sense to me. So we start to eat. My entree was not good. Stuffed tilapia sounds great, but in execution, it was probably the worst piece of fish I've ever gotten at a restaurant. It was overcooked to the point of crispiness, with that weird chewy texture that overcooked fish gets. The stuffing was good, but way too rich alone. Not worth it at all. The rice side dish was good, but rice is rice. Kind of hard to mess that up. I ate way more of that food than I should have for it being so boring and not very good at all. But, I was hungry. Can't take it back now.  As we finished, our dishes were cleared and we were ignored for a substantial amount of time before being hounded for a dessert order. Absolutely not. So, our yeller said he'd bring the hazelnut liqueur and our check and we can head out. He completely disappeared. We couldn't hear or see him. FINALLY, someone else showed up with our check and we anxiously awaited the return so we can get out. As soon as possible, we book for the door. But not before our yeller plows over me and yells something indecipherable.   It was a pretty bad experience. Between the horrible service and the not so great food, I know we'll never be back."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Had steamed octopus, shrimp/crab stuffed salmon. spinach/brie chicken and roasted baby goat. Our server was Cristo who took absolutely great care of us! This place is a hidden gem for a date night with your loved one. I am definitely a loyal customer now."}
{"text":"dined for moms bday with the family..Great atmosphere great food.. Service was okay and we asked for more bread for the table and our server said we ate too much bread..Thought our server was joking but he was serious..smh."}
{"text":"The food was good, don't get me wrong, but the best part of the experience by far was our waiter. We went for lunch and he delivered the list of specials with an extra large serving of gusto. I don't think I would have liked this place quite as much if the waiter hadn't been such a character.    The paella was very good, as was the Tilapia (lunch special), but the portions felt more like dinner portions. They could stand to scale back a bit  -- who wants fish in a doggie bag, anyway?   The oddest thing for me was that we were served a basket a potato chips with our meal. Maybe I have the wrong impression about Spanish cuisine, but I didn't think potato chips factored into the equation.   Overall -- good food, fantastic service, slightly pricey, pretty tired decor, and huge portions."}
{"text":"Overall: Great quantity of food for the price, but food quality and service is average.  I would probably eat here more often if I lived closer, but I won't be returning given that I live in Akron; I usually look for a place to wow me if I'm going to make a special trip up to Cleveland.  Food: The entrees came with bread, salad, boiled veggies, and potato chips.  The sides were what I might expect from Olive Garden: bland and with little seasoning. But, they were all decent portion sizes.    The main entrees themselves were above average, but suffered from some technical flaws.  The paella was very well seasoned, but some elements were severely overcooked (langoustine was tough and sinewy), the clams were sandy, and about half of the shrimp were not properly deveined (even though someone had slit their backs, poop shoots were still intact!).  We had no issues with the chicken breasts: it was moist and the stuffing was delicious.  Service:  Service was attentive but a bit overbearing at times. Our waiter stood pressed up against the table and loomed over us so that we had to crane our necks up to speak to him.  He also cleared away plates and sides without asking if we were finished, and continually topped off me and my partner's sangria glass even though I hadn't exactly planned on drinking 1/2 of the pitcher.  At the end of the meal, they were gracious though to bring us both complimentary almond liquer.  Atmosphere:  Cozy, but a little empty for a Saturday night."}
{"text":"I had heard great things but I was sadly disappointed. The decor was a bit dated and noticeably dusty. The service was solid. However I noticed some complimentary drinks seemed to appear on my bill at the end of the night. The food was pretty good but not good enough to make me return especially considering the alternatives."}
{"text":"The meal was a delight.  The service was good with a skill that checked but was unobtrusive. I had the cabrito special that was on offer tonight and found it tender and very delicious.  All in all a lovely meal with enthusiastic staff.  I recommend this place and will visit again they next time I am in town."}
{"text":"What's up?   Went in with 4 middle aged  couples.  We sat at the bar, the birthday girl among us wanted a Spanish coffee.  We waited 10 minutes for the barmaid to take our drink order.  4 of the 8 ordered the Spanish coffee and were given empty glasses and were told it would be a couple minutes because she could not light them on fire and would have to wait for a server (?).   Well it only took her 3 tries to make my Beefeaters rocks and by then another 20 minutes elapsed.  Still no Spanish coffees.  Lol.. We called the barmaid over again, she told us they were to busy now to make those kind of drinks..  Ahahahaha, its their specialty.  Oh by the way they also couldn't change the channel on the TV to football game.  Not saying they wouldn't , they \" couldn't \" sheesh.  Guess I'm glad we didn't do anything really complicated like order a meal.  We left and to another place.. Our sad birthday girl will have to wait another year."}
{"text":"Had a fabulous pre birthday dinner here on July 11th ! Everyone's food was prepared to perfection. I had grilled salmon, my husband had beef short ribs, our friends had the T bone and grilled salmon . Everything was great as were the appetizers and side dishes ! The home made sangria was terrific and I highly recommend it. As usual the service was impeccable."}
{"text":"I was greeted and sat immediately by bartender (female, tall, short hair blonde), who was very friendly.  Ordered the mussels fra diavolo and baby goat special. The mussels were cooked fine, the sauce was a bit disappointing, quite salty (and I love savory) with very little heat. The goat main  came in a dark brownish sauce that was a bit unappetizing (dark brown on brown meat), could have used some colorful garnish to spruce up the appearance. Main came with a generous helping of chips, rice and lightly sauteed veges.  Overall, the service was prompt and courteous (four stars). The food was adequate, but a bit pricey for the quality (three stars)."}
{"text":"Tried while traveling in Cleveland for work and after reading reviews on Yelp. Great atmosphere, service and the food was amazing! Got the scallop special for an appetizer and Sole fish for dinner - AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Mallorca is a seafood lover's Paradise, with an extensive menu stuffed full of upscale seafood fare.  Portions here are legendary, so bring an appetite and expect to leave with a full stomach and a size-able take-out container.  Entrees come with a sizable salad, rice, steamed vegetables, Spanish chips along with the actual entree.  I would suggest holding off on any appetizers, as the amount of food you get is more than enough as is and the entrees are a much better value for the money.  The appetizer portions are much more reasonable and priced relatively higher for what you get.  As far as the food goes, it has never been disappointing in my experience.  I've yet to try any of the non-seafood fare, but the seafood is consistently excellent, cooked perfectly and delicious.  As other reviewers have noted, the wait staff can come off as overbearing and somewhat discombobulated, which is why I'm not giving Mallorca 5 stars."}
{"text":"Thank you for such a great time/dinner last night.  I had the special,  goat stew, which was AMAZING.  It was tender and full of flavor along with the steak y camaron en ajo.  My husband's bone in rib eye, melted bleu cheese, and shiitake mushrooms was indescribable.  We really enjoyed ourselves.  I didn't get catch our wonderful server's name but he described every dish with such passion and enthusiasm.  Thank you again!"}
{"text":"I was in town on a business trip, and I noticed that there was a Portuguese restaurant in town. There's a good one in northern New Jersey (El Cid's) that I've gone to several times, so I figured I would try this one out. I felt like I had been teleported back east because this was the spitting image of their East Coast brethren. I had the paella, which I am NOT joking, came in a tray....and this was a serving for one person...Seriously, it's sitting in my hotel refrigerator right now, and I have no idea what to do with it.  I lament about this because the paella was terrific. They had sauteed red peppers mixed with yellow rice, peas, pork, and tons of shrimp, baby clams, and mussels. It was terrific, but then came with a salad, a loaf of bread, and steamed vegetables. It was really good, but honestly, this will last a week. I felt like a glutton walking out with this massive tray of paella, but oh well, that's my problem.  My advice to the passing traveler; check it out, but be warned, their portions are enormous, and two can dine for the price of one."}
{"text":"I am honestly extremely surprised by the praise that this restaurant has received. I was completely underwhelmed by every aspect of this place, from the decor, to the food, the service, the PRICE, etc.  We will not be back. I gave it 2 stars because everything was clean/edible, but that's basically it.   To start, we had reservations and had to wait at the bar for a table, not a huge deal, but then when they took us to our table it was practically in the aisle between the bar area and the kitchen. Why they would even put a table right there, I have no idea. I requested that we move slightly over to a different 2-top that was open, which we were able to do - thankfully. Shortly afterwards our waiter came over and hand to god - only spoke to my boyfriend. He directed his eye contact only to him, only directed questions to him, etc. It wasn't chivalrous, it was bizzare. Other than that the service was \"fine\".   On to the food - My boyfriend order the filet and I ordered the tilapia with shrimp/crab - both entrees were good, but for the price, not worth it. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind throwing down on an awesome meal, but this was no where near awesome.   The worst part were the side dishes:  Salad - iceberg lettuce, a few shaved carrots, a tomato slice, dusting of some house dressing - basically generic   House potatoes - KETTLE CHIPS!! Yes, a $$$ restaurant's \"house potatoes\" are potato chips!! Unbelievable. Its like serving Franzia as your \"house red\" (No disrespect to Franzia, I love me some boxed wine) I'm not sure how potato chips are \"Spanish\" either, but then again neither is iceberg lettuce..   Veggies - They looked like frozen Italian Blend I get at Giant Eagle and we were given 1 plate for the table to share - thanks for portion control??   Needless to say we didn't stick around for dessert, although they did give us a small glass of almond liquer at the end of the meal - which was nice a nice gesture, but didn't make up for the rest of the meal.   I asked my boyfriend to weigh in on my review and this is what he had to say:   \"Evidently, Cleveland thinks a Spanish restaurant is little more than Italian food served by Mexicans.\"   I couldn't agree more."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to check this out for restaurant week and we loved it! The service was some of the best I've ever had! The food was great! The only thing that didn't make it a 5 star was that they only had bottled beer (not draught)."}
{"text":"Simply put, if you're going to spend this much on dinner, go to Greenhouse Tavern. The service was great, but the host made some rude remarks when I had to run in at the beginning to make change for my cab ride there. It is clear they focus on their service, and it was exceptional, but a bit overwhelming. The service and the mussels were the clear stars of the meal, but unfortunately they were the only stars of the night.   As for the meal,  got the surf and turf special a few weeks ago, and the seafood stuffed steak was good, but the lobster tail with it was absolutely underwhelming. Had to have been frozen before, had no flavor and was overcooked. Got a bunch of uncooked, freezer bag looking vegetables, don't know what they were for.   Bottom line, dinner and a glass of wine for two ran me $125. That price buys a much better meal in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Was in Cleveland for a wedding last weekend, and Mallorca was recommended to my in-laws as a \"good seafood restaurant.\"  They did have a good selection of seafood, but those of you who are allergic to shellfish may be disappointed that most seafood dishes come with clams or shrimp.    I had the blackened yellowfin tuna, which was served on a plate.  This sounds obvious, but really that's what it was - a tuna steak on a plate.  So, if you're expecting a grand presentation, you won't get it (unless you count the sliver of red pepper draped ever-so-gently over the tuna).  Sides are served family style.  The saffron rice was yummy, and the veggies tasted fresh but slightly too crunchy.  The \"Spanish style potatoes\" are basically kettle chips.  My main impression of this restaurant is that it was really happenin' in 1993.  I feel like it needs a Gordon Ramsay overhaul - not because the food was bad (it wasn't), but because the decor is a little dated, and the prices are WAY too high.    I will say that some of the other diners were eating some really good looking paella.  And our pre-dinner salads were quite good.  Even though the food was tasty (not mind-blowing), I was going to give the experience 2 stars, until the waiter popped up to give us all a shot of some sort of amaretto after-dinner liquor.  So, 3 stars it is."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant. I love the service and the ambiance. Even just hanging at the bar for the BEST EVER sangria you feel like a princess. I love the shrimp in white wine sauce or garlic sauce, their paella is great and so is the shell fish casserole in either the light tomato sauce or the garlic sauce is also excellent if you're looking for a variety of options (mussels, scallops, shrimp, 1/2 lobster, etc.). The meal comes with saffron rice, hand-made chips and steamed veggies. At the end of the meal you get a shot of amaretto."}
{"text":"Hi Yelp Community!! Todas we will review This Nice Mediterranean place. Let start by saying that this is a delicious place to come. It is very good for groups. The wine list is vast and good. Don't leave this place without testing the Paella dish is ridiculously good, I have tasted it In Spain and this one is far better. Have to come here."}
{"text":"We made reservations for a friend's birthday expecting this place to be tactfully great. After all, what Spanish food is not flavorful?! This was disappointing. The server was great. Offered us all specials and had a great description for each dish. Too bad the description didn't live up to the taste of the dishes. I ordered the chicken in garlic sauce because I love Spanish garlic infused dishes. When I got the dish it tasted nothing like garlic and the chicken tasted like it was cooked right from a frozen state. It didn't taste fresh. The Spanish rice was a let down as well. It tastes like those rice packages you put in the microwave from the grocery. Nothing about it was Spanish. The drinks (sangria) was delicious and one plate, the swordfish, was outstanding. Everyone else's dish was sub par. The family style sides were not good. The veggies were not steamed well and were almost raw (not good). What's with the potato chips?? What's Spanish or Portuguese about that? I will not go here again. Sorry! I will not recommend this restaurant to anyone. Almost as bad a Tomo Hibachi right down the street. Stay away!"}
{"text":"Not a fan. I've been here twice and found the food to be mediocre at best. The restaurant is nice, an eclectic ambiance and the service is good (not great).  But you feel like you're going to get This delicious authentic meal and I was just not impressed. I know a number of people who really like it but maybe they just have not had good Spanish food."}
{"text":"Know what to expect, and you'll be less likely to be disappointed.    Mallorca is a Spanish restaurant, not Mexican nor Italian.  It's home-style, not high-restaurant style.  Expect the flavours to be more homey, and the preparation less visually stunning, and you'll know a bit about what to expect.   Despite the choice in food styles, the presentation is interesting.  The servers wear tuxedos, but the decor is country estate.  It's formal, but not regal nor opulant.  It's like eating at the home of an uncle that wealthy back in the day, built a brilliant home, but it's a bit in disrepair.  The fabrics are nice, but a tad worn.  The food is tasty, however... and in home style portions:    We ordered a seafood paella, sauteed chorizo, calamari, lobster bisque, a beef roast and I had a glass of sangria.  It's all tasty and served in a gracious fashion.  We had a wonderful gentleman from Andalucia.  It brought the strains of the tune in my head- --  splendid accompaniment to a flavourful comfortable meal."}
{"text":"World class service and the food is worth the cost. I brought a friend and his lady friend there for lunch. Let's just say my friend is not always the proper attired type, and when reading the menu asked what a \" Fill it- Ming gone\" is. Somehow I was the only one laughing. The wonderful server kindly never missed a beat and treated him just like he was an aristocrat of some type. Although an aristocrat wearing sweat pants and a knit hat."}
{"text":"Great experience at Mallorca. The service was phenomenal; we were consistently checked up on my multiple servers throughout our meal with out being bothered too much. I had the lobster ravioli and my boyfriend enjoyed the rack of lamb. His meal would have fed 2-3 people - yeah leftovers!   A great meal, beautiful patio and nice ambiance. All in all, you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I just moved back to Cleveland after a few years away so I was excited to get back to some of my old favorites, Mallorca being one of them.  I was just so so so disappointed!  We all were!  The decor hasn't changed - it just got dingier and sadder.   As for the food - It has gone way down hill.  The drinks were watered down, overly sweet and under-liquored.  The food was just not good, like at all!  Our salads were drowning in dressing.  My husband's was a pasta covered in a bland sauce that tasted like it was from a jar.  I ordered what was supposed to be the special - tuna.  I wish I took a picture to capture how sad it looked coming out on a plate all by itself - horribly dry.  The sides were not near enough for our group of 4.   I will say, our server was great.  He was real friendly and helpful.  Their service failed though when I wrote a kind email to the management explaining our disappointment and I received no response.  I feel as though they have just given up.  Please save your $!  There are plenty of great options in Cleveland - Try Green House Tavern, Lola or Dantes."}
{"text":"Really great dining experience.  Was in town for business, and was really looking for something a little different, and this was exactly what I was looking for.  The food is unique, extremely well prepared, and priced reasonably for the quality and the quantity.  I dined at the bar, so of course, the service was great, but I'm assuming that the same can be said about the dining rooms as well.  Nice atmosphere, extremely nice people, good wine list, etc.  if you haven't tried this place, you should!"}
{"text":"Mallorca is the restaurant I used to frequent often before the Cle became a foodie paradise. It has actually turned into a Thanksgiving tradition. They cook a full course traditional thanksgiving meal that is delicious and saves me the mess and hassle.   The rest of the year I go to Mallorca for the Pollo Mallorca. Tender chicken breast stuffed with cheeses and peppers. So good. I also like the ever changing specials and once had a pork shank that was enormous and fall off the bone tender.  Meals are served with all sides \"family style.\" Mixed veggies, Spanish rice, and just made potato chips are served to the entire table. Each diner selects thier own entree.   The restaurant itself is white linen tablecloths somewhat fancy feeling. Waiters wear bow ties and are super efficient and fast talking. Extensive wine list, lots of beers, full bar, and pretty, damn good sangria if you're into that sort of thing (I am.) It's a pretty good place to bring a date or family. The food is Portuguese which is really just a selection of well prepared meats. Nothing is \"exotic\" but everything is tasty, so pretty much anyone can find something they like. There are a few vegetarian options, but it is mostly meat based choices.   There is a small area of sidewalk seating, too, so it makes for a nice vibe on summer nights."}
{"text":"Coming from a Spanish family, I had a lot of expectations when dining at Mallorca.  The menu was ok but not as authentic as I was expecting--no fabada which is one of my favorite dishes.  We started with the mussels in spicy sauce--it was ok--sauce was not spicy but had that spanish white wine red sauce taste which seemed promising.  For our entrees, we ordered a pork in Osso bucco style and stuffed trout.  The pork was cooked well, but the sauce was tasteless--a very bland tomato sauce which did not marry with the pork at all.  The trout was even worst--stuffed with a mayonaisse crab that tasted a few days old!  The trout was then drenched in a butter sauce that when combined with the mayo seemed just too much.  I had a lot of expectations and they weren't met even half way.  I would recommend against going to this restaurant there are a lot of other really great restaurants in Cleveland.."}
{"text":"Spanish and Portuguese.  This place is great.  The staff is always very formal and cordial.  This place can be cramped at times.  However, the food is great.  I enjoy seafood so I am pleased to find an assortment of fish.  I went with four people and we all enjoyed our food.  The food was fresh and tasty.  The portions were ample and not intimidating.  Living in NYC, I found the bill cheap.  If you are in Cleveland and in the mood for Iberian food, check this out."}
{"text":"Great service,  good food.  Sangria was good,  but I expected more.  We got stuffed mushrooms,  which were a must have,  stuffed lobster and stuffed chicken.  Everyone in the restaurant helped wait on us,  and we never had to pour our own drinks frim the pitcher of Sangria we ordered.  Huge portions,  you won't leave hungry.  Finished the night with a cannoli  inspired dessert; would choose one of the many other desserts next time.  They even brought us two free shots each at the end of the night!  Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about this restaurant!!  In Cleveland on business, I arrive on a Wednesday, when the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame is open until 9pm.  Famished, by the time I discover this place, its 9:30pm.  They greet me with a smile and I am seated at a comfy table in their darker, cozy dining room.  The service was OUTSTANDING.  The food, PHENOMENAL.  I ordered the stuffed shrimp.  It came with a really nice salad.  When they brought my dinner out (enough shrimp that I actually took 3 back to my room!), it is accompanied by 3 other dishes!:  saffron rice, steamed veggies & house made potato chips!  I thought for all the food you get, the warm atmosphere, amazing service, excellent wine by the glass list, and location, it was moderately priced.  I will definitely be going back again before I leave Cleveland and this time I am having the fabulous after dinner coffee which they make at your table with cinnamon in a snifter and different alcohol which they light on fire!  The cinnamon alight smelled incredible....until they set off the fire alarm, LOL, causing the firemen to actually show up to turn it off! LOL  Such a fun night for a woman travelling by herself!!  They even gave me a complementary shot of amaretto after dinner!   LOVE LOVE LOVE!"}
{"text":"Worst Service and food I have ever ordered.  What a disappointing Mother's Day as a result.  I never had such absoluely horrible service."}
{"text":"This restaurant has the potential to be a true gem in Cleveland. My family and I came  here on a Tuesday evening for dinner so the place wasn't crowded at all so we were sat right away. The ambiance was a little confusing so we can just say it's an eclectic kind of vibe. This place did feel a little dirty and I even had to ask my waiter for new silverware since some of the forks and spoons had residue on them. Sad to say I was disappointed by the food here.   We all ordered and decided to sample off each other. We ordered the lobster ravioli, the calamari, the pork chops, the penne pasta with pink vodka sauce and the filet of sole with muscles, clams and shrimp in a green sauce.(still confused why a spanish/Portuguese restaurant  has items you'd find in an Italian restaurant .)  the calamari was good, wish it would have come with marinara not hot sauce, the lobster ravioli lacked presentation, plain ravioli with a white sauce with no garnish. The pork chops were everyone's favorite, the penne was thrown out for tasting old and the filet of sole (tilapia) did not taste fresh at all. The rice and vegetables that come with the entree tasted frozen and reheated. One time here was enough for us."}
{"text":"What a delicious lunch!  The mahi mahi was fresh and cooked to perfection.  The saffron rice subtle and flavorful.  Lunch also included wonderful vegetables and homemade potato chips.  The portions were large and the prices reasonable."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of friends for a friend's birthday dinner. The food tasted great and fresh. We ordered a mussels/shrimp/scallop pasta dish, seafood paella, shrimp/fish/mussels in a green sauce; salmon, mahi mahi, and something else that I don't recall.   The salads were a great compliment for the palate for the 1st round. The dressing had a unique kick to it, something I never had and I liked it alot. Along with our dinners, it came with a side of a vegetable medley and spanish rice which is like sitting in a family style setting. All the food is passed around and everyone gets a taste of everyone's food. I ordered their \"Filet of Sole with Clams, Mussels & Shrimp in a Green Sauce\" and this dish tasted really good. The sauce wasn't too heavy and there's really not too much about the green sauce except peas! My other friends ordered the other entrees and the one that stood out the best was the paella. Over a bed of rice, it had mussels, clams, prawns, and if I recall scallops too. The mussels were bigger than my dish but overall, good.   The prices are a little higher but well worth it for a special occasion. The servers were attentive and all of them were men so that was a plus. They are well talented because I've seen all of them carry 7 plates on their shoulders without trays. The only downside is that I ordered one of their spanish white wines and it came out wrong so the second time around, supposedly its the one I ordered but it tasted just like a Reisling, so that was disappointing. But in the end, everyone got a shot of spanish liquor which had a sweet aftertaste to it so that was a great compliment to all the food we ate that night."}
{"text":"The food was good, but very greasy, and overdone with cheese. The service was fine, but the big kicker...their drinks are horrible. The first drink ordered was made poorly, and my second, was a martini that was made with well vodka instead of what I had ordered. Two young kids won't know the difference, right? Wrong. For the prices this place charges, and their inability to make a good drink, and average at best food, I can't see going back. I also couldn't recommend this place to anyone else."}
{"text":"This is my first visit in a long time to Mallorca.  We live closer to the location of it's former sister restaurant, Marbella, which has been closed for some time.  We used to frequent Marbella for dinner on a regular basis.  I work downtown, therefore when I worked closer to public square, my co-workers and I would visit Mallorca periodically.  My husband and I visited this past Saturday night, prior to a concert at Playhouse Square.  I had made a reservation through Open  Table, so our wait was minimal.  Also note, valet parking was $10.  I was a little disappointed with the host's appearance....jeans, polo shirt and sneakers.  Not what I'm used to at Mallorca.  We were seated in the far dining room, which was fine, lots of windows and natural light.  The dining room could use some sprucing up, but all in all, just as I remembered it.  We were immediately greeted with bread, request for our drink order etc.  I ordered Sangria, which is always yummy.  We ordered the shrimp in garlic sauce, as our appetizer.  Our salads and appetizer arrived a short time later.  The salad was nicely portioned, and properly dressed.  Lots of white onion, which I'm not a fan of, but easily removed.  The garlic shrimp was tasty, as well.  The shrimp were just a tad bit overcooked, but good.  Our entrees arrived, I ordered the fried shrimp and my husband ordered the pork chops.  The shrimp were jumbo, as promised, breaded nicely and still nice and hot.  My husband loved the pork chops in garlic sauce. He received 3 large chops, which were tender and seasoned well.  Of course, we received the requisite sides of rice, veggies and chips.  This was a very good meal, great value and excellent service.  We'll definitely return sooner rather than later."}
{"text":"I will start off by saying that I used to frequent this restaurant at least three times a week 8-10 years ago. Things change and a daily tab of this extent is no longer possible :)  Returning here this past week for the first time in years the host still knew me! Are you kidding me right now? Its been at LEAST 7 years.  Anyway we were seated promptly and shortly thereafter ordered.  We had an appetizer of garlic shrimp which was good but smaller in portion from what I recall.  We both had the same entree; 8oz Milet Medium.  The steaks were cooked to PERFECTION and tasted even better. No special sauces; no 'pick-me-up' Just the streak lightly salted with a dash of pepper.  the meat was heaven and highly recommended.   appetizer size really should return to normal. although admittedly we were both stuffed. Regardless here comes desert. I was far past my limit but I did have a couple bites. The Flan was out of this world.  To those establishments that claim homemade deserts, in particular things like Flan and Creme' Brulee I would recommend stopping in and having a taste. You will quickly see why people call you out on your 'homemade' . Mixing the packets don't count!  The Flan was fresh with rich flavor and perfect texture."}
{"text":"Decent place.  Confused by the Italian pasta dishes next to the tapas.  Garlic shrimp was good Calamari was great Paella was decent Chorizo was good Tiramisu was bad, dry  Service was pushy."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Mallorca last Saturday night after seeing the Christmas windows at the Higbee and gambling at the Horseshoe Casino.  What an amazing meal!  We ordered Temperanillo wine and oysters on the half shell as an appetizer.  The service was impeccable (numerous servers waited on us) and every one of them seemed happy to be there... in fact everyone in the restaurant seemed happy to be there!  My husband was impressed with the cleanliness of the restaurant (not a speck of dust anywhere) and the fact that the waitstaff appeared to know most of the diners that night.  I LOVED the art work and decor - the Picasso above our table was beautiful.  We ordered the specials of the night and shared them... Rabbit in a light gravy with potatoes and Baby Goat roasted in a dark gravy with roasted potatoes.  My husband thought it was the best meal he's ever eaten!  (He is a hunter and loves game dishes).  The goat was cooked like a deep, flavorful, tender pot roast and the rabbit was roasted tender like chicken.  We were starved but the portions were huge (enough for lunch this week)!  We finished with flan and a Spanish vanilla liquer (on the house).  Although we ordered a ton of food (saffron rice, house chips and steamed vegetables accompanied our meals) the price was relatively low.  We will be back soon to try other specials and enjoy the ambience."}
{"text":"Excellent service, always a great place to visit.  We enjoy spending time on the patio in the summer and because of the service have made this our go to place.  Thanks again for the great service and as always great food!"}
{"text":"Came on a dead Monday, which may have something to do with it.   Ordered the stuffed piquillo peppers, which tasted like they had been stuffed a week ago and warmed in the microwave.  Then had the paella, which better be the signature dish at any Spanish place.  Instead of the crispy socarrat (crispy rice) one is supposed to find at the bottom of the paella dish, it was a soggy mess.  The seafood tasted old and precooked, mussels were shriveled to the point of dessication, and it was inexplicably served alongside a bowl of unseasoned potato chips.  Maybe it's better on a busy weekend when they have to serve fresher food, I don't know.  With a bill for one of $50, I won't be back to find out.  Attentive service could also be attributed to the lack of business, but he was a good server and earned his place a second star."}
{"text":"BEST SERVICE EVER!  The fun in going to this place is having the extravagent servers prance and dote all over you...  My boyfriend was even thoroughly impressed by our Spanish server \"Enrique\"  I thought the food was fantastic, it felt very European to me.  I loved the twin lobster tails  My boyfriend loved his salmon The stuffed shrimp were also very good  Dessert was amazing After dinner almond liquor shots were provided complimentary at the end of the meal (but I'm allergic...booo)  So yes, go here.  It's pricey.  But I think its super fun and awesome."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Spanish restaurants ( and I have spent time in Spain)!!"}
{"text":"Had always wanted to try this restaurant...love true Spanish/Portuguese food. The good: * Decent atmosphere * Clams in greens sauce were decent, not amazing but, cooked nicely. * Sangria was very good. not too sweet The not so good: * The \"filet\" and shrimp tapas was awful. Tasted like very cheap quality meat and shrimp. Steak way overcooked too, very tough. After this, we did not even want to order anything else. * No octopus. How does this place not have octopus, especially after the waiter told me how great it was? The bad: * Two waiters arguing so loud by the bar (cussing each other) that the entire restaurant could hear. This went on for at least 60 seconds until someone told them to stop. * One of these waiters was ours and while he had a very outgoing personality, it was borderline aggressive and not a great experience.   Overall, not impressed, probably would not go back. I will definitely make the trek to Sangria Y Tapas in Westlake (I believe the owners used to work at Mallorca) for this cuisine in the future. They do it right and the are very friendly. We ended up going to Santorini (next door) for the rest of our meal and it was great!"}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant! I was in Cleveland for the weekend and decided to make reservations at Mallorca. Service was very prompt, the food was even better. I had the paella and I would highly recommend it to anyone. The house sangria was also very good. If I'm ever in Cleveland again I would go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"My dinner was delicious! A stuffed Salmon prepared perfectly. Have you ever been to a restaurant  and could not eat it all because the appetizers and salad were so delightful? Well I did and when I hot home, I was horrified to find that my Salmon (which I did not touch) was not in my container!!!!! Did they eat ir, drop it, or give it to someone else????  Never have I experienced this... not even in a dive! I called them back to inform the Mansger, left 2 messages and NOT ONE PERSON HAD THE DECENCY TO RETURN MY CALL!!!! $40 DINNER and all I had was some damn rice and veggies in my container! Don't ever send your food to be packaged in their kitchen. ..you will go home without it!"}
{"text":"Mallorca is a great date spot or fancy night out with friends spot. Our waiter was extremely friendly, even gave us a free after dinner shot. The salads and bread that come with the meal are really good and you definitely will not leave hungry. It's a bit pricier, which is the only reason I don't go more often.  I recommend the paella, surf and turf, and flan."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today with my husband, daughter and her friend. I ordered the paella, the girls ordered lobster ravioli, and my husband got the fillet and shrimp special. From the time we walked in until we left, we were treated like royalty. We never had to lift the sangria pitcher to refill our glasses, it was done for us. The portions were more than generous for the price, the food was phenomenal, and the service over the top. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Julie  Stopped for lunch and it doesn't seem like there's a difference between lunch and dinner menu's.  There's a wide variety of choices and a good handful of specialties for the day.  Started with Calamari and Chorizo's.  The calamari was light and and plentiful.  Chorizo was more like a aged ham sausage than the traditional chorizo that I am use to.    I went with a special of blackened yellowtail tuna.  Sides are provided in a family style manner with steamed veggies, yellow rice and deep fried chips.  I did the tuna medium rare and it was cooked more than I expected.  Still it was ok.  Nothing memorable.  It's a good value as lunch ran about $20...  Not sure I would return though.  This restaurant would get lost if in NYC or LA and prob not do too well.  In downtown Cleveland, It's not a bad selection and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"Great, authentic food and a fantastic wine list!"}
{"text":"It had been quite some time since I'd had a truly disappointing dining experience. It had been so long, in fact, that I had nearly forgotten what it was like. I can now thank Mallorca for refreshing my memory.  I get it, they're a Cleveland institution. They've been around forever. They're located in the storied Warehouse District of our fair city. The list of irrelevant qualifiers goes on and on. What I don't get is when a restaurant simply doesn't live up to their reputation and refuses to adapt with the times. Mallorca is stuck in 1990, painfully so. The decor is tired, even the dim lighting can't help it. Cheesy white tablecloths, bad wall sconces, black vests and bow ties, handwritten receipts like a diner? Ugh. This place is in desperate need of a makeover.  We had reservations for a Wednesday evening, 7pm. We walked in and had to awkwardly tango with a couple that was leaving because the entrance way is about as wide as a submarine corridor. The guy at the host stand was on the phone. He did not even look up to acknowledge that we had walked in. We stood there and waited for him to complete his call. I gave him my name and, without looking up, he grabs a couple of menus and leads us to our table. Sans greeting. Great start.  We dined in the side room and not the main dining area by the bar so it felt a bit disconnected from the restaurant. Adding to the ambiance was a couple, clearly drunk, loudly slinging insults and four-letter words at each other at the table behind us. Classy, folks. Luckily, the guy and his hip-boot wearing, Gucci bag toting companion left relatively soon after we arrived. Another thing, this place was damn loud. Loud enough that I had to constantly repeat myself during dinner conversation.   The service, alas, was the high point of the experience (and one of the two stars). While our water glasses were always refilled and our food delivery generally prompt and well-paced, the staff was, how shall I say this, a bit challenged. The energy of the place was frenetic. Servers dashing about, loudly talking with each other, a menu dropped, dirty linens hurriedly removed from tables...you get the picture. It just made me feel uneasy.   Adding insult to injury, every staff member that waited on us was difficult to understand (thick accents, broken English) and spoke very rapidly. The first server to approach our table rattled off what I think was a list of drink options, but I honestly couldn't tell. Whatever he said he seemed happy.  I won't belabor the point, but clear diction is key in the service industry and it was not in practice here.  The food was a disaster. I have had Spanish food in Spain and this, my friends, was a lifeless approximation. Woefully unseasoned, absurdly large portions with presentation devoid of attention to detail.   To begin, it's worth noting that all of their entrees come with a salad, a plate of potato chips (ridiculously labeled \"Spanish potatoes\"), and bowls of steamed veggies and white rice. IMHO the latter three should be eliminated completely and the salad, a boring mix of salad greens and thousand island dressing, should be completely reworked.  Calamares Fritos - Your typical fried squid appetizer. Average at best. To its credit, the rings (no tentacles here) were tender and very large, among the largest I've ever eaten. The breading, however, was very salty and the accompanying tomato sauce was watery. I also didn't get the pile of raw spinach topped with roasted red peppers. This would be the best dish of the meal aside from the table bread.  Paella Valenciana - This dish was an insult to paella. A bland mixture of overcooked shrimp, inedible mussels, chewy chicken and watery rice. Even the razor-thin pieces of sausage were devoid of spice. The few scallops I ate were pallid and grey and the split prawn gracing the top was like chewing unflavored gum. I've had fried rice from China King with more character.  Stuffed Filet of Sole - You'd think a place that prides itself on its seafood chops would nail a dish like stuffed sole. And you'd be wrong. My wife took three bites and that was the end of that. Again, bland, lifeless and boring. I'm pretty sure the crab meat was imitation and the sauce was watery and weak. Add to the mix rubbery, overcooked fish and this one had it all. I felt bad for the fish that wound up in this dish.  Consider this dead horse beaten. What was once (probably) a well-respected culinary destination is now limping along on its past - their website still boasts awards they won nearly 12 years ago! Anyone that rates this place more than three stars is clearly popping ecstasy. Mallorca is the model of a restaurant that has lost its way and, should Kitchen Nightmares and Gordon Ramsey ever come to town, a perfect casting option. I can only imagine what lurks behind the scenes. We will not be back."}
{"text":"This place is a Cleveland Classic. I had heard about it having an old school vibe and top notch service and I can confirm that both are true. Our servers were amazing - very professional with a good sense of humor. We had the octopus appetizer which was very good along with the Spanish National beer that was recommended. Both were excellent. I got the Lamb Shank special which was bold and flavorful. My wife went with the traditional seafood Playa that is the most popular dish that they have and we both enjoyed that enormously. I would highly recommend this place for date night, business meals, or if you are looking for something different."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is amazing.  I was invited out for a business dinner at Mallorca and wasn't sure what to expect.  We arrived and were seated quickly.  We had about 4 waiters/hosts/bussers attending to us at any given time.  Our wine/water glasses were never empty and there was never a moment where we felt like we were neglected.  Service was fantastic.  Yes, the wait staff has thick spanish accents, but hello, it's a spanish restaurant.  I'd be upset if they didn't actually speak spanish.  Plates are family style unless you order from the tapas menu.  We all shared a bunch of appetizers and they were all quite delicious.  The calamari was perfect and the garlic soup was fantastic.    For entrees we almost all ordered from the house specials.  When they tell you the specials, make sure to listen closely because they go by fast and they are not to be missed.  I ate goat for the first time and it was impressive!  The wine was amazing, with a fairly overwhelming list to choose from for someone who is not versed in wine.  Thankfully, we had someone at our table that was up to speed on spanish wines.    Dessert was fantastic as well.   They bring out a tray to show you what is available, plus a list of sorbets.  I ordered the sorbet and it was awesome.  Some others ordered from the tray and they were all very impressed.  If you enjoy spanish coffee, definitely order one!  Just the process of making the drink at your table is entertaining enough, let alone to taste of the drink itself.  I hope next time I'm in Cleveland and we have a business dinner we come here!"}
{"text":"Really more like a 3.5, but here are my impressions:  PLUSSES: extensive, reasonably priced wine list great atmosphere attentive servers unhurried but food all come out together as it should for our party of 10 lots of fresh fish specials healthy portion sizes fresh tasty bread and butter (chilled as I like) good appetizers - we enjoyed the calamari, HUGE scallops wrapped in bacon, and sauteed rock shrimp convenient location near stadium and other downtown sights parking right across street  NEGATIVES: No one in our party was \"wowwed\" by their entree choices; as others have said flavors were somewhat bland Desserts- again good selection but little drawing on the Spanish cuisine; tiramisu was respectable Lots of specials, but waiter not well served in the various preparations of such exotic things as baby goat and ostrich,  Prices fair but all entrees $20+  Enjoyed my experience overall and would certainly give it another try, venturing out to different menu choices"}
{"text":"I meet some colleagues here for work and was impressed. That about sums it up, not amazed but impressed.   I started at the bar and asked for an Old Fashioned. You can tell a lot about a bar by how they prepare an Old Fashioned. To say the least these guys did a great a job and I was given a free drink after my glass had a crack in it. Very considerate.   For my entree I had the Chilean see bass and it was really good. Perfectly cooked and full of flavor. I would definitely recommend it. I think it was a seasonal special but if it is on the menu, get it.  The desserts were fairly good and I opted for the flan. Not bad, and flan can definitely be done very poorly.   I would come here again and every had a great time. The service was pretty good for such a large group of us too. NIce job fellas!"}
{"text":"Woohoo-how I love you, Mallorca!    After an afternoon of bowling on E. 4th, my parents, brother and I walked a few blocks for some Spanish-Portuguese deliciousness.  Our waiter bellowed the specials with the rhythm of a flamenco singer, and we immediately went with a bottle of red.  I'll make the rest of this review short: the communal rice and vegetables were perfect, and my skillet of grilled shrimp (GAMBAS!) hit the spot.  My parents were similarly besotted.  In short, you won't be dissatisfied."}
{"text":"This may be the most disappointing dining experience I have had in a long, long time.  Had I been a little more concerned with the initial presentation we would have left before it started and avoided spending money on an inferior product.  Mallorca has never been Cleveland's finest but it could always be counted on to provide an elegant experience at a reasonable price complete with fine food and nice atmosphere. Well, one out of three ain't all bad.  The atmosphere is still as it was overlooking the flats and bridges to the west.  As the sun goes down the view is quite stunning.  The western exposure of the building is mostly windows allowing the edgy semi industrial flats to come in with the bridges all lit up.  An elegant experience it was not...  The servers still wore tuxedo's but for the most part they had seen better days a couple of years ago.  The service was rushed; almost forced.  When things were delivered to the table they were thrown down as opposed to placed quietly.  As the food started to come (in rapid fire) the servers didn't know who was having what.  Maybe it is a little picky but I expect the server in the iHop to ask who is having the pancakes, I expect the servers at Mallorca to have a process by which they know who is having what.  We ordered both salads and an appetizer to split.  The salads came out within 30 seconds of when we ordered them before the appetizers.  Appetizers should ALWAYS be served before the dinner salad and the diners should not have to deal with salads until they are completely done with the appetizer and the plate(s) removed.  The appetizer was plunked down on the corner of the table furthest from my wife and I before the salads were done.  I finished mine first and a server cleared my plate while my wife was still eating hers (another no-no).  The same happened with our main course dishes.  In past years one could count on Mallorca to have interesting Spanish dishes created with high quality ingredients.  Our appetizer of Manchego Cheese and Apples was disappointing, it was slices of processed Manchego and mealy apples.  The Baguette was burned to charcoal (so much so that I was surprised that the kitchen would release it, the manager would allow it to leave and the waiter would deliver it).  Butter for the bread was in plastic packets.  My wife had lamb that was tough and a little over done.  My veal was OK but nothing special. As you might expect, we chose to have dessert and coffee elsewhere.  This was more than a bad experience, it was sad.  Mallorca has been a place that could be counted on when entertaining out of town guests.  I don't see a return trip in our future."}
{"text":"I am in Cleveland for the next few months and a group of us go out each week to explre. tonight we tried Mallorca.  This is a wonderful Spanish restaurant in the Warehouse district.   We started with some tapas - the garlic shrimp was good and the sirloin tips were great.  I had the paella for my entree and I would highly recommend it you like shellfish. My dinner partners had the jumbo stuff shrimp was was very tasty as well and the stuff salmon which I did not try but looked wonderful. The house sangria was also very refreshing on this warm muggy, day.  There a big crowd for a Wednesday so service was a little slow but the staff was very nice overall."}
{"text":"It's a friends birthday so we decided to come to Mallorca.... Our server was extremely slow and unprofessional. It took Benjamin an hour and a half to get our order in. I probably won't be returning again."}
{"text":"Big disappointment - returned the first meal, second was no better.  Perhaps that's why the place was empty.  Skip this place!"}
{"text":"First of all, I hope that you get Enrique as your server. He definitely makes your experience at Mallorca that much more special. He is Spanish, with a thick accent that you can barely understand. Second of all, you must come hungry. They give you way more food than you can ever imagine eating. With each entrée, they give you salad, rice, vegetables and Spanish chips. Third of all, you must try their sangria. It's hands down the best sangria I've ever had. Other than these three things, it's up to you. The food is great. I had the mahi mahi with a lobster cream sauce, while others had salmon stuffed with crabmeat and mascarpone, baby goat with potoatoes (sounds scary, but it was some of the best meat I've tasted in a while), and baked chicken. There are options for every different type of protein and from what I tasted, they were all great."}
{"text":"I will never return a Lady friend and i decided to give this place a try on sunday 3/12/17 afternoon it took a long time to get our food after we ordered we ordered the stuffed shrimp entree with veggies & salad & we ordered a garlic shrimp appetizer the place was empty and it still took 30 min to get our food and when we got it everything was cold i don't know why it took so long it was only 2 other customers in the entire restaurant its unsafe to serve cold food my friend and i had upset stomach after eating this mess never again will i spend almost fifty bucks with tip for this crap"}
{"text":"Outstanding . Great service . Paella was amazing and tons of seafood in it . Sangria was very good.  Nice place to spend a special occasion ."}
{"text":"This is my first time going to Cleveland. I actually loved it. I chose Mallorca because it was Spanish influence. I have been to Spain and love the food. I ordered Mariscada en Salsa Verde. I loved it. It in fact reminded me of Spain.  I loved it so bad that when I went home I tried to replicate it. I think I did a good job of it.   But, the service was not the best.  It seemed to me like a fine dining restaurant and the waiters for the most had fine dining etiquette. But when i came in there was no hostess, and when I was seated the restaurant lacked that special attention.  I tried to talk to have a conversation with the waiters, servers, who ever was who there. but they just were very unfriendly.  I did notice that they had special attention to some other customers I honestly felt unwelcomed.   Mallorca I think you need to be more personal with your clients. I loved your food but I felt unwelcomed"}
{"text":"Maybe it was just what I ordered. But I expected a little more spice, or flavor, or something from this a Spanish restaurant. Or maybe something similar to what I had when I was actually in Spain. But not here. Food was a little bland and tasted like something my mom might make (meat/potatoes/veggies with little more than salt/pepper to season).   The atmosphere is nice, and it seems like an upscale restaurant but really missing that *something* to make it worth a second trip."}
{"text":"I tried the braised goat with madeira demi- glace. After I finished I returned to earth from gastronomic heaven. Defintely one of my favorite dishes in Cleveland"}
{"text":"Had a very good experience overall. Our main waiter, George, was wonderful. He was upbeat and had a real dramatic, presentational flair. He had all the specials memorized and did a great job of selling them -- we ordered several. He was cheerful, friendly, and attentive.  The food was wonderful. My party of 4 had the potato omelet, stuffed piquillo peppers, and  stuffed mushrooms to start. The portions were just right; big enough to satisfy, small enough not to overfill. Our main courses were the crab-stuffed tilapia, crab-stuffed shrimp, stuffed salmon special, and rabbit special. We were all satisfied. Portions were generous, and everything was cooked well. Great stuff. For dessert, we had flan and some cake. Dessert was fine, if nothing too special. The coffee was excellent.  There were some hiccups in service that keep this from being a 5 star review. While George was great, an assistant waiter took our drink orders and made some mistakes. 2 of 4 drinks were wrong (they were out of the beer that I ordered, but he didn't ask me if I wanted a different one, he just brought a different one and told me when I asked). These are not deal breakers by any means -- we'll be back!"}
{"text":"I am a food groupie. Trust me when I say I know food. However, I wouldn't touch this place with a ten foot pole ever again.  Waiters were rude, ambience was off, and it wasn't a place that you would stick around for dessert.  I was soooo excited to dine at Mallorca so I was very upset and caught off gaurd when my experience was everything but what I expected. Waiter came to our table very loud and obnoxious asking for our order... Didn't greet us... Didn't introduce himself.... NOTHING!!!!  I ordered a half pitcher of Sangria and the Lobster Ravioli for myself.  My Ravioli came out after about 40mins. and I thought that was a bit too long of a wait considering the place was nowhere near packed. It was very bland and it looked far from appealing. However, the taste was decent but I guarantee I could have found it in the frozen section of my grocery.  They bring vegetables, house fries (potato chips), and cold bread also. Veggies are definitely from a frozen and the chips have absolutely no flavor.  The Sangria gets an A+ from me which is surprising because im not even a drinker.  Top top off everything off... At the end of our meal the man says \"I know this is your first time here. Just to inform you, most people tip 20%.) Are you kidding me????  How rude!!! And the fact that I dressed up to go to this place off of reviews was bizarre. The hostess had on jeans and a casual shirt. The place was extremely loud to my surprise and the ambiance was off!  Bottom Line: I WONT BE BACK!!!!!  I'm surprised at all of the great reviews this place has recieved."}
{"text":"Mallorca is - an experience.  If you're looking for a quiet, romantic spot where you and your date can enjoy your meal in peace, this is not the place.  If you're looking for a restaurant where the sangria flows like water, the food is wonderful (and massive servings), your server is a part of your dining experience with you - whether they are singing in their native language or taking after dinner liquer shots with you table side - this is the place that makes you feel for a moment that you're oceans away from Cleveland.    Great place to go for celebrations of any sort - promises to be an evening you won't forget!"}
{"text":"This was the first stop for a Dishcrawl event in Downtown Cleveland. The staff was very friendly and quick to bring us drinks or remove our plates.   I have mixed feelings about the food. I had looked this place up online before hand and was really excited to try it out, but eh. They served us moist chicken breast stuffed with this creamy, cheesy, spinach wonderfulness inside, but paired it with two cold mediocre stuffed mushrooms and a scoop of Paella (shell fish casserole) which I thought did not have much flavor and the single scallop was chewy.   I would give this place a second shot, maybe I'd have better luck picking my own dish and if I wasn't in a large group. I just expected more flavor I suppose."}
{"text":"When I was a poor volunteer living in Cleveland, our house normally had a budget surplus.  I won't go into the arcana of Jesuit Volunteer Corps finances, both because it's pretty boring and because I don't remember the actual numbers--although I was the finance person for a few months--but mainly because our landlord was a saint, we paid very little rent.  Eventually, we would be forced to share our surplus with the Chicago house, which was bleeding money because they had lost a volunteer and because their apartment was way too pricey for a set of JVs.  (It was a really nice place, though, and I liked going there for parties, so I guess I didn't resent helping pay their rent as much as I let on to my roommates.)  Anyway, while we still had the surplus and with the knowledge that we would have to give some of it up, we decided as a community to splurge and drop like $200 or more (for the seven of us) at Mallorca.  I don't remember who chose the place or why I was so down for seafood, but it was a nice restaurant.  I didn't like the fact that I had to dress up or that there was basically nothing vegetarian (these were the days when I was a special-occasions pescetarian), but the paella was good, and the atmosphere was pretty classy, although very cold.  I think the service was good, but I just felt uncomfortable here.  It probably had a lot to do with how I was feeling about myself and my place in the world at the time, but it was an overall strange night.  I can't say I really enjoyed myself, although it was nice seeing my roommates enjoying themselves."}
{"text":"I went to Mallorca on a double date with my beau and parents to celebrate my birthday. I wish that I had chosen a different spot for the celebration. It was am okay meal, but it wasn't special. The steamed veggies were...well....minimally seasoned steamed boring veggies, the bread...boring white bread with packets of butter, and so went the rest of our meal.  The meals was about 3 weeks ago, and it was so unmemorable that I can't seem to recall the entrees.   Also, our table was right next the the kitchen and servers repeatedly bumped my boyfriend's chair the entire meal. Even after we scooted the table as much as we could, his chair still kept getting nailed."}
{"text":"Mallorca Restaurant is one of the worst, most overpriced restaurants in Cleveland. The food is bland and expensive, the service is laughable, and if you don't tip well enough, they will add more of a tip to your card without your permission."}
{"text":"Ok I don't know where to start I've been going to the place since I was a kid the food here is beyond great the butterflied stake is out standing the pork chop is great but the crem dela crem is the 24 oz lobster tail and the shrimp and rice FYI come hungry because the portions are very generous. The service is A-1 there is a reason this place stands the test of time and it's the food and service one of the absolute best restaurants in downtown Cleveland hands down."}
{"text":"We tried a couple of tapas which were fine, but we were impressed with the seafood casserole with saffron rice. And split it - it feeds about three people, honestly. Impeccable service, classy place."}
{"text":"The portions are large.  So if you're hungry you will not be disappointed.  The food was just okay but I liked the atmosphere and hospitality.  Even though I rated it a 3 star I would recommend Mallorca."}
{"text":"This place is very good. You have to know what to order. If you have had some authentic paella you may want to skip it. The seafood shines here. The portions will get you at least a lunch the next day. The service is great. They will prepare just about anything how you want it. The veal is very good. Must try the steamed octopus. Parking is a pain in the ass, but that is the w6th-w9th street thang if you know what I'm saying. (I hate paying for parking and water.) Last word of advise is not to drink that shot at the end of the meal unless you like cough syrup."}
{"text":"Amazing seafood! One of the best I've had. I am originally from Miami, FL where the seafood is just as good and this place is definitely up there!! The grilled octopus appetizer was so delicious. I had Chilean Sea Bass from their special. The service was superb, they really take care of you. All worth the money. Will come again when I am in town!!"}
{"text":"The first time I came here we were seated quickly, but after nobody came to get even our drink order after 25 minutes we left. I got it though, they were very busy and that just wasn't the right day for it. I went back a few weeks later and was really looking forward to some great Spanish food. The service was much better, and extremely attentive, but the food just really was not that good. We tried several dishes and while the portions were quite large (particularly the paella), the quality was poor. The food was clearly from frozen and quite bland, even the vegetables. The seafood was tough and rubbery and the soup overly salty.  While the environment was really nice and the wait staff clearly cared about the customers, my dining experience was pretty mediocre and I don't plan on going back."}
{"text":"Mallorca was such a disappointing experience for me. Especially when you consider the price point of the food, and the cheesy thickly accented waiters.   Let me first say that I went on a Thursday evening, and did not need a reservation. The decor is cute and makes you feel comfortable, but it looks worn and a bit run down.   The majority of the waiters are either unable to speak English, or speak it so poorly that the level of service they are able to provide is minimal at best. That was a huge problem for me. Secondly, the waiters that are able to speak English are very thickly accented and over the top. They bellow words out at you in an excited tone as though everything is magical new invention.   I found the majority of my food to be good, but nothing wowed me. I was especially disappointed in my main dish which was a mahi mahi in galic sauce. The fish was bland, and tasted as though it hadn't even been salted or peppered. As for the sauce, it was more like warmed garlic oil, and it was disgustingly thick. I sent it back almost instantly and ordered the bacon wrapped shrimp with brandy sauce. Served with mashed potatoes. It was much more flavorful, but again the dish lacked any real zest or flair that one would naturally expect from Spanish cuisine.   Several times during my meal I was interrupted by the bus boys who clear dishes away. They did this throughout the meal and OFTEN. I would say every 5 minutes or so there was someone at our table. More then once the one guy would come over and say \"excuse me\" in the middle of me taking a bite of food so that he could grab a plate on the other side of the table without walking around. I found that really rude, and it made me feel if I was being rushed through my meal. They also tried to take away the plate of rice and vegetable several times before I was even done with my food.   I ended up deciding to just take the majority of my food home instead of finishing it there. After desert and coffee I left,   I was very disappointed and will most likely never go back. I have several friends who have also gone and they gave mixed reviews as well. Almost everyone I have talked to since has said the wait staff is annoyingly overly attentive bordering on being rude.   There are other places in Cleveland just blocks away that are not only more upscale, but have better food and service all for the same price as Mallorca.   I'd skip this one and spend my money and time elsewhere."}
{"text":"Loved it! Great food, fantastic wine (Spanish Malbec a real unexpected treat). Lots of food, all great. Great service, and you feel like a family member from the second you arrive.  As a friend of ours said, at Mallorca in Cleveland, \"we ate, we exploded, the end\"!"}
{"text":"I came here while visiting a friend in Cleveland. I live within a ten minute drive of the iron kind section of Newark where there is a massive amount of Portuguese and Spanish restaurants. I eat it all the time and really enjoyed the food here. We ordered the stuffed salmon with lemon sauce. Personally I am not a huge fan of horse radish, which was used in the stuffing. Nor am I a fan of the way they stuffed the salon, I wS expecting some sort of bread Nd crab meat stuffing but this crabmeat stuffing tasted more like crab salad. However, I did still enjoy the salmon for the most part.   We also ordered an appetiser of friend calamari. It was mostly rings of calamari not the complete little squids which my friend was happy about. I thought it was going to be served with a more marinara based sauce but the sauce they use is almost like a hot sauce so be Precautious.  The service was excellent. That kinda made up for the fact that I wasn't a huge fan of the salon dish. I would definitely come back to this place but would order something else."}
{"text":"I was very excited to visit Mallorca as it had been 6 or so years since my last visit.  My last visit I left more than impressed, at the time they ran a spare rib special - SO DELICIOUS!  Jump to 2013: the atmosphere overall was nice, the bread, rice and veggies were delicious.  The servers also made the atmosphere really enjoyable, they made you feel like you were in Spain.  However, I came there to eat the food, and 'Meh, I've experienced better' is the best way to put it.  The scallops were chewy, they (had to) have used frozen shrimp in their entree stew (those little, mini shrimps, why even bother?) - just stick to the good stuff in the stew, the broth, the lobster and the mussels, don't try too hard.  The stuffed mushrooms tasted strong of crab (like canned crab not fresh crab) and the entree(s) were low-end mediocre.  I had the stuffed tilapia, boyfriend had the stew.  The chips also had a strange taste.  Mallorca gave away too many things as side dishes - they need Restaurant Impossible to stop in and address their overly large menu and consolidate it  to focus on the GOOD and FRESH stuff.  Long story short, for the high prices I was left more than unimpressed by their food.  I couldn't even eat the scallops they were so chewy, it really groused me out.  However I did appreciate the generosity in their serving such large sides, and the complimentary almond liquor shot after dinner (YUM!)  I almost forgot - the Sangria was GREAT (made in house, you could really taste all the ingredients) but food needs a LOT of work."}
{"text":"oh mallorca........i really want to love you. really. but i can't say that.  i am a fan of those yummy chips, but food wise, i just think that everything is mediocre. for a rather classy place with typically higher prices, i think i just expect more.  service is always good. i just think the food is alright. i know there are plenty of people around that love this place.  maybe i am overdue for a trip back. i won't say that i will never do that, but it's just not on my list of places i am dying to get back to."}
{"text":"My first experience here was terrific. Service was very attentive and knowledgable. The paella was as good as I've had at Basque restaurants in NY, LA and SF. The portions are almost too large partially because the sides come family style. The wine list is fairly large and reasonably priced. I highly recommend the rum cake for dessert to finish the evening. Fun, friendly and very tasty sums up a great dinner."}
{"text":"Only gave 2 stars because there is a big bowl of mints on the way out.   I'd recommend trying a different place."}
{"text":"This is the first tapas meal I've eaten in ages in which every dish was superb. We tried the filet mignon and shrimp dish(flavorful/perfectly cooked to med. rare), chorizo-stuffed clams(a must try) and calamari(wow). The sangria was deliciously authentic(seemed to include a $$ bordeaux, unlike most).   Portions were good and the food and service were phenomenal. Additionally, the ambiance here is very tasteful sans pretentiousness."}
{"text":"From one of the very very few Portuguese guys leaving in Cleveland... Food is OK at Mallorca but is so far away from real Portuguese or Spanish cuisine. Only real Portuguese thing are the wines and liquors, those I can even recommend specifically if somebody is interested. As far as Portuguese/Spanish food goes, please take a plane to the Iberian Peninsula and ask me for recommendations when you go there :)  P.S.: The service is nice, waiters are kind and do their best to serve you well. I had a wonderful bison steak, but Montana is pretty far from my hometown Lisboa, and the only bisons I know there live in the Zoo."}
{"text":"As I drive past Mallorca looking for a parking spot...this place looks promising.  The sign is colorful and fun and it has outside seating.  Inside, the decor is nothing special.  We are assisted by waiters dressed in suits with bow ties.  The waiters are probably the most polite and efficient waiters I've seen.   Except they did forget our Sangria, however it was worth the wait.  I ordered the Jumbo Shrimps stuffed with Crab meat and Mascapone Cheese for $23 while my partner in crime ordered a Seafood Casserole(?) for $25.  The portions were huge especially the Seafood Casserole.  I always like to take a picture of what I eat...but the more than helpful waiters started serving us our food and each other's.  I didn't even have to ask my partner if I can try their dish :p  Their food was a bit too salty for me.  Their plating and taste was nothing spectacular for a downtown restaurant with $20+dish.     Love the waiters, love the almond liquor at the end (asian restaurants give you fresh fruit at the end of dinner...well this place gives you a shot of almond liquor).  I'd come back just to visit the friendly staff but not so much for the food."}
{"text":"Technically I'd give it 3.5 stars.   The grandparents were in town, so my family decided a fancy meal was in order. We came to Mallorca because my mom had some great lunches here and because we all love seafood and were intrigued by their seafood menu.   The menu definitely lived up to our expectations! My dad ordered the casserole in green sauce and was totally blown away by the amount of seafood he was given--a giant heaping bowl! My grandparents enjoyed their sole stuffed with salmon and spinach and my paella was tasty and also chock-full of seafood and sausage (chorizo, yum!). The chorizo and scallops were well cooked, but the broth was a bit salty and the chicken a bit overcooked. My mom's stuffed salmon was half good, half awful. The stuffing was delicious and one of the salmon halves was cooked perfectly, but the other half was very fishy, very fatty, and basically inedible.   The place can definitely get loud--especially since the head waiter was very theatrical and enthusiastic in welcoming and describing the menu to people, but people would talk louder to have their conversations be heard, so he'd talk louder.... Etc. Etc. So it definitely got noisy, which made it difficult for my grandparents.   We also ordered the white sangria because we had never had it before and everyone except me is a white wine drinker. Sweet and full of fruit, but definitely was mixed with orange juice. I'd like to try the red, but the white wasn't really my thing. The complimentary almond liquor at the end of the meal was a nice touch, though.   I wish I could give half stars because I'd go for three and a half, but I guess I can give four because of the quantity of seafood. A few cons, other than the already mentioned noise. Also, my grandparents asked the head waiter to repeat a few of the specials, needing just two things clarified, but the head waiter launched into his spiel again, which confused them, and nothing was achieved and we went through the process again. We specifically asked to repeat just the salmon, but he did the whole thing multiple times! The pace also felt inconsistent. Everything was a but slow and relaxed at the beginning before the entrees came out, but then suddenly they were clearing all of our plates and we felt rushed. Plus the handwritten bill? Charming, maybe, but I'd like to be able to read what I me being charged for--especially since they brought us something we didn't order and initially charged us for it!   I'll come back to try the tapas out of curiosity, but I'd only recommend this place if you love seafood and don't mind a bit of boisterousness."}
{"text":"I had a pretty good experience, it was a little noisy and when we first walked in the greeter (person who sits us down) was Chillin at the bar; I'm over here thinking \"dude when are you going to seat us?\". Overall the food was good just don't order the garlic shrimp not what it seems like at all!!! Would love to visit again"}
{"text":"First timers here and this place by far exceeded our expectations. Enrique was our server, he did a fantastic job in every aspect. Super friendly and made everything on the menu sound appetizing (which it was). The crab stuffed tilapia was delicious. All meals were served with rice & veggies. Jumbo shrimp topped with crab meat, penne pasta, and the baby goat were also very good meals! Good price for the food & drinks you pay. Would definitely recommend and return for another dinner!!!"}
{"text":"Mallorca is amazing, I love it! We went there and ordered the paella which was great.  There's not that many places to get some paella, so we look for any excuse to go here.  The waiter was really friendly, and the ambience was very appropriate I thought.  It is pretty expensive, which is a downside.  But its nice to treat yourself every once and a while!"}
{"text":"In town for an evening on our way to Chicago we decided to stop in Cleveland to visit the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  Staying at the Marriott downtown after a long dive we were looking for a place close to our hotel that was within walking distance on a beautiful evening.  Inquiring at our hotel Mallorca was suggested plus the hotel offered us a 30% coupon.  Well it was exactly what the doctor ordered.  A close walk great cocktails and great seafood.  We were traveling with friends so we required seating for 10 and were seated right away.  It was a little early.  The place filled fast.  All the seafood was fresh and everyone was happy.  They even comped us shots as they presented our bill."}
{"text":"Spanish friend came into town and I recommended Mallorca. Mistake! Service was terrible. I had to ask the waiter if there were any specials. Years ago, I never thought of looking at the menu because I knew they had so many great specials, I would pick from them. Also the waiter missed items and he delegated service to bus waiters. Terrible for a 200 dollar bill for two."}
{"text":"The closest thing to eating in Spain that I have found since leaving Spain.  Waiters in bow ties and vests, tight seating, a long list of specials rattled off so quickly you'll have to have it repeated, big pours of wine, rich savory dishes, and even a cigarette machine outside of the bathroom.  The food is excellent.  The lamb shank was a highlight.  It is the restaurant I miss most since moving from Cleveland."}
{"text":"The service was excellent!  The food however was just ok.  Wife and I had the surf and turf- filet was good but the lobster tail was overcooked and tough.  Scallop appetizer was uneventful.  Was really excited about going there.  I just wish the food was as good as the wait  staff."}
{"text":"There are two waiters in this restaurant and a whole bunch of busboys.  We found them quite imposing, pushy and kind of forgetful.  The waiter towers over you and riddles off the specials in very loud, heavily accented english, and I felt that he was a bit snappy in answering our questions.  We also had to ask one waiter and two different busboys for an extra plate, which ended up taking twenty minutes to finally arrive.  Right before it came, we heard very loud voices from the kitchen, \"did you get their plate?\", \"oh no, I forgot!\"  The food is fairly decent, although my girlfriend did find the paella kind of one note.  I thought it was kind of amusing that they seemed to offer everything under the sun (mushrooms, lobster tail, tilapia, salmon...) stuffed with crabmeat and marscapone cheese.  I ordered the salmon stuffed as such - tasted a bit buttery and the marscapone cheese masked the crabmeat quite a bit, but the salmon itself was cooked fairly well.  I did like the portion sizes - all entrees come with sizable plates of veggies, rice and (unsalted) potato chips.  The place is supposedly classy and the waiters are in tuxedos, but really, half of the clientele were in jeans."}
{"text":"We went to Mallorca on a Thursday night, quite early for dinner, so it was very quiet,  it was definitely a romantic setting as well.  The general menu was more continental in flavor, and some of my Spanish favprites were missing (no paella?  Oh no!).   Their specials menu showed more Spanish influence, in my opinion, and was almost an entire menu in itself.  We both ended up ordering off of the specials menu.  The food was fabulous when it arrived, and the sangria and desserts were to die for!  The waitstaff were exceptional as well.  I would recommend Mallorca to anyone in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I've been dining at Mallorca for over 17 years. It used to be my favorite place in Cleveland. But over the years each experience has gotten worse and worse. The staff, service and food has not been the same since Jesus (the previous manager) passed away. The food is still pretty good but not as it was before. Jorge and Ricky are the best servers in the city and it's for them that I have continued to return; however I'm sad to say but I think my recent visit will be my last. I've loved Mallorca for years but I think it's time to let it go. It's just not the same anymore. I hope things improve again but if not I hope Jorge and Ricky go somewhere where their amazing customer service can still be enjoyed."}
{"text":"Overall, a decent restaurant, but it didn't meet my expectations for Spanish food.  I had fillet of sole stuffed with salmon and spinach.  The main entree was good as well as the rice.  But I give it 3 stars because it was missing those things that you normally see from 4 or 5 star restaurants like decent salad, fresh bread, more flavor and presentation.  However,  the bread is consistent with non*european Spanish food."}
{"text":"Went to Mallorca during an orchestra trip.  Our director got a recommendation from the hotel.  We had a party of 27 and were served family style.  Our waiter was relatively attentive, though it seemed like he wanted other tables to get better tips.  We started with a few appetizers, calamari, stuffed mushrooms, omelet/frittata type thing that I can't remember the name of, shrimp, and chorizo.  I'm not a fan of calamari, but the dipping sauce was delicious.  The fritomlet was yummy and the shrimp was fantastic.  I'm a huge shrimp fan so that was great.  The chorizo was delicious too.  Next we got our salads, large salads with a mustard vinaigrette dressing.  It also was yummy.   For our entrees we had paella, chicken marsala (i think), and salmon, along with veggies and chips.  The paella was awesome and I wish I could have taken some home.  I didn't try the chicken but it looked good, and the salmon was also good, a little too fishy for me, but still good.  I also tried the sangria, and it was fantastic.  I'd recommend it for anyone who enjoys sangria.  For dessert I got flan and it was melt in your mouth delicious.  Very creamy and not too rich.  Yums.  Mallorca kept the majority of the orchestra happy, the only people who really didn't like it a. didn't eat seafood, or b. we're in a bad mood because they didn't want to be on tour.  So Mallorca was great and I wish I had a reason to go back to Cleveland to try it again."}
{"text":"We went here the Friday before Christmas this year as a Christmas present to ourselves. First time ever being here but have heard many good things. We had the reservation set for 7 pm, I thought it would've been busier but it was not at all. I enjoyed the close parking next to the restaurant for $6, well worth it. The atmosphere and appeal this place has is awesome. Very authentic in the art work show casing Salvador Dali and Diego Rivera I thought was a nice touch. Our service was excellent and the food was great. The salad before the meal has a different dressing I've never tried but liked very much. For our meals, I had the stuffed Tilapa and he had the filet. Both were perfectly cooked and he said it was the best steak he's ever had. Good news to me! Every thing was served with \"potatoes\" that were really just chips as well as veggies. We must go back, what a great experience. The homemade Sangria looks appealing and will be worth a try for our next trip. All and all we spend about $70! Not Bad!"}
{"text":"The best service and the food was wonderful. They really made our birthday celebration great."}
{"text":"Very good food and absolutely outstanding service. The sangria was very good as well. I got the pollo mallorca and quickly cleaned my plate. I didnt catch out server's name but he had a mastery of the menu, quickly answered questions, and gave suggestions. They also handled my reservation of a large group very well. I hope to make it her again!!"}
{"text":"Best service in town. You will never find such a great service. We had around 5 people taking care of our table, 2 servers, and few assistance."}
{"text":"Our party of 6 really enjoyed this restaurant! All of our entrees were delicious; we also sampled several appetizers as well as dessert. The noise level was a bit high due to several large parties but not so loud that our table wasn't able to carry on conversation. The seafood selections are varied and SO good. Our favorites included the Shrimp in Garlic Sauce appetizer, Shell Fish Casserole in Garlic Sauce entree, and the Penne Pasta in Pink Vodka Sauce entree.  I would HIGHLY recommend Mallorca for any occasion!"}
{"text":"I'm a little bit of a snob here because I lived in Spain for two years.. So I've had these foods homemade. Having said that overall great place. To those who have not had it homemade, tasty food and good service. BEWARE, you get huge side dishes of rice and veggies and salads to start, so you will probably over order. Get a Rioja red wine, there's one for 30$/bottle and it's a good dry wine, well known in Madrid."}
{"text":"We made a reservation for 6, once we got there... no one greeted our table for about 30 minutes or so after we sat there. From there, we ordered drinks and no one came back for an hour... after ordering dinner, we got our appetizers fast but then sat for like an hour. Are meal wasn't served till exactly 2 and a half hours after we got there. At multiple points we thought that the kitchen/server forgot about us. One point, we considered just leaving and getting dinner some where else. I think our server was Enrique, we sat in the first room when walking in. The 3 times he came to our table during the time we were there, he was nice.... but he seemed way over his head and the place must have been under staffed.  Bread was tasty.  Salmon Stuffed with crab meat... delicious.  Rice, Veggies and Potatoes come with every meal. Rice - very bland rice, no flavor... very disappointing. Veggies - not thoroughly cooked through. Potatoes - hah. They came out as kettle chips with no seasoning/flavor.  My fiance got the Veal. It came out in 3 pieces. One piece was tougher then the other and the one of the other pieces were completely chewy. Being at the restaurant for so long and being so hungry, she couldn't get close to finishing it.   I grew up in the serving industry and it takes a lot to make me not like something....  at that, get online and make a post. But I felt very strongly in my time being wasted last night and the high prices point of everything we paid for.... I had to put my view online. I will never go back here, luckily I was with great friends and we were able to enjoy each others company throughout the experience.   Oh yeah, for the errors he made we were supposed to get a free pitcher of sangria.... it never came nor did it reflect on our bill. On a positive side, they have a giant bowl of mints on the way out."}
{"text":"I left Mallorca with arms crossed and eyebrows raised. The chips were pretty good, yeah, and I wasn't buying so it wasn't my place to complain. But I had had just about enough of the waiter dude being ridiculously overbearing. He was a large man, and his endless chatting and menu-selling was endearing for about 3 seconds, but he kept coming back to the table and asking me questions I couldn't understand and putting his hand on my shoulder and we're not friends, dude, I don't like you, please stop touching me.  I had the short ribs (I think it was a special) and they were alright. However, when I eat short ribs, I really expect some sort of flavor to stick out at me that isn't just the flavor of the rib itself. It was cooked well, sure, but it was definitely underseasoned and to me it just seemed like the chef doesn't taste his own food.  The place is known for seafood, of which I'm not a huge fan. I can eat it but I rarely enjoy it. It's probably worth a try if you love seafood.  I dunno about Mallorca. After one visit, I'm definitely not dying to go back."}
{"text":"A great location on the West 9 strip, Mallorca offers a wide variety of food and drinks, but the homemade sangria is by far above the rest. The food was average, way below what I was expecting due to the extreme amount of salt in almost every dish and the rather slow service.  The model used is having different waiters for each part of your meal;drinks, water, food, clearing plates etc. which seemed to cause a great deal of confusion. I am a patient guest, but that was pushing it.   In addition, for the price, the filet is to die for as it was said from a friend I was with. Check this place out and scratch another off the bucket list. I would recommend a quick drink, but not necessarily dining in for a full course meal."}
{"text":"I don't know what got into me. My craving for some paella led me to Mallorca despite all the not-so-great reviews about this place. The result = disappointment, to say the least (and deserved) When we arrived at this place, our host sat us down at a table and began explaining the menu + specials to us. Problem 1. I can't understand what he is saying. I understand they are trying to make things more \"authentic\" by using servers with a Spanish accent but people have to understand what you are saying.  Problem 2. Appetizers (Shrimp + garlic sauce; some soup) were too salty.  Problem 3. The paella didn't tasted ... meh. And it comes with \"Spanish potatoes.\" Basically over-baked Lays Chips. Not even kidding.  Problem 4. Price. Super expensive for what you get. 25+ bucks for most of the entrees.  If you want authentic Spanish food, don't even bother coming here. It's not worth it.  If you want a casual dinner, don't even bother coming here. It's too expensive for it to be casual.  If you want to take some one out for a meal, don't even bother coming here. You could probably use that money to go somewhere much nicer.  Honestly, I can't say anything good about this restaurant. I won't be going back. I hope you don't make the same mistake I made."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch the other day, the place was almost empty with just patrons. The place is actually huge with different dining sections.  I tried the tilapia fillet which is filled with crab meat. All entrees come with a side salad,Spanish saffron rice, grilled veggies and kettle chips.The food portion was very generous and they also give out complementary bread. The fish was perfectly cooked and the crab filling was the best part. All of this food was just for $13 bucks, this place is definitely a value of money which offers good flavors as well.  I will come back."}
{"text":"Took some friends here who were visiting from NYC, they told me they were shocked a restaurant like this was in Cleveland. The atmosphere was wonderful, the wait staff is very attentive and extremely polite. The food was definitely well worth the price paid. I will be going back very soon and can't wait!"}
{"text":"Not sure why, but my most recent trip to Mallorca didn't leave a wonderful taste in my mouth, as per usual.  I was expecting a great meal, but Mallora did not deliver.  The server was interesting and friendly, but the food wasn't.  It wasn't as good as I remember.  Could it be the new ownership?  Not sure.  The vegetables were not as soft and tasty, the rice was dryer than before, but at least the wine was good.  We also started chatting with a family next to us, who noticed my in-laws Puerto Rican accents.  That was fun.  I ordered the stuffed salmon and it was cooked well enough.  But the seafood stuffing it contained wasn't buttery and delicious like I remembered.  Also, the portion was smaller than before.  Unfortunately, the most memorable part of the evening was a black Lamborghini sitting outside awaiting for a rich man who was accompanied by a beautiful and busty blonde.  I doubt we'll go back."}
{"text":"Went here for NYE Dinner. Service was slow and rather unfriendly. The server was more concerned with his bigger tables and basically ignored our table of 2. Booked a early reservation to beat the crowd so we could get our drink on for NYE. I ordered the Paella which was probably one of the worst I have ever had. All the seafood was overcooked and rubbery and dry. The sausage they have is awesome. I had better expectations for this place. But it is cleveland and I guess the spanish/south american delicacy I was looking for was not very authentic. I probably would not return here."}
{"text":"Great service, good food.  Paella is probably some of the best in Cleveland.  The split lobster tail on top certainly was a surprise.  The very fresh and crisp salad was included with all entrees, and was quite good. Nice, tasty fresh fried in-house potato chips served as a free side.  This place is old school, just as I remember it 10 years ago.  If you have never been here before, give it a try, especially if you like seafood.  But there's plenty to choose from the land too, and it all looked quite tasty and well presented.  Classic place!"}
{"text":"Thrilled to eat here.   Went with parents and brother/sister-in-law on a Friday night. Seated without a wait at 8:30 pm, with a parking lot nearby.    And then, there was the service, food, and wine.  Wine first. They pour substantial glasses. Decent list, but the house red \"tinto\" is more than drinkable.   Food second. New York or Los Angeles quality. My mom had a stuffed trout that was very fresh and impeccably cooked and prepared. Neither overdone nor underdone. Also around the table were my seafood casserole in garlic (mussels, clams, scallops, even tiny lobster tails/crayfish tails), with delicious Spanish rice. Shrimp in garlic (served the same way, in a soup turreen). Swordfish. And more.  Everyone loved what they got.  Service was attentive without having to learn one's waiters' life stories. Spanish spoken. English fine.  We got seated in the quiet area to the right of the door, which was just right for not-so-young-anymore ears.  A revelation in downtown Cleveland. I had no expectations. Now, I do, if/when I return. I expect to have a great meal, and I don't think I'm going to be disappointed.  Well done, caballeros.   Probably pricy by Cleveland standards, but by coastal measures right reasonable."}
{"text":"I've been coming here on and off since it opened years ago.  It's got great ambience, just a fun atmosphere.   The location is awesome.  I really hope that they can rebuild a downtown around these types of places.  It's just a great location with great atmosphere, and awesome food.  Let me just say this.  I come here as often as I can when I'm visiting family in Cleveland.  I usually get just one thing and it's their soft-shell crabs.  I never had them before trying them here, years ago.  Since then, I have ordered them numerous times all over the country... Not once were they even in the ballpark of the soft shell crabs here at Mallorkas.  It's just fantastic.   The service is wonderful.  The paella is really excellent, lots of \"stuff\" in it and a great bargain.  You get amazingly good food and in substantial amounts too.    If you're visiting Cleveland or if you live there, this is a real treasure.    MANAGEMENT: There's always room for you in Chicago."}
{"text":"Absolutely awful! I got the chicken in white wine sauce which the meat had a very weird taste to it, a microwavable meal would have tasted better than that. The sides were cold and considering it was some white rice with veggies it might as well been a microwavable meal. On top of the food being cold, the waiter tried to add a $10 bar charge to my bill which I believe he was just going to pocket. I realized the extra charge was on there once my card was already ran, so he just handed me a $10 bill and that seemed very sketchy. Another person in my party was handed back the wrong credit card (someone's card who wasn't part of our party). Seems like they are doing some sketchy things, charging way too much for the quality they are delivering."}
{"text":"Well, after reading the reviews, I thought this would be a perfect spot to check out on New Years Eve. The space is lovely. I know that they are known for their service, but to me, it felt forced, not at all genuine and completely over the top.  We ordered the sangria, it was decent. I've had better. The bread came out and it was moldy. Being as I've spent years in food service, I know this can happen unintentionally so I very quietly called over a gentlemen (not our server) and whispered to him that he may want to check the other bread before it goes out and that I wasn't upset at all, just wanted him to know. The server comes rushing over, loud as can be and says something is wrong with the bread, I'll get you a new one right away. I assured him it was no biggie and he wouldn't drop it. Plus it just brought attention to a situation that didn't require attention. So there was that.  I ordered the stuffed shrimp and my husband ordered the paella. The seafood was cooked well and there was enough of it, but the rice was awful. It didn't have the crisp bottom that is what you look for with paella. Literally, we make a better paella at home. It was rather disappointing. The whole experience was just eh. Our bill for those two dishes and a pitcher of sangria was $80 + with tip. Not a lot to spend on a meal on NYE, but not worth it for that meal."}
{"text":"Being a firm believer in Brasa, I decided to give Mallorca a try this weekend. Walking through the door, I was not disappointed. The restaurant had an upscale feel while still being a bit quaint. The hostess must have known this was our date night and brought us to a lovely table near the back . She asked us if we wanted a wine menu, and I thought this was incredibly thoughtful. Many places seemed to be obsessed with selling wine, and it's nice not to have a million menus thrown at your face. But, it's Spanish food...the whole thought behind it is eating, drinking, and enjoying. So I couldn't pass up the heavy wine book.  The food itself was excellent, and the wine pours were hefty. I was happy to see they offered quite a few things besides seafood. I ordered chicken breasts stuffed with mozzarella and spinach. My boyfriend ordered the stuffed lobster tails, and besides being delicious, they looked like a work of art! Surprisingly, my favorite part of the meal was the salad. The dressing was almost a spicy, creamy French. I was practically licking the plate it was so good!  The only reason I will not give Mallorca 4 or 5 stars is the service. Our main waiter was pretty good at answering all our questions, but the rest of the staff that stopped by really lacked professionalism. We went without water for awhile, and our bread was never refilled. Most importantly, I have a pecan allergy, so I always have to ask to see if desserts contain any pecans. This woman stopped by with a giant dessert tray, and a few looked absolutely amazing. But, when I asked the woman if the chocolate cake-like dessert contained any nuts, she just gave me a shrug and a blank stare. I asked her again, thinking she maybe didn't hear me, and she gave me a strange, dirty look. I told her it was really important to find out before ordering anything, and again...the same spaced-out look. I don't think she spoke enough English to understand the question. Even if she herself doesn't know, I found it amazing that she wouldn't have the common sense to ask another staff member. We wound up picking a dessert that we were pretty sure would be nut-free, but it wasn't what we really wanted."}
{"text":"I think I have a new favorite restaurant. Absolutely excellent. I ordered the salmon filet stuffed with crab and scallops; it was one of the best meals I have ever had. It is definitely on the pricey side but the portions are large, every meal comes with bread, and there is complimentary sangria throughout the meal.   My server was very entertaining and had the menu memorized, and absolute professional. I would recommend this place to anyone that likes Medit"}
{"text":"I had heard a lot about Mallorca, and was excited to go there.  Dropped off the kids and headed out with my wife.  I was expecting a typical high-end dining experience: quiet dining room, attentive waiters, relaxed ambiance.  Instead, when we stepped inside, it was intense to every sense.  The volume was very loud.  The decor was quite busy.  The demeanor of the host and bus boys seemed frazzled.  Perhaps they were understaffed that night.  We decided to sit outside on the small patio, which was probably the smartest thing we did all night, as the patio was very relaxed and we were able to have normal conversation.  The menu looked great.  Most entrees will cost you twenty-something dollars.  After taking our drink order, the waiter didn't return for our entree order for a long time.  Once he did return for the entree, he rattled off the specials very fast and never made eye contact at us, looking all around as he spoke.  I am not sure if this was because he was preoccupied and very busy that night, or him just being his normal self.  It was strange and came across as rude, though I don't believe he intended that.  My wife ordered the paella and I went with yellowfin tuna.  Both entrees were very large, cooked perfectly, and delicious.  It did take a LONG time for the food to come out, but it had been given great attention to detail, so I wasn't too annoyed.  I found the salad to be very nice and the house dressing was a bit spicy, just perfect.  The house potatos are kettle chips, with NO seasoning/salt on them.  This was a bizarre side dish and seemed completely out of place, my wife and I have been to Madrid and don't recall ever being served bland potato chips.  Side comment: at least some of the bus boys do not know any English.  At the table next to us, the wife had gotten up to use the ladies room.  When the bus boy came with the dessert tray, the husband repeatedly told the bus boy that he needed to wait for his wife to return before choosing a dessert, and the bus boy didn't understand, leaving confused.  Once the wife did return to the table, it was a hassle again (the host helped) to get the dessert tray back.  I am not against hiring people to bus who don't know English, but please teach them basic words like \"wife\" \"ladies room\" \"please come back\" etc.  I struggled, do I give them 3 or 4 stars?  In the end I will go with 3 stars overall.  But worthy of 4 stars if you like seafood, get to dine outside, and the waiter is on top of things that night."}
{"text":"Will never go there again! The chicken tastes like that one Chinese spot down the street that you would never go to because it's gross!! And the service took forever!!"}
{"text":"I don't know why I'm seeing all the negative comments on here from recent visits. My girlfriend and I went last night and it was fantastic. The servers were very attentive, almost to a fault! All of their recommendations were great. We both loved our appetizers and meals (calamari, Spanish sausage, paella & stuffed chicken). Also, don't miss out on the sangria! Definitely plan on going back, it's a nice break from all the more modern restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Decent Spanish food at best. Paella was the best thing but it still had dry mussels and overlooked lobster tails. Rabbit was terrible, sea bass was ok, bison was cooked medium, and appetizers were just okay. House sangria wasn't too great either. Pretty much had a salesperson as out waiter trying to get us to buy the whole menu. Come on now.."}
{"text":"Fantastic sangria and garlic potatoes! Wish we had time to try more food but we will be back for the goat for sure!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for many years and it is my absolute favorite place for great Spanish (Iberian) food. The key to Mallorca's success is consistency. You will find the owner of the restaurant there as well as some of the wait staff who have been there since it opened.  I've never had a disappointing meal there. The food is plentiful and the wait staff is attentive and always quite pleasant. The service was voted best in Cleveland.  The restaurant is well known for its seafood dishes, and though I'm not a huge seafood person, I'm told the paella is excellent. Mallorca has many other great menu offerings as well. They make their own homemade potato chips, and the gazpacho is superb.  The last time I was there I decided to get the Spanish coffee, a recommended treat. It's a wonderful blend of coffee and liquor, spices, and topped off with whipped cream. The drink is prepared right in front of you and the gentleman preparing ours was happy and exuberant, so it was served with lots of flair and smiles.  Even though this is a nice restaurant with linen tablecloths and nicely dressed waiters, this isn't a place where one has to come dressed to the nines. You can come relaxed, in comfortable clothes, and still be treated well. The last time I went I wore a nice pair of jeans and a sweater and felt right at home. Laurie, the owner, stopped by my table, chatted with me and my girlfriend, then asked to snap a picture of us. She really seemed to be enjoying herself, just like the rest of the staff, who were friendly and welcoming.  Don't miss this opportunity to enjoy some great food and Cleveland's best service!"}
{"text":"Worst service and not clean at all. I found a bug from my meal. Can you even imagine that? It is dirty, disgusting. The service is so bad... they get a lot to learn"}
{"text":"I had heard \"Mallorca\" mentioned a few times when I ask people about their favorite restaurant in the city. It had been on my list awhile and I was really looking  forward to the the evening that I ventured over. Unfortunately, I didn't find that it lived up to my expectations.   The waiter was great! He was a fun Spanish character and even though I didn't really understand him, he really had me looking forward to the rest of my experience. We started with an appetizer of crab stuffed mushrooms.  The crab was a little too fishy.  Dinner was ok- I had a chicken breast with a lemon sauce- which tasted more like a chicken and dumplings sauce.  Not a hint of lemon. The Sangria, on the other hand, was wonderful!   Now, I am not a conissour of authentic Spanish or Portugese food, so to be fair I should say that it might have been the most authentic dishes in the United States. However, I just didn't find that the dinner lived up to the expectations that I had for this place. I don't think that I would go back. For the price, I can get the chicken and dumplings at Cracker Barrel.  But then, there was the Sangria................"}
{"text":"Top notch!  This place has the most incredible seafood.  It's pricey, but worth it. Try the Crab- Filled Lobster For Two."}
{"text":"I went on a Sunday night, it wasn't that busy. The level of service we received was attentive but not overbearing. Started with calamari--lightly fried and served with a spicy sauce--delicious and made it really stand out from typical calamari you find at other restaurants.  Mallorca's knows how to do seafood right. The Chilean sea bass special was cooked perfectly. My only complaint was the paella, for the most part delicious (filled with seafood, well seasoned) but not traditional as i was expecting (no crispy toasted bottom) which was a little disappointing. The portions are huge, btw.  For dessert, I got tiramisu and a cannoli to go since we were going to see a movie and snuck it in. Packed it well and they were a great end to an evening."}
{"text":"I was here last weekend and I was so disappointed. The food and service was not the best. It was a pretty slow Friday night but the servers seemed frantic and rushed. Our waiter was very aggressive! I wasted $30 on a dish that I barely touched. My boyfriend had prime rib and it was mediocre. The decor was so outdated too. Overall is was ehhhh. Nothing worth coming back for."}
{"text":"Went for our second visit to Mallorca today for a relaxed Sunday afternoon dinner. It was amazing, as was our first visit. The wait staff is actually Spanish, so I don't think they intend to be overbearing or imposing. They are so friendly, anticipate every need, and always help us decide what to order. We had sangria, fried calamari, paella, and a swordfish special. It was all fantastic. A table near us ordered the sea bass special... about the two fish entrees, the steaks were HUGE. Well worth the money paid! We always order the paella, simply because of the amount of seafood in the dish, it's insane! You don't find the same size seafood portions anywhere else around here. We'll go back for the amazing seafood and the superb staff!"}
{"text":"We came here with a group after we did another activity on a weeknight. The place was pretty empty. The service was super. They were on top of water glasses and drinks and they were VERY attentive to our needs.  We all ordered something different off of the menu. The prices are a bit hefty. The food was just, meh. I had shrimp, and while they gave me a HUGE portion, it really wasn't that good and I didn't even save it. My husband had a similar experience. He ordered a fish dish, the portion size was good, but it really didn't taste like anything.  I SO wanted to like this place because the service was so good, but after that experience, it would take a lot to get me back there for the food."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Not only was the food amazing. The staff was exceptionally friendly and accommodating. It is rare to have such a friendly staff nowadays who seems to actually enjoy being at work. My boyfriend and I will definitely be coming back, and will definitely be bringing friends to share the experience."}
{"text":"This place rules.  A friend and I split a paella, and HALF a lobster came with it. There are scallops dotted all over and clams and mussels. It's pricey ($26) but it's a perfect paella for two if you're both ambitious with portions but it's realistically food for four.  They also have a house sangria mix that is fruity and easy to drink. The pitcher deal is better than the price per glass. I would recommend this place for a date or a birthday gathering."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend to grab a dinner and catch up, and it was a lot nicer than we expected. We were just walking around the area to see what we could eat and when we went in, we were a bit under dressed.   This place specializes in Spanish food and they had a bunch of great dishes like the lamb shank as well as a lot of seafood. I had the lobster ravioli which was delicious and also quite a large portion (see picture).   Although it was very expensive, it was a really good meal and the service was pretty good as well. The restaurant is extremely beautiful so as you admire the inside environment, you can also enjoy a nice glass of wine. Really great place to take people on a date and it is def. an older crowd."}
