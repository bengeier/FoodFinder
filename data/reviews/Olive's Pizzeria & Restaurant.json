{"text":"I thought the food was very good. My wife and I had lunch. We started with a dinner salad followed by two entrees. She had gnocchi and I had chicken marsala. They were both very good. It has the ambience you find in Italy. There was some outdoor seating. It is a restaurant I shall return to. Plenty of food for a reasonable price."}

{"text":"My wife and I went to Olive's just this evening and had a most wonderful experience...The restaurant is cozy and reminiscent of tiny bistro.  Upon entering you are greeted by the chef and owner Tim who is more than welcoming and makes you feel at home immediately.  The food selection runs the Italian gamut...pizzas, pasta, salads, as well as great looking sandwiches and desserts.
   I went for the gnocchi and my wife choose the pasta rustica...The gnocchi were butter soft and the homemade vodka sauce was killer ( get this dish! ), while my wife's rustica was sausage-y goodness!
   The place is BYOB, however there is a liquor store next door that'll more than hook you up...
   Go and you will love it, the owner, the ambiance...Oh yeah, and Elvis has been known to make appearances there!  I highly recommend this restaurant...Come with an empty stomach and be ready to take home a pizza to tide you over until your next visit!"}
{"text":"I have been to Olive's twice and both times have been great!. We found Olive's because it is a BYOB place and there is no cork fee. My wife and I went had a great dinner and enjoyed our own bottle of wine that we brought in. We met the owner's Tim and Kim. Kim brought us our glasses for the wine and recommended two of the specials that were on the board for the evening. We went with a toasted ravioli trio (mushroom, veal and spinach) and pasta rustica. Both were so good but we were seeing the pizzas come out of the kitchen and knew we needed to come back and try one. We did come back this time with some friends and to our surprise they had live music playing. The pizza was the best I have ever had and can't wait to come back again."}
