{"text":"Came here for Taco Tuesday. Although the $1 tacos weren't bad, the 4-slice pizza, cheese sticks, and chicken tenders were the worst food we have ever had at a restaurant. The pizza tasted like it was from a box and the chicken tenders were very subpar. I think my high school had better. Not a bad deal for happy hour drinks though."}
{"text":"Love this place. We hosted an event there for about 80 people and everyone had a great time.  The food, drinks and space was perfect!  More importantly... The staff was amazing!!  Kudos to Jamie, Sean, Sarah and everyone...   You guys rock!!"}
{"text":"It was 30 degrees outside and the fans were running, we asked to have the fans turned off because it was already freezing. The bar was not packed and it is a non smoking bar to have the fans running on full blast. We asked 2xs to have the fans turned down or off. Uncomfortable to be in a bar wearing a coat to enjoy a drink."}
{"text":"Food: It was a shareable portion; your standard bar food.

Music: The past few visits were a miss on music.  Music should be catered to the crowd and make people want to dance.  Celine Dion just doesn't get me to dance.

Server: The server was fine at the start.  She asked for an ID and cc to keep a tab but advised me that I can pay cash upon closing out.  As the night progressed, she was harder to locate.  When I closed out, she asked if I wanted to pay cash to which I replied yes.  I paid with cash.  Long story short, WTH did I get a charge on my cc???

Sadly, this is NOT the first time I, or my group, got charged incorrectly.  I did give this server the benefit of the doubt because she seemed better than other servers our group had in the past.  So this is a warning that you should ALWAYS check your bill when you get it.  

Or maybe they just prey on the drunkies (assuming you get to that point) and hope they don't notice..."}
{"text":"My go-to place for happy hour on Fridays! $3 beers & $4 mixed drinks plus $5 apps. Need I say more? If you go, the nachos & pepperoni rolls are a must try! 

At night the restaurant/bar turns into a night club with a bunch of fun lights & good music. I really like the vibes and that it's a place for all ages! I'll for sure be back."}
{"text":"We had my friends 30th birthday party here. This is actually the 3rd birthday party we've thrown here.. The VIP is the best. We love having a place to call home base..Also loved the hot waitress we had. She was hustling all night for us.. We had about 15 people who are big drinkers so we kept her busy. Drinks are fairly priced. I don't feel like I spent more than an average night out in the city.. We didn't try the food except the pizza we ordered to take back to the hotel across the street. And from what I remember it was good. I have been in for lunch before and I love the cheese sticks.. Definitely will be back.. Thanks Buckhead!!!"}
{"text":"Seems like the place is run by teenagers. Bartenders squawking to servers about their personal life drama, and sitting on their phones BEHIND THE BAR.  Didn't get service after our first round, and after stating we will be paying cash at the end, being ignored, and someone running our card when asking if we needed anything else and we said no, NO. Unless you want to be treated like you are at a strip club with money sitting out in front of you to get attention, I do not recommend."}
{"text":"I'm usually that person that gives everyone a good review and I have to say I was really disappointed with this bar. I went for the Halloween celebration and they had a live band that was terrible!!!! The DJ was amazing and they kept interrupting the DJ for this aweful band! I was very disappointed with the whole experience because of the band. They had them on at 1am and the whole place cleared out because they were so terrible! We had VIP service and our server Christina was exceptional! That girl deserves a raise for how hard she worked but it doesn't excuse the terrible atmosphere! Thank you Christina for being the only positive in our night."}
{"text":"my last visit to this particular bar was probably one of the worst experiences.... i visit this bar almost every weekend and this last time i walked away from the group that i was with to use the restroom and i come back to find my full beer taken by one of the servers that were cleaning up because it was close to closing time... it is uncalled for and i didn't appreciate it. i did confront the bartender about it and there was nothing that he was willing to do about it. the service here is normally great but this particular night not so much."}
{"text":"A couple of friends and I got together the weekend of St. Patrick's Day to celebrates my birthday and St. Paddy's Day.  We gathered a few more people and bar hopped all day long and the first place we stopped at was this place.  It was already crowded at 8 in the morning when we got there!  That is always a good sign.  The drinks were strong.  They had great booty-shaking music.  Fun party atmosphere and a great live band too!  We did go to other bars, but we kept coming back to this one. 

I will make sure to go back to Buckhead next time I'm in PIT!"}
{"text":"Buckhead has always been one of my favorites. The managers and bartenders make it special because they are so personal."}
{"text":"Didn't even get in. After Steeler game on Sat Night . Went there to get drinks and maybe apps.  We went in. Door guy on 12-3-15 said our friend had a ski like pants on and said his pants were not proper entire.  Said if he stripped to next layer of jeans or kakky's. He was.  Good. Not. We left went to next pub spent 200$.   f u a hole door guy you suck!"}
{"text":"This seems like a cool place but dear merciful heaven above what is the horrible putrid smell that emanates from this place? It literally is enough to gag you. Everytime I walk past the interior entrance the smell hits me in the face and I want to vomit. It's a combination of stale beer, vomit, the pink stuff they sprinkle on vomit, mold, dirty water in a bucket, and dry rotting wood mixed with a bin of Jason Vorhees old jock straps where a mother skunk has just given birth and is feeding from a jar of old mayonnaise., and spoiled milk. It's milky in nature, yes, the smell has a hefty mass and texture to it with the slightest tinge of singed metal accented by unsubtle notes of stale decay. You can physically feel it's presence stalking you as you enter from the outside. Caressing at first and then blam a sucker punch to your olfactory core. Am I the only one who notices this? Has station square gone nose deaf? So foul. So nasty, the memory of it alone whilst writing this is making me nauseous. Blech..so foul , so so foul!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time this past weekend for a birthday party. There is some kind of deal where you get bottle service half off if you bring 10 people on your birthday. Plus we got free shots, free cover, and the birthday girl got $.01 drinks.Despite the fact that we were taking up prime couch space and hardly spending any money, the service was great. Our waitress kept coming back to replace the carafes and see if we needed anything even though her section was very busy.  

The only problem we had was we were sitting in a section that was all tables and nowhere near the dance floor, yet the music was still incredibly loud. It is frustrating to be sitting at a table not be able to hear someone who is five feet away. That said, they play a fun mix of 90s music and recent top 40 that most people who were not trying to talk seemed to enjoy."}
{"text":"We reserved a table for New Year's Eve last year. Had a 3-course meal with sparkling wine and miller high life. Not a bad value but around 10  the crowd changed a lot. A bunch of young kids  early 20s came in for the count down and the music was so loud you couldn't talk to the person next to you. The server was really nice and kept us well stocked in the drink department. Probably wont be back for another big event but a weekday when it's less crowded should be fine."}
{"text":"I personally like this place a lot! I like the atmosphere and the last time I was there was one of my favorite nights out in the 'burgh. Definitely a place to try if you have never been there before."}
{"text":"My 10 year class reunion was at Buckhead.  Buckhead provided us with a private area for our party.  We also received finger foods (meatballs, cheese sticks, pepperoni rolls, chicken fingers and cookies).  It was $30 per person for the area and the food.  The music selection was perfect for 90's babies!  Lot's of 90's songs.  Their wine selection was very minimal and I thought their prices were kind of high.  Parking can also be very expensive and limited."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with my experience at Buckheads Saloon. I normally am not impressed with chain bars and restaurants and maybe...just maybe I expect too much or I'm very picky. The service was very good this evening. We had a private VIP Booth and I ordered the Sampler Appetizer actually 4 of them for the group. For a bar of this type they were actually very fair. The cheese sticks and pepperoni rolls had a won ton type wrap on them making them crunchy. Drinks were a little pricy but this was a Station Square Bar. All in all my picky butt would recommend this place for a get together."}
{"text":"Rented out a \"cabin\" for my friends 22nd birthday a couple weeks ago, the deals were great from 10-12 and the service was even better. Our bottle service waitress' name was Ashley. For how rowdy and loud our group was because of the birthday celebration Ashley was always there making sure we had a drink in hand and were having a great time. For a great celebration/birthday Buckheads is a great place, located in Station Square. Ask for Ashely for bottle service she really busted her ass for us!"}
{"text":"My wife and I visited Friday around happy hour. Very impressive food, staff and drink specials. Very clean establishment as well. Pepperoni rolls were slamming. Music genre seemed off for the establishment appearance and feel. Felt like country or classic rock would've been more fitting. We are visiting from out of town and the server, Caitlyn, really made us feel at home."}
{"text":"Fun place to watch Steelers and Penguins games. Plenty of Tvs and places to sit to enjoy your time with friends. Drinks are a good price, food is typical bar food but good. Staff is friendly and attentive. Fun place to go out and dance on weekends without the overcrowding"}
{"text":"OK so for drinks only, this place is your usual bar in a touristy part of town.  For eating, the food is pretty weak.  I had wings, and one of their speciality sandwiches which were both terrible.  Service was fine though so I don't blame the servers.  But this place is much better just for drinking.  The best thing about the place that gets it it's second star is the photo booth which is great since it's a true film photo booth (not digital prints)."}
{"text":"Cool specials on beer. Food good. Staff nice. Little on pricey side but fun nights like Friday 13th horror movie trivia make this place worth it."}
{"text":"All I know is that they had 2 bar tenders when there should have been 4 so I waited for 15 minutes to get a drink.
I ordered 3 things and out of these three, none of them were available.
The atmosphere is pretentious.
It's over priced and a stupid place.
I will never return.

Pros- Super soft couches and not too many people look like Jersey Shore Chavs.
Cons- Literally everything else"}
{"text":"2 Words:  $2 Beer.  The appetizer we had wasn't that good.  We had the pizza roll.  We'll try something else next time.  I would give this place a second chance."}
{"text":"Worst place in Pittsburgh! A group of us went there for lunch while in town for work. We were the only people in there and the music was ear shattering. A person in our party is hearing impaired so we asked the waitress (Hannah) if the music could be turned down so we can have a conversation. She happily did so. The two kids behind the bar said something to the waitress and one went over and turned the music back up.... even louder and then stared at us as he went back to the bar! Food was gross, the waitress was very nice, and the other two kids need to find a job somewhere else. AVOID THIS PLACE UNLESS YOU LIKE GROSS FOOD AND DISRESPECT!"}
{"text":"Great food, drinks, and bar staff.  I feel like I'm here just about every weekend! 
Happy hour is fun. I have to say $1 Taco Tuesdays are my favorite!"}
{"text":"So I've been to buckheads many times over the years, and each trip is different. Yesterday I went for happy hour. From 5 til 7 they have a pretty decent drink menu consisting of $3 beers, $4 wells, and $5 wines! I stuck with summer shandy, which is a treat this time of year. My friends ordered from the appetizer happy hour flat bread menu. Decent I suppose. I just had the chicken fingers and fries. Nothing wrong with that sometimes! the bar was so empty tho! The bartender assured that they were having a party of 400 come in at 9. Keep in mind this is a Thursday night! We didnt believe it! We ended up going to another bar, and on our walk back... there was a giant line to get in!! I couldn't believe it! Buckheads, you never fail to surprise me."}
{"text":"I don't want to be too unfair to this place - I suppose if I was still a 20-something looking to get blitzed in a non-dive bar that was inexplicably decorated by the Sportsmen's Guide, this would be the place that I would head to.
 However, this time it was just me and the wife some randomly stopping in a place to have some food and drink while watching the Steelers game.  It wasn't really good for this purpose.

  First the good parts. The table service was fine, and we enjoyed the food. She had a steak hoagie and fries, that while over priced at $14.95, was enormous and quite good.  I had a plate of wings, which were also good.  Obviously nothing special to them, Franks and some spices on a nice, meaty wing.  Wings are not something that you have to do spiff to get right. And these were definitely done right. Also, $2 New Castle drafts were a nice surprise.  

 The AV system was a disappointment.  Yes, they had several TVs, but some seats did not have a clear view. None of the TVs were HD. The sound system was awful.  The DJs PA system, aimed at ear-level, crank several levels too loud for the size of the room and the number of people in it.   Shoddy and unprofessional.

 When we moved to the bar, things went downhill.  First of all, the drink special actually ended two hours into the game.   Now, in a practical sense, this meant my draft price went from really cheap  to cheap, so I don't have much to complain about. However, I think it's just good customer service to inform the customer when a special price is ending.  And that's the main problem I had with this place. The bar service was dreadful. There were always 3 or 4 bartenders, and at most one of them could be seen actually serving a customer at any time.  I literally had to try multiple times to wave down one of the wandering bartenders in a 3/4 empty bar just to order another round.  

 This inattention led to another more serious problem when I got my bill and I found a drink on it from another table. Yes, just one mistake, and just for a few dollars, but it was caused by a new guy trying to figure out the register, while his cooworkers just ignored him (we witnessed this. Other bartenders were inexplicably hand washing dozens and dozens of glasses in the bar sink rather assist him).  No one was rude, it's just that they obviously weren't interested in doing there jobs at anything other than a minimal level. Probably OK for the drink-your-face off frat crowd, but not good enough for actual adults,"}
{"text":"I gave 2 stars because the staff is very friendly and the bar and restaurant are clean.  There are many screens to watch a game and kitschy decor.  The beer selection is lame and the food is extremely average.  

I had \"The Mario\" Burger which was served on a fresh bun and accompanied by a mound of hot crispy fries (the other star).  I asked for a side of mayo and got a cup of shiny, translucent around the edges beige stuff I DID NOT EAT!  It looked as if it were scraped from the pan in the chilling table and had been there for days.  There's a Buca Di Beppo down the sidewalk...  I wish I'd gone there."}
{"text":"Positively the worst Caesar chicken salad I have ever had in my life.  I wasn't expecting gourmet but I was expecting edible.  The atmosphere was fun, the server was friendly and very apologetic (it wasn't his fault that the food sucked).  I have been here for drinks before, which was a good time, but unless you're really hammered and don't really care so much about what you're eating, it's acceptable."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night and was really surprised at how empty it was.  There was a $5 cover because they had a DJ. Drink prices were about what you would expect. Crowd was late 20's to mid 30's which was nice."}
{"text":"So we went to a great wedding on the Gateway Clipper and tried to go for a night cap with friends at the Buckhead Saloon. We are the 13 and 14th person in our group, I have my ID and my wife doesn't, so they won't let us in. 

Combined between us we are 108 years old!  And no, I'm not 90, we're close in age. Are you kidding me?  The muscle head at the door was a TOTAL tool bag!  Once again the death of common sense in America...

So sad...."}
{"text":"I stopped in here at either the best time or the worst time, depending on what suits your fancy, meaning, it was completely dead. I walked in to this taxidermist's wet dream, log-cabin bar in Station Square and looked around with a \"Is this place even open?\" look on my face. Apparently it was, so I sat down at the bar to get something to eat/drink. 

Menu selections were pretty standard with a few unique local twists so I decided to try the Pittsburgheese Cheesteak Naan Pizza, a thin-crust with cheddar cheese sauce, mozzarella, provolone, shaved steak, onions, mushrooms, green peppers...and French fries. Sounded interesting and it was actually pretty decent. The Happy Hour special was $2 New Castle pints, so that was a no-brainer.

The bartender was a cool, personable guy and the service was excellent, since I was the only patron at the time. From what I've read, it gets much livelier at night/weekends, so I was content to enjoy a semi-quiet meal before heading back to the hotel."}
{"text":"Went to Buckheads on a Thursday during happy hour for a beloved colleagues farewell outing. 

Number 1 they don't have Coors Light on draft that's a big no no for me. 

Number 2 they had a bar tender in training. That almost always proves to be a disaster.  I ordered a Coors Light bottle and was given a Miller Light instead. 

Buckhead is trying to do some fusion bar menu which leaves a lot to be desired. I ordered cheese sticks because I thought I'd play it safe...well that was a mistake. The cheese sticks were egg rolls with a cheese filling and were hollow like almost no cheese in side.   Who does that Cheese is not a primary ingredient in almost any Asian dish and did not work at all inside of an eggroll. 

The only happy hour special they were offering was buy one get one free Miller Light Pitchers. How about no thanks! Needless to say I will not be rushing back to Buckhead Salon anytime soon."}
{"text":"Do you love fist pumping bros converging with several bachelorette parties?  A siren going off every 3 minutes to let you know you're having a good time while a girl standing on the bar pours free shots down your throat?

There are a lot of people having fun here.  And while I laughed out loud at this ridiculous scene, I'm not all for it. Especially when I have to pay a cover for a place as crappy as Buckhead.

Buckhead is basically a frat party, except people try to pretend that it's better than that.  It's not."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time going here!!!

I came in for late lunch around 3pm and stood in the doorway for almost 10 minutes till I was greeted.  Three servers were too busy standing around doing nothing by the food window but gossip than to acknowledge, greet, and seat me.

After I finally got a table, the server I had was fine...she seemed busy with other tables and since I was alone, I guess I was not a priority.  I finally placed my order after waiting what seemed like forever.

Please be advised, if you order a burger, you can ONLY get them cooked well done!!!!  The server said it was a restaurant rule!  I tried a Burogi ( a burger with 2 Pierogis on top of it), and although it had decent flavor, it would have been better if not cooked well done.  

She dropped my check only after I had to flag her down and ask her for it.  I had to get to the river cruise that was next door.

I should have just gone to one of the chain restaurants that was in Station Square, but wanted to try a Pittsburgh place.  If you want bad service and overcooked burgers, than this is the place to go!!!!"}
{"text":"Have been here a number of times with colleagues from work...nothing special.  My wife and I went there Saturday night to attend  a work colleagues 40th birthday and just because my wife stated we had never been asked for IDs before the \"bouncer\" at the door made her take her license out of her wallet.  When I told him calmly that that was not cool he refused me entrance.  I didn't raise my voice or call him names. I'm too old and too civilized for that.  That's what happens when you put a little bit of authority in some cretin's hands. I won't claim racism but can't help thinking that played into it. Stay away from this place.  I know I won't be going back.

Jaime - you are missing the point with your apologetica.   First, my wife and I were at Buckheads on Good Friday at a retirement party for a work colleague.  We arrived a little after 6:30pm and came in through........you guessed it...the back door !  So I guess under age drinkers didn't try to get in before security starts working.  Second, your security personnel are not following the procedure you stated in your reply.  My wife was in front of me and when he asked her for ID she had to go into her bag.  While she was doing that I showed him mine.....and guess what....you got it..... I wasn't asked to take it out of my wallet.  Nor did several people in front of us.  Lastly, you miss the point of my complaint entirely and why I won't go back nor encourage my colleagues to host parties there.  Neither my wife or I acted rude, loud or threatening.  We did not call him names or even look at him nastily.  My wife merely stated that we had never been ID'ed there while she was rummaging through her bag.  She showed him the license and then he proceeded to tell her to take it out of the wallet. Would that not look to you as being petty given that he looked at mine and didn't ask me to take it out? But that is not even the point.  The point is that at no time were our actions, gestures or language inappropriate and therefore did not rise to the level of justifiable cause for denying me entrance.  I had said my peace and turned away from him when he gestured to the hostess not to let me in.  Sorry you got it wrong and so did your bouncer.  And your defense only makes me more convinced that the staff needs better training.  BTW my name is M I G U E L.  Not M I Q U E L.  A very common Spanish name."}
{"text":"Overpriced, not as advertised! Walked in at 4:30pm on a Thursday (their hours say they're open then) was told by a guy \"we're not open, come back in like an hour\" thought it was odd, but tried the place again later that night and the kitchen closes mad early. Pretty lame spot. Not worth the $$."}
{"text":"The people who work here are great the food is ok, but the place does not smell great. If you've ever been to a fraternity party basement it has that stench.  Honestly I did see a roach there once. However if you've eaten out and believe that roaches are in every restaurant somewhere you're being naive. They do have TV's every where and this is a great spot for happy hour and game time!"}
{"text":"Everyone of my cocktails were terrible. I dunno how I managed to spend $40 on 4 drinks? Every surface of this bar is sticky and disgusting. The walls were sticky, the floors, the railings... Good crowd but Awful DJ. Country bar with no country music."}
{"text":"I was at the hotel across the street for a conference, a huge conference with at least 500 people if not more attending. 

But the hotel didn't give this restaurant a heads up that there would be likely a lot of people there for lunch, and there were only 2 guys serving.

Yet those two guys, one of them was named Kelby, came in clutch. They hauled it to try and get service to everyone in the joint. They went above and beyond, as did the third guy who rushed in to help. 

What a fantastic staff who did their best to adapt and succeed under pressure. I had the fried pierogies by the way, and they were absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"The service here was great, we sat at the bar and the bartenders were so attentive, our wait for food and drinks was so quick. I ordered the Italian job hoagie and the bf ordered the kitchen sink hoagie. Both of them were very good. The only thing was I special ordered a side salad because I am very picky, and it didn't come as ordered. When I tried to send it back they said the kitchen was extremely busy so I just got the chips instead. If it wasn't for the salad they would have gotten 5 stars. Also, we didn't have a waitress but some of them seemed distracted like it was social hour and not work time. Would definitely recommend anyone to eat here (sit at the bar) and we will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Food was basic and they charge you for condiments. Our server had a large attitude problem our whole time there(during a steeler game). However the bartenders are very nice and can make a good drink though."}
{"text":"After the owner contacted me about my previous one-star review, I felt it necessary to point out that most of the reasons why this place sucks probably have nothing to do with the management.  Yes, I called the doorman a jackass, which was probably harsh-- I'm sure he's just a perfectly nice guy who has simply become bitter after having to deal with the level of drunk idiots who frequent this place.  I guess he kind of has to assume that everyone is drunk enough that they might potentially attempt something that they will forever regret, so I suppose it makes sense that he assumed the same of me even though I arrived entirely sober.  Also, being that I'm 35 years old, it's fair to say that this just isn't my type of place, and a one-star joint for me might be considered the best bar in history for a 22 year old frat guy who isn't aware of how crappy Pittsburgh really is.  This place sucks because the clientele is made up of people that I generally try to avoid, not because the management is incompetent, which I can't really speak to.  If you are a 21-24 year old male who is forced to reside in Pittsburgh or surrounding areas and your typical Friday night consists of drinking until you throw up and going home with a girl who will only speak to you because she's even more hammered than you are, have at it, loser-- FIVE STARS!!"}
{"text":"I was at this place on Saturday, November 7 with my cousin for a quick snack and drink before we got on the Gateway Clipper at 12:30.
We had a fun day planned and it really started at this place.
First I must commend the two bartenders that were there. Both of them were nice and courteous and my drink was exceptional. I don't remember their names. But one looked like Adam Levine from Maroon 5. He and my cousin didn't see it. But, I totally did.
The interior was nice and inviting and the stools at the bar were very comfortable.
The food I'm not sure if I'm the best person to ask as my cousin and I only got the pepperoni rolls. I will say they were delicious and were great as the small, satisfying snack I was looking for before we hopped on the boat.
In the brief 45 minutes we were there, I enjoyed it immensely and will make my way back there the next time I'm in Station Square.
Thank you for a nice start to a fun day."}
{"text":"Went to this place after the steelers game, only about a 5 minute wait, the atmosphere is alright, typical bar food, steaks, sandwiches, burgers, large variety of drafts; however being a Broncos fan I was treated poorly by staff and those inside the saloon because the steelers won, the bacon on my sandwich was also uncooked, decent place besides my bashings"}
{"text":"we steamrolled through here on our road trip.  we were staying at the sheraton across the street and the concierge suggested we check it out.  good suggestion, because it was ladies night.  it was kind of dead when we first got there.  either it really did fill up, or all the alcohol we had made it seem more full.  we ended up having a really great time- girls dancing on bars, learning the cupid shuffle, stumbling through the electric slide.  we may have been a two man crew, but i think we brought so much party in our pants, the buckhead wouldn't have known what to do with more than two of us."}
{"text":"The staff was fabulous! That's the only nice thing I have to say. The fries had no flavor-come on! Everybody has delicious fries these days. The black bean nachos were exactly as you'd get in a movie theater-just add a few beans and lettuce. The Italian sub wasn't bad-how can you mess that up. 
We expected lots of craft beers-nope. Lots of bottles and only the normal drafts. Perfect location, really cool looking place but I will not be back."}
{"text":"I went here with a group of friends on a Friday night.  It was a lot of what I expected of a bar in Station Square.  We were just there to drink and dance.  I was the DD, so I can't vouch for the drink prices.  There are two separate bars, an upper and a lower, a small stage where we saw a cover band from Atlanta play (they were okay).  Later in the night they were pouring some sort of peach schnapps concoction into the mouths of the ladies who were willing to be on the receiving end and dance up on the stage.  It kind of added to the wild and crazy fun aspect of the place.  Not bad. I'd probably go back, but not before checking out some of the other places in Pittsburgh first."}
{"text":"We ended up here strictly do to the fact that we were staying at the Sheraton across the street.  A more generic booze and grope you will not find.

Actually, during the early evening it wasn't a terrible place to grab a drink before heading across the river.  But after 10, it was time to overcrowd the place with uninteresting people looking to hook up with the world's most generic cover band as the backdrop.

Which, if that's what you're looking for, you could find a place that has something more going for it. The staff was fairly kick ass towards our group, but other than that, there's absolutely no reason to seek this meh joint out."}
{"text":"Great looking bar food was really good i came in from texas sat down at the bar to watch hockey.    Unfortunately sat next to an off duty employee that changed tvs to what he wanted.  He changed the tv right in front of me to what he wanted even though i was watching it.   Made the comment that this is a sports bar but not all sports they can go somewhere else to watch .   Also he ran the music.  Turned off touch tunes i think.    Im here all week with a big group for a convention we wont going here."}
{"text":"Lewis and Maxx provided outstanding service! We didn't have to wait for drinks or service. They provided excellent customer service and were extremely friendly throughout the night. Thanks, Buckhead's! We'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"This is one of the worst experiences that I have ever had at a restaurant. 
 My coworker and I went there to eat on Wednesday evening we order drinks and food. The menu is limited. I got nachos and my coworker had a salad. No where on their menu does it state that their nachos are drenched in a Cajun seasoning.  I have a couple food allergies that I know how to avoid.  One of them being Cayanne pepper which I would have avoided had the menu stated Cajun seasoning.
 Pretty immediately I started to sweat, my lips started to swell, and I started to have a hard time breathing.  My coworker grab a manager to get me water and a Benadryl which they did have but I luckily did not ultimately need.
 After some time I was feeling better and asked for a menu to place an order for something else. I started to eat again but instantly felt ill.  I explained to the manager( long dark hair thin build short in height) that I was just not going to be able to eat after the incident.  When she brought our checks she had charged me for my second order I explained to her that due to the allergic reaction I was unable to eat and she stated that she would not be able to take two items off the bill but only the one they were responsible for.  I paid and exited I will never step foot into this restaurant again and I will make sure everyone is aware of the horrible customer service that I received."}
{"text":"As I expected, Buckhead's exceeded my expectations. For this particular outing, I reserved VIP bottle service for my girlfriends 21st birthday on Friday, November 13, 2015. I had been to Buckheads a couple times over the past couple years, all of which have been an excellent experience as well. But this was the first time I planned VIP. 

Right from the start I had a pleasant experience. Jaime Reott and company were very friendly and easy to talk with when setting up the VIP and bottle service. Thank you to the management staff for making that a very simple process!

What more can you say about the price other than its the best deal in town for birthday specials. Including tip and drink tax, I paid about $170 for a bottle of 3 Olives, private section, our own waitress, and no cover. The birthday girls drink cost a penny from 10-midnight and all well drinks for guests were $3. Add to that a $1 Kamikaze shot, which may now be my girlfriends new favorite shot. The tab (not including bottle service) at the end of the night was about $12 for both her and I. You can not beat that!

 For the life of me, I can not remember our waitresses name, but she did and excellent job. She was nice and attentive to all my guests. I used to be in the restaurant profession so I now how chaotic it can be behind the scenes for her. Thank you to her for making the day special for Courtney!

The DJ was great, music was popping, and the atmosphere was wonderful. Everyone involved did a fantastic job and I will be recommending Buckheads to anyone who asks me. Thanks for making the night special and I can not wait to come back down there soon!

{"text":"Big great food @ reasonable prices! I say share!  I had a turkey sandwich and pizza roles both were good but more than enough food for 2, we had leftovers!"}
{"text":"Buckhead is a good place to start out a bawdy evening working your way up East Carson St.  Not sure why my friends and I tend to start here...and sometimes end here, but the drinks are pretty reasonable and the music is consistently good, and the dance floor is usually jumping.  Waiting in the line to get in can be obnoxious, and I'm not crazy about paying covers, but it's not unreasonable either.  Just understand that you're probably going to run into a lot of youngsters (early 20s) and basics doing shots and celebrating birthdays too."}
{"text":"Food was terrible. We stopped in hungry and wanted to try a restaurant that seemed more local than others in the area. We tried the appetizer sampler and it was deep fried beyond belief. Side salad we ordered was meager and majorly lacking. Cherry on top was the dead fruit fly floating in my beer."}
{"text":"Kill me now. Playdoh flavored pizza and live music so generic you'd find it on the shelf just below Valutime. Okay, a nice selection of martinis and some decent specials now and then.  And buckets of peanuts are nice. The dance floor is awkwardly positioned and the decor is perplexing (hunting themed, I guess). The only reason people don't leave is because the music is so loud you can't hear yourself thinking \"there's got to be something better to do in this town.\""}
{"text":"Always too hardcore.
Leave here blacked out* and bleeding**
Long. Island. Iced. Tea.

{"text":"This place was packed for the Pitt vs State game, the service was great, the bartenders kept checking on us and we're quick to make drinks and friendly."}
{"text":"We were in town for a wedding at the hotel across the street. Wanted to find a nice place to hang out after the reception and continue our celebrating. Our first clue should have been the tool that worked at the door. He was incredibly rude and unwelcoming. Awful smell when you enter the place, bathrooms were dirty and gross. Drinks watered down. So we took our group down the street and had a great time."}
{"text":"Employees are unprofessional and rude. They treat the bar like it's their own private party and I heard them repeatedly insult patrons behind their backs. Not the best layout if you want to dance due to empty tables being scattered all over the bar. Obviously this place is mismanaged and I will not be returning for quite some time."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a drink after a Steelers game and left with a $200 bar tab-how that is possible with $2 miller lites, I do not know.  With all the tables being taken, we slid into the \"cabin\" area and claimed 2 couches and a TV-best find ever, it was like hanging out in our own living room!  The bartender was super cool-he quickly learned the name on our tab, was quick with the drinks, and changed our TV to the channel we wanted.  

The only real negative was that the wings were terrible-overcooked and almost no meat-but the fried pierogis more than made up for it!  These things were awesome, we tried to get a second order but they were all out!  The mozzarella sticks and onion rings were just your average bar apps, but good for 4 drunk football fans.  The music was pretty loud and we couldn't get sound for the games which was a bit of a bummer, but the music was good so were ok with it.  A great place to go and get your drink on."}
{"text":"Don't come in between meal times. Slow service. They're gearing up for dinner but neglecting the guests they have."}
{"text":"I was here on a random Friday afternoon.  It was okay, a different experience than I usually have, but I probably won't come back any time soon.  There were very few people here with us, so the waitress was around to check more frequently than I'm sure she would have if it was during a peak time.  The draft and bottle lists are unimpressive, but it'll get the job done.  They have a pretty decent liquor selection, but I can only image the price here.

I had a few of their nachos off their nachos to share plate and they were a nice, thick chip with some non-descript lettuce, tomatoes, cheese sauce, and a few jalapenos.  There were small sides of salsa and sour cream.  I'm used to a big mess on the plate, but these were actually fairly neat to eat - I almost missed the soggy reject chips that are always left on nacho plates because that means the first ones were the perfect balance of crisp and gooey.  They also ran out of grilled chicken, so we had to substitute chicken tenders.  I'm wondering why, since it was SO packed (read: not at all), they ran out, but it happens.

Redeeming points: Big Buck Hunter.  My boyfriend and his friend selected this place because they have an ongoing competition."}
{"text":"My friends and I find ourselves here every month to unwind from the week. We win some drink specials so we get VIP seating. We usually get there earlier in the night so it isn't as crowded. That changes around 10 or 11PM and the bar becomes a dance club and bar. The drink selections are okay and the waitresses are attentive. Buckhead Saloon is a good bar to go to with your friends to have fun but it isn't anything special."}
{"text":"I must refrain myself from giving this establishment five stars just because I touched, (yes, touched!) a particular football player here. I must question why he was out on a Friday night and he is not playing today cause he needs rest for his sprained ankle....more like he is suffering from a buckhead hangover! I would have gotten my picture taken if it was not for the big scary dude who told me, he doesn't take pictures in bars. Someone just doesn't want 'drink like a champion' pictures appearing again on deadspin.

But, whatever. Decent bar. $2 you call it on Friday nights - at least when I was there and it went until 10:30. The place was packed and the music was Pittsburgh - a good mix of everything and country music included. That's how we roll."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I was too lazy to walk or drive elsewhere when staying at the Sheraton which is about 50 feet away.  What a mistake.  This place is about as generic issue as it gets, complete with all the fake outdoor stuff you might imagine, and the service is very poor.

Aparantely the bartender thought her dinner she was eating at a side table was much more important then serving drinks.  There is very little food selection and it is sub standard bar fare.  I am not sure if all the bars on this street are like this, but I would avoid this one if possible."}
{"text":"you people need to go to burger school

our burgers looked white-probably frozen burgers boiled-gross

the pretzel rolls,beer and the steeler nation were the only good thing about this place"}
{"text":"It was a good start to the visit, place was pretty empty and the bartender came right up to us when we sat down. First, I asked if they had any Ciders and the bartender replied that \"they had Woodchuck and that was probably the closest to a cider they had.\" Keep in mind, Woodchuck is a hard cider based out of Vermont, cider is in its name. It took about 10 mins before the same bartender asked if we wanted to see a menu, and another 10 minutes before someone came back to see if we wanted to place a food order. The other bartender took part of our order, walked away but had to come right back around the corner from the P.O.S. system because he had forgotten part of the order. A few minutes go by and someone finally gets close enough for us to get their attention to place the rest of our order. The first part of our order shows up, fries are cold and my hoagie had tomatoes, which I asked for it not to have, luckily I'm not allergic or anything. Like a previous review, the nachos are smothered in a Cajun seasoning, so much that it makes it hard to eat because it's too much seasoning. As we're eating we had to call out to a bartender to get another drink, even though the wannabe Jersey Shore castmate had stood in front of us but was too busy on his phone to notice the empty bottle sitting on the edge of the bar. When the gentleman we got the attention of to get another drink brought it over, it was set down with force and the empty bottle thrown in the trash before he turned away without saying a word. Like another review said as well, it seems that in between the lunch hour and dinner hour the employees are too busy talking with each other, attempting to flirt, or messing with their phones to pay attention to their customers at the bar. And this was all after we watched a group of elderly woman come in, inquire about lower seating where they were pointed to the couch/lounge areas, but when they said that was too low to eat at and walked out, the gentleman who appeared to possibly be in management walked back to his coworkers and laughed about the group of ladies and made snide comments about their seating not being good enough for them. Overall, it was a horrible experience and I hope I never have to visit this establishment ever again."}
{"text":"Visiting from SoCal, my husband and I really loved this place. Their chicken wings were some of the best we've had. Service was amazing; thank you, Evan. Very clean, no smoking and we'll definitely be back when we return."}
{"text":"We came in from New York for our sons graduation and hosted a celebration at Buckhead saloon at station square. I was so impressed with how accommodating and profession both Jaime and Lewis were to help me plan our party with less than a weeks notice . The food was great and our bartender Max was excellent.  A great time was had by everyone , all I had to do was make a phone call and take the suggestions from Jaime and Lewis. Thank you for a great time!!!"}
{"text":"I went for lunch before I set off on a tour. I chose here because most all other places at Station Square to my knowledge were chains or at least places we have where i come from. This place is huge and looks like it has the potential to be fun later on. I asked about local Pitt beers and the bartender offered up 2 one being IC and the other their draft special of the day, yuengling. I ordered what appeared to be the healthiest two menu items. I got the meatball appetizer and a salad that came with all the veggies grilled on skewers and laid over the greens. A cool presentation idea. There were some very comfy looking couches in little booths along the one wall which looks like a fun place to have table service at night."}
{"text":"Oh Buckhead. I want to like you, I really do. With all your tacky decorations and your $2 Yuengling special. But the thing is, the bands you bring in are so so so awful! Like \"hey, we're from Detroit and we're here to rock you.\" Then they try to play a Train song. I just couldn't take it. The DJ isn't so bad, I enjoy that they play a mix of current music and 90's rap. I never get sad when I hear a little Sir Mix A Lot and Biggie. 

I think the most disturbing thing of all is seeing an old man, and I mean like grandpa at the bar old, pouring shots into young girls mouths. I felt disturbed watching this happen, yet I couldn't look away! Where did this man come from? Who was he associated with? There were so many questions... 

Aside from that, I'm surprised there was such a large crowd in the middle of January on the coldest night of the year. The crowd was VERY mixed! I saw everything from 21st birthday celebrations to Cougars out on the prowl. I'd say if you took the band away I'd be able to rate this a 4 star, but you're gonna have to just settle for 3."}
{"text":"I have enjoyed hamburgers from across the country but this was the worst hamburger I ever had. They only make well-done hamburgers.  The burger was dry and hard like a hockey puck. Ordered sautéed onions.  You couldn't bite into the onion, they were hard and cold.  The top of the roll was flaking off and dry also. Way too expensive for the quality. 

The big screen TV's were projector TV and hard to see because they were too lite.  service was marginal, nothing good at this place"}
{"text":"I remember when Station Square used to be the hot spot for happy hours or any after work gathering. Sadly, that's no longer the case. My friends and I decided to go to Buckheads instead of fighting the foot traffic downtown for Light Up Night. That was a great decision - the place wasn't busy at all. The night was going well, drinks were cheap, music, room to move around. We ordered a plate of Nachos for $5, not complaining about the price, the shredded lettuce was cut like it was meant for a Caesar salad, not a big deal just poor presentation. The taste was 'meh', but not horrible. I went up to the bar and asked to pay for my food since we never had a server, rather just asked a bar tender who was walking by where we should order and told us to tell him what we want and he'd place the order. Nice! Asked the bartender if we could pay for our food, he asked if we had a tab. My response was \"no, not to my knowledge.\" I say that because we never gave our credit card, nor did we give a name so we had nothing that tied us to a bill. I felt saying \"i'd like to pay for nachos\" would be sufficient; however, that was not the case. He was relentless when it came to asking me for my tab information, so obviously it became annoying. He asked me why I was being so rude, when in fact he was. They don't know how i do my job, and i don't know theirs, so I couldn't help him find this tab he spoke of. As you can imagine, I was none too happy when he made a scene at the bar. I asked to speak to a manager, who in turn, decided to only reference my tab. It really was a no win battle for me. So I chose to say, \"that's fine, I'll figure it\" and walked away. This manager and all of his professionalism chose very colorful words to call me as I walked away (F'in B). Suffice to say, my business will go elsewhere. The lack of professionalism was astonishing. My recommendation is to steer clear my friends."}
{"text":"Just a typical bar. Nothing special. The beer selection wasn't overwhelming. The fried pickles were average. They did have  good happy hour specials which is what made us stick around a little longer. Overall, not bad! A decent place to have a cold one."}
