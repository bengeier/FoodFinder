{"text":"I think this is the most underrated lunch spot in central Phoenix.  Authentic  Philly food.  Can get busy at noon, but you can get it to go...."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. Great cheese steaks. Only problem is that the owner cooks the food and hair from is arms always end up in my order. I've been there 3 times and it hasn't failed yet. He's an older fellow. Worth it if he's not there."}
{"text":"I was stoked to find real Philly cheese steak place. They defiantly look the part. But the sandwich, although it was tasty, it didn't have much meat on it!! Especially for $6.59 for a ten incher. I felt like I had eaten a six inch sub with double bread. If I ever come back I guess I'd have to spring for double meat. They did however have \"Tasty Cakes\" just like back East. You can't beet a good \"Butterscotch Krimpet\"!"}
{"text":"Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb. I wish this place was open late. The bread can be the most important part of a philly and this place has a great roll. Try this place."}
{"text":"Food....very good cheesesteak. Price is good for what you're getting.  Ambiance....tight and crowded. I can feel a little claustrophobic when there isn't enough space between me and the next guy. This place made me feel really uncomfortable...extremely tight, no room to breathe. Almost turned around as soon as I stepped in the door.  Staff...very friendly and efficient.  Verdict...take it to go."}
{"text":"Best of Philly in my opinion is hands down the Best Cheese Steak in the Valley.  They build sandwiches to your liking with fresh baked bread, lean steak grilled with olive oil and real American cheese.   Yes the place is small, however the owner has a giant heart. He and his wife have stayed true to form and their passion for cleanliness and quality shines through with every menu item.  My business partner and I have made the pilgrimage to Best of Philly in Phoenix every week from Tempe for six years running.  Best of Philly experimented with a second location in Mesa; however, they sold that store off, so be sure to stick to the real deal and grab a coupon from the website."}
{"text":"Loving my cheesesteak and Best of Philly doesn't disappoint! My friend is from Philly and he loves this place as well.   It's a bit spendy for the quantity you get but the quality makes up for it."}
{"text":"To sum it up: it's delicious cheestesteak with the perfect amount of seasoning. The best I've had in Phoenix, and I've tried quite a few. Best of Philly is a cozy place that you might miss unless you are searching for it, but it's absolutely worth stopping in, saying \"Hi\" to John, and trying out the food."}
{"text":"Decent sandwich here. I like mine extra cheesy and some salt. The bread is delicious and soft so that really makes the sandwich better!"}
{"text":"Best of Philly is the best place to get an authentic cheese steak in Phoenix, Arizona. John, the owner, is a transplant from the East Coast and he knows what he's doing. Get a regular cheese steak, ask for mushrooms, onions, pickles on the side, or try the bomb steak, or even the pizza steak. They're all exceptional, find or create your own favorite! Good french fries, and free refills on drinks. Check out their website at http://www.bestofphillyaz.com for a discount coupon, print it out for you and your friends and enjoy the best lunch in downtown!"}
{"text":"Yay!  Best of Philly is open on Saturdays from 10am to 4pm.  I know where I'm going this Saturday."}
{"text":"I ordered ahead and regret it because the place was not clean. The Philly steak sandwich was not of good quality.  I don't recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"One of only two places in the Phoenix area that can make an excellent Philly Cheesesteak like I get in Philly. Sandwiches are a good size & the price point is reasonable"}
{"text":"I like this place. A group of us decided to try it out for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. The man behind the counter was very helpful and patient with us. I had the Philly with onions and mushrooms. I loved the White American cheese. I am not from Philly and have not had many cheesesteaks, so I am not even close to an expert on the topic, but i liked what i was eating. The iced tea was good, which is becoming very hard to find.  They messed up one of our orders and made a new sandwich and also wrapped up the \"mistake\" for us to take with us."}
{"text":"What are disappointments thought this place would be great considering the name is best of Philly for $9 you get all bread very little meat couple slices of cheese and a couple peppers Brad was very soft no flavor Arby's could do a job people working there seem miserable no smiling faces guy taking order was very short think he got mad because I didn't want fries or a drink but whatever definitely won't go back"}
{"text":"Best cheesesteak west of Philly. Friendly owners and if you go here more than once the odds are they will remember you and your order. From the outside it doesn't look like anything great but they don't serve frozen chop steak like most places. Great food at a reasonable price. And always get double steak double cheese!!"}
{"text":"cheese steak was ok but pastrami sandwich had exactly 6 very thin slices of meat  and alot of bread  better deal across the sreet at subway  for 5 bucks tastee cakes and wise chips only reason it got 2 stars"}
{"text":"This family business has been around for 24 years. Great Philly cheese steak sub! Super fast service during lunch hour. They knock it out with three employees, and a owner manager. Very efficient operation. Cheap prices too. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I'm visiting from LA, so this was the first time I have eaten at Best Of Philly. I will for sure eat there next trip! The Gyros was amazing! And the mushroom steak sub was too die for! Thanks to the nice people working, I think it was the owner and maybe his wife."}
{"text":"There is nothing good about this place.  I am guessing most people that come here have never had a real philly.  This philly is a meat sandwich.  Nothing traditional about the Philly here, wrong cheese, wrong bread wrong everything  The fries were under cooked too.  Simply flavorless.  Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to check this place out for SOOOO long, just never got the chance. I wanted a warm meal, so I decided to go get me a cheesesteak. I went with the regular cheese steak and had them add grilled onions, mushrooms and sweet peppers. It was around $7.50 with the added veggies. It was pretty good, but the meat was underseasoned and there wasn't enough for the size of the roll (10 inch) I needed more onions than they gave me, but it was still a decent cheesesteak. I'll go back if I\"m looking for a middle of the road cheesesteak,, but am sadly still on the hunt for the totally awesome cheesesteak here in the desert"}
{"text":"I've never actually been here (always had someone go and get it) and the only thing I can rate are their cheesesteaks because that is all I have ever had.  Based on that alone, it gets 5.  It is the most authentic cheesesteak that I have had in the PHX.  Shredded steak, melted cheese THROUGHOUT, not just shredded steak on a slice of cheese, and the bread, oh the bread.  That's all.  No cheese whiz, no lettuce, tomato, peppers ... just cheese and steak.  And it's heaven."}
{"text":"Love this place, I've been coming for years and the same family has been here since I can remember which means their food is just as good today. Cheese steaks are great and make sure you get the grilled peppers!"}
{"text":"Cool little place. Very efficient and quick service. Had half a cheese steak and fries. Only thing I wanted more of was cheese. I'm sure that had I asked for more I'd have given this 5 stars."}
{"text":"Had the Italian and fries. Food was real good, had to wait a bit but it was lunch time, sat outside and enjoyed the sunshine. Very nice employees."}
{"text":"I am an East coast native and all I can say is WOW! I had a chicken Philly, chunks of white meat with fresh peppers, onions and mushrooms.   For those in the \"know,\" they offer both provolone or Whiz."}
{"text":"I had never been a fan of philly cheese steaks but this place really changed that! I've been here 3 times and every time the service was good and the food was great. The first time I felt it was a little dry and didn't have enough cheese, but the second and third time simply asking for extra cheese fixed that (maybe I just prefer more cheese). Great place for a quick cheese steak!"}
{"text":"why has it been so long since I have been here? this place is great!! I've been to Philly and this is the closest thing you'll find anywhere! I just wish they had bigger napkins!"}
{"text":"Odd people, odd hours, inconsistent food. I had a really great Philly cheese steak sandwich here once but then every time after that has been less and less appetizing. The last time I went here, my chicken was undercooked and the lettuce tasted like chemicals. I don't quite understand it, but you'd best go next door to Honey Bear's if you know what's good for you."}
{"text":"I can recommend the chicken cheese steak - very tasty and filling. Onions, good bread, chicken, and cheese sauce -- and it doesn't fall apart.  It could use more chicken for the price, but still good. Note that it's very tiny inside - be prepared to squeeze through. They sell Tastykakes at the register, which makes sense, since the company is located in Pittsburgh. http://www.tastykake.com/aboutus/"}
{"text":"Often overlooked,  this place is a treasure hiding in plain sight. The space inside is tiny, but that's exactly what makes this place special. You might be tempted to get a Philly sub, the staple serving of this location, but I'd suggest trying the Gyros. Welcome to midtown!"}
{"text":"Ordered the 10\" bomb.  It came with cheese, peppers, onions, and steak.  I thought the bread was sub par.  I found it a bit too tough to chew through.  The steak tasted good.  Had a nice juice to it and was tender enough.  I wish they put enough of it to fill the bun.  The toppings also were a bit on the light side.  If you are going to charge 7 bucks for a cheesesteak you should be generous with the toppings.  This place has been here forever so it's not going anywhere.  Personally, there are too many other spots in the area for me to return.  I am still looking for that go to cheesesteak spot and the search continues..."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time. They definitely know how to make an amazing philly cheese steak! Highly recommend it along side with the onion rings perfectly made and we'll worth it together. Thank you Best of Philly you guys made my day! Definitely will be back again!!!"}
{"text":"Ehhhh not good and not bad. Very underwhelmed... The empty parking lot should have been a sign. Steak sandwich was bland but the bread was good."}
{"text":"Review is 3.5 stars, I enjoyed my cheese steak when I visited Best of Philly.  It was a Wednesday lunch time and the place was quite busy, I ordered the combo deal with half sandwich, fries, and a pop.  I was offered onions, mushrooms, sweet, and hot peppers.  I declined the sweet peppers. I sat down to eat and I thought the sandwich was tasty with good poofy bread, though devoid of mushrooms.  I noticed two slivers of onion and there was a good helping of tangy yellow peppers on top, I wouldn't call them 'hot' by any means.  There were several orders up at the same time as mine, I think someone else maybe grabbed my sandwich by accident. So, all in all a good experience and I would return.  I've never been to Philadelphia to try the 'real' thing maybe that'll be my next foodie vacation!"}
{"text":"I've been coming for cheese steaks for a while now and wanted to write a review after my last visit.  I think this place has the best cheese steaks in the valley.  When I get a craving for a cheese steak, I make the drive here from Laveen.  The staff has always been friendly and the place is always clean.  I recommend you check this place out if you're in the mood for a cheese steak."}
{"text":"If you want a quick sandwich - this place is OK. It's tiny inside but there is outdoor seating. The place was clean, bright and the people were friendly. The sandwich I had was the, \"Bomb Steak.\" It was filling but nothing to write home about. I would stop by again if I was in the area and wanted something quick."}
{"text":"Nice little mom and pop place in the heart of central Phoenix.  The cheese steaks are good and you can modify them to whatever you want.  I got the combo which was a half cheese steak, fries, and a drink for less than $10.  The half sandwiches are pretty big.  They have free refills on the sodas, easy parking, and the place is clean.  It's a really good option if you want to stop in for something quick, inexpensive, fresh, and tasty."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite place ever. I go out of my way to get their cheesesteaks any time I am in Phoenix. Soooooo good. I've been coming here for about 15 years. Same great cheesesteaks every time. Same great people running it. Really nice people."}
{"text":"Great food and the owner is so personable.  You don't find that often.  I'll be going back there to try more than the amazing Philly cheese steak I had today"}
{"text":"Very average philly. Not expensive, quick little take out place. Not the best but not the worst. Wish it had a little more meat in it. Prob would not go back again because there is lots of places to pick from in this area."}
{"text":"When you are looking for the best Philly in Phoenix, look no further; this is the place.  The sandwich almost melts in your mouth... holy cow! It was delicious.  The fries are just your standard run of the mill fries, or they would have gotten 5 stars."}
{"text":"I driven by this place a few times, saying to myself, I gotta try it! I finally had the opportunity to & i was brutally disappointed!    I went during the lunch hour. Had an OK crowd inside. On the menu Board, it says \"try it, you'll love it\" So i did. I paid almost $7.00 for my steak sandwich. It didn't take that long to cook. (that part I was impressed.) When I got my sandwich, it was a skinny little thing. I took my first bite & the sweet peppers were cold. I usually like to eat the whole sandwich, but I had to leave pieces of bread behind because they were, just that, bread!  I've had steak sandwiches before (in philly) & they are soooo good. Nothing compares to it! but if your craving one, don't come here. Go to the other place that starts with a \"C\""}
{"text":"Drove a long way to try this and sadly not impressed! It was not bad just not great, hardly any cheese on it! If in the area may have again but NO special trips there! Had a philly at Freddy's a day or so ago and it was much better!"}
{"text":"I love the cheesesteak! It's chopped up nice with some nice cheese in it on a nice bun. I've had cheesesteaks from other places in Phoenix and in my opinion this is my favorite place for cheesesteaks. I had a another cheesesteak here today and it's so good.  It's a small place and very busy at lunch time. But that as show others that the local people are willing to stand in line to get a cheesesteak. They don't have Pepsi they have Coke products so I had orange soda."}
{"text":"I have driven by this place on Central Avenue for years and never stopped in.  Decided today to grab a quick lunch and was pleasantly surprised...the cheeseteak was quite good, but disappointed they don't make them with whiz, the fries were decent and I love that they sell Tastycakes...yummy!  The staff was very friendly and the few tables fill up quickly, so beware of what time you come if you want to eat there."}
{"text":"I wish I would have tried this place sooner!  My husband had only tried it once while working downtown and had never mentioned it to me.  That was until, I was sick of the usual and suggested we stop downtown on the way to Chandler.    I ordered a regular Cheese Steak with onions (banana peppers on the side).  It was incredibly juicy, flavorful, and beyond delicious!  I scarfed it down and wanted more.  In fact, a week later, I went back for another b/c I could not stop thinking about how good it really was.  But this time, we went during lunch hour on a weekday and it was so busy that I didn't get as much meat...so it wasn't as good as the first time.  I will be back though, just not on a busy weekday.  I loved that they also sold east coast desserts (TastyCakes, which I had never had and liked) and chips.  The service was very good, on my first visit and even during lunch hour."}
{"text":"Having best of philly right next to work is not good  not as good as fore father's in Twmpe but they're still sooo good and I love seeing the owners working hard!"}
{"text":"Best Philly cheesesteak in town bar none! The Bomb is amazing and on days I want to keep it simple I order a philly with mushrooms and mayo and it's still great. The gyros are a great choice too, my nephews love them with French fries. The service is quick and efficient and being a local family owned business they recognize you and already know what you're going to order!"}
{"text":"Hits the spot! You know when the place is packet waiting for their ordered it is one of two things, for this place they are so good that staff can't get them out fast enough. The wait was not even that long, as it has taken longer to get a sub than this piping hot cheese and sweet peppers sandwich. Worth a try trip if you are in the area."}
{"text":"O.K. so I went to my first Overeaters Anonymous meeting on Monday....  no joke. So before I do that deal I'm saying goodbye to my favorite Phoenix delicacies.   This Place --ohhh.   It's sex. It's total sex.   Sometimes sex is nice. It's fun, it doesn't hurt, it's familiar.   Not here.   It's like the shy unassuming person you never really thought of doin' it with before.  It's been in the neighborhood forever, you never really hear about how awesome it is, it doesn't look like much from the inside or outside. It kind of looks like an old school adobe Taco Bell.   So, never really having had a good Philly Cheesesteak sandwhich, I wasn't sure what to expect.   The Menu is pretty simple. 8 different cheesesteaks, gyros, subs, fries, onion rings, tasty cakes, salads, burgers.   Well duh, I'll get a cheesesteak.   The cheesesteaks are 10 inches.   Even after I saw that, I was thinking,\"I can take this\". I ordered a half mushroom one, a half pizza one. Thinking I could take 5 inches at a time, and save some for later.   So I began taking it.   This shy unassuming restaurant began showing how truly Freaky DeeKay it was.   The first bite was mind blowing, amazing, opening up whole new vistas of experience. I never knew it could be this good. The steak is chopped on the grill with olive oil, and then covered in white american cheese. The mushroom added the best mushrooms I have ever had on a sandwhich. The pizza side added really well done pizza sauce.   That first bite ohhh.   Then thats where it got nasty, and rough.  It's too much! I thought I was tough, I thought I could take it- but this is fried red meat covered in fatty cheese encased in delicious carb centric white italian bread.  That first bite was amazing, but I wasn't sure this was for me. I was worried about the damage to my body. I didn't know if my heart could take it.  The sandwhich looked at me as if to say \"want me to stop?\". I considered that this was rough, this was new- but my 10 inch big boy was such a demonstration of mastery and experience, I couldn't stop. I NEEDED more.  So as I was abandoning myself to the experience I realized this was just on the brink of gross enough to be nasty and carnal, and refined enough to be a truly unique experience. There was no fatty pieces in the meat. It wasn't too hard and tough. It's astuteness tempered itself by being soft and delicate.  There were moments where I thought 'Oh my god, I have to stop, I think I might die!\" but I couldn't. I so couldn't.  This in not something I can handle every day. This sandwhich made me want to eat salads for the rest of the week. Not because I feel dirty or guilty, simply because I know taking this thing pushed the physical limits of my body.   Too many of these and I could easily see myself crying in  shame and lamenting  \"what man would want me now\"?"}
{"text":"I was heartbroken on my last visit.  Rather than increase the price (which I would not have minded), They are now using frozen, generic steak patties instead of the fresh sliced prime rib.  I didn't see any of the novelty items (ie.. TastyCakes) and I think they fired their cook as the owner was manning the grill.  Too sad!"}
{"text":"For me this is the best cheesesteak place in the Phoenix area. I'm originally from Boston, and this place would be about 2.5 stars there, but it gets four here in Phoenix for at least doing it the right way. My negative is they skimp on the meat. As others have said, they are a bit thin. At least you can get double meat, but at a cost."}
{"text":"My BF swears by this place. He says its the closest he's had to the cheesesteaks in Philly. Well I've never been to Philly and if their famous cheesesteaks are like these, than I'll have to past. Don't get me wrong, they taste good but I've definitely had way better. I am a huge fan of cheesesteaks and I've had my fair share of cheesesteaks in my lifetime to make that judgement."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today 3/2/13.  Business hours posted said they closed at 4PM on Saturday's.  Then why the hell were they close at 350PM ?  I will never visit this establisment again."}
{"text":"Just came by here for the first time after hearing great things about all of their food. I ordered the Greek salad to go-which sounded really good and added chicken.. when I opened it, it was cucumbers, tomatoes, and some seasoned chicken. Sorry,  but not at all what I ordered and not worth the $10.00.  I won't be back. How hard is it to throw on the olives, cheese, peppers, oh yea.. and dressing that I ordered?"}
{"text":"One of the best cheese steaks in the valley!  Can't wait to go back.  We tried to but they were closed for the day :-(  Their hours vary quite a bit by the day of the week (they cater mostly to the weekday lunch crowd) so if you are going on the weekend then check the hours.  Some of their other offerings look good too, but I'm not sure I'd try them....I'm just there for the cheese steak and that is all....yum!"}
{"text":"Not Bad  I decided to visit Best of Philly based on TripAdvisor reviews. Looking at the outside of \"Best of Philly\" you wouldn't think much the Best of Philly is small and unassuming.  The restaurant is small with a few tables inside and additional tables on the outside patio area.  On the this visit we ordered a philly steak sandwich, fries, and salad. We were served quickly, it took less than 5 minutes to receive our food. The Philly steak sandwich was just ok.  The meat was flavorful although it lacked cheese and the bread was fresh, crispy, and hot.  The Philly was not bad however nothing really stood out. It was just an average Philly Sandwich.   The service at Best of Philly is good.  The staff is welcoming and accommodat ing. I would recommend Best of Philly for a quick bite at wallet friendly price."}
{"text":"It's time to update your online menu. The price of your cheesesteaks has gone up by 38% since you posted your menu."}
{"text":"I know \"Yelpers\" are leary of 5star reviews, but if its due its due! First off this is not your \"Philadelphia\" philly steak, but we are not in Philadelphia we are in Phoenix! Second of all, only thing that should matter is taste, and amazing taste is what you get here... There steak sandwich, with onions and peppers and white Aemerican cheese (was Very leary of the American instead of Provolone but it works) is a perfect blend of flavors.. The mixture and the way they create it melds together so well, I was speechless after my first bite! Dont go here looking for your \"wiz with or wiz without\" Just go here with an \"open mind\" and good flavors await you... Believe That!!! In addition the \"Italian Sub\" with boars head meat and provolone ;)  was superb.. They dont rob you of the meat, nice fresh meaty subs! Oh and dont forget the \"Tasty Cakes\" original coffee cake cupcakes! I know someone out there can relate yum yum, goooooood!!! Just give this place a try, with an open honest mind.. You will enjoy the wonderful owners and food...Bet That!"}
{"text":"As always food quick to be serve. Hot fresh yummy. Seemed a little overpriced for two sandwiches nearly $20 guess I should've kept the receipt."}
{"text":"Really good cheese steak. Had the bomb steak sandwich, exellent flavor... Just wish it was a little bigger. Friendly counter service."}
{"text":"Great Philly Cheesesteaks, and quick service. The seating area is lacking unless you eat outside but I definitely would go back"}
{"text":"All in all it was ok. The bread was the best part. The sandwhich was good just over priced for the volume of meat. Read Jack N's review. Here it is.   The steak tasted good.  Had a nice juice to it and was tender enough.  I wish they put enough of it to fill the bun.  The toppings also were a bit on the light side.  If you are going to charge 7 bucks for a cheesesteak you should be generous with the toppings."}
{"text":"First off I have to say, I moved here from Chicago... I know, most of us have but anyway. This place makes me feel right at home, the owner always knows who you are and greets you just like you would expect to be greeted in a friendly family owned business and it makes you want to come back all the time.  Now for the food, this is one of those I gotta have once a week type places. My mouth waters just thinking about it. The hard part for me is trying to choose between the Jalapeno cheese steak or the pizza cheese steak. The good news for me is I always come with a friend so I usually get to have half of both, I went with a friend once that didn't like my choices in these two so I found a new friend. So find a good Friend to come here with and and your day will be amazing like always is when I visit this establishment!"}
{"text":"Tried it today with my hubby for lunch. I got the 1/2 cheesesteak combo and my hubby got the plain steak with bacon. We both loved it! We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Too bad. When they were on Indian School years ago you could count on getting a bomb sandwich at a good price. I always have gotten the Bomb steak. It was LOADED and falling out of the roll. I recently began working a block from them and returned for lunch. I ordered the Bomb.  Very disappointing for an $9 sandwich. It was 2/3 roll and 1/3 filling. Maybe 2 ounces of actual steak and minuscule amounts of filling including peppers, mushrooms onions and cheese. It was not \"the bomb\". Though it tasted good, it was like an appetizer, unless you actually like your steak and cheese with extra bread. No thanks. I'll spend my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Yes this is a very small place but a very good mom and pop place. I had the of course Philly cheese steak. It did take a little bit over five minutes to get our order and we ate it at the place but it was all worth it and tasted very fresh and very good."}
{"text":"Had been by this place several times; finally stopped by on the recommendation of uber driver. Tiny place makes an excellent cheese steak!"}
{"text":"I ate here for lunch yesterday, had a cheesesteak, fries and large coke, cost me around $10.   It was a GOOD meal, nothing spectacular.  While not at the top of my list, I would eat there again."}
{"text":"I'm from Philly, which of course nothing in Az can compare to a real cheese steak. I've visited this place a couple times, and  as the saying goes,  third time was  a charm(not exactly). The guy in the kitchen was rude to me when i tried to grab a few ketchup packets and napkins near the register.I honestly never sat down and ate in there, which I didn't know napkins and ketchup were on the tables. What made my visit worse was that a gentlemen behind me in line did exactly the same thing,and   nothing was said to him.I felt like the kitchen guy was border line yelling at me as if I was going to steal all the napkins and ketchup packets from the  other paying customers... who would do such a thing??? lol. Anyways, my cheese steak was nothing special, which I was hoping it would be on my third visit.And the way i was treated was unnecessary."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't reviewed Best of Philly yet... I've been coming here for ten years now and the food is always consistent, tasty and cheap.  Yes, the cheesesteaks are delicious, but you HAVE to try their gyros. AMAZING. Just remember your number if you call in for takeout...they don't take your name. Bombsteak!"}
{"text":"Being from the east coast I have a high standard for my Philly Cheesesteaks.. And let me just say that Best of Philly definitely lived up to it's name.  Loaded hoagies, extremely fast service and a bounty of options to choose from? I'll take it.   Definitely will be recommending this place!! Will certainly be making a return visit! A+++"}
{"text":"I've been having a 'life goal momentary deterred' type of morning (I was turned down admittance yet again!), and in cases like this, I go and find the greasiest food I possibly can to make my stomach ulcer, that I'm pretty sure I have, way worst off than what it already is.   Today, I ventured off campus for a bit and found this place to do said damage. Sadly, I was kind of disappointed with my hoagie (just with the lettuce and tomatoes) and side of fries. The hoagie wasn't pipping hot enough and the fries...like half of them were just how I like them, and the other half were kinda soggy, how you manage to do that I know not. Maybe not the best meal for a hot day like this, however the damage has already been done.   I give this place at least 3 stars for it being close enough to class, a filling meal and doing what I went there for in the first place, to make myself feel even more miserable. It def did the trick! Now I wish I had got ice cream as well."}
{"text":"If you don't eat here at least once in your life, you'd be missing the best philly cheese steak.  They take pride in this little shop. So clean and tidy! Yummy food and the owners are fun and friendly. If I'm ever back in AZ I'll travel out of my way to eat here again."}
{"text":"Guy knocked me over the head and drug me here caveman-style to get a Philly Steak craving he'd been having out of his system.  He ordered his with onions and bell pepper and two-times extra cheese.  The steak was flavorful, bread was chewy, veggies done just right.   The white american cheese, however, especially when doubled, was like Elmer's Glue on a sandwich. It ruined it for me (not a cheese lover), but my guy sat there munching with a starry-eyed look on his face chewing through all that cheese.  I asked him how it was; he nodded, likely unable to speak due to cheese mouth glue syndrome. To each his own.  My gyro was delightful, one of the finest I've had.   Took away one star for how cramped it is inside. They even encourage you to share tables with strangers."}
{"text":"I am not huge fan of Philly steak, since I haven't found places around the valley offers that authentic taste.  Friend of my suggested try this place, since he knows the owner.  So, I gave it a try...  MAN!! First bite exploded in my mouth!! Never thought Philly steak could be this good!!  Meat is so soft and tender, and flavors are WOW!  Owner says, he only uses fresh and high quality meat..  I can tell!!  I highly recommend this place!!  Try it! You won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had the pleasure of enjoying the Large Philly Steak is fairly lean and tender, thinly sliced, griddle fried with olive oil, splashed with onions and topped with a solid amount of tasty melted white American cheese in a 10\" Italian Bread roll along with an order of crunchy and tasty French fries.  Touted as the best in Arizona, and although enjoyably tasty and fresh, in my opinion (for what it's worth) it comes just slightly short of what one would call a true Philly! The diner-like eatery is clean, nicely arranged with both indoor and outdoor seating, as well as great personal attention, allowing for a comfortable and gratifying quick lunch.  As one to have had Phillies from across the country, including its hometown of Philadelphia, and can understand variations on the Philly theme, I tend to be a traditionalist in the sense that if a Philly Cheese Steak is not traditionally prepared, it should be called a 'Philly-Style' Cheese Steak!  I rationalize this statement under the same pretense just as I have reviewed and written about the traditional 'Cuban Sandwich'.  Despite Best of Philly's derivation, it is, within reason, a very, very good sandwich.  Regrettably, nowhere on their menu do they offer the 'real' thing which undoubtedly would include the deli roast beef of rib eye or occasionally top round steak griddled and chopped into virgin olive oil, afforded melted provolone cheese, with preferences like of pepper, sautéed onions, mayo, mushrooms, maybe some hot sauce, along with salt, pepper, and/or ketchup, and it would be too costly to fly in the bread from PA... don't get me wrong though, we're not in Philly and this is the closest to a real Philly I've run across in Phoenix - keep it up guys, we'll be back for more.  Bon appétit!"}
{"text":"Pretty good Cheese Steaks. Special of 1/2 sandwich w/ fries and a drink for $6.85 and it's a fountain soda so it's all you can drink ftw!  Only negitive is the hours: 9am-4pm"}
{"text":"If I could give this restaurant 10 stars, I would. I walked in this afternoon with my husband, just to grab a menu to take home and ended up leaving with the best philly sandwich we had ever had. The cook (and owner), John was so pleasant to speak to and whipped up a sandwich for us at a rapid pace. We have never been so satisfied with ones food and customer service. Now that we live in the neighborhood, we will be return customers as often as we can! Thanks for being such an upstanding chef and owner John!"}
{"text":"hadnt gotten a chance to get in here until now, this place is only open until 3pm, weekdays only.   good prices, fast service, solid sandwich, bread was perfect balance of soft vs sturdy enough to not fall apart. no complaints here!"}
{"text":"Steak+Cheese+Bread=YUM  There aren't a lot of places in cen pho to grab a cheese steak and luckily they pack a good one! You can get a 10\" for $6.29 and there is a chicken option if you like. There's a regular, works, bbq, and pizza variation as well.  Also offered: gyros, burgers, fries, onion rings, subs, vegetarian sandwiches, and salads, as well as party sized subs.  Too bad this place is only open Mon-Sat and closes by 4!"}
{"text":"Got the gyro. It was good but very sloppy. Salad had huge pieces of lettuce. Next time I go I  not mess around and get the Philly. Bathrooms are behind building outside. I will review when I get a Philly."}
{"text":"First time here!  Super friendly, clean, and the cheesesteak sand which was delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Bomb Steak with fries and a drink. This always hits the spot."}
{"text":"I got the chicken tenders and they were awful. They tasted like the chicken patties you get in a school lunch. The French fries were soggy. The Philly was average but needed more meat. I do not plan on coming back."}
{"text":"Some of the best philly cheese steaks in az frendly staff and for a good price for my first time here I would definitely comeback."}
{"text":"We have eaten here 3-4 times a month. Friendly owners who remember your name and order. The food is amazing! Being originally from the East Coast it is hard to find cheese steaks like the ones from Philly. These are the best cheese steaks in town. It reminds me of home. Delicious food, friendly staff....highly recommended."}
{"text":"Best of Philly is a barebones purveyor of cheese steaks. There are a few other options on the menu, such as burgers, salads, and wings, but why go to the Best of Philly for anything other than a Philly cheese steak. There isn't much seating inside. More seating is available outside next to Central Ave. Most of my group had the Bomb Steak. I had the cheese steak at the bottom of the menu with avocado and sour cream. I don't see it listed on the menu online and can't remember what it was called. General consensus held that the bread was thick and the sandwiches could of use a little more meat. Otherwise, everyone was happy with their orders. The onion rings and fries were your standard onion rings and fries."}
{"text":"FABULOUS !  When i lived in Phx i craved a cheese steak having had some of the best this one is great  . This area is a mixed bag of nuts & NEVER thought I would find this winner in the SW. I miss this area if i ever get back I will be getting a cheesesteak from here ."}
{"text":"I have literally had a better cheesesteak and fries from more than one college cafeteria.   Have fun biting into (admittedly good) bread half the time while the meager portion of steak crumbles fly out everywhere. The absolutely plain fries aren't going to save you from disappointment. I ordered the \"bomb steak\" which is unique in that it for some reason uses pickled peppers.  And regarding this beef...it's cool that you're chopping it up, but annoying that no one meal preps, and as a result all you hear is the clanging of a metal spatula on the grill over all other activity for the entirety of your meal. You can take it easy, as all that pulverizing completely kills the texture. This is probably an exaggeration, but they might be able to replace it with ground beef, and no one will be the wiser.   Other than that, I do appreciate the charm of this place. The brick walls and cozy design tell you it's one of the older buildings in midtown. The ubiquitous coca cola ads--on the table, the umbrellas over the outdoor seating, etc.--take me back to a time in which being mainstream and average was a-ok. Times have changed, but this place clearly has not. And I respect that. I hope it continues for 20 more. It'll probably do so just fine without my business, which it is unlikely to receive again."}
{"text":"The only authentic Philly Cheesesteak I've found in the Phoenix area! Was born and raised just outside of Philadelphia, and miss the cheesesteaks and Butterscotch Krimpetts the most.  The hoagie roll is excellent. Soft and chewy like it should be. The steak is sliced super thin, cooked with the onions on a flat grill. They add the american cheese to the meat just before pulling the meat from the grill. I like it with a little marinara, and their sauce isn't to thick or sweet. The only thing they are missimg is hot cherry pepper relish. But they do have sliced banna peppers, wich go well on the steak. Top it off with some Wise brand chips and a pack of Tastykakes, and you have the perfect Philadelphia lunch!  The owner and his staff are awesome, always friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Bread, Tastykakes & wise chips.. Perfect taste, just a little light on the steak.. Barely enough to cover inside the roll. Very good, but not \"Philly's Best\". ;)"}
{"text":"I've had the cheese steak, gyro and the chicken tenders and all have been very good.   As you can imagine, this place is not really health but every once in a while you need a gut-bomb."}
{"text":"Been a while since I glowingly reviewed this gem of a place. I used to get there monthly, now only able to once every 4-6 mos. When I was in yesterday, they treated me like they see me every day. I think their house hoagie rolls are even better than previous, the quality/value is unquestioned, and the proprietors are hard working folks who are always there. Oh, KT had the Steak Salad this time and even the greens are excellent! Can't recommend them highly enough."}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken pita. What I got was a soggy, greasy, circle of dough that turned to paste when you touched it.  The chicken was precooked and reheated on a flat grill , so when you get it , it's dry and over cooked.  The whole thing is incredibly bland and flavorless. It was not at all enjoyable.   I would have rather saved the $6 and gone to the sandwich shop down the street."}
{"text":"Amazing!! Taste like I was in Philadelphia. The bread was amazingly soft. The steak was cooked just right. Best Philly steak in town hands down. Great prices. Wonderful service."}
{"text":"Had never been here before, figured I'd give it a try since its close to work. The location is small, so get it to go, but the food is really good. All 3 of us had different sandwiches, and all were outstanding. Will definitely eat here again!  There are a lot of restaurants within a block of this place, and I've been to all of them. Despite the lack of ambiance and decor, the price is very reasonable and the food is the best of all of them. Eat here, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Hours are the only negative part about this joint. Food is damn good and will keep you coming back for more. Get the full subs tho, the half's are really tiny."}
{"text":"Boy this place is annoying.  Every time I go by, they are closed.  They are open ONLY for the midtown lunch crowd and that is it.  We finally got a chance to go during our Xmas break and boy was it good.  I ordered the Bomb Steak which included peppers, onions, cheese, and a lot of meat.  No cheese wiz (too bad) but good white american cheese and a great piece of bread really makes this one of the best phillies in town.  My only complaint is that this place is just so small.  There is so little room to eat or even stand.  They would benefit from a walk-up window for to-go orders."}
{"text":"I had lunch here last week for the first time in many years. It's only open for lunch and offers indoor and outdoor seating. I believe there is more outdoor seating than indoor as this is a small restaurant. I ordered the requisite Philly cheesesteak but the 1/2 size rather than a whole. I also added French fries and a drink. The food was ready in about 5 minutes. I thought the cheesesteak was very good. The beef and cheese were gooey in a good way and the good bun held it all together (3.5).  The fries were good too (3).   Since this was my first visit in a long time I am going to give an overall score of a 3. Perhaps if I ate here more often I could increase the score to a 4. Even though I am giving a 3, I believe this is a good place to eat and would be happy to return when I am in the area."}
{"text":"Tiny little joint - yes, joint is the proper and respectful name. Really tasty Philly cheese steak and onion rings at reasonable prices. The owner/manager is really friendly and the service is fast."}
{"text":"Cheesesteaks are some of the best in town. Grew up in South Jersey & I like the white American cheese & rolls. I come here all the time. Little hole in the wall shop."}
{"text":"So bummed I moved out to the west side of town. But when I go east, I make sure to have a hungry belly for the cheesestakes!"}
{"text":"I went here a couple weeks ago and was pleased with my cheese steak. I had it then with just the meat and cheese. Today when I returned, the guy at the counter asks, \"With onions and mushrooms?\" Okay, yeah. \"Sweet or spicy peppers?\" Spicy, please. And what I received knocked the socks off that earlier sandwich.   This place is tiny, cramped, a bit chaotic and is apparently cooled by wall-mounted fans. Yet I can see myself going here on a regular basis. So, the next time you're having one of those moments, like Ameerah A, opt for the cheese steak. Just be sure to let me know before hand so we can meet up."}
{"text":"My favorite place for cheese steak. Been coming here for years. It is truly a mom and pop place so I love giving back to local versus paying a national franchise."}
{"text":"We finally made it to Best of Philly since we were on winter break and could actually make it in here before they closed!  Little did we know they are actually open on Saturdays.  Oops!  We drive down Central everyday on our way home from work and we have been slowly trying all the restaurants we see.  We're almost done too!    Best of Philly is a teeny tiny little place that packs a big punch in terms of flavor.  I ordered a simple cheesesteak with nothing on it and I was very pleased.  The bread was fantastic!  It was soft and chewy with just a slight crisp on the exterior.  It definitely tasted like fresh baked bread.  The steak was thin and yummy, but I like mine a little saltier, a la Charley's.  The cheese was ooey gooey and the perfect thing to bring everything all together,  I would like to come back, maybe on a Saturday and get a cheesesteak with mushrooms.  A rogue mushroom found it's way into my cheesesteak and it was awesome!  Now I gotta see what it would be like with a whole bunch of them!"}
{"text":"Super delicious!! Very good, great philly cheesesteak. I ordered the jalapeno steak with cheese & it was absolutely to die for!!! I will definitely be back & telling others about this place! Super delicious!! Great atmosphere!!"}
