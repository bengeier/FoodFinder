{"text":"Cheese steaks are pretty good,  but omg the sweet and tangy wings I need them in my mouth!"}
{"text":"horrible service.  they told me our order was going to be late (the quoted me 15 minutes).  fair enough.  we waited about 40 minutes for our order to show up.  i won't even get in to the food quality as it didn't make up for the wait.  they did however give us a $5 coupon for the next time.  then i looked closer....$5 off a $30 purchase!  never again..."}
{"text":"Owner is very rude to say the least I'll never eat there again. Also food is not good enough to be considered to be a restaurant it should be fast food like a more expensive  McDonald's. Wish I didn't have to put any stars!"}
{"text":"The food was very good and the people working there were very friendly. The only negative was the overwhelming cigar smell.  There is a cigar shop about 3 units down. There must be a ventilation issue of some kind. I'm sure they will get it fixed eventually"}
{"text":"It's interesting how different their food is depending on where/when you eat it.

I usually get the Italian sub, and while it's great if you eat at the restaurant, it's a very wet sandwich and doesn't travel well.  It's not great if you get it to go and let it sit more than 10 minutes before eating it.  It's soggy and downright bad if you get it delivered.

The buffalo wings are pretty good with a nice kick of heat.  The french fries are crunchy and salty - pretty darn tasty.

As other reviewers have mentioned, the prices are a bit higher than other sub places, but if you get a coupon in the mail or from a previous order, you can save a few bucks."}
{"text":"We tried this place twice and hated it! The prices are ridiculous and there was no meat in the sandwich. I hated the cheese and the meat was fatty. I have been to Philly  and an original cheesesteak and this is not even close. I thought Capriottis was great compared to this place but it went a little down hill they use less meat and it's dry. If you want a great Philly go to Mikes burgers and cheesesteaks"}
{"text":"I ordered a hot dog, loaded fries and a salad for delivery. when i questioned my total (which was very high considering the food I had ordered) the idiot that took my order failed to mention that there's a $3 \"delivery\" fee. My food took over an hour to arrive. When I handed the delivery man a twenty he did not even pretend that he was going to give me change. Had I been notified of the \"delivery\" fee, I would not have tipped him. Oh, I ordered a 20oz soda, which had leaked all of the cup.

The hot dog and fries were COLD when they arrived. not even warm. The hot dog looked as disgusting as it tasted. I could not finish it. The fries were disgusting and had 2 different kinds of \"cheese\" on them. I could not finish them either. 

The only redeeming quality of the meal was the rance dressing, which was good. Very over priced for what you get. 

I will NEVER eat here again, and would not recommend wasting money on the crap they tried to pass off of as food. 

If you're looking for a good hot dog and fries go to Luke's of Chicago, where they actually know how to prepare a quality meal."}
{"text":"Lunch menu is awesome! Got a slice of pizza and boneless wings for a great price. Huge menu with lots to choose from. Would recommend anyone to stop by and give them a try if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I've tried Geno's THREE TIMES because they carry Boarshead meats.  But every time, I come away disappointed.  The quality is good, but the sandwich is expensive for a walk up ($8.99) and IT'S ALL BREAD.  Today my sandwich had two thin slices of ham and a single slice of cheese that was thicker than the two slices of ham combined.  As a result, the taste of the cheese was overpowering.  I was AGAIN disappointed.

Three times is a charm.  I get it.  I WON'T BE BACK."}
{"text":"Loved it when they first opened. Stopped coming because it was inconsistent and disappointing. Tried again tonight after several months and won't be back. I ordered the pepper philly combo and there were more peppers than meat. It was too dry to swallow. Cheese was only on a small part of the sandwich. I have never left a yelp review, sorry this has to be my first."}
{"text":"If there was an option to rate it with no stars I would since this place is nothing to rave about! The lady that was placing our order with the glasses and short black hair was completely rude and didn't look like she liked her job! Once my dad and I received our food, my dad's salad was wrong so he brought it back up to the counter and once he got back to the table I could over hear that rude lady say something about oh he could've just picked off the olives! The burger I had was cold and not that tasty! I could've got a better burger at Burger King right next door!!! Due to the rude customer service and the crappy food quality my dad and I will never be returning here again!"}
{"text":"Took over 20 minutes to get a two sandwiches and french fries... Fries taste stale... There were only two pieces of meat in my Gyro.... Do not recommend"}
{"text":"Welcome Geno's!  We needed a great cheesesteak in the East Valley.
A group of friends and I went there a week after they opened.  We all enjoyed our sandwiches..they have a good variety.
I got the mushroom and cheese and it was very tasty.
Great service and we were impressed seeing the care they took at checking to make sure the restrooms were clean and tidy.
4 stars for not having brewed ice teas..just the \"push my button\" machines."}
{"text":"ordered for delivery, on the menu the have a Bacon cheddar cheeseburger sub. when it was selected it asked \"how would you like this cooked\" and \"Medium\" was selected.. when the order was entered \"medium\" \"confused them\". instead of calling to alleviate the confusion, they ordered bacon cheese fries and added $2.5 additional charge. so not only did i not get my cheeseburger sub, but i was charged extra for something i didn't order. when i called to explain the situation, they were very receptive to getting a chicken bacon ranch sub out, when the lunch rush calmed down (but i was a customer first). and hour and a half later (grumble, grumble went my stomach), they delivered A BACON CHEESEBURGER SUB!!.. i was extremely disappointed to say the least.. the only reason i gave 2 stars and not 1 is because Alex was apologetic and is able to get my money back for the sub with out any argument."}
{"text":"I went to Genos for the 1st time because I wanted a cheesesteak.  The cheesesteak cost $9.49, which is a bit high for this sandwich.  The cheesesteak was very good, but not filling, especially for $9.49.  For that price, it should come with fries.  The are other cheesesteaks places that give you more meat for the same or less price, like Forefathers, Capriottis, or Corleone's.

If you want a good cheesesteak, this place is good.  If you want a better cheesesteak with sides or more meat, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"As I continue my quest for the perfect cheesesteak, I bring you: Geno's. I have actually eaten here before, and it has always been pretty good, aside from a few rude cashiers and the fact that it is ridiculously, uncomfortably hot in there. However tonight, I found myself in the area and stopped in. Geno's has some magical elixir called Zub Sauce, which is the greatest concoction known to mankind. It is a tangy, vinegary, slightly hot though not really hot but leaves a pleasant twang of heat on the lips. Truth is, anything would be good with that stuff on it but Geno's cheesesteaks are pretty fabulous on their own, too. I am not a fan of mayo on a cheesesteak and recommend you order without, but the bread is always fresh, there's plenty of meat, and they bring it to your table pretty quickly. Tonight the girls at the counter were sweet and attentive, the owner was walking around, smiling at guests and visiting tables while his darling young son went around cleaning. Even though this place is usually packed, the kid made sure there was always a clean table. Best of all, it was cool as a cucumber in there. On the hottest day of the year, it was downright brisk. When the owner came around, I just had to ask, \"Are you under new management or something?\" He said that he hadn't been in the stores as much as he should have been lately, and was making a point to work more hours and be more involved. I told him that it really made a difference. I mean, I was a repeat customer, it wasn't like the negatives were enough to keep me away, but the fact that they have been corrected, well, what more could you ask for? 
Oh, I know- ZUB SAUCE. This stuff would make a turd taste like your mama's thanksgiving dinner. I told the owner I loved the sauce and he told me to take the bottle home. Normally I would say \"Oh no, I couldn't possibly...\" but the thought of being in possession of my very own bottle of Zub sauce was too much to bear. And just when I couldn't be happier, a girl came over and offered to top off the sauce in the bottle before I took it with me. She brought it back full, and with a little piece of tape on top so it wouldn't dribble. \"Put it on eggs!\" the owner exclaimed. Oh yes I will, kind sir. Oh yes I will."}
{"text":"Customer service was bad. They wouldnt honor a coupon, instead they would only offer a 2 dollar discount off the total bill. The owner was rude and mean toward his employees. I'm not sure if I would bring my business back to an employer that was disrespectful toward the people he employs. I have ordered here before and the food was good. However, this does not excuse the lack of customer service and disrespect of management toward their employees."}
{"text":"Great food. Ordered the cheesesteak and garlic fries: good size, hot, and full of flavor. Staff wasn't the friendliest, but it was late on a Sunday evening so we understood and let it slide. Will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"I give Geno's 2 stars only because the word \"Cheesesteak\" is in the moniker. However, these so-called steaks of cheese are just horrible. Wrong bread, not enough meat, too small, and waaaaay too expensive for what you get. If you do happen to stumble into this joint, get the wings and go to the store and buy Steak-Ums. Better quality in the box than on a Geno's bun."}
{"text":"My wife and I have already been to Geno's about 7-8 times since it opened and we continue to go there.  We love the food.  I have always gotten something different every time I but and have always enjoyed what I have gotten. They have plenty of options to cater to any type of taste. My wife likes to make her sandwich custom, and she pretty much gets that every time. 

BTW, I don't agree with the 2 star review, everything they said has not been my experience. They are most likely a competitor (located 5 miles away).  Also that reviewer is a new member with only 1 review, very suspicious..."}
{"text":"I order their chicken wings most of the time and it taste amazing. This time I tried ordering a ham and cheese sub, but when I got it, there was wasabi smeared all on the sub. I could not even eat it. The weird thing is that I didn't ask for any other sauces when I ordered. I'll just stick with the wings."}
{"text":"I was very excited to find out that a cheesesteak joint was moving into that location.  Something different!  My excitement was quickly deflated after purchasing their basic Geno's Cheesesteak.  $9.00 for their large cheesesteak gets you a sandwich that is most definitely on the small side.  My wife, which is not a big eater actually brought that fact to my attention!  As far as taste - nothing special there that holds it above places like Capriottis ($13.49 for their large plain sandwich at Dana Park) or ForeFather's ($9.50 for their large plan sandwich).  I'd rather pay a little more and get a better cheesesteak that would actually satisfy.  Unless this place changes their game plan (price, portions, and taste), I will generously give them 9 - 12 months before they pack up and close shop."}
{"text":"I called my order in over the phone so that I wouldn't have to wait when I arrived at Geno's.  When I arrived the girl at the counter was nice.  She greeted me, made jokes and then handed me a bag of food.  When I arrived at home, I realized that the girl had given me the wrong order.  I drove back to Geno's, and the cashier was expecting me.  She rushed around the counter, apologized and handed me the correct order.  This time the fries were gross.  I waited over 5 minutes for fresh fries.  The staff didn't offer me a complementary meal or anything.  They did give me a free drink upon my request.  The food was decent, but the experience was horrible."}
{"text":"I like their food but they have the Worst delivery ever.  I order 3 regular sandwiches it took 2 hrs I told them to keep the food and I'll never go there again"}
{"text":"I hit Geno's on Sunday afternoon for a late lunch...it was a toss up between this and Teakwood, but I had just seen Geno's the other day and checked the reviews on Yelp before deciding to go for it. 

The place is small, but they have a couple of outdoor tables (YAY!), the staff who greeted me were pleasant, and the place was clean.  Now on to the important stuff...the cheesesteak!

I ordered the pepper philly and didn't change a thing...along with an order of fries (hey - ran five miles that morning...I deserved 'em!).  Loved the cheesesteak!  The bread was soft and fresh, the meat was delish, and the variety of peppers in the sandwich gave it a little bit of tang...although I could've done with a little of heat.  ;) Onions were in there, but not overwhelming.  I added a little bit of their special sauce, but I couldn't really taste it.  The fries were awesome!  Crispy and golden...just the way I like 'em (I'm not a fan of the in and out variety).  I ordered the smaller sized sub and an order of fries and def couldn't finish the fries if I finished the cheesesteak.  

I'll be back and am looking forward to trying some of the other varieties of cheesesteaks!  Tasty!"}
{"text":"It's OK but Cheesesteaks wit whiz is an abomination. American or Provolone please. 
Fried onions were almost nonexistent and the marinara sauce was pasty. 
Plenty of Tastykakes, but pricey. Better places around, like Philly's Famous in Chandler..
Born and raised in Philly."}
{"text":"I was severely disappointed in Geno's. Their food was dry and bland. For a place the advertises cheesesteaks in their name, you would think their cheesesteak would be special.  it was far from it. I won't go there again,  and I wouldn't recommend it for anyone."}
{"text":"The food at Geno's was just OK.  The highlight of the meal was the bread.  Good flavor and tasted fresh.

The atmosphere leaves a whole lot to be desired.  There was a loud mouth obnoxious patron that ruined the entire evening for me.  He was swearing and talking about his marijuana delivery business.  Smooth.  After one mother finally told him she has kids around he settled down for about a minute.  Then one of the workers who knew him got him riled up again.  Encouraging the behavior.

I will never be back to this place again."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE customer service. Gal at the cash register ruined customer for life.  
Completely messed up my order and when I let her know- she just stared at me.  When I complained again she said - I guess I can have them re make it. 
When it was brought back to me it was completely wrong again. No apologies- no customer service.  
Beyond rude and the food was cold."}
{"text":"Disappointed...my husband and I started going here when they first opened and it was really good. But now they added pizza to their menu and changed their bread they use for their subs...bummer."}
{"text":"Just awful.... I ordered a greek salad with grilled chicken... i took it to-go and came home to find brown chicken shavings on my salad.... I don't know where they are from but from where I come from they use 100% white meat chicken breast... cubed!  Not shaven!  Will NEVER come back! Eewwww dark meat & charging like its white meat... Awful!!! Just NOT what I'm used to!"}
{"text":"let me be clear upfront i am comparing this place to the Holy Land of cheesesteaks.  Philadelphia.  (Pats, Genos, Tony Lukes, Jims etc...)

Was very excited to check this place out.  Cheesesteaks are one of my favorite foods.  When I lived on the east coast we would drive to Philly just to get them(usually stopping in Atlantic City too).

I have tried Geno's twice over the past 2 weeks in case i caught them on a bad day.  unfortunately that didnt seem like the case.

In general I prefer whiz without so that is what I ordered.  the first thing you notice is that they dont really fill up the sandwich with meat/cheese.  the bread tends to be a little dry.  the meat doesnt quite compare to what you get in Philly and the whiz seems to be a little runny.  the taste was OK but nothing special.

the side of fries was generic.  i did like the zub sauce that was made available for the fries.

i'll prob give them a 3rd try in a month or two to see if anything has changed.

again I am comparing them to Philadelphia since they are using the name Geno's.  Geno's in Gilbert blows away places like Jerry's and Subway and may very well be the best place in the Phoenix area.  i wouldnt know since this is the first cheesesteak place i've tried here."}
{"text":"The flavor was good but for the price I would have expected a little more meat. I like more meat then bread but other then that it was good. I will try again!"}
{"text":"Eh...

I've eaten here a number of times due to my misfortune of being stuck near the location or because visiting friends want to give it a try. That being said - I think I have had a few items in every category in hopes of not being disappointed. It never works out.

The sandwiches use run-of-the-mill restaurant supply bread allowing it to be stale (if you go later in the week) or even completely out of the more unique variety  - such as wheat. For the average price of about $10 I expect fresh bread. Even subway makes it fresh and they change almost 50% less. 

Burgers are the best item on the menu (taste wise), boneless wings are very small, everything is over priced but they do have some GREAT tasting sauces!

To give the sandwich shop some credit the staff has always been great, the location is very clean and . . . well they make the food for me when I ask them to?

If you're looking for a place for a great sandwich look no further than Harvey American Public House in the same shopping center."}
{"text":"As a person watching what I eat, I thought a place like Geno's was the last place I'd eat in. Boy, was I ever wrong! Their selection was very good as far as what I can and cannot eat. Regardless of where you go, you have to be smart with your choices! 

He owner and staff were very friendly. The service was great. And the food was awesome! Have been back twice in one week... May have to extend that streak. 

Definitely a place to try but be careful, you may get hooked!"}
{"text":"OK, let me just say that I was a little surprised to see a cheesesteak joint using the name Genos. I thought they must be good if they were courageous enough to use the name of the Philadelphia legend. My wife and I stopped in tonight for dinner to check it out. We were met with a friendly staff, prompt service and a very clean dining area. I ordered what I had ordered my whole entire life back in Philly...a cheesesteak with American cheese and mushrooms. No mayo, as they serve it. I added ketchup at the table. They offer many options but this is how I like my steak...I don't like a lot of add-ons to take away from the flavor of the meat. First test, the bread. I asked one of the managers...he told me - they're not Amoroso rolls but they brought some back from the east coast and had their baker clone the bread...down to the cornmeal crumbles on the bottom. Wow!! I was amazed...the rolls were incredible. The steak itself was dead on....lean meat, perfect seasoning...super tasty. At this point I was ready to climb a mountain and announce the majesty I have just witnessed. IT WAS GOOD! As I mentioned above...I thought it was pretty gutsy to use the name Genos...but, as luck would have it - my favorite cheesesteak from back home is Jim's Steaks and this sandwich reminded me so much of Jim's! So, I was/am a happy man. I've also learned they have locations in Casa Grande and a second location in Gilbert. Oh, and they also fly in Tastykakes and Wise Potato Chips...a trio of Philly goodness. Thanks Genos! Everyone....go try it!

{"text":"I enjoyed the burger I ordered, but the cheese fries were completely inedible. I mean this literally, we ordered for delivery and by the time i got them they were practically a fried potato cheese soup. I didn't eat them at all. However, the burger was delicious and I would certainly order another one in the future."}
{"text":"went to Geno's for the first time at I have to say it will be my last.   We ordered the provolone cheese steak sandwich, gyro and fries. The meal cost around $20 so its pretty expensive for casual dining. The \"cheese \" steak was the absolute worst I've ever had. The cheese was non exsistant barely even there, the roll was soggy and cheap quality and the meat if it was meat was closer to canned dog food then steak. The gyro is also horrible. The meat was thin and tasteless, the pita was store bought and generic. The fries are junk too. I have no idea how this place stays in business but. What I do know is its not getting anymore of mine. If you have taste buds then geno's is not the place to go to. 1 star is too high a rating."}
{"text":"Didn't know exactly what to expect but was pleasantly surprised --- Geno's hit all of our hot buttons.  The meatza pizza was very good, the sweet philly cheese steak was very, very good and the garlic & parmesan wings were fantastic!

Based on this first experience, we definitely will go back."}
{"text":"I absolutely love their food! I am not crazy about the customer service, but the food makes up for it. I highly recommend the chicken ranch philly!"}
{"text":"Stopped by today with husband.  We had the Geno's famous philly cheese steak, cheese fries, and wings.  Everything was very salty.  The cheese in the philly cheese steak and fries was very thin.  I wish there was more cheese.  The wings were the worst wings that I had ever had.  The sauce was thin, tasted like they mixed vinegar and tabasco sauce so it was spicy and sour.  Since it was thin it did not cling to the wings.  Although the outside of the wings were crispy, the meat was very chewy.  Fries were crispy but salty and with very thin cheese.  The service was fast and friendly, especially owner.  Place had nice decor and wass clean and comfortable.  Honestly, the only thing that tasted good there were the ranch that came with the wings and the soda.  I would not come back."}
{"text":"Oh man....I've longed for a good cheesesteak place in my 'neck of the woods' FOREVER.

This last time was actually my second trip going in.  The first trip ended up with me empty handed, because they had run out of bread. But the owner saw my disappointing 'sulk' as I walked to my car and called me in.  He wrote me a 'free cheesesteak' note and told me to come back (which he really didn't have to....I would have anyways).

I got the Geno's famous with mushroom and onions.  Normally I get provalone cheese, and forgot to order that, instead of the Whiz.  Wow......I'm glad I did!!   Wit Whiz was delicious! The sandwich was enormous (I got the larger size) and was packed with meat, onions and mushrooms.  I posted a pic on my Facebook, and it generated 47 comments. Hopefully, a lot of those people will also try out Geno's.

I think an earlier reviewer had said something about the sandwich being too small for the price, but on 'bread-less' night, the owner had explained to me they were having problems with the bread.  With the delivery and the sizing, but all the kinks are worked out. (C'mon people, they've only been opened for a couple of weeks....cut them some slack).

Anyways, I'm headed back, most likely, on a weekly basis now.  The owners are cool, and the cashier was really nice too.  And will probably try all kinds of different sandwiches, since the \"regular\" was that good."}
{"text":"Food was awful, too expensive and service was terrible they didn't even accept Yelp coupon. Come on u can't honor the coupon and call yelp and fix it later, was 20% worth losing a customer??? They're lucky I'm giving them a star! Never going back there again!"}
{"text":"We stopped her for a change. I don't want to get into the Pat's vs. Geno's from Philly.  I was just excited at the possibility of a good cheesesteak sandwich.

I ordered the Geno's Special?  Cheesesteak with Cheese Wiz.  It was very disappointing.  $8.99.  Sandwich only.  No chips, no drink.  Fries are another $3.00. 

The sandwich was small.  Not filled very much with meat. I ended up with an inch of bun (at least) without any meat. The buns are soft and do not hold up very well to the juice and mess. Not that there was much in filling to really make much of a difference. 

The only positive was that it did taste good!

But I will not go back.  $13.00 for a sandwich and drink is not worth it.  I would pay this if it were a good sandwich. I would probably pay more..  

Also, my friend had Cheesesteak with Provolone.  Very much the same."}
{"text":"The food here is really good but I hate that the employees are so miserable. I can't get a smile out of them for the life of me! Its sad that I said \"hi\" to the cashier and cook first. The first time we came, we literally sat their and watched them screw up 3 orders and had an \"oops, oh well\" attitude.  I refuse to eat in the store because their attitude seriously ruins my appetite. Sad but true."}
{"text":"I honestly had higher expectations for this place. My husband was craving a Philly cheesesteak sandwich so we decided to try this place out. The employees were young and seemed annoyed to be at work. I could hear them complaining and they were on and off their phones which doesn't bug me normally but they made us feel like we were bothering them. I ordered the turkey sandwich and tried to add some steak to it (which sounds odd but it sounded good in my head) and the girl taking my order just stared at me like I was crazy. So I just said nevermind. When I got my sandwich it was like turkey and cheese in a loaf of bread. I ordered the half size one and it was just so much bread! I don't know if it seemed dry from the size of bread or if it didn't have enough condiments. I heard the pizza was good here so maybe if I feel like bothering the employees again I will order the pizza. Keep it simple."}
{"text":"Return visit for cholesterol bomb aka cheesesteak
Roll was sparse w meat. 2 cheessteaks, fries and drinks over $30
Getting ripped off makes me feel like I'm back in Philly"}
{"text":"When i lived in Chandler this was one of the places that delivered to the house. I like that they had a delivery option, though as with most food....dining in is almost always better. 

Geno's makes a mean Chicken Cheddar Ranch sub and a rockin Provolone Philly. The Cranberry Pecan salad is tasty also if you are looking for something a little lighter (or bread-less.) In addition to the subs the fries are pretty delicious, i enjoy the Bacon Ranch Fries (do not try to get these delivered as they don't travel very well, they get a little soggy.)

The customer service is decent, the delivery times are a little long on the weekends (like most places.)"}
{"text":"I like their cheesesteaks.  They were decent and tasted good.  The cheesesteaks were good enough for me to go back and try again.  I also enjoyed their Italian Sub.  It was authentic enough to the ones I remember growing up on in New Jersey.  One thing I won't order again are the garlic fries.  I don't know what it was that they put on it.  Was it like a garlic mayo?  Definitely not like Gordon Bierch's garlic fries.  They still reign supreme."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a good sandwich, it's tough to beat Geno's. Not a lot of decent places around Gilbert other than TGIF, Applebees, etc...so Geno's stands out. The classic and the provolone are done just right. If you're going to go with take out, get it home fast. As with most cheessteaks, it doesn't take long to get a soggy sandwich. Wings are solid as well."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Geno's Cheesesteak & Deli after seeing people talk about it on Twitter.  We LOVED the sandwiches we had.  I 'only' gave 4 stars due to it being our first visit and we all had variations of the same sandwich 'Geno's Famous Philly.  In my opinion, Geno's Famous Philly is a 5 star sandwich.  My daughter and I shared a whole sandwich, made just like it is on the menu (grilled onions & Geno's cheese sauce), my hubby had the same sandwich adding green peppers and my daughters boyfriend had the same sandwich adding mushrooms.  The meat was tender and so tasty, the grilled onions were perfect and the sauce was delicious.  The rolls were like 'sub' rolls we are use to having grown up in Massachusetts!  

We will definitely be going back and I'd love to say we'll try other things but it's really hard to find a great cheesesteak here in AZ so we might just stick with what we know!  They also have burgers, hot dogs, gyros, wings, salads and deli sandwiches on the menu.

Oh we also had 2 orders of regular fries and 1 order of garlic fries!  All were great and if you like garlic I recommend the garlic fries for sure!


The staff was very friendly, the place was busy but the line to order moved very quickly and the food was also served quickly.

And yes, this is my first review!"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time today. They use all Boars Head deli meat so they had me at hello. Also, the philly's are made of top sirloin. My hubby had the classic with whiz and I had the philly with provo. Both were very good and my hubby was worried because sometimes the whiz can make a philly too salty. Not here though. Bread was super soft. We also tried the fried pickles which were excellent. They were battered in a spicy jalapeno batter. We liked the mac salad too. It had chunks of cheddar cheese and wasn't too sweet or rich like many mac salads. Finally, to sweeten the deal, they sell Philly's original Tasty Kakes by the pack or by the box. LOVE LOVE LOVE Tasty Kakes. Overall, big thumbs up and we are looking forward to trying this place again."}
{"text":"It's really hard for me to find a philly cheesesteak that I like, much less love. But Geno's got me hooked. With their fresh, piping hot, cheesy extra onion n' pepper cheesesteak, it was nothing less than spectacular. It melted in my hands and mouth.

I usually imagine a soggy, tasteless, sandwich like Charlie's, but this place is quite the opposite. The bread was crisp and crunchy, meat was plentiful, and veggies were flavorful. Good presentation, should have taken a picture but I wolfed that mother down. Staff was friendly, and place was clean and stocked. Kinda strange I was the only person there at the time, but it was like 3 in the afternoon. Job well done."}
{"text":"Love the provolone philly but sometimes I get adventurous and try different sandwiches, doesn't matter, never disappointed. Oooh and Tastycakes!! Nuff Said!"}
{"text":"I only gave this deli 1 star because you couldn't choose 0 stars.
I have ordered from Geno's a few times in the past while my husband was camping.  I wanted to be lazy and decided delivery was the best option on a couple of those nights.  The staff was pleasant on the phone those few times which is why when my food was delivered cold and incorrectly I didn't complain.  I felt I was being lazy, so I got what I got.
However, I ordered tonight after a long day of soccer games and was excited that my husband was on board even though he had heard horrible reviews in the past.
My first clue should have been the lady on the phone saying \"Okay your order will be there as soon as it's done,\" then click.  No waiting time or thank you or anything.
Over an hour later our food finally arrived - my husband was at the door with the delivery driver while I was checking to make sure our order was correct.  EVERYTHING was COLD!  COLD Mozzarella sticks, COLD Philly, COLD wings, COLD chili cheese fries, COLD everything!  
The delivery driver tried to walk off as we were advising that the food was COLD.... not very nice in my opinion.
We asked him to take it back and called the manager, who recited the companies guidelines.  We explained the guidelines might be so, however, this food tonight was not acceptable as it was ice cold.  There was nothing they were willing to do to make it up.  It wasn't even offered that they would redeliver hot food.
VERY disappointed with the lack of customer care and the complete lack of customer service.  Sad to say I will not be going back.  Ever."}
{"text":"Just moved into the area and spotted cheese steak on their sign as we were driving by.  I got the famous cheese steak and my wife got the garlic chicken gyro with Greek fries.  

I have to say we were a little skeptical going into it as the variety of selection made us a little worried it wouldn't be that great.  Boy were we wrong!  

The famous cheese sauce and onions made this one off the better cheese steaks I've had outside of Philly.  I was too hap happy with my sandwich to try a bite off my wife's but she said it was very tasty.  And we were both surprised that the feta cheese and Greek dressing on fries went so well together.  My wife doesn't usually eat a lot of fries but this time the while container was empty!

Definite A+ for me and we will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"Pizzas not the best but the fact that it's five dollars and they deliver makes it worth it. I did order a steak fajita salad and seriously it was the most disgusting thing I have ever eaten. They literally used little small slices of beef that I wouldn't call steak that I am assuming they use on their sandwiches cheddar cheese a few bell peppers and 5 pieces of soggy lettuce. Definitely not worth the inflated price but go ahead and try the pizza. It's worth the five dollars"}
{"text":"I've been to this place a couple of times.. stopped by again today after probably 2 years.  While the sandwiches are good, its taken 15 minutes to make them on each occasion.. plus the sandwiches alone are over $10.. and the sandwiches really aren't very big - this price also does not include a drink or anything else.  While it tastes good, it really isn't a very good value.  If you can wait a while and pay more than most other places, this place is for you.  Despite the great tasting sandwich, I probably won't go back.. I'm really mixed on this place."}
{"text":"If I'm in the mood to put on a few pounds I like to come to Geno's for a \"famous Philly\" and an order of the bacon ranch fries. The bacon ranch fries are ridiculously good eatin and ridiculously bad for you at ethe same time. I always get the traditional Philly cheesesteak and have never tried any of the other sandwiches or hamburgers. My wife likes their pitas. They do have other options such as deli sandwiches or hamburgers, which is nice. A lot of the Yelp reviews indicate service is an issue but that has not been a problem for me. Once I ordered a couple of sandwiches \"to-go\" and when I got home found out that my wife's pita had onions on it when she asked for them to be taken off. I called Geno's and told them. The girl that answered the phone told me a new one would be waiting when I got back. I live 5 minutes from there and when I walked inside it was just being finished. Overall the food and the service are good. I will be back."}
{"text":"Come on guys, we recently received a deliver menu for this location.  We called to place a take out order.  Many items are no longer offered, no Greek fries,  etc.  why send out a flyer that is not correct.  The sandwiches were all bread, I was very disappointed about the quality of food and menu.  We will not be going back!  Stay clear of this place."}
{"text":"Great gyro and fries! My buddy came along and got the hot dog and apparently it was amazing. Nice little atmosphere with TVs, Feel like it's a great place for a quick bite that's not too expensive."}
{"text":"First time here...had the Famous Philly.  the sandwich had a very good taste, it was hot and the roll was very fresh.  My only complaint is that for $9 bucks the sandwich needs more meat for my liking.  The staff was very friendly and quick to serve your food."}
{"text":"I've now been here 4 times and I swear it gets better every time. Today I enjoyed the Geno's Famous Philly (keep in mind I have never been a big fan of Philly cheesesteaks) and it was one of the best meals I have had in a while. Add in the fact that there is a 20% check in offer and I will soon be the Duke of this place!"}
{"text":"I started with 4 stars because the food was good but not special. I got the famous cheesesteak combo. The bread was fresh & tasty with a fair amount of meat. The fries were not too old.  I also got a slice of cheese pizza that was pretty good too. The crust was baked fresh. 

I took off another star because of the iced tea. If you are a soda drinker, you are good to go here with coca-cola products; however if you enjoy iced tea, they have the nasty Gold Peak fake syrup tea. May as we'll have instant tea.   

If I should ever return, I will bring my own beverage."}
{"text":"I recently stumbled across this place, and I'm a BIG fan of cheesesteaks.  The sandwich had great flavor, but the portion size seemed small.  The bun they use is almost hot-dog-bun-size, so the full size cheesesteak almost looks like a footlong hotdog.  The meat is proportionate to the bun size, and as I said already, it was tasty.

Overall, it's more like 3.5 stars, but Forefathers is still the best cheesesteak I've had in the East Valley."}
{"text":"After church we were looking for a place to grab a bite to eat.  We saw Geno's and decided to check it out.  My wife ordered the Italian and I have the Cheesesteak.  Gotta say, we were both very pleased! Bread was soft and tastey and very filling! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I was getting my nails done at the salon next door when I saw a flier advertising for Geno's. I'm a vegetarian but my husband loves meat so I tucked a flier in my purse.

This evening I showed my husband the flier and and he saw the veggie/meat options. So we hopped in the car and drove around the corner. The place was packed - always a good sign. We placed our order and was told it would be a 20 minute wait. Kinda long... but what the heck, we had nowhere else to be.

The food was delicious and my husband loved his sandwich. I found it concerning that the veggie sandwich (cheese,onion,pepper, mushroom) cost the same as the other subs. $9 for a veggie sandwich? My husband thought the price was fair for a full meat sub but certainly not a veggie. Sadly, as much as we liked this place I don't picture myself spending this much on a veggie sandwich in the future. I really wish they would reconsider the price on this item - it was expensive :(

Try the Zub sauce - it was great!"}
{"text":"I went back and the cheesesteak was definitely heartier and messier, just the way I like it! The customer service was much better, too!"}
{"text":"Do not waste your time and money!!!!  Sandwich was all bread and the meat was very dry!!!  My buddy ordered a gyro....huge mistake!!!  Pita was very cold and fell apart.  It taste nothing like a gyro!!

This place sucks!!  What a waste of $20"}
{"text":"First off, I am not from Pilly so if you are judging this place based on how great the subs are compared to Pat's or Gino's in Philly, I can't help you with that question.  

However, this place is clean, staff are friendly, service is good, food is very good.  Definitely a great choice for lunch with their 6.49 for a cheesesteak of your choice, fries or chips and a drink.
And don't restrict yourself to just regular cheesesteak with the yellow cheese, those are good, the ones here are very juicy and cheesy :)  But check out their other cheesesteaks, they have one with peppers which they pair with some semi-spicy peppers and white cheese.  Its a great combo as the white cheese does not overwhelm the taste of the peppers.  I have been here twice and had the regular and the pepper and both are very yummy.

Also, you will be surprised that they sell pretty decent pizza here.  Its not the dominos-full of tomato sauce below their cheese pizza, but actual decent ingredients you can see and taste and comment on their freshness.  We had a lady give us some pepperoni and sausage pizza slices to us the first time we went, not cause its no good, but because they were expecting a smaller pizza; and the large she ordered was too big for her and her son.  They too have a nice pizza deal, 5 dollars for a large pizza and every topping after it is just 1 dollar.  You really can't beat that.  Anyway, the pizza the lady gave us was cold but it still tasted very good and fresh, and not overflowing with the canned tomato sauce you find in most delivery pizza.

Last but not least, they deliver, so if you live around this area, good for u, I came here for lunch but I live in the other direction so I guess I will have to check out their other branch in tempe.  But really, come here for the fast friendly service and really decent cheesesteak.  Oh and don't get that weird tasting cheesesteak from subway, come here and get some of this, your tummy will thank you :)"}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to try Geno's today! I've been waiting for a good sandwich shop to open in my neighborhood! I had the \"Geno's Italian\" on wheat not toasted. It was perfect. Thinly slice onions and tomatoes, full of meat (big fan of boar's head), cheese, lettuce and house dressing. My boyfriend had the pastrami on white (no Swiss) it was also very good, the only issue was we had asked for it to be toasted and it was not... No biggie the place was poppin'. Being in the industry, I know how it is opening a new place with new staff getting worked... I have high hopes for this place. 

Ps I think the negative review on here might just be a competitor... LAME."}
{"text":"Really good provolone Philly and I love the fries. What I really appreciate is that it's very clean and the employees are nice. The food is served pretty quick."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, great staff, great prices. Why someone would go to a Subway or Quiznos in this area when there is an establishment this much better baffles my mind. The meats are phenomenal (Boars Head), the cheese is unbeatable, the bread is fresh, a few selections in teas (black sweetened, black, green sweetened, and raspberry), AWESOME brownies, and snack cakes only found back east. This place is great!"}
{"text":"Really yummy grilled chicken cheesesteak! Freshly made and friendly service. I like the lunch special with fries and drink for under 6.00!"}
{"text":"Only ordered from this place because it was convenient. Last 2 times was very disappointing. Probably will not go again.  Too many kids running the place with no visible manager to give them direction.  They forget about orders, don't care how they come out and really are going to take a good investment and ruin it for the manager/owner.  Try another place if you can help it."}
{"text":"ONE STAR IS TOO MUCH FOR THIS HOLE BUT WE HAD TO GIVE IT SOMETHING.....


I must say that after reading several other reviews I really should have read more of them  before I gave this place a try again.  We walked in on a quiet Thursday night with the place practically deserted. We were not greeted nor asked to place an order, we just kinda rolled up to the register and \"said can we order now\", and the girl said sure! We order two (2) simple cheese steak sandwiches with fries. We must have waited over 20 mins  but still no food but we noticed how many people were picking up their food to go. I asked why customers waiting inside the restaurant were being delayed while orders were passing us by?   Needless to say, after another few mins the food was served  but on a TWO DAY OLD BREAD and meat that looked like it had been recycled. I could't est it and received my money back. We went across the street to Barros Pizza and was very happy with the service and meal. SAVE YOURSELF THE TIME AND EXPENSE AND CHOOSE ANOTHER PLACE LIKE LUKES TO ENJOY THE KIND OF FOOD WE WERE SUPPOSED TO RECEIVE AT THIS PLACE."}
{"text":"So despite the bad reviews I wanted to try this place for myself. I walked in and ordered the place was very clean but it was completely empty (bad sign number 1). The woman at the counter told me it would be a couple minuets (bad sign number 2 because it should take a bit longer to make a fresh Philly). While I'm waiting I see the people in the back playing around (bad sign number 3) and I know it happens I do it myself with my co-workers but there was not one person in there before or after me so they could have waited. My food was actually ready in those 2 mins ( bad sign number 4). I go home which btw is right down the street so the fact that I opened this thing and the sandwich was super soggy made me a bit angry. It was also mess which is sometimes expected of a Philly but nonetheless disheartening. I take my first bite and there are so many things wrong man. The bread tasted rubbery and the meat was absolutely disgusting and flavorless, AND the wiz they used was thin. I'm not one to throw away something I paid for but this was an exception, $6 is way too much for a half Philly here but that's ok because I'm never going back."}
{"text":"The Geno's Famous Cheesesteak was excellent.

I'm starting the review off with a 4-star (yay i'm a fan) but not because anything was wrong... I've only been in there once and have yet to try everything nor have I tried the delicatessen side of the board. If it's as good as the cheesesteak was though... it'll easily be a 5.

So the Geno's Famous. I didn't get any custom stuff, just the way Geno's wants it. It was excellent. The bread was very good too, very soft and even the corners were baked right and not hard like others I've had in az. They don't use whiz, which technically could be an issue for some but I'm not getting into that argument because I'm not from philly and I don't care. Some cheesesteak places pride themselves on it, others have their own mix - it's all good to me because I get to eat it all :)  
The onions were cooked very good, real soft and tasty but didn't take away from the meat. Speaking of, the meat was very good, like a distinct taste I can't really put my head around just yet - I need another one to pin it down. But it was very good meat.  So with all that said... the sandwich rocked - I'll easily be back for sure.

Venue... very clean in and out, very visible location from Williams Field road north side. The girl actually spotted it the other night when we hit up the froyo place across the way. Walked in right up to the counter. Service was fast and cordial.  Upon taking a picture (for yelp of course) a guy started talking to me, whom seemed to be the owner perhaps? Nice guy, asked what we ordered and suggested I tried some of their sauce... he made sure we got that added on the side before we left.. Not sure if he's Geno, but nice fella.

Forgot to mention the fries...  Fries either suck hard or their just good. These fries were just good and pushing damn tasty... I dont know if it's the oil they use or some special seasoning (didn't seem salty at all tho) but they were good. It's on rare occasion that I finish a basket of fries.

Overall I suggest you check it out. I'm sure that was the best cheesesteak I've had in Arizona so I can't wait to return and try another variant and see what they have to offer behind the deli because there needs to be some good lunch places out here in Gilbert... Geno's is off to a great start.  See you in there."}
{"text":"I'm not even going to pretend to be a cheese steak connoisseur; I've probably had 3 in my whole life.  So no, I don't know what they're supposed to taste like but I had one here and the meat tasted like it had been chewed up already, it was a horrible texture, almost like ground beef.   

Let me back up... when I went inside to order the food the three high school girls working the counter were in deep conversation and I had to wait until they were done to order.  I ordered the two sandwiches, fries to split and a soda.  When I got home there were no freaking fries!
  
Hopefully the other things on the menu are better because I hate seeing small businesses fail.  

My one star is for the diet coke."}
{"text":"The menu is pricey for steak sandwiches I know it Gilbert but come on. They should look at running specials to keep the prices down. The quality and portions are not as high as would like think for the price you paying.

They are better place in the valley as better prices for the same product."}
{"text":"Great Sandwiches!! I first tried Geno's when they opened their smaller store on Higley and Germann. My husband and I feel in love with their cheese steaks. They are seriously the best I've had since I moved west from NY 15 years ago! That location also has inexpensive pizza, which is pretty good, for a $5 pizza. A few months later they expanded to this location and only serve their yummy cheese steaks here. That was kind of odd, but its ok because it is worth the extra drive, and they still kept my house in their delivery range. I have since tried some of their other sandwiches, and they are also delicious. 

The service at the small location was a little off. The cashiers were never very nice or helpful on the phone, and not great in person either. You could hear them getting yelled at in the background sometimes as well. But, at this location, that issue has definitely been corrected. The staff there is super friendly, and more than willing to help you make a selection."}
{"text":"Stopped in with great expectations...sorely disappointed.  Flavor of the sandwich was ok but certainly not anything to brag about.  The most disappointing thing was that it was so over priced for the product we received.  I really expected a fair amount of meat which we did not have on our sandwiches. Bread was on the verge of being stale.  Would also appreciate it if the staff would smile and speak loud enough to understand what they are saying."}
{"text":"I just ordered 2 cheese steak combos, what a disappointment. Definitely not authentic, if you are wondering I am from Philadelphia.  Over priced and the sandwich is very small, $26.60 for the two combos. Check out my photos for a better reference.   The website photo makes the sandwich  look much bigger.  I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Meh pretty much sums it up. 

I got their regular cheese steak w/ provolone, add bacon. The bread wasn't too bad but I found the meat to be dry and tasteless. 

Fries were ... just fries. 

Def not worth $8, won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"If there were less stars I would have given it. Order placed online said 30mins. Went to pick it up said another 45 mins. Manager refused to come out, we waited 20 mins for him still never came out.poor girls infringe had to deal with us. Finally got our order they comped the meal. Got home got order wrong. Gluten free pizza was not so wife couldn't eat.
Well never go back subs ok but need better bread."}
{"text":"portions are small expensive not worth 13 dollars sandwich fries and a drink very little meat sandwich it's 730 in the place is dead I am disappointed."}
{"text":"We had a late lunch here, food was very good, but a little pricey.

Place was VERY clean and employees were friendly and actively cleaning tables and floor - GOOD!

Wings were smaller than the ones you normally get at places like buffalo Wild wings, but sauces were awesome! w had Garlic hot and Tangy Spicey.

Also had :
half Philly,
Bacon Ranch Fries
Turkey Sandwich, 
Fried Pickles 
and all were good.
$31 for a BIG lunch for 2.
We'll be back

{"text":"We saw this place as we were leaving the froyo place across the street and came back later that week to check it out. It's on the North side of Williams Field Rd, west of ValVista (in the strip next to Blue 32 Sports Grill). We walked in and went straight up to the counter to order; the employee was nice & helpful taking our orders and payment quickly. We then waited by one of the tables as we ordered to go. One of the managers/owners (I assume) came over to us and started talking when he saw Chuck take a picture of their wall mural. After Chuck said he was taking the picture to put on Yelp, the guy was like \"are you guys going to write a review?\" and asked us what we ordered and gave us their \"sub sauce\" to try - very nice guy. 

After we got home, I dug into my original cheesesteak and it was delicious. The meat had great flavor and had the perfect amount of cheese on it (maybe a few too many onions for my taste, but no biggie). Their fries were amazing - I have no idea why they were so good, but they had the perfect texture/consistency that I wish I had room for more in my belly. 

Excited to go back and try something else off their menu."}
{"text":"The Cheesesteaks are always delicious.  I just tried the Garlic Fires and they were great!   Leave your calories counter at home though..."}
{"text":"Well as you may already know Geno's is now called Buddy's.  I never tried Geno's so I can't compare the two but Buddy's is not a place I will visit again.  $50 bucks for 4 sandwiches and 2 fries and the food was a huge let down.  The Phillys were awful with crusty dried bread and stupidly runny cheese whiz.  If you've had a real Philly with whiz it's much thicker.  The meat (both chicken and steak) was very generic.  The other subs we bought were equally as bad and the gourmet fries were stale and small portioned.  The ranch is pretty good though!

So the food is very subpar and over priced.  Not a winning combination for any restaurant."}
{"text":"I live in gilbert. Called the Gilbert location listed on website. I use to call this number all the time, but the store was under renovation.. understandable, yes. But they gave me another number to call in gilbert, called them they said no your not near us, they must  have been mistaken.. Ok... So called the other number they gave me, and they transferred me again!!! This time the number I was given was for Tempe!!! The managers don't do anything and they keep saying sorry, but after the fourth time being transferred I am not happy, I just simply wanted a sandwich and side, but I am never calling again after that \"incident\" they call it. Just damn unprofessional."}
{"text":"What a Shock!

Had Philly Cheese Steaks coast to coast including Philly.  In 55 years of enjoying sandwiches;  This Gilbert Geno's has the distintion of being one of the worst sandwiches I have had.  I got a large on an OK bread with a small serving mix of goo that reminded me of Manwich out of a can.  Or Cincinnati Chili.   Either way, putting the Geno's name on it would make Joey Vento roll in his grave"}
{"text":"UPDATE 6/24/14
I had a check in offer I decided to use tonight for dinner. I called in my order to pick up, and once I arrived everyone was cheery and welcoming, and the very helpful young lady that was working the other night helped me out again. Even more awesome, she remembered my daughter and I! Had the chicken pita and garlic fries, and they were delicious! Had to add the 5th star! Great experience tonight


Original Review
My daughter and I had dinner here a few days ago. It was our first visit, and we really enjoyed the food. We shared a gyro pita, Greek fries, and boneless bbq wings. We ate in, the food was made quickly....the only reason it's 4 stars and not 5, is when the kitchen staff rang the bell for the front of the house staff to pick up the food(there was a ton of food ready in the window btw), the one who was NOT busy did not immediately check to see what was ready to go bring it out.... Pretty much waited around a few minutes not doing anything. There were at least 3 other families in the dining room waiting for their food, plus I know they had some call in / to go orders also waiting. So, kudos to the kitchen, and the young lady who helped us out and took our order, perhaps the other employee was just having an off day. Or maybe she's the reason for the other reviews on here saying their to go/ delivery order took forever? Either way I'll be returning(for now), because the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"I've only been here once but I must say it was a delicious experience! Although I felt they put wayyy tooo much mustard on my pastrami sandwich, my little sister loved their bbq philly, and the garlic fries were divine!

I'll definitely be going back to try something new on the menu...we'll see if my review changes ;)"}
{"text":"Worst restaurant EVER. Food was cold. My Gyro was flavorless and the meat was dry and the bread fell apart because it was so dry. I wouldn't even recommend this place for dogs!! Worst of the valley. Owners should just give up and close this shop."}
{"text":"Great Cheesesteaks and a friendly atmophere with TV's to watch while eating..  A bit pricy but overall its a good place to eat!"}
{"text":"poor service.  Ordered twice for delivery.. always at least 30 -40 min late from promised delivery time."}
{"text":"I was terribly disappointed by experience today.  I placed an order on GrubHub for delivery and it took almost two hours to arrive.  When it did not arrive at the estimated time I contacted GrubHub and they contacted the restaurant who advised it would be here in ten more minutes.  When the driver arrived he said \"sorry for the delay but I am the only driver today\".  The food was all cold and soggy.  It is bad enough that it took so long to arrive but worse to know that my food had been riding around for so long while he made other deliveries."}
{"text":"So I've had this before and after it was \"Buddy's\". Unfortunately the Phillys I had before the change were better. Moister meat, more cheese wiz, etc. Hope they get back to that. I love to go to this place while in Gilbert!"}
{"text":"It's no secret that I'm a fan of Cheesesteaks and Pizza. In spite of the fact this place seems like it is some big national chain, it's actually a small local thing with only a handful of locations and a few different owners. It's definitely worth a look. 

I had lunch here today, and it's now 5pm and I'm still feeling good about it. I ate a cheeseteak this time - a full - it's a lot of food. The sandwich was stuffed with a copious amount of flavorful strip steak and traditional cheese whiz. The bread was a fresh and chewy roll that was almost like a bagel texture and flavor. It was sturdy enough that it didn't get soggy or fall apart as I took my time devouring the thing. 

Most cheesesteaks in the Valley are at least pretty similar if the restaurants source their food from the same distributor (which most do) - and even though it's a fairly simple sandwhich, it's easy to mess up or get wrong. I'm happy to report that the cheesesteak here is reliably delicious, and apart from some of the local places that do cheesesteaks vastly different from the norm (for better or worse), this one is among the top choices. 

Next time, I'm definitely going to have to try their pizzas. 

The owner here is really nice, and we chatted for a bit about this and that... if I find myself in this part of town again, I'll definitely come back. They apparently have a pretty huge delivery area too if you live nearby. I mean, you can get burgers, hot dogs, subs, wings, pizza, salads, and cheesesteaks delivered? If you suck at cooking, you can have something different delivered every night of the week. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"I lived in Philly for a decade, and I am very familiar with Pat, Geno, Jim, and Dalessandro.  I've never been a Geno's fan, and this continues to be true here in Arizona. And even as a Pat's fan, I can say this location is not worthy of the name Geno's. The bread is wrong, and the lack of a-la-carte pricing sucks. Someone who just wants a REAL cheesesteak (cheese and onions) shouldn't be paying the same as someone who wants mushrooms, peppers, red sauce, etc.."}
{"text":"LOVE Geno's! They use to be good, but just stopped by there the other day and they must have improved something because it was better then good. Haven't tried their pizzas yet, but that's next on the list."}
{"text":"This nice little shop just opened TODAY! Nice to see as a lot of the little stores in the area have gone under.

Simple review, they make a nice cheesesteak. They got the basics. Good bread. Don't over cook the meat. Use good cheese. And they have Boar's Head Meat so thinking they are NE guys. I had a Mushroom with Provolone, half. Good eating.

The place was clean, friendly service, order at the counter but plenty of tables if you want  want to eat there. I'll go back."}
{"text":"Waited until we tried this place 4x before leaving this review.

1st time: Excellent. Bread a bit dry but other than that, excellent Cheeseteak and Fries.

2nd time: Horrible. Very dry Bread. Worst Rueben we have ever had.

3rd time: Corn beef sandwich was like eating cardboard, Cheesesteak was good but the bread was dry

4th time: Horrible. Tried their Parmesean and Garlic wings, had no taste at all. Tasted like just Chicken wings fried and served. Not even any salt. PASS! Cheesesteak was dry and the meat was overcooked. Tried the Rueben again. 2 tiny slices of Pastrami between 2 dry pieces of bread.

This place has SERIOUS consistency issues. Which is not surprising because they also have a pizza joint by the same name which has great thin NY style slices if you go during the day but if you order a Large pizza it is god awful and doughy."}
{"text":"Cheesesteak is amazing.....however I think they are using prices from NYC! $10 for a sub is crazy in Gilbert, AZ. - 5 Stars if they had AZ appropriate pricing."}
{"text":"Don't think I would go here again unless I used a groupon deal to save some money!  I love sandwiches and the one I had here was just so so. My boyfriend brought me here because he knows how much I love garlic fries.  I wouldn't get them here again, they weren't that great.

Growing up in the bay area, ca I know what garlic fries should taste like.  I would recommend getting them at Diamondback stadium or Yardhouse!  If that is what you are looking for ;)!"}
{"text":"I love their cheese steaks!  I've never had a \"real\" one from philly, but I would guess it is close to what Genos serves.  I have also had their deli sandwiches a few times, and they are also very tasty and filling.  The fries are ok, just a bit bland."}
{"text":"I've only ever had their pizza (which is fabulous) until today, when I got their provolone philly. It was really, really good. I got a half sandwich, and I am glad I did because it was GIGANTIC. I got fries and a drink as well... the fries definitely leave something to be desired. Granted, I got my food delivered, and maybe that's why they were lukewarm and soggy... it's possible.... but I still didn't really eat them.
The prices are decent, as well, with my whole meal costing around $7... it was worth it.
The saving grace was the friendly staff and the absolutely mouth-watering philly. The sandwich was made to my specifications and was just absolutely yummy. I would recommend getting the provolone philly to just about anyone (except vegetarians and vegans)."}
{"text":"I have seen this place a few times and wanted to give it a try.  I am glad I did.  First I have had a \"few\" Cheesesteaks in my day while I lived in Philly for 8 years. I also ate at the places namesake, Genos in South Philly.  No not as good, sorry Gilbert Genos, but without the Philly bread you had no shot.  On the good side, the bread was decent and their Genos steak was made CORRECTLY with cheese whiz. If you have never had a real Philly then do yourself the favor and get it wit whiz, wit back there means onions and whiz well, I am sure you know what that is.  

The manager there was very friendly and attentive and when he found out I had lived in Philly he was very interested in my opinions.  I did give him the suggestion for gravy fries a staple at diners all over that area. 

The place was clean, the food was delivered quickly and happily the place was busy for a Thursday lunch.

I will defiantly be back....oh and other Philly fanatics, yes they have Tastykakes for sale."}
