{"text":"What a disappointment! Some other friends of mine raved about this place... perhaps we ordered the wrong items. My friend and I both ordered risotto dishes. My friend order the mushroom risotto with beef. The taste was good but the dish was waaaaayyy too watery... which is not very appetizing for risotto and certainly not what we were expecting. I ordered a risotto dish that was part of their lighter summer menu and not on their regular menu. I can't remember what the dish was called.. but all I remember is that it contained corn, and LOTS of it. While I don't mind corn, I wasn't expecting so much of it in my risotto.. to the point that all I could taste was corn... and I really didn't get the texture and flavour of the risotto. I might as well have ordered a mexican or southern dish. This is certainly not what I was expecting for a italian dish.

So both entrees were misses... so we decided to try our hand at dessert. We ended up choosing their crepe... which sounded delicious on the menu.. however, when it came out, it was a disappointment as well. The crepe was very doughy... certainly not what I was expecting... 

To sum it up, I wouldn't go back... the place is not cheap.. the entrees are pretty expensive... but don't live up to the standard...  I'm sure you can find better quality Italian food in Calgary."}
{"text":"This restaurant now has executive chef Gusieppe Di Gennero of CAPO in inglewood. The menu is now a lot better but is smaller, which is more quality IMO and the portions smaller. But the prices are still very reasonable and the food tastes great now coming from such a highly rated chef! 

Think of it as a way to have one of Calgary's best chefs menu's at a reasonable night outs prices.

Try it again if you haven't been since this spring."}
{"text":"Although my family doesn't live too far from Sorrentino's, nothing has enticed us to visit on a regular basis. Unfortunately, after our last visit we probably won't be coming back.

We were surprised at how empty the restaurant was when we arrived. In fact, the entire time we were at dinner there was only one table other than ours (granted, it was Wednesday evening, but still...)

As three out of five of us are pollo-vegetarians, we asked whether the Chicken Saltimbocca had bacon or any other red meat in it. The server looked a little confused, but then assured us that it was \"just chicken.\" Also consumed were the mushroom pizza, sans bacon, calamari, eggplant parmigiana and linguine. 

Partway into a bite of the chicken, we discovered that there was ham stuffed into the centre. Disappointing, considering we'd gone through the effort of asking about it and were assured it was just chicken. We let the server know and she brought out a piece of chicken breast (after the rest of us had finished our meals, though).

The parmigiana was far too salty (and this is coming from someone who could eat salt out of a shaker) and the mushroom flavours on the pizza were overwhelming to the point that it wasn't enjoyable.

We were charged for full price, despite the mix up with the chicken."}
{"text":"I recently visited Sorrentino's for a closed function, invite only-style.  I was surprised that this function would have taken place at such a nice restaurant.

I thought the ambiance of this place was extremely flattering to the layout.  They have nice big curtains framing the windows and a lovely fireplace in one corner.  Half-way through the meal the fireplace was turned on and it gave the place a nice, toasty-warm feel to it.

The service we experienced during our function was pretty standard.  I wasn't blown away by the service and, to be honest, was actually a little scared of one of the busser ladies.  All-in-all they did a great job serving all the tables at the same time.

The food they served was just a bit above mediocre.  The soup was a nice zucchini-tomato that was actually quite delicious.  The main course that we were served was not my favourite.  It was a crepe wrapped around a tomato ground veal with mushroom sauce on top.  I didn't know it was veal until after the meal and was definitely not pleased.  I suppose that explains why I didn't like it.  I couldn't believe they would serve something like veal to a group of people who don't know what they're going to be eating.  I was pretty mad about it.

I checked out the prices as we were leaving the restaurant and they seemed pretty normal for a nice Italian restaurant.  I'd like to go again so I can try something I actually want to eat.  I have high hopes for Sorrentino's so I'll give it another try next time I'm in the area."}
