{"text":"Both the food and service here are mediocre.  The chefs have really bad temper too and were grouchy towards customers."}
{"text":"Food is so so. The service is really terrible. Regret that we went there, and would never ever go there again."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of spicy Sichuan food. I got off work late and ended up looking for dinner at 12am and was surprised to see this restaurant open on a Tuesday night. I decided to give it a go and ordered my typical go to Sichuan dishes (spicy beef in oil, broccoli and white rice). The garlic broccoli was typical, nothing special, totally satisfied my need for greens and tasted fresh. The spicy beef was decent. The chilli oil had a nice flavour, spice and cumin blend. The beef quality itself was a bit hit or miss. Some pieces tasted different and were a bit chewy. Not sure if it's cause I showed up in the middle of the night. I might try it again if I'm in the area late at night."}
{"text":"Worst service ever, and can't help but think it's because we're not Asian. Rude. After waiting 15 minutes to order, it wasn't until they saw us put our jackets on to leave that someone came over.   We explained we wanted hot pot, and the reaction we got was \"if you don't like it, can't send it back\"  We should have used out judgment and left. The bowl showed up with more chills & pepper corns than chicken, veggies or noodles.   Now that we are done, not once did someone respond to our attempts for service.   If you're white, don't waste your time or money. We have too many fantastic spots that won't be rude."}
{"text":"im chinese fyi and i can say its the most legit mapo tofu i ever had... forgot to even take a pic... always getting mapo tofu from here on"}
{"text":"The Dan Dan Noodles with Spicy Sauce were not the typical \"dam dam\" noodles type made with peanut butter.  Instead, it was a bowl of noodles swimming in a pool of spicy oil.  While the dish was spicy, it was still a very good bowl of noodles.  We were able to take the spice.  The Szechuan Style Sliced Lamb contained many slices of lamb sitting in a bowl also with spicy oil and sauce.  There were also glass noodles and bean sprouts near the bottom of the bowl which soaked up all of the spicy oil.  This was a perfect dish to go with steamed rice!  The slices of lamb were delicious.  The House Special Fried Pancake was really a chives pancake and I've had this many times in other restaurants; it is one of my favourite Chinese side orders to get.  I found that the portion size was good here but the pancake itself was very chewy.  I wish there were more scrambled eggs and vermicelli inside of the pancake too."}
{"text":"Everything just felt super oily and heavy.  I had the Water Cooked Fish (essentially oil, dry chilly and lots of peppercorn). And a stir-fry noodle. The fish was flavorful, but often over powered by the peppercorn that got stuck onto the meat. The stir-fry was typical.  I know many of my Chinese friends are into this type of cuisine, but it just felt too unhealthy for me. I was wiping my oil drenched lips every few bites.  Service was good though!"}
{"text":"For hot chilli lovers! Service wasn't the best,but the food def. made up for it. This place is packed after 11pm,open till late. Great place for hangovers,but be careful not to overdo the fried stuff."}
{"text":"Came here for a few times and had hits and misses each time. Fav was the congqing spicy fried chicken (which felt like 75% dried chilis) and stir fried pancake (not spicy).  Definite misses were the spicy marriage (tripe tasted weird) and various stir fried lamb dishes, which wasn't seared enough to get a nice crisp.  The interior is nicely spaced so tables aren't cramped. Meat dishes tend to be on the small side tho so make sure to order enough food!"}
{"text":"Located in a strip plaza where most of the restaurants are open until the wee hours of the morning, even during the week. Service is so so but prices are good. This restaurant is somewhat less popular than others on the other end of the plaza."}
{"text":"Updating my review to 2.5 stars. We went here last night at 9:45 in the evening, knowing that this place is one of the better choices for late night eats. As expected, the place wasn't busy at this time, with only 3 tables occupied including ours. They have 2 servers and took them quite a while to give us the menu, and coming back to take our orders. We had to literally flag them down to get their attention. I was expecting more of a prompt service on slow times like this. When we finished eating, I paid and requested for takeout for the leftovers. I have been going to this place long enough to know that they always pack the leftovers for you. My mistake was I paid first and they already got the tip so they won't care to pack it for you anymore. Next time, I would pay at the last moment  :)"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a year now but once in awhile only for their spicy beef and chili crispy chicken!   This place has the worst service ever! I mean worst!!! When we came here to have a late dinner, the server was gossiping and laughing with the table next to us and no one has approached us for 15 mins. She keeps looking at our table and still continues to talk, I finally raised my hand to get her attention and she rudely said \"ready?\". After we ordered she forgot our drinks even though we reminded her constantly.  The crispy chicken is soooo spicy. I can't take spicy but this is sooooo addictive and for some reason I beat through the pain. I kid you not. There's a lot of chili peppers fried with some spices and the chicken is super crispy. The beef on the other hand is so tender and like the chicken very spicy so beware! Both very flavorful!!  We usually order plain rice and pop. This place is open till 5am! Great place to hangout and eat after a long night of partying and drinking"}
{"text":"hmmm.......... just 2 reviews and 2 stars?!  Guess I came here on a lucky day with good service and picked the right dishes.  \"Saliva\" chicken is the best.  Don't be scared by its name tho.  It's poached chicken in chili sauce (for most restaurants), but Hot Taste has added sesame sauce.  This is the first time I had this chicken with sesame sauce and I just love it!  The sauce was real goooood!!  Tomato egg noodle and spicy deep fried beef are highly recommended as well.  The spicy deep fried beef was loaded with red chili peppers, and we had to dig out the beef from that mountain of red chili peppers.  The tomato egg noodle was such a refreshing dish after all those spicy food.   If you like spicy, this is the place : )    **They don't do lunch **"}
{"text":"Great place if you like spicy stuff. The price was decent, for dinner we paid $16 per person (group of 9). The pepper lamb, papper fried chicken, papper fish, and chicken with mushroom were pretty good. The plaza has additional parking at the back and in the basement"}
{"text":"This place used to be one of my go-to restaurants when I wanted spicy food, but recently they must have changed their chef or recipes.  The food used to be really good because it was salty. Now most of the dishes I tried are SWEET (like they added too much sugar to it), which made a lot of their dishes (in my opinion) taste a lot worse..   I'm not sure if I'll go back here again now. I may check it out again in 2-3 months to see if they reverted to their old style of flavour."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.   The Sichuan style deep fried chicken and spicy beef are well worth the trip to Richmond Hill. The crispness of the fried chicken is complimented well by the spice level of the red chili peppers and Chinese five spice. I consider myself to have a fairly high heat tolerance but do not take these chilies lightly as they pack a punch.   The spicy beef is also made with the same chilies and spice blend. The beef is very tender but can get a bit oily at times.   The restaurant itself is a late night dive for northern Chinese cuisine and the service can be hit or miss at times but the food is worth a try."}
{"text":"3.5 (+ .5 for amazing soup)  If you're a fan of spicy food, definitely give this place a try.  Pros: Very good fish soup Spicy food lovers haven  Cons: Portions are on the smaller side  Being half Taiwanese, I love spicy food.  Came here on a recommendation of a friend and was not disappointed.  I was given this tip though, stick with the entrees and don't go for anything that could be considered a side dishes.  The entrees are where it's at when it comes to this place.  We came with a group of about 10 so we were able to try many dishes.  The standout dish for me was actually the fish soup.  It comes in an earthen pot and set on one of those portable burners.  You get a ton of fish per order.  The soup is a perfect blend of spiciness and saltiness. Seriously, if you come as a party of 2, just order this and some rice and you're good to go!!  I was late joining the group so most of the dishes were ordered by the time I got there.  There was a fried green bean dish which was pretty good. I personally ordered a chicken with walnut dish. It was well done.  The chicken was crispy and spicy on the outside and tender on the inside.  The portions were a little on the smaller side.  I counted about 15 bite sized chicken pieces in the entire dish.  It's about the same for every other dish.  Not too big a deal but if you're a big eater, you might need to order a little extra than you usually do.  All in all, i like this place.  If I'm craving a spicy soup I know where I'm going.  If you like food on the spcier side, you should give this place a go."}
{"text":"Typically have the hot oil and fish dish with the spicy pulled chicken.  Close by and pretty tasty.  This place is open really late, and has been a steady go-to option."}
{"text":"This restaurant is hit or miss. There are misses and there are hits, but firstly thank goodness there is a restaurant that is open until 5:00 am in a city where everyone shuts down and goes to bed at 8:30 or whatever (hello local barbecue restaurant that puts the chairs up on tables at 8:30 in gleeful anticipation of closing at 9:00).  Misses: all dumplings. Skip these here. They are not special. Moreover, I half suspect they buy their dumplings elsewhere frozen or ready-made.  Hits: tofu dishes. They have tasty tofu dishes. Preserved vegetables with noodles and crab dishes of which they have several.  The restaurant makes its living off its specialty, which is spicy food. With that said, they do have non-spicy and mild dishes, which are marked on the menu or rather not marked with a pepper icon.   The waiter and waitress were polite and friendly so no issues with the service there. The atmosphere is quite bland and other than a thankfully off television and a fish tank do not expect any decorations."}
{"text":"My family had been coming to Hot Taste restaurant everything they crave for some spicy Szechuan food. I would say it's my 10th time here in the restaurant and the food is consistently pretty good. It's difficult to compare places if everything on the menu is just spicy!  They're open until 5am so it's one of the better choices for late night eats (either this or pho next door...yuck)  I'm not sure if it's the style of Schzuan food but I find all their dishes are particularly greasy.. especially  fish cooked in chilli oil.  If you want cheap beer, Hot Taste offers for $3.50 for a bottle of domestic!"}
{"text":"Hot Taste Restaurant Opens till 5 AM everyday!?!  I am not really sure I can handle all these Hot and Spicy food after midnight. But this restaurant have been in business for years and seems to be quite popular with the younger crowds!  Maybe we didn't order the right food?! But what is the right food to order?!  Beijing Style Cucumber ($5.50) - nice and crunchy, quite refreshing! Pork Lungs in Hot Sauce ($7.99) - lack garnish and the taste was one dimensional Roasted Chicken ($12.99) - nice smokey flavor but was hard and dry Szechuen Style Hot and Sour Noodle ($4.99) - more sour than hot and why all these ground pork?! and no garnishes?! Portion though was huge!  Everything was a little off or missing something.   Service was slow with just 1 waitress working when we were there.   The restaurant is quite small and the noise level can be quite high if you have a rowdy group. I must be lucky as there was a group of 10 young people talking on top of their voice... I had a headache at the end of my meal...   Maybe that's why everything was off??   I won't be coming back unless nothing else is open in the area...."}
