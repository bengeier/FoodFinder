{"text":"I had New Ho King delivered.  I did not/do not/do not plan to go to UT.  Those things said, and understanding there may be some ambiance-related pieces I am missing, the food was not so good although delivery service in both depth of menu (its like a road map of food....just keeps on unfolding) as well as open hours was impressive.  I would not totally rule out ordering here again...but it's going to have to be pretty late at night and probably a push between being conscious or passed out when the food arrives."}
{"text":"Rude, silent sullen wait staff.  No hellos, eye contact, thank yous or goodbyes.  I've been there a few times over the last couple years.  Good food of the old \"Chinese Canadian style\".  Good prices and portions. The day staff, a couple of middle aged ladies aren't much better than the all male late night staff.  I won't be returning.  And for this I tipped properly."}

{"text":"We were visiting Toronto (my wife, mother-in-law & our 3 small children) and wanted some good Chinese food, so we asked some locals.
A young man at an information booth recommend this place (New Ho King). We ordered a dinner for three, and some pork dumplings also. Everything was good, and potions were large. We had enough food for 6 adults! 
They don't take credit cards so bring cash."}
{"text":"Ok so for this one i'm a lil biased. This is my family's primary dining spot..and no wonder's why. This authentic cuisine is just a joy for your lovely tastebuds! The go to dishes are the Deep Fried Calamari, Beef Chow Mein, Deep Fried Stuffed Tofu, seasonal green vegetables and Beef Tenderloin Chinese Style Sizzling Platter, just to name a few. As for the service it can vary from good to mediocre depending on the time you're there. Late night dining gets a lil crazy. I give New Ho King a 2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Agree with other posters who stay away because of the rude staff and management. Won't order from New Ho King again after yet another nasty experience dealing with extremely impolite people on the other end of the phone. Perhaps the key to a good New Ho King experience is to follow the lead of those who go when so inebriated that they won't even remember the terrible service."}
{"text":"Ordered some food for delivery. They were pretty fast - the food was still hot. Huge portions and the price was ok.

We had some appetizers, then some beef with veggies and spicy sauce, and fried rice. One dish was enough for 2!"}
{"text":"It's delivered Chinese food from downtown Toronto, you can't order with super high expectations. Our delivery guy was super nice and he was very pleasant, food arrived 90 minutes after ordering which was a very long time. They were cooked and they got all of our orders right - we are a-ok happy with what we got. 

Here are what we got and my comments 
106. Hot and Sour Soup - standard 
205. Deep Fried Shrimp Balls (6 pieces) - my non asian coworkers liked them 
213. Pan Fried Pork Dumplings (4 pieces) - meh, not very good 
601. Moo-Shu Pork served with 8 Pancakes - it was great!!! my favorite dish 
S16. Spicy Crispy Shredded Beef - too dry and too fried 
S4. Buddha's Feast - not good
S15. General Tso Chicken - standard 
1003. Ho King Special Fried Rice - standard 
812. Rice Noodle with Beef in Black Bean Sauce - it was alright"}
{"text":"lots of sauce, alot of rice, and not alot of meat. that pretty much sums up my experience at New Ho. Yes it's open late, and yes you can eat +tip for under 10$, but there are many other choices in Chinatown than New Ho King. I found a pebble in my food which cut my tooth. I ended up not paying for the fish, after spending alot of time explaining how i DID NOT ORDER ROCKS IN MY FOOD. Thank god, I would have been in the red if I have to pay the extra 6$. 


Ya.......have a good time?"}
{"text":"We stopped in while passing by in search of a place to have dinner. There was a lot of people and the prices seemed reasonable.... but totally not worth it.

We ordered the hot and sour soup, eggplant and garlic and kong pao chicken for two people.

The hot and sour soup was not that great. While there is plenty of ingredients, it was basically all sour and not spicy at all. So soup is a pass for sure.

The eggplant and garlic was way too sweet and had way too much sauce. The eggplants were beyond drenched in sweet sauce and the eggplants were borderline mushy.

The kong pao chicken was not spicy at all. While there was lots of peanuts, water chestnuts and tender chicken, it was way too salty. 

The servers pretty much ignored us for the most part. Even when trying to get the bill, the one male server didn't seem to respond to our request and just walked away (it wasn't that busy, place was less than 1/3 full when we tried to pay so no excuse for his behavior). And the servers wasn't able to answer very simple questions, like if the chicken dish would be sweet or not, I get it with language barriers but it was a simple question that they should know)

I found that this place most likely catered to Westerners, as that is what the majority of the crowds are. If you want authentic Chinese food, go elsewhere in Chinatown, where they don't mask the flavors with a lot of sauce, salt or sugar."}
{"text":"I ordered from them on justeat.ca, the food was delivered 20min late and the driver was very rude, I added decent tips but apparently wasn't enough for him. And he had the audacity to ask me to tip him more! I would never order from them again."}
{"text":"New Ho King is one of my go-to Chinese food restaurants in Toronto. 

The food is consistently pretty good (I'm a Shanghai noodle fan), the portion sizes are plentiful, and the prices are reasonable. They also deliver fairly late and have a pretty large delivery range, so much so that I've only eaten takeout/delivery. 

It's not fine dining, but if you're looking for rich sauces and good value with flexible hours, New Ho King is a good bet."}
{"text":"Well the dilemma I'm having on rating food in Toronto, a city of such a diverse culture, was that I don't really know what standard I should use to evaluate food. Canadian or Chinese? 

This is why I don't really write reviews on food that I'm not familiar with. I don't want to mislead anyone before I'm sure at least I know a little bit about this food or someone who knows the food were accompanied. It bothers me sometime, when you look at yelp ratings, people are rating food on price or freebies they got rather than food itself; or people who have never had real certain kind of food claiming that certain places are definitely \"not authentic\" because the it's different from the fake ones they had before, it's very misleading.
And for those who don't know: No, authentic Chinese food never have complimentary rice with its stirfry dishes unless its a combo.

Sorry for the off topic bitter words, but it's been killing me.

For New Ho King, I'm just gonna say this, it might be good for someone who has a Canadian stomach, but definitely not a good place for Chinese stomachs."}

My first impression from the delivery man was, \"I was trying to call you since you didn't add a tip (through delivery)\".  I was going to tip him cash at the door but that was an interesting greeting.  Next I opened the package and there is a wonderful shoe print on the lid of my take out container. That does not seem too sanitary. I decided to take a picture and post it.  The food may be okay, but this is my first impression and that is why I gave it one star."}

Had a few things on their menu, never disappointed. 
Try the crispy chicken wings and shredded beef. (But not delivered, taste great straight from the kitchen but looses crunch in transit)."}
{"text":"I have not been back to this restaurant in years and was pleasantly surprised to see it renovated. The toilets are clean, which should please patrons used to some of the other locations in Chinatown which make it task to even wash your hands in some cases! 

My family ordered the 2 lobsters in ginger and scallion sauce for $32 and an order of eggplant with garlic sauce without the meat. The lobster is cooked very well, with a sauce that doesn't overpower the lobsters. The eggplant dish was the unexpected hit of the evening. It comes in a semi-spicy/sweet sauce and it went very well with the lobsters.

I plan on returning soon."}
{"text":"If we could give this place 0 stars, we would.  We ordered General Tso's Chicken, Shrimp Fried Rice, and Spring Rolls. 

The chicken was not edible, the fried rice was old and we asked for two sauces for each dinner and was charged extra.

To make matters worst, the food was bland and expensive; the delivery took over an hour an a half (our hotel is less than .5 miles away from the restaurant), and  my wife was up all night with indigestion which made the selection of this eatery  an epic failure.  


We strongly advise you to save your money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"A chilly Wednesday night.  11:00pm.  Stomach is growling.  What the hell do you go to eat?

Why of course... the answer is very obvious:  Chinese food!  

Now begs the question, who is the reigning king of late night Chinese food?  There are many to choose from in the Chinatown district.  But to me, they are all contenders.  The only logical choice is The New Ho King!  There is no question in my mind that they are the undisputed champion of late night MSG gorge fest.

Don't mind their horrible neon signs and white plastic bag covered tables, because this place knows their food (look next door, and you will notice the restaurant is empty).  Speaking of the white plastic table covers, it is actually a really efficient way to clear off the table for the next group hovering over you while you stuff your face.  Watch and learn.. you might even want to do this for your own crib.

OK let's stop fucking around.  Time to discuss food.

Sweet Chicken Corn Soup!  You should always start your meal here with a bowl of this stuff, especially in the winter.  When they said \"soul food\" I am pretty sure this is what they were referring to (who is they? I don't know)

Chicken in Hot Pot?  Oooh yeah.  Ask for it for bone in (mixed dark & white), or bone out and white meat only.  Both are excellent.  Nicely caramelized on the outside, tossed with cooked down scallions.

Beef with rice noodle, dry style.  Come on.  Smokey, beefy, salty... if you don't like this stuff, there is something wrong with you.

Deep fried Calamari!  Yeah.. that is the shit!  Order it extra spicy for even more kick.

You also can't pass up on their Cantonese Chow Mien.  Super crunchy fried noodles, topped with chicken, shrimp, pork and squid.  And even some vegetables.  Every food group covered.  Done.

Mapo Tofu.  Order it vegetarian.  It owns!  Nice classic schezwan flavours here.  Lots of tofu.. so it might even be good for you.

Shrimp in Lobster Sauce.  Drizzle this masterpiece on all over of your.....

TNHK's fried lice.. sorry, rice, is also legendary status.  Really, get whatever you want.   Beef, chicken, pork, mushroom, vegetable... it's all good in the hood here.  They even have something called fukken riced rice.  Can someone try this and report back?  Tks.

Don't be shy and order a couple bottles of Tsingtao beer for everyone at the table, because you will need it at the end of your meal after all the grease and salt you have consumed.  

It's so bad... but so damn good."}
{"text":"There are better places to eat in Chinatown. The decor is great, but that's the best I can say about this place. Service is very slow and inattentive. The food took much longer than it should have to arrive. The food itself was average for Chinatown but more expensive."}
{"text":"I'll make this short....This place is sweet and sour.

Food is good....

Service is absolutely disgusting!!!!! There is/was no expectation of amazing service. But without getting into the jist of it, I have never experienced anything like this....It ruined the good food that I ate.

I will order out and pick up, because I do like the food...But will never eat there again!!!
And a forewaring, expect the abuse over the phone when calling in as well."}

{"text":"Worst delivery service. Took two hours for food and driver demanded a tip. Don't order from here"}
{"text":"One of the best late night places in Toronto.  Great place to get authentic from multiple traditions. You can order off of the menu if you know what you are after."}
{"text":"They moved!  Two doors down south.

And what do you know?  It looks 100 times better.  Yes, 100 times!  No more plastic bag on tables.  No more bathroom stank.

Food-wise, I agree with everything Neil T. had said.

Try the sizzling spicy chicken.  It is insanely good.  Those little crispy rice thingies?  Sprinkle that on your fried rice.. it is DELICIOUS!

Caution:  Avoid if you are breaking out.  You will probably have the mother of all zits.  This is one greasy spoon."}
{"text":"When I landed back in Toronto after spending the summer in Alberta, the first place my friends took me to was New Ho King. That experience was alright, but this place gets four stars for their late night delivery service! New Ho King has long been a favorite for students at U of T (downtown) and I can see why:

1) Good chinese food in massive proportions for cheap
2) They deliver until 5AM good for those all nighters at the library
3) The service is so fast your food is still hot when it gets there
4) Delivery charge is only $1 plus tip for orders under $20CA
5) They deliver there so often that they're even familiar with the U of T lingo, which ads to the quality of their service."}
{"text":"New Ho King is probably one of the most popular restaurant on Spadina strip in Chinatown. There's a line that forms at the entrance for people waiting to get seated around evening time. That's a good sign right?  Not exactly, it  doesn't necessarily mean that everyone eating here knows what good food is. 

The restaurant spans two levels, from it's apperance it's trendy - see some exposed brick on one wall, the furniture is a dark wood laminate tables. Makes you honestly do a double take ..  am in really in Chinatown?  

Well Yep I am .. the service here is Terrible!   With a capital T. Any request seems like a chore..  Please hide the fact you're happy. And why are ya giving me a sour face. It's just a bowl of rice we asked 2 times about..

I feel like the customers treated here are merely a dollar sign. You see your waiter to take your order. They serve it, when it's ready it is expertly thrown on the table like a curling rock. They get you the hell out so they can do it again. slapping those bowls and chopsticks on the table for the next ones. Many times I had felt disgruntled employees in Chinese restaurants -- ive never felt it so strongly until coming here. 

They serve up Cantonese cuisine with some Canadian twists. To my delight they had a favorite of mine that I don't see that often. Almond So Guy. Breaded like lemon chicken but with a tasty almond gravy sauce.

We had ordered that together with a sizzling beef tenderloin. I was pleasantly surprised .. the dishes were made very well. So we rounded up some friends to try this place for a pre-Chinese New Years celebration. Raving to them on how good this place and downplaying it being in Chinatown and the unfriendly service.

Well second time around it was garbage. We were red faced throughout dinner, constantly apologizing, we stopped ordering food after 3 dishes cause the quality wasn't getting better. It was plain terrible.

Almost got into an argument with a waiter because they were trying to pass off a dish as something else.. why lie?  Because we have a Caucasian guy at our table and we are all speaking English?  Doesn't mean we don't know what we are ordering or understand what you're saying behind our backs. If we need to bust out in native Cantonese.. damn we will.

Anyways first time we visited we forgave the service because the food was very good. This time I don't know happened?  Completely not worth it and such a waste of money.

Cost is a little higher than competitors around the area but NHK have no problems filling the seats because of the nicer interior appearance compared to other Chinatown restaurants. 

But be warned, you fend for yourself here with crap service and food quality depends entirely on who's the chef that night."}
{"text":"Haven't even eaten my food yet but the rudest staff I've ever come across. Tried to order to pick up but was hung up on as I couldn't understand the lady who ended the conversation with \"we're too busy, come and order in person\" and hung up the phone. I did go in person about 15 minutes later and there were 7 people in the entire place.... Placed my order, same lady who answered the phone, attitude was still massively present! Basically threw my food at me and walked off. 

If you want to be treated like a dog, eat here."}
{"text":"\"The one with L50, Spicy Pork Chop on Rice.\"

Good:
Late night delivery till 3AM; wide variety of foods from their night menu (if it hasn't changed, there should still be at least 50+ items); free delivery for a total order greater than $10 subtotal (if you're a UT student presumably living in a UT residence); relatively OK service speed (normally 30 minutes to 45 minutes since your call); delivery guy can be very friendly (depends on who it is); CHEAP!

The Bad:
GREASY!; delivery guy can be very unfriendly (depends on who it is); make you never want to eat that overly-priced already-paid for residence food again (if you're living at a residence)

Overview:
Ah, New Ho King. I don't even know where to begin...it's offered me so much \"sustenance\" for the past 3 years to the point where I was bestowed the title of \"New Ho King\" king in my first year as an undergraduate living in residence. Yes, I had New Ho's THAT much. Why? My residence food was THAT bad. Thankfully, I have a hyper metabolism so I don't gain the least bit weight. In fact, I'm probably under weight? 

Anyway, I hate to admit it but this was the only reasonable option that we residents had since we often didn't want to or have time to go out. It especially helped that during all those all-nighters when nothing was opened at 2AM in the morning and you'd be hankering for some good ol' greasy Chinese food. Yes, the food is greasy and yes you're so likely to have a stomach ache in the morning and yes it's horrible to eat a full course meal at 3 in the morning...but who cares? We were students (=. 

The prices are pretty reasonable, with most of their late-night menu foods priced around the $5 mark. I remember in my second year I created a table using MS Excel that calculated the after tax prices of all their items along with \"what you should pay\", showing you how much tip you'd then be paying (still have it too haha). $6 after taxes can get you pretty much a good meal (see www.imhungry.ca for their menu).

Recommendations? Get L50, Spicy Pork Chop on Rice (used to call it SPORK). Everyone has had that once in their lifetime as a UT resident. It's that food that everyone recognizes as greasy Chinese food but man is it ever tasty. It's basically deep fried pork chop with spicy peppers and salt served over a box of rice. Not in the mood for deep fried foods? Try their noodles, pretty decent quality and tons of them. Just don't get their BBQ pork chow mein....not saying it's bad or anything but if you've ever had BBQ pork before in your life (and I mean real BBQ pork from a place that serves BBQ Pork, Chicken, etc.), then you'll know their BBQ pork is so artificial in its taste. Tastes like instant BBQ pork, if that helps describe it in words. I personally ate L1 (Shrimps in Lobster Sauce on Rice) more than anything else. It's not what it sounds like (you don't get pieces of Lobster), rather it's minced pork in some lobsterisqe saucy served over rice. Get this if you like having white rice mixed with some sort of sauce. I've pretty much tried out everything on their menu sometime in my life but I think these few are those that even if you've had them for 3 years, you can't get tired of them (=.

The delivery boys are well...it depends. Sometimes you get this really nice skinny Asian young man who's very polite. Generally everyone I know tips him well. On occasion you get this not so polite Asian man who one time stared at me and asked \"That's It?\" when I gave him a 10% tip, which I think is pretty reasonable considering I ordered from them nearly twice every week.

If you want, you can go dine-in although you wouldn't get the late night menu since that starts at 10PM. You can still order them, but they're about $1 to $2 more expensive. Overall, NHK saved my life for the past 3 years and if you're in the mood for cheap, greasy Chinese food downtown and aren't picky with what you eat (if you're a UT resident then you won't have any problem with being picky at all), you can't go wrong with New Ho (nobody calls it New Ho King except the guy who answers the phone)."}
{"text":"I've never actually ate at the restaurant itself, but back in those University days, me and my friends always order delivery from New Ho King. Nothing's better than stuffing yourself with greasy Chinese food at 3:00 in the morning, taking a break from studying. 

They remember what address your phone number is associated with so you don't need to repeat your address every time. Service over the phone is abrupt, and the delivery time usually does not surpass 20-minutes. I've had them deliver to Robarts library so many times, they think I live there. 

The food is really A-OK. I've never gotten food poisoning, which is a positive note from a restaurant in China Town. My usual order is cream of corn style chicken rice - they never go wrong with this, and comes out pretty consistent. 

Tip: If you've moved, remember to tell them your new address. They've mistakenly delivered my order to the library once when I was actually in my dorm - lesson learned! 

Now that I've graduated for a while, I strangely miss these 3:00AM deliveries."}
{"text":"i had eggplant with minced meat with rice. 

Huge portion, but mostly because they give you ridiculous amount of rice! There are still quiet a bit of eggplant, good, but not impressive."}
{"text":"Came to check out this place with my dad at 10pm after being ravenously hungry for a few hours. Great Hong Kong restaurant-style cooking. Sauces are a bit shiny and gelatinous if you are into that thing (it's *not actually* full of gelatin, moreso corn starch). We ordered off the lunch+late-night menu. For 6.50 a plate, the spicy garlic eggplant and spicy homestyle tofu both came piping hot on top of rice. Big portions too. 
The tofu was the deep-fried-on-the-outside yet silken type. It was perfectly savoury and spicy. The eggplant was a bit sweet and perhaps a bit greasy for some people, but the texture was firm. I would def come here again."}
{"text":"This place is awesome for after bar food - I have honestly only been here once when it wasn't after midnight.
Try their spicy calamari it is absolutely DELICIOUS! No other calamari I have had as of yet even compares.
Also if you aren't that hungry ask them about half orders - they won't do it for everything but for a lot of the menu they will!"}
{"text":"There's an ancient Chinese fable of The Frog in the Well.  Everyday the frog wakes to his life within the damp well and he stares up from the only spot where light touches at admiration to the sky above it.  The sky is a circle to him with the occasional passing cloud and even less occasional moon. To the frog there are all but three stars in the sky.
One day a pelican rests at the edge of the well and the frog greets him.  The frog expresses his admiration to the beautiful but little sky there is.
\"Isn't it beautiful the small patch of sky?\" The frog says to the Pelican.
\"Yes,\" The pelican replies.  \"But the sky isn't a small patch, it's endless and vast!
\"No it's not!\"  The frog protests.  \"The sky is a small round patch, I watch it everyday and night from where I stand!\"
\"From where you stand it is a small patch my friend, but from the outside it's another world!\" The Pelican insisted.
\"I don't believe you, show me!\"  The Frog demanded.
The pelican swooped down and took the frog into it's mouth and out of the well, the only world he has ever known, and flew him out into the open.  
The pelican opened its beak the frog was stunned.  The endless patch of blue and green and other colours, the frog looked about, taking the new world in.  The frog realised how little he really knew about anything, and from that day forth the frog never again returned to his dark little well. 

New Ho King is that well, and the frogs are the UofT students who know not the world around them, but insist on returning to their damp little hole in the ground believing that this...THIS is what Chinese food really is.  
Open late, like the tireless well which water can be tapped at any time, it is the acne on the faces of kinesiology students at St. Michaels college, the crumbs on the floor of the all girls dorm of St. Helga's, and the grease in the hair of those fine a$$ Trinity College heiresses!

New Ho is a pretty good place, but know...KNOWW this.  That there is indeed a bigger world!"}
{"text":"Cold AC and good and large cheap lunches. What is not to like?

Better decor than most places on Spadina to boot."}
{"text":"Three girls came in here for late-night, after bar food. It was pretty packed!

Here's what we ordered:
General Tso Chicken - 3/5
Cashew Chicken - 4/5
Chicken Balls - 3/5
Beef & Broccoli - 4/5

They add a 15% gratuity automatically, and then charge tax ON THE GRATUITY. How about this - if I want to tip you, I'll tip you. But I shouldn't have to pay tax on the tip I leave. Consider this, if I didn't have to pay tax in my gratuity, maybe you would have gotten a 20%+ tip. Because I was so pissed about this, we didn't leave a single penny extra."}
{"text":"It's really 3.5 stars.

I have been spoiled living in Markham most of my life and surrounded with good Chinese restaurants both in Markham and Scarborough. But, New Ho King serves decent Chinese food in downtown.
Not once have I ever stepped into the restaurant and I don't recall even ever seeing its storefront on my occassional visits to Chinatown. I was just desperate for some late night delivery when I moved dowtown last year and that's how NHK came into my radar. Since then I have tried a variety from their menu and I also have my usuals... Here's a few:
- Preserved egg and pork congee
- Beef brisket noodle soup
- Deep fried calamari with spicy salt
- Deep fried tofu with spicy salt
- Beef black bean sauce noodles
- Shrimp with snow peas
The food is definitely A-Ok and keeps me full for days. Sometimes I have to 'McGyver' the food, adding some fish or soy sauce and cook my own brown rice, but it's enough to settle my cravings if I don't get a chance to go back to Markham.

I usually just call-in when I order, instead of online, since the late night menu is not available. The food comes 45min - 1 hour, piping hot and containers are full.
NHK has reliable delivery and late night eats. +0.5 star for delivering Congee especially when I'm sick."}
{"text":"IMO, is one of the better restaurants in Chinatown for late night delivery or takeout.
However, service is generally shit. In my experience when ordering by phone, the guy on the other end sounds very unpleasant and often rude. Reminds me of Seinfeld's Soup Nazi.

So for me:
Food=      5 Stars
Service=  1 Shitty ill-mannered Star"}
{"text":"I probably wouldn't have ended up here on my own, but I was visiting friends who liked it, so I ended up here. It's pretty average American Chinese food. The dishes I had were tasty enough, but not spectacularly exceptional. In a city as great as Toronto, you can probably do better."}
{"text":"Down shifting this place to a 2 star after my recent return to visit the KING...

Pfffttt King of MSG to be exact. Dear lord!

I never have adverse reactions to MSG but I woke up totally dehydrated, fingers and face swollen and on the verge of being sick the morning after. 

MSG = Mounds of Salty Garbage.

I think it's safe to avoid this place now, even if you've got the munchies, the aftermath on your system is far too great.

Still feeling sick 3 days later.... wont be back"}
{"text":"Exactly what i want from a spadina restaurant.

the new location is nice and clean and the food hits the spot perfectly.  We normally order the schezuan beef, beef fried rice, cashew chicken and the chicken corn soup.  everything tastes great.

loses one star because the service can be painful at times.  I normally don't care much about the service but sometimes they're in a huge rush, sometimes you don't see the server for 30 minutes, sometimes you wont get drinks for 15 minutes and they're always kinda rude but i think thats just the demeanor, no offence intended.  its kinda all over the place

still one of the best Americanized Chinese restaurants for food."}
{"text":"Not bad but not great either.  I got their beef with rice noodles and soya sauce.  The portion was massive and the dish had lots of good wok hei or smokiness which was nice.  But the dish wasn't evenly hot and some bits of beef were chewier than others.  Service was indifferent and kind of abrupt but after reading reviews here beforehand, I knew what to expect."}
{"text":"It's a great late night take out or delivery place. The dinner for two meal easily provides us with 4 meals. The portions are great and it's tasty. It's not gourmet but what you'd expect and it's satisfying."}
{"text":"Am I saying that their wonton soup is the best I've ever had? No. (In fact I wouldn't recommend that dish.) Am I saying that this is the height of Chinese cuisine? No. It most certainly isn't. However, when you're hungry and 2 or 3 am, and looking for hot and salty and greasy this is EXACTLY where you want to be.

Picture attached, came to $80 for everything. Not cheap, but where else are you going to get a full meal like that at 3 in the morning? So wrong, but so so right."}
{"text":"With the change in weather I was down to for the count and craved some hot soup and grub. 
Unfortunately I had a weird sleep schedule thanks to the fatigue and combination of cold medicine when I woke up most  places I wanted to try were closed already.
Never mind the online delivery service to the rescue. I went through a few menus and selected this spot for delivery. I ordered two dishes a medium size serving of hot and sour soup and Chinese style beef tenderloin. Ordering was effortless. The food arrived earlier than expected. 
First the soup. It was big serving and can easily serve 4-6 people. Tons of tofu and egg drop. Unfortunately taste was ho hum not enough hot neither enough sourness. 2 Star at best. Even though packed well it was bit cold and I had to nuke it up again.
Beef tenderloin was actually decent, kept nice and warm and not greasy. 3 Stars there. Portion can easily serve 2 people. So I am all set for 2 meals and then some with the huge serving of soup. 
With the convenience of late night delivery I would give this place 3 stars (one of the better chinese delivery places I have tried)"}
{"text":"The last time I had New Ho King was Thanksgiving weekend, 2002.  How do I remember such a specific date?  Because I have never had such bad food poisoning in my life; and as I lived in University residence at the time, I was all alone in the dorm, on the brink of death.

It's been ten years, New Ho King, and I decided to give you another chance.  We've both changed, moved on, and grown up a bit in that time.  

As everyone else says, the real positive to New Ho King is the late delivery time.  I ordered delivery as it was the only thing open at the time.  It came just over an hour later, about 15 minutes past the time Just Eat told me it was going to arrive.  There's an odd $1 delivery charge, too.  Seems random.  The food was just very normal -- nothing I would crave, all the dishes had the same underlying taste even if they were different dishes.  They all needed something extra, so I had to put a lot of condiments/sauce on.  Portions are gigantic, but that just suggests the quality is poor (a lot of bad food instead of a little good food).

I would order again, because nothing else is really open, but I wouldn't if any other place was available.  And I gave an extra star because I didn't almost die this time."}
{"text":"Update: Still Bad, why do I keep coming here....

The General Tso was super spicy and extra sugary. The Chicken Fried Rice was dull and the Mu-Shu was also bland.

So bad"}
{"text":"My mouth waters just thinking of this place. Really affordable prices, open very late, and ginormous portions.

Defo recommend the black bean sauce. 

If it wasn't socially awkward I'd lick my plate. However that'd be weird."}
{"text":"When my ego gets out of check and I need to be taken down a notch (usually while intoxicated), and I get the hunger I end up at New Ho King.

Their staff gives me the kind of cold treatment that I come to love when I am drunk late at night at a cheap chinese establishment. Like another reviewer quoted \"yu ready\" \"whachuwant\" \"ya\". This is why I tip. I love the indifferent treatment. No honestly. I also like when your food comes they toss it on the table in a \"I dont give a crap\" manner.

I usually get:

Crispy Spring Rolls
Braised Tofu 
Side order of Crispy Noodles
and sometimes if we're really drunk and hungry the Hot & Sour Soup.

This place isnt a good place to go sober. It's a great place when you're loaded tho!

Tip: They have a late night menu which is signifigantly cheaper than the normal menu. When you go in they will always give you the normal menu no matter what time. YOU MUST ASK specifically for the Late Night Menu items on there have the dish and rice for around $4-5."}
{"text":"this is the perfect 5 star rating restaurant. The food is really good, I know because my parents own a Chinese restaurant. All the dishes was well mad, not too greasy and presentation was great which is rare at restaurants in china town  

with the renovation the place looks and feels really good . Even with all this the price is ridiculously low. So you can expect a line up during busy hours. The staff has been super friendly and fun.

this will be one of my top choices."}
{"text":"Had dinner here earlier today with the fam and I'm thirsty, very, very thirsty. Food tasted good at the time. Looking for greasy, tasty, cheap Chinese food with loads of MSG then this is your spot! I think they scaled back the MSG a bit for us already too after my granny asked them to go easy on it. Not going to lie, sometimes I just crave it, but often regret it later. I much prefer my Richmond hill Chinese food. Cleaner up this way too."}
{"text":"I am generally not one to complain about customer service but I am never eating here again. I forgot my personal notebook inside when I went here for lunch yesterday, and when I realized this 10 minutes after leaving I called to confirm that they had it and would hold on to it for me. Earlier today, I came to pick it up. Every used page was torn out of it and then shoved back between the two covers in a haphazard way, with some pages missing, most notably the first page which contained my name and contact information. So much for all my ideas, thoughts and reflections from the past two years. Anyone who writes regularly in a Moleskine or diary will understand why this is so infuriating because it's not \"just a notebook.\" And they had the audacity to hand it to me in a take-out bag (as if I wouldn't notice what had been done to it) without saying anything. The food at New Ho King is average and the prices are very attractive, but guard your belongings. I am going to try to sort the pages I got back (I dated each entry) and get them bound to form a new notebook."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch. Stood at the entrance to survey the floor-plan. It's a relatively narrow place, but it goes all the way to the back with an upper floor and the kitchen in the lower floor. Stairway to washrooms hidden around the corner.

After finishing my look-around, no one came to greet me so I just helped myself in.
There seems to only be 2 wait-staff, and they're pretty much just whatever about things, which is alright this is the kind of place I'm used to. One of them was standing there eating a bowl of noodles. Yelp asks if there's waiter service. I'm going to have to pick \"not sure\".

When asked about seats, one of them just looked around and said \"just take the big table\", which is pretty nice considering the alternative was a really small table in the corner. I think service-wise, at least they're giving me a good seat and not being stingy about it.

* * *

They've got a lot of menus: lunch menu, take-out menu, regular menu, late-night menu, etc. If you're looking for the lunch menu you may have to ask for it if they don't give it to you. Or maybe I was at the big table so they expected me to notice the stack of menus across the table or something.

Lunch options feature all sorts of combinations of meats or vegetables with rice, starting at $5.95; the kind of price-point I like.

* * *

I ordered the Hunan Beef with Rice. The portion size was quite large for the price, however that's about the only good thing I can say about it apart from the light show. The dish was amazingly glossy. Like literally, it was shining!  I can't remember the last time I had meat or vegetables that had such reflectivity.

Taste just wasn't there. The only thing you can taste was salty sauce. The beef was cooked through all the way and it was so soft that I wasn't sure whether I was eating meat or not.

* * *

If you need emergency rations to last you several meals at an inexpensive price, you might consider getting food from this place. Or, of course, if you're a student at UofT and need something at 1 AM since they offer free delivery for UofT students on $10+ orders...

Note that I only tried one dish out of the hundreds that they offer, and this was on their lunch menu as well, so I'm not sure how the more expensive options might be."}
{"text":"This is my fav restaurant in Chinatown.  I was also a fan of Lucky Dragon when I was in undergrad, but New Ho King is where we usually grab our takeout nowadays.  The new interior design is pretty spiffy and they're very efficient.  If you call in an order they need 20 minutes to have it all ready for you.

I find the food particularly greasy and not in a pleasant way.  In general, it is okay.  If I'm craving cheap Chinese food then I'll order from here.  I just do not really find any of the dishes flavourful or overly satisfying.  That being said, we order here about 4 times a year and have done okay.  The late night menu is another story - you cannot go wrong in that department."}
{"text":"Ok- I have never literally stepped inside this location.  Nor would I ever.  This has long been known as the greasy spoon of all of chinatown.  Cheap, hangover (or hangover-preventer) kind of food.  If I were in the neighbourhood I doubt I would ever CHOOSE this place.  But do you know what this place IS good for?  CHEAP DELIVERY.
Yes, we succumbed.  I NEVER eat delivery.  I think it's kind of lazy and fat.  (don't ask me how I can describe \"delivery\" as \"fat\"--but I just did.  I just imagine it to be the kind of thing obesity is made up of-- and I mean the practice in general, no matter what the actual type of food is)

Anyhow, we decided we were lazy, we wanted a cliche movie night, and my friend is a huge fan of just-eat and all those other delivery services.  So we tried it at my place and I have to admit it was pretty okay.  

Yeah, it's greasy as hell
But they will deliver it free, courteously and the food is still HOT when it arrives.
Steam up some white rice and you have a cheap feast for under 40$ for 4-6 people, or many many meals.

I highly suggest you also make a side of broccoli or some sort of steamed veg to accompany whatever you order because this meal needs to be watered down with non-oil things.

Menu Reccos:
-Shanghai noodles (they aren't well done..but I love the wok-fire taste)
-Eggplant (This is fairly on par with any eggplant you will get even at nice places.  Yeah, maybe there is a ladle more of grease here...but you can't really tell amongst the delicious mushiness of the eggplant.
-Stir fried beef anything.  I usually go ginger-beef.

I think if I ever walk in here in person I'll never want to do take-out again.  
So I will stay blissfully unaware and keep it as an option for take-out when I have fatties to feed and all I got lying around is some rice."}
{"text":"I usually don't get delivery from Chinatown since I live so close, but I was at a friend's house at 11:00 at night and had a hankering for some sodium. I have never been to New Ho King before but saw the listing on Just Eat and the fairly good reviews on Yelp and had to give it a try.

We ordered the Dinner For Three (inexplicably $37.95 on JustEat.ca, since it is listed as $34 on their website) which allows you to choose a soup and three dishes, and comes with veggie egg rolls and a generous portion of steamed rice per person. We chose the chicken and sweet corn soup, Hunan tofu, veggie chow mein, and sweet and sour pork with pineapple.

I hear the soup and the sour pork were good, but being a non-meat eater I was left to the other 2 dishes. The Hunan tofu was lacking flavour but generally fine. The chow mein was mushy and looked like it had been sitting there a while.

The delivery was right on the time promised (50 minutes) but the food wasn't warm when it arrived, which was a bummer.

I would give 2 stars but the late night delivery bumped it up. I would probably order from here again, but not the same dishes."}
{"text":"To be honest with you, I have a love-hate relationship with this Resturant. 

Don't get me wrong, their food usually tastes really good but not all the time. I've had two bad experiences now, whereby the food absolutely had no taste. 

However, it still remains my all time go-to Chinese delivery. 

The service is okay, well at least from what I gather on the phone. As I have never dined in before. I always get it delivered to me.

Overall, I would recommend this place to you. The food is usually worth it"}
{"text":"Très bonne nourriture mais très mauvais service non courtois. Je comprend pourquoi le pourboire est inclus...."}
{"text":"Amazing food. The chicken corn soup is the best I've had. The sugar beef is fantastic. They always treat us very well every time we come"}
{"text":"Usually I would refuse to believe that you can tell a New Yorker about Chinese cuisine, but as it turns out, I have been told. Being curious about Toronto's Chinatown and in the mood for some good Chinese food, we ventured over to Spadina Avenue and found New Ho King. All I can say is \"wow.\" This place is excellent!

The menu is extensive and offers a familiar array of Chinese favorites including soups, meat dishes, dumplings and noodles. I ordered a spicy chicken with peanuts stir-fry, which may very well be the best Chinese dish I've ever had anywhere. It was fresh, had just the right amount of spice and the flavors were awesome. The portion was literally the size of my head, so dishes here could very easily be split, but at this price, it's fun to order a couple things and sample. My friend ordered the General Tso's Chicken (the dish by which I judge all Chinese restaurants), and it was like nothing I've had before. The sauce definitely tasted like it had cherry juice in it to me, and it was delicious. 

The only odd thing about this place is that they charge $3.00 for a side of rice, but hey, the prices are all really low, so what can you do? The place is pretty cafeteria-like and brightly lit, but was crowded with actual Chinese people (good sign) and the service was super fast and friendly. Overall, highly recommended and I'm definitely looking forward to coming back here."}
{"text":"BAD DELIVERY service and the food arrived 45 minutes late and COLD.  I called the restaurant twice and both times they were rude.  

The inside of the bag was all wet and saucy, it's a big mess and very unappetizing.  Worst thing is the service.  Food is ok, not that amazing.  Portion sizes are good, average."}
{"text":"My experience with these guys is primarily through ordering online.

Their quantities are massive.  Their food is greasy.  Their prices are reasonable.  Their cuisine is fast-food Chinese.  Their delivery time is average.

In broad strokes, that's all you need to know about New Ho King's food.  So if you want massive quantities at a reasonable price, and aren't concerned so much with greasy food, then that's your place.  Off-the-bat I'd think that it's a good match for students.

Personally, I'm more concerned with getting Chinese that isn't incredibly bad for me.  Luckily, having ordered enough from them, I've discovered a tasty order combo that is reasonable, price-wise, tasty and somewhat healthy.

Get the Beef Egg-Drop Soup as a starter and the Steamed Shrimp/Calamari for your main.  The starter is great soup in massive portions  and the main, well, great steamed food in quick generous portions.  Sure, you might say \"It's just steamed, how good can the main be?\"  But they put some tasty sauce on it so it's something I can have pretty much every day and not worry about my dying young from a heart attack.

I'm going to give this place a 4/5 stars.  Sure, it's a bit high for a fast-food Chinese place, but it's not going for Cordon Bleu haute cuisine so give it a break.  Perhaps if I check out its neighbors and decide that other places do it better, like \"Sky\" across the street or Rol San down the street (so far I've only ordered the dumplings at Rol San) then I'll downgrade them.  

In any case, I figure that if all they had was the Beef Egg-Drop Soup and the Steamed Shrimp/Calamari, I'd give them a 4/5.  Those are things I can eat every day and, really, if that's the case, do you really need more than two items?  The rest is just gravy...  Greasy greasy heart clogging gravy..."}
{"text":"Bad tasting food and really ugly service.
This place has only one good thing. The prices for the portions and that is it. Went with tye family for the first time and it was the only time I would ever visit this resturant. Food was greasy and not flavoured at all."}
{"text":"New Ho, you were almost a perfect 5.
I remember the days I ordered from you in undergrad. You saved me from starvation with your delivery. Long nights, clubbing, and exam sessions, you're always open.
Always satisfying, filling, slightly greasy but Oh so so good.

You provided me with CHOICES. Many choices even after 2am. You also gave me these choices for 5 bucks? Really, you are too generous. Have I ever told you that? Well, you really are generous. Along that line, you always give me so much food, more than one person should ever eat in one sitting! I always manage to finish most of it, but you are evil, these are big portions for such little price.

Evil and nice I guess...
BTW, since you moved, I did start trying canton chili. The prices are the same and the portions are big too. I don't want to offend you. It's just that, they are nicer there. The service is good and they know me, by name! I know, I haven't given you enough time to figure that out but still, I didn't give them much time either.

But in all honesty, I still do like you most. I'll stop Canton. I'll do it because you guys do it better. The music you play is nice, the atmosphere and seating is nice and the food is just delicious. Flavours are consistent and portions don't change. I like that in you. You're reliable. I really like that.

Just do me a favour, learn my name. One day, sooner or later, you'll get that fifth star. I know you will."}
{"text":"Delivery was prompt, had wonton soup (excellent broth) vegetarian chow mein,  shanghai style fried noodle and chicken fried rice. So your basic greasy joint order. And it was just so delicious. Not too salty, fresh, fresh, fresh veggies and noodles were perfectly prepared. Nothing but a delicious authentic Canadianized chinese meal! And was an even better left over, none of that greasy layer from crappy cooking oils or pieces of protein becoming too chewy. People this is important when you are getting comfort food!!!!"}
{"text":"My go to Chinese dining. The service here is one of the best and the food here is extremely tasty."}
{"text":"Everything New Ho King has, Canton Chilli has next door but with relatively better service and cheaper delivery. Well, except maybe online ordering. 

I came here once for late night hunan chicken on rice and the food was pretty decent with good portion. However, the waiters seemed like they had nothing to do and were incredibly impatient even though I was the only one there. I was reading something on my phone when they went to grab my plate still with plenty of rice and chicken without asking and before I was even done!"}
{"text":"It is with feelings of bittersweet joy that I sit down to write my review of NHK. For the past year and a half I have been making monthly treks to Toronto visiting my friend.

Inevitably it would be late at night/very early morning and we would be hungry and what else is better at 3AM than having dinner and a floor show? Anytime after midnight, you are pretty much guaranteed to see something that will make you talk about it later. One visit my friend witnessed a bachelor party in the back with more food on the table than I could shake a stick at, and the guys too drunk to even notice. However, that's isn't really important in the long run, what is important is that we never had a bad meal here. Not once in 6 visits totaling more than 8 hours sitting, enjoying the day. She loves getting the Shrimp in Spicy garlic sauce with Eggplant, and the crab corn chowder soup. I am a huge fan of the Cantonese style beef on a hot plate with onions. Between us we've eaten a lot of things on the menu and didn't even make a dent on being able to say we've tried most of it. But we did enjoy all of it.  

However, what I think I will miss the most is the entertaining service that comes along with your meal. We nicknamed one of our favorites \"Mr Happy\" it always brought a smile to my face when I would walk in and see him just as pissed as ever hating his job to the point of it being funny. Here's an actual conversation that took place between us and him.

He walks up to the chair a the table beside us (Mind you we were in the front leftmost table up front) put both hands on the chair and stretched his back much like a cat does upon waking up. He stares at the ceiling for a second and then it starts. 

Him - \"You ready yet?!?!\"
Us - \"Yeah\"
Him - \"Whachuwant!?\"
Us - \"Cantonese beef on a hotplate and pork chow mein\"
Him - \"Ya!\" 

Takes his hands off the chair, back straightens up, and he walks away. We were quite flabbergasted but also laughing our faces off at the same time since we're fairly laid back at 2AM. Since I didn't want a Katana through the heart I didn't bother saying much, but this incident did lead to the founding of \"Mr. Happy\". 

I see that I am just babbling here, so to sum up, here goes. There is nothing amazing about the atmosphere here it is simple as it is effective. Get a seat, give the order, eat the food..There is nothing fantastic about the service or prices, you'll get water, tea, and the occasional refill. Servers know what things are in case you see something on a table you like they can help you identify it.  The food is great tasting, the hours are perfect for night people, and it's always a good show late at night. I will truly miss eating here a few times a month."}
{"text":"Classic example of a restaurant who've been in business to no longer have to impress you. Is the service good? No. To be quite honest anything past 2am your service will not be with a smile, did they try? Kind of! Was my food good? Yes. Was everything good for the time and place? Yes. You go new ho, just try to remember your roots every once and a while. :)"}
{"text":"Probably my 10th time coming here in as many years.  NEVER disappoints.  Not freaking exaggerating in any way, shape or form.  Chicken balls.  Trust.  Really, anything.  Trust. Language barrier only adds to the awesome authenticity and sweetness of the people that work there."}
{"text":"Take out cause reviews weren't bad,#4 for delivery in our area of Toronto. 
Well, not sure who is making these reviews. BUT. Worst soggy wonton soup with starchy no flavour. Hot and sour soup tasted like vinegar. 
General tao chicken so hard like rock, and again no flavour tasted like cornstarch. 

Fried rice mediocre, and beef and broccoli, beef soft and ok, broccoli like mash potato. Must have been from frozen 
Sorry to say this is worst Chinese we've ever had, mall food is way better. 
Stay away"}
{"text":"Leonard just about has everything covered on his review below.  I've been a regular at New Ho for about 10 years now, rarely ever going before 'it is time' -- post-bar between 2:30 and 4am.  

What they say about the late night menu is true.  You get all of your favorite New Ho dishes served with rice for a fraction of the regular menu price.  

My favorites include: 

- Spicy squid: a must for a starter, the perfect blend of deep fried, spice, and salt.  Party in my mouth.
- Hunan chicken/beef on chow mein noodle: a spicy symphony of spicy meat of your choice with onions and green pepper served on a crispy bed of egg noodles.
- General tsao chicken: another spicy and sweet dish of lightly breaded chicken, best served on a bed of rice.
- Lemon chicken: who says bright yellow sauce is bad for you?
- Sweet and sour chicken balls: my dish of choice whenever I feel in a 'damn I wanna be white' mood.  An excellent ratio of chicken to batter, deep fried to crisp perfection.
- Chicken and green bean (in black bean sauce): probably my favorite dish.  This is an awesome display of greasy green beans and chicken stir fried in a black bean sauce.  I think that the beans are flash-fried in oil because a vegetable can't be this greasy without outside influence.

Easily the best spot in Chinatown to get late night food.  They also deliver, but the food isn't as good (especially the squid).  However, items like the Hunan noodle is even better the morning after.

**Thanks for making this the ROTD!  I am honoured!**"}
{"text":"New Ho King. Their food was good, but I'll never eat from there again.

Like I said... won't be going back."}
{"text":"At 3:00 AM around the College and Spadina intersection, the only things open are a 7/11, a Burger King, a pharmacy, and this place. If you find yourself in one of the first three at three in the morning, chances are that something has gone terribly wrong. Perhaps you find yourself suddenly bereft of tastebuds, thinking of eating 7/11 pizza, or having imbibed an unholy amount of alcohol, desirous of putting what can only charitably be called a burger into your digestive tract. Or perhaps you are in the pharmacy, and something has, in fact, gone terribly wrong. 

Stop! Go to New Ho King. The food here (from the late-night menu) is cheap, greasy, and comes in enormous portions. It is served by waiters who appear to have truly grasped that there is no meaning of life. The food is delicious, in the way that greasy Chinese food is while drunk or lacking in sleep. Afterwards, you will feel a unique mix of satisfaction and self-loathing. The fortune cookies take the edge off the self-loathing, however.

{"text":"How does the toilet paper roll get dirty? Don't use the bathroom unless you want to ruin your appetite.  Couldn't even wash my hands.  Was the first customer of the day at four when they open so they could have cleaned the place.  The crispy beef is drier than the service."}
{"text":"I saw this place had a 3.5 star average and ordered delivery. It wasn't until well after receiving the food that I decided to notice that all the reviews got worst over time, and otherwise come from people posting about after hours experiences when dining on chinese food at obscure hours.

I on the other hand, ordered delivery off Just-Eat and despite quick delivery time, everything else was a let down. The spring rolls, were hands down the greasiest spring rolls I've potentially ever eaten. Deep fried wontons were perfectly fine, but those are kind of hard to screw up. The General Tsao Chicken was some of the blandest I've had. Worst yet, the Singapore Curried Rice Noodle was absolutely brutal. You can tell that they use a powdered curry instead of a paste, as the food was literally gritty with powder as if it hadn't been mixed up and cooked enough.

If Im drunk and its 3 in the morning like everyone else who seems to like this place, maybe Id consider this again... Otherwise, nope."}

We only got 3 dishes:

1. Corn soup with crab meat - stay away!! Once we opened the lid, our whole hotel room was filled with a foul crab/fishy smell. I was courageous enough to have a tiny taste of it. The crab is definitely not fresh which caused the smell. After that we threw it away. $10.95

2. Beef tenderloin Chinese style - almost like a sweet and sour beef without the breading. The beef was soaked in baking soda to make the beef extra tender which was kinda gross. The beef became chewy  like gum and lost the real beef taste. $17.95

3. House special fried rice - only decent dish of the 3.  Nothing special. $10.50

Total came out to be around $45 and we threw in $5 for the tip (not knowing the quality of the food). As you can see, $50 got us a very expensive fried rice and chewy meat."}

There's really no reason to go here, unless you're looking to save $1 on your takeout (as it is quite cheap). There's approximately 100 identical restaurants within a 1 minute radius that are worth the extra $1 they charge.

The food: below average. I remember eating beef that barely had the consistency of cooked meat. 

The service: They really have no reason to care about you (and don't). This place is packed with a lineup midnight-4am, making a killing off drunk people

However, the employees are really rude. I work in a restaurant, and I know it can be stressful at times, but treating customers as badly as New Ho King does is really unacceptable. I've been to several Chinese/Asian cuisine establishments in the city and have never, ever come across such awful treatment of customers. It's really quite deplorable."}
{"text":"Great for what it is : cheap delicious Chinese food. Their hot and sour soup is amazing as is their Shanghai noodles. Don't expect ambiance or a beautiful restaurant, just amazing food served fast. Our server was fine and helped us pack away our extras. You get way more dining in than taking out but they deliver really late which is awesome."}
{"text":"Fried lobster here is great, as is the steamed fish. I really like the food here, but the service is pretty lackluster. Disinterested waiters basically. Great place for take out, but not amazing for dining in."}
{"text":"In a word: disgusting. Ordered delivery on a Sunday. Website says free delivery, they actually charge $1. Chicken balls were overcooked, falling apart and tasted terrible. Pork chow mein was horrible. Half the noodles weren't even cooked and the whole dish just tasted disgustingly greasy. Veggie egg rolls tasted like nothing, which was kind of a step up from the rest of the meal. Icing on the cake: they didn't even give us any fortune cookies. Threw most of it out.

Do yourself a favor and order from Bamboo Buddah. Would have ordered from them but they took the day off."}
{"text":"New Ho King is your standard China Town Chinese restaurant. They have a wide variety of standard Chinese cuisine at very good prices. Biggest plus is that they deliver (VERY late into the night - might even be 24-7 for your Chinese food cravings - although delivery might take a while)

For this reason, most people who have New Ho King tend to be UofT students, cramming late nights and realizing at 3 a.m. that they forgot to have dinner! 

Unfortunately their food is EXTREMELY greasy and you`ll find that if you manage to finish their rather large portions, you will be left with a bit of a stomach ache.

Regardless for the price of the food and the convenience, it is not a bad option for chinese food at 2 in the morning or if you`re walking around aimlessly after a drunken night on Richmond street."}
{"text":"The food is good quality and authentic.  The spicy fried calamari is one of my favorites.  The Chicken in pineapple nest is another one worth trying. The place is simple and clean , food is tasty but can't bring myself to say much for the service. The best way to describe the service is that the servers do their job without being nice or friendly."}
{"text":"The food was ok... some of it was actually better than ok... that said... 
The service was terrible.. very unfriendly, very unaccommodating, inattentive..
The server had to be called as they did not come around.  That's fine, he was a hand-wave away. Unfortunately, when he did come by no smile, i felt like i was interrupting him from his standing around clowning around with his buddies.
The staff all appeared to be just hanging around like they were on recess at school.  The food was ok, but i'm actually wondering what happens in the back at the kitchen... do they have the same level of professionalism in the back while preparing or cleaning... my only hope at the end of the meal was that i wasn't going to get food poisoning... 
To an ironic twist at the end... mandatory 15% gratuity, even though we were a party of three... what happened to the old New Ho King?? were you only good for delivery???"}
{"text":"Their food isn't so bad.. it's what you expect .. late night greasy Chinese ..it's consistent .. a tad pricey and needs an overhaul on what customer service is.. they are all about the mighty dollar and treat you poorly .. many other places where it doesn't treat you poorly for speaking English ..   new ho needs a new king if you ask me"}
{"text":"Service says it all, came here late afternoon and the server was one that I had dealt with on previous occasions.  Minimal interaction, can't be bothered with attitude.  

We ordered plain fried rice, what we got was egg fried rice.  I knew it was different from what I had ordered on previous occasions but my dinning companion was happy with it.

If I had change I would have left less than the 20% tip we ended up leaving."}
{"text":"I wish I could give it 0 stars. The worst place I've eaten in a long time. The beef tenderloin hot plate was covered in dark, red  sugary sauce. We ate it by scraping off as much of the sauce as we could and having lots of rice with it.  The orange duck was inedible, bright orange covered in syrup. We took one bite each and I had to take it out of my mouth. The wonton soup was warm, not hot. Wonton filling was good, wrapper was soggy."}
{"text":"The only reason to go here was \"cold tea\". 

And the decision to go normally hinged on the level of alcohol already in your system.

If you're actually looking to eat, there are at least 4-5 better places in Chinatown at any hour of the night.

If you want some recommendations, I can \"name names\""}
{"text":"The most underated restaurant on yelp. This place got me through my college years at UofT. Back then, it was 5 dollars for the lunch special/late night special, and a dish could last me two meals. Came here for the cheap eats, and my fix of Chinese food. Is the service good? Not really. Is the place sanitary? Most of the time. Do they get yellow carded? Sometimes. But the food was good,  the portions were large, and it was cheap.

Now however, they have increase prices to around 7-7.50 dollars a dish (even during the late night special!) and with tax and tip it comes close to 10 dollars. I want to give them a better rating, but a simply cannot after they raised their prices.

If you come here (though be warned again of the price increase), I would recommend the Hunan Chicken or Beef on Rice series, or the chicken and vegetables on rice. The kung pao chicken is also good.

So long New Ho King, though I still reminisce and have fond memories of making an order at 1am when I'm in need of greasy chinese food. Those were the days, at 5 dollars a dish..."}
{"text":"I got food poisoning from here on May 28th, 2017, 36 hours of hell. Don't eat here period. Many infractions, check dine safe toronto.com. Zero stars."}
{"text":"ate here last night with old friends and new..., crammed around a little table, and slow service but it was all worth the wait... General Tso Chicken and  something not on the menu that is possibly one of our new favourites... Scallops with Ginger and Scallions.  It was a non stop line up out the door for the two plus hours we there..."}
{"text":"New Ho King is like an abusive boyfriend. Although they treat you like crap, you somehow always go back in hope that they will treat you better the next time. We use to go there for late night meal/snack and YES we know about the Special Late Night Menu after all these years! So please stop hiding it from us every time and make a sour face when we ask for it. Being rude to customer is probably the main priority when they hire their staff and if you know how to stare down customer with a cocky face when they ask you for something, you'll be hired on the spot for sure! The good food won't even make up for the nasty service. It's time to put my feet down and cut you out of my life. Goodbye New Ho King, I'm officially breaking up with you after years of abuse!"}
{"text":"My friends and I used to frequent Kom Jug Yuen across the street but sadly they closed last year. :( We've been looking for a substitute go-to spot for Chinese food and so far this place has been working out pretty well. Their huge serving of General Tso Chicken easily serves 2-3 people if everyone also orders their own side of steamed rice. Place is clean and service is good. It's also one of the few places in the neighbourhood that isn't crazy crowded on a Saturday evening (i.e. 6-8 p.m.)."}
{"text":"Found a clothes pin in our soup...legit clothes hanging pin.  

I witnessed customers telling the server their food didn't taste so great and his response was \"if you don't like it eat somewhere else\". Questionable.."}
{"text":"One of the best late Chinese restaurant, it's really cheap if you ask the 9pm menu, for 5-6 dollars you have a big (for real tho) plate. 
i love the sweet and sour pork, this is the bomb!
i tried the calamari but it was just impossible to take a bite.
i have mixed feelings for this place, you can go with something really good or for something really bad! 
As for the service, it's meh, some waiters are really unfriendly but one of them ( the one with the glasses) is usually nice. So i think it depend of which one serve you.
I will probably go back because of the cheap prices!"}
{"text":"Big shooting outside this place last night - two or three people killed :( hope that it stays open."}
{"text":"Renovations well overdue!

NEW AND IMPROVED
wow! The place looks so much better with the new top to bottom renovations. It just feels cleaner now. The lazy susans are part of the table instead of ontop of the table. I find them hard to turn but I guess it gives the place a cleaner look.

The place is narrow though and I found myself being hit by people walking by.

FOOD
The food taste the same. meh

PARKING
They still have free parking in the back!"}
{"text":"Poor customer service. The waiters have not good customer service when I tried to ask them for a glass of water. She turns and goes away and from far side asked me what I want. Employees start talking loud and don't care about customers. No polite at all. The two start is just for food quality."}
{"text":"I cant tell you how many orders of Chicken and Black Bean sauce I scarfed down from this place during my U of T years.  I dont think i have ever had such a fond connection with a crummy little chinese restaurant.

I spent 4 years (yes, i graduated in 4 years, assholes) of my life completely entranced by this place.

Just seeing the sign of the restaurant makes me want to cry greasy tears of drunken nostalgia.   Im sure it comes as no surprise to any of you that i have a very spotty memory about my college years, but of the memories that do remain, about 50% of them incorporate either eating at New Ho King or getting delivery from New Ho King.

No joke, i have seriously had dreams that i was back at this place crammed into the little table next to the filthy aquariums spilling piles of rice all over myself while drunkenly trying to figure out what i was doing with my life.

To me, hese dreams are better than erotic dreams.  Well, they kind of are erotic dreams....but thats a whole other issue and this is neither the time nor the place.

I love you New Ho King."}
{"text":"Quite literally the worst restaurant meal I've ever had. This includes any street trucks, hotdog stands, mall food courts, even the most 'challenging' street meats eaten during travels. This beat them all. 
Between the 'crispy beef' dish (more like deep fried Cracker Jack) to the needlessly grumpy servers to the bad timing of serving, to the not-at-all-fresh appearance of everything we got. 

We left our plates nearly untouched when we asked for the bill. When our server asked if we wanted to take the food home, we declined, though this did not seem to raise any kind of alarm or question from them.

Though I wish I threw up afterwards, no such luck. 

Interesting to sit and watch the colourful nightlife, just make sure you don't eat anything yourself."}
{"text":"Solid food, consistent quality, clean decor. Really not much to say here. Very standard offerings at a reasonable price and the expected huge portions."}
{"text":"Disappointed with the food. Large portion sizes. Used just eat for delivery which was fine."}
{"text":"This is the place to eat for late night greasy Chinese food.  This is even good for dinner or even breakfast! :o)

But seriously; 3am Chinese never tasted so good.

Recommendations: Spicy Calamari, Beef with Baby Bak Choy; Ho King Special Fried Chicken (In a sizzling pot) will keep you coming back

Favorites:  Fish Maul Soup; Baby Clams with Black Bean Sauce; Grouper with Black Bean Sauce on a Sizzling Platter; Shrimp and Snow Peas.... the list goes on and on"}
{"text":"I live near Chinatown, and I was always timid about going to places because I never knew which place was good, as there are so many! I was really excited about trying this place as I had high hopes, but I was extremely disappointed. BlogTO rates this place as 7th best chinese food in Toronto. If this is the 7th best Toronto has to offer, then we are in trouble. The dumplings in the won ton soup were overcooked and falling apart. The beef tasted chewy and the sauce on it left a weird mouth feel. The egg rolls were tiny and cold. The sweet and sour pork was what you would expect.... but hitting 1/3 on expectations is a pretty bad score in my book. Cooking chinese food is not like baseball!

This place is terrible. Buy frozen wing wong from the store instead. I would not go back."}
{"text":"Wow!  Stumbled in here  by chance and got a HUGE lunch for $6, plus tax and tip.  About $9 in all. The service was lousy, but the food (L7: Grouper and Tofu) was delish.  They also give a cup of soup and a veggie roll with yummy sauce, plus a pot of tea!  All for six bucks!?  The service was terrible by Canadian standards, a tad below average for a Chinese owned & staffed place.  Based on the reviews, I'd probably avoid coming here when it's crowded, on a date, or with finicky souls.  But for those of us big on appetite and small of wallet... the New Ho King is a mighty fine joint."}
{"text":"I seriously have a love-hate relationship with New Ho King. During my years as a student, I ordered devoutly from New Ho King as they offered cheap take-out at 2am and the portion sizes were huge. That being said, I always had a problem with the service because it's probably the worst service you can get. The person who answers the phone is always super rude, and the delivery people aren't any better. The last time we ordered, it took 2.5 hours for us to receive our food, so we only tipped $5 (which isn't bad at all for a $20 order). I gave the delivery man $30 and asked for $5 back, and he seemed really angry at the $5 tip. Then he swore at us and spat at my door, which really borderlines harassment. 

Long story short, New Ho King is good if you want late night take-out for a reasonable price, but be prepared for the bad service (and have change so you never have to ask for change back!)"}
{"text":"my favourite after bar food place is rol san for chinese.

But one day, i was convinced to come to new ho king. I have gone back many times since this one night. 

and it changed my life.

1) Finally, a place that actually serves this elusive 'cold tea'

2) So cheap and such large portions i regret never going here during uni

3) I actually bumped into Thievery Corporation here. For real. It was insane. I bought their dinner bill without even thinking about it."}
{"text":"We love New Ho King. The portions are HUGE and food is always tasty. I've eaten at the restaurant, gotten delivery several times and even placed an advanced order and the delivery and service was always prompt.

At the restaurant, expect average service (like most in the area)

We've gotten soo many things from their menu: fried rices, spicy calamari, lemon chicken, sweet and sour pork, vermicelli noodles, we always eat and have tons of left overs

We are never dissapointed."}
{"text":"New Ho King is where the party continues -- and not just in your mouth.

Where else can you saunter (stagger) in at 2, 3 or 4 am and still quench your insatiable urge to continue the swilling simply by asking one of your snazzy hairdo'd waiters for a pot of \"cold tea\"?  If you don't mind drinking \"tea\" that smells like barley and hops way after last call -- this place is for you.

If you're NOT an alky and just an admirer of cantonese cuisine, then this place is also for you.  Truth be told and all things considered -- New Ho King is the hands down best Chinese restaurant on the Spadina strip.
There.  I said it.  And its true.  They've never been red-signed like Swatow, they don't overdo the garlic like Rol San does and any other contender on the strip just isn't part of the conversation.

Too much grease?  Perhaps they lay it on a bit thick but if you're ordering fried noodle Cantonese Chow Mein -- what do you expect? 

The staples are good -- Shrimp and Lobster Sauce over white rice, the aforementioned Cantonese Chow Mein with the noodles deep fried to just the right crunch and even General Tso's and Sweet and Sour Chicken Balls for those of you whose knowledge of chinese cuisine extends not far past Manchu Wok.

New Ho King really shines when you go off the beaten path.  The Spicy Beef is shreds of beef rolled in sugar and pan-fried -- bet you didn't know that beef could be a candy.  The Spicy Salted Seafood is like the Treasures of the Sea from Full House -- sea scallops, shrimps and squid deep fried with chilies and dusted with sea salt.  No wonder there's always a full house here.

Finally, my favourite -- and you won't find this on the menu -- but the guys will know exactly what to give you if you ask for Chicken with Black Bean Sauce over Crispy Fried Egg Noodles.  A frankenstein mish-mash creation that is the result of a mating between a Cantonese Chow Mein and a Black Bean Sauce dish -- dripping with greasy goodness.

Some more tidbits from a New Ho King frequent flyer:

- New Ho King is the restaurant in the Public Service Announcement commercial currently on TV about Gambling Addiction.  Ironic, since a trip to New Ho King is NEVER a gamble.

- One of the original owners and most popular waiters, Albert moved to mainland China and opened up a restaurant -- he was supposed to come back, but never did.  Want to be treated like family?  Ask the waiters, \"Where's Albert?\"

- Not much of a secret anymore, but if you're low on cash and its late at night -- ask the waiter for the Late Night Menu.  Lots of great choices for $6 or less (including the aforementioned Shrimp and Lobster Sauce over Rice).  

- Probably still a secret and even more interesting -- smile the right way and be polite -- they'll let you order off the Late Night Menu at 4pm in the afternoon.

New Ho King is lovingly referred to by its devotees as simply \"New Ho\" -- but despite the shortened moniker, one thing is for sure:

As far as Chinese Restaurants on the Spadina strip go, \"New Ho\" is definitely, hands-down -- THE KING."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice. First time was in the restaurant after a long day of sight seeing with out-of-towners. Food was hot, fresh, fast and lots of it! We took food home and we all had lunch the next day. Awesome! A couple months later my husband and I do take out and it wasnt nearly as satisfying. I think the key is to eat in house when its hot and fresh. It's definitely worth trying. Also you can't beat the price, totally reasonable. Good for kids and families."}
{"text":"Haven't even started our food, but had to stop to leave a bad review purely on the fact that the delivery time was nearly two hours when they said 40mins and then instead of apologising, the driver just shrugged and told me they were busy and then YELLED AT ME when I told him that wasn't acceptable. When I called to ask if there would be a discount, they only gave us 10% off. Absolutely terrible, not at all satisfied with this service. Don't order from here."}
{"text":"New Ho King Delivers, it seems to be their claim to fame for UofT students since they offer free delivery to U of T.

However the delivery charge was only a dollar when we ordered and so few Chinese Restaurants deliver, so instead of picking up at the usual Swatow or Yeuh Tung, we rolled the dice with New Ho King!

The good:

At 9 pm on a Friday night they delivered within 40 minutes, and the driver was genuinely appreciative of his tip!  The food was so hot we had trouble lifting the containers from the bag!  

The Cantonese Chow Mein was good but needed more sauce and tastier sauce to be great, but had generous portions of chicken, BBQ pork, squid, shrimp and veggies.

The great:

Szechuan string beans with (or without) ground pork was delicious and generous with the meat.  Very flavourful and beans still had crunch.

Deep fried squid in spicy salt had more batter than we expected but it was light and the squid was very tender and the spices were tasty.

Rice noodles with beef and black bean sauce - the container felt like it weighed 5 lbs!  Super generous portion, and if you have ever had this dish before, you know that it is supposed to have a smokey charred taste that I can't explain, but this dish had it and made hubby crazy happy.  Also was generous with black beans which is important for black bean sauce!

The weird and terrible:  

After so many dishes that were good or great, the General Tso was frighteningly bad!  It tasted like dense, tough and dry chunks of chicken in a mystery BBQ sauce, and that sauce was terrible!  

The surprise:

Sweet and sour pork is my test dish for every Chinese restaurant I try.  We were confused when we opened the container for New Ho King's Sweet and Sour Pork because A) it was brown not neon red from ketchup like we are used to, and B) it was filled with giant chunks of fresh pineapple and long clear strips of noodles?  (I still don't know what those things were, they were clear, crunchy and about 4\" long, not much taste)

At first we were frightened but tasting it, the dish was great, more on the sour side than sweet, the sweet was mostly the pineapple, but as long as we didn't think of it as sweet and sour pork it was delicious!


Giving New Ho King four stars as long as I never order that General Tso ever again!"}
{"text":"If it's 3:45am and you're craving the dirtiest grub known to man, this is a sure fire bet to get your grease on. Don't worry, you have the next day to regret your dirty decisions.

If you are in the resto, you'll probably notice it gets pretty busy.With renovations, the place is larger now though, and the place looks exceptionally classier then before.
If you are getting it delivered though, the service gets pretty spotty. I've passed out waiting for them a few times - they do eventually get there though.

As a warning, the menu is deep. Like REAL DEEP! I have no idea how they control their inventory. I've had a chance to try a LOT of their menu, and not everything is good. If you want to make it easy, try my handful of consistent and conservative options below.

Here are my doozie Top 5 late night favorites:

1.Seafood Feast of Shrimps,Scallops & Calamari served in Phoenix Nest
2. Rice Noodle Seafood Swirl ( Ho Fun with seafood)
3.Dry Sauteed String Beans Szechuan Style
4. Ho King Special Fried Rice
5.Spicy Crispy Shredded Beef

Bonus: Beef with Bitter Melon on Rice

TBH - This place is really a 2 star. It gets 3 stars because its open super late, and hits the spot when you want something more then cardboard pizza. Leftovers aren't a bad thing either!"}
{"text":"lol I'm sorry I love me some New Ho King
This is my fav greasy spoon Chinese takeout place
To top it off I always get the same food and love every bite.
Even though we could never finish it in one sitting we still order waaay too much food
Chicken balls, chicken wings, fried rice, Cantonese chow mein, and general tso chicken
All delish, all full of flavour, huge portions, greasy and full of salt, just finger licking good
Well I will admit I did not like the general tso chicken, it was kind of hard and dry inside. The sauce trys to mask the horrible texture and the fact that its probably old /overcooked
but my bf loved it so I don't know
lol My mom would so frown at me if she knew I still eat this she hates the MSG overload
I'm srry mom its late, I'm hungry and most off all my eyes are bigger than my stomach
see attached pics"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of chinese cuisine, and having lived in Hong Kong for a while, am pretty familiar with different cookig styles, flaviurs and standards of service in such restaurants. However, I can say that New Ho King litterally had the worst staff I have ever had the displeasure to meet. They were rude and unfriendly. We asked a question and the waiter just told us he couldn't help us (we just wanted him to tell us what was the ingredient...!). We were ordering food and barely finished as he was leaving. They didn't offer us any water or chopsticks. No cups for the tea. As for the food, it was terrible. Yes, the portions are huge. But the taste? It was terrible. We had the sichuan style chicken with the mapo tofu. The chicken was bland, with carrots and celeris (?!??) and no sichuan peppers. The mapo tofu was also very bland, in a weird thick sauce. Seriously, at some point the staff got their dinner break on the table neighbouring ours, and their food somehow looked authentic, fresh and better overall. We were extremely disappointed with the quality of the food. I mean, if you can't prepare sichuanese, just don't offer it on the menu. And the worst part is, they got the nerve to include a gratuity in the final price, without telling us. When we told them, they offered to remove it right away, pretty much confirming that this practice was pretty shady. Worst resto on Spadina. Will not go again."}
{"text":"Love this place. One of my favourite Chinese places on Spadina Avenue. The pricing is slightly higher than some of the other restaurants in this area but you get what you pay for. Authentic fresh food, clean restaurant and modern decor. My tip? Sit at the back of the restaurant upstairs where the air conditioning works better."}
{"text":"Horrible Phone service - the guy barely speaks english and thinks he owns the place.

He asked me if I wanted sauce on my dish and I asked him to put sauce but not too much, he replied by saying \"can you understand me ? are you crazy\"

Had the food here a few times and honestly it was nothing to write home about 

Ridiculous...... worst customer service ever; if this place wasn't cheap and open late it would definitely fail at being a restaurant.

Not ordering from here again.... EVER"}
{"text":"Good for what it is - a small Chinese place with a cheap late-night menu.

Portions were adequate, food was good, and service, well, you're not going to a place like this for the service. The decor was a notch above what I'd expect.

They have many full dinner items for $5-$7 on their late-night menu.

Automatic 10% tip and minimum $20 order for credit/debit - minus a few points. Be careful not to tip a second time!

I've always found it cold inside. They could turn the heat up a bit.

A few minor issues but a good place overall."}
{"text":"This review is based on my takeout experiences, because I've never actually been in this restaurant (surprisingly). 

But WOW - The moo sho pork here is phenomenal. The portion is huge, arrives in a take out container that's as heavy as a brick, and easily feeds me for two full meals. It's also NOT GREASY which is key, because most Chinese take out (and dine in) can be loaded up with oil. 

I've ordered take out from here 4-5 times (via Justeat) and I am never disappointed."}
{"text":"I must say, New Ho is probably one of my favourite Chinatown spots. Not only because they have fed me when I was dying of hunger at 4 am, but because they have the best hot and sour soup EVER, and because they have a secret late night menu.

Yes, it's a secret, and I don't even want to tell everyone about it, but here goes: New Ho preys on all the drunk idiots who stumble in from Richmond Street at 3 am because they don't know about the Late Night Menu. If you ask for this menu, the server will silently go grab the menu and hand it to you in the least obvious way, so no one else sees. Everything on the Late Night Menu is the same as the day menu, except WAY cheaper.

New Ho is a delicious, Chinese restaurant with the typical plastic tablecloths and pots of Jasmine tea, and they even humour you with fortune cookies (ever since I learned that fortune cookies don't actually exist in China, I've been less enthusiastic about them). It's also the restaurant used in one of the Ontario Government commercials warning teenagers not to start gambling -- the one where all the friends are waiting for the one kid who is still at home addicted to playing Poker. Classic.

Anyway, I'd like to think New Ho is a Toronto staple, so if you're coming here for a visit, give it a chance. And now that you know about the Late Night Menu, you can enjoy the wonderful, greasy food for super cheap. I know. You're welcome."}
{"text":"So I visited New Ho King on a Sunday afternoon with a group of 50 other starving college kids. No joke. We pretty much took up the entire restaurant. 

Did I mention we were all starving? We were ravenous. The menus offered choice upon tantalizing choice and since everybody wanted a piece of everything, we went gung-ho on the menus and ordered one of almost everything. Soon our lazy susan's were loaded up and the restaurant turned into a frenzied feeding ground for hungry Asian college kids. I guess it's safe to say that my dining experience at New Ho King was a bit different than most.

However what stood out for me the most were three things: the food, the price, and the service. Now, anything would've tasted good at that point but I did like that of all the dishes I sampled (I ate so much I can't exactly remember what I ate) nothing struck me as overly greasy or artificial. It was your average, if not slightly better, Chinese food fare. Now the prices were amazing. You could order almost any dish for under $10 and the platter would be huge. Our group of 50 ended up paying about $13/person including tip, and considering the amount of food that we went through, it was worth it. And the service! I was most impressed with this. Imagine, a candy shop overrun with children. We were everywhere. And yet the staff managed to keep the food coming out quick and hot, pushing past our migrating bodies table to table without dropping a thing, and providing us with water/napkins/utensils/etc right when we were in need. We were pretty rude patrons I admit, but not once were we treated rudely in return.

To top off the dining experience? A very funny round table of fortune cookie readings, adding \"in bed\" to the end of each fortune. Good memories."}
{"text":"This place is great. My family has been coming here for years, even when it was at its old location. We know the owners pretty well and we get the best quality foods. I looveee their deep fried squid with shrimps, Sweet and sour pork, Veggies, Duck and taro, and bitter melon with beef and crispy vermicelli!!!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered from them using just-eat at midnight. They delivered within 2 minutes of the expected delivery time. Good stuff. I got the Spicy Crispy Shredded Beef and the Ho King Special Fried Rice. The portions are ridiculous. I was seriously impressed before even taking a bite at that point. The Ho King Special Fried Rice is good but most Chinese restaurants can get fried rice right. I've never tried Spicy Crispy Shredded Beef before at any restaurant so it was a nice surprise. A bit sweet, a bit spicy and 100% deliciousness.The only problem was I didn't taste any beef at all. Just a lot of deep-fried batter. Still, I can see it being a great meal after a night of drunken rowdiness."}
{"text":"Delicious Chinese food. Great place to go with large groups (they have big tables with lazy Susan's for easy food sharing). Cheap drinks, casual environment and tasty food - what more can you ask for!

In the heart of Chinatown, this is definitely a go to dinner spot when on a budget with friends."}
{"text":"The food here was ok. We had the lunch special and it is a lot of food for very cheap. The soup and egg rolls were ok. I had chicken with eggplant and my husband had general tso's chicken. Mediocre. I would have given three stars but the service was so incredibly unfriendly and extremely rude. I do not recommend this place. Customers are treated like an unwelcome burden instead of a guest."}
{"text":"I ordered their Deboned Sliced Grouper with Sweet and Sour Sauce. BIG MISTAKE. The sauce was overly sweet and I felt sick after a few bites. Their fish was just ok. The portion is large (it took me 3 meals to finished this one dish), but because the food was horrible, I had to suffer longer.

Also, the cashier aka whom I placed my order to, was not friendly and quite rude, even. He saw me entering the restaurant clueless (I didn't know whether to wait for a greeting or go straight to the cash register for a take-out), but he ignored me. This went on even when I was right in front of him. I had to take the menu myself. 

Tl:dr ordered a take-out, cashier was quite rude, and food was horrible. I will never come to this restaurant ever again."}
{"text":"For those in a rush:

- DO NOT ORDER FROM OR DINE HERE.
- Numerous health code violations (feel free to peruse DineSafe!) 
- Extremely rude staff (delivery man gave me the middle finger!)
- Sub-par quality food, bordering on inedible 
- This place stays in business from thrifty students and drunk late-night patrons who don't know any better (or care)

I have ordered New Ho King twice, and both times have ended up being an absolute waste of money. 

The first time, although the food was quite tasty and delivery service was acceptable; I found myself sick for a good 2-3 days afterwards. 

Following this experience, I reviewed the health inspections of the restaurant on the city's DineSafe website and (unsurprisingly) came across numerous violations on multiple instances. I swore off this place once and for all, or so I thought. 

A few years later I had a Chinese craving and although I knew better, I decided to give this place a second chance since they were among the few options I was aware of open late at night. 

What a mistake!

Not only was my dish (rice noddles beef and broccoli) literally drenched in grease/oil to the point of being inedible and thrown away, but the delivery man gave me the middle finger when getting a $4 tip on an order of around $20. 

That was the final straw, and I have sworn off this place for life, and told anyone I can not to waste their money (or risk getting sick) ordering from New Ho King. There are a myriad of options in the city you will find far superior!"}
{"text":"Great prices, large servings, and a huge menu make this a good choice. Next time I will look for something less greasy though. They will also deliver all the way to Lake Shore Blvd -that's quite a free delivery radius!"}
{"text":"Mega Salty Goodness. Yes, that does spell MSG. Good catch, gumshoe. 

This is a typical late night place in Chinatown, but it has one huge bonus. It's delivery zone is large and in charge, and they will get your munchies well after midnight. In typical Toronto Chinese food fashion, though, the dishes look cheap but that stuff adds up. 

Lastly, I will leave you with this nugget of wisdom: Good fried rice, bad hot and sour soup."}
{"text":"We drove for 8 hours, got out of the car and ordered some food. That's when it happened. A girl roller-bladed her body into this restaurant and placed an order. It was smooth, it was slick, it was a flashback to times when I thought about roller-blades. 

I thought I ordered shrimp in lobster sauce on a plate but I got shrimp in a bowl of lobster sauce/soup and it was alright. My dinner partners (business partners, road trip partners, partners in crime) enjoyed their meal more than I. 

Then that girl roller-bladed out, dinner in hand and I wished I knew what she had ordered."}
