{"text":"Super good food! Prices are amazing and the chicken tasted perfect.

I highly recommend skipping good ol' Swiss Chalet sometimes and grabbing this. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. For the $35 whole chicken special. 
Comes with 1 chicken, 2 large sides, 2 sauces, 4 drinks. 

The chicken was moist, the skin crispy. 
A good tell of a good rotisserie chicken is a moist breast, and crispy wing tip. La Quina passed. 

The yucca fries were great.  Golden and crispy, and the portion was substantial

The rice was good, but I'd be lying if I said I could pick out all the flavours.  Also, a very substantial portion.  

We received chicken soup samples, which were rich, flavourful and hearty. 

Could the prices be better? Maybe, but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Ordered:
1 whole chicken- $16.99
1 Walk-in special-$5.99
1 poutine-$8.99 large
1 yuca fries-$6.99 large

Service was swift and amicable.
Food was freshly prepared.
Chicken was moist; fries were crispy.
Yuca fries were sweet and salty, first time I had them; very delicious.

Poutine's gravy was not conventional but was very appetizing; worth the price.

Highly recommended for picnic food or office party pot-lock food.

Will definitely come back for catering."}
{"text":"Very good chicken !  I have been to many Peruvian restaurants and this so far makes it to the top list ( for chicken). Plus it is very cheap compared to the others."}
{"text":"Lovely, clean, great food! Service was great, very friendly. Decent price especially for the walk-in special. TRY THE POUTINE.
Chicken was delicious, and was happy to see many peruvian dishes on a short but satisfying menu."}
{"text":"Ordered via just-eat.ca, for the first time & I was not disappointed. We ordered a $34.99 combo which consist of one whole chicken, two large sides (Yuca fries & rice). The Yuka (cassava) fries were amazing & the rice was very flavourful with garlic, cilantro, onion & various spices). The chicken was well seasoned & moist. My whole order was very tasty & satisfactory delivery for a Saturday night (45 mins - 1 hour)! This combo order can be easily shared between 2-3 ppl. I would order again..."}
{"text":"Great food! Had the 1/2 chicken with rice combo. It's very good and affordable as well. It's a new place and location is a bit hard to see at first, hope they make it!! Only thing: would be good to get the food  served on  plates when you eat there or something more practical than the take away boxes you  get the food in now. 
Very good chicken"}
{"text":"Had the walk in special and the chicken tastes amazing! Would have loved a bigger portion on the chicken or rice but other than that it tasted amazing !"}
