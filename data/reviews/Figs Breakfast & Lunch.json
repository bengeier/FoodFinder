{"text":"let's take in consideration for where this place is located.  the closest intersection is at queen st. east, and parliament.  not exactly the best of neighborhoods to the north, but there is some smaller bustling joints around.  F I G S is just one of those!  but don't think \"hoitey-toitey\" coffee joints.  this is a breakfast/lunch places, that exudes neighborhood warmth.  

i've only ever visited here on sunday for breakfast, and i do so, because i'm otherwise not available to, but there is one very biased reason why i do visit.  the sole owner and operator, about one year ago, stopped through the market where i worked, and she was looking for ingredients.  and not that she is a regular customer, but what got me, was that she was searching for quality ingredients, and wouldn't settle for less.  we had a good discussion on food, and it solidified my opinion of what this place was like.  

F I G S has your basic breakfast menu, with waffles, eggs benny, etc., but if you're lucky enough that they have any, there are some really nice homey greek foods, like the chicken and lemon soup.  beautiful way to start a cold winter day!

it's not five star dining,  it's decor isn't one to rave about.  prices are worth what you get.  sunday mornings allow for free parking along queen, but it's family style and warmth are what fills this place up with locals.

would be a 3.5"}
{"text":"i find the service here slow an the people are rude. the food was blan as so my review"}
{"text":"I went here today for brunch, the staff was friendly but unconcerned. The food took so long to come, that I had finished my coffee and water before my meal came, and I was never offered a top-up (nor did I have much of an option to ask because they were very hard to get attention of). The food was mediocre, what you would expect for an average restaurant. I had the Greek omelette, with light rye toast and hashbrowns. 

The part that takes it from a 3star to a 1star - after I paid by credit, I went to use the restroom. When I was leaving, the woman who helped me while paying stopped me and told me my payment didn't go through because their internet went out, even though the machine said approved when I paid. She wanted me to pay again with cash, so I said I would call the bank to see if there was in fact a charge - which they confirmed was. The woman didn't believe me and treated me as if I was a criminal, and made quite an embarrassing scene. My bill was only $13, and I felt she could have handled it much more appropriately - by looking at a totals report on the credit terminal, for example. 

I dont know if they do this often to rip people off, or if it was an honest mistake, but I will not return here."}
{"text":"Went for brunch this morning. Food was alright, but for food that's just alright I expect to pay less than $30 for two people. The club sandwich was quite good, but the soup I had it with was extremely bland and cold when it arrived at the table. My partner had corned beef hash, which was overly salty and very greasy. My primary issue was with the service, which was slow and completely unorganized. For a small restaurant there seemed to be a lot of servers, but none of them seemed to have any direction. We asked for out bill, waited 10 minutes and then eventually just went up to the desk and paid. Not somewhere I would recommend or return to."}
{"text":"Definitely the BEST brunch spot in downtown Toronto. The food quality is excellent, and the portions considerably large for the price. The eggs benny's are delicious, and you get 3 english muffin halves/3 poached eggs, as opposed to most places that only serve 2. The fresh fruit at the end is also a treat to sweeten the palate.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Figs has always been the breakfast spot to go to when we are hungry and just want to go for breakfast. A simple diner style breakfast. I have to confess, I order the same thing all of the time. Where else can you go to get a three egg breakfast for $4?

I've never been disappointed by the service. In fact, I always say yes to the coffee refills and leave shaking. The breakfast always comes out fast. 

The restaurant is clean and you can see the cooks make your food. 

**It's a cheap & quick breakfast spot**"}
{"text":"Oh yes, this place really is a big dill (restaurant pun, don't get it? Guess you'll just have to pay a visit to unravel the mystery). 
     I can find absolutely *nothing* wrong with FIGS; the food is delicious, the portions are huge, the prices are great, and the staff are the best! 
     FIGS is such a warm environment and it's clear that there are many regulars from the way the staff engage customers. But they embrace new comers with open arms as well. 
     I have only been here for breakfast/brunch but this is THE place to be and is hands down my go to. My favourite dish is the classic eggs Benedict, which is served with three eggs instead of the standard two, definitely not stingy. It's served with home fries, but sometimes they'll substitute potato hash for half of the fries. I love the fact that they do this because it shows that the restaurant doesn't have strict conditions and if the cooks want to provide diners with something different, they can and do. The Benny also comes with a fruit salad, which I'm not a particular fan of because of the average quality of the contents that make it look like the side was just slapped together from findings in the fridge, but again, it adds to the homey, quaintness of the place. And with the offering of a side of pancakes or french toast (2 pcs) for $3, how can you not love this place! 
     The staff are amazing! So friendly and they never rush you out. There also isn't just one waiter or waitress designated to serve one area of the dining space, during my last visit, I was probably greeted by each member of the wait staff at least once. I was even offered a refill of coffee after I had paid the bill. They provide small hard candies with the bills for customers to enjoy after their meals. During one visit I was given a handful of sweets consisting of one candy in each flavour, What customer service! I thought; it was just a fluke but this place is fantastic enough without an OCD level of attentiveness.
     Overall, an amazing restaurant run by amazing people and highly recommended. 

Bonus: fresh flowers in the washroom!

EDIT: took off a star for the decline in the quality of customer service. During my last few visits I was given the bill halfway through my meal, usually despite the fact that the restaurant was nearly empty. The added niceties I noticed at first are now gone as well. So while Figs still delivers in terms of food, this place doesn't wow me anymore"}
{"text":"The food is great the chef is really nice and friendly and the servers are really nice. Everything is great except the owner! She has the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE! She's rude. I honestly love this place just not her. I came for breakfast with my friend and everything was going great. I went to pay for my bill and the chef even said Hi to me and first off the owner didn't even greet me I gave her the bill which was $27.12  and asked to put $18 on my debit card. I clearly asked her to break a $20 bill for me. I guess she misunderstood me and didn't want to give the $20 back, I told her this is my friends money and she's going to leave the rest on the table with the tip she just continued to argue with me I didn't even know what she was saying because she was mumbling and I once again try to explain to her why I wanted the $20 to be broken. She finally gave me two $10s and then she had the AUDACITY to tell me to leave the ten on the counter in front of her face. I told her \"do you think i'm going to run away with the money and not pay the rest of the bill?\" She didn't respond. By this time I was furious! I made it LOUD AND CLEAR that I love this place just not HER! Ridiculous I just wanted to come in for a nice breakfast but left with my day ruined by that horrible experience. I seriously don't know what's her issue."}
{"text":"I moved to the area 2 months ago and was absolutely happy to find a breakfast place that was open on weekdays as well just around the corner from me.

Then I ate there and was beyond ecstatic that THIS particular breakfast place was right around the corner from me.

First of all, price is extremely reasonable.  Ranging from $4 for eggs (for those times you are still a little too drunk to eat a full breaky) $14 for a beautifully delicious salmon eggs benny or steak and eggs.

BEST POTATO HASH I'VE EVER HAD.

Personally, I've had the following:

Full breakfast w Belgian waffles, eggs, ham, bacon and sausage with eggs and hash brown. (13)  I'm not a waffle person but man, they were cooked just perfect - a little crispy outside and soft and melt in your mouth inside.  Just the right amount of sweet too!

Classic eggs benny (11) - it's all about the hollandaise sauce!  I don't know if they make it in house, but just creamy and the sight bit of tang that makes it so good.  Secondly, it's about the eggs.  Perfectly poached.

Corned beef hash (special not on menu) (11) - Oh my God!  Their potato hash is incredible to begin with.  But then you add some sweet peppers, onions and corned beef.  Wow.  Was so delectable.  And then you have over easy eggs to break right on top of the hash mound.  My favourite.

Meat Lovers (special) (11) - Was really good ... can't really say anything else about it except it put me in a food coma and it was a Thursday morning before work.

I love this place because the service is quick (turnover has to be as it gets quite bustling on weekends -- they're not pushy about getting you out, though!), they have a large but not overwhelming menu, and a couple specials off the menu to choose from everyday.

I really recommend this place for anytime.  Especially if you're in the area.  But definitely go out of your way to try something new in a new 'hood!"}
{"text":"My experience at FIGS has always been very pleasant with friendly staff and a smiling owner who hugs pratically every customer who walks in the door.  Food has always been consistent and the portions are average to large.  I love the peameal bacon breakfast.  We eat there regularly  approx 1 or 2 per month on the weekend.  Last time i was there, two peameal breakfasts with 2 coffees including taxes cost us $23.  Very reasonabe, i think.  Rob."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood breakfast spot.  The food was all fresh and well executed and the service was friendly and efficient.  Especially liked the  pancakes which were perfectly cooked.  Prices very reasonable.   Note address on queen street entrance is actually on parliament"}
{"text":"The place was a hidden gem. Everything was amazing. Food and service. I had corned beef hash. Wife had smoked salmon. Place is excellent!"}
{"text":"The is one of the best breakfast places I've tried. I've been going here for a few years, and at that time it was one of Toronto's best kept secrets. Their bennies are outstanding. The hollandase sauce is fresh and delicious. Portions are great. You get 3 egg bennies and it's the same cost as most places charge for 2! But I haven't really had any food here that didn't taste good. It must be catching on because lately it's been getting busier and busier on weekends. Try and get there before 11am to avoid a line up. The place is small and can feel a little cramped at times, but the food is soooo worth it. I'm addicted!"}
{"text":"We've been going to the Fig for almost 2 years but will not be going any more.  We went on a holiday weekend and eventhough there were seats available the owner tells us that she's saving those seats for larger groups of people.....rude and not a nice thing to do to your regular customers.  

We went on another occasion and had to return the eggs benedict because the sauce was made with a wine sauce.  When we tried explaining to the owner that due to allergies we couldn't eat anything with wine in it she insisted that it was good and made fresh and for some reason was not getting it through her persistant head and got agitated.  We also told her that we asked the waitress what the hollandaise sauce was made with and that she hadn't mentioned that there was wine in it.  Normally a restaurant should be understanding when allergies are an issue especially considering the fact that the customer asked ahead of time what the meal contains.

{"text":"Food lovely, wait staff nice...owner is a bit rude. Told me they couldnt take mastercard, only cash, visa and debit. I am from the US and i have a mastercard DEBIT which she saw.  Owner ran my card through the machine and then proceeded to point at me telling me, \"i told you we didnt take mastercard, we get charged now!\" As a business owner myself im very aware how you should treat your consumers and even when delivering a bad message there is way and manner in which you address people. As a note to owner you should let your customers know of your payment restrictions BEFORE they are seated to eat at your place OR have a polite sign stating the payment restrictions which is visible for all to see so the consumer can decide whether or not they would still like to dine."}
{"text":"Decided to try the place out. I saw the place was pretty packed so it had to be good... 

Ordered their breakfast special. Eh.

Tomato still had stem in it, tasted grainy as if it wasn't washed.

Water was warm

Asked for salt and pepper, manager or owner grabbed it from the other table (which still had guests fully eating their breakfast. Not to mention she touched it by the top using her grubby hands that recently was cash handling

Presentation was alright, I asked for my eggs over-hard. I've never had my eggs so thin the cooks must have flattened them down while cooking.

Pancake tasted like flour

Bacon was alright... 

Hash brown (potato) was soggy, greasy and oily. I glanced into the kitchen as I was paying my bill and it literally sits in a skillet and is reheated as orders come.

I asked for sugar, again manager took it from a table who was still sitting there and eating. Which ended up with awkward looks all around.

This place needs better management to educate their staff of proper serving etiquette. 

Also, I left a tip for the waitress and she hands it to the manager.... That my friends was the final straw. Never returning. Ever."}
{"text":"i had the worst experience here ever!!! 

i was actually enjoying my meal until i saw hair in my last eggs benedict. i kindly addressed it to the waitress who brought it to the managers attention, she then came back telling me that they can only do a $3.00 discount considering i ate the majority of the food (what can i do if i ate from left to right?!?!).
 
anyways, i would have accepted an apology and went on with my day. however, as i was about to pay and clarify that was the only discount i was going to get the manager then decided to deny that there was hair in my food and was trying to charge me without the discount. so i then asked the waitress to verify if there was hair in my dish and if the manager saw the hair. she said yes. instead of accepting the fact and apologizing to us she decided to blame it on me, the customer. 
her reasoning was that they don't have cats in their kitchen which i did not say was a cat hair. she then tells other customers that we were lying and that we put the hair there ourselves because her hair is blonde, mind you i didn't say it was her hair!! it was about an inch long black and curly.

its really unfortunate that this is the way the manager handled the situation. the food was not bad but management was terrible! i hope no one has to ever deal with this type of rudeness. 


so so unfortunate!!!! because of the way she treated her customers i would never ever come back here again."}
{"text":"Do not bother. Service is horrible. The owner or manger is always miserable n gives you the bill before you are done eating....this happened all 3 times i've been."}
{"text":"My favourite brunch place in Toronto. Exceptional food. Great price. Fair portions. My go to is the classic eggs Benedict but all of their options are grade A goodness! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Eventhough the establishment has changed hands at least 3 times now I believe, it really hasn't changed the quality of the food which is, well, pretty standard breakfast with nothing that stands out as exceptional at all. You can generally always find seats, and the service is pretty fast. I suppose I'd say sure, if you're in the area, want to eat some pretty regular breakfast stuff, a coffee and a newspaper, it's a place for you. Prices have slowly gone up since it first opened, although quality is the same as well as portions. Also it seems a fair number of locals call it a place for brunch and the crowd is pretty mixed. I'd say give it a try if you're in the area, but there are more interesting breakfast places around. All said and done, average food and fast."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. It seemed to bridge the gap between your typical greasy spoon joint and the more upmarket snooty hipstery brunch places. Judging from the lineup outside on a chilly spring day, it seems many in the local community were equally appreciative of what Figs has to offer.

I had the eggs benny with peameal. Wow. Amazing value for money here! For $12, I got three muffins, three beautifully poached eggs and three deliciously succulent pieces of bacon, all covered in a refreshingly light hollandaise sauce. The price included salad, home fries and toast. Fantastic. Easily twice the size of what you'd get in many other brunch places - and the quality was up to standard, too. 

As someone below noted, the orange juice is delicious! It was freshly squeezed and in a decent size glass, and set me back only about 3.50. A nice change from the many restaurants who pour Tropicana out of a carton in a tiny portion and then charge over 4 bucks for it.

The service was friendly, endearing and speedy without making us feel rushed.

This place is doing everything right, and I'm glad an honest, down to earth, reasonably priced cafe is holding its own against the myriad of fake pretentious places out there.

Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"So I was recommending this place to someone and was shocked at the bad reviews when I looked it up. Not warranted, and not just because of the location (it's great by any standard) so here I am again.

My fiance and I popped by this place after checking out the lovely Adornments on Queen, granted we split the pancakes and fruit but the helping was massive even for both of us! Honestly one of the freshest and fluffiest pancakes I've had in the city and for $7 it was more than I could ask for, even if I had it on my own.

We weren't that hungry, but the waitress mentioned that they make their hollandaise fresh and it looked pretty good from the table beside us, I will be going back for that. And I don't know how rude the other patrons on Yelp have been, but not only was the service there prompt and warm, I also loved that the place is packed with regulars. Sweet old people that really seem to love coming there. It was a memorable day for the two of us and I'd definitely come back with my family or a few friends for a nice brunch!

Oh yeah, and very cool artwork."}
{"text":"Service - that's the key. They seemed just don't care. There were 5 workers at least and no one tried to help. I needed more napkins- went to take  by myself. I tried to ask for refill my coffee - it's took me 10 minutes to get their  attention. After my \" thank you\", didn't get any response.  
Meh....
Food was expensive .
Not sure I will come back."}
{"text":"A hidden gem! The owner of this place is so wonderful and so is her family. The food is amazing, great staff and every time I come me and my family are always treated with such kindness. Love coming here!"}
{"text":"Love me some figs brunch. Big portions. Great friendly staff. Delicious corn beef hash."}
{"text":"Figs is still going strong. Delicious food - fresh, tasty, plentiful portions - whether eggs and pancakes or the homemade soups and salads. Bennys, omlettes, waffles and french toast are the best!  Recently l, my friend had a BLT with avocado on a fresh baguette and it was delish. I have been going since it opened as my \"go to\" brunch place and have never, ever had a service issue - always great!! Go. Really. You'll be happy."}
{"text":"Won't be going back.  The eggs and toast were well executed.  The service was awful.  The restaurant door was left open and it was extremely cold.  This restaurant does not have any decaf hot beverages -- no decaf coffee or tea.   The regular coffee is not fresh... We saw them simply top up the pot, adding to the old coffee.  This was evident in the flavour, according to my dining companion who can drink caffeine. 

The french toast was well executed but the menu did not mention that it would be loaded with orange zest, resulting in a bitter flavoured concoction which no longer tasted like french toast.  This restaurant claims to serve 100% maple syrup.  I am pretty sure they are using aunt jemima, as the colour is extremely dark and consistency is too thick to be real maple.  

Grab some candies on your way out though.  They'll hold you over until you make it to Tim Hortons."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Figs for breakfast on Saturday morning. We both had the full breakfast. I added french toast and my husband also ordered  pancakes. He requested blueberries in his pancakes and they were able to accommodate which made him really happy. My husband was extremely pleased with his blueberry pancakes. The french toast and rest of the breakfast was good for the price point. The service was great and the staff was friendly and attentive. The atmosphere was inviting and the establishment was clean."}
{"text":"Great spot! Moved to the area fairly recently and noticed on my walk to work the place always busy. Finally got the time to try it out on Sunday and everything was great! We got in right away which we did not expect on a weekend. I got pancakes (SO fluffy!) and bacon, my boyfriend got the Egg's Benedict, both really enjoyable. Will definitely be going back again."}
{"text":"Overall breakfast is average, price is alittle steep and quality of food is average. Portions are average sized, seems to have alot of customers which means this review may not be shared by oyher, therefore you should try and see if you agree. I ordered eggs benedict, classic breakfast, quisential breakfast."}
{"text":"Hands down my favourite eggs benedict in the city! They put this seasoning on it, I'm not quite sure what it is but it's delicious! The hasbrowns and home fries were good. Service was quick and efficient.I only gave them 4 stars because they placed us at a table right in front of the door which meant freezing our butt off every time the door opened. I don't agree with having a table right there. Other then that great place!"}
{"text":"I love myself a good breakfast corned beef hash. These guys bring it to the next level. I used to visit this place before it was figs. They have taken over and truly put themselves on the map. Great job figs!  My wife and i loved the food and the friendly staff."}
{"text":"Here's the thing - I really like this place and come here frequently. Food is really good. Downfall is the place is small and that caused me an issue today. I was forced to wait because I'm single while groups of two's were seated before me. Plus there were seats available but management didn't wanna lose the potential party of two or more so left me standing waiting waiting ... not cool at all!  Had you seated me at a 4 person table I would have been happy to share my table with a party of two that may or may not have come in after me."}
{"text":"Delicious brunch place. Always busy for good reasons.  Good price and the table turnover rate is fast. You won't be waiting an hour for a table like the places in the west end."}
{"text":"This place always seems to be busy on Saturdays and Sundays. The price for the quality and quantity of food is amazing for Toronto brunch. Although a little bit cramped the atmosphere is pretty upbeat and friendly. 
Staff are very accommodating. My favourite breakfast is eggs Benedict and they do it well. You get three as opposed to two poached eggs and English muffins. The only thing I can say is you need better home fries as they tasted slightly Woody to me. 
I also really look for Caesars on the brunch menu as some Saturday's can be a little bit of a hangover, unfortunately not licensed so not my first choice for a hangover brunch."}
{"text":"Cute and sweet staff. Owner seems rough around the edges but is good with people that seem less advantaged. This breakfast spot is in a rougher area. 
Grilled cheese was made with real cheddar but wasn't melted. Homefries are simple deep fried potatoes. It's a diner. Limited expectations."}
{"text":"I've visited Figs about 10 times in the last three months. The place fits about 30 people. Simple food, quick service and high quality. Staff are polite."}
{"text":"One of the only places in this area to get a decent breakfast. We stumbled upon it by a happy accident. Very friendly and prompt servers.

I usually ordered the eggs benny, and now that Ive moved I still cant find a good replacement. Huge dishes, perfect sauce, excellent hashbrowns. Its usually more than I can eat. Coffee is meh, but there is fresh squeezed juice for a little bit extra. Food usually comes with a bunch of fresh fruit.

Interesting artwork was being displayed/sold on the walls when I was in last."}
{"text":"Short review: kind service, good prices, GREAT diner food, no figs.

Longer review:
Service is quick, kind and accommodating.  Food arrived quickly.   The ambiance is nothing fancy but it's clear they care about this place and have put a lot of love into it.  

The prices are very good for what you get. In fact, I'd say they are a few bucks cheaper than even the most dive-ish places in Toronto. We paid $9 for a big plate with two slices toast, omelette and potatoes.  That's usually around $10 or $11 everywhere else.  I think the plate of  4 huge pancakes was about $7.

The food: definitely way above the average diner breakfast.  The omelet I had was light, fluffy, ingredients fresh and generous.   Homefries were pretty standard but good. But the pancakes - those are absolutely amazing. They are big, fluffy clouds of sweet vanilla goodness.  Not mungy or grainy or wet like so many. No, these are dreamy and they are served with REAL maple syrup (the only acceptable sauce to serve with pancakes).  

I really like this place and I think it deserves to be noticed, despite the fact that they do not actually serve figs."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Figs weekly since it's doors opened and it has remained my ragular breakfast spot since. The price for portion/quality of food is unmatched for what I've found in the city. Service is always top notch as well. If you come on a Sat/Sun you will find the restaurant bustling with a ton of servers ready to take care of you at any time. The turn over is fast so you're never waiting long for a table. The shinning star of Figs has to be the owner Tula. She's there everyday, smiling, ready to make sure all your culinary needs are met. I've brought many friends and family to eat there and they agree that having a place like figs nearby is truly a gem.....One that everyone in the city should find and enjoy!"}
{"text":"It's a delicious hearty breakfast place. Big portion of food but absolutely delicious. I recommend eggs Benedict and French toasts. For two people, a main and a side is sufficient."}
{"text":"Affordable menu, good service and the classic eggs benedict was delicious."}
{"text":"Great place. It's in a small space and its popular, but I've somehow always managed to get seated right away when I come here, even during peak hours. Could be due to the quick service. Food is good and reasonably priced. Especially enjoy the eggs benedict."}
{"text":"Figs is a small, quintessential brunch joint with friendly and attentive service and solid menu choices. There are healthier options like salmon and avocado but I went for the \"big breakfast\"; really can't go wrong with a classic.

The only two downsides are that the front door brings a lot of draft in, and there's not a good area for people to wait which crowds customers eating near the door.

Also, no booze!!  Wanted a mimosa but sadly, no liquor. But, you get 1 coffee refill, and good menu selection.

Would come here again!"}
{"text":"I love Figs! It's much better than its previous incarnation, although along the same lines of food. The breakfasts are delicious, the staff friendly and the atmosphere comfortable. I have never sat in to eat, as I work around the corner, but every time I'm in there to pick up take out it's great. Highly recommend the eggs benedict, both the regular and royal versions are really good."}
{"text":"Just ok ! Got waffles for breakfast, which didn't taste any more special than the ones you put in a toaster. 

Prices are good; very reasonable. 

Location - dislike - I didn't like the neighborhood at all ! And the place is small on the inside. 

I would not recommend it or go there again !"}
{"text":"One of the best places for brunch in the city!! Their eggs Benedict cannot be beat!! (you get there by the way!!) Safe to say we visit here at least twice a month and will continue to do so!!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible from beginning to end.

The only saving grace is that we were greeted and seated and had water refills. Aside from that there are no redeeming qualities. 

There are flies everywhere. It's dirty. They don't get you what you order. The 'waitress' clearly doesn't care about you or her job. The hollandaise sauce is straight from a can. The food was cold. The poached eggs were badly done, just the yolks. 

I have been here many times over the past couple of years and while it was never great, it is now just awful. 

Never again"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a good diner breakfast, nothing fancy, this is what you'll get. I had a greek omlette which was terrific, my husband had the corned beef hash, he loved it. No issues at all except for the awful awful coffee. Bring your own, apparently thats ok to do here. If I owned the place, I think I would look into better coffee instead of encouraging people to bring it from elsewhere. But thats just me."}
{"text":"Had a brunch meal at Figs. I don't live too far away and thought I would finally venture out there.  The service was friendly and pretty quick. Being able to see the kitchen staff making the food was nice. The restaurant itself was clean and gave a comfy positive atmosphere.  Coffee was always flowing and the food was great. A traditional breakfast with some personal touches.  Yummy"}
{"text":"I still have to give 5 stars for the food. But your service sucks. 

Either it's like pulling teeth to get my bill, or that french guy gives us our bill too.early and refuses to fill my coffee. 


I didn't get a single coffee refill, last time I asked for pancakes be gave me french toast. Are you dead or just not care?"}
{"text":"Had egg Benny with peameal bacon, pretty decent, and they are open till 4 , which is a bonus"}
{"text":"I forgot my work key (on my second day!!!) in the washroom and they held it for me...I guess that's common courtesy but still, I was so happy to get it back that I have a bit of a biased liking towards this place. 
But, trying my best to rate the place on service and taste, rather than finding my key.....

Considering the lack of options if you're in the hood on a regular basis, FIGS is a'ight. 
It's not cheap, but for take-out it's not that expensive, either. 
It is definitely nothing to brag about but again not too many joints in the area are. 
I got a greek salad to go for lunch because it was cheap and it was decent. Considering the lack of  competition for great places to eat over there, I'll be going back for my take-out lunches."}
{"text":"Loved this place when I lived around the corner, I got the know the girls that worked there and could either call in an order to go or have it ready when I got there. Great window seats so that my pooch could come along and I could watch him out the window."}
{"text":"Greasy spoon diner in corktown, the Breakfast Grill is cheap, cheerful with a focus on you guessed it, breakfast fare. The decor is barebones casual, open and inviting with plenty of neighborhood regulars and families inhabiting the joint on weekends. Perfect for a quick weekend breakfast meal though maybe not so much for a leisurely brunch with friends.

I've been here a few times to chow down and they do their stuff well here, the omlettes are fluffy and big and my bacon and eggs are always done right. For $6.25, you get 3 eggs and not 2 but 5! pieces of soggy partially crisped bacon with some of their wondeful roti-style hashbrowns and toast on the side. Service is quick and cute although some of the staff are invariably eye candy for the male regulars!"}
{"text":"Pros:  
- Good prices, average dish is ~$10
- Solid breakfast food and good serving sizes

Cons: 
- Overly crowded during prime brunch hours.  I saw six people crammed at a table for four.  We were also asked to move tables half way through our brunch to make room for a larger party (that was sort of weird).
- Substitutions not allowed (I don't eat bacon and they wouldn't replace it with anything or add more potatoes to my plate.  

I'd come again, but will probably avoid peak hours."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place. I think info in most reviews about that non existent service or the owner is correct. Service is one point Im going to touch on. As well food and the decor/tables

The food, I had the full breakfast with fresh toast, the first thing that was odd was there was no regular toast included, if i had know that (or i should read menu better) I probably wont have gone with over easy. I later inquired about this and it doesnt because it includes french toast, pancake or waffles (cant dip those into my eggs but whatever) which mean I should have read the menu and not relied on my past experience with most breakfast meals that do. 

On to the eggs, despite no toast the eggs were cook well,  could use salt but i add that after and pepper. The yolk was nice and runny like i like with eggs, the potatoes both the fries and hash were good. The hash was probably the star. Nothing to stellar about the sausage or bacon

What was really a let down was the french toast,  not only did i have little cup of syrup.(getting more was extra) but i couldnt use it full to drown out the odd taste, i think the cinnamon over powered things and there was a fruit taste to it that i didnt like. Turns out it was orange juice add to it which was terrible and bad choice. I might eat here again (probably not) but not the french, toast, waffle or pancake since that orange juice is add, and i dont want mention not to add it.... Owner does lack customer service skill as I read, so bringing the up will just cause problems

Service seem almost none existant, seem a bit awkward, thou the place seem to have a fair bit of regulars and those were more attended too which happens but shouldn't. There are issue with owner as others have mentioned, its good i didnt deal with her too much

Probably one of main concern was the state of the tables and the restaurant. For one I noticed there is no constant note, some table had this glass on it other didn't, mind did and it really didnt help their case, it was dirty, not wiped properly which isnt nice to look at not to mention, it was chipped. That just a hazard, I moved to another table because the glass but the other table was in same shape of disrepair, it like they dont maintain their restuant and it look terrible, 

you have random broken things like the window i was by had the tiles broken too, I dont know why the owner doesnt pay attention to the condition of their restaurant . This isnt something I usually comment on but it bother me that much.

The eggs and the hash were good but there are too many issue with this place to warrent more then 2 or even a return visit. This place is overrated and doesnt deserve it's 4 star"}
{"text":"This bright, clean and cheery place is good for a quick breakfast.  They don't seem entirely set up for take-out but they were more than accommodating to us and the variations we asked for (bagel instead of bread for my breakfast sandwich but they did forget the tomato).  Much of the menu is egg-based (they've posted articles about how it's actually good to eat eggs often) but there are several meatless options."}
{"text":"We had the all day breakfast with a side of French toast. Everything was cooked perfectly and the portions were just the right size. You left feeling good and not overly full. The side of French toast was awesome! Figs is now one of my \"go too\" spots for a great breakfast!"}
{"text":"Great spot for some freshly cooked breakfast. Food is always good here and service friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"brunch gem!!  amazing food, good portions, at a great price!!  they need some help with the a/c, and we felt a little rushed by the servers. but otherwise, a great experience. would definitely recommend this place, and we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Actually?it's the second time for me to check-in.My host recommended it to me.It's great place.I love it's plant and flowers.I had full breakfast with pancakes?tasted pretty good.The female boss is very nice and friendly.I told her I went Canada for studying English so she had patience with me.Thanks so much.I will study hard.I hope I can talk with her smoothly when I check-in next time."}
{"text":"Food is average at best. Service is deplorable. We were rushed out of there. No one should be rushed out of a brunch meal. Shockingly bad, almost surly, service. Never again."}
{"text":"I would put this at a 2.5 star rating.

It seems like a popular spot on a Sunday if you're looking to brunch in Cabbagetown so be prepared to face a line if you get there during the primetime brunching hours.

The menu is large but it offers the regular fare for brunch that you would expect with no real frills.  it's just simple and honest breakfast plates, eggs benedict, omelettes, and etc.

I wasn't overly impressed but it is as advertised."}
{"text":"Small space. Would recommend making reservations of going on the weekend. Pretty decent food with appropriate pricing."}
{"text":"Very quickly, first time there, ordered a clubhouse (no side) to go and a large chocolate milk. no large chocolate milk so they gave me 2 small. $20.00 for a sandwich and milk. Definitely wont be back with those prices. too many other choices in the hood."}
{"text":"The best breakfast place in the area!!

I've been here many times and it's always been a great experience. The food is fresh, well prepared and pretty to look at on the plate, portions are huge, the atmosphere is low-key/casual, the staff are friendly and welcoming -- especially the owner, and best of all it's cheap ($4 for 3 eggs, potatoes and toast!!!). They care and it shows.

I made a mistake in trying somewhere new for breakfast yesterday and instantly regretted it. I'll be back Figs!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great customer service, really clean. Best benedicte eggs ever as well as corn beef hash potetos. When back in Toronto we will be back to eat."}
{"text":"I am updating my review due to the service being so 'bleh' during our recent visits. We come here maybe once a week ? Or maybe 2 times a month when we can get a table and theres no line up. 
We have been experiencing very disappointing service from the lady who is in charge of the cash register (whom I believe is the owner/manager of the restaurant). 

On different visits:
1. We were seated and ordered, then Manager lady asks us to move tables. Not a big deal however did not like being moved over to the corner.

2. The Manager lady gives the waitress our bill before we have even finished our meal, no line ups no need to rush us out. Did not like that hint of kicking us out.

3. Our poached eggs seem to be getting smaller and smaller to the point they're super tiny on our benny's. Not sure what is up with that but I expected a bigger egg for the price we were paying.

The service seems to be getting worse each time we visit, we come here to enjoy our day off not to be rushed out of our seats. So with that I leave you with the updates of their service and you can keep it in mind of when you visit. Food is good it's just the service really dulls the food down.

Update Nov 1, 2015:
Came here for brunch with friends, waited to be seated and the infamous \"owner lady\" told the waiter not to seat me at the table for 4 that was empty RIGHT in front of me. I told him we were a table of 3. Anyways, the waiter ended up letting me sit down at the table seeing as the restaurant wasn't full and I was just standing there with empty tables in front of me. So literally 5 mins of sitting down and getting my menus my friends come in right after a line up starts forming outside. After placing our order in with the waitress, the owner lady comes to us and asks us if we could be reseated. I told her politely that we just sat down and we did not want to be reseated and that this was not the first time that we have been asked to be reseated at this restaurant. We had JUST sat down, and ordered. We got there early and got our table, I understand that they wanted to give the bigger table to the larger party but why at our expense? Why did we have to be asked ...again to be reseated? That's not fair. We've had times where we've had to wait outside in the cold for a table and no exceptions were made for us. After telling her No respectfully, she sends the male waiter to ask me again. I respectfully declined again. They can't constantly be asking customers to be reseating us at the back every time they have a large group. The first time they asked us, we did reseat after we had ordered coffee and drinks they shoved us into the corner. This time they asked us I just simply declined, we're paying customers, we're tired and we got there early to get a table. The owner lady is rude, and I am simply sick of this place's customer service. When we first came here we fell in love to have finally found a great breakfast/brunch place to call our own. But now it's all gone down the drain, we get shoved aside and even the food has declined. The eggs are barely there (take a look at the picture of my recent eggs benny served with only the yolk and no egg white) it's sad and disappointing that this is how they service paying customers. Will not be coming back here again, gave them one last chance and they've tarnished everything I loved about them. It's my day off too, and I don't need pay a place to be mistreated for food I can always get somewhere else."}
{"text":"I had the light breakfast abs my husband had the potatoes pancakes and three eggs and bacon.  It was delicious."}
{"text":"We came across this quaint breakfast/brunch place after visiting a nearby church. The 4 star reviews in Yelp intrigued me. Figs is not a big chain breakfast place, but they definitely are doing something right when it comes to breakfast and brunch because this place was packed. The place was clean with multiple wooden tables and chairs squeezed into the smallish restaurant. The wait staff were friendly and attentive despite how busy it was. Our food came out less than 10 minutes after we ordered. 
I ordered the classic eggs Benedict with peameal bacon. These were honestly the best eggs Benedict that I have ever tasted as they were balanced and not sour like some places. The portion size was huge, and came with 3 eggs and generous pieces of perfectly cooked peameal bacon served with a not too heavy hollandaise sauce atop lightly toasted English muffins. My dish also came with delicious crispy fried potatoes and a shredded potato pancake. 
My hubby ordered the full breakfast, which was served with two eggs, two strips of perfectly crispy bacon, and two sausages, served with the same delicious potatoes and potato pancake as my meal. The full breakfast included a choice of pancakes, French toast or waffle for $12. Crunchy caramelized edges and slight orange essence take Figs' French toast to a sublime level. Figs makes deliciously light French toast that was served with a light sprinkle of powdered sugar and maple syrup on the side, not weighed down with tons of heavy toppings like at other establishments so the French toast has a chance to shine.
For these two huge meals and two mini-pots of tea, the total came to $32 plus tip. For the quality of food, portion sizes that fill you for the rest of the day, and great service, this was well worth the price. We will bring family with us next time so they can experience this gem of a brunch place.

(10/100)"}
{"text":"This place is pretty darn good. Let's start on the service tip: I actually like that on weekends they usually have at least 3-4 waitresses working for such a small place, so even though you are still at the mercy of the kitchen for your food to arrive, they are on point with getting you seated, ordered, and paid after your meal... Ultimately I can appreciate that they are pretty good at flipping tables so even when the place is full you probably shouldn't have to wait long for a table. 

Food wise: $8 for the standard egg/meat/potato/toast breakfast but you get 4 sausages instead of the usual 3, and they give you 2 types of potatoes (some home fries and some shredded hash type vibes). Works out to $21.50 after tax before tip for 2 standard breakfasts and 1 coffee. 

A fair offer for a good meal. Go get it."}
{"text":"Had the big salmon breakfast, it was quite good, but to be honest I wanted more salmon. My wife had the latkes, which were well seasoned and cooked."}
{"text":"Another fantastic late brunch experience at Figs! Our bill for two only came to $28 pre-tip. No wait at the door on a Sunday at 1:30PM, amazing.

The Greek yogurt is great - it is unflavored and very authentically creamy and thick rather than runny, which sometimes is the case if too much sugar or other ingredients are added. The portion size was pretty large - we shared it between the 2 of us. The fruit add-on was a bit underwhelming - just a tiny cup of mostly melon fruits, but also one grape, a few pineapple slices, a grapefruit slice, and half a strawberry. 

The veggie omelette was thick, large, and very healthy - no cheese and lots of veggies! However it was really bland, but no big deal since you can always season it yourself with condiments and mustard, ketchup, etc. It comes with fried potato chunks, a potato hash, and 2 slices of toast (ask for whole wheat!). Note- the bread is buttered by default, so request for plain if you don't want butter. The grilled vegetarian sandwich was very large and pretty, but was very runny. It does not contain egg or cheese I believe, but comes on a baguette, so not vegan?
 Partner described it to taste like stir-fry.

Will be back!"}
{"text":"The food was quite tasty. That said, the wait was ghastly.  My reviews tend to be  now done in the following format.
W=worth
A-Ambiance
R-Returnability.
W: the food was slightly overpriced comparative to their competitors. The fare, while average, wasn't nessicarily generous in helping. Also the $2.00 coffee with only one refill was a bit of a joke. (Mug size was akin to my 90 year old grandmother)

A: I didn't check out their washroom. Sorry, I can't speak to that. The joint is pleasantly coloured, although very noisy. The cleanliness is passable.  The staff where very pleasant and the overall experience was of a family business. Quaint.

R:  sadly this place doesn't have the chops to keep up with their competitors... 50/50 if a return is in order."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Sunday! We ordered the California Eggs Benedict and the Hash. Here you get 3 eggs instead of the usual 2 for eggs benedict. It was good except the avocado wasn't ripe yet so it was kind of hard to eat! It came with fruit though so that's always a plus! :) The hash was also really good! Overall a good solid brunch spot :)."}
{"text":"Great food, but a little crammed inside. Went on Sunday for brunch, and hardly anyone could move in the place. Otherwise, recommended."}
{"text":"I have started eating here for breakfast. It is fast, efficient and the food is good. It is filled with many regulars as it's obvious that the waitresses know many of the patrons. That's not a criticism, but a compliment to their food and customer service.  In sum, I am looking forward to breakfast tomorrow at Figs!"}
{"text":"I would give 0 stars if I could. Found a hair in my food. They were completely rude and disputed it. I will never be coming back again. Disgusting - on both fronts."}
{"text":"I get it. I work in the industry and it sucks when you have to seat one person at a four-top. But that's the way things go sometimes. Don't make that person feel awkward or embarrassed because of this and don't change the quality of service they receive. Also: food is fairly inconsistent and pretty meh. But until we get more brunch places in the neighbourhood, I guess I'll keep coming back, mostly because I'm a lazy man."}
{"text":"Love this place. Delicious breakfast, fresh ingredients, good price, big portions, happy service. Always have a great time. Highly recommended. Eggs Benedict are especially good - the hollandaise is perfect, and you get 3 Benny's instead of the usual 2."}
{"text":"I came here cause I was in the neighbourhood and I thought the food would be ok but I was totally disappointed, from the poor level of service to the food which was pretty bad as well. I mean come on, how can you mess up coffee. In short don't go there. And don't be fooled by the pictures on Yelp."}
{"text":"We love this place, the potato pancakes, the eggs benny, the steak and eggs. All yummy. It is true the woman at the cash is a bit of a grump but the rest of the staff are fantastic!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Very good value. I came here for the first time on Saturday and was really impressed. Their hash browns are delicious. This is my new go to place on the east-side for brunch."}
{"text":"One thing I struggle with while in Toronto is getting an early breakfast on Sunday's, and that very dilemma lead me to Figs Breakfast & Lunch for the very first time this morning. We made the 15 minute walk here this morning in hopes of finding a new favourite breakfast spot. We came here around 9am and the place was pretty empty so we were seated right away. Our waitress was friendly and was quick to take our orders and get us some water. I ended up ordering some chocolate chip pancakes (which I'll pretty much order every single time it's an option). The food only took 10 or so minutes to come out and maybe another 10 to of magically disappear from my plate. The pancakes were pretty average chocolate chip pancakes, they were not fantastic, but they were also not bad, they were just good basic pancakes. I have nothing bad to say about Figs, but for me it was just a basic breakfast experience that has left no lasting impression on me, but if you are in the area, it's worth trying."}
{"text":"Tasted great. Portions and prices are pretty good too. My classic eggs benny was $12 and there were three of them - normally there's two. Overall I'd come back. Service was friendly and prompt too."}
{"text":"Had a very serviceable lunch-for-breakfast fare with great beans and a very hearty side salad. No complaints; definitely a great choice if you want breakfast or breakfast-for-lunch in the area.

Just remember to ask for service; it won't come of its own."}
{"text":"Recommended by a friend told it could be very slow. Walked over and  sat right away and offered a drink immediately, great start. I ordered the Benny and spouse the pancakes. Both came quickly and very good. Staff friendly and the place small but comfortable.  I 'm fussy about B-Fast and especially my Benny and I was not disappointed, will come back again no problem. Prices are very good and you won't leave hungry."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb diggity for brunch. Not a great neighborhood but figs has a really good menu with a lot of variety and reasonable prices.  Only been once but the service was great.  The background music was good too and not too loud. I definitely recommend it if you want to try a new brunch place."}
{"text":"Food is usually outstanding. I eat here at least once a week. Anything with eggs is terrific.
Service varies. They have outstanding waiters, and a couple of less-than-stellar waitresses. If the waitresses are working the lunch crowd, I know I'm getting up to get my own coffee unless I'm willing to wait for a while. I don't mind.
The owner is wonderful. She sometimes gives me extra grapes (they have unusual grapes there). 

Coffee is always good here, prices are very fair for a solid/large breakfast.
It's a good place for kid food, but please leave them home? Some of us like peaceful meals."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff and very cool ambience. I had the meat lovers breakfast and it was quite filing."}
{"text":"This place is becoming a staple for me. I love the breakfast. It hits the spot every time. The pancakes are fluffy and delicious. The service is fast and friendly. No complaints here."}
{"text":"Eggs benedict is on point. Was surprised to get 3 on my plate. 
Only time 3 isn't a crowd. 

If I lived in the area, this would be my once a month brunch spot. A place I would bring outta-towners for the quick breakfast/lunch/brunch fix."}
{"text":"Service was good but food was bad. Worse than eggsmart. Ordered the potato pancakes. I suppose if you like a lot of salt this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Astonishingly poor food-the reviews here genuinely shocked me. How can you messing items as simple as eggs over medium, potato bites and eggs benny? The food was GROSS, and my stomach concurred for the next hour after I left. Even the salad tasted like potpourri. Astonishing lack of adequate ambience; it looks somewhat decrepit and dirty. Look for something else."}
{"text":"Delicious & Nutritious! The service was swift and sweet. Perfect for brunch. Portion sizes are more than sufficient. The eggs bene were PERFECT. We had a few stragglers who didn't make it with us, but they were kind enough to take a few to go orders."}
{"text":"I had their Belgian waffle and it was well-executed. My friend had their standard egg and bacon breakfast and it was generous. I'm a big fan of the fig fruit, so it would've been nice to have some menu options containing figs; fruit cup with fresh figs, fig cake, fig muffins, fig waffles! As with comments from other reviewers, the coffee isn't good even though the restaurant was busy, so it should be fresh tasting at least. There really is no excuse for shoddy coffee in Toronto -- there are many restaurant supply stores with affordable machines that will brew coffee correctly and lots of nice tasting coffees available."}
{"text":"I am very happy with my meat lovers breakfast today. The hash and potatoes are done so well and crispy. Lots of food too. I start to like this place more, they are not trying to be hip, but really focusing on making their regular items on the menu taste consistent and good. And at queen and Parliament the place is always full but both times I was here I did not have to line up. I will definitely come back again on the days I don't want to travel far."}
{"text":"After a night of too much drinking and waking up extremely hungover, my non-cooking fiancé went to The Fig (we live literally 2 minutes away) and brought me home the best breakfast (and hangover cure ever) From the first bite to the last I was not disappointed. The bacon, over easy eggs, toast, homefries and hash were all equally as delicious.. But as a bacon lover this bacon takes the cake.. It has a mapley taste that just keeps you wanting more.. I highly recommend The Fig and cannot wait to try the royal eggs benedict. Keep up the amazing cooking!"}
{"text":"I ended up here because its one of the few breakfast spots that open early on Sunday's. The place is small and location on a side street off of Queen east. I got potato pancakes and they were real so so. They had an odd sweet flavor to them that didn't really go. Overall the food was alright, and I'm delighted by their hours."}
{"text":"Really great food and wonderful service! You won't leave disappointed. I had the pancakes and they were probably the best I've ever had. Eggs are fresh and perfectly cooked too."}
{"text":"I went to Figs on a Saturday morning, the place was packed and luckily we were sat within 5 minutes. The menu is pretty standard for a breakfast diner. The service was fairly quick considering the place was full. We were very impressed with the portion sizes considering the average price for one of their dishes is $11. I really look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Loved the breakfast we ordered. I had 3 eggs, bacon , toast and potatoes and all tasted well. Our server was polite and prompt. $20 breakfast for 3. 

Be aware of name change to Figs and only open for breakfast and lunch. Many locals eat here and would have graded higher except for the size."}
{"text":"I'm giving it a 3 star because the California eggs Benedict is the best tasting that I ever had. But 17$ before tip, that is very pricey. So poor people can't afford this place. Also no wifi."}
{"text":"Food is good.  Value for money is pretty good (except for the $6 glass of juice).  My main complaint is that they rush you out of the restaurant.  I had barely finished my meal, and had a full cup of coffee, when they gave me the bill and told me to pay and leave.  I had been there for LESS than 40 minutes, so not dawdling.  I complained to the owner, who apologized and offered to give me a $10 credit on my NEXT meal, but it was too little, too late."}
{"text":"I go to Figs all the time.  The food is great.  The owner is fanatical about the quality of her food.  I think I've tried everything at least once.  This is a great place to eat breakfast.  I bring my family on the weekend and clients during the week.  One of the hidden gems in the city."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in the area by far.

I go at least once a month and the breakfast items are great (particularly the omelettes). I find that the service is consistently good, even during busy periods. Another bonus for a diner is that the coffee is actually quite good.

I live near Le Petit Dejuner, Fran's, and a huge swath of popular and highly rated breakfast/brunch places around Front East, and find that I keep coming back to Figs despite the walk.

The past reviews are full of one time bad experiences, don't let those sway you from trying out this great little place."}
{"text":"My pal says this should be a 1 star, for he was \"ENRAGED\".

I'm going to give it 2 stars, and blame his hangover *slightly* for his hatred of F I G S. 

The food was fine, diner food, the usual, but it cost us almost $40. For breakfast?! That ain't right! 

Our server was new, and she was sweet but her boss kept giving her the stink eye and correcting her which just made all of us patrons uncomfortable.

Finally, the boss brought us our change from our overpriced bill and shorted us $10... and then sort of blamed us for her error. ENRAGING my pal. 

PS: Why is Figs spelled like an acronym F I G S? WHY?!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  As others have mentioned, the service is variable, but the food is outstanding offered at very reasonable prices.  So much so that I'm a regular here.  (At least once a week!  

Honestly, if you don't mind hunting down your server from time to time then it's well worth checking out.  

FWIW - I agree with the others here too - the Eggs Benedict are AWESOME....and they are flexible with their ingredients so if you want to snazz it up a bit you surely can - just ask!   

Love the owner for that reason - she's always asking questions and trying to find ways of making the food experience more enjoyable."}
{"text":"The Fig is an excellent choice for breakfast!  It is a busy place but the service and food are great.  I was very happy my Full Breakfast with French toast.  My wife had an omelette and quite enjoyed it.  They do not scrimp on ingredients such as pea meal bacon.  We are adding this to one our favourite brekky places."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I eat out a lot when I'm in town visiting and this place did not disappoint. Great portions and really delicious.  He got the Eggs benedict (traditional) and said they were great and I got the Pancakes with fruit, yogurt and granola with a side of hash browns (which were amazing)!  We'll definitely be back."}
