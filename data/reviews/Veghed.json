{"text":"The Muay Thai Box is one of the best salads I've ever eaten. It's packed full of fresh ingredients. I wouldn't even know where to start to create this at home. Whenever I eat at Veghed, I feel like I'm doing something great for my body."}
{"text":"Great little place. Went for a snack. My friend got a ginger tea and she said it was really good! I myself got a beet brownie. Doesn't sound very good but it was delicious! Also owners were super nice and helpful. Totally recommend!"}
{"text":"I've walked by many times. I really disliked the ice cream shop that was here before, so I guess I was biases against the location. Well, all this raving about the Muay Thai salad box is completely justified. It is $8 and huge. It is delicious. And the people serving are a complete delight. I'm not vegetarian but would definitely go back. Highly recommend for quick lunch in the area."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favour and go here. 

I've had a couple of their salads and one of their smoothies. All super fresh and filing. And affordable considering the quality!

You can wait a while for the food, but it's worth it. Definitely going back when in Toronto next."}
{"text":"My favourite place for the most luxurious salad without the high end price tag! I almost always get the Muay Thai box, but their grill cheese is gourmet and amazing too!

Their beet brownies are succulent and are a real treat. 

When I want to feel extra healthy I also get their tumeric ginger, apple juice."}
{"text":"Sooooo - this place is epic. They understand simplicity, nutrition, value, and spectacular flavour. Your tastebuds may never be able to do \"bland\" again. The chef is right behind the counter, whistling and humming songs, while he lovingly chops, sprinkles, stirs, concocts multi-layer treasure hunt, mounts of goodness. 

The menu is pure: Three unchanging dishes and one that changes daily. Some smoothies, some juices, and the most delicious, pillowy vegan brownies. That's it. Believe me, you don't need more.

I've had their muay-thai salad multiple times, which schools me in fusion and comfort at once. Also had the daily feature, which is always fascinating. I never miss the brownies because, well, why the heck would i?

This place raises my self-esteem."}
{"text":"I loves the meat. I needs the meat. But sometimes you gotta get some of them leafy greens up in ya. Veghed has gotchu!

The muay thai dish is the nexus between art and salad. A kaleidoscope of raw veggie goodness on a bed of tasty glass noodles.

The rotating hot dishes (ancho coconut kale chili / wild mushroom soup / yellow curry) always delivers on its promise. 

The lovely couple that runs this joint is the MOST adorbs. Just the sweetest.

Bottom line, do yourself a favour. Get up in there, boi!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  Vegeterian or not, the Muay Thai Box is the most delicious salad combo I've ever had.  Perfectly combined ingredients, wholly satisfying, out of this world flavor.  And for $8, it's a steal!"}
{"text":"This salad was truly inspired. VEGHED is a tiny fresh Thai place that basically only has two things on the menu... Because they only need two!  Layers unseen include turmeric bean noodle and fresh bean sprouts... My tummy is so happy. 

I rarely give 5 stars, so please understand that this is 5 stars in category of small fresh food vendor, not five course seated restaurant :)"}
{"text":"The Thai salad is huge and contains about 20 fresh ingredients.   It's really delicious and cheap   I love this place. I wish they would be open on Sunday's"}
{"text":"Incredible food for a casual little spot where the menu changes daily based on real healthy ingredients.  Seriously complex and delicious warm and hearty offerings.  This is far from your average salad/bowl shop."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, I can't recommend it enough. I ordered a massive salad (aka \"the 20 piece\") and literally could not stop stuffing it in my face. The salad was so flavourful, with a crazy amount of veggies, seeds, dressing and cubes of tofu. After eating it, I felt like a few years had been added on to my life - it's just that healthy. The service is also incredibly friendly and all the other customers seemed cheery too."}
{"text":"This place is simply amazing! Such great, healthy and well priced food. I come here all the time! Muay Thai box is out of this world. I wish it was open on weekends. Go there now!"}
{"text":"Grilled cheese was crap!! This restaurant is not trust worthy. Just went there today for a quick dinner. Ordered grilled cheese takeout. It was burnt. I stood there saw them cooking it and realizing it was completely burnt. So I assumed they were gonna make me a new one, well they didn't. Who would give a burnt toast knowingly? Ughhh so disappointed"}
{"text":"The service here is impeccable and the food is beyond delicious. It's quite dangerous that I work so close - good bye wallet. Please try it if you are in the area - get the Muay Thai box!"}
{"text":"This place is incredible. Every dish, from the salads and soups to the amazing grilled cheese, is rich with flavours. Great value, great fresh and subtle flavours, and great friendly welcoming service. Well worth going out of your way to pick up a delicious lunch or eat at the counter and watch the neighbourhood. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"As everyone else has already said, the MUAY THAI bowl is MUAY DELICIOUS. I ate this thing 2 days in a row. I have never been so happy and satisfied from a salad before. I still can not stop thinking about it. There are so many different and satisfying flavours; the crunch peanuts and sprouts, the fresh herbs, the tangy dressing, the chewy noodles. Everything about it is perfect. What an amazing value. This place is tiny but making mighty good food. love love love."}
{"text":"Had the muay thai salad...it was awesome! Alot of great flavours and good value. Would highly recommend this place to anyone, veggie or non."}
{"text":"Never had vegan food, but this place had me considering a conversion! The place is very small with a window counter and a two person bench in the restaurant and out. The owner's wife greeted us and she was very nice and accommodating to is newcomers. She recommended the Muy Thai bowls (MTB) for newcomers and I did not regret it. It was a generous portion and I was full by the end of the meal without feeling overindulgent or immovable. I will be coming back. The prices and decent and the food is quick."}
{"text":"Very good. Complex flavours. Not too pricey for the amount that you get. The most redeeming qualities about this place are: the conviviality of the owner/employees, the consistency in quality of the dish as you devour (doesn't get dry or bland), and how healthy and guilt-free you feel after the meal. My only issue with this place is that I may or may not have gotten mild food poisoning. It may have just been something else I ate, considering the friends I went with were fine. Overall, a cute spot."}
{"text":"Had the Muay Thai salad and it was excellent! I don't write reviews often but was very pleased with the service and excellent quality of the food. I find a lot of 'healthy' fast-service restaurants try and use a lot of grains as fillers and skimp on the vegetables which is not the case here. I'm not vegetarian either, but I will be making this a new regular spot."}
{"text":"Small place but very kind staff and delicious meal! Amazing color and taste. We were all very satisfied. Very good price too."}
{"text":"The staff here are so friendly and happy it's impossible to leave in a bad mood. Huge portions of a variety of vegetables for a cheap price. Everything on the menu is delicious! By far the best vegetarian joint in the city."}
{"text":"Wow - best vegan bowl ever! Their Muay Thai bowl has so much flavour and a wonderful crunch. I wasn't sure what to expect when I was served the heaping portion - so full of of lovely veggies, yam noodles, fresh herbs, sprouts and nuts. 

If I lived closer to this gem I would eat there multiple times a week!"}
{"text":"This place is it. Their Muay Thai salad box is packed to overflow with so many ingredients (apparently 20, but it looks like more) that every bite is a new li'l adventure. Crazy delicious and clean. If you're feeling like your body hates you for what you consumed on the weekend, grab this for lunch and you'll be sorted out. The lady behind the counter is always so happy and sweet, so they must be making money, but at $7 it's hands down the best value in the area. Marry me, salad lady?"}
{"text":"I never really write a review but the lady who works here was so nice and happy that I am happy to help her by writing a review. The food here was amazing and unique, it is different then any other healthy restaurant I have been to. The sauce was amazing! I will definately go back :)"}
{"text":"I don't have much to add to the many rave reviews and detailed descriptions of the Muy Thai Bowl (MTB) but damn that's a good salad. And magically it evolves as you eat it. Starting with delicate little sprigs off the top and then you hit those first taste of dressing and after that you find the duck egg (if you ordered one) and another kind of dressing and when it is starting to get kind of messy and churned up you discover a trove of noodles and another whole different array of tastes. It's a real experience eating it. Made with love by some really nice people this is something special."}
{"text":"Pros: Muy Thai box was pretty much the only thing on the menu. It was flavorful and ample in size. I skipped on the grilled cheese.

Cons: A bit expensive for a salad."}
{"text":"Hands down the best vegetarian in Toronto. The salads, soups, and noodle bowls are bursting with flavour totally unique to this type of hippie/yuppie cuisine. And the price is so reasonable, you are left feeling like you should actually be paying more."}
{"text":"Honestly I feel sorry for those of you who don't know about this place! Hands down, the best value in the city. The food is so nutritious, and yummy. You really can't ask for more!! Love this place!!"}
{"text":"As other reviewers have pointed out, the Muay Thai Box ($8) is excellent. However, I wouldn't say it was \"incredible\". It had a great diversity of flavors packed in that went together well. For example, the little bit of mint and basil added a nice touch. It was filling and satisfying. The price is fair."}
{"text":"Great service,delicious menu. This is coming from a meat lover too... It's not a huge space so great for a quick takeout lunch but not amazing if you're looking to sit down and stay a while. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I came here while waiting for some friends.  I tried their Muay Thai box.  All I can say was this was a massive salad with like 12+ vegetables with yam noodles at the bottom (I think that's what they were).  It was absolutely delicious. I believe everything is organic as well.

The server/cashier was also very friendly.  It's a small place (more like a takeout/juice bar), but it has a good hipster feel to it and is very healthy, tasty and satisfying. If you like interesting salads, definitely a good place to go."}
{"text":"The soups here are mindblowing thanks to chef Ren Mercer. So many layers, notes and flavours. 

Other specialties including fresh veggies juices and tonics and fermented foods like truffle pickle beets. 

Recommend everything here and Ruth is fun to talk to too."}
{"text":"Such a special place.  Every meal I've gotten has been colourful, healthy and exciting to eat.  The staff is sweet and so helpful.  The price is great as well.  I'll definitely be returning here."}
{"text":"I had the most delicious salad I've ever had in my life today and it was the Muay Thai salad noodle box.  Beautiful presentation. The duck egg is a must!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite salad. Bumped into it during my short stay around the area and tried the Muay Thai salad bowl based on yelp reviews and in love with it.  The place was bustling with regulars it seemed and the owner of the place was really warm and nice. It's a small place with 2-3 seats inside and outside so a lot of people did take outs for it."}
{"text":"Huge fan of everything they do at this lovely little place! In the winter I would get the healing hot lemon and ginger juice that I'd argue saved me from getting sick this past winter. Most recently I got a box (soup, salad and rice) and it was so intensely flavourful and beautiful, I never wanted it to end. A vegan curry stew that was so fresh and light and a salad with teeny greens, flower petals and garlic chips, I love it so much here, if only it was open til 8 or 9!"}
{"text":"Omg the muay thai is really best box in the city! So flavourful and complex with the sweet potato glass noodles and all the veggies and authentic thai flavours (not sweet thai sauce). Also it's so massive they can't close it. I actually just drove across the city to get it because I had a craving. The lady who runs the place also might be one of the friendliest people I have ever met. I reallyyyy wish it was open on the weekends so I could pick it up and go to the park. Definitely check it out!!"}
{"text":"Finally made a stop here after wanting to come for over a year since moving to Toronto! The reviews are not lying, this place is SO friggen GOOD! And the lady behind the counter is just the sweetest! Highly recommended for anyone (+meat-eaters!) To try deliciously made vegetarian/vegan options!

I had the Muay Thai Salad. A bunch of organic spinach, daicon, radish +other organic ingredients on a bed of glass noodles in sesame peanut sauce. Highly recommended for peanut sauce lovers (of which I conveniently am :D)!! Very glad I chose their food for my first visit but everything here looks delish!!"}
{"text":"Review #100!!!! So excited to review Veghed, as it's just a phenomenal find. If you peruse my reviews, you'll discover a few things about me. My food groups are often sugar, doughnuts, and BBQ. I also like coffee and liquor. Now yes, everything in moderation and all that - but point is, I am far from a crunchy granola hippie head. I don't need my food to be detoxifying or whatever, I need my food to taste good, I need to enjoy the experience of what I eat. And that is where Veghed comes in. This is the healthiest, most immaculately prepared, incredibly DELICIOUS vegetarian food that you will ever LOVE. LOVE, ALL CAPS LOVE. I have gone back to this place 3 times this week. The food here makes me feel like a super hero, like I can fly and move mountains and sh*t. But it also is some of the best food I've ever tasted. Faves are the Muay Thai Noodle Salad, an ammmaaaaaazzziiing deal at $7. You could totally make two meals of it, and it's fresh and delicious and full of yam noodles and veg goodness. The grilled cheese is some of the best I've ever eaten, complete with apple slices and honey on top. You can order it with the salad, for which I will quote Amy Pataki of the Toronto Star: 
\"With the salad, a lavish affair starring 20 ingredients, Veghed gets interesting. Spiralized beets and zucchini meet cross-sectioned radishes and shaved heirloom carrots. Kale, spinach, broccoli florets, cucumber and a lime wedge bring the green. Crisp shallots supply crunch, as do the seeds: organic hemp, sunflower and pumpkin. Vegan lemon-pomegranate vinaigrette pulls it nicely together.\" And I swear to you, on my first visit to Veghed, I actually watched the chef pluck one substandard piece of purple basil off the top of my salad, and replace it with another, more perfect piece of basil. They are meticulous about every detail here. Not only does this salad taste good, it's a feast for the senses - soooo many gorgeous colors and flavours and textures all coming together. It's harmonious, unique, and you won;t be able to stop eating it. I took a vegetarian friend for lunch and she commented how all of this leads to a stronger sense of satisfaction - veggie food can be boring, both in taste and in experience - food as fuel, not fun. This food is an experience will make you giddy, that you will want to enjoy over and over again, that will make you feel like a god. Oh, and they have this lemon-ginger-turmeric tea? They sell it in big mason jars for $10. It's like liquid gold. You can drink it hot, cold. I've been downing buckets of the stuff night and day, so addictive. Go get some now!"}
{"text":"Some of the best food in the area PERIOD. So much flavour. Tons of fresh ingredients. It's a fulfilling meal that gives you energy and leaves you  feeling good."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place to eat in Toronto. I get so excited to come here every time I visit. Ruth is a magician with flavor. Everything is whole, organic, healthy and delicious. I've eaten everything on the menu 10 times over and I'm never sick of it. I can't say enough good things about this place. It's a gem."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegetarian but Veghed is converting me. In one lunch I was served the best salad and the best grilled cheese I've ever had. Just come here and support the future of veggie dining!"}
{"text":"On the recommendation of both yelp and the staff at veghed, I got the vegan Muay Thai salad ($8). I'm so glad I took that recommendation, because it was probably the best meal I had while in Toronto! (If you want a duck egg on top the price is bumped up to just $10.)

The salad was wonderful. Some of the included veggies: spiralized beets, watercress, carrots, edamame, spinach, basil, pea shoots, cilantro, and mint. Everything was sliced really thin so no one vegetable ever overwhelmed the bowl. It was served with a really nice and very light somewhat peanuty dressing. I got the vegan version, and because I was so hungry I was expecting to need a juice to fill me up afterwards, but I wasn't even able to finish the whole thing in one sitting (I did -enthusiastically- finish it two hours later while reading at a nearby cafe though!)

I couldn't recommend Veghed more highly, so I hope that if you haven't been you'll give it a try!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. My friend recommended me to this place it wAaaaaaay surpasses any salad place in the area.

Small menu- but does it right. Amazing and friendly service.  I'm obsessed. 

Sad it's closed on the weekends but I just make sure to go there on the way home from work to get my fix."}
{"text":"I. Can't. Stop. Eating! Aaaarrrggghhh!! Little did I expect to finish that humongous Muay Thai Bowl, but I did. And I've got no regrets, yo. Honestly, I think it was one of the tastiest salads I've eaten. Good amount of protein too. Will gorge again when I visit Toronto next time for sure."}
{"text":"Literally one of my favorite things in life now is eating the Mui Thai Salad. Each layer is a packed with a new flavour layer and I haven't even tried the grill cheese I Hear neighbors talking about, and I am by parklawn! Can't wait for my next experience!!"}
{"text":"Possibly my favourite salad in the city? Oh yes it could be!

Veghed is a small and mostly take out vegan (with options to add duck egg) counter spot but wow... the flavours coming out of here are BIG.  This little spot is on Dundas with a large window front where it has enough bar seating for about 6 people.  The menu here is a simple 4 options ... their bowl of the day, the famed Muy Thai Bowl (MTB), their 20 ingredient salad, and the grilled cheese.   You do have the option of adding a duck egg to the MTB and salad and a bit more grains to the salad.  The great thing... you get a a ridiculously wonderful and flavourful HUGE salad for only $8 ($10 with egg).    Most people here order the MTB as the lovely people behind the counter was saying 90% of the people order the MTB... and I can tell you that there is a VERY good reason for it.

The MTB is a huge overflowing box of the most flavourful vibrant and crunchy salad you probably had in Toronto.  If you have had better... you gotta tell me cause it will be hard to believe!  There's over 12 ingredients in this and each one offer a new twist on the flavours you're tasting and crunching through. The peanuts, thai dressing, and chili just makes this so unique and bursting with flavour.  On top of that, it looked to have a few Thai basil and other fresh herbs (cilantro?).  At the bottom of the bowl/box are gluten free yam noodles.  I normally eat huge salads but this took a long time to even make a dent.  After munching for nearly 20 minutes straight, I kinda saw a small corner of the bottom... and I noticed all the great sauces just coated the noodles.  Normally they're quite tasteless but these guys just soaked up all the great flavours.

Even if you're not vegan, this would be a hearty, healthy, and satisfying lunch.  I'd have to jump on the bandwagon of 5 stars and give it a perfect 5 as well!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty much a meat eater and don't really eat veggies 
I decided to try a healthier diet and found this place through Yelp! 

The lady who worked behind the counter was super friendly and she recommended the Muay Thai box salad; which essentially has 12 diff veggies, dressing , yam noodles , spice and herbs. There is a vegan options with just the salad or add a duck egg.She told me that the other stuff on the menu (except for salads) was unavailable. It could be because I came here around 6:20pm and they close around 7pm.

As I ordered, several customers came as well as a Uber eats delivery guy. 

I got my order promptly, they serve your food in takeout boxes so you can decide whether you want to eat in or takeout. 
There's about 6 seats near the window if you choose to eat in, and you can pay afterwards. 

My order was about 13$ after taxes which is kind of steep for salad. But I'd  say the portions are well worth the value. I was pretty much 110% full and bloated after eating this. 

As for the flavors, the duck egg was pretty dark and runny. The runny yolk combined with the salad is divine. 
The dressing for the duck egg is a mixture of sour and spicy. 
I looked at the menu again and it did say pad Thai flavor, I'm not too sure if it taste like the pad Thai that I usually eat 
Overall, the mixture of herbs such as cilantro and the crunchiness of the beansprouts made the salad pretty refreshing. I really liked the yam noodles that they placed at the bottom as well.
The mixture of colors from the carrots, the greens as well as beets and watermelon radish made this dish very aesthetic. 

I'd definitely come here again and order  other items from the menu! 

Only thing I'd have to complain about is the duck egg was burnt and the  sourness and spice of the dressing. was a little over powering and made me thirsty, if it was toned down a little it would've been perfect!"}
{"text":"All has been said already but I agree with most reviews about the Muay Thai Box a.k.a the MTB. It's DE.LI.CIOUS!!
I went for the vegan version and loved every bit of it. It's fresh, tasty and has a lot of crunch. Yum!
The service was very good too and I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to visit Veghed since reading about it on BlogTO a year ago. According to the article, Veghed is owned by a chef who's had more than 20 years of experience working in three-Michelin-starred restaurants in Europe with top chefs such as Marco Pierre White.

This chemical-free store specializes in non-GMO/organic plant-based vegan/vegetarian take-out. Veghed has the scent of a vegetable garden. Pots and pots of pea shoot fills the restaurant with fresh vibrancy. Food is alive at Veghed. 

The Muay Thai salad box ($9) is out of the world. Veghed's 22 ingredients salad one of the best I have ever had. The owner called it the reversed daily vitamin. The salad is designed as an complete meal with yam noodle, mint, basil, pea shoot, chili, peanuts, spinach, tofu, bean sprout, cucumber, spiral beets, spiral zucchini, kale, broccoli, cauliflower, carrot, napa cabbage, cabbage, cilantro and ginger-tamarind and green leaf dressing. Just reminiscing the salad makes me salivate! 

The beet brownie ($3 for two) is equally delicious. It is a less evil counterpart to a traditional brownie with vegetable in disguise. It's the James Bond of dessert brownie.

If I have to eat at one salad for the rest of eternity, the Muay Thai Salad at Veghed is it."}
{"text":"It takes a special salad to leave a lasting memory such that I fantasize about it for days post-nosh. Usually this is an honour reserved for things covered in cheese. But the Muay Thai salad box at Veghed is one whose flavours I've been craving since I first consumed it last week. Packed with over 12 veggies, cold noodles, and tossed in a light but flavourful dressing, its both satisfying and delicious. There is so much going on that every bite is a little different and you never get bored. Also, its huge so I couldn't finish it in one sitting, but it was just as good (and not wilted at all!) when I dug into a few hours later. 

Top it off with a healthful turmeric, ginger, apple juice and you will basically feel invincible."}
{"text":"Every ounce of hype this place gets is absolutely warranted.
The famed Muay Thai Bowl is nothing short of perfect: a twenty-ingredient salad that leaves room for leftovers (dare I say, enough for two meals). The contents are delicious and perfectly balanced. Seriously, I'm generally not one to pay for salads (and have cooked at pretty salad-heavy restaurants) and this place knocked my socks off. Oh and it was $10 (with a fried duck egg on top).

The juice I ordered was also wonderful and incredibly cheap. For a fresh pressed ginger zinger it was $7 and I had almost too much of it.

On top of everything the staff was incredibly sweet. This kind of establishment (or at least comparable places I know) tends to favour the apathetic-white-girl-with-dreads kinda staff while these guys are absolutely the opposite. Veghed is unabashedly friendly, unpretentious and delicious. Totally the kind of place you could image yourself being a regular."}
