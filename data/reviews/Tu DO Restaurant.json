{"text":"Being the pho addict that I am,I had to try the new Ritz (formerly TuDo).It seems the ownership is new,but the cook (an older Vietmanese lady) is the same.I had visited TuDo several times,finding it decent but not among my favorites.The place has been spruced up with new furniture,
wall coverings and floor tile.All this is nice but it's all about the pho for me.I ordered my usual  goi cuon (spring rolls) and pho tai bo vien.The lady who cooks was the only one working (no wait staff),and I was the only customer.The spring rolls were very good,but not quite up among my faves (think Maxim,Little Saigon,Khai Hoan).They were large,fresh and the peanut sauce actually tasted like peanuts.Regarding the pho,some may remember that this cook puts quite a bit of ground black  
pepper in the broth,almost too much.Well,she still loves the black pepper,but she's toned it down a bit.Just want to make everyone aware
of that,because other that the former Dragonfly in Mesa,nobody in metro
Phoenix puts this much black pepper in the broth.That being said,I was
pleasantly suprised with the pho.The broth was very flavorful,kinda sweet
like Maxim,yet beefy and oily (which I enjoy) like Da Vang.And while the noodles may have been a little over-cooked,the beef (which I always have
served on the side) was outstanding.I'm talking melt-in-your-mouth tender,and a generous portion to boot.The bottom line is that this was a
very satisfying bowl of pho,and I'll be back.An observation about this
restaurant...I stopped going to TuDo in part because it seemed like the
management (the lady who cooks) had lost it's enthusiasm for the business.Slow and lackadaisical service,menu items being unavailable,
and a general sense that her heart wasn't into it.Now,the service was still
slow,and some things still could be unavailable ( a couple that came in
while I was eating was told that tofu was unavailable),but the food was
very good,and she was very polite and seemed energized.Hopefully she
will get enough support for the Ritz to succeed,because there's no doubt
she is a very capable cook."}
{"text":"Just for everone's information TuDO Restaurant is now call Ritz Vietnamese Restaurant. The food is wonderful and verry good price for the portion... must try"}
{"text":"I'm disappointed to see so many bad reviews! I admit I haven't been there much over the past few years and the ownership HAS changed, but when I did go there about a half a year ago my experience was still pleasant. I have been to this restaurant many times since the early 90's and I have always enjoyed my food. The service always used to be excellent, but it did seem to faulter a little on my last visit (I hope that's not a sign that they have truly gone downhill!) 

I always eat a hot bowl of pho when I'm at Tu Do. The bowl that you receive here is much bigger and more fulfilling than many other (more expensive) restaurants. It's just the same great basics: meat, fresh basil, noodles, lime, bean sprouts, cilantro, broth (and as much spicy sauce as you can handle).

As for the atmosphere, it's always been somewhat ghetto. I've never had a problem with that, as long as they keep serving great, authentic Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"I have been going here on and off for years and have always had a good experiance. The spring rolls here are really excellent,  I always start with them and sometimes I just eat a couple orders of them for the whole meal. The curry chicken here is also a favorite."}
{"text":"Closed and re-opened.  Completely different ownership.  New place has better food, same cheap prices.  Had a bad experience with the manager, but when you can get a big bowl of good pho, so be it.  I will review under the new name after I go there again and hopefully the manager/server is gone."}
{"text":"I'm just waiting for this restaurant to appear on Ch 5's dirty dining.  I ordered your basic run of the mill Pho Tai.  The bean sprouts were slimy, the lime was rotten.  Needless to say, I didn't add anything to the soup except for some chili sauce.  It wasn't very good without basil, sprouts, etc so I only ate about 1/3 of the bowl.  Luckily I only live 30 mins away from this place because I barely made it home in time for EXPLOSIVE DIARRHEA.  I have called the Maricopa County dept of health and reported the incident.  If you value your health, stay the hell away from this place!!!"}
{"text":"Won't be long before this place goes under. Hole in the wall doesn't always mean good food. Tried the Beef Pho, hands down worst Ive ever had. Beef stock from a can with buckets of pepper poured into it. No aroma and the 'salad' was pathetic, no basil.. what's that all about? I didn't try the other dishes which might be unfair. However I will not be back to try anything else, just not worth it to me!"}
{"text":"I agree with the previous reviewer that something terrible has happened to a restaurant that used to be good. When we arrived, nobody greeted us, so we just sat at a table and waited for about 5 or 10 minutes for anyone to come to the table. The server threw a menu onto the table and then came back in a few minutes and asked us what number we wanted. She then said that they were out of some things and said that we could order from the Appetizer or Soup sections (what, no entrees?). I asked if anything at all was available from the other sections and she pointed to a few things. When she brought our food, she did not bring my daughter's order, and she didn't bring a salad that we had ordered to share. We assumed she was coming back with those, but she never came back. She stayed in the back, talking on the phone. We shared our entrees with our daughter, since she didn't have anything to eat. When we were finished, she did not bring the check - my daughter and I finally got up and went outside, and only then did she bring the check to my husband. She didn't apologize for not bringing all our food. On top of everything else, I got very sick to my stomach the next day.

My husband said that the service was non-existent - I say it was surreal. While the food tasted delicious, I think both the cleanliness and the service need to be improved."}
{"text":"Something terrible has happened to my little Tu Do. They once had the BEST food...now, it is embarrassing. I used to love their curry chicken soup. I would even make the drive just to get it when i lived far away. With memories of that curry chicken pho making my mouth water, i decided to go back again. I was a bit uneasy as I sat near enough to the kitchen to see that things here had changed. 

When i was near the kitchen before, i always caught glimpses of gleaming white floors and shiny aluminum... now, it looks dingy and disorganized. I tried to order my soup, and I'm not sure if they were out of the ingredients, or if it has been removed from the menu, but the result is the same. I didn't get any. 

The meal i did get was horrible. It was swimming in oil, the vegetables were old and tinged with brown, and the meat wasn't even edible.

I wonder what happened to the nice family that used to own the place.  It is so unlike the way it used to be that I can't even imagine that they are affiliated with it anymore."}
