{"text":"Ordered the charbroiled chicken vermicelli. Good was awesome and fresh, server was super friendly and helpful! Spring rolls are awesome too! Tacky decor though."}
{"text":"I am applled and offended. I have spent a lot of money here as it was close and convenient for me. I liked the food but ALWAYS had rude, ignorant stuck up waitresses serving me. Especially the one that kinda looks like sailor moon, thinks she's something special. I've brought many friends there and they've all commented on the horrible service and asked why do I even go. Its gotten to the point I thought this waitress knew I did something horrible to her or something. For example: when being seated she doesn't welcome you, just grabs menus tosses them down and walks away. This last time in particular, I asked for a lime for my water, she blankly stared and me and walked away, brough a lime. I said thank u very much and she just walks away. I HATE that. My friend and I also said thanks for our food she jus slams down the food and rudely walks away. (Nothing new). She brought the bill and I thought this was the rudest she has ever been, I'm not tipping. I walked up and handed her my debit card and she just stared without a word, slammed the debit machine down and stormed off to my table to grab the bill I forgot. I was now just pissed off with her attitude. She then continued to slam things around including my card into the machine. I punched in my info and \"no tipped\" her. She looked very angry, waited for the receipt and gave me mine and told me \"never come back\". I walked out shocked. I always tip for their rude service and this time I didn't, and she bans me from the store. Don't EVER go here. I've seen similar reviews. I do reccomend Balo Vietnamese downtown on 8 st and 13ave. NEVER visit vietnam fortune! You guys disgust me!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch yesterday with my roommate, as it's one of the few places that can accommodate her gluten-free, allergic to almost everything health issues. 

Service was prompt and relatively polite; we got tea, water, forks and food in quick succession. Seriously, even with the place being crowded and me being the world's slowest eater, we were still out the door within 40 minutes of arriving (essential as I had to get back to work and she had a plane to catch). 

And the food - oh, the delicious food -  was just wonderful. I had the chargrilled beef with spring roll ($9.25) and it was GREAT - lots of peanuts and sprouts, carrots and lettuce and TONS of beef which had a wonderful flavour to it. The spring roll was nice and crispy and not at all greasy; the fish sauce to pour over it was light and flavoursome. 

I even had enough leftovers for a small dinner so that, between the two meals, I wasn't hungry again until about 9:45am today! 

I'll be back a LOT I think!"}
{"text":"We were craving a noodle bowl for lunch and decided to give this place a shot as it was in walking distance. I am not adventurous at all when it comes to my vermicelli noodle bowls, I always choose a spring roll noodle bowl. with that being said, I am picky about my spring rolls and unfortunatly these ones did not hit the mark. They were very skinny and had an unexpected taste to them (cabbage?). The noodle bowl itself was nothing to rave about, no fresh herbs and no cucumber. I did not try their pho, like the other reviewer did, and I would consider going back to try that as I know some places can nail pho but be a miss on the noodle bowl (or the other way around)."}

{"text":"This is a nice quiet Vietnamese restaurant in Kensington, behind Chicken on the way.  We were a group of 3 meeting up for a late lunch.  There are a number of options including vietnamese subs, pho, vermicelli, rice, meal dishes and drinks.

Atmosphere: 3/5  The restaurant is a little inconspicuous as it is tucked away behind Chicken on the way.  It was pretty quiet when we arrived - only 1-2 other tables and one server.  Overall the restaurant is quiet, comfortable, and clean

Food: 4/5  I ordered the tamarind chicken vermicelli which I really enjoyed!  It is not something that you can get at many Vietnamese restaurants and is apparently quite authentic.  The pineapple made it really fresh.  Also not too spicy or saucy - light which I really like, and perfect portion size.  

Service: 3/5  There is only one server and unfortunately they put peanuts in my friend's vietnamese sub when he is allergic to it, and forgot his drink.  They did make the sub again.  Also it did take some time for the food to arrive, but overall friendly service.

Price: 3.5/5  Reasonable

Overall, I like the light and simple dish that I had at this restaurant and would definitely come again to try some of their other menu items!"}
{"text":"Amaze-balls! I loved it here! We were driving around as the man wanted to try out Chicken on the Way. Ugh, really? Not I, I decided that I wanted Thai or something similar instead of a box of grease. In that same plaza (yes, free parking!) where that god-awful chicken sits at 11 feet tall, there is a small hole in the wall Vietnamese place attached to the chicken place to the left. Hmmm, checked out the reviews from the first foodie site that popped up about this place on my cell phone and hey! It seemed alright, people loved it! It was not busy AT ALL there so I sauntered in, was helped right away with a take-out menu. I asked for the best items on the menu and the vermicelli noodles were pointed out straight-away. I went for #41 which is vermicelli noodles with prawn and spring roll. I noted that the restaurant was very clean, service friendly and there was a nice comfy bench for us to wait as the food was prepared. The restaurant inside is way larger than it looks from the outside. (Appeared family owned? I did not ask but I got that vibe) It was a quick wait, we may have waited 7 minutes for my food. It was a long drive home so I was hoping that the sauce for the dish was on the side so the noodles would not get soggy. Yay! It was on the side, these people know what they are doing! So, the portion was great but light, I was able to eat it all, 2 spring rolls come cut up in the dish, great size for eating with chopsticks and they were nice and crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside. The plate had a nice fresh salad, lettuce, carrots, lots of perfectly cooked noodles and the nice-sized prawns were on a skewer and were cooked perfectly. This dish cost $10.25 - worth every penny. I would have liked a little more garnish, a few nuts on top, some lime but overall I would get this a million times again and I would like to go back to Vietnam Fortune and try everything else on the menu!
While waiting for my food I asked a young Asian male on the bench waiting for his order who appeared to be a regular, if the food was good here, He replied, \"best in town\". That says a lot. Right?"}
{"text":"Love the food here! I've eaten there at least a dozen times and it's always been amazing. The food is fresh and the portions are a perfect size. It's tucked away off of 14th street right next to chicken on the way so it's easy to find with great parking. I've recommended this restaurant to many ppl and no one has ever been disappointed. Best Vietnamese in the city!"}
{"text":"I found the beef ball pho to be bland and boring. The beef tasted like it had freezer burn. Probably the worst bowl of pho I've ever had. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I've driven by Vietnam Fortune for years and walked by it on the rare occasion I crave Chicken on the Way. 

On the weekend, faced with a war on two fronts, a cold and a hangover, I remembered this bright blue Vietamese eatery and I knew that pho, and not fried chicken (that would have been a good choice the night before) would help us.

Starting with shrimp salad rolls we were impressed. Cool, crisp, crunchy and clean. The sauce on the side was also particularly savoury and the salad rolls were cut into halves so to spare you the usual awkward \"No. *You* have a second roll\" conversation.

I ordered something I had never, ever, ever seen in a Vietnamese restaurant (and I've eaten in more than a few): tamarind chicken pho. While my girlfriend had a seafood sate pho.

The tamarind chicken soup was nothing short of a miracle. Sweet, sour and a little spicy the broth swam with chunks of chicken, noodles, vegetables and tamarind itself (imagine something a little like pineapple) and while beforehand I'd have never been sold on fruit floating in my soup, I'll always order this every time from now on.

As an added plus, the broth brought me back to life before I was even halfway through the bowl.

The seafood sate lived up to it's name being both full of shrimp, squid and tons of chilis. This one had bite! 

Rejuvenated, I was happy to pay the less than $30 it cost for the two of us to win back our health. Not to mention sate our appetite."}
