{"text":"As an American Born Chinese who grew up in Chicago tasting authentic Chinese food since as long as I can remember, the food here is not the best but it satisfies my taste buds when I'm away from home. However, the drinks here, especially the slushes, are terrible! I tried the watermelon slush and it tasted awful. They do not use real fruits at all and they are overloaded with sugar. The watermelon slush tasted extremely artificial and it left a weird after taste that reminded me of medicine."}
{"text":"Bad restaurant. They tried to rob my money.  And they will persuade you to order more if they think you did not order enough. The service is ridiculously bad. Won't go back again."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre at best, but they have a decently priced lunch combo. What makes this place a turnoff is the service. I got lunch combos a few times and one time this server (who never smiles) clearly shorted me of food, it was very obvious. I complained to the cashier (never smiles) and she asked me if I want them to \"weigh the portions.\" from now on. Um, no, you never talk to a customer like that. Never going back."}
{"text":"BAD! food is bad; drink is acceptable......go there only because they open til midnight."}
{"text":"????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????WTF......"}
{"text":"The food is inconsistent. Not the worst on campus, but overpriced, greasy, salty, nothing to compare to a place like Lai-Lai. The reason I won't go back there is that I happened to be in the restroom and I saw one of the chefs (or the cooks, not sure) going out of the bathroom without washing his hands. This is unforgivable. I don't care how good their food could be but, anyway, trust me, it's not as good as to be worth this lack of hygiene."}
{"text":"I've been to China, and this food is authentic, particularly in southern China. It's best to go in larger groups where you can share the various dishes that typically contain just 1 or 2 items. If you're a Chinese student, you'll feel at home, right down to the rotating tables that make sharing food much easier. I liked the food very much, but will only go when I have 3 or more other people to go with."}
{"text":"Horrible. Used to love going to this place, but after the change of management, everything has gone downhill. Every single food we ordered was way too salty and staff was extremely rude. Do not go here if you want good Chinese food."}
{"text":"My friend and I were feeling adventurous one night and decided to order things we would not typically order from a Chinese restaurant.  He ordered twice cooked pork, and I ordered spicy schezuan fish.  Now this was a bit on the expensive side ($12 for my fish dish, I think the other dish was $8 or $9), but it was totally worth it.  Quantity wise, that fish dish was my dinner that night as well as dinner the next day.  Taste wise, it was amazing!  I wouldn't eat this every day since it is a bit heavy, but this was good!  Their bubble tea drinks are mediocre, and it is a bit pricey overall, which is why I give this place 3 stars instead of 5."}
{"text":"This restaurant serves passable chinese food, but has terrible service. Most of the staff does not speak english, which is not a problem for me, but they will treat you poorly and with a terrible attitude if you don't speak chinese.

I once went to this restaurant on a slow day with a white friend, and we were seated on the 2nd floor even though there were only 2 other parties eating on the first floor. Then the waiter ignored us for half an hour until we went to get him.

The only redeeming thing about this restaurant is they have the best bubble tea/pearl milk tea in campustown."}
{"text":"Was a regular at the place, but recently when I asked about the price of a certain dish and expressed my surprise on the expensiveness, the female restaurant owner commented that if you cannot afford to eat here, then do not come. What the actual heck? What kind of attitude is this...

Would never recommend it..."}
{"text":"The food is extremely greasy and not well cooked at times. The only decent dish amongst all the below average ones is the Kung Pao Chicken. i have mostly gone to eat here for its cheap price lunch combo (2 entrees) meal.

The ambiance is a little unhealthy, with a air of greasiness. I would suggest to sit upstairs, which is comparitively more spaced than downstairs."}
{"text":"Extremely rude and impatient, my friend and I got yelled at for not ordering enough. The food was over salted."}
{"text":"I tried this place a couple of weeks ago because I always see a line outside of it and they had a deal on Hooked, so I figured why not give it a shot. Not only was the food just mediocre, but the egg roll had raw pork in it. I even called them to let them know after I had discovered it. Luckily, I don't think I consumed any of that, but I will never be going back."}
{"text":"I've given Evo Cafe far more chances than it deserves. The food is hardly considered passable. The last time I was here, there was a piece of metal in my food. The bubble tea is alright, but most of them are made from powder anyway. The only things that are probably keeping this place going are the prime location and wide menu selection."}
{"text":"The food is not worth the price! Do not come to this restaurant. I bought a egg cost me 11.99. The price is ridiculous."}
{"text":"Five Star Bubble Tea. 

Ok, everyone is right about the food. However, that is not the prize at Cafe Evo. Now listen, I recently moved here from Oakland, CA. The Bay Area knows alot about killer bubble tea, with tapioca pearls. No one can challenge this. But let me tell you something, Cafe Evo is the only bubble tea within a two hour drive to Chicago that is worth finding. I recommend Banana, Taro, or Coconut and you have to order it as \"banana snow with pearls.\" Shake it up before you plunge the straw in, and try not to suck it all down in the car before you get back to work. I for one, have always devoured the whole thing before I can get five minutes back across town. Pitiful, but incredible. Oh, and don't expect them to be nice."}
{"text":"Evo makes the best Sichuan food in CU.  I've eaten there dozens of times, and I've had almost everything in the \"Chinese Special\", \"Water Boiled\", and \"Sichuan Special\" categories of their menu, as well as a variety of other dishes (appetizers, vegetables, noodles, etc.).  From personal experience I can say that the food at Evo is exactly like what you would get at a restaurant in Chengdu or Chongqing, China.  If you are looking for authentic Sichuan food in CU, then this is the place to get it.

A few notes on other issues:
Like others have mentioned, the service is lacking.  The basic problem is that they don't have enough servers, so the ones they have are overburdened during busy times, and exhausted during the slow time between lunch and dinner.  As a result you are better off ordering at the counter and then telling them where you are sitting, rather than waiting for a waiter.  I don't dock them a star for this because ordering at the counter is easy to do, and is not unusual for this type of restaurant (for example, at Golden Harbor you have no choice but to order at the counter).  And once you order, the food arrives quickly.

The \"fast food\" option is lackluster.  But you get what you pay for.  If you think a cheap buffet is going to give you mind-blowing food at any restaurant, you are delusional.  If you want better food, then order off the menu and pay menu prices, and that's what you'll get.

Some complain that the food is oily and salty.  Of course it is.  That's what Sichuan food is.  That's why you eat it with plain white rice.  If you don't want authentic Chinese food, you're in the wrong restaurant.

Some complain about the quality of the Beef and Broccoli or the General Tso's Chicken, or whatever.  If you want American style Chinese food, go to an American style Chinese restaurant.  Evo is about authentic Sichuan food.  Would you go to Crane Alley and order a Big Mac?


To sum up: Evo is not primarily a \"fast food Chinese joint,\" it is not an American style Chinese restaurant like Panda Express, it is not a fine dining establishment with white linen table cloths, a wine list, and a waiter with a French accent.  It is authentic Sichuan food cooked just like it is in China.  If that's what you're looking for, then this is the place for you (as attested by the huge number of Chinese students who eat there all the time).  If that's not what you're looking for, then go somewhere else and stop downrating Evo out of your own ignorance."}
{"text":"I do like the friendly people here. We went for my birthday and we only had to wait for two to three minutes. I went with Amber and Bret along with our pal who was also our driver as well."}
{"text":"The mala xiang guo (hot and spicy pot) for dinner has really authentic flavors. Especially if you get it on the most spicy level. This is coming from someone from Sichuan. Really reminded me of real Sichuan spices which is hard to come by especially in Champaign. It is although pretty pricey if you go by yourself and the restaurant is in bad shape. Essentially most things that have \"mala\" in it in this restaurant will taste pretty authentically Sichuan. If you like numbing spicy and hot food, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Decent bubble tea, well maybe the only place to get bubble tea in champaign. (nothing compared to joy yee's in the chicagoland area)

Other than that the service is terrible.  I won't go as far as to accuse them of being racist, but there is a definite difference in the way Asians and non-asians are treated. I mean they even have an exclusive VIP discounts club--the directions to join are entirely in Chinese.  Also, the men's bathroom is always filthy."}
{"text":"I don't get the low ratings for this restaurant?! what is wrong with people?! Get the guizhou chicken, young spicy chicken, sliced pig feet, water boiled fish, or any damn sichuan dish, you'll be blown away...I promise. Come on people support a good place to stay in business. 

Protip: I will tell you what this place is not for: General Tso's chicken, Orange chicken, Sweet and sour chicken and all the generic (terrible) dishes you get at the Panda Express."}
{"text":"People come here for the bubble tea and hotpot. Those are OK, but the rest of the food is wildly inconsistent. A lot of the food I've ordered has had an \"off\" taste. The bubble tea and hotpot would make up for it, but they are also quite rude here. They won't explain basic things and there have been many instances of people I know getting kicked out because they had finished their food...when there were tables free!"}
{"text":"Bubble Tea it's actually exceptionally tasty, isn't what i expected. I ordered Green Tea with pearls."}
{"text":"Big step up this semester, especially in terms of taste. Either they had a new chef or the old one just attended summer school. Definitely the best Sichuan cuisine in town now. Taste is kind of toned down to accommodate majority but you can request more spicy for greater authenticity. They also seem more careful about hygiene now with the negative reports last semester."}
{"text":"Overpriced, took 30+ minutes for them to make 2 chicken entrees and rice. They clearly don't like serving Americans, and my chicken entree was HALF full and it was $10. The chicken was dry and cheap. Avoid this place."}
{"text":"Food poisoning, worst taste of tea, worst service. Stay away from it for your life!

We a group of 4 entering Evo for some bubble tea. We ordered coconut, taro and boba. The taste of them were terrible and we could even find the powder they used to make those tea. Coconut tasted like some out-dated milk and taro tasted like sugared water. 

The servers were unhappy seeing us just order drinks, not food and they paid us the worst service ever with so negative attitude. 

The worst part is when we got home and prepared for dinner, two of us got food poisoning. They spent the whole night to calm the pain in their stomach and vomit nothing, because they had no chance to eat anything else but those Evo tea.

Please let other people read this comment, for the good of their lives!"}
{"text":"THEY ARE RACIST AND DISCRIMINATE AGAINST Non-ASIAN CUSTOMERS.  I had been here in the past and was disappointed with the service.  Today I was in a hurry and was passing by so I thought I'd give it another try.  My experience has taught me that the best Chinese restaurants around are frequented by Asians.  Look no further than Cravings and Golden Harbor to see this.  They are outstanding establishments with the best Chinese food in town.  Evo also has a strong Asian following; however, if you are not Asian you will get different service, which is what I experienced.  The employees were short with me and gave me a fraction of the food that they had given Asian students in front of me.  Outside of this post I will not make a stink about this.  I will just choose not to eat there."}
{"text":"Love the spicy fish there. The bubble tea and smoothies also taste good. Best spicy Chinese dishes around CU area. Love it. The lunch special is just so so. If you ordered anything during lunch special time, it will take at least 30 min."}
{"text":"I always get the almond bubble tea and it never lets me down.  

I really like their chili chicken dish too!  

The service isn't great, but what do you expect in a chinese restaurant haha.."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food and the \"uniqueness\" of the restaurant.  Service is a bit slow and our server needed to find someone to speak English with us. Sweet and sour soup was not salty.  Served piping hot and appeared to be vegetarian...delicious and huge portion for two to share (it was the small!). Standard green beans a bit salty but again hot and fresh.  We were talked out of the special spicy shrimp (guess he thought we couldn't handle the heat) and steered to garlic shrimp.  They were mildly spicy with an orange style sauce including bell peppers and onions.  Sautéed not fried, not salty and really good.  White rice for each of us ... kind of what a stereotypical non-Asian person would be expected to order?? Meanwhile everyone else was enjoying some awesome looking hot pots.  The fellow taking the orders at the front counter was also weighing bowls/portions of food to be cooked and sent through the window to the kitchen and sometimes loudly talking to those cooking. Entertaining."}
{"text":"?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Even as a Chinese student, I never feel the staff have basic courtesy at all. Every day they serve you with their disgusting faces as if you never pay for your bill. When I see their faces I feel no appetite. This is the Chinese restaurant that I have WORST impression. When friends ask me to go eat Chinese, I must ask whether they are going to EVO. If they say Yes, I say No."}
{"text":"When my fiancee and I went to U of I, Evo was one of our favorite restaurants. We would go there all the time for delicious bubble tea and Chinese food. I was especially found of the House Fried Rice. You would think fried rice tastes the same everywhere but the spices that Evo used and the gigantic pieces of chicken and shrimp made it out of this world.

Fast forward to a few weeks ago. We took a trip to see the campus and made sure to stop at Evo. Something has really happened to the quality of the food. Except for the bubble tea, nothing really tasted the same as when we last went to Evo, and we were pretty disappointed. If we still lived in the area, we would still go to Evo for bubble teas and the occasional meal but it would not be the regular restaurant-of-choice that it once was."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good and seems authentic enough given they draw a lot of Chinese people to eat here. I enjoyed their food but it was pretty expensive compared to the other choices on Green St. However, our waiter couldn't speak English at all and only served us water. In addition, there was a mandatory gratuity charge even though they never served us and I was only with a group of 3 total. I'd recommend places like Lai Lai Wok over this place."}
{"text":"Lunch portion is pretty though the selection sucks. Fantastic bubble tea. I've had most of the over rice dishes, again portions are solid and the quality is as good as anything else out there. Service is lackluster."}
{"text":"This restaurant throws me back. I used to go to this place all the time. It was my go to place, as it was cheep, gave me a free water for the day, and was filling. However, after the change of management, everything changed. The restaurant seemed to get meaner, as none of the staff seemed as welcoming as before. None of them could speak english very well and I didn't like the food anymore. It was too salty. I came back again after the management change to get a spicy hot wok. However, while I was choosing the ingredients for the hot pot, a person, I assume the owner, told me to add more. This was an instant turnoff as they seem to be milking the money out of me. I know what I wanted to order and I ordered enough for me. I guess this is where I leave Evo, not coming back for a while."}
{"text":"Waited 15 mins for service, 20mins to get the menu, 15 mins to order the food, 20 mins to get the first dish. I walked in at 6:30 and start on the first dish at around 8. Absolutely ridiculous. Never come to this place if you don't want to rise your blood pressure."}
{"text":"Never enjoyed the food here. The mango shake however is good. But thats not a good enough reason to go to a chinese restaurant, sorry!"}
{"text":"EVO seems to have gone downhill, but there is one thing they're doing right.

The last time I went, I tried their spicy dry hotpot (ma la xiang guo). 
If you don't know what it is, try it.
If you know what it is, order it.
It's amazing, delicious, and about $22 a serving (good for 2 people).

I've tried it at other Chinese restaurants on campus and EVO's is by far the best."}
{"text":"The bubble tea is pretty good.  I'd often stop here after class and grab one to bring back home.  Food-wise, they're average for what else you'll find around in Champaign/Urbana.  

That being said, unfortunately the service here leans toward poor/fair if you're white.  There, I said, it.  I'm not taking it back.  I've been here multiple times with my buddies and we were ignored or hardly waited on.  That would be understandable if we were loud or obnoxious, but we were 4 quiet white guys.  

One time we went in, were seated, and nobody came to take our order.  I went up to the counter after about 15 min to ask if we could order.  In broken English I was told that someone would be there to take our order.  After another 5-10 minutes of waiting we decided to just up and leave.  Awesome."}
{"text":"Didn't get a chance to try the food. But the service is rude and sucks needed a quick lunch since on break and walked in watched the cashier or owner whoever she is taking an order from a customer being VERY rude ..after he ordered it was my turn waited 15 minutes until she noticed me. (She saw me when I came in) asked if they had the lunch special she said no (understandable since its the weekend ) . Told her J needed to then look at the menu. Looked at the menu for 10 minutes but took another 15 for her to notice me (she was right there just making tea ) . Then told me I had to wait 40 min for a general tsos chicken and BBQ fried rice...walked out. Not going back."}
{"text":"Loved some of their food although they are expensive as hell. The biggest turn-off is super-rude behavior of nearly everyone who works there.  The waiter (who happened to the same person at the register sometimes) literally throws food items on the table without uttering a single 'enjoy your meal' or 'thank you' . The gesture almost indicates they are pissed off that I showed up in there to eat !"}
{"text":"The bubble tea here is simply amazing! I am from California, where they have tons of bubble tea places. However, Evo Cafe supplies the most amazing bubble tea I have ever ingested! 

They have a wide variety of bubble tea ranging from milk tea to slushies. They also have boba and many different types of jellies to go with your drink. 

This place has become one of my favorites to get my milk tea fix."}
{"text":"I ordered a spicy noodle soup and I got beef intestines soup with a magma hot chili oil broth base.  I feel like I ordered wrong here.  I probably should try this place again however it was not cheap.  Most of the menu is in Chinese so I had a hard time dissecting the menu.  I'm not a huge fan of intestines so I did not really like my meal too much, especially because it was only noodle and intestines."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I had the dry pot. It was bomb!!!!! So authentic and I got the exact flavor I expected. It was spicy, a little oily but totally acceptable. You can get a lot of asian veggies there. But the seaweed cold dish and the bubble tea tasted weird. 





So far my favorite Chinese restaurant on campus. Authentic Chinese food, just a little bit oily and salty"}
{"text":"Wow.  Should have read the reviews and stuck to the tea.  I had the lo mein looking noodles, spicy \"young' chicken and general tso.  The only thing I could get down was the noodles.  I went in because the place was packed with Asian students so I'd figure it was worth a shot.  Now I'm not feeling to good.  Note to self:  read yelp reviews first!"}
{"text":"Very mediocre food but absolute rude attitude.
Went once with bunch of friends and went upstairs.
Waiter silently threw down the menu and walked away.
Has to call like 3 times for them to show up again to get the order."}
{"text":"Evo?! The biggest fighting game tournament of the year? No, doesn't look like it. Instead, it's a fast food Chinese joint. I have to say that their lunch special isn't a special at all since the amount of food you get is equivalent to any other Chinese fast food joint at the same price. However, I will say that what makes them unique is that they do serve tofu and a scrambled egg/tomato dish which I've never seen before in the myriad fast food Chinese places I've been to. It's also neat that the water bottles are free too."}
{"text":"Food was okay.  The smoked tofu with celery and pork shreds was okay, but underseasoned.  The spicy boiled beef was also just okay.  Not terrible - we ate the whole thing - but nothing to write home about, either.  Not thrilled with the obvious clumping from excess corn starch, either.

They do have lots of space, and can be good for groups, and their milk tea with boba was good.  I'd go again, but  it's not worth going out of your way for, by any means."}
{"text":"I've never had the food here, but the smoothies are tops. The cappuccino is my favorite, and though I LOVE tapioca in my smoothies, this is one time I'll skip it just because it distracts me from how amazing the flavor is!

I always order before I see the sign near the counter advertising peppermint... It sounds pretty bizarre, but still, I'm intrigued."}
{"text":"Not a super good spicy Chinese food restaurant but fair enough."}
{"text":"After trying a few Chinese places around Campustown, I decided that I liked this place over the others. I really enjoy their orange chicken, the mongolian beef, and the beef with broccoli. Their sichuan food is also worth trying. The atmosphere is okay and the service is acceptable. My complaint is that the price is a little more than others but my favorite dishes taste better here than elsewhere so I am fine with that."}
{"text":"Alright food, alright drinks. Not really a place I'd stop by for gourmet food but still pretty okay. I'm not a fan of making drinks from syrups or powders but it is challenging to keep a full stock of fresh fruits and vegetables when smoothies aren't incredibly popular in America yet."}
