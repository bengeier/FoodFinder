{"text":"I want to thank Gino's for their good service and food. I stay fours days in Pittsburgh and had Gino's every night.  Food good but keys things missing that won't make me come back next time I through.  1. Frid wings to greasy ( overlooked) -1 2. Baked ziti will fill you. (Little favor)-1 3. No cheese wiz for frys Just cheese-1 4. Calzone like 8-10 in for $12/w tax -1  Pros  Pizza good ( addicting) Provolone sticks . App  Spin and chicken pie with white sauce   Good beer selection. Try Sick Day..!!!   So only for them flaws Gino's for everyday  of service. You  food variation could be better. I shall take stars away from. You should be consistent in flavor for us to enjoy and make us come back. You  should have great  quality food for the price."}
{"text":"The calzone with chicken and spinach was awesome!!! Wings are always super, but the sauce on the raviolis is unbelievable ! I always get delivery and always a good experience"}
{"text":"Whilst the food is good the service in the bar side is lackluster. The young bar staff whilst rushing around looking busy in a half empty room do take care of the regulars, whilst not a real regular myself my business has me in the area often and not having transport this is a place I visit very often. That said they fail to notice new people coming in. Even after I got up from the table ( and there are only 6 and 10 bar seats )and ordered a drink from the bar she still failed to come and take a food order until after ten minutes and that was after I flagged down someone else. Like I said the food was good, hot and prompt but another 12 minutes of sitting at a table with empty plates and an empty glass I still had to get a drink order from yet another passing member of staff. The original girl left but the one that took over was no better, if she had more of an awareness and just looked at her tables she'd notice more.  Don't get me wrong not all the staff are like this, I've had many a higher rated meal here but they need to have a bit more of a customer orientated business that is consistent and an awareness of everyone that walks in."}
{"text":"Order a buffalo chicken pizza. It was made with deep fried chicken tenders--gross. It didn't have much flavor.   The server tries her best, but she's stuck tending the bar and waiting tables.   You'll pay more, but there's better pizza at la Capella at the Waterworks."}
{"text":"Went here with friends that suggested pizza and beer Saturday. While the beer selection was very good (even had Stella Artois on tap) we found the pizza just so-so. The toppings were good but there was something very strange about the sauce. It had the consistency of tomato paste and tasted like the pepper shaker had been emptied into the sauce. So I guess if we just wanted a drink we would stop in again but not for the pizza."}
{"text":"My wife and I are visiting from another state and we're staying near by and saw this place on yelp. It had decent reviews so we wanted to try it out. By far the worst service I've ever experienced. We ordered 4 slices of pizza, 3 were literally cold. When we asked for our check we waited for 20 minutes to get our card back. Never again."}
{"text":"The marinara has some very addictive quality. I went here two nights in a row. The first night, I walked from my hotel trying to find some non-fast food option close by. The hotel receptionist actually recommended a different hotel's restaurant, but it was smoke filled (I'm from Austin and you just don't smoke in bars or restaurants) and I waited for 10 minutes at the hostess station and was no one acknowledged I was there.   So, I walked out, wandered around and in a tiny strip mall I spotted the Gino Bros. sign. They have an extensive menu for different pizzas with numerous options, including gourmet toppings. In addition to the many pizza options, they have salads, gyros, hoagies, pasta, and calzones. I ordered the manicotti and the portion was HUGE. I was in awe and said, \"WOW\" really loudly when the server passed me my plate. Some gentlemen in the restaurant thought my reaction was laughable, but that's how surprised at my plate of manicotti.   The next night, my rugby team was looking for a place to hold team dinner. We recommended Gino Bros. Seven of my teammates shared two extra large pepperoni pizzas. They loved every bite and there was nothing leftover. I don't eat meat so I ordered the eggplant parmigiana. Again, the portions were HUGE. I had tons leftover and shared them with teammates the next day. Everyone agreed that it was delicious.  My reason for only giving four stars is the salads are only made up of iceburg lettuce. A teammate ordered a Greek salad which should be made up of romaine lettuce, but she got the drab iceburg. She ate it nonetheless, but I guess I am a bit of a lettuce snob.   Affordable, delicious, and extra large portions. Can't ask for much more except bourgie greens."}
{"text":"Worst pizza my lips have touched short of campiti's near banksville road. Sauce is generic, the crust is generic, and the cheese is iffy at best. Save your money and the hour and a half it takes for them to deliver it. Good day."}
{"text":"The Worst!! I ordered a mini pizza and a small garden salad, to go. I got cardboard and a packet of Marzetti Pre-Packaged salad dressing!! 2 stars only 'cause they serve booze."}
{"text":"I love their Hawaiian white pizza and buffalo fries! Their portions are large and fairly well priced. They have great happy hour specials too!"}
{"text":"Had a 'famous' Philly cheesesteak tonight. It was ok nothing fantastic. Pizzas look awesome that others are eating. I would come back and get a pizza. Men's room hadn't been cleaned in a while. Nice waitresses"}
{"text":"Me, my wife,and my 16 month old child were not served because we made their head bartender Lacy uncomfortable. Do not eat here. How do babies make employees feel uncomfortable?"}
{"text":"Love Gino's pizzas! Their Buffalo Chicken pizza is the best in town and they're huge!"}
{"text":"This place is cute and nice. Take a boy and watch some sports.   The food is really great bar food. Loads of beer choices, wing flavors, sandwiches and salads.  The service was fantastic. They had two servers covering our table so we were always taken care of. I would come again and chill here.   It's a drink for a couple hours kind of place. Not too loud, not too dark ( big windows!), and very clean."}
{"text":"My occasion for visiting Gino's was tied to a room block at a local hotel. It's a great place within walking distance to a few of the local hotels.  The menu is standard pub fare (with an obvious specialty in pizza) and plenty of beers to choose from. The pub is split between the standard restaurant style seating and the bar so you're not necessarily stuck eating at the bar if you don't want to.  I'm hardly ever near Pittsburgh but I'd definitely go here again with the friendly and polite staff pushing this place over the top."}
{"text":"I have ordered many pizzas and hoagies from this place. Always good and the staff is always kind. I will always recommend this place if you want friendly atmosphere, good pizza, and some sports."}
{"text":"I loved the chicken and spinach pizza.  The waitress did a great job.  My new favorite pizza place."}
{"text":"The wingdings are my favorite thing ever. Only suggestion: offer to toss them in sauce. I like the crunch plus the sauciness. Fun atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Service is good, nice and swift! Large portions so it will definitely be something to take home and enjoy tomorrow...food is generous and tasteful like momma made it! Can't wait to next visit!"}
{"text":"There is not that many options for food when in the greater Harmerville area, especially if you are at the Alpha Ice Arena (formerly Bladerunners). I've been here a few times and have found this to be a better than average Pizza place.  The pizza is pretty good as are the wings and salad. The staff has been extremely attentive and friendly each time I have been in. They have a small bar and restaurant area. Numerous TVs. A decent beer selection as well.   Given the area I consider this a pretty good place to go, with food that is better than the local Primantis, and likely less busy to boot."}
{"text":"Service remains atrocious. Food was good, but again, one waitress.  I am known as a very good tipper, but no more.   Service industry folks, take notice: going forward I tip based on the service that I receive.  That does not mean an automatic 20-30%."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Gino's added a bar, great atmosphere, very clean, and best Happy Hour! Monday-Friday 5pm to 7pm 50% off all drinks! Great for hotel guest!"}
{"text":"Walked in just before 10 tonight and the bartender wasn't sure if the kitchen was open. She left and didn't come back. We went over to the kitchen and the woman in the kitchen said they were still open for food. We asked The bartender about the beer list and she told us to go look in the cooler for ourselves. She continued to ignore us and act as though we were an intrusion so we left."}
{"text":"Great service.   Great pizza.  On time delivery.   Will go back.   Had 10 xlg pizzas delivered to Founders Field for after the rugby tournament.  Everything went smoothly and pizzas were hot and delicious.  The boys and coaches were very happy."}
{"text":"Third time is a charm, NOT! Ordered pasta the first time, couldn't eat it. Pizza the second time and it was OK, nothing special. Tonight went for the sausage hogie. Obviously frozen generic sausage-at an Italian place-really?-on an over toasted roll with hardly any sauce. Fries were greasy limp and the salad was OK if you're into using packets of dressing. I couldn't finish any one item.  The waitress/bartender forgot to charge me for a beer, which I pointed out, she didn't say a word, no thank you or sorru, nothing. Tonight's special, according to the menu was burgers, but they no longer offer burgers...?"}
{"text":"Thursday night pizza from Geno's makes working the night shift worth it! We started finishing off our work week by treating ourselves to some pickup. Can't go wrong with anything on the large menu. This pizza is among the elite that Pittsburgh has to offer. That Meat Lovers pizza! Ugh!  They have a nice sit-in lounge area too with great lunch and happy hour specials.  Pizza pizza??? Geno's."}
{"text":"This is a great, cheap place to eat and drink in this area. Nothing fancy but very kind/fast service. They had drink specials on a Saturday night. The kitchen is open super late.   Easy walking distance from the Hampton Inn and Suites or Marriott."}
{"text":"Rare 1 star for me... sadly last 2 of 3 visits were not great.  Tonight... our food and the tables beside us literally all had bad food and bad service.   Food actually and literally came ice cold (frozen spinach in calzone) - supposed to be hot pizza.  REALLY like this place but sadly cant recommend after last several visits."}
{"text":"Don't bother eating in, you're not missing out...unless staring at uncleared tables is your thing. Just call in your pizza(s), etc. and pick it up. It's hard to stand out in the packed pizza world, but Gino Bros is a solid 'go to' option in the Harmarville/Oakmont area."}
