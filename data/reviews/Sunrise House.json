{"text":"This is likely one of the most casual/no frills restaurants in Koreatown but the food is delicious  - the service is quick and they are generous with side dishes which I think is some of the best in Ktown in terms of flavor (not presentation).   The staff are always kind but don't expect exceptional service as this is a place where you go to get a fast and inexpensive meal- with most entrees (including 6 side dishes) at approx. $8, it's the best value of any restaurant in Toronto!  The food is always very fresh and always made to order...enjoy :)

The kimchi or tofu stew are good options.  The sizzling platters can be a little greasy but so tasty : )"}
{"text":"Really friendly staff and I love the food here  yummy as heck!

The side dishes are always fulfilling and I can't get enough of their spicy kimchi with pork"}
{"text":"Sunrise House is a place you love for what it is, not what it isn't. The service is quick, the food is good, and most dishes are $8 or $9. The banchan, or free side thingies, are fresh and plentiful, and some of my favourite on the Koreatown strip. The side dishes staples seem to be cabbage, cucumber, and radish kimchi, potatoes, beansprouts, seaweed and glass noodles. Best of all, they're included if you order take-out. 

The menu is populated with cheap, solid renditions of standard Korean dishes. The stir-fries are spicy and meat-heavy. The bibimbap is fresh tasting, and a generous portion. The stews are excellent winter comfort food, full of everything from dumplings to hot dogs. I would order steamed shrimp dumplings instead of chicken, as the chicken is sometimes dry, but don't skip the seafood pancakes. They're are all fried well enough to frightened your cholesterol, but inescapably delicious. 

That being said, this place is cash only, often has a line-up (but nowhere to wait), and indifferent service unless you become a regular and tip. Also, the walls are cartoon nuclear reactor green, and the restaurant is decorated with seasonal ornaments that needed a place to retire."}
{"text":"Great Korean home cooking.  After having lived in Korea for a bit, it's nice to come across a place in Canada that's pretty close to the real thing.

The decor is minimal but the food is delicious.  Their kam ja tang for two is an excellent deal and they add a lot of veggies to the pot, which was very much appreciated.  One of the best things about this place is that banchan (small side dishes) are plentiful (they gave us 6 instead of the usual 3 or so you will get from other restaurants) and unlimited. 

The service was also really good.  The food came quickly and the server was very attentive.  Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Had a craving for the cold noodle at Na Deul Mok for dinner before I went for a haircut at Maya. Walked out of Christie Station to find out it was closed for some odd reason. Shrugged and walked along to my backup choice that I'd been meaning to try.

Came in, was immediately seated and presented with a menu. Ordered. Sat down with a biography of Chretien ready to leisurely wait for my food. ~8 minutes later, my banchan came. Another minute later, my bulgogi bibimbap came. Man, that was fast! 

Decent selection of banchan (potatoes, some greens, noodles, kimchi, bean sprouts, eggplant). The bibimbap was nothing too special though. For the price however ($8), I was more than happy to dig in.  After I took my time eating it, I was presented with the bill and surprised to find that it was still just $8 (no tax!?). I left a tenner anyway and felt so much better for leaving a 25% tip rather than 10%.

I feel compelled to come back to this place to try out more of its menu. They don't use any MSG and their prices are very, very reasonable especially when you weigh in the banchan with your main dish (saw L.A. Kalbi advertised on the wall for 9.99 amongst other deals such a meal for 2 for $15)."}
{"text":"Hands down! I would say it's the best place in Korea town! I love their stews. My gf and I go there every week! People are nice there even though it's kind of pack."}
{"text":"Sunrise is definitely a place you will easily miss while walking by, except for the almost constant lineups out the door. 

The place is on the small side and really packed in but the food is totally worth it. The service is so so. I understand they are busy but they only provide the bare minimum of service (take order, serve food and clean up). The one time we were there, we waited over 20 minutes for our order to be taken and they repeatedly walked right past our table. 

The food is delicious. Lots of small Korean side dishes to go with your meal and the selection of side dishes are pretty decent. 

Naturally I got the traditional bibimbap. It was delicious and has lots of ingredients. You can add as much sauce as you want. 

The dumplings were so so. Tried it, I feel the Chinese ones tasted better. But at least these ones were fried up nicely. 

The potato pancake was also so so. OK texture and taste. Again trying something different, since my dinner mate didn't want seafood in the pancake.

Overall, for the price, the food was very reasonable. At least the main dishes."}
{"text":"Loved it! Great bibimbap and we got 6 appetisers twice!! Tasty food and cheap. Nice fast service. We were very happy with this Yelp find."}
{"text":"I'm still very new to Korean cuisine so I'm not too sure how everything should taste but I found everything good! I ordered the stir fried bulgogi with vegetables and squid. I liked the squid but I probably would not order the beef again. I loved their kimchi though (and the noodle banchan I can't remember what its called)! It's a quaint little restaurant but the service was fast. Once you're done eating here you should definitely go across the street and top off your meal with some walnut cakes at Hodo Kwaja"}
{"text":"I gave myself the challenge of trying every Korean restaurant along Bloor West. I did. Sunrise House beats them all easily! The food is so tasty, the menu has the right diversity, the service is quick, and the side dishes are endless! I have also tried most items in the menu, and have not been underwhelmed once. 
They usually have a lineup, so I recommend showing up in off-peak hours to avoid a cold wait outside (esp. in winter). They take cash only, but there's an ATM in the convenience shop next door."}
{"text":"I go here and want to put everything in my face. The service can be a bit hit and miss, but usually because it's ridiculously busy and there are only one or two waitresses doing their best. Great Value as a purchase of a $7.50 stew will feed you and a guest. My personal fav is the pork and kim chee soft tofu stew, although I've dabbled with the pancakes and dumplings and found them just as good. Worth the wait!"}
{"text":"The best Korean joint I've ever been to.  Reasonably priced, great selection and good service. The only downside is how small it is, sometimes you have to wait for a seat. It's cash only too so don't forget to bring bills.  Now on to the food. I highly recommend the beef/squid/kimchi bulgolgi and the beef short ribs. I haven't tried the bimbap here but I've seen lots of happy looking Korean people chowing down on it! I really don't think you can go wrong at this place."}
{"text":"Stumbled into this place one night. Nice little place. Ordered just bulgogi and dumlings to share amongst ourselves and I was really surprised by the amount of side dishes they gave us. The table was full of them. There were a wide range of them and the kimchi was really good. They said they made it themselves when I asked. Really good Korean place."}
{"text":"A bunch of websites have mentioned that this is a must-visit Korean restaurant in Toronto. As well-known as this restaurant was, it was very busy and we had to wait for an hour until we were able to sit down. We were excited as we waited for the food, but this whole place soon turned into a disappointment. Ok, so foods overall were not bad, even though they tasted overly like black pepper and Ramyun soup powder. However, tofu in soft tofu soup was sour, and additionally there was no A/C in this place IN MID-JULY so it was hot as Hades! Lastly, the service was not good; we had to wait and ask a waitress to bring us cups and water, and had to ask whenever we needed water refill. Tbh they need to hire another waitress or something for busy-hours. :/"}
{"text":"Ohhh, yes.  Hot tofu stew on a cold winter's day?  Sign me up!  The service the day we went was spotty: we didn't get refills on our banchan, and we had to wait a bit for the check, but the food was tasty and so filling."}
{"text":"A lot of people already talked about the big portion and affordable price so I'm not going to go into it. This review focuses on service and the little things.

First, service can be slow as there is usually one waitress running the entire store. IT can take a while to get your order taken after you sit down, as there are two tables uncleaned and two tables worth of patrons waiting in line. It's also somewhat of a grudge to get your water/banchan refills. 

Today they even got my order wrong, outing to try something new I didn't return it, but I knew I was not a big fan of dumplings so I didn't order anything with it. Long n behold they give me a stew with three large dumplings. I took one bite of them and left the rest in the bowl. But they don't usually get it wrong.


In terms of the small things, these are what captures my attention to return - the napkins they use here are not the cheap two-fold one plys you get from most other cheap restaurant/diners/coffee shops. Instead sunrise house use a 4-fold square napkin(like one you would expect from a $$ restaurant. Not only that, the kind they use here is a nicer version with more puffiness and softer than most counterparts. definitely a plus.

The other small things is their soup take out container. It is one of the sink-in styrofoam lids that does an excellent job of sealing the soup in. Generally speaking I expect soup/liquid to leak from my takeout container. Not with sunrise. The only container above these are those reusable, microwavable, transparent plastic ones with a super-tight lid. But those container only comes from more expensive restaurants."}
{"text":"This was the only restaurant that was full as we were walking towards the restaurant on a raining night. People were coming in non-stop, individuals even waited as long as 20 mins for a seat... Consider so many \"near-empty\" restaurant nearby. This definitely means something !

Small cozy place, great side dishes, good price.
We ordered the spicy kimchi hot pot, it was big and cheap.
Taste is average, but for the same dish in Joons, the cost will be at least twice as much, with a smaller portion (thou it has more meat).

Only one waitress worked that night, two chefs in the kitchen. Everyone was working non-stop. Thank you very much for the food and service! We'll definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Great place for students. You have a huge selection (really, a bit of every kind of korean food) at a very reasonable price. I went around 3 times and I was only dissatisfied with once (my bulgogi was very salty but my dad really enjoyed his noodles so I guess they just screwed up my order).

Unfortunately the place is tiny so it's often difficult to get a seat. It's also a bit of a jack of all trades. Lots of selection but I wouldn't say they do a particular dish very well."}
{"text":"Price of food is good minus the exorborant price on soju and maegkoli, 15 bucks and 18 when they are around 1 to 4 dollars in Korea. I tried the gam ja tang and it wasn't authentic (lives 5 yrs in Korea). It has no potatoes, Nor veggies and broth was not correct. Pajang was great along with kimchi and other side dishes (banchan). Good service too. Would try other places before going back,"}
{"text":"Big portions, lots of sides and cheap! Came here in the summer, and there was no AC which was the only negative"}
{"text":"The owners have changed. Since the change, the food has become lower and lower in quality while prices keep rising every few months or so. Understandable if it's due to inflation, but obviously not the case if prices increase only over a few months! I've had most of my usual dishes here since before the turnaround, ranging from spicy pork and kimchi stirfry to the summer's seasonal cold noodles. I was always impressed with the cleanliness of the place as well as the extremely tasty dishes and sides (banchan), but I can't say this anymore. The new owners do not take care of the cooking, while the old owners were owner-chefs. Perhaps they hold different perspectives on what they want to prioritize. I returned a couple of times after the change and tried their beef bulgogi dish as well as their dumpling soup, and both were subpar in quality. The beef was too sweetened and tough/stringy, while the dumplings were the frozen cheap type and the soup base was super watered down. 

I don't think I'll return here again nor recommend it anymore as the best korean restaurant in ktown to my colleagues or friends. Very disappointed about how the place has completely changed."}
{"text":"The food was so good I had to say \"this is so good\" after each bite! Delicious food, friendly staff, cold beer, what else do you need? The decoration is not fancy but it's very authentic. Yes maybe they can start renewing their water bottles but overall it's a place I want to go back!"}
{"text":"Extremely poor service! We were three people and were forced to wait while there were SEVERAL tables empty! Unacceptable!"}
{"text":"I heard this is a very famous restaurant so I asked my Korean friends to take me there.
We arrived at 6pm but it was already crowded.
We ate hotpot and Korean-style pozza. My friends said they tasted the same as in Korea. I thought they were really tasty."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place to satisfy my Korean food cravings! I love this place so much that I would spend $6 on TTC to get there for a $10 tofu stew. Their bibimbaps are tasty, stews are hearty and their side dishes are flavourful and plenty. This place is quite small, so do expect to wait in line if you go during the normal lunch and dinner time. But in my opinion, it's worth it."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times- more than a year ago; had always ordered the same non spicy, Bulgogi (Korean beef) with rice. Tonight I decided to order the same dish but a take-out. It was busy but not packed like it used to and I waited about half an hour. My mistake is I did not 
open the container to check. When I got home, what I got was some kind of squid pancake. 
It was either the lady punched in the wrong dish or  I got someone else's order . I am so disappointed and still feel really cheated, because I was looking forward to beef & rice not squid,  and least of all pancake.   I tried calling their number but it is not even initialized.

Finally is the squid pancake good? Well, a bit too salty for me, too many potatoes, onions which I am not crazy about. Very few squids so if you like it. this dish for $11+tx is not worth it which was what it cost me.

If I ever order take-out again I will definitely 1: clarify what the dish is (description), 2: order it 3: after receiving the container, open and check  4: make sure to get a receipt before leaving which I did not get either!"}
{"text":"Remember cash only!
Their portion is a lot so good for until the next meal. Tried their hot pot, rice, noodle. Decent and enjoyed. They can be a bit salty."}
{"text":"Very good place?food here is very good?i like the beef soup ?rice cake?and bibibab. I come here every week?some times is too busy?i need to wait long time."}
{"text":"To echo Heidi's comment, I saw the man there yell at his employees. A girl started to cry... and I felt so horrible. It was really awkward for the people trying to enjoy their food. 

The food wasn't that great. I ordered the Bibimbop with Tofu, and the tofu was not cooked and had a fishy smell to it.... The side dishes were also disappointing- they were just too salty and I found myself drinking glasses of water. 

I don't think I will go back there. :("}
{"text":"I normally go to the place next door for lunch but they were busy so I decided to give this place a try.  Ordered pork stew on my first try.  Service seems to be quick and it wasn't busy at all during Sunday lunch time.  Banchan were served with the stew, while banchan were decent, stew itself was disappointing.  The meat is tender and soft alright, but the broth itself doesn't have much favour.  In fact, it tastes kind of bland.  I don't think the pork bones were stewed long enough so I don't taste any flavour in it.  It's like dumping pork bone into some chilly water.  Very disappointing.
I've never been to this place before but I've noticed it is Chinese owed now, not sure if it has anything to do with the quality.  The price is cheap but so are some other places in the area.  Not sure if I'll visit again."}
{"text":"We randomly picked this spot, and I came in hungry and excited for all the yummy side dishes and a hot stone bibimbap, and these were both totally underwhelming. Kim chi wasnt crunchy and nothing looked or tasted really fresh. Lets not talk about the delicious potato salad you usually get...cos this was 3 potatoes and a carrot alongside soggy beansprouts, some wierd noodles....

Our waitress took ages to take our order and when my friend asked if they served Hite beer, (korea's premiere beer) she acted like she had no idea what she was talking about. Onto the food, which arrived quick but wasn't really stellar either. I've had much better bibimbap elsewhere and my friends soft tofu seafood soup was ok, but the seafood looked pretty sketchy. Im not even going to talk about the pork bone soup because it was just a bone pretty much topped with beans and the actual soup didnt taste like much. Never had it before so not sure what it should taste like, but I wouldnt have it again based on this one. 

Ready to leave, we asked for the check, and when it didn't come, we asked again...at which point I'm pretty sure the waitress' slow and subpar service was deliberate. 

Long story short....not coming back here again. Ever."}
{"text":"Been going here for years! It's my go-to spot for affordable Korean food. 
I always get the Kimchi Chigae (tuna/pork, whatever I feel like) and definitely taste the improvement over the years. I always think I'll try something else, but end up getting this stew no matter what season. There hasn't been a single dish here where I didn't like it (tried pretty much 70% of menu by now).

Banchan are very generously given and refilled upon request - delicious. Depending on who it is, service can be a hit or a miss... the food makes up for it though. Around peak hours, the place is packed and generally there's a bunch of people waiting to get seats. Well worth it though."}
{"text":"Busy on an early Sunday evening and then line ups out the door. Decent flavourful classic Korean dishes for a great price. The two person specials seemed popular, like gam ja tang (pork bone soup) hotpot for two for $14.99! Six banchan were served and had good flavours...not the tired ones that you sometimes see being brought out again and again at some restaurants. Especially enjoyed their seaweed salad.

Beers are 3-4 dollars a bottle tax included depending on choice of import or domestic. A bottle of Hite was $3.50 taxes included.  We ordered steamed shrimp dumplings, but panfried ones came. We weren't fussy and they were still good, so that hiccup was overlooked. Seafood soon tofu stew was a flavourful mild-medium spiced bubbling little pot of goodness. Only wish the seafood tasted fresher and not from frozen, but no sand and no bad seafood tastes meant this one was still a cut above average. 

Everything looked and smelled good. Prices were right. Definitely coming back to try the gam ja tang that I saw so many tables order."}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant in Korean Town. We eat there every week and never got disappointed"}
{"text":"Great prices and excellent korean food! Also comes with UNLIMITED banchan dishes (6 choices). I absolutely love the pickled cucumber and carrot dish. Does anyone know what that is called?! lol. The only downer is the appearance of this place. But, for the price you really can't complain. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I've tried many of the restaurants in Korea Town, but I think Sunrise house is the absolute best. If you've ever been here on an evening, you can definitely tell how popular it is since there's usually a lineup outdoors.

The first time I came here, I ordered the Kalbi and the Kimchi stew. I truly believe Sunrise house has the best Kimchi stew I've ever tasted, so I'd highly recommend that. The Kalbi was absolutely delicious. I've tried a few other dishes here, the bulgogi, seafood udon, dumplings and so far I've never been disappointed.

Price wise, I feel like this is one of the best places to get a cheap meal around 6-8 bucks. The portions are pretty large and I always leave the restaurant with leftovers.

My only complaint is the service. There's typically one waitress trying to serve the entire restaurant. You absolutely need to use the doorbells on the table to get the waitresses attention sometime. But honestly, the price and the food make it worth it!

If you're looking to try a new place in Ktown, this is definitely it!"}
{"text":"Sunrise House was recommended to me by the owner of the store where I bought a traditional Korean pillow.  I asked her where I'd be able to eat a good and delicious kalbi.  The lady was so nice, she even lead me to that restaurant as I presumed she didn't know the English name of the place.  It is quite a small place run by a family.  Not only was the Kalbi tasty but so did all the side dishes and soup.  The cucumber kimchi was very good together with the seaweed and glass noodles.  I had to ask for second helpings of the later.  By the time I was in the middle of eating my Kalbi, the restaurant was completely full.    The soup was also very tasty.  They do give you 6 banchan dishes and their kimchi is seasoned not to bite you.  Spicy enough but not too hot to burn your tongue.  I think 2 people can share an order of kalbi plus one seafood pancake or one order of something else.  Service was excellent.  They also do take out."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of the better Korean restaurants in Christie and bloor.

Very reasonable prices, good service, and delicious food. 

The BBQ short rib is tasty, and their stews are very good, too!

I recommend Sunrise house to those who are looking for affordable and cozy Korean cuisine."}
{"text":"I love this place, from the food to the side dishes. Very filling and very good.
The service was quick, food came rolling out at a reasonable pace. 
Will come here again. Also ordered take out for my fiancé, they also included the side dishes as well unexpected,"}
{"text":"Sunrise is my favourite Korean restaurant. The food is always delicious and great portion. The service is pretty quick but they accept cash only so it is a bit inconvenient sometime."}
{"text":"Good, reasonable Korean food. Cash only.
Large selection, very popular, wait time can be long especially on Weekend's dinner time.
Customer Service is tolerable.
One time, they gave us the food, which apparently not what we ordered.
We were not aware of this as we are not too familiar with different types of Korean dishes.
So we ate it, next our \"real\" order came, we are charged for both dishes.
Yes, sucks, good thing the foods taste good. 
We tried hard not to feel too bad about paying an extra dish we didn't order."}
{"text":"Sunrise has great food and totally worth the money. Although it's a bit small for a restaurant, the food is packed with flavour. I ordered a dolsot bibimbap and it honestly was worth like $9 I paid. It was loaded with vegetables and cooked perfectly, not over or under seasoned. My meal also came with numerous side dishes like kimchi and potatoes. 

It has a great selection of dishes and all of it is authentic Korean home style cooking. The servers were really nice. This place is a great to drop by for lunch or dinner and I will definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Really fresh, very tasty, homemade Korean food, super friendly service and I don't think they use lots of MSG like some other Korean restaurants."}
{"text":"This is def my favorite place for Korean food from now on. Their LA beef ribs was the best Korean ribs I have ever had. Their price is also very cheap! Their pork bone soup is also excellent and big portion !"}
{"text":"A very good meal for an amazing steal! We had to wait a couple minutes, not because all the tables were full but because the restaurant had no clue how to seat the customers. Single individuals occupied tables meant for four, instead of being seated at tables for two.  Fortunately, the wait was quick and we were soon seated.

I ordered a shrimp bibimbap, and priced at only $9, it was a huge and massive portion! The shrimp is only slightly salted, so if you want something stronger in taste, order another dish. But I really enjoyed the huge assortment of vegetables! The rice was perfectly crispy against the hot dolsot, though I'm embarrassed to say that I left most of it untouched because I was too full.

My mom's spicy squid bibimbap was just as substantial in size, and the squid was marinated nicely! Based on these two orders, I would definitely recommend you order the bibimbap as the quality and portion size appear to be consistent.

My sister ordered the non-spicy bibimbap but it came quite sickening sweet. The portion, again, was massive! There was a hill of rice along with a mountain of stir fried beef. We packed most of this to go.

We also ordered a seafood pancake to share, but this was a disappointment. Not only was it the most expensive order at $10 (I realize how obscene that sounded LOL), but it was thick and doughy, completely lacking the crisp typical of most Korean pancakes. That being said, there was a significant amount of squid and cuttlefish in the pancake!

The place was super busy, and the server never even got the chance to refill our cups with tea. The banchan is amazing, and homemade, though I found the japchae to be a bit too sweet. Will come again!"}
{"text":"Good family-owned Korean restaurant in the Annex. Ordered two dishes and the bill came out to under $20. For cheap and decent korean food, I recommend coming here. The decor is very basic so if that is a key factor for you then you are out of luck."}
{"text":"Great taste, plentiful portions, and prompt service make this little nook a must-visit when you're in the hood. WARNING: The pork-bone stew for two really is huge!"}
{"text":"This is Toronto's best kept secret for Korean food. The portions are huge, the price is cheap, the banchan is yummy (especially the potatoes -- I don't know why but it has this nice sweetest and softness to it), and the flavor for all dishes is all there. It's not the prettiest looking restaurant, but that's how you know the quality is all there.

My go-to is the tofu stew with dumplings. It gets to a pretty spicy level which I find a tad bit more than other Korean restaurants but I don't mind. You gotta love spicy food if you wanna enjoy Korean food! Occasionally, I get the seafood pancake which is oh so yummy with their dipping sauce. Oh, and I always end up packing extra food home because the portions are ridiculous! 

I've tried many dishes here and nothing has ever disappointed. The only con I'd say would be that they're cash only but I'm always prepared with cash as I make my trip here!"}
{"text":"After living in Seaton Village/Koreatown South for a couple years, this is still my favourite Korean restaurant in the area. Super cheap, huge portions, and extremely tasty homemade food. A good sign, this place is consistently one the busiest restaurants along Bloor, but it's worth the wait. You can't go wrong with the classic staples, like bibimbap and dumplings, but a bit more exploration of the menu will yield many other tasty finds: Korean short ribs, sweet/spicy chicken and vegetables on a sizzling hot plate, beef tossed with rice and kimchi and crowed with a perfectly fried egg (complete with runny yolk), and the fried-to-perfection potato and vegetable pancake. The portions are huge, and if you aren't a big eater, expect to take some leftovers home. The wife and I always order an extra dish for take out so we are guaranteed a few more meals in the upcoming days. Also consistently better than other places in the area I've tried are the appetizers (banchan). They are some of the tastiest and you can ask for refills without hesitation. Considering how large the portions are, the prices are very reasonable, and bottles of beer are also very cheap as well ($4 domestic, $5 import). The only consideration to mention is that they are cash only and there is no ATM on the premises."}
{"text":"Eh service. We ordered the following items:
- spicy squid with rice
- seafood kimchi pancake
- beef noodle soup

Everything was pretty average. Nothing to write home about. The beef soup broth was the only thing that stood out a bit as it had a concentrated beef flavor."}
{"text":"Heart of K town is this little hole in the wall restaurant. It's not pretty inside and the washrooms are as small as Air Canada's flights. But the food is excellent, large portions and 6 banchan served with all meals and refillable for free. I just hope they expand or open up another location. This place gets very hectic easily daily. Don't be caught standing in line waiting. Come early at 11 am for lunch or 5 pm for dinner."}
{"text":"*CASH ONLY* 
Good quality food, lots of side dishes, cheap prices (menu includes tax already and the portions are huge). 

#34 Bulgogi and squid with steamed rice: 
Found mild spicy to be quite spicy. Huge portion, glad they gave lots of rice to go with the sauce. Beef and squid were tender. 

#3 Seafood pancake:
Lots of ingredients and I appreciate how it wasn't mostly just batter. Very flavourful. Unfortunately only some of the edges was crispy so we took it home to make it crispier. 

Service was great. Everyone seems to need take-out boxes afterwards just because there is so much food. We came on a weekday around 12PM and the place was quite empty. Other reviews complain there's no A/C, but we were quite comfy with the central ceiling fan...not sure how hot the place would get if the restaurant was packed though."}
{"text":"I have lived in Korea Town for just over 8 months now so I thought It was about time to try some food from the area. My boyfriend LOVES Korean food and absolutely loves this place so I knew I had to try it. 

 Over all I really enjoyed it! You get a good ( even huge) amount of food for the price. Endless sides with really tasty veggie or meat options. We got the vegetable fried dumplings and the sweet and spicy beef bulgogi ( which is my new favourite food ever! well..other than tacos.. ). It was just the right amount of spice with a sweet tangy sauce. 

You can tell this place is popular and well loved as there is ALWAYS a line. So if you're hungry show up earlier as they only have a handful of tables. Also it's cash only, so no plastic friends! 

I really want to try the bimibap next time we go! Anything with an egg on top is A+ in my book."}
{"text":"Depending on what you get some of the food is good and others not so much. 

Bibimbap - mediocre, a little bland in my opinion 
Short ribs - good but not the best I've had
Dukbboki - sweet and spicy, I really enjoyed it even if they used instant noodles in the dish. I recommend it. 

Service is so/so bordering rude. It is slow because it is packed. But I asked for a soup take away container for my dukbokki and the waitress rejected me twice because dukbokki isn't soup she says. But it literally has watery sauce and it would've leaked and the small ass square container she gave me was way too small. So I literally offered to pay for it and she shit talks me in front of me in Korean, which I understand. Just cause I don't look like I would she thought it'd be ok. I mean if her tone was rude too, the scoffing, yeah if that was not obvious enough. All in all not good customer service."}
{"text":"It's an affordable joint with most dishes under $10 and specialty items closer to $15. The food is on the greasy side but I would probably not re-order items like the potato pancake or dumplings. 

They have the staple appetizers on the house like seaweed, potatoes, and kimchi which are tasty, however they arrived almost at the same time as the main dishes. I saw this happen to a few other tables as well. 

Service was friendly and they didn't have to be asked twice to bring more water."}
{"text":"My go to restaurant for when I'm home sick. Growing up in Vancouver I wasn't really sure where to find good Korean food downtown, and living in the Annex it was an easy stroll down to Bloor and Christie. Tried almost every restaurant on that block, and this is by far the best Korean food I've had and reminds me a lot of home cooking. The menu offers a wide variety of different basic Korean dishes from pork bone soup to bibimbap, as well as dumplings and other Korean soups. 

Highly recommend for anyone who loves Korean food and the side dishes are amazing! 

Very affordable just remember this place takes cash only!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here and thought it was a cute little hole in the wall with a lineup outside to indicate some measure of quality. The menu looked good, but the tables were still kind of dirty from the people before us.

My friend got the beef bulgogi and I ordered the pork bone soup. We didn't get our side dishes until they had served side dishes to five people that came in after us. I was wondering if we would even get them.

For service, there is a bell behind your table that you ring when you need something. This is rather impersonal, but convenient. We rang for some beer and she took the order, walked right past the beer fridge (which was right behind our table) and went to get five other things before she brought the beer. WTF? We could have served ourselves! when she finally brought the beer, she threw them on the table with the opener beside it, indicating that we had to open our own. 

Do I just not get Korean service? They are always really friendly at Buk Chang Dong Soon, but both this place and tofu village have given me the impression that I've somehow done something to offend them just by being there.

The Soup was ok. I've had better. The side dishes were good-- in particular the spicy cucumber and the yam noodles.

I wouldn't come back here. The food is decent and cheap, but I'd rather pay more and  be treated with some margin of respect. I don't need someone to lick my boots, but I enjoy it when people at least ACT like they're not going to spit in my food. I tipped well, regardless. Hey-- Karma, right?"}
{"text":"Went to Koreatown with a few friends and found this place which caught our eyes with a several people waiting outside. (If that doesn't scream delicious! I don't know what else does).

I got the naeng myun which I was craving. My friends ordered the dol sot bibimbap which was good! The prices are really affordable and good for the proportions they give you.  And the Banchan tasted really homie.  Definitely coming here again to try different items on the menu!!"}
{"text":"I was expecting an employee to be yelled at during my dinning experience the other night but thankfully that didn't happened. 

Walked in and was greeted right away but all the tables were occupied. Waited only 5 minutes for our table. Tea and menus were given right away. Lots to chose from the menu but i settled for seafood kimchi beef bulgogi. There was six side dishes and tasted okay. The bulgogi tasted okay it was good. i don't know maybe cause I'm chinese and i love my food with MSG..but i didn't taste much or any  MSG in it  my dish which was okay. 
Waitress was very attentive asked us for refills on the  side dishes.  
I would come back if I'm feeling on the light side and eating MSG free food."}
{"text":"efficient service, LIPSMACKING side dishes and subtle main dish (vegetarian noodle soup). Definitely recommend anyone to try out this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Love this place! My friends and I go here a lot and it has the best food! Best dumplings and really delicious soup for takeout! The only thing that bugs me is the lineup and the clutched space. Yeah, definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"They only take cash!!

Oddly, the spicy fried rice cake had 2 peppers and the spicy beef and vegetable stew had only 1 pepper but the stew felt 4x spicier?? Anyways the stew was tasty and is a great way to get you warm in the winter, but it felt like the skimped out on beef in place of vegetables (although the rice dishes give you lots). Spicy rice cakes were delicious and I enjoyed it more.

Great place to go if you don't want to wait long at other popular places in koreatown. Only had to wait like 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Waitress didnt care to help us much looked at me blankly when i asked for a Hite beer (koreas national beer)

Apps were soggy, normally i crush all those delicious side dishes mmm kimchi but not this time

bibimbap was weak

soft tofu stew with seafood was ok but the seafood tasted frozen.

took forever to get our bill 

not going back"}
{"text":"this place is really good and very consistent, never dealt with a male server here though before. the price makes this place even more attractive and every dish is made fresh. unlimited refills on the apps and rice and tea without charge. always a line-up too for some reason -1 for the flies"}
{"text":"Delicious food, fast service and excellent prices. The side dishes are super yummy :-)"}
{"text":"Came for a late lunch with a group of 4. We went in around 2 PM on a saturday and there was still a small line at the door. It's a small restaurant, with seating for about 20, and given how popular this restaurant is based on other reviews, getting a seat may be a challenge unless you're coming at an off time. I guess later than 2 PM.

A big sign in the back reads \"CASH ONLY\", but there's an ATM next door if you usually prefer cards.

They have bright green walls with all sorts of what appears to be random artwork and decorations of all sorts spread out along the walls throughout the restaurant. Washrooms are very small, and there's a simple sliding door that separates you from the hallway. It's not very clean, and if you're claustrophobic you might consider passing on it.

On the menu, they have a good selection of items to choose from (80 items), whether you're looking for some fried rice, stew, bibimbamp, or some snacks like dumplings or pancakes. They also have a couple larger hot pots. The prices are pretty cheap as well, with most large meal items coming in at under $10.

They serve up 6 different side-dishes, and offer refills.

I tried the pork bone soup and fried rice with chicken in a stone bowl. Both dishes were quite spicy, and not the sweet kind of spice. If you can't handle spice, you might need to ask for more tea or water. I do enjoy spice, and would say it makes the dishes that much better.

I can see why people would line up to get a meal here at 2 PM. Would recommend it if you're in koreatown."}
{"text":"The place is great but I have to come with someone else cuz I have no clue what I'm eating! Haha! Great prices for the quantity that you're getting. Only one lady working the whole place so service is slow in some ways. I haven't been here in years but I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Got the kimchi fried rice with beef again but this time to go. I've never had a korean restaurant give me this much of a generous portion to go with ample side dishes. Many korean restaurants give me smaller than in house portions and cut edges on the side dishes but not Sunrise! I have enough food to do a mukbang... one where my nose runs because the fried rice is actually spicy! Highly recommend take out and dine in!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking forward to some kimbap but the place was closed, so we decided to be a little adventurous. We came across this restaurant, which was filled and attracted us to the place. I ordered the kimchi chi gae and bulgogi dinner (I was super hungry) and the wife had the duck bokgi. Everything was delicious and the portions were bigger than we expected for the price. The service was spot on for us and will come back again to try out few of the other dishes.

I recommend this place if you don't want something fancy but something homey and filling.. and want korean food."}
{"text":"3.5 stars for Sunrise House, and a hat tip to my super lovely friend Laura for bringing us here! (Hi Laura!)

I had reached a Korean food plateau because I didn't know which places to try. I would definitely return to Sunrise House just for the side dishes. The seaweed and glass noodles were my favourite, but those potatoes were my extra favourite.

My boo and I ordered shrimp bibimbap and spicy rice cakes with veggies (I asked for \"mild\" as opposed to the two threatening chili peppers next to this dish on the menu, which presumably means \"not mild\"). Our friends ordered soon tofu, dumplings, rice cakes with beef, and another bibimbap. Between those and the banchan, everyone was happy and nobody had elbow room. There were 2 kinds of chewy rice cakes and they were both so great that even our pickiest pal was pleased. (Hi Jono!)

One complaint: NO EGG IN THE BIBIMBAP?!?!!?!?"}
{"text":"I had a friend who used to work here. She recommended this place. I'm glad she did. 
With so many choices in Koreatown, I'd say Sunrise House is definitely near the top of the list (Buk Chang Dong is my top choice) for Korean food in the area. 

Sunrise House doesn't specialize in anything but they have all your fan favourites and more. You can't go wrong with anything on their menu, especially at these dirt cheap prices. Most dishes are under $10. Food quality is good too! 

This place is pretty small and they understandably try to fit as many tables in as possible. Since it's packed every time I go (a good sign), if you bring a big party, it might be a problem. Fortunately for me, dining out usually only requires a table for 2 so we got seats quickly. It is a little cramped but I can overlook that easily as I generally focus on the food only. Service isn't the most prompt, especially since the restaurant is usually busy. The atmosphere is the typical mom and pop style Korean restaurant which I like. I'm not a fan of pretentious restaurants."}
{"text":"Best Korean restaurant on the block. Every dish is spot on. Quick service to get you in and out, and value is hard to match anywhere else. Usually a line everyday of the week."}
{"text":"Holy crap. I could fly to Toronto right now just to go to this restaurant.

An absolute must whenever I'm in town and craving some down-to-earth Korean goodness. Tiny, hole in the wall, dirt cheap, and absolutely delicious. 

Some must haves: the seafood pancakes, the spicy soups, and the short ribs. Just pure yum."}
{"text":"Went to this place a few months ago. Very bad experience. Old rice. Frozen PC dumplings, they pulled out the bag right in front of my face. Oh might I mention that the men in this place seem to make their female workers cry??? Exactly never will return."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb. Fantastic portions and free sides with all orders! The place can get really busy at times...and is usually understaffed, you can really see the waitress breaking a sweat, I commend her. It would be better for the establishment if they hired someone else during peak hours though. 

PS. this place only accepts cash, so come prepared."}
{"text":"Food was good and I enjoyed the side dishes. Didn't really have to wait even though the place is pretty tiny.

We ordered:
Seafood pancake: crispy and had lots of seafood in it. Loved the sauce that came with it. 4.5/5

Omurice: huge portion and was pretty standard. 3/5

Bibimbap: HUGE portion, was piping hot and the rice crisped up very nicely. Probably the best bibimbap I've had! 5/5

This place is worth a visit if you like Korean food, they have a lot of options for a great price. The service is average for a Korean restaurant but don't expect much from the decor."}
{"text":"I love this place. I have been going weekly for over 2 years now. I also introduced that place to so many of my friends and they all love it!

Food is good, quantity is generous and the price is tiny! What else can you ask for!
The service is always good and courteous. The waitress might be slower at times but you can't blame her when she takes care of all the tables by herself. 

I am a fan of their Spicy Bulgogi, so many flavours! I love their pancakes also!
Their side dishes including the kimchi is really good!

Cons: you might have to wait a bit when you get there because the place is tiny but really it's all worth it. We would never think of going somewhere else with my friends however hungry we are!

Things to know: it's cash only and they serve beer also!"}
{"text":"Came to Sunrise religiously back when I lived on Bloor. This place serves up a huge variety of cheap korean food that is bound to hit the spot.

This time, we ordered the Kimchi Seafood pancake, the Bibim Naeng Myun (cold noodle with chilli paste), and Soft Tofu Stew. The pancake is always a hit for us and we almost always order it. Unfortunately, I was not super impressed with the tofu stew I ordered. Although there were tons of tofu and a handful of dumplings, I felt that the flavour and ingredients ratio was off. I am a soup person, but I was struggling to get anything but tofu in each spoonful. Despite this, I still have a soft spot for Sunrise as everything else I've tried was top notch comfort food. I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Just a few bites from our full review..

\"The restaurant is bright green outside and inside which was a surprisingly non-appetizing choice of colour. It felt more like a variety store.\"

\"Our steamed Chicken Dumplings were not too impressive. We should have probably ordered beef or even pork variety to get more taste of these steamed pockets. The chicken meat made the dish dry and unenthusiastic.\""}
{"text":"I always wanted to try this place out because it looked so dingy and authentic. Now I get why there's always a lineup outside at dinner time. It's not a spacious restaurant but the food is great. I ordered the hot stone bowl bibimbap and of course there'd be kim chi so I couldn't finish my meal. Well priced, good quality and serving size. Go for lunch on a weekday if you can."}
{"text":"In actuality 4.5/5 since they only take cash, but for the price, quality, and quantity - I'll give a 5/5. 

But something minor that you can overlook considering they had PLENTY of diverse banchan and the portions were ridiculously huge (but tasty)! I got the spicy bulgogi and I had enough rice and meat leftover for two to take home for lunch the next day. The pork bone soup was also piled ridiculously high with meat and bean sprouts and totally worth the price. 

It's pretty cheap in comparison to other restaurants with items ranging between $8.99 - $13.99 (approx). 10/10 would come back again if I'm craving Korean and I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"This is my go to Korean restaurant when I feel like eating alone and pigging out.  I come all the way here because they are one of the few places that offer unlimited complimentary ban chans (the side dishes) and a great variety of them (about 6-7) no matter if you're here with a group or by your lonesome.

Best made items are the cold noodle, soondobu, rice cake soup and fried dumplings.  The perfect no frill meal.  Great value as well for the portion sizes Vs the price.  

Service is outstanding.  I am asked when I want a refill of anything and if I am enjoying my food etc.  

In the winters they are sure to heat up the restaurant well for a thoroughly enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"Why is almost every Korean place I've been too soo good?  My theory is that  they are all small family restaurants and home cooking is good no matter the cuisine.  This place definitely had that feeling. (or maybe it is that I have a pro guide who knows her Korean food taking me to all the best spots ;)  )

We were greeted with a smile and brought tea almost immediately. I ordered the Pork Bone Soup, and my friend ordered the Kimchi Stew.  Within a couple of minutes we had a nice array of those delicious Korean appetizers.  That spicy pickled cabbage stuff was particularly awesome.

About 10 minutes later our dishes arrive, piping hot.  The Pork Bone soup was topped with a mountain of sprouts and cabbage which covered the fall off the bone pork pieces.  The Kimchi looked very thick and hearty.

So much food, served so quickly for under 20$ for 2 people, this is a \"go to\" place if you are in the area."}
{"text":"love it? chicken hotpot?
This place is recommended by many of my Korean friends ! It must be authentic. ^^"}
{"text":"I've eaten at my fair share of Korean restaurants in the city and this is definitely my go to place. It's crowded, noisy, and you usually have to wait, but the food is worth the hassle. Don't come expecting timely service. However, the servers are much nicer than the typical arrogant waiters you find on the Ossignton stretch. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I felt like I'd just committed a robbery as I walked away after eating at this place. I paid eight dollars and there was no possible way I could finish all the food that was put in front of me. The value here is disgusting. I got the dolsot bibimbap and it was pretty standard, rice, veggies, beef and an egg in a sizzling stone pot. It wasn't the best bibimbap I've ever eaten but it was still really good. The egg was cooked perfectly which scores bonus points as I'm sick of over-cooked eggs in this city. The highlight for me was the side dishes. I was given six plus soup. The side dishes are pretty much a meal to themselves. The kimchi and sprouts were good but pretty much the same as everywhere else. The standouts were the seawood which had a wonderful tang, the potatoes which were deliciously savory/sweet, and the glass noodles which I couldn't really figure out the flavour of but I couldn't stop shoveling into my face. As for the service, you don't really need to see a server other than to place your order as it's got the Korean service style. Sticks and spoons are on the table, condiments on the table, pitcher of water gets plopped down for do-it yourself refills, and if you really need to see a server for some reason hit the button but the place is so small I found eye contact to be equally efficient. My server was serving like a monster running back and forth taking orders and dropping plates all by herself. I was impressed. Already planning my next trip."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The food is very good and it's one of the cheapest korean restaurant i've ever been too. I recommend this place! Btw, they only accept cash."}
{"text":"The place was laid out nice and cosy. Casual.  Nice big tables.  
Service was ok.  But you do have to ask if you need things like water, extra side dishes etc.. They don't just offer you this.  
The meals were ok.  You can taste the heat but perhaps not much on flavour.  Our one friend found that her bibimbap was great.  
Price was pretty comparable to the other locations in Ktown.
Only 2 bathrooms, one for men and one for the ladies.  The men's bathroom was out of paper towels.  
Cheap eats."}
{"text":"The one thing I get from this restaurant is the kimchi bokkumbap and its usually take out as the location is rather small and cramped. It is oily, spicy and packed full of sodium BUT damn is it delicious. It's one of my favourite guilty pleasures.

Caution: I do not know if it's my stomach reacting to the oils or amount of spice in the food but I usually have a bit of a stomach ache after eating the kimchi bokkumbap. 

You can park your car on the side streets and there are plenty of green p's nearby. Alternatively, you can park in PAT central."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here with our 2 year-old son on Christmas Eve.  The food was really good and came out very quickly (which is always appreciated with a toddler).  We ordered the bibimbap in the stone bowl, the soft tofu stew with beef and vegetables, and the fried chicken dumplings.  The food was delicious and the portions were large (and super cheap!).  We really enjoyed our meal and everything was delicious.  The only thing that was a little odd (but not the end of the world) was that you couldn't order a plate of jap chae, but it was one of the side dishes.  So they would refill it when you ran out.  Also, for all the parents out there - this place does have high chairs.  This is definitely what I would call a \"hole in the wall\" place - the atmosphere isn't in any way fancy, but the food is outstanding."}
{"text":"Great food - service was good and the server spoke english pretty well.  Sometimes it can be pretty hard to get your order across if you don't speak korean in some places on this strip."}
{"text":"Authentic, delicious Korean dishes prepared and served by real Koreans. Their food tasted the same as Korea Garden in Makati City, Philippines.

But the difference is the price we paid. It is less expensive at this family-owned Sunrise House. Huge portions and NO aftertaste of MSG!"}
{"text":"The food was great and the price and service were okay. I would just think the place was too small and had no air condition during the very hot summer"}
{"text":"Reasonable price and everything is in a large portion. They also have a variety of different side dishes, but you will have to wait for a while if you go there during busy hours"}
{"text":"We visited sunrise house as a group of four on a Sunday night for dinner. There was a good line up for tables, which is always a good sign!

For the four of us, we ordered a large portion of pork bone soup and a large portion of spicy chicken. I wasn't a great fan of the pork bone soup, it lacked flavour in my opinion and the pork wasn't fall off the bone yet (as it normally is in other restaurants). The spicy chicken on the other hand, was much more flavourful, with a hint of sweetness and quite spicy. 

The four o us really enjoyed the side dishes that were complementary, especially the seaweed on as it cut through the spiciness really nicely. The meal came up to $15 each after taxes and tips (we also ordered a bottle of korean rice wine) and we all left very full."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. Food tastes great, portions are beyond generous and cost is cheap! 

Tips:
1. CASH ONLY
2. Portions are huge and you will likely have leftovers. Not a little bit, literally another meal. Keep this in mind when ordering. 
3. Their spicy bulgogi ( ) on hot plate is amazing!! Lots of meat, not full of veggie fillers like other Korean restaurants 
4. The pork bone soup () is subpar. Can't compare to owl of Minerva's. Instead, try something else! Everything else is delicious
5. The kimchi chigae () is suuuuuuper spicy. I LOVE spice. But this literally burns my digestive tracts. It might be your thing though, if you can really handle spic"}
{"text":"Had 3 mains and an order of shrimp dumplings. Enough to feed the four of us and save half for the next day! Food was delicious but we somehow ended up stomach aches afterwards (worth it, maybe????). Dishes were all super tasty and the banchan too.

I added photos. Dishes are huge! Paid about 45 dollars. Cheapest meal we had in ages. 

First come first serve. If you arrive in pairs, you may have to share your table with other people. Bigger groups may have to wait longer. There's no outside queue, you wait in the restaurant. Which is kind of awkward, but you get to see what everyone else is ordering which I think is fun."}
{"text":"The pork bone soup is huge+yummy! I couldn't finish it and packed the left over for another meal! Definitely will go back again."}
{"text":"It's really crowded and busy. The food is not that amazing as others mentioned. Only one waitress there, we waited for a long time for order and payment."}
{"text":"I am an ardent korean food fan and in my quest I discovered this little place, have been following the reviews for a while now. On a windy saturday I picked to dine here for a late lunch. 
Its is lined amongst a lot of other korean restaurants, a small place inside out. There was no waiting at that point but they were busy and all tables were filled, I took the table right at the door which had just been cleaned.
I picked the kimchi stew with sausage and chicken and while I waited, the crowd started building and as there is no real waiting space they kinda hover over you. Also if u r at the door the breeze is going to get you so keep ur jacket. 
All dishes are served with six sides including a portion if rice. The stew came sizzling hot and a lot of it. For a cold day that was what the doctor ordered, hot & hot. It was flavful lots of noodles, chicken, sausage and the beautiful flavor of kimchi. Highly recommended if you are a fan of mildly spicy food. 
As I eat as a party of one, I order just one dish which means I am going to be back soon to try more. They are a cash only place so do keep the tab on you. Its not expensive, for the portion size and how filling it is. If ambience and flashy menus dont bother you then for the food this is a great place."}
{"text":"I went to this location with three other friends.  Meal was cheap, we ordered three dishes it was $33+tip.

Pork bone soup, it wasn't cooked long enough it tasted like it was boiled for a short period.  It wasn't tender fall off the bone.  The soup, it just did not have much flavour.  It tasted watered down with a dash of chilly in the water.  Pork bone served with 4 bones for $8.99.  It is the cheapest one I've been to, but not great for taste.

Other dishes were okay.

Hot tea was complimentary.  Free WiFi.

I would try this place again with another dish because service was fast."}
{"text":"Sunrise House is always my go-to restaurant when I'm craving some korean food. I personally recommend the dolsot (beef) bibimbap because it's always very filling. Don't let the $9 price scare you, it's packed full with veggies, meat, rice and a fried egg on top. The meal also comes with (unlimited?) sides like kimchi, glass noodles, potatoes etc. The potatoes and kimchi are my favourite and I usually end up asking for more.

My only complaint about this restaurant is the size. It's pretty small for an eat-in restaurant and often can't accommodate for a large amounts of guests. There's only a few tables available and I believe the biggest table the have only holds about 5 people. There have been times when we've had to eat elsewhere because it was full and there was no room for us to wait."}
{"text":"I love this place too.  It was really tasty.  I'm loving all the little restaurants in Korea Town.  I ordered a dish of something that was sweet and spicy.  My DC was less happy with her meal ~ but only because she's not a huge kimchi fan and ordered kimchi fried rice...so ya (probably not the best testament one way or another).  I love Korean food and the made at home feel...seriously tastes as good as my bestie's mom's cooking!  Yum!  I will definitely be back here."}
{"text":"By far the best korean restaurant in the city!
I've tried different korean restaurants around the area or up north, nothing compares to this one.
It's delicious and cheap! You basically will always ended up taking half or your food home cause the portion is huge. Their side dishes are amazing too and free refill. The downside is the place is too small, so during lunch or dinner there will always be a line up. Overall this will always be my favourite korean restaurant."}
{"text":"Got the tofu stew with kimchi and pork. cheap and filling, but cant customize spiciness. Felt like a quarter of it was spicy oil. I also dislike that I cant crack the egg into the soup myself. It is a small place with only one waiter, but there is a button by the wall to press to get their attention."}
{"text":"Tasted and big portion. The pork bone stew for 2 people is definitely a lot for 2 ladies. We were too full after the lunch and chose to walk all the way to eaton center other than taking the subway.."}
{"text":"Very authentic Korean food!! Because you could find the owners, staff and even most customers are all Korean. I visited alone for bibimbap at a cold day. The food really warmed me. It was a little spicy and sweet, lots of vegetables and various kinds of delicious side dishes. Most importantly, the price was very reasonable. The restaurant was busy at mealtime, I waited for twenty mins to be seated when I took my friends there second time. Recommend the cold noodle for summer time and soup (or hot pot stew if you come with many friends) for winter time."}
{"text":"I came to Sunrise House for lunch today (no wait) and had such a good meal. While its decor is not the best, it makes up for it in its food and service. The owner (I think) is incredibly friendly and attentive. This restaurant has a very homey feel to it, and the food tastes fresh and hearty. Also the portions are huge! None of us could finish our meals. The side dishes are amazingggggggg! Love love loved the potatoes and seaweed."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's cute, small, cozy and awesome. The waitresses are super polite and the food here is great! The decor is average just like any other Korean restaurant.

I always order the soft tofu stew and it really hits the spot. The side dishes are always superb and tasty too. This place has easily became one of my favourite spots to go for cheap and yummy Korean food!

I'm still venturing around the streets of k-town to try other restaurants but this place is definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"So I go in to get take out.  Mind you I'm about 8 months pregnant.  Anyway, I ask if I can sit and wait, the man waiter says yes.  Take out hear takes about 5 to 10 min.  I'm sitting there for 2 min when this newer waitress who usually has a ponytail looks about 23 and has lots of earrings who I've had issues with before Bc I had asked for a container with a lid (which I've got many times before with no issues) says no it's for soup only.   Comes up to me and ask me to move bc she has customers.  I'm in no position to stand outside and wait for my food Bc it's much to painful at this point.   I let her know the man said I could sit. She walks away mad.  I think what the hell, it won't be long for my food to be done. I'm sure anyone with half a brain or even the ppl at the door waiting to sit would be considerate enough to let me sit those couple of mins more.  So when my food is done I'm fully intending to give the nice man a tip for take out.  As I'm paying I say to the man that he said could sit and that girl always gives me a hard time.  He says oh it's bc we have customers waiting and ppl eating in take priority over take out. I say you know I've been coming here since you've  opened and often (I've also introduced it to many now regulars)  he just shrugs his shoulders and says the place is small.  I say you know I was fully intending to tip the good service and he says for take out they don't get tips. Working is the service industry before I know that servers look for ways to get tips on take out.  So here I'm thinking what terrible service bc I'm probably going to tip them as much as the ppl sitting down and they will have to wait on then for at least 45 min.  I was so mad and disappointed I'm not sure I'm going to support them anymore even though food is really good and cheap."}
{"text":"Good price and big portions...what more can you ask for. It's also open late but cash only. Highly recommend if you're craving Korean food!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty much the definition of a hole in the wall restaurant. It's so cramped with the most questionable decor, but the food is AMAZING. I have been coming here for the past year and it's been consistently great every time. I will admit my taste in Korean food isn't entirely refined, but I can speak for the average person and tell you this place serves delicious food.

The bibimbap in the hot stone bowl (59) cooks my veggies and slightly fried rice to perfection. I do wish they'd add more bulgogi (a marinated meat) but the amount they serve is enough for the veggie filled dish. It's not a very salty dish as only a few elements add the salt aspect.

I will order the pork bone stew (47) even on a boiling day. This place doesn't have AC, and it's a hot spicy dish. This pork is fall off your fork tender, with some veggies for crunch. I have asked for them to reduce the spiciness once and noticed no change, but I'm okay with that. If you've never had pork bone stew before, it's a must try.

My go to side dish is the spicy rice cake (14). It's slightly sweet and perfectly chewy so I can't resist ordering it when I'm here.

This place can be packed and you may need to stand in line before you can get a seat. Not a good place for large groups due to this reason, but if you're willing to wait it should be okay (they have a couple large tables).
There's paid parking across the street.
The staff are often incredibly busy, so if you really need something just politely walk up to the register and wait for them to be less busy to tend to you (I sometimes have to ask for water as they don't always think to serve it). In any case, its best to be patient here. The food is so worth it!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and marvelous plates of side dishes help make Sunrise house your go-to place for delicious Korean fare on this crowded strip."}
{"text":"Went to this place with two friends. Ordered spicy bulgogi with sqid and asked for extra spicy. Guess I should not have done that as they put a lot of sauce but sauce is more sweet than spicy. Good portion. Side dishes were good. Staff friendly."}
{"text":"I feel conflicted about reviewing this place. This was our dining spot on our very first night in Toronto, but it didn't go smoothly for several reasons. I'll start with the positives:

++
Side dishes: above average, and the silent floor staff asked if we needed a refill, which didn't happen at another K place

This small space of no more than a dozen tables was full when we got here, and we were asked (or ordered) to move to a two-person table before we got our food. I appreciate the busy vibe, but not \"\"how\"\" we were rushed to move without explanation or reasons. We just figured it out ourselves when they say a group of three new customers where we'd sat

Salty food: miso soup was borderline inedible, but the saltiness of bulgogi prompted me to rinse out in the miso soup the entire meal. Enough said

Needless to say, we would not rush to go back."}
{"text":"This is my Korean restaurant to go to. I have tried pork bone soup from different restaurant in ktown and Sunrise has definitely the best one in my opinion as well as the best side dishes. Only down side is that the place small which it fills up quickly."}
{"text":"I'm just loving getting acquainted with the Korean food along this strip. There are already tons of cheap sushi eats between Spadina and Bathurst I didn't think it could get any better. 

So, one extraordinarily sticky night we decided to dash into Sunrise house to escape the coming torrential downpour. We entered and the place was surprisingly quite busy and had a steady flow of customers during our time there. This place has the most intense lime green walls you could choose...it makes competing restaurants GREEN with envy, one could say...on second thought probably not.

Anyways, despite their interior design choices this place is has awesome food. So hearty and delicious. They gave us 7 different banchan's and refilled them continuously through the meal. Service was quick, friendly and attentive and they provided us with our own pitcher of water for refills. Most notably though I think I was shocked by the price of the bill. It was something like $32 after tax+tip for 3 of us, and we were all stuffed.

I enjoyed the seafood pancake as it was packed with assorted seafood and veggies and tasty as usual. The fried dumplings were good too (but we asked for shrimp and received minced beef?) they were less thick than gyoza which was nice and you get 10pc for $6.

The cold dolsot beef was simple, healthy and filled with all the good stuff. Next time, however, instead of the thinly sliced beef bulgogi (some of which had cartliage and bits of fat) I would order the Marinated Beef short ribs or get a HUGE hot pot bowl to share. 

So excited to go back :)"}
{"text":"Something is definitely going on at this place. We will never go back. Food is way too salty that my BF and I had to finish the jug of water. And there is only one person working when it's peak time. Everything is too salty and tasteless. Meat is also very dry and not fresh. I remember this place was fairly good last time when I visited but I guess not anymore. Myself is Korean but my BF told me that by going to this place gives bad impression of Korea and he said it tastes like fake Korean food."}
{"text":"VENUE/AMBIANCE (3 stars)
Small, cramped restaurant located just across from Christie Station. There is street parking available for those driving. Seats approximately 20 diners. When we visited in the summer, the AC was barely turned on. We sweat through our shirts before we finished our meal. 

SERVICE (3 stars)
There's not a lot of service if you don't speak Korean, but all you really need to do is point at the food item on the menu and they'll get you what you need. Water is replenished when your bottle is empty but there's a constant supply (especially appreciated when you're eating spicy).

FOOD (4 stars)
My boyfriend and I almost always order the Spicy Kimchi Hot Pot Stew when we come here. The large hot pot easily feeds 2 people and you leave feeling like you'll never need to eat again. I love that they include fishcake and ramen. They include lots of different ingredients so each bite is a surprise. The soup is spicy and sour from the kimchi and kept hot by the portable butane burner. They also give you a wide variety of banchans (side dishes) which you can get refills for. 

QUALITY/VALUE (5)
At $17.99 for a hot pot stew, Sunrise House provides amazing value. For once a stew that feeds two actually costs less than ordering two regular meals! Most other restaurants would be charging $23+. 

OVERALL
4 stars - What the restaurant lacks in its physical appearance, they make up for with tasty, hearty meals and great value for your money!"}
{"text":"We went there because yummy korean was closed and we are lazy to walk further. The place was small and the food was good. Side dish have almost same taste (kimchi flavour). The price wasnt expensive and the portion perfect for us."}
{"text":"Sunrise House is one of those places you usually end up walking past.

An out-of-town friend and I ended up at Sunrise House through a recommendation. Normally I head to Ka-Chi but our friend raved about this place so I thought we'd give it a try. I was not disappointed. 

There was a woman cooking in the back and two waitresses. I hear this place is normally really packed but I think we beat the crowd. We ordered beef bulgogi and some spicy rice cakes. 

I've been by 4 times since May, 2016. I think that says a lot! Would definitely recommend :)"}
{"text":"First of all, you lose a star for being cash only. I don't really care what your reasons are, but it's an inconvenience to me (customer) and so it wasn't a 5-star experience.

Secondly, you lose a star for bad service. No one came to refill our water or side dishes.  In fact, it felt like they had forgotten about us.

Third, you lose a star for the cleanliness of your restaurant. If I hadn't looked at my chair before sitting, I would have sat in a puddle of soup. Then, after looking around, the chair from the table next to us was also wet with some spillage. On top of that, the floor was sticky from likely days worth of spillage.

That leaves you with 2 stars left. The food was worthy of 2 stars. So, 2 stars you will get."}
{"text":"By far the best pork bone soup! The portions are so generous! They give you many pieces of pork bone and a mountain high of bean sprouts! Decent price and lineups are usually out the door so come early!"}
{"text":"- What I have tried:
   + Pan fried chicken dumpling: really good, they give you soy sauce to eat with. I found it a bit oily but no where as oily as fried Chinese dumplings that I have tried lol. 
   + Stir fried spicy rice cake: much better than tobokki I have tried at other korean restaurant, but it was way too spicy.
   + Bulgogi bibimbap: I like this but it has the same problem as other Korean restaurants, that they put way too much vegetable instead of meat in there bibimbap. I prefer Tofu Village which is closed there just for the generous portion of meat they offer. 
   + Spicy bulgogi and squid with rice: again, really spicy so you have to tell them to make it much less spicy for you. This dish is my go-to-dish whenever I come here.
   + Pork bone soup: generous amount of pork bones. The soup was well done and flavourful, really enjoyed it.
   + Their side dishes were very good and unique. I would say they have the best side dishes aside from Tofu village I have ever tried.
- Portion: Generous, you only need to order one dish to be completely full.
- Price: Ridiculously cheap compare to other Korean restaurant in K town, like $7 for a huge bowl of pork bone soup that I couldn't even finish it. 
- Place is small, if you go during lunch or dinner hours, you need to wait for about 15-30mins.
- Service was fast and good.
- Highly highly recommend this place if you want to try cheap and authentic Korean food."}
{"text":"My friends and I were looking for a cheap place to eat some bibimbap so we came across sunrise house and wow god bless we found this place b/c the food was sooooooooooo good! The place is tiny but the food was A1 

We all ordered dolsot bibimbap and it was just heaven, the rice crisped up really nicely in the bottom, there was a good amount of bulgogi,vegetables and you would think something this good would cost a lot of money but it only was $9 
oh also the side dishes were really yummy too 

The only thing that sucks about this place is that since its so tiny you might not get a seat always and would have to wait outside. But I guess that just proves how amazing the food is. 

I recommend this restaurant for anyone who is looking for a place with good food and cheap prices :DDDDDDDD"}
{"text":"Thank you whoever wrote that this was the best kept secret. Because that's exactly what brought me here and my husband and I were not disappointed!

Come early...we did, on a Friday night by 6pm as it's a smallish place. The line was down the block by the time we left at 7:30. At first it was a bit slow, because what are you gonna do, it's one person handling the orders and I can't imagine the kitchen is that large but OMG when it all came out hot and sizzling. It was drooooool worthy. 
My husband I both got our own bibimbap, his spicy chicken, mine spicy bulgogi pork. I also couldn't help myself and got the LA Korean spare ribs because everything is just so affordable. This ribs were to die for, although the hot stone pots were delicious too! 
Also the banchan was spot on. For once thank god there was no weird fish stuff. Just all vinegar based or kimchi based or fun crunchy things and sweet potato glass noodlystuff. Also surprisingly we each got a bowl of miso soup too. 
Seriously. This shouldn't be a best kept secret anymore. Sorry to say, but everyone needs to come here NOW!"}
{"text":"I've been to many Korean restaurants over the years and I can guarantee you it's the BEST restaurant in K-Town. It's the closest it'll get to my mom's cooking and this is the place I go by myself or with my non-Korean coworkers.
It's a small place run by 2 Korean ladies (probably sisters) and one waitress. I haven't experienced anything negative in my last 10 - 15 visits.
It's the BEST VALUE and BEST TASTING place for Korean food in K-Town.
Enjoy everyone!"}
{"text":"I was craving for korean food and wanted to try a new restaurant so I ended up at Sunrise House.  The staff here are very attentive.  The food is definitely very cheap.  I ordered extra spicy pork bone soup (for only $7!) with no beansprouts.  The pork bone was not very flavourful and the meat did not fall off easily.  The meat on the pork bone was thick and did not taste as \"fatty\" as other restaurants.  I really enjoyed the soup as it was \"sweet spicy\".  

They also give a lot of appetizers (6 dishes) compared to other restaurants."}
{"text":"Prime definition of hole in wall. This place would've been impossible for me to find if it wasn't for a friends recommendation. I found it about 2 years ago and its slowly climbs it way up to be my favorite Korean place not only in just Koreatown but in Toronto. If you're a fan of side dishes, every side dish feels finely tuned to compliment any dish. Service can be abit slow but the servers are young girls who put in long hours so its tough to blame"}
{"text":"i love this place!
The food is really good and really cheap, probably one of the best place to eat in koreantown. 

i've been there 3 times and i'm always how much you can get for cheap! there is a lot of choices which is good. I'm a fan of the pancakes and spicy rice cake!

The service is ok, i mean in some others place you can be more friendly with the staffs here it was only a customer relationship.  Of course if you are only here to eat it doesn't matter!

 i will definitely come back here soon!"}
{"text":"The yukgaejang was a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. It tasted overly of black pepper and spinach (both of which are not supposed to be in this dish!!!)....this feels like classic Korean food, so this was a huge bummer!!!!

The mul naengmyeon was good, with chewy noodles and the right soup. The mustard was not spicy though, so that was a little bit of a bummer!

The bulgogi dukbokki was good, but not the greatest thing ever, feels like cheap university eats or street food, but less awesome. 

It seems a lot of people come for the pork bone soup, so I might come back for that, but there is DEFINITELY better Korean food. Alternately, this place was SOOOO CHEAP! which explains the crowds of young-ins all the time!"}
{"text":"The Sunrise House is right in Koreantown and serves some of the best Korean food I have had since I dated a Korean girl. I had the spicy bulgogi with squid and rice and it was amazing. There were so much flavours in the food and it had a great spicy level. The only things I can say bad about this place is that there isn't a lot of sitting, so it gets busy quickly and that the service isn't that fast. Overall, even though you might need to wait, the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"***Just a heads up, there has been an overall price increase this year. Dumplings are now 7.99, only a few soups are 9.99, and everything else starts at 10.49+ 

Still my favourite place to come for the side dishes. Main dishes are always delicious."}
{"text":"This is a great little restaurant in Korea town. Very cozy in the winter time, and you get a lot of food for the price. The place seats about 35 people and was packed on a Tuesday night. They don't do reservations so we had to wait around 20 minutes to get a table for 6. We shared two large pots of stew (which comes with two bowls of rice each), an order of spicy rice cakes, and a plate of seafood pancakes. 

The kimichi stew had a variety of ingredients such as sausages, bacon, pork slices, rice cakes, instant noodles, fish cakes, and other veggies as well. It was spicier than the pork bone soup and thicker as well, probably from the starch in there. I personally enjoyed the soup base of the pork bone one more. The meat fell off the bone, and it was loaded up with plenty of bean sprouts and cabbage. The rice cakes were nice and chewy. The pancake was huge! It was a little on the starchy side and their dipping sauce was a bit too heavy on the soy sauce. The highlight for me were the side dishes. Their pickled radish and seaweed were on the sour and sweet side, which is the type I prefer. The glass noodles and beansprouts were not too greasy and the potatoes were cooked just right. 

The entire meal came out to be around $60 total, and we were beyond stuffed. We had most of our rice and more than half of the stew left. My only complaint is that the store is a bit run down and could use a renovation. The space is also a little crammed, and couples beside us were asked to share tables with other people. However, as long as they stay true to the food, I will still go back when I'm in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Been going to this place for years and last night just completely ruined our experience. WON'T BE going back due to VERY POOR customer service. Prior to sitting down we had to wait probably 15 min which I was happy to do as there was only one lady on staff.

But once our food came the waitress put the wrong dish on our table. My husband took one spoonful out of the dish and it was at that point we realized it wasn't the noodle dish that we ordered. We told her immediately, to which I mentioned 'would she like to take the dish back', she insisted 'no' because we had already digged in it. At most restaurants if it's their mistake of delivering the wrong dish to you- you are not charged for the dish regardless of if you've touched the dish or not. It's just general customer service! 

Then comes the bill and WE'RE CHARGED for the dish WE DID NOT ORDER. I ask her why were being charged to which she said 'Yes I made the mistake of putting this dish on your table, but you ate it did you not?' I try to ration with her, but she keeps walks away IGNORING me to the point that the whole restaurant is looking! We end up just paying for the dish, cause she wouldn't budge, and we had no other choice really. My friend even said to her 'would you rather us pay the $11 and loose a couple of long time customers?' to which she answers 'YES!' 

I have never sat down at a restaurant and had such poor service, have your way lady over one dish which was your mistake in the first place. You just lost a handful of customers..."}
{"text":"I love this place, I probably visit here at least once per week if not twice when I was in collage...reasonably priced compare with a lot other Korean restaurants down the street."}
{"text":"Growing up eating korean food in restaurants and at home my entire life I like to think I have a good understanding in what makes korean food delicious.  I find almost all korean restaurants the same mediocre food. That is until I came to sunrise, first off this is the only place in k town with a line no matter the time of day. Staff are friendly and food comes out pretty fast. Their ban chan (free side dishes) is literally the best ive ever had at a restaurant (one of the best kimchi,  Cucumber kimchi, jap Chae, kelp, tofu,) their meals are large portions and super flavourful, my go to items are the spicy squid/Bulgogi with kimchi, dolsot bibimbap, and their Bu Dae jigae which comes in either a size for 1 person or the large hot pot version."}
{"text":"A restaurant that you walk by and decides to go in because you're wondering why there's a line up to eat here. 

Food is very good. If you're looking for authentic Korea, this is the place. 

The downside of this place is that it isn't very clean. The washroom and the overall restaurant is pretty worn down. Service is okay but they had one waitress working on a Saturday. Often I find that we'd have to wave our arms in the air to get her attention for a little bottle of hot sauce."}
{"text":"Always crowded, small place, cash only, price is good. My favorite Korean restaurant in K-town. Just by watching those people eating and waiting from outside of their window, you can tell that this place must be good. I recommend: their spicy squid with rice, which is super, very tasty, and large proportion."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place years by now. Sometimes their attitudes suck, but the food is good and the food price is OK although they increased the pricing this year.
Today I noticed that two new girls were working, they seemed pleasant and welcoming so I was pretty happy about that. I ordered the spicy cold noodle to go and they told me to come back in 20-30 min, more than usual, but it was packed inside, I understood the extra wait so I killed time in the area.
25 min later I went back to this diner and got the food, I was happy until I came home and checked inside; they forgot to put the broth for the cold noodle (some place don't use it, but this place give you the broth). I phoned them immediately, explained what happened and they were apologetic in the beginning and then she started making excuses, but didn't give me any solution! Basically, they said next time they will give me a service. Their English isn't good so I guess they meant they were gonna give me a little extra for the next time, but wait a minute, what about the food that I wanted to eat tonight? How the hell do they remember me for the \"next time\"? At the point I knew they are trying to get away with the situation while saying whatever. I told them that I was gonna come back for the broth, but for the inconvenience, I wanted the money back. They said fine. I was actually surprised that they accepted giving me the money for the food and the broth as well. I asked them again, and the girl on the phone said \"Yes, I can do that\". 
My wonderful husband left our place to get my broth for me and then I got a phone call from this diner 45 min after I phoned them first. They were saying \"this is a food related complaint so we need to check the food, please bring the food back\". WTF!? I told them that my husband already left home and didn't bring the whole thing because they NEVER INSTRUCTED me so. They kept telling me now they wouldn't give me the money if I wanted to have the broth. And they told me that my husband was already there (when he came home he told me that he is the one who asked them to call me because three of them were claiming and arguing with him not to give him the money back). What a nightmare!! 
I just wanted the complete food that I ordered. They are the ones who screwed up the whole thing and promised me something that they would NOT do. So my husband was exhausted because the old lady there was telling him that they were never gonna give the money, and if he wanted the broth he had to pay for it!! At the same time, I had no idea what situation my husband was in, and still talking with the girl on the phone because she was giving me a lecture while saying \"next time bring the whole food back because we need to check what's wrong\". I said it would be pointless in my case because it's not like the food was half rotten or there was no meat for a BBQ meal, it was simply just there was no broth! How could I prove it was their fault and I'm not making up the story? When I talked with her for the fist time on the phone, she admitted that she packed the food and even said that she didn't know the broth came with this meal. So clearly it's her fault!
She kept saying \"it's our process, we need to check the food\". Then why didn't she tell me so in the first place? I know why because they made up \"the process\" just for this case. They weren't willing to give me the money anyways. On top of this crazy argument, she was never tried to listen to me, she was talking over me the whole time!!! What kind of service is that? Let the customer talk: that's a customer service 101, I work in a retail, too, I never ever treat my customers like that.
Finally I got so sick of listening to their nonsense with a lack of sincerity, I told them to just give him whatever and let him go, and then the girl said \"fine\" and hang up abruptly! I was speechless.
My husband came home and explained what happened, they refused to give him the money especially the old lady although they accepted the deal when I talked with the girl, and he ended up getting the broth and half of the price of what I paid.
I actually don't care much about the money. What bothers me the most is that they are so dishonest! 
1. Just don't promise something you can't do 
2. Don't tell the customer you will not accommodate after letting a customer make another trip back to your diner ( the customer may not live close, may have to pay for the transportation etc..)
3. If you have \"a process\" that you need to follow to deal with a complaint, instruct the customer right away not 45 min later or after the customer shows up
4. Do not talk while the customer is speaking

I have been pretty loyal to this place for 8 years but I don't think I'll go back again."}
{"text":"The food here is sooo good.  The panchan is fresh and a good variety (made fresh daily).  Adjuma is a wonderful woman who puts her heart and soul into her food.  Their cold noodles (nyengmyeon - bibim and mul) are delicious.  Dolsot pap is perfect - the dolsot is hot and the rice sizzles - the way it should be.  Her kimchi chigae is also very good - lots of gochu so make sure you ask if you'd like it mild or spicy.  This is not a fancy place but the food is consistent and consistently good.  SPOTLESS kitchen.  Their jongols look good - have seen people order them and the jongols smell divine.  Her kimchi is just the way I like it - vinegary and crunchy.  Yum.  What makes this also such a pleasant experience is the Adjuma really takes a pride in what she serves.  We have been regulars since they opened and I am happy to see that this place is always busy.  Thanks Adjumoni for providing such a pleasurable, enjoyable escape!  Tae dan hi kamsah hamnidah!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is so cute warm and cosy.
They make food exactly how your korean mama would make them (if you had one) 
Everything is so homely. I just wished the place was bigger so you wouldn't have to wait for so long."}
{"text":"I was there last night with a friend. Got there at 6:30 pm and we got lucky where we only waited for 10 mins to get a table for 2. I saw after we were seated that there was a line up out the door -- and it was cold outside! But that's how good this place is. 

I love and completely agree with what another reviewer said about this place, \"...you come
To Sunrise House for what it is, not what it's not!\" 

We got #33 stir fried quid with rice - delicious! Not rubbery this time (last time it was a little). Very generous portion of both squid and rice. 

I enjoyed the free side dishes. 

We also got #61 Hot stone pot Bibimbap with spicy chicken which was disappointing. Not much chicken and we had thought it would come with a fried egg like the others (but it doesn't, double checked the menu after). It was nothing special. 

Total including taxes came to $20.23 for two people. Plus we were both full and there was enough leftover for the 2 of us to have a small lunch for the next day! Unbelievable. 

We had to ask for a few things like our container was out of spoons, and for bowls for sharing, etc. but the waitress was always nice and she was the ONLY waitress. Someone from the kitchen brought the food out 

You also get complimentary green tea (or water if you ask for it). And a bag to take your take-away/leftovers home in:-) Such a great place. And such great value for your money. 

I did notice that my hair and coat (winter parka) smelled like slices  after being in there for 2 hrs....but the smell was gone from my coat by the next morning.  

In the past, about 2 yrs ago, I had the park bone soup based on someone's recommendation and I found it very bland. But it was a large portion but half of it was bone. The pictures on the wall do the food justice & are quite accurate/life like."}
{"text":"I have found my go to Korean restaurant for all my korean food cravings. I am not the only who shares this sentiment as you will normally find a line up for this place. Why? Delicious food & Big portions! 

Me, mom and sister had the pork stew. This order is supposed to feed 2 people but it was good for us 3. The meat in the stew is chunky, not just bone (and there was a lot!). While my fam munched on the regular white rice i decided to go with the kimchi chicken fried rice in a hot stone bowl. Again big portion and very yummy! The meat itseld (from the stew) may not have taste but it can incorporates itself as an extra component to the fried rice. Naturally  having the soup with the pork is a given but you also get a good medley of flavour when you mix the soup with the rice as well (likr a risotto texture). 

There are many more items on the list and I am excited to come back from time to time and try them all

Extra info: it is a small place and because it is popular it gets filled up fast. Staff is friendly and accomidating. Hope yiu Enjoy your meal!"}
{"text":"Small simple and old Korean restaurant, came in for lunch on a hot day, they did not have AC. We picked a table by the open door and order some rice wine. It came with some gold metal bowls to drink with, the rice wine  went down smoothly and cool us down. We were four people, and we ordered four dishes to share -- seafood pancake, pan fried chicken dumpling, pork bone soup, and cold buckwheat noodle in beef broth. The side dishes and our order were all delicious. And for the price we paid, it was a really great meal!"}
{"text":"I was taken here by two seasoned Koreatown foodies because they apparently serve the most side dishes on the strip. The colourful array of tiny plates is not only a mini feast for the belly, but also for the eyes.

There are also a lot of options on the menu. The bulgogi bibimbop that I finally decided upon arrived quickly in it's perfectly round metal bowl along with my friends' piping hot stone bowls. Cold beer was perfect for washing it all down. This is what I call cheap and cheerful!"}
{"text":"OMFG. Why haven't I been here before? Could it be I was afraid to put another Korean place into my current rotation (Buk Chang, Thumbs Up, Tofu Village, Kachi)??

I was really craving kimchijjigae today (for non-Korean food eaters, this is a Korean soup with a spicy broth, cubes of tofu, lots of kimchi, some pork and green onions added). 3 of my 4 Korean town favs do not serve this dish and I wanted to try it somewhere other than Thumbs Up.

Sunrise House - winner winner chicken dinner! 

The portion was HUGE and price was LOW! I was given 6 banchan (appetizers) AND they asked me if I wanted more half way through my meal. I almost felt guilty. The kimchijjigae was only $6.50 plus tax. It was served in a larger-than-usual stone pot and they didn't skimp out on the meat either. It was very spicy :)

The place was packed with Koreans, a table of 8 old Korean men and women filling up the back. Bright green walls decorated with photos of all the food, makes ordering a breeze. Waitress was cute, service prompt. Old lady in the kitchen cooking up a storm.

They do hot pot here! Various kinds, cheap price range - $12.99 to $15.99 for 2 people!

I honestly can't get over how much food I was served for $6.50. 

I'll be back."}
{"text":"3.75. This place is not as cheap as it used to be but the portions are generous and the side dishes yummy. The tofu bimbimbap is my go to order but I've also tried the seafood pancake and it was pretty good. I recommend sharing dishes as the portions are large and you can try more variety. Also the restaurant is small so if you can go at all hours it's best to as the wait can be quite long."}
{"text":"Honest review from me who loves Korean foods.
Pros:
Big portions
Cheap prices
La kalbi awesome taste with awesome price

Cons:
Pork bone soup not the best. The spice, the taste, its not good period. Makkal chon or yummy korean or icheon is better. I was disappointed. 
Tight space
Place not well maintain. 
I wont come back."}
{"text":"This place is usually busy with a small line up but that's because it's so worth it. The food is great and the portions are huge. Prices are cheaper than most places in Koreatown, and as many people mentioned already, it is cash only which is a bit of a drawback for me as someone who doesn't usually carry cash. I usually order the pork bone soup and at $7.99, can't go wrong. Spicy broth, generous portion with heaps of meat. Side dishes are good with refills. Beware though, their food carries some heat so do request it to be less spicy if you need to. Been frequenting this place for a long time and will definitely be coming back again and again. Limited seating so we try to come during off hours."}
{"text":"Small cash only place with about 10 tables and amazing food. Be prepared to wait for at least 15 mins on weekend. We ordered the bibimbap with chicken in a hot stone bowl and the kimchi fried rice with chicken in a hot stone bowl. The bibimbap was yummy but the kimchi fried rice is average with hardly any chicken. 

The food comes in with 6 free side dishes (kimchi, sautéed seaweed, potatoes, cold glass noodles, pickled radish noodles, and I don't remember the last one). The hot stone bowl keeps the food really hot till the end so be careful if your not good at tolerating hot food. Our bill anount was about 32 bucks for the two of us. We would definitely go to this place again to try other things. For dessert you can head to PAT's near by and grab a custard taiyaki on the go."}
{"text":"This is the best Korean restaurant I have ever been to.

I wouldn't say it beats mama's home cooking, but sometimes it's on par (don't tell my mom).

Whenever my friends from Kingston visit for a weekend, I always suggest getting Korean food here. There's apparently no Asian food in or around Queens, so they're always excited to eat at Sunrise and it never disappoints them.

I get the same thing every time. My favourite stew, the fermented soy bean stew, and a platter of sticky rice seafood pancakes to share. 

There are a few annoying things though:
- I've found hair in my food 3x, and when I addressed it the first time they remade the stew in minutes but it tasted like garbage and completely diluted and wasnt hot. But the place is so good most of the time that I just dont bother complaining anymore if I find hair in my food.
- The middle aged Korean lady working there is extremely rude to you if you're not Korean or speak Korean to her
- It's debit or cash only

I think one of the most important experiences at a Korean restaurant are the side dishes. You gotta have an abundance of good side dishes with various flavours and textures to really satisfy those savoury cravings. Sunrise house is fairly generous with their side dishes, just maybe don't ask for them for the 4th time if you're a smaller group...

Averages about $10-15 per person and you will leave in a food coma and not being able to eat your next meal.

Talking about this place makes me wana go get some right now! Literally drooling.

(UPDATE: found a silk worm or shrimp looking bug in my kelp side dish. So... beware of the kelp)"}
{"text":"Discovering this place, was like discovering jackpot. The Korean food here is amazing, and I often eat at many different Korean restaurants! The food felt like home cooked meals, and were delicious. Although being a little spicy, I enjoyed the food here very much. The side dishes here were amazing! The staff amazing! This is my definitely my new-go to place for Korean. Did I mention, my girlfriend can't get enough of the food here! We often order alot of take outs from this place!"}
{"text":"I dont know why this time i feel kind of bad. The food was not yummy like before. I order 1 chicken stew hot pot, and they said for it need to wait 25 mns. Because we were super hungry, we order 1 more rice cake to eat during wAiting for the hotpot. The server just stay there and didnt bring for us any banchan until we require.
The rice cake u can ask for spicy or not. We chose spicy. This kind of oily and make us feel bored very quickly. Not too much beef but it is okay because the price just only 9$ and it has a lot of rice cakes also. 
The hot pot was very boring, just a little bit of chicken, not too much meat and the rest is hot pepper and onion. The most terrible is very oily, OMG we have to remove a lot of oil before eating and made us have stomachache. I dont prefer to eat this hot pot. 
The price is cheap, i think we cannot expect more sth else. And around 7pm, this is rush hour, they line up to eat. We should hurry up, cannot let people wait for us when we were talkative here. 
I dont know how about others dishes, with this price, i can try again here one more time. Hope be better."}
{"text":"The price is good for student or people who just joined work, but the taste is not very yummy"}
{"text":"The other reviews may sound good, but our experience was horrible. They first sat us at a table crammed by the kitchen and drinks. The waitress was crabby and not inviting. We ordered a squid dish and a tofu soup. We SPECIFICALLY asked for unspicy. We had our korean friend to eat with us. When the food came, the portions were huge (good thing). We brought our kids with us and ordered the squid dish. they couldn't eat it. It was super spicy even though we asked for no spice at all. My mouth was burning and we couldn't handle it. We asked the waitress to get us another plate since my kids were literally crying from the spice. She was very rude and barked back at us instead of just getting us a new plate. She argued with us saying that we said \"milder\" not \"unspicy\". She stated that this is \"hardcore Korean spice\" but even our korean friend couldn't handle it. Nobody in Toronto can eat this dish without drinking 5 cups of water. It was a horrible experience. The meal was so spicy that I took my kids out to get a sandwich. Zero tips given."}
{"text":"CASH ONLY!!
I went during a time there were around 2 parties waiting before us, about 15 minutes of a wait. I ordered the spicy bulgogi (stir fried bulgogi with squid & vegetables along with steamed rice). I must say that I was very surprised with the portion they gave me. For $9, they actually gave a lot, they packed both the meat and rice. It was also very delicious, I highly recommend!! I could not finish the dish due to the fact that someone who cannot eat salty food well and a drink before coming here. I brought the rest home and reheated it, just as good. Next time I come back, I will probably most likely get the same dish again."}
{"text":"Delicious Korean food! While there are many Korean restaurants on Bloor Street, this is the one where the locals go. It's a small place with only a few tables. The food is authentic and prepared by Koreans, not Chinese people...LOL. I ordered the spicy squid bibimbap while my friend had the regular bibimbap with meat and veggies. The food is prepared quickly and served pipping hot. The side dishes were well seasoned and you can always ask for me if you run out. There's not much in terms of decor. You go in, order, eat yummy Korean food, then you get out. It's cash only, but these inexpensive dishes that are mostly under $10, you can't really complain. I only wish I can find an authentic delicious and inexpensive Korean restaurant here in Mississauga!"}
{"text":"The pork bone soup here isn't that great... Actually, it's not great at all. The pork doesn't absorb any flavour and the soup is just spicy water. There are many other places on this street with good pork bone soup.

The one good thing about Sunrise is it's tteokboki, which is really good in all it's forms, like the bulgogi tteokboki and the ramyun tteokboki."}
{"text":"We come here mainly for the food. It's a little hole-in-the-wall restaurant with about 10 tables. It's not aesthetically pleasing or instagram worthy if that's your concern. The portions are huge, enough to feed at least two. It's cash only so be prepared! There's usually a line out the door since there's limited seating. It's worth the wait for a cheap, delicious, hearty meal."}
{"text":"Their pork bone soup is awesome! Great value for your money as well as it's only $8. Their waiters do at times seem stressed out as the restaurant is very busy but all in all I love this place!"}
{"text":"Prob one of my fave korean places in Toronto so far! Love how price already includes tax... the portions are huge so you def get a really good value here. We shared two dishes among three people and were all pretty stuffed in the end. Got the beef bibimbap and seafood pancake, both were really good. Will def come back when I'm craving korean food!"}
{"text":"this is for Rice cakes we had last weekend, the portions were super big so I had to pack to go because I couldn't finish in spite of great taste! fast and good service again. Since this dish was a bit heavy for the already humid and balmy summer weather I'll be having bi bim bap again next time :))"}
{"text":"Among the many Korean restaurants on the Christie/Bloor strip, I came here because all the reviews raved about it!  It's a small restaurant  with slightly sticky tables, but the prices are cheap($20 for two people including tax and tip?  Wowza!) and the portions are massive.  That being said, I ordered a tofu bibimbap in a stone bowl, and was slightly disappointed - it was just nothing to write home about, you know?  I mean, the rice was crispy  and delicious, but the tofu was just okay.  I left with an overall \"so-so\" feeling."}
{"text":"I don't know why I don't come here more often - it's a solid spot to get a meal for under $10. They're really generous with their banchan (side dishes) and have a great variety. My go-to is the kimchi stew with assorted sausages, pork and tofu. I love the twist they have over other restaurants cause they also add some rice cakes and ramen in the mix. I Iove spicy food and I was choking on this so if you can't handle spice, I would recommend you request for mild. Definitely give this place a try and it'll eventually become a Korean favourite."}
{"text":"The price is nice
The starters are awesome
Fried rice cake is very delicious
But the pork bone soup is not salty at all...
I might prefer salty ones haha"}
{"text":"Love love LOVE this little Korean restaurant!!!  There are always lineups whenever i frequent this place, no matter what time.  After all, the food's super delicious, with lots to choose from on the menu.  The prices are pretty cheap for the quantity given.
I ordered pork bone stew for only $7.  It came with a bowl of rice and 6 refillable side dishes.  There were a fair amount of bones in the bowl.  The bones were meaty and tender.  My friend and i also ordered stir fried rice with kimchi in a hot stone pot for $9.  Both those dishes have enough spice to tease my pallet. 
Other good points of the restaurant: 
- near the subway station
- free street parking
- free wifi
Just make sure to bring cash with since they don't accept cards!!!!!"}
{"text":"This hole in the wall is really good. I had the bulgoghi and my fiancé had the pork bone. The pork bone is nothing special but the bulgoghi is really good. We ended up sharing a table with strangers cuz it was so busy. And for that I give them 4 stars only."}
{"text":"Great hole in the wall Korean place! Unfortunately I couldnt tell you what we ate as we left our friends who are much more familiar with Korean food order. The seafood pancakes are the exception as they were soooo good!"}
{"text":"Had the 2 people pork bone soup. Although not nearly as good as in Korea, it wasn't bad. The broth was pretty tasty and I liked the vegetables/side dishes. 

I give this place 2 stars because, call me high-maintenance, but it was too dirty for me. The portable gas range they used was covered in soup stains.. which I understand if it was used that same day, but when she opened the compartment to change out the gas, there were so many crumbs and random sh*t in there.... I had to try hard not to lose my appetite (I was starving so trucked on). It makes me think what else they don't clean. The table itself was grimy too. Hate to bash on the place since the food was decent, so hopefully they take a note and put more effort into cleanliness."}
{"text":"Great food at great prices! I'm a new fan of this place! 

+ CASH ONLY!
+ They serve a wide variety of food here from soups/stews, main dishes, appetizers, and larger food sets for groups. I tried the bulgogi and squid served with rice - great stuff. I also tried the pork bone soup which was okay
+ Dishes are very reasonably priced and taste amazing
+ They give you a very generous portion of rice with your dishes
+ The spicy is quite spicy! If you aren't that great with spice, be sure to ask for a mild spicy
+ The place gives a very home-ey feel 
+ It usually gets busy here during peak hours on Friday and the weekends
+ Side dishes are great - you get 4-6 side dishes. I'm a fan of the seaweed and the kimchi"}
