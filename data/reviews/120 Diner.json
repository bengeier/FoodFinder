{"text":"Calamari was aweful, probably the worst I've ever had and to top it off the marinate tasted like liquidy ketchup.
The Jumbo shit coated in Coconut was also aweful, coating was bad and disproportionate.
Bruchetta was actually really good, but they didnt specify it having Star anise, which was pleasant but in my book, and my brother whom was so disappointed he gave it up after 2 bites, it shouldn't even be called bruchetta, but to state again I thought it tasted wonderful.

On the mains. I got the Veggie burger, it was really good and I was really happy with it, as was the person who also got one.
Quinoa stir fry was incredibly average and had no character. Other meals were not comment on the others.

Gender neutral washrooms were awesome. 
The talent that night was sublime."}
{"text":"The 120 Diner is a jewel. Great food, chef prepared and the best live music you can imagine, six nights a week. We have been going there for over a year and always enjoy ourselves. Great staff/service, no attitude, which is rare, and the owners make you feel like a 'regular' even if it is your first time there. Not may places in Toronto that support live music, and they book in the best."}
{"text":"Club120 Dinner is a new restaurant that had its grand opening the week I was in Toronto. I am a lover of food, mostly all types of food. But if you offer me a restaurant with \"comfort food\" I will be the first in line to try it out. I am also very picky, more times than not I always have a complaint about something.  I am happy to report that I have nothing but praise and high hopes for this new gem in Toronto. From the food to the atmosphere everything was perfect both times I went. 

On my first visit I choose the Mac & Cheese as well as a Poutine. The portions were huge! I had a friend with me and we shared the dishes and neither of us could finish either dish. We wanted to but we also wanted to save room for dessert. We choice the whopper chocolate melt cake. It was as divine as it sounds. Moist with that crunchy top of whoppers.  As we ate we got to watch the comedy show they had on stage. It was a jammed packed 2 hours of funny and a full belly.

My second visit was the next afternoon. This time I wanted to try the homemade Fried chicken with Mashed potatoes. Again, anther amazing dish! The chicken was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. The potatoes were homemade and had great texture! Of course I had the same dessert as the night before and again it was perfect.

I cannot wait to go back on my next trip"}
{"text":"This place is a gem! We discovered 120 Diner online when looking for stand-up comedy in the city, and it definitely delivered. To me, it had all the ingredients of a perfect Saturday night: beer, poutine, and some good, dark humour. 

THE GOOD:
- 120D has a good ol' diner menu - think nachos, burgers, and poutine with crowd-pleasing twists. My man and I shared the No Name Poutine, which came with avocado, sour cream, and blue cheese in addition to the curds and gravy. In other words, it was all of my favourite things on one plate. Two big thumbs up here, but be wary if you're not a blue cheese fan - it was pungent! 
- The show was over two hours and featured an awesome lineup of comedians, each with their own style and flair. You're bound to find someone that leaves you cracking up. As someone who loves stand-up comedy and regularly watches the comedic greats on YouTube (I'm Louis C.K.'s biggest fan), it was refreshing to see some new faces - and enjoy them live! 
- The show was actually free of charge, making for a memorable and affordable date night.

THE BAD:
- No complaints here - 5/5 stars!

I think 120 Diner is one of the city's best kept secrets, and I can't wait to return. If you could do with some laughs during your next night out, be sure to swing by."}
{"text":"We were at 120 Diner last Fri for the Ori Dagan show. The place is very nice and cozy, the food was quite decent for a diner. We shared \"smart\" salad (yes, that's how it's called in the menu), my husband had spicy tuna melt and I had a mushroom ravioli. The portions were quite large, I had a hard time finishing my meal. I would probably rate the food and drinks quality vs. price at 3.5 stars, but these guys deserve extra credit for hosting TD Jazz Festival shows."}
{"text":"Dinner and a comedy show? Don't mind if I do!

120 Diner is a trendy diner with a stage. Every night there is a different show, so I checked out their schedule and decided Friday's Comedy Kapow was the show for me. My cousin lives downtown, so we met up to see what this place is all about. She asked her friends about it beforehand and heard a lot of people come in for drinks, but not many had tried the food yet.

Let's start with dinner. This is a comfort food kind of place, so this was perfect. Starving after a long day, we both asked the server and the manager what they'd recommend. They both said meatloaf. Meatloaf?! You have all of these interesting, tempting dishes and you recommend the meatloaf??! WTF? My cousin was curious and ordered the Meatloaf & Mash and I chose the Chef's Burrito. We also got the Coconut Shrimp for an appetizer.

The Coconut Shrimp were huge! We received 5 large shrimp in a thick coconut coating. It was so thick, the poor shrimp could barely hold it! With it came a tasty chipotle dressing that balanced out the sweetness of the coconut. Mmmmmm. My pet peeve was the quantity; unless you have 5 people, when is 5 a good #? Maybe, I just like even #s.

Our entrees have arrived. My cousin's plate looked like home cooked goodness; meatloaf, mashed potatoes, gravy and peas. We were both super curious about the meatloaf, so we both had a taste. Impressive. It was seasoned and flavourful, almost like it was made with roast beef rather than ground beef. Not to mention, the gravy was delicious. We loved it. I will now rethink my menu choices and not discount the meatloaf!

My burrito was GIGANTIC.There were so many layers, it was hard to pick out specific flavours; especially when the heat kicked in. I took It apart a little to see what was going on. It says the beans were supposed to be refried, but they were whole. The guacamole packed some heat! All of the toppings were plentiful and they didn't overuse the rice for filler. I could only eat about 2/3 of it and I still wanted to undo a button my pants.

Since we were at the point, why not get dessert? My cousin loves lemon, so Lemon Squares it was. I was intrigued by the Peanut Butter & Jam Pie. The lemon squares were light, but packed a lemony punch. A dessert I probably should've got after the massive meal, but I have no regrets. The PB & J pie. The crust was peanut butter cookies and the filling was jam topped with a dollop of PB. The PB cookies were fresh and fantastic. The cookies paired with the raspberry jam were a match made in my tummy. The menu does not lie; this IS an epic dessert!

Now for the show. Unless posted on their website, the shows are free. Friday's show had several different comics, new and experienced, young and old. A very diverse show that was fun and entertaining. Each comic had their own distinct style and sense of humour, so there was something for literally everyone. They also have a monthly themed murder mystery that is $10 and I want to go!

I have 5 words to describe the evening: I wish I lived closer. Great entertainment, great atmosphere, great food, not to mention, great service. It's a one stop shop!"}
{"text":"The only good things I have to say is that is a very classy place good food friendly staff.  I happen to have gone there on April 30th Saturday with buddy of mine and they had a jazz band playing . Now the problem is I am not sure if it was a band member or some one from the restaurant but this person gave a big speach on the mic how that this club does not have a cover charge so that it is mandatory to tip the band this person went table to table with a tip jar and a debit machine wanting tips  I do believe that the band is payed to play  there and that you should never be forced or  bullied into tipping so I would go for the food   and stay away on jazz night so you don't get bullied into tipping."}
{"text":"The Spicy Fish Sandwich had an oven-poached basa fish between two layers of bread with jalapenos, cheese, sambal sauce, and spicy mayo.  This came with an order of onion rings (you can choose different sides like sweet potato fries, salad, poutine -- I actually did want to try their poutine but we had already ordered an incredible assortment of food).

The Spicy Fish Sandwich was absolutely delicious!!!  The oven-poached basa fish was so tender, so soft, and not rich in flavour that it paired perfectly with the gooey melted cheese, and the spiciness of the jalape√±os and spicy mayo.  I really, really adored this sandwich!  If anything, you must try this sandwich here at 120 Diner."}
{"text":"Didn't come here for dinner but I did attend their Comedy Ka-Pow show where a friend was taking part of the show.  I highly recommend attending as it is a mix of amateur, up and coming, and more established comedians.  You can't beat the ticket price of $5 for a 2 hours of laughs and then there is karaoke after!

The place was packed and they were just trying to find chairs everywhere they could because the place was at capacity due to the popularity of the event."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE 120 Diner.  Friendly owners and staff and the food is really good! Leagues beyond any pub food I have ever had. I would not compare this to a pub though, this place has class.   I'm a bit of a regular there and I have never heard anything negative about the food from other patrons.  The I don't have a name burger is divine.  The service is great and they have live entertainment every night of the week with a wonderful Open mic/Open Mic jazz night on Wednesday evenings at 8pm.  Men are of course welcome too!  

This is a listening venue which is such a nice change for Toronto.  You get music and a show, which is a huge treat! Patrons are asked at the start of the show to keep voices to a quiet level so that one can enjoy the music. 

Don't miss out, check it out!"}
{"text":"Food was really bad. Would not suggest going here for dinner. I had the rice bowl and it was very dry and plain. Comedy show was good."}
{"text":"I had been to the location many times before when it was Spring Rolls.  Nothing has changed decor wise other than the fact that they have a stage at the front now where they had a sign for karaoke that began at 8:30pm on the Friday I stopped in.  The place had many tables open, only about 8-10 customers.  

The burrito had beef, beans, rice and quacamole.  Although the menu states that it's one of the \"Chef's specialties\", it was the worst burrito I have ever had.  No flavour, overly mushy (usually I expect the tortilla on the outside to be crisp having been grilled).  The worst part was that they added jalapenos without telling me (they were not listed as an ingredient on the menu).  I do not like spicy food, and by the time I realized there were jalapenos it was too late, I had already left.  I had to sift through the mush to pick them out as I ate..

For a location that was essentially dead, I waited way too long for my food.  I called for quick take out (something I do frequently at a busy diner down the street from me).  I gave them 15 minutes and walked over.  When I arrived, I realized how dead it was, and saw that one table had food and the other didn't seem to be eating.  Regardless, I waited another 15 minutes while my food was made.

Although it's close to my office, I most certainly will not be coming here again.  My advice to them:  stick to the nightclub business."}
{"text":"Comfort to the core! My cousin and I were here months, if not years, ago and have been clawing to go back ever since. The two-sided menu (one for drinks, one for food) has everything you might crave; as well as unique combos (like meatloaf and Mac'n'cheese) that you wouldn't necessarily consider. On our second visit, I had their Mac'n'cheese which was divine! My only criticism was that the sauce could have had a little more zing and cheese, it's very mild. Accompanying it was a zesty selection of greens.

I should mention the menu has a large number of 'add to everything' options so really you can create the meal you desire. 

Putting the amazing food aside. They have a packed schedule of musicians, comedians and karaoke that are high quality. Instead of a cover charge, they collect a 'pay what you can' to cover the costs. Both times these acts have been of such high quality that it's well worth the small contribution! 

The staff are friendly, attentive, and make the experience that much better (if that's possible). If I lived closer, it would be my go to joint!

You gotta check this place out!"}
{"text":"Came here for the comedy night. Had some munchies and drinks. Everything was pretty amazing, they definitely don't cheap on ingredients. This is the first time I've seen nachos with more toppings than nachos!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday at 7pm and it was EMPTY (this probably hurt them a little, as the atmosphere seemed sad and the service was just average as a result of no one being there). 

We ordered the acclaimed meatloaf with mash and a grilled cheese burger. The meatloaf was meaty, the mash was made with real potatoes and had nice lumps, and the blanched carrots on the side were perfectly done! The grilled cheese burger was good (A LOT of cheese, which we didn't love), and the waiter put the sauce on the burger, even though we had specifically asked that they not. The fries were also pretty good. The food should all have been 5-10 degrees warmer. 

Would I come back, maybe, but probably only for the meatloaf....there are also so many places to try in the city, so I don't know if I'll be rushing back."}
{"text":"Performances were all good, however I'm not too sure if I liked the atmosphere. Don't get me wrong, I'm not the party type nor I like loud music, the atmosphere here was just... too quiet. The crowds were older and everyone was really quiet (to enjoy the music which is understandable). But it was to the point even if I whispered some words or pick up my fork to grab a bite, THEY WILL ALL LOOK AT ME. My friend and I ended up texting to each other whenever it is needed to avoid the crowds judging us. 

Pub food is well, pub food - decent but wasn't that bad. *EDIT* Drinks weren't strong to my taste, but could have been human error when creating the mix *EDIT*

-Crunchy Coconut Shrimp ($11.95)
the coconut crust to be a bit too thick and the chilli in the mayo was undetectable. Otherwise the shrimps were sweet and juicy, while the coconut crust was crispy without being greasy.

-Bruschetta (tomato, basil & parmesan on a warm baguette) - $6.95
While the baguette was soft and cheesy with the slightly melted parmesan, perhaps some prosciutto would have been nice for a bit of a crunchy texture.

-Turkey Sliders (3 housemade turkey burgers with cranberry mayo and crispy fried onions) - $12.95
The turkey patty was dry and  I actually informed the owner about it, however he didn't seem happy when he heard about it.. The sauce didn't have that distinct cranberry flavor that I expected either and overall I wasn't too happy with the dish.

-Ravioli (Spinach & ricotta ravioli with marinara sauce) - $13.95
The ravioli were rubbery with a grainy cheese filling, and I found the marinara sauce to be underwhelming.

-I Don't Have a Name Burger (6 oz. of beef, avocado, blue cheese, swiss cheese and sour cream) - $15.95
Unlike the slider, the beef patty was perfectly medium rare and blue cheese wasn't as overpowering as I would have thought."}
{"text":"Mandy's famous mac & cheese is my favourite my gosh so melt in your mouth delicious, The shameful bowls are gigantic and really are filled with everything you can imagine and you can even add more add-ons... I ordered a shameful bowl and I'm still eating it two days later, extremely generous with their portions,

For dessert I had the short cake which wasn't very short it was gigantic and tall and so amazing! 


I definitely will order from them again their food was well priced portions were gigantic and so good:)"}
{"text":"120 Diner definitely lives up to its name. Attended a Saturday night comedy night here. I had a great time. Not sure if the name is literal or not but it seems more of a pub to me. But then again that could be attributed to the fact that it was set up that way for the evening. 

It is conveniently located near Queens Subway Station. You can find the washroom in the basement. The bathrooms are unisex and it annoyed me that they all opened from the inside due to space limitations. They however, had great music playing. 

The bar is convenient at the back of the place which makes socializing easy with the set up of the stage. Booths as well as tables makes for a nice neat little place. 

They launched their 420 menu which does not contain what you think:) I ordered water which was so specific...I thought the waiter would be annoyed. It turns out she was so calm and professional to my order of cold water with no ice and lemon. Thanks for that! 

I tried their nachos from my friends order. Nothing too different from the nachos you would get at another place. Except that they diced avocados on top as garnish. I had their buffalo chicken wings. I got about 8 very large wings. My order came out quickly. It was about $13. It came with two pieces of carrots and two pieces of celery sticks. You have to buy dipping sauce at an extra cost. The chicken wings came with hot sauce but I found it at the end of finishing the wings because it was at the bottom. The wings were full of chunky bits of meat and deep fried just the way I like it. Served hot it was a good meal. It was not particularly that flavourful though. 

Overall, I would go here again but would order something different on the menu. A bonus for $3.45 shots on the night I was there!"}
{"text":"Sold Out Event!  Came to this Live Music & Comedy restaurant tonight.  I'm going to be bias to say the show was spectacular since my sister-in-law was performing.  It was a jazz performance featuring Jyoti Janardan & Lisa Simone.  Performance was definitely 5 stars!

There were lots on the menu but to be honest I didn't really read it.  I did my homework already and knew what was good from all the reviews so I went with the 3 most popular dishes:
1) Spicy Fish Burger - 5/5 - perfectly done!
2) Meatloaf & Mash - 3/5 - it was okay
3) No Name poutine - 4/5 - very nice!

I also want to add that the service was outstanding.  Although our server was very busy given that it was a full house, he was still very friendly and check in with us ever so often.

If you enjoy live music, you should check this place out.  I do suggest you call in advance for booking and check out the calendar posted on their webpage for all the performances."}
{"text":"Went here with friends for a Comedy night and stayed after to listen to a bit of Kareoke. 
Fun night over all, pub like food was well... pub like food and not bad. 
Service was friendly and fast.  
I had apps and a drink at Carbon before the show, I should have just stayed here for the munchies and drinks, nothing fancy and reasonably priced.
Place was packed, will be back."}
{"text":"Totally enjoyed the Comedians at 120 Diner this past Saturday night. James Cawley, new to the comedy game put on a great show as did all the other comedians.
I recommend reservations as the place is quite cozy and fills up fast. 
Service is great and the chicken wings are extremely good.
Afterwards karaoke.
All in all I highly recommend this place."}
