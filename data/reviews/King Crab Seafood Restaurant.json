{"text":"Well let's just say I had food poisoning there. Food was alright but I noticed the porcelain decoration they put on my dish was actually dirty.  I would personally would not return there ever."}
{"text":"The staff here have really bad attitudes. Especially if you're a small table and don't order the expensive dishes like the lobster and crab.  We came here frequently because of its proximity to downtown. When they first opened, the food was actually not bad but got progressively worse with each visit (seemed to correlate with the staff's behaviour). Prices also increased exponentially each visit. On our last visit: they gave us the wrong dish, threw our food on the table, had no eye contact, and when serving my mother's birthday cake, they dropped the cake off on our table still in the box...   I have a seafood allergy so never tried the shellfish, but my parents and relatives told me it's not too great.   I will never come here again. Unfortunately, we will go back to Fishman Clubhouse in Markham since they know how to treat their customers well and their quality of food is top notch."}
{"text":"Great service, delicious food. We had a 4 pound lobster cooked with green onion and garlic (excellent) plus a huge plate of chicken fried rice and a Sichuan chicken dish. They also have free wifi!   We will definitely be back with a larger group to try their king crab dishes!"}
{"text":"The prices were high and the food was not good. Feel like you can get better at Fishman Club House. Did not love anything. Was not the best lobster but was passable. Food came with a weird butternut squash soup that did not taste like Asian food. I would not go back again. Better places in Chinatown."}
{"text":"Best cantonese lobster in chinatown. It was perfectly cooked, and it was not greasy whatsoever. I really enjoyed the authentic feel of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Other reviewers have this pegged right. It's a cheaper version (in price, not in quality) of fisherman villa. All of the lobster and king crab is fresh. The other crab (Vancouver) might not be fresh, since the meat sticks to the shell. I'll definitely be back here again to try the king crab and lobster banquet with the family."}
{"text":"I would have to admit this is one of possibly three Chinese restaurants I would recommend to visit in Chinatown (Dundas St. W. and Spadina Ave. area).   Food is definitely above par for even the other higher end establishments downtown, but I would suggest dressing very comfortably so as to allow for unrestricted tummy expansion and the occasional for splatter from your own messy struggle with all the crustaceans."}
{"text":"Great food at a great price. If you like Fisherman Lobster Clubhouse in Scarborough, I highly recommend this place as a much cheaper alternative. Perfect for a smaller group of people, they have a $58 special that includes a lobster, crab, fish in soup and a vegetable dish. Add ons are also very reasonably priced, $5-$20. For myself and 3 aunties, we spent about $80 with 2 extra dishes. Sweet and sour pork, which does not have the red food colouring and upgraded the veg to morning glory.  Very fresh (like Fisherman, there are lobster and crab tanks along the wall), little or no msg. I'm not sensitive to msg at all, I only know that I wasn't dying of raging thirst afterwards.  Located very close to AGO, about 3 minutes west on Dundas.  10/10 would suffer the drive back downtown to come here."}
{"text":"Sitting in the restaurant for more than one hour and only one dish was served. Additionally, the waiter's attitude was pretty bad. :( they just don't care about 2-3 ppl tables at all."}
{"text":"This is the best place in Chinatown for seafood hands down! I got the $88 lobster dinner for three. Everything was made to perfection the fried rice had that wok flavour that good fried rice should have. The lobster was cooked perfectly with a lot of meat and the right amount of flavour for both the dish with noodles and the typhoon lobster. The staff was great and very attentive, changing our plates when it got dirty. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Was very excited to try this place! I went with my s/o for lunch so we didn't have much of an appetite we just wanted to try the food since we're not from the area. We didn't order much and I felt like we were being watched the whole time eating. We did get the lobster maggi sauce which was ok. We were pressured from the waitress to get more food, and then Got a weird vibe the whole time because we didn't eat much."}
