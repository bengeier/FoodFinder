{"text":"I ordered the Carbonara dish.  The portion size was fine but the dish was extremely salty and there wasn't enough sauce to cover the pasta.  There was barely any sauce; maybe 3 tablespoons.  They advertised that the sauce was rich and creamy and I found it to be neither.  It you're in a pinch, this truck is ok but I wouldn't go out of my way to try it again."}
{"text":"Decent Italian on the go.  Had the homemade gnocchi with organic beef bolognese.  Gnocchi had a good texture, came out quickly, and was a portion large enough for a normal lunch.  The sauce had a good depth of flavour, but could definitely use more meat.  The bread slice provided to mop up the sauce was useful but otherwise unremarkable.  I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, but if it's in sight and you're peckish, twill serve handily."}
{"text":"Homemade pasta from a truck at a music festival?   I had the gnocchi from Aglio e Olio at the Calgary XFest this year and enjoyed it. I wanted something more filling and a better value than the other trucks around but I don't think I really got it. They say that their pasta is homemade but you would never know that from the taste. It was a pretty average lunch, and I won't be rushing back anytime soon.  Average pasta, but it does come from a truck!"}
