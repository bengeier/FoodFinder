{"text":"One after another, so many have tried to open a food place in this very same spot. Along comes this chinese food establishment and BINGO! I have tried it a few times and the last time, it was packed, and with mostly chinese people ;)  In all my favorite is anything noodles. That tasty well seasoned wok in the kitchen sure makes it taste good every time. The young waiter staff is at a loss every time, so you gotta take charge here, for instance, don't wait for your check. For you gringos, you gotta ask for anything more than chopsticks, cause they won't ask or provide them, but hey, get it together and learn. Food is good and consistent."}
{"text":"They have very good food. I like the pig ear and beef noodle soup. And We went to other locations in Tempe that one not so good. The Chandler locations are the best."}
{"text":"I am really like it...When I was eating in there?it is always made me miss my hometown. Everything is really perfect.This is my best kitchen in AZ."}
{"text":"This place just had 6 health code violations this past week...made the dirty dining list.  One item was a filthy soda machine....will be removing this place off my list!  Check it out on Dirty Dining Channel 5 in AZ."}
{"text":"I'm always looking for healthy foods in my neighborhood. We've ordered from Chou's multiple times. The eggplant/jalapeno dish has been good in the past, but often it is too oily and \"mushy\"/overcooked. Please keep in mind, I'm not a stickler for authentic Chinese food, just looking for places that serve delicious vegetarian/plant based foods when I don't have time to cook.  I may try one more time to see if there has been improvement with over cooking the food and adding too much oil."}
{"text":"We are from Seattle and Chicago so are used to good Asian food. We were so excited to walk in this place and be the only caucasians in there. We knew it would be good! Everything we have tried is wonderful! Scratch steamed buns and dumplings are amazing. Staff is helpful and friendly! Still haven't found a good , authentic Korean place. Any suggestions? The chicken with Chinese mushrooms is lovely!"}
{"text":"Highly recommended.  Authentic Northeast food.  Customers mostly northern Mandarin speakers.  So if you want to try something new and avoid the glop that passes for Cantonese/Sichuan (needless to say, the glop is not authentic anything), check this place out."}
{"text":"Tried Chou's Kitchen today due to favorable reviews; I was not disappointed.  My friend and I tried the veggie spring rolls, the juicy pork dumplings, and veggie noodle stir-fry.  All were very yummy.  Other reviews mention slow service and that was the case for us today.  The server was very nice and all smiles but we ordered before the table next to us and ALL of their food was served to them before even 1 of our items was brought to our table.  I also had a Diet Coke and it was a warm can of soda paired with a small glass of ice.  I paid a $1.50 for a can of soda.  I won't do it at a vending machine and I won't do it here again. Bottom Line:   My friend and I did enjoy our food and are looking forward to going back to try other menu items."}
{"text":"I don't know how anyone can say anything but amazing things about this place. We can go every week and order the same thing and never get sick of it. It's always consistent and delicious.  For soup we get the wonton soup. I like to add in a little soy sauce. Those wontons sure are tasty! The soup comes out very hot so give it a chance to cool off before divulging. We also get an order of potstickers and of course an order (or 2) of their juicy pork steamed dumplings. You can not come here and not have those dumplings. They are Amazing! As for entrees we really enjoy the Mongolian beef and house special noodles. Sooo good!!  Also, the beef pies are pretty tasty!!! The staff has always been friendly to us and keeps our water glasses full."}
{"text":"family run hand pulled noodle shop - nothing fancy - but its clean and the staff is nice.  I got the oxtail soup with shaved noodles and it hit the spot. Added bonus, the kitchen has a window so you can see them making your order."}
{"text":"Super awesome authentic Chinese food! And there is a lot of variety so it never gets boring~"}
{"text":"We were here early Saturday. We will never return. It was the absolute WORST asian food we have had in 18 years in the valley. When the house stir fried noodle mix arrived, they could have delivered a pot of oil it was so greasy. How anyone can like this restaurant is beyond comprehension."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely fantastic! My dad and I come here all the time and we just eat the appetizers and that's it! So good! I could eat here everyday!"}
{"text":"Great food a decent price.  Made from scratch in front of you with a smile.  The green onion pancakes are awesome!  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"LOVE this restaurant. So many tasty choices! Best northern chinese food in AZ. I feel so happy to go here."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite spots! Love the soup dumplings. Sunny is the best! Really friendly and sweet."}
{"text":"I eat at their location in Chandler often, I love the food. I was very excited about this location opening. I just had a very off putting interaction with the man who answered the phone when I tried to get a menu so that we could do a work group order. There's no menu on line. When I was asked if they could fax me a menu I was told no.  I told him that without a menu that we could not order from them, he said that was fine with him.  I don't think I will be going to this location if that's the way someone who is trying to give them business is treated. I am very disappointed."}
{"text":"Chou's Kitchen is a really cute restaurant serving a type of Chinese cuisine that's hard to come by! The ladies who own the restaurant are always there, one making buns and dumplings, and one running the front of the house. When asked what to order, the owner will point you in the direction of the steamed beef buns, the cheapest and tastiest item on the menu! The fried chicken noodles are also delicious and nothing on this menu is expensive! It's easy to have a filling meal for two come out to $15 after tip!  The place is rather small so you may have to wait for a table, but as evidenced by the sound of Mandarin being spoken throughout the restaurant, it is clearly a place that has good food."}
{"text":"This is a very authentic chinese food place.  The wait staff was extremely friendly and helpful in picking out our meal.  We had the kung pao chicken, the short ribs and the potstickers.  All were excellent.  My only reservation was that the chicken was deep fried.  That said, I highly recommend this spot.  They have an extensive menu and we will be returning."}
{"text":"Had the pork & cabbage dumplings and the spicy beef tendon/tripe, excellent!!  The dumplings were fresh and juicy, and the tendon/tripe wasn't chewy at all, nice firm texture.  Plenty of interesting things to try on the menu!! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I am struggling if I should give this place an honest review. It's a small authentic restaurant that's already getting too much business and unless you really are a foodie and appreciate authentic Chinese Comfort food, you won't appreciate the preciousness of the place. Don't come here expecting Sweet Sour Pork or any of those non-sense. Come for their handmade specialties.   I have a few must haves whenever I go to Chou's Kitchen. Their dumplings, chive box, and beef pie are to die for. Be extremely careful when you bite into the beef pie though. The skillful food maker was able to pack all the juiciness of the stuffing into the thin layer of dough before it's pan fried into perfection. They also made their dough for the dumplings from scratch, unlike most the store bought dumpling skins, you can taste the freshness in the mouth. If you are lucky, you may even get to see the cook making dumplings/ pies/ green onion pancakes right in front of your eyes.   Again, don't go there expecting Sweet Sour Pork or Chop Suy! It's an authentic Chinese restaurant. Go there if you have open mind and are ready to know what real Chinese comfort food taste like!"}
{"text":"very clean and food were delicious just like the Chandler location. I always order jalapeno with pork intestine it's sooo good, but also tried new dish this time around, lamb on toothpick like a bite size skewer, it will be my new must order."}
{"text":"One of best Chinese food I have in US - I have lived in Denver, San Diego and LA.  Don't miss their dumpling, Green onion pancakes, Pan Fried Chives and Egg Pockets."}
{"text":"Our go to place for Shan-dong Chinese food. Love the hand made dough dishes and noodles. Their specialty items are delicious as well"}
{"text":"A little bland in my opinion, but its great food if you are into northern Chinese cuisine. The dumplings are great however nonetheless"}
{"text":"I am writing this review for the benefit of vegeterians.I have been to this place twice.The menu card says stir fry egg plant and the item comes with minced pork.Second time, I repeatedly told them not to add egg/meat/pork/chicken/shrimp.half way through eating it, I had meat piece on my spoon.The food might taste well, but this is not the place for vegeterians. I will never go back to this place."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Grew up in Hawaii and have seriously missed some solid Chinese food. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This place is great. The food is Northern Chinese similar to Chinese Muslim food. They have a great variety for reasonable prices. Also, everything is freshly prepared and you can even see them make the dumplings and pork pie behind a glass window. We got the stir fry spinach (bok choy) with garlic, sesame bread, pork and napa cabbage dumplings, pork pie and green onion pancakes. I know its a lot of food but we wanted to try a good variety and it cost about $27. Not to shabby! the spinach and garlic was really fresh and flavorful. The bread was decent, almost like a dense curried bread. The pork dumplings were similar to soup dumplings, one of my most favorite dumplings ever. The pork pie was almost like a pork patty covered in dumpling dough and pan-fried. It was crunchy, moist, juicy and delicious all at the same time. We were getting full so we ended up only eating half of the green onion pancakes which were well prepared. We will definitely be making another trip back here soon.  Side note: They sell bags of frozen/take-home dumplings. About $10 for a bag of 40."}
{"text":"Definitely original! Great food! The green onion pancakes were great as well as the stir fry."}
{"text":"Went here cause of the reviews, the place is small needs some upgrades on the decor, but that doesn't matter it's about the food.  The services was a little slow, and the place kind of loud. The food is good, I noticed people said it was bland. It does lack salt but I don't think you need it because it has so many other flavors. Good food I would go there again we ordered a little of everything."}
{"text":"It is hard to rank this place because its cold dish is good while its hot dish is a meh.  I tried both new and old Chou places now and have the same conclusion."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night and it was a full house. Space limited. We ended up ordering to go. Staff kept apologizing for not be able to serve us.  It was apparent they forgot about us and our food was sitting there for a while. But staff did not acknowledge long wait.    I ordered spicy szechuan beef and my husband ordered orange chicken. Some type of seasoning on beef left my tounge numb.  We also ordered pork potstickers those were delicious. Overall, if we happen to be in the neighborhood again well give it a second try."}
{"text":"Amazing pasta and dumplings made from scratch. Little plates are great and similar enough to Taiwanese cooking than most places I've been to, which is nice.  The owner is really friendly and the service is quick.  We will be back often when we visit AZ."}
{"text":"Heads Up, I have enjoyed Chou's kitchen for the last 2 and a half years. I have a diabetic service dog, the real thing, I went in to make an order last last Thursday, the second Thursday in February. As I walked in with my dog, the waitress stuck her foot out as she was taking an order, like she was a karate kungfu fighter, and shove it in my dog's face! They know me there, they know I have a certified service dog, why she did that, I have no idea? I went back to pick up my food a half hour later without my dog, as I come in they hand me my dinner and say here no charge we're sorry, and you are drunk please leave! I'm sorry I was not drunk, I have high blood pressure my face is red all the time, I have no idea why she even said that!? If I hadn't eaten there so often, I would hire a lawyer and sue them for their misbehavior and I still might. In making an order there, and getting spit in my food or who knows what else. I will call the health department and make sure they have a good certificate."}
{"text":"I am so surprised to find this place. Decent Chinese food! Not the Panda styled fast food. Everything we ordered were beyond my expectations. ???????????????????????so tasty!!! I would recommend it to all Chinese, and anyone who want to try some real mainland China Chinese food (northeast style). The people here is so friendly."}
{"text":"Me and my friends rarely like chinese food in phoenix but I believe we have a winner. The first sign that a place is authentic is when you see many natives eat there and most importantly when a cop walks in. We admittedly went bonkers but tried a whole bunch of stuff- the egg pocket, pork dumplings, lamb and chicken skewer , cumin lamb, fish hot pot in chili oil, schezwan chicken, spinach and garlic, potatoes eggplant and jalapeno. (As the waitress fondly exclaimed..\"you guys are crazy!\"). We liked all the dishes and loved specifically the fish hot pot in chili oil.   Please stop by and try it for tasty, affordable and a culinary delight."}
{"text":"I came here when they just opened ( about 4 years ago), then soon after I moved to another city. When they just opened up, the food was incredibly good- especially the dumplings and beef pancakes- and the services was good! So I went there during this visit again after 4 years, sadly everything is totally different and changed, he food was not as good as before, and the service is horrible. I won't go back again, ever."}
{"text":"I'm continually amazed that people think that China, with its 8 regionl cuisines and varied biomes and some dozen odd ethnic minorities , will always have the same stir fried beef with broccoli and done the way they had it in New York or whatever American Chinese eatery they had growing up.  Please people, this restaurant serves east northern ( dong bei) homestyle wheat based dishes.  They may have some of the American Chinese dishes on the menu but that is  for the clueless diner that wandered  in wantingpork fried rice and egg fo young for  chinese dishes and not what they specialize in.  Please read Jennifer 8's great book on Chinese reataurants and you can undestand what the differences are.   This restaurant does decent and tasty dumplings, green pancakes, breads, buns (man tou)'etc,.  More homestyle but still tasty.  Does it measure up to the best of SGV, MontereyPark, Rowland Hts, ? No.  But its decent and its tasty and I applaud them for opening up here in AZ."}
{"text":"Great food and prompt service, we had the beef cakes, hot and sour soup and the famous juicy pork soup dumplings. New favorite go to Chinese joint!"}
{"text":"Yelp was spot on with this lovely little place.  The food is very authentic and fresh.  The vegetable dishes and noodles were first class."}
{"text":"The shrimp pork chive dumplings were amazing, so much so that I got a second order of them.  Wasn't feeling great to try a larger dish today but I have no question the food here is very good across the board.    Service was okay.  Only one waitress working several tables, but she remained very attentive.  I felt a little like the Seinfeld episode with the Korean nail salon though, where the waitress and all the Chinese people in the restaurant were making fun of me in their native language.  Before I saw the soy sauce on the table, I also asked if there was some sweet and sour sauce or something for my dumplings and the waitress said \"no, those are already tasty enough.\"  I'm the customer, if I think it would taste even better with sauce, they should provide sauce.  I also inquired about getting the orange chicken not deep-fried and was denied.  I wouldn't think that would be that hard to do.  Anyway, food at this place is 4-5 stars, and service is probably fine too, I think there were just some cultural differences that were a little off-putting for me today, hence my 3 star review."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this little place, especially the shrimp fried rice and scallion pancakes. Can't wait to go back and try the dumplings (they were out last time).  It seems to be a well kept secret that is getting out. By the time we left, there was quite a wait to sit."}
{"text":"It's a good restaurant for Chinese foods, bao zi is very delicious and traditional. The manager is nice too. Definitely I will be back again."}
{"text":"I love Fuqifeipian! It is spicy enough and almost beat what I had in China. Mapodoufu  is not quite satisfying. All in all, it is the best Chinese restaurant in town."}
{"text":"Delicious meal, terrific rice... really too bad we both had intestinal backlash when we returned home. Had to use pepto b. Ugh!"}
{"text":"While the decor leaves something to be desired, the feel was similar to some of the neighborhood Chinese restaurants back east.  The food was outstanding and the service excellent.  The owner and staff were helpful and patient and answered all our questions.  The photos of the dishes on the walls really got the engine started.  We are not fans of spicy food, and the Northern Chinese/Manchurian cuisine fits nicely with that. WE WILL RETURN!"}
{"text":"Read about Chou's Kitchen from Travel & Leisure's \"Best Chinese Restaurants in the US\".  Had to give it a try!  Needless to say, my expectations were high.  The food at Chou's is pretty good, but I wasn't blown away.  Dumplings are handmade, which is a nice touch for sure.  You can't go wrong ordering these.  You won't get any sauce with it - just mix your own soy sauce with a touch of vinegar and spice.  I'll admit that I have had better dumpling elsewhere, but Chou's dumplings are pretty good for the Phoenix area.  Spicy beef and tendon dish (frequently recommended by other Yelpers) is good.  Could be spicer, but not bad.  I also ordered the meatball dish (known as Lion's head).  Nice flavor.  A little stingy on the number of meatballs though.  Service is slow, but then again, this can be expected from small mom and pop chinese restaurants.  Overall, this gets a 3.5 from me.  I'm not sure how it made Travel & Leisure's list, since it wasn't fantastic (though I've eaten at a few of the other restaurants on their list, and they can be hit-and-miss as well).  Still, a solid option.  Bump it up to 4-stars since I like to support local businesses."}
{"text":"First time here and the food was very good!  I had the #26 beef noodle plate.  Also had a glass of water which tasted like it was filtered unlike other places that use tap water. Will definitely be coming here again."}
{"text":"This place was delicious! The dumplings were the best I have ever had. We went with two small children and they were very accommodating! The beef pie was great as well. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Good delicious food. Service is somewhat slow but that's understandable because it gets pretty busy here! I would wait, for their food! :)"}
{"text":"it is a good restaurant, the food is very delicious. I remembered I ate  Bao zi there that was my first time to eat in Unite States, and extremely was amazed me a lot. Because it is real Chinese foods in a foreign country. I must recommend it."}
{"text":"God, this place is amazing! They are always busy and always have tons of Chinese people there.  The orange chicken is the best I've ever had. We always get the pork potstickers, beef stir fry noodles, orange chicken, and chicken fried rice. This is seriously the best Chinese food you'll find in the east valley."}
{"text":"Great authentic chinese food. Beef noodle soup and dumpling are amazing. Service was great as well."}
{"text":"It was alright, not great. Maybe it depends on what you order but I found everything (fried rice, wanton soup, egg rolls, Sichuan beef) pretty bland and a little greasy. Seemed like your standard americanized Chinese place, so I can understand why it's so popular. I prefer the freshness of mandarin style Chinese food. I might return but it won't be my first choice."}
{"text":"Always a favorite, I've never had the pleasure of eating in until now. I always had to order to go as I find myself more often in Tucson. I had a little more time this trip, so I decided to enjoy it.  This place never disappoints. Authentic Chinese cuisine to the heart, and some of the best Szechuan dishes I've ever had. True \"ma\" spice and flavor. I highly suggest the Szechuan fish, as it is a staple favorite of mine. I always get one to go. Never hesitate to come into this place.   Service is great, atmosphere is friendly, and the place is clean. Combined with fantastic food, this place easily gets 5 stars from me. If you're ever unsure as to what to order, feel free to ask the staff for recommendations. They won't steer you wrong. Happy eating!"}
{"text":"I often come to this place with my Chinese friends. Foods are great! But sanitation is somehow scary. I can literally see the insects hanging on the table. Other than that this place is good!"}
{"text":"I hadn't found a Chinese restaurant I liked until I went to Chou's Kitchen today for lunch.  My friend and I had the Pork and Green Beens which to be honest didn't look very appetizing to me, but was delicious!  We ate the whole bowl even after being full from the dumplings."}
{"text":"Not great food and dirty place! By the reviews I expected better food. Tried the spicy Mongolian beef, not a bit of spice and tasted like 5 spice seasoning. Poor unsanitary staff working too, coughing and more around food and touching silverware without washing hands! Yuck! I wanted to walk out, but we had ordered already. Won't be back!!"}
{"text":"Chou's Kitchen is a different place to eat. Only good handmade food that pleasures the palate, inteligence and pocketbook. Again, TIGER salad is a necessity for me but this time accompanied by: sweet n sour soup, eggplant n potatoes, pork steam dumpling, egg n leek turnover's and tea to finish! Nice..., hope you like it too!"}
{"text":"Finally found a place with authentic Chinese cuisine! Everyone has to try the pork dumplings, best in AZ."}
{"text":"Yaaaass! This place is great! It really scratches the xiao long bao itch that I get when craving Din Tai Fung.  Instead of driving to LA, I can get some decent XLB here! Shared a bunch of plates with the crew, family style. The Eggplant with Potatoes and Jalapeno is really good, so are the Beef Stew Noodle Soup and Braised Pork Rib. Also, there is a nearby boba place with a really awesome bear."}
{"text":"Great food, really good. Looking forward to trying more dishes, EXCEPT ordering it to go. The service was awful, my son and I sat with water for approximately ten minutes. A large Asian group walked in were seated and their order was taken immediately.  I wanted to get up and leave, but I was craving hot and sour soup. I have to admit that the food was great, but I have decided to not eat in ever again."}
{"text":"HEY YALL...because I have nothing to compare this spot with i think it's important to play it safe with 4 stars. I don't want YALL to think oooooo AP was way off the mark..anywho. . What I like best about this place was the variety of appetizers quantity that was small enough to order several of them and also the fact that they didn't I'll come out at the same time they give you time to enjoy what you have and then they bring out the rest one by one. This was the first time that I've ever had soup dumplings yeah yeah yeah I was in New York for a little while and never had the soup dumplings so I have nothing to compare them with but these right here were delicious ( tip you have to eat them while they're hot ) . I also had the sticky buns not what I'm used to they pan fry them also the taste was okay the meat inside was pork and very tasty but so little was given as far as the stuffing and goes. Lastly I tried the scallion pancakes and I wish I hadn't I know it was my first time trying these but I'm sure they're supposed to taste like something. Oh yeah I also ordered the beef meat pies the people have been raving about unfortunately I didn't get the opportunity to try them because they were raw in the inside lucky for me I always open up inspect my food before I eat it. Will I come back again maybe..... Oh yeah I remember you guys my 4 rating its for the soup dumpling and the wonderful customer service."}
{"text":"I loved the spicy chicken .... You MUST try IT!!!!   Juicy pork dumpling tasted little weird to me (bit too sweet )The server were friendly but I felt like they were rushing  . Overall, it was ok !!!"}
{"text":"This is my second trip to this restaurant. My experience this time is way different than the first time. Service is extremely slow. Im sitting here for about 20 minutes and not one person has come to take my order yet. It seems to me that you need to know someone here to be served at. There are some families coming after me and they already have their food at the table and it's about 30 minutes that I'm waiting now. The devote of the restaurant is very simple. The place is very small. I am waiting to see how the food is and will give my final rating after eating some food. If you come To this place, make sure to come with some full stomach and tons of patience. I will not recommend this place for their service"}
{"text":"I ordered for carry out. When I opened it up it looked awful. It looked like no other Chinese food Ive ever had. I ordered sweet and sour pork but it was cold, pressed chewy chicken that was flat and rubbery. I ordered pot stickers and they were disgusting, rubbery, and burned on the bottom. The filling just plopped right out of them. I also ordered chow mein and fried rice. The rice was white in color with no flavor. The chow mein was cold and gross. When I walked in, the patrons eating were Asian. I figured this is a very good sign. But it truly was below sub par food. I really wish I could get my $32 back. Very disappointing!!!!!"}
{"text":"This review for their highly ethnic Chinese dumpling only.  This type food  is prominently served in the North-Eastern part of China. Their version is the exact replica as it is served in China. I personally like it; However, some may find it  \"blend,\" each to their own.  The place is small, a hole in the wall, Mom and pop set up.  The atmosphere is more like a large family gathering where most people know each other, Formal service; like waiter and waitress pampering you with attention is lacking. This is not a place you would want to impress your date. However, If you like ethnic specialty food. This is the place."}
{"text":"We had the Beef Pie, Pork Pie, Pan Fried Chives Pocket, Spicy Beef and Tendon, Spicy Bean Curd and all were very tasty.  The noodles in the Soybean Paste and Beef Noodles were very authentic, al dente, paste and beef pretty good as well.  Seeing the owners hand rolling dumpling wrappers and making dumplings was very DTFish.  We need to support the mom and pops taking pride in their cooking and business.  Being from LA, not sure if this is the best in Chandler/Phoenix but there's not a lot of room for improvement.  2 chopsticks up."}
{"text":"Waiting forever??????????? Ordered 3 dishes, but we waited for at least 1 hour , only 2 dishes were served and one of them was almost cold. Worst experience ever."}
{"text":"I first heard about this place from a co worker. The best dumplings in town. It looks like a small little place tucked in a corner. The place is well run. The food is so good. The dumplings are delish. The wonton soup is like the best broth I have ever had. It's like I wish I was sick so I can eat this cause it taste so good.   We got the pork pies which were juicy. We had the green onion pancakes which are light and tasty and light taste of green onions. The soup dumplings were my favs. Sucking the broth out and then eating the dumpling.   The Chinese food is great as well. The fried was good and the sweet and sour chicken was crunchy and tasty."}
{"text":"Finding good Chinese food in the valley can be challenging, but I am very glad I found this place. I ordered the the beef buns and the beef pie, both were amazing, the texture of the buns were incredible, the flavor of the beef was really good. My friend got the Mongolian beef, when I tired it, I was jealous of him, the beef was so tender the sauce had the right amount of spicy in it, one the best Chinese dishes I ever had.  I recommend this place to any one who wants to get Chinese food. After eating there it easily became my favorite Chinese food in the valley"}
{"text":"Great stuff!! Buns were exceptional...very fresh. Watch dumplings being made while you wait. Two thumbs up only down side is bare bones atmosphere and no liquor license otherwise it's fantastic."}
{"text":"I love dumplings and this place has my ultimate favorite - Xiao Ling Bao!  This wasn't doughy and mushy like others places.  With your first bite you can taste the soup layer between the wrapper and meat filling.  OMG it was yummy!  We had the shrimp dumplings, potstickers and beef Bao.  The dumplings and potstickers were good.  I wasn't a fan of the Bao - the ratio was more bun than meat.  It's a trek for me but next time I am on the East side I will definitely make a special trip.  Besides where can you go in the valley and watch them make dumplings while you eat?  LOL"}
{"text":"Maybe it's because I live in places with really good chinese food (CA), but damn this place is terrible. Every dish I ordered was way too oily and bland. I even waited for my noodles for 15-20 min and when I finally asked where it is, they forgot I even ordered it. Lesson learned: take yelp reviews w/ a grain of salt."}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Gets little love though it should be on everyone's map. Great dishes we are not always accustomed to seeing. Great people. Always willing to help you out. Fast service even when it is busy. One of my favorites in the valley!"}
{"text":"The food here is rather decent Northern Chinese style. Their beef/pork pancake, fried leek dumplings are quite authentic as I originally was from that part of the region in China. Service are exceptional from the manager if you happen to speak mandarin. Decent portion and reasonable price. We almost visit them once a week even I live in Glendale which is around 1 hour's drive to Tempe."}
{"text":"The worst Chinese food you can possibly have, the soy paste noodle, the paste was not black and traditionally has always been black in fact their picture in the menu is black, but when you get it is brown looks like poop. they put ham in that that is never been done and it's done because it was cheap, again the picture does not display the same output, the sea food soup was tons of imitation crab meat, one piece of old per  cooked shrimp and calamari. there was no service at all. will not go back and please to all you America people out there, just want you guys to know, the Chinese does not eat like that, places like that give the Chinese restaurants a bad name"}
{"text":"Fantastic dumplings. Tried ones with pork and napa cabbage and steamed juicy pork.  -1 star as one other time my favorite Shao Long Bao were served to me without soup inside (the key differentiation for \"juicy\") and she didn't really care when i complained (no replacement, reimbursement nor anything)"}
{"text":"After hearing about this place from a friend then finding it on Yelp, had to give it a try. I had the steamed dumplings and the flat tofu with green peppers. Very good and clean. I will definitely be going back since this is the best Chinese food I have had in a while. Lunch price wasn't bad either. The ladies working there were very friendly and attentive. I was with a some friends visiting from China and they said that it was some of the best Chinese food they have had in the south east valley area.  Give this place a try, I don't want to see this one going away like many of the others. I will definitely be going back often."}
{"text":"The realest Chinese food in Arizona yet.  Real Chinese people eat here, it's not westernized.  Expect to hear people speaking mandarin and to be confused about everything if you're unfamiliar with authentic Chinese food.  Get the xiao long bao, onion pancake, and mackerel dumplings.  Don't go and try to order orange chicken or general tso's"}
{"text":"My search for a good Chinese restaurant has ended with the Best Chinese restaurant. I was very excited to see the place almost packed with Asians; that is a good sign. We immediately ordered the beef pies and the pork & Napa cabbage dumplings. You know these are made fresh because you can see them making them through a glass window and they don't arrive at the table right away like at other places. The beef is lightly seasoned and is great when you add the vinegar or hot sauce on the table.   The kung pao and mongolian beef dishes were excellent. Fresh vegetables and stir fried tender beef and chicken are the stars. They are not drowning in sickly, sweet sauces like you would find at other Chinese restaurants. I also liked the chicken and mushrooms, mainly for the broth, but this wasn't my favorite, maybe because it was all brown and you have to fuss with the small chicken bones.  Overall, very nice. Finally, I can agree with the Best of Phoenix, and Travel & Leisure was spot on with their assessment."}
{"text":"Waited an hour for food.  Dishes were served 20 minutes apart from each other.  Taste of food was not too good.  Beans, potatoes and rib clay pot not a good dish at all.  Service was average for a Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Very clean and good customer service. Food is very well done. The Sichuan Spicy Beef was done properly, most restaurants when flash frying the beef end up making the meat either too soggy or hard as a rock. The breading on the beef was light and was done right the first time. The appetizer, the Spicy Beef Tendon was delicious and very authentic to Sichuan standards.   You can ask for the house vegetables that they have available we ordered A Choy with a cook of garlic wok style. The bean curd with shredded pork and Chinese celery was done well and seasoned.   Would like to try other dishes on the menu, however, would definitely order the Sichuan Beef and Tendon dish again!"}
{"text":"The Tempe store carries on the good food quality of the original store, with a newer interior touch. Soup dumplings(aka xiao long bao) are awesome. They also did a good job on some rare to find dishes, such as chilies fried intestines. If you are an adventurous foodie, don't miss it."}
{"text":"I have been here quite a few times. They have recently renovated the places and it looks much better. The food, I have always found to be great! It is not your normal chines fast food. It seems more authentic and flavorful. There buns and dumplings are amazing. I love hot and spicy food so I asked the chef for spicy beef. It was crispy, fried and delicious with Jalapenos and red chillies...mouth watering!. All in all, I see myself going there for years to come!"}
{"text":"Warning, don't get deterred that there aren't any seats for you when you walk in... that's a good sign that the the tables are full with everyone stuffing their faces.  I waited for about 15 minutes for a table to free up, and I'm glad I did.  It was kind of a chilly night and I was feeling for something hot.  I decided on the seafood noodle soup and pork pies.  The noodles soup broth was lightly seasoned with a hint of white pepper (just the way I like it), the noodles were thick and hearty, and the portion was substantial.  The pork pies (3) were like a flattened pot sticker that had been pan-fried on both sides, Yum!  Definitely, a place serving up genuine Chinese food with the finesse of a home-cooked meal. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Love Chou's Kitchen! This place has the best Chinese food. You can tell from the moment you walk in their food is great home cooking. They are making fresh dumplings as you walk in and the family that owns the restaurant is always kind and welcoming.  The owners really make an effort to get to know their customers. Every time we go they ask how I'm doing and about my family. They even remember that I like extra sauce and toss some extra in with our order.  But the fabulous service isn't the only reason my husband and I love going to Chou's the food is fantastic! Dumplings are handmade, juicy and packed with flavor. The meat in their beef pie is seasoned to perfection and the dough is soft in the center and perfectly crunchy on the outside. I also highly recommend their green onion pancakes.  It's a great appetizer, with tasty scallions and they always serve the perfect portion. Last but not least their main course of Mongolian beef is out of this world good. Marinated and tender beef is served with a zesty brown sauce over rice. It's incredibly hard not to eat this dish in one serving but it makes for wonderful leftovers. Go to Chou's Kitchen once and you'll never want to go anywhere else for your Chinese food!"}
{"text":"Their xiao long bao (steamed soup dumplings) are delicious. This location closes at 3pm to 4:30pm daily."}
{"text":"This is not a place for vegetarians. Although they do have a few options. The disappointment for us was, we specifically mentioned no meat in our meal ( we ordered a vegetarian dish) , there were meat pieces in our dish. I have no complaints about fewer vegetarian options. But, when asked for a specific request, the kitchen must ensure that it is taken care of."}
{"text":"The service was absolutely terrible. It took 15 minutes to even get menus, we received our food, apps, THEN waters.  The server never came back, then practically had to throw my debit card at the her to pay my bill. I got the orange chicken which was so over cooked I couldn't even chew it, I tried to mix it with the steamed rice that was cold and all clumped together. Was 10000000% displeased and would not recommend. I don't know how this place won awards."}
{"text":"I don't really like Chinese food but this place changed my mind. I loved the food here especially the steak noodle dinner! I'm glad I came by with my family, I'll be here more often"}
{"text":"We came in for the juicy pork dumplings. We were not disappointed. We made a pleasant discovery of their cumin calamari."}
{"text":"Always my favorite place. Come here almost every week. Their food is real north china Chinese food. Same as my hometown flavor. The service is great. The stir fry pork neck bones and minced pork with vermicelli are my most favorite :)"}
{"text":"A friend and I recently discovered this gem! Authentic Chinese cuisine! Huge fan and definitely recommend this place! Lots of variety for every taste and super reasonable pricing.    ( Fish pot in chili oil w white rice, Veggie Lo Mein & Sea food dumplings)"}
{"text":"I had to come here once again before I moved out of town. I ordered two of the juicy pork buns and it was heavenly. Nothing beats homemade juicy pork buns-the taste was amazing. The staff was quick and efficient too. I've had other dishes here-go with the eggplant with pork-you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I looooove their xiao long bao (pork soup dumpling). This place is the only one which I know have them. The pricing isn't too expensive for it either, $9 for about 10. Also I really like the pig ears as the cold dishes ($6),it goes really well with steamed rice. Haven't tried too much of their menu though."}
{"text":"The one star is for hot food and relatively good service.  After seeing the review in Travel and Leisure and the favorable reviews on this site AND the fact that it is located in Chandler, we ran over tonight.  Ordered the scallion pancake--where were the scallions?  Ordered the beloved beef pies and pork dumplings--eh, so, so. Ordered the eggplant, jalepeno, and potato dish, spicy szechuan chicken, and beef stir fry noodles.  Without exception, each dish was bland and greasy and tasted pretty much the same.  The table was sticky.  One of the best Chinese restaurants in the country--I don't think so!  What a waste of calories and time!!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and the food is always fresh and tasty.  I am Chinese from northern China.   This is authentic northern Chinese cuisine.  Food is not fancy but extremely delicious and satisfying.  Highly recommend the Zha Jiang noodles (meat sauce with hand made noodles), the chives and egg pocket, and dumplings.  Good prices and comforting home made Chinese food.  Owners are very nice."}
{"text":"The place is hidden in a strip mall. It does not look like much. But the food is tasty and authentic. Recommend it highly."}
{"text":"This has long been my favorite restaurant in the valley but it has slipped in my rankings.  I feel the need to update my review for two reasons.  1. The prices have gone up significantly since I started going here, and I have seen a higher percentage of Caucasians since then. The food is still fantastic, but no longer an unbelievable deal.   2. In my last trip, a cockroach was floating in the water I drank out of, which shook me up and disappointed me deeply. They brought new bottled water, and showed that they had just sprayed for bugs a few days ago, which often brings a few out. However they did not offer any further recompense beyond the bottled water for this incident.   I am much less enamored of this place than I was before. I may come back, but probably not soon or often, sadly."}
{"text":"Amazing dumplings! Everything else I have tried was very good too.  Staff is very nice."}
{"text":"I am excited about this place, even though I have not had many opps to try northern style Chinese food.  Think dough, and don't mistakenly believe it's the same dough steam/cooked/fried/stuffed in different ways.   The kind owner lady proudly told me each of our 3 dishes was made w/ a unique dough recipe...   At first I was worried all the dough would overpower my tastebuds, until I asked for some dipping sauce... they kindly made me a black vinegar, ginger, and scallion sauce... that just upleveled everything.  Who knows if it's traditional or not, but I implored the owner to start dishing this out when Americans like me (smiley face) come over and eat.  The off-menu items are written on a small whiteboard sitting atop the freezer stuffed w/ to-go dumplings... luckily the folks there speak English, so I'll be working my way thru this secret menu and who knows.. this might go 5 stars!  SW corner of Ray and Alma School, next to the JCC."}
{"text":"Very good, authentic Chinese food served by eager and attentive staff.  Unique and fresh dumplings made the meal a special treat.  One warning:  dishes are served as they come out of the kitchen so best to share food."}
{"text":"First of all, i have to admit the food is really good there. The problem is the old-lady waitress. Her poker face looks like i owe her money, but that's not the problem. She changed our table and took our dishes to another one even without asking our permission, and her words were just like an order rather than negotiation. Anyway, again, fabulous food but horrible service if you're \"lucky\" enough to meet that waitress."}
{"text":"I got the pork dumplings; my wife got the kung pow chicken. We both ate, then came home and had almost immediate diarrhea. I think we can go ahead and safely check this place off of our list."}
{"text":"So we went here on a whim. I love Chinese food.  The hot and sour soup was just hot. And by hot I mean burn your mouth like crazy. Everything we had barely had any flavor.  I was so excited to try this place but was very disappointed. Why kind of Chinese place doesn't have egg rolls...?"}
{"text":"I am an Asian myself and very picky about Chinese food.  This place definitely earns my vote for being my favor place for Northern Style Chinese food.  Love the dumpling, pancakes, desert dishes and etc.  They do offer some \"southern\" style Chinese food which I am NOT very fond about.  The owner is always very nice to me and my family.  We go there often and always have a great dinner there."}
{"text":"This place would have had 5 stars if the service was better. Boy, the service could really use a lot of improvement. The waiters don't make eye contact, they get very awkward, and you have to chase them down for items. They need a lot of training.  Okay, the good!  The dumplings were delicious! I mean, juicy, squirt in your mouth amazing dumplings. (That came out dirty...but they're really good) Mongolian beef was tender had more meat than onions, which is always a plus! Stir fry noodles had really good flavor and the shrimp was cooked well.  I had watermelon juice which was refreshing and not too sweet. The soda comes in a can, which I'm assuming means no refills.   Next time I come, it will probably be for take out."}
{"text":"So Good! Thanks to Yelp I found this hidden gem right by my house. It is located in a sketchy strip mall in Chandler. We went in on a Sunday for dinner and we were the only non-asian people in the whole place (Great sign!!). We were quickly greeted and our drink order was taken. There were ladies making fresh dumplings right at the counter. We HAD to order some! We started with the Hot and Sour soup. I was one of the best I have ever had! It was filled with tons of veggies, tofu and egg. It had a great kick and tons of flavor. We also ordered those fresh dumplings, we chose the pork,shrimp and chive variety. They were amazing!! Our server mixed up a special sauce for dipping that was really tasty. After reading previous reviews we also got an order of the beef pies. The arrived screaming hot (let them cool a bit). One bite into the chewy dough and the rush of broth and tender meat enters your pie hole (pun intended) you are going to be very happy. The meat was so tender and flavorful. We really wanted to order some noodles, they make them fresh in house, but we were so full they are going to have to wait until a return trip which I see happening in the very near future. Go here, support these great people and enjoy amazing food!!"}
{"text":"Food taste okay but Greasy. Service can also be very slow, very poor. Dining room was dirty, not cleaned.  An insight tip from previous kitchen help...Xiao Long Bao was NOT homemade.  It's frozen products that they purchased from the Mekong Supermarket.  However, they do make their steam dumplings and pan fried buns there."}
{"text":"I loved everything we had and can't wait to try everything else! The service is slow, but everything was made to order. The soup dumplings were amazing. We will be back again and again."}
{"text":"What can I say this place is awesome! I am Chinese and every time I come here it feels like Home. Great food, great service, great atmosphere"}
{"text":"Best family style cooking. Fresh high quality ingredients. Definitely our regular stops for Chinese home style food."}
{"text":"I was pretty disappointed with food.  I was guilty of believing the hype off of Yelp reviews.  I was looking forward to more big city, Cantonese or Shanghai style place.  It is not.  More of a comfort food sort of presentation.  We ate this fresh veggie salad with home made noodles.  It had a strange after taste that I could not determine the ingredient.  The flat beef dumpling was a little tasteless.  The stir fried green beans was decent.  The regular dumplings were average.  The strange taste from the veggie was the deal breaker.  The service was fast and nice.  This place needs to make adjustments."}
{"text":"Have been searching for great Chinese food since we left the east coast......  2.5 years later we have found Chou's Kitchen.... #foodbliss"}
{"text":"This place is the best. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Plus it's cheep for the amount of food you get. The only bad is they are closed on Wednesday and they close at 9pm everyday. I give this place 5 stars easy. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"the WORST service EVER!!! I was never greeted at the door I was left standing there for a out 5 mins like an idiot. so I sat myself since there was no sign that says *please wait to be seated* ...  I tried to make eye contact with any of the servers ... no luck.. I saw one of the girls checking her phone and attending to other customers...  getting agitated at this point I waved my hand and said *excuse me get I get a menu*  finally ! I ordered the steamed dumplings with the 1st waiter and said I'll think of what to order later but for now I'll start off with the dumplings.... she took my order and never came back I made my final order with another server  there were 2 college girls who came in way after me sitting next to me who ordered the same dumplings ... they got theirs before me ...  finally I get all my food, before I was finished the server  (mind u no one has ever stopped by if everything was OK or if I needed anything) gives me a check and says thank u ... WTF of course I give the check back to the server and said I wanted to make another order to go ...  the end   so ratings on the food ... not impressed 2 at most out of 5 the *soup* dumpling #120 on the menu had little to almost almost no soup .. the dumplings itself very small, flavor of the dumplings good 5 out of 5 for taste   mapo tofu not bad 3 out of 5   restaurant itself very clean   would I come back? maybe not to dine in.. I'll probably take it to go ..."}
{"text":"This place is another gem of mine when I need my Asian food fixture. I love their thick green onion pancake since they make it crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Highly recommend grabbing the   green onion pancake as an appetizer. Their beef bun is also delicious the way they stuff it and pan fry the bun- another must try. I also tried their beef noodle soup which I wasn't very impressed by. I like to think you can gauge how good a Chinese restaurant is based on their beef noodle soup since it the bread-and-butter of most Chinese restaurants. However I think where Chou's kitchen shines is in their handmade buns and dumplings."}
{"text":"This restaurant is only a mile from our house and I couldn't believe we didn't know about it. The server told us that they have been there for about a year. My husband is a fan of Chinese food. He was very sad when his favorite restaurant Wong's place had a change of new ownership. It was hard to find a good and decent Chinese place to diner out. I am glad that our friends dragged us out last Sunday night to try this place and it was fantastic. I would give five star for food, but the service fell a little short so I settle for four stars. We would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"We had the eggplant with jalapeno (actually the peppers were milder), cold noodles with cucumber, pork buns, and pork pot stickers.  The pot stickers were a bit on the doughy side and not too flavorful.  The other three dishes were fantastic.  There are many things on the menu that one does not normally see in Chinese restaurants, and I look forward to returning soon to try some of them.  For the price, it does not get much better."}
{"text":"It's never a good thing when you have to update a review and lower the rating.  Here's what went down.   We arrived about 6:30 PM and no tables were available which is not unusual for a Saturday night.  We waited about 10 minutes and got a table.  Good.  We placed our order and waited for our food.... and waited, and waited and waited and waited and... and... and... and... and... and.... waited.    It was past 7:30 PM before we got our food.  Several times during the wait I asked hubby if he wanted to leave and try someplace else.  There are many, many asian restaurants in the area so finding a place would not have been difficult.  Hubby felt that because we had already ordered the food that the owner would be stuck with our order and therefore did not want to leave.  In retrospect, we should have asked if they started cooking our food and if they had not,  we should have left.   The orange chicken was average.  The onion pancakes were good/not greasy. The chicken fried rice was acceptable; they make it better at our local takeout.   The salt and pepper shrimp was just ok. I had to do a song and a dance when I asked them to put ginger on the shrimp.  The waitress had to go twice to the kitchen to ask the chef about putting ginger on my shrimp.  They acted like it was an exotic item that had never been used in Chinese cooking-- you should have seen their faces of angst.  It got really annoying having a three way conference about putting a few sticks of ginger in my food.  Ridiculous.   This was not a stellar display of food for the amount of time and money spent. The owner dropped by our table to apologize for the delay but nevertheless our weekly outing was ruined.  Not enjoyable AT ALL.  It was a stressful time waiting for food that never seemed to arrive as well as having to negotiate for a few sticks of ginger in my food.    An evening out is supposed to a fun time with delicious food.  This was neither."}
{"text":"This was my first time here if it's busy you won't get any attention at all and also I was just trying to place an order to go the first waitress said if you have any questions please ask and as I was about to she pointed to another waitress and said just ask her so I did and she said it would take 30min to order so I said ok I'll order and come back and then another lady behind the counter told her it was going to be like an hour as if they dint want to take another order (she even pointed at all the orders and was like see it's going to be a long wait). even thought it was only 8pm on Sunday and close at 10pm so this was my first and last experience here....."}
{"text":"Visited 6/15/13  A little hole in the wall that I wish were closer to home!!    The menu offers a nice selection of what I would consider more authentic food. Not what I would consider the typical \"Americanized\" dishes.   Ordered the Green Onion Pancakes and Steamed Pork Dumplings.  Both were very good. We found the pancakes to be a little light in flavor. But when I ate them with my main dish, it made a nice balance.   I had the Cumin Lamb.  Very tasty with a nice spice.  Was very rich in flavor which filled me very quickly.  Again, the pancakes when nicely with this dish.    Girlfriend had the Stir-Fry Pork Neck Bones.  A large plate of falling off the bone pork bones.  This dish really needed some vegetables to balance the heavy flavor and fill of the pork bones.  You do have to work to get the meat off the bone a little. Small bones with small meat, but it was worth the taste.   I was most impressed with the Handmade Appetizer menu.  There were many things that I want to try from this list. I could probably make a meal just from this part of the menu.  I would also like to try the different soups.   Overall, this is a very good Chinese restaurant. Although they do offer the more typical selections, try something a little different!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went for dinner last week our first time at Chou's... I read the reviews and thought it would be good.... we were disappointed.... my broccoli and beef had absolutely very little sauce,  it was so dry.... My husband ordered a chicken and vegetable entree, he said it was just okay, a little dry.... Our potstickers came again no sauce....???? We heard people at the next table asking for sauce , the waitress said, no they didn't have sauce of any kind....all they had was this soy sauce sitting on the table....  But we ordered the Beef Pie appetizer.... it was wonderful , also comes pork.... They were juicy and very flavorful.... so if you have a taste for Beef Pies (3 to an order) this is the place for you...."}
{"text":"First time at Chou's - won't be my last.  Definitely need to come back and explore the menu!  Had the Cumin Lamb and the Juicy Pork Dumplings (AKA Soup Dumplings) - delicious!   No atmosphere, and the customers waiting for take-out tend to stand over the top of your table.  But, that's not the point at Chou's, it's the food.  Chou's is looking to be the best Chinese food I've had lately outside of Chinatown Chicago."}
{"text":"Cool place! I'm not much of a fan of run-of-the-mill American-style Chinese food, and for a couple years now, the only Chinese place I've regularly gone to has been a great Szechuan place in south Tempe. Chou's is a rather different style of Chinese food (mainly from northern China, I believe), but I liked it just as much and have added it to my list of go-to places. One big plus for me is that you can get several relatively small, inexpensive dishes and eat family-style, trying lots of different things. The pancakes and dumplings are great. I got a spicy chicken entree, which was also delicious. So many more things on the menu I still want to try..."}
{"text":"Found this place after reading a review in our local newspaper......Yummy.... I'm finally happy to find a place that makes pot-stickers and dumplings like my Grandmother. Just wished we lived closer. Even our picky 9 year old loved the food. Definitely authentic."}
{"text":"My brother suggested this place when we were trying to decide on where to go to dinner with my family. We came here on a Sunday night and it was conveniently open until 10 pm...super nice since a lot of Asian places close early. We ordered a lot of food and they were all pretty good... my favorite was the Juicy Pork Dumpling...basically a soup dumpling...I love DTF in LA and Seattle which made me love XLB and this was pretty good to me in AZ...haven't tried other places that might have this...so everytime I crave soup dumplings I would know where to go. I could probably eat a whole serving (10 pieces) on my own. We have ordered beef pie, orange chicken, sweet and sour pork, beef fried rice, and house noodles. Everything was good, just a tad bit salty. They do have really good milk tea. Service was pretty good. It has been pretty busy here both times we went, but luckily we get seated right away. Would come back for a good value and good food for sure."}
{"text":"Fantastic Chinese food! Real, authentic and delicious!! Northern style foods here which is rare for a Chinese restaurant in the USA. They had make their dumplings and they are delicious! Inexpensive and amazing? I don't know what else to say. Oh yes I do! Get their pancakes with chives! Absolutely amazing! They provide chopsticks on the table and soup spoons if you want western silverware such as a fork make sure to ask in advance. They wont bring it out automatically which I am fine with but the beef pies I also ordered I think are best eaten with a fork! Very juicy!"}
{"text":"I wasn't too crazy about Chou's service when I came. I was seated in the back corner and felt invisible to the waitresses. I waved them down a few times to try to place my order. After telling me they'll be with me shortly, they would go on to other tables who arrived well after me. The beef pies had a great flavor, but grease was oozing out. The chicken in the warm pot had small brittle bones that were hard to separate from the meat. It was very tedious to eat although it was covered in a tasty sauce. The chicken was also a little dry. I can tell that the steamed dumplings were freshly made, but it didn't come with fresh sauce to dip them in. I used the hot chili oil mixed with black vinegar that was on the table. From the positive Yelp reviews here, I really wished I would've had a better experience here but left very disappointed and will not return."}
{"text":"Authentic chinese food. The restaurant is small, so on weekends you have to wait a little bit. I bought several dishes, including the steam dumpling. I am not too impress with the steam dumpling."}
{"text":"This place is great. Everything I ordered was great, but the pork dumplings are amazing! I've had a lot of pork dumplings in my life and these are some of the best I've had."}
{"text":"This is the second opening of the restaurant - the original is in chandler. There are some items that aren't featured here. The most notable item from the other location is the Lamb skewers - it's kind of unfortunate that they don't have it at this location as it's one of my favorites.  I usually get their ??? (eggplant, potato, and jalapeño) and their beef pies. Their xiaolongbaos can be a hit or miss sometimes. There were times when they over cooked so the wrapping is a bit saggy (lack of a better word). Overall, the portion size is reasonable, but the price is also on the higher end.   Location itself is not bad - easy access to parking, close to ASU, and there are boba places around if you're looking for after lunch/dinner dessert. Service isn't bad when you know mandarin."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food we've had in awhile here in the Tempe area. Great prices."}
{"text":"I don't understand why anyone would review this place unfavorably. This was my first visit here and the soup dumplings were just perfect and delightful. The Cumin Calamari was so pleasant and spicy, and unlike any calamari I've had ( except maybe a similar dish at wagamama). I'm looking forward to the next time I'm back on this side of town."}
{"text":"This place is brand spanking new, serving up the culinary delights of Northeast China/Manchuria. The meat patty in fried pastry is absolutely to die for. They come 3 in an order and I saw people order it for lunch and wolf down all three in one sitting. The pastry is pan fried and the meat is somehow miraculously bathed in a savory soup. When you take a bite, the soup gushes out and overwhelms you, very much XLB style (Xiao Lung Bao).   The dumplings, pot stickers, and hand pulled noodle soups are also quite good, as well as the noodle in the dark thick peanutty sauce.   The ladies working there are pleasant and friendly. The restaurant is commendable for its cleanliness.  This place totally rocks and I recommend you all flash mob this place to keep it alive and well, serving up goodies for years to come."}
{"text":"As others have mentioned, this place does have pretty authentic Chinese food (for the area, especially)! Would recommend."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food I've had in the valley so far! I've been reading reviews on Phx New Times and searching for good Chinese food. I'm  so tired of the really greasy warmed over weird meat overly salty Chinese food I've had in the valley. Chou's had really good reviews so we went to the one in Tempe.   There were a lot of Chinese families eating there so I took that as a Good sign the food will be pretty darn delicious and authentic.   We were seated promptly and ordered the beef pies, pork xiao long bao, won ton noodle soup, and beef chow mein. The beef pies are to die for! Savory, juicy, piping hot, and crispy yet soft! Wow these were good!   The won ton noodle soup was really yummy. You can tell they used a bone broth in the soup which adds more flavor overall. The pork xiao long bao came out hot, I waited for it to cool down and took a bite of these little pieces of heaven. They had a wonderful little meatball inside with delicious juice that explodes with flavor in your mouth! I had 8 of them before I had to call it quits. There's 10 total.   The beef chow mein was also really great! The noodles were perfectly al dente, the perfect amount of oil and sauce, and so much flavor! I'm already craving more. Don't hesitate to eat here!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but man was I disappointed. We went on Labor Day and before we head over my husband called to see if they were open since it was a holiday, the lady answered and said \"yes we are open\" and hung up. When we got there we were waved over to the counter so we could order our take out. The tallish girl taking our order looked miserable and angry. I asked about a menu item and what the dish contained and she literally just read the name of the dish off the menu and didn't tell me what else was in it. I asked if i could substitute white rice with brown rice and she just said \"no\". She was rude and just glared at us while we went over the menu and made us feel really uncomfortable. I ended up ordering chicken with noodles and they were super salty and the noodles had a weird synthetic taste. I had to throw it in a pan at home and added some sesame oil and other veggies and spices to make it decent enough to eat. If the food would've been good I would've returned but i won't return for bad service and bad food. Oh and I saw google reviews where a ton of people were complaining about the same girl I hope she reads them and fix's her attitude or gets a job where she'll be happy."}
{"text":"The spicy cold noodles and dumplings are just great. I'm Chinese and are usually very picky about Chinese Restaurant because I always thought they tasted too Americanalized everytime I tried it. However, this place is fatanstic. It's small but clean. The owner and workers there are very friendly. In my opinion, the flavor of the food tastes a lot better than a lot of Dim Sum places in Phonex, Arziona. I strongly recommend this place and you gotta try it out yourself."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times before but this time the dish I ordered was not made how I remembered. The soybean paste noodles just tasted weird overall. I had to mask the flavor with some spicy chicken dish. :/ For a night where I was hungry and tired, I ended with disappointment.  On the upside, my prior dining experiences I've ordered the meatball and glass noodles clay pot, green scallion pancake, and beef buns."}
{"text":"I have always been one of those guys that doesn't get Chinese food, because I feel like everything I find is Americanized, bland, and boring. Luckily, the group from PHXFoodNerds reported about Chou's Kitchen, and I decided to take a trip and see what Dongbei style, Northeastern Chinese food was like. I'm so glad I did!  Regional specialties like flat, clear, green bean noodles, crispy beef pies, stewed pork neck bones, spicy tiger salad and some of the best vegetable dishes I've ever had are on offer at Chou's. It's no wonder that this amazing regional menu that has caught on in local media and even recently garnered praise from Travel and Leisure Magazine as one of the best Chinese restaurants in the U.S! Chou's Kitchen is a true find in Arizona, and well worth a visit"}
{"text":"Alright Yelpers... you got my back.  I'm constantly on the lookout for legit Chinese cuisine in the AZ and you've yet to disappoint.  I brought the little one in hopes that it will cultrify her in the ways of the Chinese.  Also anything specializing in Northern Chinese cuisine in AZ was worth a try.  On first glance, it looked like a hole in the wall in a nondescript plaza.  Stepping in, I saw a lot of Chines people dining and that's always a good sign in the pursuit of authentic Chinese cuisine.  The waitress spoke minimal English and scored some major brownie points telling the little one how pretty she was.  The little princess preened.  Upon perusing the menu and from what I knew of Northern Chinese cuisine, I ordered accordingly.  Here's the breakdown:  Beef Pies Dumplings with Pork and Napa Cabbage Spicy Pig Intestine Stir Fry Soup Dumplings  Beef Pies - 4/5 What can I say?  I love me a good beefcake harhar~  This was legit like my grandmam used to make for me and pan fried goodness.  My only complaint is that the price to portion ratio is a little over the top.  Plus, it could've really used some scallions in the mixture to give it a deeper flavor profile.  Then again, I'm biased cuz my grandmam was the sh*t when it came to making these babies.  Dumplings with Pork and Napa Cabbage - 3.5/5 Okay... don't shoot.  I must say that the dough wrappers are definitely handmade from scratch and just the right consistency and texture.  These babies are cooked to perfection.  My problem lies in the filling being... well... bland.  Granted, Napa tends to play second fiddle to any protein, but it shouldn't be lost to the point where I'm like... is there even any Napa in here?  The dumplings really called for a strong sauce condiment, and I found myself craving the garlic chili soy sauce I make for myself at home...  yea... definitely needed that homemade crack sauce.  Who knows, I find myself wishing I had ordered the potstickers instead.  Spicy Pig Intestine Stir Fry - 5/5 Oh chitterlings... how I love thee... this was cooked so good.  If you like this sort of thing, this is a must order dish.  I bet all the other house specialties are as good as this one though... Will update once I've tried others.  Soup Dumplings - 5/5 Again, if you are looking for Din Tai Fung quality, go to Din Tai Fung.  For Northern Chinese cuisine, the skin on these babies were perfectly rolled and molded... and I have to admit... the filling was more flavorful then the actual Dumplings with Napa Cabbage I had ordered.  And this is a pure pork mixture.  Definitely a must-get.  Yum.  Overall, I'd come back to this joint and try out more of the other authentic dishes.  If you like legit Chinese food, this is a real treat.  Northern Chinese cuisine: noodles and dumplings.  That's their specialty so treat your taste buds special and get some.  Rating: Service - 4/5 Price - 3/5 Food - 4.5/5"}
{"text":"A hidden gem of Chinese cuisine in the Phoenix Metro area, Chou's Kitchen is by for some of the best authentic Chinese food I have tasted in the state of Arizona.   Looking at the menu can be a bit daunting but you can't go wrong with their Steam Juicy Pork Dumplings or Xiao Long Bao as they are called( Shau Long Bow would be the best way to describe the english phonetics)  or their sesame green onion pastry, pork rib noodle soup and so much more.  I definitely place this at the top of my favorite restaurants in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Different and authentic food that is worth a try. You might like it. Some of the offerings on the menu do not tickle my taste buds and I recognize many Chinese restaurants have \"Americanized\" their menus to attract the general populace. Service is outstanding. Menu has a wide variety of selections. Atmosphere is busy with a background of much Chinese being spoken. Tried the beef pie. Too bland for me. Tried the chicken noodle dish... ok, but also a little bland. I had to thoroughly douse it with chili sauce. Susan had the broccoli beef and enjoyed. This was our second visit. Maybe we need to try something else on the menu. Will probably think twice before returning. Maybe we just have to recognize that we really like the \"Americanized\" versions of Chinese food."}
{"text":"amen. there's finally a really great chinese restaurant near my house. i'm telling you, chandler is the secret gem of phoenix. anyway...my husband just picked out some food and brought it home. we had hot & sour soup, kund pao chicken, and what i think would be called lo mein. (soft noodles). oh man, oh man. everything was great but especially the noodles. these things were homemade."}
{"text":"I've only been once, to the Tempe location, but enjoyed it very much. Great juicy pork dumplings.  And beef meatballs (4 large) with bok choy. Very nice service and the 'call' button is nice. Big portions--this was plenty of food for 2 adults and a young child."}
{"text":"Too salty and slow service. You can wait for an hour for your dishes. The food got too much salt inside. You probably need a couple of bottle of water to get over it."}
{"text":"Excellent dumplings, good prices and friendly service. Everything was great except the (lack of) cleanliness. No paper towels in the bathroom (what do the staff dry their hands on?) and there was a German cockroach in our food. Yikes."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! This is the place for fresh and traditional Chinese noodles and dumplings. The beef stew noodle soup is the bomb. Pricing very reasonable."}
{"text":"I love this place.  My favorite dishes are the Steamed Juicy Pork Dumplings, the Eggplant with Minced Pork, and Garlic Sauce, and the Coriander Lamb.  Every time we've been here, the food is amazing.  The service is great, too!  The menu is extensive.  I need to branch out and try new things on the menu, but my favorites are just so good, I can't resist ordering them.  If you live closer to Tempe, try out their Apache Rd location.  I tried it out one night.  It was just as tasty as the original Chou's Kitchen in Chandler!"}
{"text":"Small place with marginal service but good food.  Had the Hot and Sour Soup. Not too hot or too sour.   Steamed dumplings. The filling was pork and bok choy. It was very light and tasty.  House Special Noodles.  Good flavor and large portion. Could have put in a couple more shrimp. But good food overall and reasonably priced. We will be back.  Andrew S is right on the money with his review. We sat in the exact same booth.   Also ordered a Coke and with the second one had to ask for more ice.  What is it with Chinese places and ice?  My wife ordered a diet coke and got diet Pepsi.  Not the same thing."}
{"text":"You really can't call yourself a chinese take-out connoisseur until you've had Chou's. Nestled in a desolate shopping plaza next to a questionably and continually empty thai(?) hole in the wall, Chou's continues to hit the mark with it's yummy chinese comfort food and specialties. Like you'd expect the menu is large. I haven't had most of it because I'm boring, well... not really, but I'm just one of those schmucks that gets the same thing every time. Every. Single. Time. I can't help it, I love the classics: pan-fried noodles veggies only, fried dumplings, and their specialty, BEEF PIE. Oh sweet, bovine goodness, marinated and fried to perfection. So good to my soul, so terrible to my waistline. Anywho, staff is reasonably friendly and they speak very poor english, but who cares. If you're dining in, it can be loud sometimes and make sure to clarify with your waiter/waitress what you are ordering, sometimes the menu can be a bit confusing. That pretty much it, happy eating!"}
{"text":"I love the Tempe one, but I feel like I get bad service from this one. The food is okay, and I had an incident where a roach ran across the table. Lol."}
{"text":"VERY Authentic Chinese food without the cost of going to China. Good food and the server was great. I'm still on the side of 'Americanized' Chinese food so I don't try everything they would have but what I did have was excellent. If you are in to authentic Americanized Chinese food I would absolutely go there. Even if you wanted to experiment a little they know how to recommend their food to us non-chinese folks. Great taste."}
{"text":"As a Chinese, I think it's the best Chinese restaurant ever in AZ where the dishes are very similar to the ones in China."}
{"text":"I always get one of the various fried rice dishes they offer here and it's unbeatable. So delicious!! I actually find myself craving it all the time. Also try the pork and cabbage dumplings! They're flavorful and they send out a large generous portion. Recommend!"}
{"text":"I've lived in China, and this place is totally legit. It's always filled with native Chinese people, so you know it's good. The owners are very friendly and the food is very delicious."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this. Not your typical salty and over seasoned Chinese food. Simple ingredients. Freshly prepared. Light but filling! Definitely the first of many trips to come."}
{"text":"I ordered the Orange Chicken...by far the most flavorful I have ever had! Served on a bed of lettuce with chunks of fresh orange, and a sauce to die for! White rice served on the side.  I'll be back here!"}
{"text":"When eating on a T&L rated restaurant, sometimes the expectations will get in the way of the eating experience that one forgets enjoyment on the eating itself, but alas I find that not to be overbearingly true with Chou's Kitchen.  So I walked in on this hole in the wall Chinese restaurant and there's this plain interior with cramped booth and tables, was promptly greeted, seated, and served water in those 70's hard plastic glass with a straw, then after looking at the menu, my order was taken and written on (get this) Chinese characters. I waited and all the time salivated as I could hear the clanging of pots and pans and could smell the distinctly Chinese aroma of spices and seasonings from the back kitchen, with the cooks seemingly enjoying a chat as well.   Then my appetizer of beef pie arrived, handwrapped and I would admit greasy, so I had to kind-a dry them with a paper napkin, but here's the good part, the beef filling was so flavorful I had to take a moment to really ignore the fat and the juices. For the main course, the stir fry chicken with garlic souce blew my mind, and made me an even ardent believer that there were really nuances in regional cooking, NorthEastern it is, while having them with rice, just a fine balance of spicy and plain flavors in the palate.  So what is the value of experience over expectations you may ask - it is that I really feel I am eating amazing Chinese food prepared by masterful Chinese cook on this gem of a place."}
{"text":"Spicy beef was great.  True Szechuan peppers make it a mouth tingling sensation.  Beef pies were really good.  As everyone else says, soup dumpling arent as good as \"the place whose name can't be said\"  but I don't love soup dumplings so it not a real issue.  My better half lives soup dumplings and these are good on days we don't want to drive back to SoCal."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The pan friend buns, pork dumplings and house noodles were incredible! The people who work here are sweet and humble and take great pride in their product. Ask for the special sauce for the dumplings, it takes them to the next level!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese in the city. Everything on the menu is amazing. Very fresh and friendly staff"}
{"text":"Found out about this place just last night (thanks fellow Yelpers,) and \"man\" do they have a thriving business!  If you're looking for a dining experience, this isn't the place. It's small.  A hole in the wall?  More life half a hole in the wall.  I went to get take-out and had a heck of a time not getting in the personal space of seated patrons - though everyone seemed happy and content. Feeling too close for comfort I made a hasty order of sweet and sour soup and Mongolian Beef due to the photos here on Yelp.  Just \"so-so\" on both.  What I should have done was taken the menu and stepped outside to see the full line-up.  After looking it over at home, I feel I got cheated (cheated myself) out of an \"experience.\"  Yep, I'm going back!"}
{"text":"Living in Peoria there aren't a lot of legit asian restaurants, I kind of gave up hope trying to find a decent one. Today while staying at my sisters home, my wife and I ventured into Chandler and found this gem. I bookmarked this spot many months ago, and I guess it just disappeared into the many restaurants that I wanted to try. After eating here once, I will literally drive an hour to eat at this restaurant when the craving arises, I had the beef fried noodles and my wife had the house special sweet & sour pork, we also split the juicy soup dumplings (#111.) After this meal, we knew this was going to be our new, go to Chinese restaurant when we're on this side of town. I can't wait to go back and try something new, something different."}
{"text":"Excellent Northern Style Chinese food, especially for Arizona. They make dumplings on the spot and you can purchase them frozen too if you really like them. If you're going in here for the first time, you may notice the abundance of Chinese people eating, which really speaks for itself.  For American people wanting to give this place a go, you could go for the standard Fried Rice with Kung Pao Chicken or something, or you can try some honest to goodness Northern Chinese cuisine. My recommendations for you would be the Beef Pies as a side dish if you're looking for something hearty and delicious as they're authentic Chinese street food.  Dumplings are quite good and obviously fresh. Their potstickers are decent too but they use their thick-skinned dumplings to make them, whereas I'm more used to potstickers with thinner skin. The potstickers also come with a lot of crust and served upside down.  Other noteworthy things are the Beef Noodle Soup. This place has the best Beef Noodle in town though quality consistency remains an issue. I've had Beef Noodle bowls that have been excellent and other times with the soup lukewarm and and an obviously diluted broth.   Reading some other reviews, I just want to clarify for others: XLB = Xiao Long Bao, which are basically small dumplings with soup inside them and are very good. They're usually a bit small and eating them will give you the dumpling skin, meat and soup all in one bite.   Service is good, and it's a small, tight knit group every time. Food does take a while though especially if it's busy. I've had waits from 20-30 minutes easily, so if you're in a hurry, call early.  Finally, a cool tip to share: something that's not well known is that they have a Lunch program for working Chinese people. People at Intel for example, have a person that gets a Bian Dang (Lunchbox) order from a bunch of people and drives over to Chou's Kitchen. They pick up all the lunchboxes and bring them to Intel to split to the workers. This is for people that really love their Chinese lunchboxes and I'm pretty sure they could serve one to you if you asked for it. I don't know how much it costs but it definitely exists.  Overall, this place while excellent for Arizona, if you're comparing to the real good stuff in Taiwan or China, it'll be more average for you."}
{"text":"Very good dumplings fried rice good too. Service at lunch was just fine. Definitely going back to see if they have off menu dishes."}
{"text":"So where to begin. It's a small place that's your typical hole in the wall setting, but clean. Pictures hung on the walls provides some ideas of what the dishes look like. Those of you that are used to Panda Express, PF Chang, or your typical American Chinese food or whatever New York Chinese food are, you won't find anything familiar. This is a place that specializes in northern Chinese food. This means noodles, dumplings, buns, and lots of wheat based products. The place should get an extra star for not having beef and broccoli on their menu. I mean seriously there is no broccoli in China until the recent decade. Beef and broccoli IS NOT Chinese food! The menu certainly brings back childhood memories. This is authentic northern China home cooking people! I do see some Sichuan dishes and I'm curious to try.   Went with couple co-workers for lunch to check the place out. I ordered the dumplings and the meat pie. The woman that owns the place was extremely nice. The service was above average. She brought out the corn based congee, which I'm assuming comes free with the meal. It's pretty much flavorless but easily fixed by putting in some soy sauce. I'm assuming that's how they are served authentically. The dumplings are ok and could used some additional seasoning. But they aren't super doughy like other Chinese places. I liked the meat pie. It was hot, juicy, and yummy. I can certainly say it was filling and I was stuffed. I'm definitely going back and try out some of the stirfry dishes. Haven't had those for eons and I really hope they live up to expectation. When it comes down to it, it's home cooking. You aren't going to find it superbly amazing like a 4 star restaurant and this is no Imperial cooking, but they are hearty and filling at a decent price. Until I try their other dishes, they'll get 4 stars because the memories made me happy, the service was good, and the food wasn't half bad. :) I really hope they would maybe offer the pork and veggie bao. That would just put it over the top."}
{"text":"First time eating at this restaurant. We walked in and we're not greeted. We had to figure out were to sit. Our waitress was unwelcoming. She asked us what to drink and ran off. The food was great! Shrimp noodles, shrimp fried rice was awesome. I recommend the food and I would work on friendlier service. I loved the food but will not be back."}
{"text":"When you're taste palate out pass the American Chinese food experience and you are craving for something authentic. This place delivers! The braised tofu and spicy eggplant are delicious. Additionally, the dumplings did not disappoint. The taste of the food is equivalent to a restaurant that you would find in a Chinatown. The wait staff are friendly and the dinning areas are clean. Furthermore, if you are true foodie and you're not scared of tasting something new. Try this spot!"}
{"text":"Wonderful surprise.  This reminds me of the Chinese restaurants in the Bay Area that served authentic Chinese food.  Flavors were wonderful and each dish had unique flavors, so good it tempted you to keep eating.  One of the best places in the Phoenix area for authentic Chinese food IMO.  Definitely coming back again.  Submitting 3 pictures but also had the beef pies (beat flavor!) and won ton soup that had a great broth."}
{"text":"I saw a lot of great review so I went to tried it. I order Shrimp fried rice, beef -bread (come with 3) and pork & Shrimp dumpling. The dumpling was raw, I asked for the re-cook. They actually re-cook the same dish, it cause over cook. They are the top Chinese restaurant, however, the service and food quality are very bad."}
{"text":"authentic chinese food. when we are in phoenix, we always get some soup dumplings and scallion pancakes!"}
{"text":"This was easily one of the worst dining experiences I've had. I spent 1 hour in their dining room and the only food that was delivered were warm not hot soup dumplings. They never came back to see what I wanted for my main course after being there for 1 hour. At this time, I asked the server if I could order something. Her response was not now because the chef is eating lunch. Can I order in 10-15 minutes?  Um, no check please. Never again!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here for lunch. We walked in and saw the lunch menu board which was written I Chinese, but the price was not. so I asked the waiter what the lunch special was, he told me in one word ( I think) and walked away. I don't speak Chinese. so this was not helpful to me.  there was about 5 tables in the restaurant, not too busy. but service was slow. took awhile to take our order. when our order came out my husbands came first, then mine and our appetizers. my husband had fried rice and I had Kung Pao chicken, with spring rolls as a appetizer. again service was slow, even getting our check."}
{"text":"very delicious pan fried buns. service is mediocre but i will overlook that when the food is that good. and the food is that good! its a fairly small place and i often see families waiting outside for a table. their booths are quite uncomfortable. i dont know if they are old and worn out or just cheap and flimsy, but when i am sitting behind another booth and someone who isnt even fat leans back, i can feel the booth bounce on me and push me forward. i can also feel their body weight press against my booth too. that is quite annoying but again the food was well worth me practicing my good posture while eating. ive had many things on their menu but my favorite are their appetizers. their dumplings are very tasty. i enjoyed all their clay pot options too but they do take a little longer as would any other place that made clay pot entrees. the workers here do speak some english tho not very well, but again, another thing i am willing to overlook due to great food."}
{"text":"I dined here with a big group of friends spontaneously and ordered many dishes. Ranging from the xiao long bao(XLB), to pig ears and scallion pancake. All tasted really good! The service was attentive with our refills and nothing tasted funky. The dumplings are what they're known for and I'd say to get at least an order to pair with your meal. We all enjoyed this place and I can say we'll back soon!"}
{"text":"First time eating here and I have to say this Chinese restaurant is absolutely delicious and authentic!! Service was great.  Lots of Chinese people here so you know it's a good spot to eat!   I ordered the beef meat pies (3) of them which were absolutely scrumptious. Juicy and very tasty. I also ordered the northern Chinese signature dish which was the spicy pig intestine! Wow I cant really describe how good this dish was. If your into this kind of food it hits the spot! I love menudo and this is the Chinese version which is fantastic. It's like the best of both worlds!!   Will be coming back again soon to try the dumplings and pit stickers!"}
{"text":"Can you say XLB Fail!  CK did not pass the Soup Dumpling standards for my first time here.    Yes it's made to order supposedly...but the XLB didn't have that piping hot soup inside when you bite into it.  What!!  Did the XLB Soup Nazi declare no soup for you inside your dumpling! My XLB was as dry as the AZ weather.  The money shot of the ultimate XLB moment when you bite into it was not to be found....the wrap was also dry from being over steamed for a soup dumpling!  I suspect it's dare I say pre made skins.  Do they half ass it cause of the demographics of the area.    The beef pie was super oily....is it normally way too oily?  I guess I'll never know.  Cause I won't be ordering that again.  Darn you CK!    Linda our server was nice and attentive and even took a seat across from us to chit chat cause it was pretty slow when we ate there.  If I come back it would be look at other options on their menu.    I'm leaving it at 2 stars perhaps there is room for improvement or not.  I'm going to drop by the OG Tempe location first for comparison before I fully abandon the CK ship."}
{"text":"My goal was to introduce my NY friends to a new Chinese restaurant and to show them how a good Yelp rating would lead us to a good dining experience, even though I did not know the area. Strike one and two! Three different dishes and three thumbs down. I am not a dining snob, nor are my NY friends, but the food was a complete disappointment. If bland food were the hallmark of Chinese cuisine, then this would be deserving of the 4+ star rating that attracted me to this small family restaurant. The hostess/waitress was welcoming, but I should have known that that food may not meet our expectations when the waitress informed me that they do not have chinese mustard, only a sweet and sour sauce.   One friend ordered the orange chicken and left 3/4 untouched. I ordered the shrimp fried rice which was dry, tasteless and the shrimp was overcooked. The third peson in our party ordered stir fried vegetables and left half. My friends were kind enough not to say anything until I let be known how disappointed I was with the meal and then they chimed in with their similar feelings. Not being familiar with Yelp they also added, \"do you use this Yelp thing much?\" I do and will continue to do so, but with a little less confidence.   The two stars were for the friendly, welcoming service, and pleasant family atmosphere, but I felt compelled to share our less than ideal dining experience so that others may not be mislead and think their experience will always be as others have raved about. To be fair, it may have been an off night, but clearly our experience was not up to the rating and reviews I had read before going there and unfortunately I will not give them a second chance as there are many other establishments that have proved to meet the expectations that their respective reviews have engendered."}
{"text":"After reading reviews, I was so excited to try this place. I'm originally from California, so it's difficult to find Asian food that would satisfy my tastebuds in Arizona. My boyfriend and I were in the area so I finally got a chance to try it. The ladies that served us were very sweet, and the food was amazing. We ordered the soup dumplings, beef noodle soup, eggplant with ground beef, beef pie, green onion pancakes, and pork and napa cabbage dumplings. I would say I would return specifically for the soup dumplings, as they're something I will definitely crave in the future. They were so juicy and flavored to perfection! The beef pie was also delicious with amazing seasoning. My boyfriend loved the eggplant dish that we ordered, which he completely demolished with his rice. Most of what we ordered exceeded my expectations, except I most likely will not order the beef noodle soup again. It was a bit bland for me. However, I can't wait to return again! I took one star off due to the beef noodle dish, but everything else deserves five stars."}
{"text":"I was so happy to finally find very good Chinese food in Phoenix! We had the xiaolongbao, the beef pies, green onion pancakes and mapo tofu. The service was very fast and efficient. The place was clean and the food was great... Great experience, can't wait to try more of their menu!"}
{"text":"I give 3.5 to 4 stars for food. But for service, it is probably a 2-star or less for me.   SERVICE:  Being Chinese, I know service is never the forte of an authentic Chinese restaurant. But I was still surprised at the lack of service and the total carelessness and cluelessness there. First, they don't seem to care which table orders what so the orders frequently got mixed up when I was there; the server would carry the food and wander around from table to table, asking if anyone ordered this. So I had to watch the plates whenever the server carried them out from the kitchen and stopped her to give mine to me, because the server was walking AWAY from me with my food on her tray.   Second, they started making dumplings 40 minutes after I ordered them. After the dumplings were finally ready, because they forgot who ordered it or simply did not care to check, they let it sit on the side table behind the cashier for another 15 minutes. Our dumplings were finally uncovered when the owner saw the dumplings sitting in the cashier area and started talking loudly in Chinese, \"Whose dumplings are these?\" I had to raise my hand to claim them. So we got our dumplings after we finished our meal and were about to pay the bill.  Third, it was difficult to get hold of a server/owner to ask if the dish was coming out anytime soon. They rushed by your table and never made any eye contact. They don't come by your table and fill your water diligently, or check on your order. The owner was especially warm and hospitable to her acquainted clientele when I was there, but was quite indifferent to others (I guess I shouldn't be surprised how they selectively treat people... in the Chinese way).  FOOD:  In terms of food, I don't have major complaints. The food was good, quite authentic, and fairly priced. But if you ask me to compare Chou's Kitchen to the street food I had growing up in China, Chou's does not come close in taste and quality.  We ordered   (1) Spicy Braised Beef Combination (in Chinese, \"sliced lung by the married couple,\" a dish in chili oil, toasted peanuts, and cilantro with a mixture of beef slices and various beef parts, including stomach--it sounds gross but I dare you to try it). The best dish we got that night. To me, it was not spicy enough because it is traditionally a very hot dish from Sichuan Province. But the flavor was there and I was thrilled to see a dish Chinese restaurants in the U.S. don't normally serve, even though this is a STANDARD appetizer in almost any restaurant in China.  (2) Lamb skewer. Pretty disappointed. It has the similar cumin rub as the ones I would buy from the Xinjiang Uyghur vendors on a street cart in China. But the quality of the lamb was so bad and almost inedible: it was predominantly fat and connective tissues, and the very small amount of lean meat was tough and overcooked.  (3) Fried beef buns (in Chinese, \"water-fried beef buns\"). So-so. Too much dough for my liking and too little filling. Also, not juicy enough.  (4) Soybean Paste Noodle (a soupless \"mix-it-yourself\" cold noodle with cubed ham, sliced cucumber, and a soybean meat sauce). It was extremely basic. The noodle was an alkaline noodle, so it was yellower and more elastic than the average soup noodles. It was a filling dish, but nothing special, and quite bland.  (5) Dumplings with Pork and Napa Cabbage. Yes these are the dumplings that came grossly late so we had to box all of them. For 5 bucks they were great, much better than the ones from the frozen section at a Chinese grocery store. But they were NOT worth the 1.5+ hour wait. I would recommend this dish to people who like homemade Chinese dumplings because they are delicious, not because they are the watery relatives of potstickers. But if they don't come at the end of your meal, you should probably cancel the order.  All in all, it was a decent Chinese eatery with some management/service issues. I saw some items on the menu that I don't usually see elsewhere and they are quite good. But still, these are basic, entry-level Chinese food items that are quick to prepare and hard to mess up. I would probably come back and hope to see an improvement in the structureless service."}
{"text":"I have rated this beautiful place before, but I am rating it again! The food is ALWAYS fantastic. Just amazing. The Mongolian Beef is to die for. LOVE their pot stickers. Everything is just MAGNIFICENT. And to add to it, the owners are such lovely and kind people. It is almost always packed, but man can they get the food out quick. I am on a mission to try everything I possibly can on their menu. THANK YOU Chou's! Sincerely, Your favorite purple haired girl!!"}
{"text":"This local joint is small but pack with big flavors. Hands down the best place for XLB and dumplings in the easy valley. You always see them making their dumplings in the store.  Last Friday I was there around 6:30pm and it was very busy. The place is full with no room to sit while waiting for a table. But it is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place based on the positive yelp reviews.  All in all the trip was a disappointment.    Our food was mediocre at best; my wife's dish was smothered in peppercorn to the point where she was crunching through the whole thing, completely inedible.  We ordered the skewers of lamb that came unseasoned and very sinewy...  lastly the pan fried buns were like McDonald's hamburgers inside of a bun so much grease that the crispy buns were completely soggy and the grease just poured out onto the plate.  Lastly the staff was very unresponsive.  They were sitting in the kitchen in plain sight yet my drink was constantly empty and I couldn't seem to get them interested in coming over.  The only upside was that there Mongolian beef was quite good and the menu offered quite a bit of selection but it will not be enough to warrant a return visit."}
{"text":"First time there and it was waaaay better than what I expected! Also, the servers are very very polite!(:"}
{"text":"I enjoy Dim Sum, but what I enjoy most about Dim Sum is the soup dumplings, or xiao long bao.  So, my review of this place is base purely upon the quality of their pork soup dumplings, and their scallion pancakes.  I'm from Philly where we have Dim Sum Garden, home to the best pork soup dumplings ever created: slurpy hot soup in moist delicious sacs with a morsel of pork in the center.  Chou's  dumplings had good taste, but their skin was wet and soggy.  There was not soup to slurp from them -this I consider to be a deal breaker.  Be that as it may the worst part of the meal was the scallion pancakes, or green onion pancakes-however you call it- they were horrible.  They weren't crispy and flakey but doughy and tasteless.  This is why I'm so amazed it has gotten such great reviews, but then again, I was only judging this place on said items.  Maybe they have much better stuff?  Anyways  almost every restaurant in phoenix has 4 stars."}
{"text":"My wife and I went last night, Friday.  This Chinese \"food\" was possibly the worst I have ever eaten, bar none.  I am a senior citizen and have eaten Chinese food all over the world, literally.  First the good parts: They were prompt at seating us.  Our appetizers arrived in very good time.  They brought us water straight away.  The place is somewhat clean, but not pristine.  The tables could use some wiping down and attention to condiment containers and arrangement.  The servers were polite and a bit attentive, but not great.  That's it.  Now the bad news:  We ordered hot and sour soup, beef pies and onion pancakes for starters as those dishes were raved about in this set of reviews.  The hot and sour soup was neither.  Very bland and almost flavorless, devoid of any semblance of taste, not even properly salted.  I added some of the Chinese vinegar on the table to give it a bit of sourness. The onion pancakes were flat, greasy, doughy, very undercooked and again, completely devoid of any flavor.  The beef pies were the best of the lot offering up a smidgen of taste, really not too bad, but my wife did not care for them.  For mains we ordered beef noodle soup and Kung Pao chicken.  My wife's soup was nothing more than beef broth in a bowl with some highly overcooked starchy noodles, about 3 small slices of some gristly thinly sliced beef and one baby Bok Choy.  She attempted to get some flavor out of it by adding a bit of salt, but the salt shaker was completely caked up.  When we could not get the waiter's attention we finally got the salt shaker from another table that was devoid of patrons at that time.  When the waiter did finally appear my wife pointed out the caked up salt shaker and handed it to him.  Instead of taking the object to the kitchen for some cleaning and rejuvenation, the waiter put the offending salt shaker back on the table from whence we had taken its replacement.  Seriously????  No excuse for that kind of sloppy behavior.  Now two parties would experience a \"no salt\" shaker.  The Kung Pao chicken, which I had ordered a bit extra spicy was pathetic, very small pieces of dryly cooked chicken absolutely smothered in oil.  To make it extra spicy they added, wait for it, sliced Jalapenos, an ingredient I find missing in any Chinese cookbook I have read.  Not a proper Asian type of chili pepper, but Jalapenos!!!  The flavor of the Jalapenos does not go well with the other Chinese spices at all and to top it all, it was not even all that extra spicy.  The food was so bad that we declined take out boxes as I did not feel that any of my own machinations could resurrect this disgusting array of garbage.  I am a gourmet cook by hobby and I have never in my life served even my most casual guests food this bad.  I also had to ask for a refill on my iced tea instead of the waiter attending to that automatically.  Oh, yes, that's another thing.  You can't get any alcohol at all.  That's not a show stopper, but it would have been a nice touch to have a beer with dinner.  The strange thing is that this restaurant has been rated 4 stars on Yelp and was full of Chinese people, usually a good sign.  There is competition out there, a lot of it, so this restaurant needs to raise its game, considerably.  I don't mean to be mean or snobbish, but this dining experience was awful, really awful and it is not that hard to do it right."}
{"text":"The steamed pork dumplings are the best dish i had there so far must try..also the dalian seafood noodle soup is good for all you soup lovers."}
{"text":"The Szechuan spicy beef, beef pie (three!), and pot stickers are the equal of Chinatown in San Francisco and New York. And they deliver!"}
{"text":"Shanghai dumplings are excellent.  Just a great menu, excellent service and rock-bottom prices."}
{"text":"Definitely a gem of a chinese restaurant in Arizona. This is not your typical Chinese restaurant. Their cuisine is from the Northeastern part of China which is know for its braising and dumplings    Try the braised pork neck bones stew and dumpling soup!   I will definitely come back here again.   Excellent food at a budget price!!!"}
{"text":"Always a treat to eat at Chou's. The steamed pork dumplings are fantastic and always very friendly service!"}
{"text":"The soup dumplings are the stars of this place. Eerily similar to a very famous one, which I will not mention. The taste is great, but somehow you cannot replicate the original. The skin on the dumplings was too thick and the soup dumplings didn't hold up super well but still really good.  Tofu and seafood soup was very light and excellent with generous portions of tofu. They were kind enough to remake a dish we ordered of which we considered too salty.   Curious to come here again and try other dishes. Also to satisfy soup dumplings cravings~"}
{"text":"From the moment we walked in I had a bad feeling. Walking up we smelled great food. Unfortunately, that smell must have been coming from the Mexican place next door. Once we were seated there was a very unpleasant odor.   We ordered pot stickers, sweet and sour chicken, and I tried to order beef with snow peas and baby corn.  I was told (awkwardly) that this is a real Chinese restaurant; no snow peas, no baby corn.  Fine.  We waited a while for food. My beef dish arrived. To be fair, this dish was pretty decent.  We waited over 10 minutes for my date's food to show up. When it did, we weren't sure if it was really bad chicken or really bad pork, but either way it was horrible. We immediately asked for a box for the beef, and the bill.  When she brought the bill out, it had all three items on it. With the bill she brought the pot stickers.  I told her the bill was wrong and that she needed to take the chicken and the pot stickers off. She told me \"you ordered them, you must pay\".  I told her the pot stickers came late, and the chicken was foul (lol), and that I could either pay for the beef and walk out, or simply walk out. She walked to the kitchen and screamed something in Chinese, then threw the modified bill at our table, all the while mumbling in Chinese to the other Chinese patrons.  We will not be returning."}
{"text":"I have been here about 5 times now.  So it's pretty safe to write a review.  A little bit about me.  Born in Taipei and grew up in NorCal.  Been to Taiwan ~15 times in the past 10 yrs for business.  So I do know quite a bit about Chinese food.  Always love dumpling and noodle dishes.  Try them out everywhere whenever possible.  Small restaurant with lots of Northern Chinese dishes.  Noodle and dumping are generally good to great.  Very authentic IMO.  If you like noodle soup, you will love the beef noodle soup here.  A good way to tell how authentic a Chinese restaurant is to see how many customers are actually Chinese.  This place is usually about 75% Chinese.  Very friendly to family but the restaurant is small and maybe seat 1-2 big table only.  Lots of good options on the menu.  Both my wife and I like the cold appetizer salad-like dishes.  About $40-60 for a family of 4.  So it's quite affordable."}
{"text":"Made-from-scratch beef pies and pork pies are amazing! The dumplings and garlic eggplant with pork were also very good. The noodle dishes were okay but are not the main attraction. Food prices are very affordable. This place is great to head to with a group of 3-4 so you can all try a little of everything. The orders of 3 pies can be increased to orders of 4, just don't be afraid to ask if desired. Service typically leaves something to be desired but you're there for the food. It's worth driving out of your way to head here. I've been here twice and will be back again soon."}
{"text":"Pretty awesome food! Decor is nothing special. Don't be intimidated by the strip mall location. Hand made dumpling (order the special dipping sauce) were fantastic!"}
{"text":"Now my fav local spot for authentic Chinese food. Will have to come by more, there are many items I'd like to try out.  The spicy shredded potato was just ok not that spicy, but the cilantro and jalapeño salad was delicious, and the cumin lamb was the perfect flavor i've been searching for since i discovered it in Taiwan. The service is top notch, friendly and responsive."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese restaurant in this area. Good food, good environment, good service, good price."}
{"text":"Wow! The portions are unusually large, so don't let the prices or lack of Lunch Specials scare you. This place is in its own class... Quality beyond other Chinese restaurants. Nice and attentive staff. I would encourage going with a group, so everyone could try different dishes. It's been a while since I got so excited about a restaurant."}
{"text":"I really really really wanted to love this place.  Almost all Asian customers.  The waitress was the nicest waitress I have ever encountered.    I had the eggplant and potatoes with jalapeno.  Only I asked for just a tiny bit of jalapenos because I am a wimp.  The waitress misunderstood our discussion and substituted green pepper for the jalapeno and I don't like green pepper.  The food was super greasy and almost flavorless.  :(  Won't be back."}
{"text":"FYI, their lunch break is at 3:00 - 4:30 pm.    Some seats are a little sticky but overall, the restaurant is pretty clean. Service is very traditional Chinese so you do have to get the server's attention for service. The restaurant is often filled with a lot of International Chinese Students which I assume means the dishes taste pretty authentic.   I've tried the Xiao Long Bao (Soup Dumplings), Kung Pao Chicken, Szechuan Chicken, Sweet & Sour Chicken, and Eggplant Stir Fry with Minced Pork. All were pretty good, but I hope you like the taste of black vinegar.   I definitely plan on coming back and exploring more of their menu!"}
{"text":"Came to this place because of YELPs high rankings. When you first enter there is no hostess station or any area so you're left standing with everyone awkwardly looking at you since the door faces the dining area. When we were finally seated we got the beef pie, beef and broccoli stir fry and sezechuan chicken. The beef cakes were really good, but the beef and broccoli and the chicken was mediocre. I'd come here to try their dumplings and other small dishes that they are making in the window, but otherwise I wouldn't come here again... Especially with the service."}
{"text":"This isn't a review so much as it is a love letter...  Chou's Kitchen saved my roommate Megan T. and I from dying of homesickness for a full summer in Arizona by providing DELICIOUS AND AUTHENTIC Chinese food.  The dishes here are SO ON POINT and prices are super reasonable, even compared to Bay Area prices :)   MUST GET DISHES: - Stir-Fry Eggplant & Minced Pork with Garlic Sauce: Guys. This dish is EVERYTHING. The Szechuan-style sauce is so flavorful and goes really well with rice. Like, too well with rice....because I end up eating too much and feeling regret mixed with immense satisfaction. - Dry Green Beans with Pork: The green beans have the PERFECT amount of bite to them - Spicy Cold Noodle With Cucumber: Mouth-numbing Ma-La goodness that's extra amazing on a hot day. Beware, though, if you're afraid of spicy oil, this is not the dish for you.  I will say, though, that the various baos and dumplings they serve here are just okay. The xiao long baos are quite small, but still pack a good amount of soup in them. I would skip the sheng jian baos - the skin to filling ratio is way too high!  I'll end by saying that my roommate and I ordered at least 4 dishes for the two of us each time we went to ensure that we had enough leftovers to last us well into the week. If that's not love, I don't know what is. Chou's, you will be missed when I move out of AZ!"}
{"text":"we love this place.  the beef buns are like giant siu-lung-bows that are sure to satisfy the meat lovers cravings.  Very friendly cordial staff.  If you're hankerin' for some northeastern chinese cuisine, you'll find no other in southeast valley.  Not dirt cheap but the food is fresh and of the highest quality."}
{"text":"I am so glad we found this place! The food quality is fantastic and the prices are phenomenal! The food comes out steaming hot which I absolutely love. It can take a bit longer but trust me, it's so worth it when your food is that hot!  We ordered the dumplings which were really tasty. I can't remember which ones we ordered though, I want to say soup dumplings but don't quote me.   We got the beef stir fry which was so good, definitely something to get when you need some good comfort food.   The lamb cumin is amazing! Oh my gosh, we scarfed it down! The spices, warmth, and crisp veggies stole the show. They were phenomenal.   The part I loved most was at the end the owner sat down with us and talked with us. We told her how much we loved everything and how we wanted to try more on the menu, so she said that she'd help us pick more \"traditional\" items the next time we come in.   If you go, try the beef pie! The owner said it was fabulous, and it's on our hit list for next time!"}
{"text":"I call it Northern EurAsian style because of the dominant use of wheat dough, much like Eastern European countries instead of rice being the staple in majority of Asian dishes.  Dongbai is not a very popular Chinese  cuisine compared to Schizuan , Beijing, Shanghai or Cantonese.  It is considered peasant food of Manchuria...but oh so comforting.  The meat pie is a must try.  Simply a ground beef patty peppered with Chinese spices wrapped in a flaky dough and pan cooked.  Pancake with chives reminds me so much of me forgetting of the leavening, resulting in a doughy dense mess. My little cutie pie ate two pieces drizzled in vinegar.  He couldn't wait to try it after watching the lady make the dough behind the glass by the register.  Stir fried shrimp in wheat noodles  is deliciously drenched in brown sauce.  My hubby opted for the stir fried Cumin Lamb, rich in the smokiness of cumin with just the right amount of chili oil and vegetables.  The menu is pretty extensive for such a small little whole in the wall place.   Potstickers or dumplings are next on our list.  Can't wait to take friends and family here and see what they think.  p.s. xia long bao"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!  So happy to find soup dumplings in AZ!   This is a small place and we had to wait 20 minutes outside for a table but it was worth the wait.  We tried the orange chicken and house stir fry noodles -so yummy!  The soup dumplings were the highlight of our dinner.  I could of had many more.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First visit came early on a Saturday night and got seated promptly.  All the dishes were spot on extremely authentic and spectacular .   Xiao lung bao( soup dumplings) were juicy and great.   Beef pies were fabulous.   Stir fried tofu pork and celery was exactly how my grandma used to make it."}
{"text":"This place is by far my favorite ! The employees are so kind & friendly. The food is amazing!!! The dumplings are delicious. The noodles are fantastic! The wonton soup is one of my favorites! Great selection even for picky children! This place has the whole package delicious hot food & great service. It is very affordable too. The hot and sour soup is the best!!!"}
{"text":"If you like real ethnic Chinese food (as opposed to \"Americanized\") this place is the bomb!   A great selection of mostly Northeastern Chinese dishes, there hasn't been anything on the menu that wasn't acceptable, and many dishes that are just amazing. On the mediocre side was the orange chicken, but all the cold and noodle dishes I've had have been good. I try at least one new dish every single time I'm here.  But without a doubt the best thing on the menu is xiao long bao (Juicy Pork Dumplings, P13) - these are just amazing! Also extremely noteworthy are the House Special Sweet and Sour Pork (C08) -- this is unlike any \"Americanized\" S&S Pork dish I've had...a much better sauce and crispy flash-fried flat pieces of pork that curl up when fried -- it's like crispy pork candy! Recently I discovered the Salt and Pepper Calamari (F08) which is also fabulous, a great salt/pepper flavor and the best fried squid I've had.  Service can be hit or miss, as mentioned in a couple of other reviews. It is very busy at lunch because of the University crowd (I regularly eat here with a group of 8-10) and a good mix of people of diverse cultures, who would find the food both familiar and exotic.  Definitely a must-try place if you like ethnic food!"}
{"text":"Wow! My lovely and accommodating wife and I came here on a whim. I am always looking for Chinese food like you find in China. American style Chinese food is good, but the real thing from China is so much better. The place at the Chinese cultural center is good but this place is as good or better and it's cheaper and more accessible.   This is the real deal if you want Chinese food that is just like you would find in Beijing. I used to live in Beijing, China for about 10 years and this place does Chinese food just like the northern Chinese do it. So delicious! I can't believe my luck in finding this place. Another good sign: by the time we left, the place was packed, and we were the only non-Asian people there.   This is the only place I have found in the valley that has xia long bao or \"soup dumplings\". And it is as good or better than the famous place in LA. The broth was so flavorful and delicious. It was a tad difficult getting the dumplings out of the steamer so be careful or it will tear and the soup will leak out. What I have been doing that works is that when the steamer comes out, I immediately move the dumplings around so that they don't stick as they cool. Makes it way easier to get them out without tearing and loosing all the \"soup\".  We also had the twice cooked Pork.  Delicious. The pork belly was cooked beautifully and it also had dried pressed tofu in it which was very nice variation.  We also had green beans with minced pork. A tad overcooked, but still delicious.   On our second visit we had a delicious cold dish or sliced cucumbers in a garlic sauce. Be sure to get this. A huge portion and so flavorable. The garlic was not sharp so don't worry.  On the second visit we also has the eggplant in chili garlic sauce. Nicely sweet, but not over so and just the right amount of sauce. My wife loves it and she doesn't like spicy food so it was mild.  The rice was good and everything comes with more than enough rice.   The service was 5/5. The wait staff were all from northern China provinces and spoke wonderful English.   This location has only been open since August, they are off to a wonderful start.   Food 5/5. Overall 5/5. I am soooo happy that I have finally found a place to satisfy my real Chinese food cravings."}
{"text":"I remember going to the thai place and hawaiin place before that in this plaza before, and I was never impressed with the area or food.  I didn't think I was ever going back until I saw two separate articles from azcentral and new times on Chou's Kitchen.  It's tucked towards the end of a bland strip mall on the southwest corner of Ray and Alma School.  The decor is simple and clean.  We were seated and helped almost immediately.  I've been raving about these meat pies (don't you just love saying that word?) to my gf all day.  We got the pork meat pies, the bean curd with pork, noodles with shrimp, and green onion pancakes.  The meat pies were awesome.  Three came per serving.  They tasted like the filling of a pork steamed bun flattened with a flaky savory pastry crust around it.  Excellent.  The bean curd with pork and celery was crispy, fresh, and not too oily.  It wasn't bad but nothing to tell mom about.  Unfortunately, the green onion pancakes had the look and aroma of deliciousness but lacked green onions to give it a punch.  It tasted like meat pies.. minus the meat.  The noodles with shrimp was standard fare.  Interestingly enough they used lo mein noodles instead of something thinner we thought they would.  They were nice enough to offer us a corn like clear soup, but it was very bland.  I wasn't sure if it was supposed to be savory or desert tasting.  Overall, the meat pies are excellent at the place.  We spent $25 and came out full and happy.  It also helps the place was jam packed with asian people which is a good sign.  Next time, I'm going to go back and try some of their soup/stews that I saw everyone else ordering, and I may change my rating."}
{"text":"Good chinese food is hard to find in AZ. This place us legit!!! This is coming from a chinese east coaster. The beef stew noodles in soup is tasty. Gotta try the beef pies, they are awesome! The green onion pancakes are pretty good too."}
{"text":"Authentically tasting, inexpensive Chinese food amongst a humble collection of restaurant and stores. We ordered the steamed pork dumplings and chicken stir fry noodles.   Food: 4 Stars. I thought the pork dumpling flavors were excellent. The moist and chewy wrapping conceals the steamy tender pork that is spiced just right. They are quite hot, so use caution before biting into the dough. The noodles were also quite delicious and easily deemed \"Asian comfort food.\" They were somewhat greasy, with that stick to your bones consistency. The noodles are dense and best shared by at least two people.   Ambiance/Service: 2 Stars. Maybe it was just this particular occasion, but I did not feel very comfortable sitting in the restaurant. Here's why: we were positioned at a booth near the wall, where one side was padded and the other was a wooden bench. It was fine enough, but then, through the padded side, you could feel every wiggle and squirm from the people in the booth behind us. At one point, I found myself battling against them to keep my back support in a normal upright position! Meanwhile, my wife ordered a coke (served in a can) and I had water. Neither were refilled nor did we see the servers very much to even ask. These aren't deal breakers, but a little added attention would have done wonders for the evening.   Overall, I like what I tasted and would be willing to come back and try out more from the menu."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews on this place we just had to go. We met up with some great friends who live in the same area. Thankfully they are foodies just like we are, so we ordered up a plethora of deliciousness and the person who waited the table told us we must have did a lot of research ahead of time. We had the eggplant with potatoes and jalepena, beef pies, sesame bread with green onion, pork pot stickers which had this terrific crusty top, pork rib noodle soup (with homemade noodles), ribs with green beans potatoes and eggplant and shredded potato with jalepeno. Nothing was short of just darn delicious. Highly recommend anyone to just try this place but don't expect the standard Chinese fare of orange chicken or fried rice dishes. The waitress was hilarious and added a flair to the whole experience. Friday night at 6:45 and we were seated immediately, the place was packed and well worth it!"}
{"text":"So, Im guessing this is authentic asian cuisine. Some items on the menu, didn't seem very appetizing to my Americanized pallet. (Pig intestine...) Anyway, we went here on Monday night. We were greeted sort of happily in the quiet restaurant. (Seemed liked it needed a healthy clean and remodel). Anyway...we ordered the steamed potstickers and beef pies for appetizer. Beef pies were like pierogi with a softer than wonton outside. They were a bit greesy, but my dinner guests liked them. The potstickers didn't arrive until after the other food arrived...annoying. But they were fairly good with their 'pate type' pork filling. (No sauce to dip in, btw). We then ordered the sweet and sour chicken, house special stir fry, and shrimp fried rice. SS chicken was terrible. It was so hard and crunchy, I could hardly eat it. My 3 year old son couldnt either. Although the sauce was nice. And my husband insisted it was pork, with the meat we could barely taste. The house special (beef, shrimp, chicken) was okay. I didnt try much. And the fried rice, super bland. It needed soy sauce or something! When asked if they had sauce on the side for it to add, they said no. They had no sauce. What??? Service was subpar and the meal was subpar. However, I commend them on how busy the restaurant got after 5:30pm. We must have misordered, or weren't too adventurous enough or something to find the gems of this place. So sorry we couldn't like it. :( Maybe we'll try again?"}
{"text":"First Chinese restaurant since moving to Tempe Az from Washington DC. Bad experience overall. Was not impressed with the staff. Seemed like we were forgotten about. My wife and I did not think the food tasted good at all. Possibly the worst Chinese we ever had. We got to go boxes for all of the food because we had trouble eating it. I tried offering the food to a homeless guy in the parking lot and he didn't want any of it either."}
{"text":"Chou's offers the best Chinese food in Arizona, hands down.  Granted, that sounds like a back-handed compliment such as \"the tallest building in Fresno\" or \"the best song by Nickleback,\" but the food is truly outstanding. The Phoenix area now offers several good Asian eateries and Chou's is at the top of the pack.  On our first visit, we had the potstickers, Kung Pao Chicken and Green Beans with Pork. Holy [fill in the blank] were they amazing. The owners were great too, offering great conversation, advice and lightning-fast service.   Most Chinese food in town is really lousy. A few restaurants are acceptable in a pinch. But I would be proud to bring guests from any city to Chou's and they would love every bite."}
{"text":"Most authentic chinese restaurant in Phoenix. I was spoiled living in NYC and is thankful to have found this place. The food isn't fancy chinese but is very home style."}
{"text":"I just left here. Haven't been here before and will not come again. I ordered two dishes. One of them looked like something I had eaten before at another, similar, restaurant. I didn't like it and they said they were sorry and left it on the table. When it came time to pay it was on the bill. You order, you pay."}
{"text":"I love this place and it was a suggestion from one of my employees. I like the local Chinese dishes like the spicy chicken, dumplings, vegetables. I recommend it."}
{"text":"LOVED it!!! As a Malaysian-Chinese person, it tasted authentic and not whitewashed (you get what I mean). I ordered spicy claypot pork with chilies and wowzaaaa it packed a punch but they gave me a good large sized serving AND it had a bunch of rice too with it! :D I savored every bite. There was a lot left over too, which was AWESOME! I highly approve of this place. Yummy affordable Chinese food!!! I'm SOLD! Need to come here everyday now haha. My bf (who's American) ordered Mongolian beef and we both thought it was delicious. I find it hard to find good Chinese food that is authentic so this was such a find! Thanks to my bf for bringing me here on our date! Great service as well. Food came in a timely fashion and staff were neat and polite! :)"}
{"text":"As authentic as it gets, food wise, for a Chinese restaurant.  Everything is made fresh to order, the appetizers were delicious, as was everything else we had.  Don't let the outside scare you away, it's located in an older strip mall, the place is small and family owned.  For two people, we had 2 appetizers,  a \"small\" bowl of Won Ton soup that I thought would be just enough for one person but could have fed four, and two entrees, our bill came to $36. The menu isn't your typical Chinese restaurant menu, what with pig intestines, pig stomach, pig ears, etc...but it also has familiar dishes like Kung Pao Chicken, Mongolian Beef, etc...  I read some of the other reviews to figure what to order and we had the Beef Pies and Dumpling Appetizers to start, the Won Ton soup, Mongolian Beef, and Szechwan Chicken.  It all was delicious.  Surprised to see there were no egg rolls or spring rolls on the menu but they weren't missed.  The only thing I would change is get rid of the glasses of tap water and replace it with a pot of tea.  I give them 5 stars for the food, the decor could use an upgrade."}
{"text":"Great place. Finally found a nice Chinese restaurant in AZ. We r vegetarian and were very happy with the decent selection and authentic flavors and taste."}
{"text":"Very authentic Northern Chinese cuisine. The onion pancakes and steamed dumplings are my favorite. Price is affordable and it won't tear a hole in your wallet. Great place and great food!"}
{"text":"This is the most authentic Chinese cuisine I've had in 20 years.  Thank you for your quality and delicious food.  The service is outstanding and they immediately acknowledge you and treat you like they are so happy you are here.  I feel at home.  We will keep coming back and refer to everyone we know."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious. Get help ordering from the staff- a lot of things on the menu you've likely never heard of, and we certainly had some food envy over the dishes on other tables!"}
{"text":"I have no complain with the food except the waiter and waitress.  Both of them doesn't have any knowledge of food. All they know is how to take orders.  Even taking the orders they fight with me how i want my dishes to cook.  The guy said if u eat raw green beans you will get sick.  How could it be, every American people eat raw veggies  Da.....i eat raw beans my whole life.  I am still alive and here. they shows nice green beans picture on the wall but when they cook they killed the beans to dead. I just ask the waiter not to over cook the beans.  Than he start telling me i will get sick if i eat raw.  unless they don't wash the beans and serve it to the customers.  Those 2 helpers like to tell the customer what  can we eat and how to eat or sit.  LOL  The orther  dish i ordered was eggplant.  I was asking the waitress to cook little softer, again she argued with me for mushy egg plant is not good.  If the customer want mushy food than give the mushy food to them.  Why take it so much time and  trouble to tell the customer.  This is not the first time i have been there. Why give her options if not ask? Both of the waiter and waitess like to argue and make everyone to eat the way how they like to eat. She tried to incharged of the customers.  I feel sorry for the owner.  Have to deal with these 2 helpers everyday.  Without customers, they willnot get tips or pay.  Do they think of it.  Looks like we go there and do them a favor.  LOL.    These 2 front helpers are no brains to think.  They have no right to give option to customer unless it ask. I will not go back there in the future"}
{"text":"The best Chinese food in Chandler.  Their Won tons soup is very flavorful.  Love the taste.  Better than the chinese food from we had in LA i tried before.  We have the spicy fish dish. That is also good too.  So  Yummy"}
{"text":"Lovely little North-Eastern Chinese restaurant, here in the desert!  Next to their telephone and the cash register is a glass-encased booth where they make their noodle products the old way by hand.  I watched them make potstickers and dumpling, as they have for centuries, with delicious care.  You can tell when you bite into one that it was not store bought but made at the moment, with the perfect chew and juicy flavor.  You must come here to eat these heavenly morsels.  I ate their potstickers and the pork and shrimp dumplings.  Best I have ever had anywhere, and I have savored these tasty morsels in Bangkok and HongKong and the Chinatowns of New York, San Francisco, Seattle, and Vancouver!  I had to remove one star for their rendition of Salt and Pepper Calamari, as they were tough and almost tasteless.  I think you can eat any dish that has a noodle listing, all 14 of them, and the 14 listed noodle soups, and the 15 Hand Made Dumpling dishes on the menu, and not go wrong!  I will be back to try them all."}
{"text":"This is an excellent authentic Chinese Restaurant!  I would give it a 5 star with just a bit better service at the table, but that is NOT a reason to avoid this location.  The owner is friendly, the food comes out hot and fresh, and the clientele is mostly Chinese which tells me it truly is a great place to eat.  We tried many different dishes.  I do mean different.  If you like the traditional Americanized  Chinese food, you will be disappointed.  If you like authentic cuisine, head right in.  We will go back!"}
{"text":"There's no doubt that the beef buns and green onion pancakes are really good.  The shrimp fried rice and orange chicken were good not great.  It's just a small strip mall chinese joint, nothing fancy.  A humble hole in the wall with tasty food and a pleasant staff.  Will be back."}
{"text":"I don't get all the high reviews. Location is a horrible strip mall, food is mediocre at best, and service is slower than even the slowest sloth. Unfortunately, this is Arizona and just about everything is sub-par here. At least they didn't poison me. Will I be back? No. I'd rather eat something from the frozen food section at 7-11. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a place that doesn't have your typical Americanized Chinese food, this place has a lot of different dishes. I'm very new to authentic Chinese food but so far the flavors have blown my mind. Their spicy beef tendon dish is really really good and I'm addicted to it. Good prices too."}
{"text":"By far my favorite Chinese restaurant in the valley.  I stumbled upon their Chandler location years ago when they first opened and those meat pies have been on my mind ever since!  My whole group loved everything!  I love the meat pies, and my group also loved the juicy dumplings and the pot stickers. The garlic chicken was good but different than I expected and not as good as everything else. In addition, the service was great.  So happy to see them doing well and expanding to Tempe Highly recommend you check out this little gem!!"}
{"text":"This is an authentic northern Chinese cuisine restaurant. The menu has all of the favorites. The service is excellent with servers fluent in both Mandarin and English. The litmus test is that it is very popular with all of the Chinese exchange students from nearby Arizona State University Tempe."}
{"text":"Good food and friendly service but the men's room could use some cleaning action. I'm glad to see some good Chinese food in our part of town."}
{"text":"The food isn't salty like all other Chinese food, and they don't use MSG! My friend and I enjoyed every bit of our meal. Price is very reasonable. For $65 (drinks, 4 dishes and two 10 piece dumplings), the two of us were able to stuff ourselves plus split leftovers and go home for a second meal with our husbands. The dumplings are made in house... Delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"I might try again, The beef cakes were just ok for me. The service wasnt very friendly."}
{"text":"Extensive menu, from cold dishes to soups and clay pot meals. Lady was hand making dumplings as we ordered."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here on a Friday afternoon, and everything was excellent! I had the beef fried rice and a spinach garlic dish. My husband had beef fried rice, potstickers, and spring rolls. He liked everything, especially the fried rice. I loved the fried rice as well, and the garlic spinach was so fresh and delicious. The service was excellent as well - very friendly and fast. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The green onion pancakes are wonderful! Any dish that has noodles is going to be remarkable.   Judging from how many Chinese customers they have, I fee comfortable in the authenticity of this terrific little restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp we found this hidden gem! It's about 20 minutes outside of Phoenix but worth every mile drive from Sedona. We were craving authentic Chinese cuisine -- specifically hand pulled noodles and dumplings and we found Chou's Kitchen. Like some of the other Yelpers have said, please do a flash mob here to support local businesses. The owner lady is friendly and helpful with the dish recommendations. Please see my pics of the yummy pan fried beef buns, green onion pancakes, freshly made napa cabbage and pork dumplings, and the cold salad appetizer of parsley, green onions and jalapeños. Once seated, you will get a complimentary bowl of cornmeal porridge (very typical in Beijing cuisine). We would definitely come back if we are ever in the area."}
{"text":"Searched on here for some Asian restaurants with decent reviews and we decided to check out Chou's. Glad we did because the food was EXCELLENT. They have a lot to choose from and the prices are very affordable. The portion sizes are HUGE, so bring your appetite (We had a lot of leftovers and only ordered 3 items). Watching them make their handmade dumplings was fun and they were soft and fluffy when they were delivered.  Service was very attentive (Almost too attentive but didn't bother us) and friendly to boot.  Great food and service. We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I'm super torn on this review between 3 and 4 stars.  I'm settling on 4 because I only tried 2 things and the first one was so good I'm willing to give the benefit of the doubt on other menu items.  Beef pies were absolutely awesome.  I got my order to go and spent the entire drive back to work practically drooling because they smelled so good. The other item I ordered was the wonton noodle soup.  First the soup was literally the most bland soup I have ever tasted and in addition, the wontons were so mushy they fell apart as I tried to get them out of the bowl.  The noodles however were decent, but I had to add a lot of seasoning to my order to get it to have any flavor at all. Next time I go I will definitely try something else."}
{"text":"Greasy, salty, and lacking taste, this restaurant has really let me down with their mediocre Northeastern Chinese cuisine. However we did get take out so maybe due that ?"}
{"text":"New to this restaurant but I have to say that I was not disappointed. Food was excellent and the service was polite and quick. Mongolian Beef was amazing!!"}
{"text":"If your idea of Chinese is Panda Express, PF Chang's, or Pei Wei, you should understand that what you're eating is white people recipes made by Mexican cooks. Which, don't get me wrong, is great on a day I want sugar-glazed orange chicken and fortune cookies, but \"authentic\" Chinese food are usually on the more outlandish side of things to the American palate. If you like noodles that look like intestines and intestines that look like jellyfish and jellyfish that look like pancreas, and you like your beef dry and slightly sour and a hot and sour soup that's actually hot and sour, this is down your alley.  It's a breath of fresh air to have food that tastes more like what, literally, mom used to make at home. The meat pies, dumplings, noodles, and soups are all pretty great. They have some dishes like spicy chicken but you don't really grab a big bowl of rice with chicken and beef with northern Chinese cuisine.  That being said, service is like a '90s website: slow and unresponsive. Also, the attention they paid to the decor is about what you'd expect in a warehouse."}
{"text":"Was looking for authentic place to go with my husband that was not the typical chain restaurant that I eat at in Scottsdale, where I live, and just wanted really good food without all the sugary brown sauce and MSG. Well we found it at Chou's Kitchen.  We ordered the juicy steamed pork dumplings that I observed being made by hand right behind the window. I felt like I was in Chinatown or in their very home. No atmosphere really; but smiling, friendly, young server and kitchen staff. Most of the customers were actually Chinese.  We also had the eggplant in Garlic Sauce as well as Chicken with string beans and their pork fried rice. Everything was so delicious, made to order and from scratch. I highly recommend this place. Oh and table served with chopsticks. It's so nice to eat a whole meal with chopsticks, the way you do in Chinatown. You take your time and the food is better digested. I'll be back!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Oh man, this place is a gem! The people are friendly and the food blows any other place I have been to out of the water! The portions are huge, but the bill won't be, if you are in the area, I recommend this place hands down!"}
{"text":"Good Chinese.  If you are a whitey like me, ask for it Chinese style and you will get a much better version of what is on the menu!  Obviously, try the many homemade dumplings."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in the Valley!  I love their beef pies and usually get those first. I also think their beef in chili oil is delicious.   Another great one is Cumin Beef. Owner is extremely nice and always welcoming. Ive never been to China but Ive been told this is authentic northern Chinese food."}
{"text":"I don't like to do this but this was some of the worst Chinese food that I have ever had. The Hot and Sour soup was bland. It literally tasted like chicken stock with some stuff thrown into it. The only thing that was hot about it was the temperature not the the flavor. The General Tso's was horrible as well. The chicken was gooie and not firm. It again had no flavor. All I tasted was corn syrup from the sauce.   Anyways... don't eat here. We did because it was close and didn't want to drive. Huge mistake. Don't be lazy like us. Get in the car and go to a real Chinese food place like JK Gourmet in Gilbert. Now that is good Chinese food!  I don't understand how this place has 4 stars. Ya'll who rate this place high need to get your taste buds checked to make sure you have the sense of TASTE still. Salt, pepper, chili powder... you know all those great delicious things in the bottles in the cooking/baking aisle in the grocery store. Yeah, learn how to use them. It makes your food come out way more appetizing."}
{"text":"I was very happy to find a restaurant with such a good variety of choices out there near Phoenix. I searched xiao long bao and this restaurant popped up. Food was delicious and had a homemade taste and service was friendly. The only real downside was that their xiao long bao were not as juicy as I had hoped for, but did the job anyway."}
{"text":"My husband and I are obsessed with the place.  We both traveled around China for 2 months while I was studying abroad and this is the only place in the valley we've found that can even come close to the wonderful dishes we had the pleasure of tasting during our travels.  My favorite items:  the spicy pig intestines (yes it may sound gross but it is to die for), the garlic eggplant (melt in your mouth delicious) and the pork buns.  The service has always been friendly and quick. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Excellent! Recently moved to Phoenix from Philadelphia. I can't remember tasting anything this delicious before and that says a lot coming from an area robust in Asian cuisine. I picked up the family tofu, beef buns, and pork dumplings. All amazing."}
{"text":"A very homey place. The chef came out and personally recommended some dishes, and told us that they could cook anything not on the menu for you if you brought the ingredients or ordered in advanced.   We ordered the meat pies that were highly reviewed, the potstickers, and the beef stew noodles. The meat pies were on the salty and oily side. The potstickers had a savory filling, but the outside was not pan fried long enough so there was no crunch. The beef stew noodles featured a very rich broth with hints of star anise.   I personally would skip the meat pies/potstickers and order dumplings with beef noodles next time. I'd recommend this place if you're looking for authentic northern Asian food in Tempe!"}
{"text":"I hope being named one of Travel & Leisure's best Chinese food restaurant in the country doesn't ruin the place.  i.e. I hope that folks don't flock there and then the kitchen gets lazy.  Right now, it's a great mom and pop, hole in the wall, blink and you miss it place with tasty non-typical Chinese fare. The food here is dongbei which translates to \"East/North\".  ie. this is the style of food you get in the Northernmost Easternmost regions of China.  No rice here.  You will find cumin on lamb, wheat buns stuffed with minced meat and a delicious cold noodle dish that is the most refreshing salad you'll find in all of China. (The Cantonese aren't exactly known for their salads after all)    The food is going to be assertive. The main dipping sauce is black vinegar after all.  Not a lot of veggies on the menu which could be difficult for your vegetarian friends, but for those who love pot stickers, they make great ones.  The food is dirt cheap, bring a mess of friends and grab a formica table.  Between this place, China Magic Noodle House and Hong Kong Gourmet, I can actually be tempted outside my 10 mile (Phoenix) radius from time to time.  Bonus:  They actually seem friendlier than most Chinese restauranteurs.  (Again, who knows what it'll be like after the publicity)"}
{"text":"We shared an order of Orange Chicken that had not a hint of orange flavor, though it did include some razor-thin slices of orange and a syrupy sauce on a bed of wilted lettuce. The chicken was tough, tasted as though it had been cooked a week earlier, and appeared to be dark meat. Yuck!  We also shared the pot stickers, filled with pork and cabbage, but not any of the latter was present. Tasteless and bland. The \"green onion pancakes\" were greasy and had no trace of onion. Next time, there won't be a next time."}
{"text":"Was craving some Chinese food on this particular night.  Pretty good location and good-size parking lot outside, no issues there. Insides is pretty big and clean.  We came around 8:30 p.m., still some people inside but We were seated pretty quickly and lots of open tables on a Friday night. They open to around 10 I believe.  Pretty good variety of choices and dishes on the menu. Decided to get the spicy fish in the hot pot, bean curd / pork /tofu dish with spicy added, And the Xiao long bao. Good amount of food for two people. Definitely had some leftover.  For the spicy fish dish, it was better than I expected. Spiciness is exactly where I like it. Lots of fish in the dish. They did not skip out on quantity. Within the dish there is also cabbage and bean sprout at the bottom. The spiciness may numb some people's tongue, but it was fine for me.  With regards to the bean curd / tofu/pork dish, having them make it spicy is way better in my opinion, even though I never had it without it being spicy here. They could have put more pork in the dish, but what they did have was okay. Taste-wise, it's okay, but I'm more used to a different type of flavor that I was hoping to get.  With regards to the Xiao long bao, the skin covering was a little bit more thicker than what I'm used to. The meat on the inside was actually pretty good and the flavor was decent as well. There is a little bit of juice and soup inside the dumpling, but not a whole lot if you're used to having a lot. Temperature wise it was warm, but it got cold pretty fast if you don't eat it fast. Comes with the side of the dipping sauce which has more vinegar then when I'm used to. Nonetheless, The Dumpling plus the sauce was good together.  They apparently have another restaurant in Chandler which is supposed to be better, according to someone that ate here before. But pretty good in my opinion for my first time here.  Server was nice and quick and attentive. One of the better Chinese restaurant that I have been to over in Phoenix.  Probably will check out the one in Chandler next time to compare. But if you're in Tempe and you're craving some Chinese food, you can check it out here."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Tears For Fears - Shout)  Chou's Chou's Xiao Long Bao These are the foods I can't do without Bo Bites I'm singing to you Bo Bites  In hungry times You shouldn't have to settle for more In Chou's Kitchen They really really serve you know Those fried noodles That taste you were always looking for  Kiss them goodbye That made you have to order more That made you have to order for more!   Chou's Kitchen seems to be located in a corner of nowhere-land I call it.  Next to a Mexican restaurant and a Goodwill this place didn't really stick out at first.  As I entered however I was great a familiar \"How many\" in broken English and I was like; yep this is my kind of joint!  My friends and I sat at the front of the house as I couldn't see much in the back, but I was peppered by the sight of the all the accolades this place has received from Yelp and food writing establishments.  Guess it's Bo Bites turn!  We started with the XLB or #111 at this restaurant and some Beef Pies.  Along the way we ordered our entree, String Beans with Minced Pork, House Fried Noodles, and Pork Ribs w Green Bean, Potatoes & Eggplant Clay Pot.  Overall, the XLB is popping; nice and steaming hot with a pop of juice with every bite.  I would say the best I've had in town for sure!  The Beef Pies were my favorite, it was similar to the XLB, but more crunch from the fried shell and had more meat.  I eat string beans anywhere they make it and this one in particular was the same as many other Chinese restaurants.  None of us really cared for the Clay Pot simply because it just seemed like a mush of cooked stuff.  As for the fried noodles we all felt like it was handmade because of the doughiness of it and would definitely recommend this dish.    In the end, Chou's Kitchen gets my thumbs up.  I had a great experience here and the service was on top of it.  Our server was polite and attentive and I drink a lot of water when I eat and I gathered she saw that so she kept on coming to the table haha!  We loved our XLB so much we ordered second round of that stuff.  Next time I come I might just stick with that and the meat pies! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant with authentic Chinese food. The owner is super nice and makes me feel like home. My husband is not Asian but he loves this place. Some of our favorites are the beef pies, stir-fried pork stomach with jalapeño, and the pickled cabbage with pork and frozen tofu soup. We go here so often now they know us lol."}
{"text":"One of the best places to have authentic northern Chinese dishes. I love it. The environment is like back home."}
{"text":"Being an Uber driver is a good way to find ethnic restaurants that are recommendable, particularly if you drive students around to and from ASU. I was told I needed to leave Tempe to find good Chinese food. There are enough Asian people dining in here to know this place must be pretty authentic. Food is very good with some menu items I'm not accustomed to seeing at other Chinese restaurants.   This place has limited seating and the confines are tight. Service can also be very, very poor.  I once waited 45 minutes for an entree and although the Cumin Lamb was very good, it took 45 minutes to receive. Some servers also don't speak very good English and the drink menu is very limited.  I'd eat here again but I'd probably avoid going on a weekend."}
{"text":"I ordered takeaway.  The beef fried rice was great. The proportion was excellent. I definitely will frequent this place."}
{"text":"Family friendly, affordable and best of all the food is amazing!!!! I ordered the Spicy Fried Chicken and the Family Style Tofu. The Beef pies or buns are savory!"}
{"text":"Kind of disappointing. The menu looked really good and the reviews were good. The food took a long time to come out and it all came out individually so we couldn't eat it together. The rice was very moist and left a thick feeling in your mouth. The chicken had more fried edges than actual meat. We ordered fried rice and it smelled and tasted like burnt electrical wires. We couldn't eat it. We ordered spring rolls and they were the best part; we were so turned off by the rest of the food we couldn't finish the spring rolls. Don't think we will be coming back here which is a shame because it has a good location."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner, had the cold tripe dish, toothpick lamb, soup dumpling, and a noodle dish. The only thing I liked here was the soup dumplings. Everything else was either salty or tasteless.   They also need to reevaluate their service. The only attentive personnel here was their Hispanic table cleaner / server.    I consider this place overhyped..  J out."}
{"text":"My bf wanted Chinese food for his bday and we've been looking for a new place in our area.  Checked Yelp and this new place popped up.  Super packed on a Friday night and service was awesome from the get go.  We were greeted by about 3 different people right when we walked in.   We ordered some pork dumplings to start (I can't remember which exact ones), Mongolian beef, sweet and sour chicken and vegetable fried rice.  I unfortunately wasn't a huge fan of the dumplings.  Apparently they are super popular here but I just wasn't a big fan of the taste.  The Mongolian beef and sweet and sour chicken were both delicious!  The meat was well cooked and super tender and flavorful.   The star of the meal was the veggie fried rice.  I'll be honest, when it was brought to the table I wasn't impressed.  It looked a little bland and unassuming.  But once I tried it, omg it was packed with flavor!  It was by far my favorite part of the meal.   Really awesome place, I'm glad they set up shop in Tempe.  The staff are all very friendly and the owner came by to check on us and fill up our drinks.  Excited to go back!!"}
{"text":"OMGILOVETHISPLACE.   Northern Chinese cuisine is not prevalent in the US and it is the food of my family. So every time I'm sick and mopey my lovely Chan-cakes will make the trek from the North 'dale to Chandler to get me some meat pies, eggplant, and sour cabbage soup.   Now let me talk about the sour cabbage soup. Sour cabbage is the north Chinese equivalent of sauerkraut. It is made with Napa cabbage and is traditionally buried in dirt as part of the fermentation process. When I was little I used to watch my grandmother fill jars and jars of this stuff and it would stink up her kitchen for months. It is my absolute favorite food and it is magnificent and cures all of the home sickness. Get it with pork and frozen tofu. When tofu is frozen and defrosted the texture turns spongey and it soaks up all of the brothy goodness. If you are brave enough to order this dish, you have a special place in my heart.   For those of you who gagged a little at the words \"sour\" and \"cabbage\" side by side, try their sweet and sour pork. The Northerners make it differently than your average China Wok. The meat is flattened and deep fried then drenched in a sauce that's a little thicker and more sour than the normal red sauce.  It is also fantastic cold at 1am and cures the heaviest of munchies.   Oh, and do yourself a favor and order one of their meat pies. Do you know how delightful it is to bite into a crispy vinegar-soaked meat pie? Did you make a teeny bite like I did then drink up the meat juices? If so, see above for the special place in my heart for people who ordered the sour cabbage soup. This is the ultimate food porn.   One last thing. The lamb skewers. This I don't always order because I'm usually too full from all of the above.  But if you want to know what the streets of the North smell like on the coldest of winter days, this is it. Back in the homeland, nothing filled this little piggy with more delight than this street meat delicacy. You know it's real authentic because there is so much msg goodness in these meats and the skewers are dangerously sharp. Get two orders, because you'll want more."}
{"text":"Yo this place is the freaking bomb. The food is delish bruh! But, watch out for which soy sauce bottle you're pouring on your rice. One is soy sauce and the other is VINEGAR! They're both in soy sauce bottles but the vinegar one has a tiny white tag on the top saying \"vinegar\". Other than that you're in the freaking clear fam. Dankypants food tho you won't regret eating anything here except for RICE WITH VINEGAR IN IT!"}
{"text":"This place was very tasty. They have a good variety of food options. We were able to find my meat and potatoes dad something he would eat and there were plenty of more exotic looking items on the menu as well. I was a little disappointed in my noodles, but only because I think my party's chicken stir fry dishes were so good! The service is a little slow and my boyfriend was well into his meal by the time mine came out, but overall very decent."}
{"text":"Amazing authentic Chinese food. The steamed pork dumplings, eggplant with minced pork, beef in chili oil are my favorites.  The service is friendly and fast."}
{"text":"This little Chinese Restaurant is a great example of why there are almost 41,000 Chinese Restaurants in the U. S. (Chinese Restaurant News). That is more locations than McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's and Taco Bell COMBINED! You can't please everyone!  In four visits I have been pleased by each and am now a \"Regular.\" The most pleasing of their dishes that I have tried are:                Cold Spicy Noodles and Cucumbers -  BEST Noodle Dish I have EVER                had! Almost addictive!                Dumplings of Any Kind - (Ask for \"Soup Dumplings\" - XLB = Xiao Long                Bao, NOT on the menu but THE BEST!)                Chicken Fried Rice- FABULOUS!                Orange Chicken -  consider putting it over that Fried Rice.               Beef or Pork Pies - A bit disappointing, given the hype, but Good               Pot Stickers - Not as well done as I like, but GOOD!)   I was disappointed in the Chive or Green Onion Pancakes, but others rave about them.  A gem of a find to be certain!"}
{"text":"I had the Beef Stew with noodles. It was very tasty.  The noodles were fresh and yummy, and the beef chunks and broth were very mouthwatering.  I also tried the beef buns. They were delicious, The pastry was freshly made and very meaty inside. I dipped then in the stew. I was full and satisfied.        The server was very nice and helped me order since I was not familiar with this cuisine. Her picks were very good. I want to go back since there are many things on the menu I would still like to try. The place is not fancy and it's not the dark romantic atmosphere I normally like, but the food makes up for all that, and it's affordable. I highly recommend it! Another great Yelp find for me! Score!"}
{"text":"It's really a poo. We've waited more than 1 HOUR to order, and the food is disgusting. After then, we are forced to add tips!!! I wonder how this restaurant can exist so long time and receive so many positive feedbacks. It's totally a joke."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the Beef Stew Noodle Soup here.  It was very delicious.  I cannot wait to try the other soups.  The Meat Pies and Buns were good, but not my favorite.  The staff is very friendly and the food is fresh.  It's a lot better than most Chinese places and this one others a lot of different types of Chinese food.  It was a nice change."}
{"text":"Lots of parking, lot of tables (different group sizes), and clean.  The staff was very attentive and friendly.  Plus we had someone with us that spoke the language (PLUS).  Ok, so what didn't we order...  We order three different dumplings (fish, seafood combo, and pork), beef pies, beef noodle soup, etc.  I have to say everything was very very good.  The taste was there, textures in the dumplings & noodles, etc.  YUM!  5 of us polished off A LOT OF food but still had leftovers to take home."}
{"text":"My mom picked this place for her birthday lunch.  We drove 50 mins (1 way).  It was a little place stuck in a strip mall.  We were greeted right away.  The staff was super friendly.  Before we ordered, the server brought waters and these yellow soups.  I have never seen yellow soup before, so like a little kid, MOM - What is this???  She told me it was a corn congee-like soup.  It was tasteless but then I found it you put sugar it in.  Ah, I just I am a Northern Style Chinese food newbie.  Since I have no idea, I left it up to my parents to order the food.    Beef Pies - Excellent!!!  Very tasty and yummy. Pork Potstickers -  Freshly made and cooked.  These are very good.  But found out Northern style, you do not use soy sauce for dipping sauce.  Vinegar is the thing. Green Onion Pancakes -  It was fresh but the layers of dough were not there.  OK. Fried Beef Bun - These are actually steamed.  Doughy but good. Lamb Skewers - My family inhaled them.  And said it was great.   Spicy Pork Intestines Stir Fry - Again my family ate it and said it was good.  I am the only person in my family that is not that brave.    1 con:  It was super HOT!  I was sweating the entire lunch.  Please turn on the AC!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best Chinese place I've found in the metro Phoenix area.   Everything was obviously homemade and fresh and authentic.   We had the beef noodle soup, which was awesome, the pan fried pot stickers, soup dumplings, chive pancakes, and beef pies.   Our favorite thing was the beef pies but everything was awesome.   Seriously, we will be back REALLY soon because it was great.   Check this place out."}
{"text":"Why can't they have this place in Glendale? I have to drive 50 min there and back and it is so worth it because this is the best Chinese food I've had in the Phoenix area. Let's get down to business. FOOD! I haven't tried nearly enough things on the menu that I would like to try. Skip the free corn meal soup as you do not want to waste any stomach capacity. Beef pies are juicy in the best way possible. Beef noodle soup tastes as authentic and flavorful as I've had. The broth is TO DIE FOR. Green onion pancakes are decent. I enjoyed the spicy bean curd appetizer. And for you vegetarians out there, the stir fry potato jalapeno and eggplant was excellent. Even my boyfriend loves it and he thinks Panda Express is good Chinese food... eh. Speaking of, if you're the type of person who only orders orange chicken and fried rice at Chinese places, you might want to skip this place and go straight to the mall food court...just a suggestion. SERVICE. I love the really tall woman who works here! She cracks me up every time I come in and always has a big smile on her face. Chinese places sometimes receive a bad rep for having terrible service but Chou's Kitchen is warm and fun. Definitely try this place if you're craving authentic northern Chinese food."}
{"text":"I have been an Arizona resident for about a year now, and was unable to find any good Chinese restaurants.  Growing up in DC, Boston, and NYC, my standards- of course- were high.  With Chou's Kitchen, I finally found a staple to our restaurant rotation.  Excellent traditional food, rock bottom prices, and very friendly/authentic service.  Not a lot of frills in the restaurant itself, but you can see into the kitchen and the dumpling prep station which makes you feel better about the cleanliness.  I do think they can do a better job turning around tables once people are done.  Also, there isn't a lot of seating area.  If you have a party larger than 6, you'll probably need to break out to additional tables.  Have had many things on the menu, and everything has been excellent."}
{"text":"Best Chinese restaurant in town. We had business trip and stop by here. Really good long list of good choices. Good service. Good food."}
{"text":"Wanted to bring home some food for the in laws over some dinner and decided on Chou's Kitchen. Ended up picking up the spicy pig intestine stir fry, some frozen soup dumplings and the beef pies.   All were absolutely delicious (my favorite was the spicy pig intestines). I was surprised that the soup dumplings were so good after being frozen but they definitely know how to make them. Just like they told me, 15 minutes to steam it, and it's ready to eat.  Overall, one of the most authentic things I've ever had. Hit up Chou's if you want to grab some soup dumplings or spicy pig intestine stir fry. Oh and the beef pies were deliciously juicy too :)."}
{"text":"Even though it was quite a trek for us to get here, after reading about this restaurant's soup dumplings in '100 Favorite Dishes of 2015' in the New Times, I was very much excited to try them. I have tasted authentic and absolutely delicious versions in LA and Chicago, so I couldn't wait to see if this locale would deliver against such a tough premise.   The xiaolongbaos were absolutely as good as advertised! The 8 little pieces of heaven came out piping hot and the consistency was perfect for scooping up with a spoon (chopsticks if you're feeling brave). That moment when the dumpling breaks open in your mouth and the soup explodes amongst your tastebuds.....................sorry, I had to clean off some drool from my keyboard.   The 80% score comes from their not-so scrumptious complimentary soup (but hey, it was free) and the lackluster spicy garlic eggplant dish. Yes, it's not the type of cuisine they specialize in, but the dish really lacked seasoning. After such a stellar appetizer, the meal just fell flat.  No doubt I'll be back for more xlbs though!"}
{"text":"Food is probably the most authentic of all the places I tried in the PHX area.  Xiaolongbao is alright, but the flour cover is thick vs. skinny at Ding Tai Fung. The soy sauce they use here is a bit strong.   Service is a bit lacking.    Still one of the better Chinese food here in PHX."}
{"text":"This place is good for the juicy pork dumplings if you're craving bao! The other food is pretty good. I'd only recommend it for the Baos honestly. Other than that, the restaurant was so clean and the customer service was amazing!"}
{"text":"This is a small, no frills, family run restaurant tucked away in a strip mall in Chandler. But the food is impressive! We were on the hunt for really good potstickers and this is now our favorite. The menu is extensive, from the potstickers to the delicious meat pies, yummy noodle dishes to stir fry, mild to spicy. And most of the time they can modify the dish to your liking. The food served here is from the northeastern China region and is called Dongbei. The best part of the whole Chou's experience is the attention to detail and quality of food. Everyone is treated as family and you can feel it when you walk in. If you're hungry for great Asian food, try it today."}
{"text":"We were in the area for a couple of doctor's appointments and were looking for a place for lunch. Not knowing what was around we rely on Yelp reviews to find this place and we were not disappointed.  The place is small and the service was friendly. And you know it is authentic when you walk in and the customer base is Chinese and the server greets you in Chinese... Anyway it was a great meal. We do live too far to come back frequently but we will be back."}
{"text":"My second favorite chinese place (great Wall on the west side is first) but by far the best in Tempe! Been here three times and always want to come back  Great food fair price"}
{"text":"Just returned from a trip to San Francisco and I couldn't get the amazing dumplings I had there out of my head. I'm so happy this place is close by!  We ordered the pork and shrimp dumplings, onion pancake, beef stir fry noodles, meat pies and...XLB!  Yes folks, they have XLB (soup dumplings) here, which is my favorite. It's not on the menu but they will make it if you order it. That bumped my rating from a 4 to 5 star.  My kids also enjoyed watching the ladies hand make the dumplings.  Bottom line, the food here is authentic and delicious. They take pride in it. Customer service is warm and friendly and our food came out fast. And it's cheap! None of the dishes we ordered were over $8.  Great spot. Now, it's not the best northern Chinese food I've ever had, but it's pretty top notch for Phoenix. I anticipate being a regular!"}
{"text":"These darn Northerners really know how to make some goooood eggplant. I am obsessed, like seriously obsessed with their eggplant minced pork dish. it sounds so simple but never have I had it this good. Everything else on the menu is decent, the dumplings, XLB, noodles, etc., but the eggplant is to die for! Go for the authentic side of the menu avoid the Americanized dishes."}
{"text":"Having lived in SF and growing up in Chicago I don't know how Travel & Leisure came up with it being the \"Best Chinese Restaurant in the US\", but the food is definitely tasty.  Having so many dumpling choices though is definitely unique.  Our favorite is the beef pies.  It's almost like a flat xoa loa bow, because when you bite into it all this delicious juice is released.  We've been there twice and never found them to be greasy as one reviewer described.  The pot stickers and pork dumplings were also good although we prefer a thinner, less doughy wrapping.  Had a few of the other items on the menu and were not disappointed.  The place is tiny and can get crowded rather quickly.  The service can be less than stellar and they can get orders mixed up when they're really busy.  If you can overlook all of that, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"In my opinion the best orange chicken I had!! Great food, good service and clean bathrooms.  Will return with my family."}
{"text":"As a New Yorker I pride myself in being to distinguish between good and bad Chinese food. The dumplings were great. We ordered a ton of food! The soup tasted like dirty water, didn't eat it. The beef and broccoli was great, I loved it. Everything seemed to be alright until I was going to pay to leave. And just as I picked up my purse, a ROACH crawled up the wall. It ruined my entire experience. I threw away all of the leftovers and just tried to forget it. It's a real shame BC they're food is decent considering it's in Arizona."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to eating here based on all the reviews. But my husband and I were really disapointed. The food was just okay. The oft raved about dumplings were so greasy we could hardly eat them. We tried a wide variety of food, but nothing really wowed us.    I forgot to add that while we were sitting there a cockroach ran across the floor. O.o"}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place out and I just walked in the pick up menu and I got some really rude service , very unfriendly asians!! Would never eat there now after that crummy attitude!!"}
{"text":"Our room mate recommended this place. We ordered sweet n sour ribs, stir fried beans, egg plant potatoes and green pepper, and pork dim sum. My favorite is pork dim sum. Will go back try other things"}
{"text":"This place is super authentic. Some of my Chinese recommended me this place, so I have been to this place 3-4 times and I liked most of foods. Especially I love pig ear( cold dish) , buns, and liang-pi. They have hand made dumplings and it's also pretty good!!!"}
{"text":"Homemade Chinese food!  Love it.  In a random strip mall in a totally unassuming area, but the place is very clean, food authentic and when we were there the ladies were making homemade dumplings right by our table.  I liked the dumplings, eggplant, and the noodles.  I'll be back again."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! The place is small seating-wise so we opted for takeout. Ordered Kung pao chicken, shrimp fried rice, chicken friend rice, pork dumplings, veggie rolls and cold noodles with sesame and peanut sauce. Large portion sizes. We had way more food than expected. Kung pao chicken wasn't as spicy as I thought it would be, but it was still good. My favorite were the cold sesame and peanut noodles. Incredible. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Somehow, all conversations in my office end up at food--things we like, things we hate... and I am so grateful, because that is how I heard about Chou's Kitchen!  We got a huge takeout feast of the cucumber with garlic sauce, salad with Green Onion, Cilantro & Jalapeno, szechuan spicy beef, and the cabbage with pork & vermicelli clay pot.  The cucumber dish was refreshing, and the salad had so many yummy ingredients (wood ear, bean curd shreds, and the aforementioned cilantro, green onion, and jalapeno) in a fresh dressing. One note is that it has a few szechuan peppercorns, so you get that numbing sensation (which I personally don't particular like, but to each their own!)  The spicy beef also had the Szechuan peppercorns, but the beef was crispy and dry, so it was easy for me to pick off peppercorns so I wouldn't get too much of the numbing, while still getting all of the hot! The clay pot dish was absolutely perfect, and reminded me of home. I'll definitely be going back to Chou's sooner rather than later--this time for dumplings!!!"}
{"text":"My first visit was on January 25, 2015. I came in with a large group and my warning (especially on Sundays) is that seating is competitive. Two late members of our group couldn't get past the line waiting to get inside. Otherwise, it was quiet until mass conversation by the customers. The person in our group that is a recurring customer ordered by going to the back and telling the waitresses what he wanted (good thing I wasn't the one ordering). I ordered cold soy milk (drink wisely, it goes fast). It was paired with a sort of crunchy fried doughnut that usually goes better with warm soy milk. I ordered Mongolian Beef (it was good). My favorite was the green onion pancakes."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with the work crowd, We ordered a variety of food and it was all good!"}
{"text":"Love it!  This place reminds me of the Dim Sum I had in China!  This place is legit!"}
{"text":"I have just made a list of 9 more items I would like to try. If I really could convey how good this restaurant is I would never be able you get a table.  I have been called a foodie and a food snob which is all pretty true. This little family owned restaurant amazed me with the flavors. This is now my favorite place to eat. I have been looking for people to take there just so I can sample what they order. I belong to a lunch club and we have been trying new restaurants for three years now and Chou's Kitchen has been the jewel.  Trust me you will love Chou's Kitchen."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  The pot stickers, onion pancake and the pork patty are my favorite dishes.  Everything is really fresh.    The owner is really friendly and will help explain dishes to you that you might have questions on.  I have also gotten the frozen pot stickers to take home and they were good too."}
{"text":"Sunny was so friendly and the food was beyond wonderful. It's worth the drive from N. Phoenix to Chandler. Clay pot was divine and I had leftovers for 2 days."}
{"text":"Tried the Mongolian beef and the juicy pork dumplings.. so so good. Great service. Quiet at 7pm on a Sunday night, perfect spot, just wish there was one in west phoenix. Easily best Chinese food I've had in AZ.. and I'm a food loving local. Will be back for more of those mouth watering pork dumplings!"}
{"text":"Chou's kitchen is a nice little Chinese restaurant that specializes in food from the Dong bei or north eastern part of China. The foods are generally things like dumplings, the beef/pork pie, spicy lamb skewers, green onion pancakes, sour cabbage soup and many other foods that are similar to the items listed above.   Must orders: lamb skewers and either the beef or pork pie Highly recommended: green onion pancakes, pan fried chive dumpling, dumplings/pot stickers, Xiao long bao, sour cabbage soup  Most of my recommendations are appetizer sized so order one or order a few! The meat pies come in 3's"}
{"text":"This is the closest thing to authentic tasting Chinese I've found in Tempe. The mapo tofu is AMAZING. The wonton soup is the best I've ever had. The Kung pao chicken is the best I've ever had. Seriously everything I've eaten here is the best I've ever had , with the exception of the mapo tofu because I've eaten it at another restaurant in Houston, Tx and it was the same quality. If you are looking for very Americanized Chinese food look elsewhere, but if you want the real deal this is the place to go. The staff is also very friendly and the restaurant is clean."}
{"text":"Best Chinese Food I've had in Arizona to date.  Actually reminded me of a place I eat at in San Francisco.    Thanks to yelp I happened upon this place.  I'd been by and around this place for quite a while but because of it being in a strip mall down from the American Legion Post I just never thought to try it.  It did always smell good however.  Ok so after reading the reviews I took my wife there since we both love trying new restaurants and food.  The service was very good, quick and informative.  I tried to order the LARGE Hot and Sour soup and she said the small was enough.  Was it ever.  More than enough for two and delicious.  It wasn't as spicy as I'd normally like but the freshness and flavor were spot on.  A little pepper and chili oil and I was in heaven.  We ordered the eggplant with minced pork and garlic sauce, house fried noodles which have shrimp, pork, chicken and beef and pork dumplings.  This along with the soup was like 33-34 which is very reasonable and we enjoyed absolutely everything.  Fresh Fresh Fresh.  We ordered take out and drove out of our way to pick up and it was just as good.  FYI since the noodles are homemade they can get sticky if you don't eat them right away."}
{"text":"Every table was occupied, and the entire time we were there we only saw one white person (other that us). Enough said.   Ok, I'll say a bit more. The food was on the pricey side of Chinese food ($9-$12), but SO worth it. Quite a selection of dumpling-type things that don't translate well to English. Kind of like dim sum but definitely a northeastern flavor. In fact, if you are a fan of the light and bland flavors the Cantonese fare served in most Chinese Restaurants in the US, this place might shock you. The flavors are deep and intense and very authentic.   We'll definitely go back at least 4 or 5 more times because there were so many items on the menu that we were dying to try. Hint: go with a group so you can order more dishes and sample more!  The environment was nice and clean, and the service was very friendly and responsive."}
{"text":"Best Chinese I've had in Az.  Very authentic.  Not fancy in terms of a restaurant but the food is unreal"}
{"text":"The food is good, but they seem to be really rude to white people. There are always a lot of Chinese diners and when we go they ignore us and everyone else gets served first even if they came in after us. I've heard the same from others who have dined there. We recommended it to a visiting friend who said the same. Won't be recommending again."}
{"text":"Chou's kitchen is really yummy !! it's juicy dumplings are soooooooooo delicous !!!!!!!also it was pretty cheap and this one worker is so efficient she is amazing"}
{"text":"YEEEEEEESSSSS. Finally, some awesome soup dumplings in Phoenix!!! Not some chewy-skinned dried up semblance of one, which I have found at other Chinese restaurants.   The moment we sat down, we ordered some xiaolongbao while we perused the menu. Our main goal was to eat soup dumplings, so we just ordered a beef/vegetable noodle entree as a complementary dish. The noodles were fine, nothing special.   As we awaited our first order of xiaolongbao, we enjoyed watching one of the ladies hand make the dumplings at the counter. It only increased our anticipation. When the dumplings finally came out with vinegar + ginger, I was so happy! You can be certain no other place I tried in Phoenix automatically brought this sauce out--I  would have to ask for vinegar separately!  They tasted great. Is it the best xiaolongbao I've ever had? No, but they were damn good regardless and certainly the best I've had in Phoenix. The broth in the dumpling was very savory, the skin wasn't too thick or dry and the filling was delicious.  Their entrees are reasonably priced too. We'll be back :) Thank you Chou's Kitchen!"}
{"text":"hot and sour soup tastes like the kind of soup I used to eat in Boston's Chinatown. Not the most amazing Chinese I've had but not the worst. I will be coming back for the soup though!"}
{"text":"Have tried it a few times and definitely good Chinese food. Very good and just what I'd expect (my point of reference is SF Chinatown). Tried the different dumplings and as others note - they are FRESH!  You can actually watch them making these items. Unfortunately I'm not that into the steamed ones as they are too much dough for my palette. But that's my preference, nothing wrong with the food. Pot stickers are great.  I need to check out a few more menu items in order to say it's great. Some regulars had an interesting dish that caused me some entrée envy - definitely gonna give that a shot next time.  Place is not huge but I've never had a problem getting a seat. Food is at least 4 stars but service leaves a bit to be desired, so rating 3 stars. Waitstaff I've had just don't even bother to try and connect (except to the regulars I mentioned - they got a LOT of attention). And our last waiter's apron looked like he was in the back cooking! Would show up, slap our dishes down and then disappear. Didn't look like it was isolated to us as I noticed a few other tables having a similar problem getting his attention.  All-in-all it is a good place. Much better than most any other Chinese I've tried in the Chandler area. Yeah, that's not saying much, I know..."}
{"text":"From someone really picky about their Chinese food, Chou's is the most authentic I've found in Arizona. Plus it's the only place you can get xiaolongbao (juicy pork dumplings). The wait staff is really friendly, despite the fact that there can be long waits when it's really crowded, it's expected and not a place to rush your food!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for lunch on a Tuesday. It was later in the afternoon, probably around 2pm. The place wasn't that busy, which was fine by us. We were seated immediately and our food came out rather quickly. (Since we were the only ones in the restaurant.) We ordered three different items:  Fried pork buns - just okay. I thought they were a little greasy but my husband liked them. Beef pie - tasty. I really liked these and so did my husband.  Meatball and cabbage hot pot - delicious! This was actually my favorite.  We took a little bit of each as leftovers and my sister-in-law really liked everything as well. Overall, I thought the food and service were very good. If I'm in the area, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Amazing homemade dumping and dishes! 5 stars for sure! we absolutely love Chou's kitchen!"}
{"text":"I ordered the ants on the log which I thought would be like a dan dan but it's was the clear cellophane noodles and for me it wasn't my thing. That said, the place was packed and so many of the dishes looked amazing. I will certainly go back to try something different."}
{"text":"BEST Chinese place in Arizona! I come here so much that the owner knows me and my family. The pork fried rice, chicken and string beans and juicy pork dumplings are amazing!! Here at least once a week"}
{"text":"So so glad I decided to come to Chou's. Potstickers - dying. #120 steamed pork dumplings - really good. Kung Po chicken - the best I've literally ever had.   I had been lamenting the lack of really good & authentic chinese places in the area but this place is amazing. I'll be back very very soon."}
{"text":"When your 6 foot chinese friend says I have a place I want you to try you go. This is your typical Asian place small the smell of garlic and onions cooking. They are known for their dumpling and they are perfect.  They make them all homemade and we got the steamed one, most times when I've gotten them other places  there is  moisture that makes them soggy not this place. The food is authenic and I can't wait to try more dumplings.  While we were there there was a table of people who made it very clear there weren't happy with something they ordered.  It's a Friday night at 7pm yes every place is busy yes this place is small and there were two young ladies trying to keep with the rush.  This table were rude loud and making a scene the lady I didn't catch her name but had glasses kept her composure the best she could and continued to work even though you could see she was upset she offered to contact the owner to which this table replied oh we know  her I wanted to speak up for her as they were being mean and ruining my dinner but I watched as this young lady pushed through."}
{"text":"This is some of the best Chinese I have had. We go there at least once a week for lunch. I never had anything bad. Service is great!   Price is great.   Try the shrimp fried noodle K05. My favorite."}
{"text":"Chou's Kitchen has an extensive menu of appetizers, entrees, soups, noodles and clay pots. Their dumplings (xiao long bao) are the real reason we chose to try Chou's in the first place, as those are pretty hard to come by in Arizona, and they're what keep us going back. The pork Xiao Long Bao (soup dumplings) are hot and flavorful, filled with soup broth and meat. They're not the best XLB out there, but definitely a must-try and worth stopping in for, whether you're in Tempe or Chandler! We also ordered the beef pies and wanted to try an entree and opted for the orange chicken. The orange chicken was good, nothing too special, but the beef pies are amazing! They're served in threes and are juicy and bursting with flavor.   Their handmade appetizers are more than enough for a meal and they make for a great experience. Their prices aren't terrible and takeout is quick and easy if you aren't looking to dine in. Chou's Kitchen is definitely worth checking out and is our go-to for dumplings!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Mongolian beef and pot stickers....   The Mongolian beef much like at 99% of all Chinese restaurants says its spicy but its no where near spicy.. More salty then spicy for sure, but still tasty......  The pot stickers along with all the other appetizers are handmade and delicious! They have a little station in where the apps are handmade right in front of ya.. Pot stickers were delicious.  Service was on par..... Kept my water glass filled and checked me out quickly."}
{"text":"Love the food! I had the Chicken Veggie delight & my coworker the King Pao Chicken. Coming from 2 Asians--this is an authentic Chinese Restaurant  Potstickers are made fresh! I'll definitely be visiting this place again.  I've been back 3 times now. Never disappointed"}
{"text":"The food was delicious here and the service was great. I ordered the potatoes and eggplant dish and it was sweet and tasted great! We also had the stir fry pork intestine (their special) and it was sooooo good. I would recommend these two dishes. We also ordered the cold jelly salad dish and did not really like it though."}
{"text":"We did not have good experiences with Chou's Kitchen.  Upon realizing that this location was a 5-minute walk, it seemed like a good place to frequent for lunch.  Service on our first visit was mediocre.  Despite the two of us ordering the exact same dish, we had a 10-minute window between the first and second entree coming out.  Our second trip to Chou's Kitchen was terrible in that we waited 15 minutes to be seen for the first time, had to wave down the waitress to order, had to get up and walk to the front for a refill and she forgot one of our orders.  An attitude was given to us after we approached the staff for refills and the check.  What was particularly awful about this visit was that every other table was receiving quick service and we, the only caucasians in the place, were receiving little to no attention at all.  The exact same mistake happening on two separate occasions is not a coincidence.  Chou's Kitchen's service is biased and does not provide the same service to all types of customers."}
{"text":"What a treat!  I have had Chinese food all over this state in the past 4+decades and this is the most unique I have ever had.    The service is old school...meaning they actually make eye contact the second you enter the business, smile, and invite you to take a table.    Service is prompt and efficient.  The owner came to our table to take our order the first time we came assuming ,correctly, that as newbies we might have more questions than the regulars.  She was very pleasant and helpful.    On my second visit, the same lady recognized me as having been there before and even recalled some of my first order.  Impressive given the number of customers in this place at any given time.  She also ended my last visit with a recommendation of a dish I should try next time.    Wonderful to be treated with such genuine consideration.  First off, it's important to note for those who don't like hot food that the \"jalapeno\" ingredient is actually the much more mild Anaheim chili.  This ingredient more commonly, in my experience, found in Mexican food makes an incredible addition to these Chinese dishes.  In order my favorites are/were:    #5 Salad with green onion, cilantro and Jalapeno.  The tofu noodles and raw peanuts transport this dish out of the \"salad\" category and into the meal category for me.  #50 Eggplant with potatoes and jalapeno.  This dish is unlike anything I have experienced.  It packs an impressive flavor while not swimming in any puddled sauce.  Potatoes in Chinese food?    It's magic. Who knew!!  #79 Green onion pancakes.  Just exactly the flavor I was seeking.  Think of an authentic moo shu pancake only much thicker, studded with green onions and pan fried to a savory golden brown.  Delicious.  #68 Mongolian beef -  While not as spicy as some it was fresh and delicious.  Chicken skewers, grilled with a savory and smoky taste.  Not spicy and very good.  #82 Dumplings with pork and napa cabbage - very fresh and subtlety seasoned  #61 Spinach with garlic sauce -  To be fair spinach isn't the best vegetable for stir-fry, in my opinion.  The high water content  tends to leave you with steamed spinach in the end regardless of your best efforts.  Having said that, it was damn good steamed spinach!  #1 Green Bean Jelly with Vegetables, Ham and eggs -   The presentation alone made it worth while.  However, the dressing for this noodle (which is what the green bean jelly resembles) Cobb salad was incendiary with Horseradish.  Seriously.  I don't know if it was an error or if the Northeaster Chinese are made of sterner stuff than myself but WOW!    All in all this place is a gem and is not to be missed."}
{"text":"This restaurant has good food, but is very loud. The staff talks loud. I have had better food and much better service, our waiter was new so it was okay that he got my dish wrong. He gave me shrimp chop suet but the shrimp tasted freezer burnt and was very dry, I had ordered pork."}
{"text":"I am glad I gave it a second chance since the first time I found it to be mediocre. Now I am a regular.  The first time I ordered the shrimp & vegetables and the xiao long bao. I was disappointed in the Xiao Long Bao, but once you've been to Din Tai Fung it's hard to find some as delicious. It tasted bland and did not contain much soup inside. However, I tried it again more recently and they were delicious! It most likely just depends who is doing the cooking that day.  The Szechuan Spicy Beef (#50) is fantastic! Not super spicy but very flavorful. I also think the chicken version (Szechuan Spicy Chicken) is just as good.   Service Experience: They've improved. The booths have buttons you can press if you need the servers to come to your table. Very quick and nice. Sometimes I think maybe a little too quick though. I would like a little more time to look at the menu before they come and ask for my order."}
{"text":"4.5/5 Stars  I am a fan of Chou's Kitchen in Tempe, and now I am a fan of the one in Chandler also. The seating and ambiance of the Chandler location seems more comfortable and relaxed than its Tempe counterpart.  The restaurant was clean and the staff was friendly. I enjoyed being able to watch the food being made. I have 0 complaints about the service and location. The reason I docked it .5 is because of the food.  The food was pretty good. We ordered a fish dish (Stir Fry Spicy Fish Fillet, I think), which was amazing, and the Shandong Da-Lu Noodle Soup. The noodle soup dish was bland, unfortunately.   Overall the food is pretty good and the place is very enjoyable. I would definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"Excellent. Ordered juicy steamed pork dumplings, cucumbers with garlic, pork with onions and jalepeno, mustard greens with garlic, beef pie and there dumplings. Best Chinese food in the valley!"}
{"text":"On Chinese New Year I craved chinese.. go figure.   Once again Yelp has not let me down. I got the beef noodle soup and Hubby got the spicy chicken and we split dumplings. When you walk in and you see someone hand making the dumplings then you know its going to be good....  The soup taste like your Chinese grandma's comfort food. It warms the soul, for real. And the dumplings?!?!!? yes....  Now the place isn't very big or super fancy but that's what I expect from a place with amazing food. Home style asian restaurant stuff... sorry I'm from the Bay Area in California and that's what I'm used to.   Plus the price is amazing!!!   Over all I'd say : shut up and take my money! Its a five star for sure."}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend and his Chinese friend - mainly because his friend was feeling homesick, so we decided to treat him out and took him to a Chinese restaurant (a place that he can feel like home.)   The service was good. The waitress was very helpful and patient with us.. since it was our first time there. My boyfriend and I don't usually eat Chinese food much, so we didn't know what to get. Overall, the food were great and surprisingly cheap imo.   Definitely coming back! :)"}
{"text":"This place is the best for Chinese food, the Mongolian Beef is awesome!  Not even one fortune cookie with a take out order.  No napkins...   I did ask for a chopstick"}
{"text":"I was really excited about eating here since I read so many great reviews here on Yelp about the place, but after going there, I would have to that I am disappointed and there's nothing great about the food that would make me want to come back again.    The service was really lousy.  We were the only family here eating and it was so slow, they didn't refill our drinks, and it seemed like they forgot there was even a family that had ordered.  The family or workers were just like hanging out and we were hungry.  We know what good Chinese food is because we are Chinese, immigrated and first generation here and have had plenty of authentic, delicious Chinese food.  Being that I thought this was northern Chinese food, I would say it doesn't even come close to tasting anything like that in the Silicon Valley or Southern CA area.  I've been longing for a place that has good Northern Chinese food, but the restaurants we used to go to, a couple in the valley, went out of business.  So, right now, the only place to possibly satisfy my northern food taste is to go to CA or maybe to Las Vegas.  I guess I also didn't expect great service being that it was Chinese catering to Chinese, but even for me, is was below subpar.  The food and service isn't enough for me to come back again."}
{"text":"I had the pork fried buns and the scallion pancakes. They were both just amazing. I had never had NE Chinese food before, but had seen a TV show featuring the food, so I knew roughly what to expect. It's very hearty, very tasty, and is very obviously handmade. The ladies behind the counter were both really nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Companion and I dropped in for dinner and enjoyed ourselves immensely. Because of health issues, companion was not able to drink any of the drinks on the menu, and the owner kindly allowed a drink to be brought in from the outside that was acceptable.  We had a minor communication problem in that we ordered soup dumplings and received a bowl of broth with dumplings swimming in it. After working out our communication, we were brought the real Shanghai soup dumplings and were told to also keep the regular dumplings at no charge. It must be said that the regular dumplings were wonderful and the broth they were in was beautifully clear and flavorful. As for the Shanghai soup dumplings, they were just as flavorful and totally delicious. Companion also ordered spring rolls which were nice and crispy, had good flavor, and were accompanied by a nice dipping sauce.  Companion ordered the Honey Shrimp which is a standard dish in many chinese restaurants, but this was a bit different. First of all, the food was cooked perfectly and second of all, if was not the cloyingly sweet item that most places serve. The sweetness was reserved allowing for truly tasting the shrimp and the broccoli  For myself, I ordered Szechuan style Ma Po Tofu, another dish which is available in almost any Chinese restaurant. Normally it is made with tsin tsin peppers, but here was a new twist on an old dish. Heat was supplied by jalapeno peppers, and to my great surprise by real Szechuan pepper corns. For those who have not had the experience of these wonderful pepper corns, they leave your tongue and mouth a bit numb after eating them, which is a true mark of real Szechuan food.  In the U.S. most places making this dish use ground up pork, but here they use actual chunks of meltingly tender meat. This was an altogether satisfying dish.  Portions were all large and prices were quite reasonable.  4 stars for excellent food, good portion size, and being very accommodating to the customers needs."}
{"text":"This place was really busy but I'm not sure why.  The food is boring, bland and everything is the same dull beige color, and we ordered 6 things for 3 people since it was our first time to this place. The service was really slow too.  The soup dumplings were ok, and were the best thing we ordered. Overall we left disappointed. There are definitely better Chinese places than this in Phoenix, not sure about Chandler."}
{"text":"The place looks like a mom and pop shop..nothing fancy but the food is really good! I love the beef noodle soup and their orange chicken! The potstickers and dumplings are also great! Overall a good place to have Chinese food!"}
{"text":"Ordered Pig ear, bean curd salad, vermicelli with ground pork, spicy chicken and pork and Napa cabbage dumplings. The chicken and vermicelli are pretty good but other dishes are just average or even below average. It used taste so much better before they opened the other location in Tempe. Guess they have more customers at the Tempe location and don't care about the chandler location as much. It's really a 3.5-star"}
{"text":"Pretty good Chinese. Had pork pies, pork and cabbage dumplings and garlic chicken. Chicken was VERY good. The sauce made the rest of the meal taste even better. I didn't think the dumplings or the pies were the best, though."}
{"text":"First time going there because of the reviews decided to go there and try it . I ordered the beef fried rice, stir fry beef noodle and the juicy pork dumpling. The food seemed delicious but when I tried it the food tasted very very salty and I could also taste salt on top of the food too like if it was sprinkled on top of the food, instead of getting full off of the food I got full off of water I may not come back again but if anyone would go and try it ask for moderate or lightly salted on your order."}
{"text":"I come here all the time. My favorite is the pork and Napa cabbage dumplings. The employees are friendly, funny, and so polite. They hnd make dumplings before your eyes at the front display counter. I can't go anywhere else now when I want Chinese. Fresh, delicious and always wonderful!!"}
{"text":"Same delicious food, new location! I was excited to hear that Chou's expanded their locations, opening up a second restaurant in Tempe. The restaurant seems more spacious and has better ambiance than the Chandler location, with more tables and decor.  We browsed through the menu and decided on the xiao long bao, eggplant with minced pork in garlic sauce, and mapo tofu. The eggplant and tofu came out first. The eggplant was tender with a slightly crisp outer layer from frying with a concentrated brown garlic sauce. The mapo tofu was light on ground meat, but had very fresh tasting tofu and a tongue numbing, flavorful sauce with Sichuan peppercorns. The xiao long bao came out piping hot, a pretty good rendition of this dish, holding the requisite savory broth hidden inside the small dumplings.   Service was good and we were checked up on as needed. Our server spoke both fluent English and Mandarin Chinese.   Overall 4.5/5. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Back when I was a kid and my mom liked to cook traditional Taiwanese and Chinese food, she would make lots of dumplings from scratch.  The dumplings they make here are very similar, and remind me of those days when I'd help her roll out the dough and fill the dumplings with meat/veggie mix.  They are cooked perfectly, and the meat inside is well seasoned and quite tasty.  We also tried some green onion pancake and beef roll for more fried type foods, and both were perfectly crispy on the outside.  Our total was ~$15 including tax.  Service was friendly, but we had to specifically ask for water since we hadn't had any by the time our first plate of food came in.  If you're looking for a good Northern Chinese style restaurant, leave your low-carb diet at the door and step into Chou's Kitchen!"}
{"text":"Been here hundred times. Yes. I am not exaggerating. I wonder why I haven't write review until now.   This is the first place I will consider when I need Chinese food. It's very traditional cozy environment like my home town restaurant. The food is great and staff are very friendly. Even the boss behind the glass window making the dumpling are always smiling. It's not a fancy restaurant, but the foods is really authentic and awesome.   Just to keep in mind that they are very popular and busy, so be prepare to wait if you are coming on Friday noon, or over the weekend.   It's your own fault, if you have waited for a long time to be seated.   ."}
{"text":"I primarily come here for the Xiao Long Bao, which is probably their best dish here. The beef pie and pan-fried dumplings were good, but overly greasy. The bean curd was overly salty.   Not the cleanest, but expected for a hole in the wall type of place. Decent, fast service."}
{"text":"Soup Dumplings. Let me just open with that.  We were watching 'The Layover' and Anthony was in Taipei. At one point he was eating soup dumplings, and as we watched we were thinking \"OooOOooOOohhh that looks delicious!!!\". Then he ate beef noodle soup, which is a Taipei staple, apparently. So after the episode, we were CRAVING what we'd just seen (because we're suggestible like that), and I realized that I knew JUST THE PLACE to come to for it. So we drove right over here, and we WERE NOT DISAPPOINTED. They have soup dumplings, they have beef noodles soup, and they have all of the other amazing things that I've come to love about this place.  Pro-tip:  Scoop a little bit of the black vinegar onto your spoon, pick up your soup dumpling and take a small bite out of the side of it. Let the juices ooze into the spoon, and slurp back the whole thing into your mouth. It's like a bowl of soup in your mouth- soup that makes you want to punch someone in their kidneys from ecstacy.  ... what?  .... just me....??"}
{"text":"This place is legit. Authentic Chinese food at a reasonable price right by the ASU campus. What more can an international student ask for? :) Happy customer right here."}
{"text":"Good dumplings and the beef pies. Dough made from scratch makes all the difference and the flavor is good too. The lions head meatballs were too fried and dry for my liking but the flavor was pretty good. Server was friendly and you gotta love the millet porridge they serve when you first sit down."}
{"text":"And what were the food critics of Travel & Leisure smoking when they voted Chou's \"Best Chinese Restaurants in the US\"? We've been hearing about this place for a year or so, everyone \"RAVES\" about the food. We finally read about it in the Travel & Leisure and gave it a shot today for lunch at 12:15 PM. Coming from NYC and dining at the best tiny holes in the wall, our expectations were high especially based on previous reviews read.  Customer service was very friendly, though a bit slow. Now onto the food review, I knew we were in trouble when I ordered hot tea and I opened the lid to see if the tea was ready and it was a tea bag instead of tea leaves, additionally the water that was delivered to the table had a horrible taste to it. We order: -  Hot and sour soup for 2, may have been the best part of our lunch, good, but didn't pack a punch on either spicy or sour. -  Beef Pies, what's all the hype, took a bite and got a mouthful of greasy juice, ground up mystery meat which was wrapped in a fried pancake. - Steamed dumplings with pork and napa cabbage, again OK, these may have been the best choice out of all the dumplings, they came out hot and were OK tasting. - Fried pork buns, horrible, doughy and the filling had no taste. - Orange Chicken, OK tasting, a little heavy on the batter and was not orange tasting enough.  All in all not a repeat visit in our book and certainly not a Travel & Leisure's \"Best Chinese Restaurants in the US\" vote from us."}
{"text":"Wow. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED w/Lamb skewers ($5 for \"3\") quantity & quality. Very small portion, pieces and a lot of fat/gristle, very little flavor. Greasy. I will not return."}
{"text":"Home style Chinese food. Good taste with reasonable price."}
{"text":"I tried this place for lunch during work one day. I really liked it! They have a good size menu and the staff is super friendly. They explained a lot of different things about how they get special ingredients shipped from overseas and how duck sauce is not traditional so they don't have it, lol. I did feel the portions were a bit small compared to other places I've been, paying similar prices but it was very tasty and I'd go back to try more for sure."}
{"text":"It's been such a long time since we've been to Chou's Kitchen and it was as good as we remembered.  Between the two of us, we shared the beef stir-fry noodle (#26) and an order of beef pies (#100). The beef stir-fry noodle is everything you'd expect, thankfully with an ample amount of sliced beef. The beef seemed a little tough this time, but hey, still good. The beef pies, ohmylord, are to die for. Okay, they're a little on the greasy side, by that I mean these pies are dripping with oil with every bite. Just don't think about what these are doing to your arteries and savor each bite. Stop thinking.  Also, there's always a bit of comedy we take away from each visit to Chou's. Like I remember having one of the waitresses ask politely if I needed a fork cause it apparently was pretty clear that my chopstick skills were not, as the kids say, on point. Also, this time around, when my hubby picked up our order of noodles and beef pies, the lady had asked if he needed chopsticks. Yes please, two chopsticks, he replied. And the lady smiled \"knowingly\" as if to say, haha two chopsticks, we know you're really eating this all by yourself. He told me about it when he got home and we had a good laugh but I think going forward I should probably start picking up the food with him."}
{"text":"Went here for the soup dumplings.  Pot stickers & won ton soup were my favorites. It's pretty good. Maybe need to order differently next time. Very cheap considering how much you get!"}
{"text":"Given that the Phoenix area isn't a hot spot for Chinese restaurants, I think this place stands out clearly above the rest. The xi long bao is pretty damn good and I usually go with the beef stir fry because it's who I am. I will say service has been spotty a couple times but not bad enough to keep me from coming back or giving them 5 stars! Great food and good prices."}
{"text":"Very pleased to find a true Chinese Mandarin and Northern cooking restaurant in Tempe.  (Their first location is in Chandler)  They do a very good job on the signature dishes, Xiao Lon Bao (little soup buns), Pot stickers, Braised egg plants and spicy beef and many more.  Good portion and quality.    Restaurant is conveniently located on Apache, just east of Rural with big parking lot.  Inside the restaurant is simple yet very clean.  Our server was a lovely Chinese young girl speaking in perfect Beijing Mandarin with great manner.    This place must be popular among ASU students, but it is also family friendly.  I will come back more often to enjoy home-cooking!"}
{"text":"I would have given at least four stars, but the service was absolute shit.   So this is a Chinese establishment, as you know, and my friend and I are of Vietnamese (Southeast Asian) descent. We came into a Chinese restaurant and got our food after Chinese people who came in after us. If you don't know anything about Asian culture, look up how much East Asians look down on Southeast Asians.   We were waiting there for at least half an hour before we got our food, so we just decided to bring it home. The food was good, and the service is good for anyone who is not Southeast Asian.   Fuck this place. Only go here if you are of a respected ethnicity. Sorry if you are the wrong race like my roommate and I are.  But maybe if you are lucky, you will get your food out in a timely manner."}
{"text":"Perfect food. Perfect service. Perfect environment. His place had that Chinese restaurant feel to it, and not the Panda Express one, but the local ones with the whole family working Friday nights.  So, we ordered the scallion pancakes, dumplings and shrimp fried rice.   The scallion pancakes were just salty enough to be bland, which was good especially with soy sauce. The dumplings were nice and wet inside with a good proportion of meat and vegetables inside. The fried rice was really really good. Not super oily like some other places and not packed full of toppings... it is fried rice after all.   The service was very good. They are busy, but they speak English well and provide good and efficient service."}
{"text":"I ordered the veggie dumplings to-go over the phone. Even after 45 mins the food was not ordered. This is the second time my food was delayed while picking up my order. If you are hungry, don't go here, because you'll be more hungry with the massive delay they always have.  Very irresponsible staff. Won't come back ever again."}
{"text":"Chou's kitchen has the best Chinese food I have had ever. I ordered five different dishes and each one was superb with distinct flavors and large quantities.   The service is fast and friendly. The place is welcoming and open.   I highly recommend coming here to try the place out"}
{"text":"We love this place!  Such authentic, homey cooking.  The mustard greens soup especially reminds me of my mom's cooking.  The dumplings are yummy, especially the pot stickers and pork dumplings.  I also love the hot and sour soup.  Don't expect too much in terms of the decor (the booths do feel like they're falling apart), but you don't go here to look around.  You go here to eat!  And for such reasonable prices and wholesome food, I think it's easy to overlook any flaws."}
{"text":"I don't know what the rave is about. We had pork potstickers, Mongolian beef and Kung pao. My wife and I would go out of our way for this place but there also is not much else around."}
{"text":"This place always leaves me satisfied. It has excellent food and quick service. I've tried many different items from the menu and have never found a dish I haven't loved."}
{"text":"Come for the food, but don't expect good service.   The food is very authentic Chinese and done well. It's not overly greasy and the meats are cooked just right. I'm sad that the lamb skewers were taken off the menu, because they were my favorite item. The soup dumplings (they call it juicy steamed pork dumplings on their menu) are great, but I think it depends on who is on staff to make them that day. The first time I went, I noticed it was an older, Chinese lady that were sitting there making them and they were much better quality than the young girl that was making them on my second visit. While the meat still tasted delicious, the skin were bursts on all but one of the dumplings made by the younger girl, therefore all the soup had leaked out.   Our waitress the first time there was decent, not exceptional but decent. The waitress we had on our second trip was incompetent and did not seem like she wanted to be there. She walked to our table and handed us water, or a drink or some other things multiple times, and immediately walked away before we could ask to order. We were ready to order for about 10-15 mins and could not get her attention to do so. I even took both our menus and set them at the edge of the table so it didn't look like we were still browsing, but she still didn't notice and kept walking by us. I finally got upset and had to be a bit rude to get her attention to order."}
{"text":"The food here is authentic and good. They are fast and friendly. Only thing that was a bit frustrating is that some of the cold dishes we ordered are way too salty. Both times we came it was the same problem.  The lamb dishes were really good."}
{"text":"Stopped here for late dinner and I am not surprised about the food here since I see their other restaurant in Chandler & it has high review. This location is new to Tempe. We had Xiao long Bao & Kung pao shrimp. Both taste good. XLB taste fresh. Will come back !!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch again and tried some new dishes, still amazing! Definitely recommend the cold spicy noodle and Yangzhou fried rice. The food is flavorful and authentic, you know its legit when they got chili oil and black vinegar on the table ;-)"}
{"text":"Warning! The Chou's Kitchen in Tempe is NOT better than the original one in Chandler/Mesa.   I am mostly rating this new location to compare it to the other original location. First off, it's definitely an improvement on the size of the original. Very spacious, and clean looking. But that's mostly it.   The prices are a little higher, and you don't get the amenities that the original gave you. Like for instance, at the original, you can ask for free corn soup. It's nothing special, but it's free you know!!!! So I was kinda bummed on that. Also the prices for the soup dumplings are a little more expensive, and the quality is slightly less! Like The dumplings can deflate, or not have enough juice in them, and sometimes can be dried up.   I've also had normal stuff like the Kung pao chicken, the deep fried chive buns, and the normal pork buns and they're good.......but NOT as good as the Chou's in Alma School and Ray location."}
{"text":"The original and the BEST place for soup dumplings at Arizona. It's local and it's super authentic! You literally see the ladies roll out dumplings right in front of you which is super cool to know it's made fresh every day!   My family and I have gotten the soup dumplings of course, which is what they're known for! At super flavorful, super hot and steamy, and one of the best things you can eat on a cold day to warm you up! Shoot I'll even eat it on a hot summers day, they're that good! Probably 2-3 orders for 2 people if that's all you're ordering will suffice for a meal.   There's also so much more on the menu too! We've gotten the cold dish that has pig ear and ham and egg and stuff, super good but super weird if you're not used to eating that Asian stuff!!! The fried pork buns are awesome too! The fried chive buns are amazing! The kung pao chicken is sooo flavorful and crispy! Oh also don't forget to ask for the free corn soup! It's bland but just add soy sauce, it'll make it good. Lol   The only negative things, which I won't rate them on is it's a little small. Only sits around 40 people max. But it's mostly locals that come here! Also they're randomly closed on Wednesday's. Kinda weird and funny."}
{"text":"I was blown away at the quality and authenticity of the food.   I didn't find any American favorites like General Tso's Chicken (which was fine) but I did find a lot of authentic Hong Kong stye dishes which did not disappoint.  I had several dumplings which exploded with warm tasty soup in my mouth as well as a few vegetable dishes.  I loved the service - the daughter of the family was our server and she filled us in on a lot of details on the food as well as her culture.  We felt at home and walked out wanting to plan a trip to China. I highly recommend anyone looking for incredible food to try Chous."}
{"text":"This is our first visit to Phoenix and the food is superb! The pan fried dumplings (potstickers) and the seafood soup were so delicious! We also orders a few other dishes and every dish is delicious! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The chicken stir fry is REALLY good. Feel like the speed could be better, but the quality of the food is high."}
{"text":"I had to see what all the hype is about this place. When you walk in a Chinese restaurant and see only a few Asians, it does mean something.....Just wondering what the Travel & Leisure were thinking when they were voted \"Best Chinese Restaurant in the US\" (Say what??.....)  - As soon as we walked in we were seated immediately.  (+5 points) - No welcome, no smile (-1 point) - After our order was taken, a flour soup was brought to us (+5 points) - A few minutes later, still waited for our drinks which was just water (-2 points) - Our order came in a timely manner (+5 points) - Still waited for our water (-3 points) - The pork & shrimp dumpling had a LOT of green onions (-2 points) - Had to ask for utensils. Don't assume because I'm Asian, that I know how to use chopsticks. I saw that  non Asian customers were given a forks & spoons. (-2 points)  - The food was a little above average. I have had better. (+3 points) - Price was ok.  (+2 points) - My water never came. I could have asked, but I wanted to see how attentive the service was. (-8 points)  Total tally  - +2 points.   The Best ...Really?"}
{"text":"Amazing Chinese food in AZ that's not common ! To order: juicy pork buns, pot stickers, and the beef and pork pie!"}
{"text":"Service is NOT good and one tall waitress is really RUDE. Food is fine but the place is not clean. Table is dirty for the past 2 times we have been there. Hopefully they will change the rude waitress and make the table and chopsticks clean."}
{"text":"Authentic Shanghai style food (minus the cold dishes). This tiny restaurant in a strip mall is frequently crowded with Chinese students which is always a good sign right? It helps if you have someone who can read chinese dining with you as the better dishes are written in chinese (always right?).  Don't expect anything on a Panda Express menu to be awesome here, the stars of the menu are dumplings and buns. You have to eat these items in house too, because they won't be as crispy and hot when you get them to go. This is the best place for soup filled dumplings XLB."}
{"text":"Since I moved to Phoenix I have been in search of a place for xiao long bao. Decided to try this while I was in the neighborhood. I did take out. It was easy to order and was ready in 15min or so which gave me enough time to go grab boba milk tea.  Overall the food was ok. The xiao long bao tasted good but I thought the dumpling dough was too thick and there was not as much soup. I also got the beef pies which were pretty good.  The scallions pancakes were a disappointment. They were dry and didn't have much scallions.   And the search continues! Not a bad start tho."}
{"text":"Decent Chinese food, for Phoenix.  The hot and sour soup was actually very good, but didn't have a lot of extras.  The pork fried noodles were flavorful.  The spicy fish fillet in spicy oil was very underwhelming.  I asked for it to be very spicy and I didn't even think about breaking a sweat.  The broth was also rather bland.   My three year old daughter loved the noodles, hence the 3 stars."}
{"text":"What can I say about Chou's that hasn't been said already? The only good authentic Chinese food in the Chandler area. I come from the San Gabriel Valley where good Chinese food is on every street corner. Chou's is still one of the better places I've tried.  Get the pork pies (beef is a little less juicy but still good), beef noodle soup, dumplings (pro tip: you can get frozen ones for home. Fill a medium pot halfway with cold water, put in frozen dumplings, bring to a boil, put a large mug of cold water in, wait for it to boil again and they are done), lamb skewers, and water boiled beef/fish (extremely spicy).  If you're tired of eating Kung pao chicken and beef and broccoli all the time, stop by here. You'll be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Lived in Dongbei for a few years so have had this type Chinese food before.  My first visit the flavors just brought back happy memories.  For the most part the staff is very friendly with occasional exceptions.  Everyone I have introduced to this place go back on their own later.  The best Hot and Sour soup in town.  The fried rice is nicely done not overly saturated with soy.  Pork pies are my favorite of the dumplings.  The fish filet in spicy oil is awesome, also available in beef or pork.  Don't let the name fool you is is not greasy, the majority of the broth is water not oil. and it is minimally spicy unless you ask them to kick it up.  Green onion pancakes are tasty.  I've tried a lot of things and the only one I wouldn't order again is the chicken skewers, too much cumin for my tastes with the chicken flavor but the same cumin on the lamb skewers was fine."}
{"text":"Heard a few things about this place the Juicy Dumplings made them known. So went in and order various plates of items you dont normally see at other Chinese restaurants.. We had the juicy dumplings very good but order tight away as there made to order I was told and tool awhile..the pork neck bones , they jave the clay pot we ordered a mix of pork ribs potatoes and green bean with eggplant very good but a little pricey if bought but peoplewithme loved it.. Small place but was busy and they took good care of us . The stir fry noodles also very good a thicker Cantonese style I think but all in all everything was good or better we will be back for more.."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place more.   They've got their wrapping recipe down. The pastry shell of the pork onion pie (comes in a serving of 3) was thin, crispy, and the right amount of fluffiness too. The only thing I can complain about is their filling. it wasn't flavored enough nor did it have enough green onions or other aromatics they could've really made this an amazing dish.  Steamed soup dumplings were weirdly served on a bed of lettuce (instead of Napa cabbage)  Price: ~$15 for the 3 pork pies and a serving of 8 steamed soup dumplings (???) a.k.a. xiao long bao.  The service was good, and it was fun being able to watch the workers wrap dumplings and buns right in front of you (behind a little glass case.  We got hot tea (free) with the meal and it went together perfectly."}
{"text":"Never ever will I ever come back here during dinner time... my friend and I came at 6:15 and we still waiting our main dish to come out!(it was about 7:40 by the time our stir fried noodles came out) The food is good but the service here not good at all!! They tried to blame what we ordered took the longest to cook!"}
{"text":"I really like this place! Super affordable, quick service, and great food! I ordered a green onion pancake, pork dumplings, and eggplant w/ pork. They were all really good and I had lots of leftovers to take home. I can't wait to return here and try other things on their menu!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for some Northern Chinese food for some fantastic little dragon dumplings and amazing beef pie and etc. Came with family and not too busy so sat immediately. Started with the beef pie which is a must...the green onion pancake was so crispy...and the little dragon dumplings were the best in the area that we have had so far!! The winter melon pork rib soup was very ching and the pork ear was really tasty. The beef tripe was so so. This is their second location and does not have all the choices as their Chandler (and smaller) location but still pretty good for what they have. They also their spicy beef soup which was pretty good as well..."}
{"text":"Stopped by at the best Taiwanese restaurant in the valley hands down!! Everything is good here...started with one of the best pig ear appetizer anywhere...followed by beef pie (number 100 on menu), and then little dragon dumplings!! Their Taiwanese beef noodle is pretty good as well!! All perfectly made!!"}
{"text":"This is one of the most interesting and tasty Chinese food experiences in the valley.  The cuisine originates for a different region of China where there is less rice, so the menu is chock full of noodles, soups and dumplings.  If you're tired of the standard Americanized Chinese over white-rice fare, this is the place for you.  The food is delicious, fresh and very unique.  I would recommend all of the meat pies and dumplings on the menu.  I also enjoy the meatball and cabbage dish."}
{"text":"Super northern-Chinese food!  If you're a fan of spicy and heartier Chinese food, this place has you covered.  It really is excellent and I'd easily give it five stars if the service was a bit quicker, there were more drink options than soda, and there were a dessert or two to select from.  Hot and Sour Soup is some of the best in the Valley, and the folks here do authentic bun and dumpling options under the Handmade Appetizers section of the menu.  The spicy dishes are actually spicy, which rocks.  And the noodle and duck dishes we had were pretty good.  Was cool to see Chinese families eating, hanging out, and conversing with the restaraunt staff.  Reminded me of the tone and feel of places in Taiwan when growing up.  Staff is also nice..."}
{"text":"Food is okay, it is very pricy for average Chinese food. And they have very poor service! The waitress was very rude. 1. She was rude when she was taking our order, when we asked her a question about the menu, she gave us an attitude. 2. When our food is ready, she just dropped the food with a dirty look, she did not say anything and walked away. 3. When we were finishing our food, she did not ask anything but started to clearing our plates and dishes. Overall she was very cold and rude."}
{"text":"I came here last night for dinner.  Order summary: A05 Spicy Beef, Tripe, and Tendon E07 Toothpick Lamb  K12 Shandong Da-Lu Noodle Soup  P13 Steam Juicy Pork Dumplings(10)   The Spicy Beef, Tripe, and Tendon is a cold dish. The initial bite was good; however, the after taste was pure salt and made you crave water. I would stay away from this dish, it made me want to consider taking it back to the kitchen. Also, there was no spice whatsoever to the dish.  The Toothpick Lamb was tender and had the right amount of fat. There was also a slight salty after taste to the meat. Lamb meat is not supposed to be salty, it's supposed to taste clean.  Both the Shandong Da-Lu Noodle Soup and Steam Juicy Pork Dumplings are worth getting at this location. The noodles/dumplings are made from scratch, you can taste it from the texture. both dishes are tender and filling. They remind me more of home-style cooking than restaurant style.  When coming here, you have to know what dishes to order for the best experience, otherwise you may get a dish over saturated in salt."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant, I don't remember how many times I have came here and I always enjoyed their food and service.  I've been to so many Chinese Sichuan (Sczchuan) and Cantonese restaurants in Phoenix area, Chou's is the only one which actually makes authentic Chinese flavors (northern style Chinese food). In the past I took many of my coworkers came here,  they all became regulars. My favorite dishes are spicy beef, tripe, and tendons; lamb skewer; beef/pork pies; beef/pork fried buns, green bean with pork; and fish filet in hot chili oil. Just great!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place for the past 3 years. It is great and the owners and their staff treat me and my family and friends with the best service and are always so friendly. The food is consistent. I always get the soup dumplings, orange chicken, the spicy eggplant and the pork and mustard green soup. So yummy!"}
{"text":"Wow! Really affordable and amazing food. Great service. I was really really impressed. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"food is just average. ordered the beef pie and after eating halfway, realize the beef inside is still raw.....this used to be a good restaurant but the quality is no longer there"}
{"text":"Got seated then completely ignored, after 4 more tables got seated,got menus, got drinks ordered there food I gave up waiting, although it was an enjoyable time being invisible I don't think I will go back"}
{"text":"Love the handmade appetizers. I've liked what I've tried so far from this list. My fav is the #105 pan-fried chive egg pockets. I also like #56 pickle cabbage with sliced pork."}
{"text":"So much richer flavor than many Chinese restaurants. Nothing is masked by soy - just rich flavors of the food and spices. Green beans are a must. I also loved the schezwan beef."}
{"text":"Love everything about this northern Chinese fare.   Looks like a hole in the wall but don't be fooled - hand stretch noodles, fresh dumplings and pastry/dough dishes, and amazing non traditional dishes you'll want to come back to try the entire menu"}
{"text":"Almost a weekly visit for me, this place is amazing.  I have yet to explore the menu as I am fixated on a few items and always have been.    Spicy Cold Cucumber Noodles and the famous Soup Dumplings (Xiaolongbao)  I have made both of these at home, and while I am pretty close on the noodles, the soup dumplings, aside from being a day long affair to make, are still a mystery to me.  These guys have it down pat!    See you next week!"}
{"text":"Bad experience I ever had. I think the only normal food is beverage. As a Chinese from northeastern, I can't give even one star for this restaurant."}
{"text":"Really good! The restaurant is in a strip mall and has an unassuming storefront, but is clean and comfortable. We were after selections that weren't spicy, so picked Beef with Broccoli, Orange Chicken, Stir fried Mixed Vegetables and Pork Potstickers. Everything was delicious, although we wouldn't order the potstickers again.  The restaurant is not licensed and the \"herbal tea\" is actually iced tea in a can - good, but just not what was expected! It was busy and there were lots of telephone take out orders while we were there, which is something we'd consider in the future too."}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp I found  that Chou's had a closer location for me. We always missed the food at their Alma school location but it was always too out of the way for us. They did a good job with the renovations with lots of clean booths & tables everything was very new. This restaurant is right behind a filiberto's drive thru on Apache and close to ASU.   We ordered the #86 spicy garlic eggplant, #109 beef pies and #120 xiao long bao. The eggplant came out first with white rice. It was really yummy I wish they added some fried tofu. You'll enjoy this if you like sweet and spicy.  The #109 & 120 beef pies and Xiao long bao  are a must trys! Beef pies are like large dim sum. Don't  underestimate them when you bit into they are juicy and full of flavor.  #120 soup dumplings XLB. The easisest way to eat it is to dunk them in the ginger vinegar sauce put them on your soup spoon and SLURP it up! Slurping is encouraged (it just means it's darn delicious)   We washed down our meals with green tea. Next time we will try the soy milk that they prepared fresh in a large pot and just eat all XLB because they are that good!"}
{"text":"The menu they show here on yelp does not match their true menu prices are at least three dollars more than what is shown on the menu that they have on here their online menu and the menu pictures do not match what they have listed on their yelp!"}
{"text":"I think this is more an issue with me than the place, so take that into account. Went in because it has great reviews and is different than a lot of other Chinese restaurants. We ordered a handful of dishes to try different things and none of it really stood out for me. That said, this place was packed and the traffic of people never slowed down so I'm assuming it's just not my cup of tea. Check it out for yourself if you want some Chinese food but not the normal Americanized fried everything and served drowning in sauce kind of food."}
{"text":"Excellent won ton soup and steamed pork dumplings.  Also tried pork, shrimp & chive dumplings which were good but not great.  Prices were really good for the quality and service was very friendly.  You can smell this is authentic as soon as you walk in. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing just like the original location in Chandler.  My dad loves this place and wanted to eat Chous as soon as he got off the plane from SFO. Chandler is closed on Wed so we drove here and when we arrived they had just closed for the afternoon at 3!! Oh no! But the staff was so nice they let us stay and order because I told them how much my dad loved their food.  We happened to see the owner there who remembered my dad. Food was consistent as Chandler and the decor and ambiance was lovely! It's like the chandler loc with a face lift."}
{"text":"I've never had better tasting dumplings. This place is super authentic. You come here for the food only period. It's a small old fashion place. My dad who traveled all over China says this place tasted way better than restaurants in LA and SF and was shocked to find a gem in Arizona.  I would recommend the beef pan fried buns, pork dumplings and soy milk (homemade)."}
{"text":"Great food and very nice people.  We were warmly greeted upon arrival, served quickly, and the food was delivered in series to ensure we could enjoy each course without food getting cold.  we will return."}
{"text":"This place is too inconsistent. Last time I got the spicy szechuan chicken, the chicken and the pepper were charred. Completely inedible. And I got it to go, which means I drove 8 miles to get it and only saw the condition of the meal later on. I usually tip them when I get to go meal and they don't even bother looking to at it to see in what condition it is. Terribly disappointed."}
{"text":"Went back again today & everything was spot on.  Of the specialties, had the beef buns, the pot stickers & the beef pies. Added the cold, spicy noodles with cucumber & the cumin lamb.  Everything was fantastic.   The dumplings & pies were hot and the super tasty. I love what they do with the fillings. Great flavors. But they are really amazing with the dough parts. The bun of the beef bun itself was fantastic. Chewy, crispy, perfect. The dumpling wrapper of the pot stickers was also wonderful. I know they do XLB at times & I need to try that. I've heard it's gotten better from when they first started. If it's not fantastic yet, I have hope that they'll get there.  Everything just seemed so much more dialed in than my last visit. That was a good while ago.  I definitely won't be waiting as long until I return!"}
{"text":"Dropping the review down here due to lack of service and lack of flavors.  Sat our group of white folks down and we were the only white people in there. Took about 10 mins before anyone that worked there even acknowledged us. The entire restaurant was chinese people.  The young guy who is the waiter came over and just slapped some menus down and then brought us glasses of luke warm water.  We tried the Kung Pao and the Cumin Beef this time around. Neither was anything to write home about at all. Both needed a lot of soy sauce and sriracha for any flavoring.  We will skip this place and go to the Magic Noodle House from now."}
{"text":"Some of the best Chinese food I've had outside of LA or SF Chinatowns.  We tried a nice mix of dishes and were not disappointed.  Need to come back to try some more. Don't skip the pot stickers"}
{"text":"OK, from the Yelp Reviews, I would've tried this place, But my wife has been here a couple times and we needed something close to Discount Tire. So, we tried.   She had Beef Stew Noodle soup. This was actually decent and good flavor, and I would have done almost 4 stars for this.. But that's not how i roll.   New Chinese places, there are a few plates i order to test. #1 Mongolian Beef. Noticed the little Chili next to the Menu list and like that, though I have had non spicy Mongolian beef a lot also, but was looking for a little heat... That said..  Beef. size was ok, a little on the smaller side, but decent flavor. What killed it was way over cooked. Onions, were saute'd pretty good, and those sizes were spot on.. No mushrooms, oh wait this isn't Pei Wei (lol), something was missing though... Chili... This had 0 heat, no flavor of chili, nor anything readable on any heat index. I hope they didn't assume, I am white and probably don't like spicy foods...   No Heat and overcooked meat.  I may give this place another shot and get something a little more on the made from scratch there next time.. 2.5 Stars would be my rank here, but Service Was very good.(I must be getting soft) ** Sometimes small shops striving to cover their expenses is tough and reviews can impact business.."}
{"text":"My parents are regulars here. The restaurant has a family owned feel. The decor is simple, nothing special per se. The waitress is super friendly and welcoming, she actually remembers my family and enjoys chatting with us. Their service is quick and efficient, food is pretty authentic. I wasn't too impressed with the beef patties/pies (not sure what it's called in English lol) ???? because it was kind of sour, which is strange to me. The chives pattie was on point though (????) !!! Loved the soup dumplings too, better than most places I've been too. The jalapeño potatoes were yummy, the eggplant was average (kind of oily). I also loved the lamb skewers, they were perfectly seasoned and tender! Overall a great experience and such a relief that Arizona has legit Chinese food :)"}
{"text":"For lunch we had the green onion pancake, pork/shrimp/chive dumplings, beef pies and soup dumplings. It was pretty packed for lunch and tons of Asian people so good sign. Started off a little rocky as the waitress was snippy. It's her job to remember the order #'s, not mine. A bad attitude is forgivable if the food is exceptional and that did not happen in this case.  Based on the recommendations I felt that the beef pies and green onion pancake were just so- so. I did like the hot chili sauce but it was just carb-overload and not a ton of flavor for those 2 dishes. If I had to pick favorites it would have to be the dumplings. They were piping hot so I suggest you wait a bit. Giving it an average score between the service but the price was right as lunch for 2 was $10."}
{"text":"The service at Chou's Kitchen was great! Our server helped us out with choosing some foods we were curious to try, like the pork pies. The space was clean but small. Definitely a casual attire eatery. You can sit and eat there or order take out. Decently priced, for either a small party or large party. We spent a little under $40 for 4 plates. We ordered string beans with minced pork, orange chicken, fried rice with pork & shrimp, and the pork pies. All the food was savory, but I did think the pork in the rice was a bit dry (over cooked) and the same with the orange chicken. My boyfriend who came with me rated the restaurant 5 stars, he loved the food. Overall, I had a good experience here thanks to our lovely server who had great service."}
{"text":"A fantastic Chinese restaurant. All of their appetizers are delicious, especially the dumplings and meat pies. The eggplant with garlic sauce is rich and complex with or without pork. Definitely try the fried rice, especially the mushroom one. Actually, get anything that says mushroom or fungus. All the meat dishes I've tried are fantastic and all nonrice or noodle dishes come with rice which great. Just make sure to call ahead so you don't come during the break they take mid afternoon for lunch."}
{"text":"I have been finding Chinese restaurant since I moved to Tempe. Yesterday (Oct 2, 2016), my friend brought us to Chou's Kitchen. It was amazing and really cure my home-sick. Most of the food, service, and environment are good and relaxing. Also, the price is reasonable. Thus, I would like to give them 4/5.  [Food] I and four of my friends order 6 dishes in total: Spicy Beef Tripe, Stir-fry eggplant & minced pork with garlic sauce, Toothpick lamb, Szechuan Spicy Chicken, Kung Bao Chicken, Stir-fry Chinese wood ear mushroom with shanyao. And the rice are unlimited supply. They are all in a big portion which can serve 5-6 people.  * Spicy Beef Tripe: It's a cold dish. Instead of spicy, it's taste more\" numb\".  * Stir-fry eggplant & minced pork with garlic sauce: I had really high expectation on this dish, however, I think it is the one that tastes furthest from the genuine flavor. I might not order it next time. * Toothpick lamb: They strung small pieces of lamb on the toothpick and flavored it with cumin. It was good but not great because the dish was cold when it's served. * Szechuan Spicy Chicken: This dish is made with huge amounts of hot pepper, but it's not super spicy.   * Kung Bao Chicken: This dish is more sweet than spicy.  * Stir-fry Chinese wood ear mushroom with Shanyao: I wasn't expect much about the dish at first cause I'm not fan of either Chinese wood ear or Shanyao. However, the taste was amazing. It has the smell coming from stir-frying (the smell which fried rice usually have). I also order Plums juice. It's not too sour nor sweet. It drinks more like tea. I don't really like how it taste. All the dishes go well with rice. To sum up, I would recommend Spicy Beef Tripe and Stir-fry Chinese wood ear mushroom with shanyao as the must-try dishes.   [Service] The servers were kind. They asked us if we need some drinks first and gave us plenty of time discussing before taking our order. All the dishes came approximately at the same time. The waiting time was a little bit long, but it's still endurable. They came and asked we need more water or rice just when we need, and that was great. The only complaint I had was that sometimes the server took the place so fast that made us felt a little stressful.  [Environment] The restaurant is located next to New School for the Arts & Academics on Apache Boulevard. There're spaces to park cars and bikes. The restaurant is bright, clean and in a Chinese style. They provide traditional round table which many people can seat together.  This is my first time dining at Chou's Kitchen, and, surely, I'll visit it next time. I'm glad to find a Chinese restaurant that provide genuine traditional foods. I would like to try some Handmade Appetizers and Clay Pots next time!  If you're still hesitate whether to try or not, it's definitely the right place explore Chinese cuisine."}
{"text":"We had to fight our way for a booth. We waited for over 20 minutes to place the order and for 30 minutes for the food to arrive, decor is minimal at best, I did not dare to try the restrooms (even though I wanted to), but, would I go back? HELL, yeah!   The spicy fish stir fry is the best I have ever put into my mouth. Chicken on skewers had an overdose of cumin, but, the freshness made up for that. I will try the lamb the next time. The soups looked hearty - on my wishlist for the next time I manage to convince my hubby to step in and not look longlingly across the street at China King.  A hidden gem!"}
{"text":"I heard about this place and wanted to try it for a while. I have to say that the food we ordered is  just ok, not that special. One order dumpling came in 8 pieces and two of them broke so the taste was plain. Their special green bean pork bum is so dry and the skin is very thick. I have to swallow it with the soup. The bill is $40. For two people, it feels a  little too much. Overall?there are not things you feel like to go back for for the price they charge."}
{"text":"Chou's was real authentic Chinese.  My friend Lee and I tried 6 or more dishes, which was probably enough food for four, but we were on a mission to see what this place was all about.  They actually moved us from a two-top to a four-top because we had so much food coming.    The dumplings with soup in them were great.  The beef patty wrapped in dumpling shell was very good too.  We also had the eggplant with garlic sauce (spot on) and the Cumin Lamb, which was really different for a Chinese place, but also crazy good.    The only dish that wasn't amazing was the Kung Pao Chicken."}
{"text":"First let me say that I've spent quite a bit of time in China and used to speak fluent Mandarin. I've had both really good and really terrible Chinese food; I've had both very traditional and extremely innovative Chinese cuisine--all in China.  I went to the Tempe location and ordered Mongolian beef and asked them to add a few mixed vegetables--zucchini, broccoli, pea pods, whatever--because I like vegetables and they're good for you. \"I'm happy to pay extra,\" I said. I do this at Chinese restaurants all the time and it's very rarely a problem--no one bats an eye.  But at this place, some woman bustles out of the kitchen and starts lecturing me on how customers cannot expect the kitchen to change their recipe. \"I'm not asking you to change your recipe,\" I said. \"Leave the sauce exactly as it is. I'm just asking you to toss a few extra vegetables into the wok and heat them through before you put everything on a plate.\"  \"But that's not traditional!\" she said.  \"So what?\" I said. \"Mongolian beef has peppers in it, and they're indigenous to the Americas, not Asia. So someone in China deviated from tradition at some point for this dish to even exist.\"  \"It will ruin the taste!\" she insisted.  \"You're telling me that it will ruin the taste of the whole dish if you toss a few vegetables into the wok for a couple of minutes? It's not like broccoli disintegrates that easily.\"  \"If you want Chinese food that isn't authentic, you should go somewhere else,\" she said. \"We serve authentic Chinese food here.\"  \"Next time, I certainly will,\" I said. \"But can you just throw some damn vegetables in there this time anyway, like I asked?\"  So I got the vegetables I wanted. And the dish was tasty. But next time, I will take the cook's advice and go somewhere else. Because I don't need to be bullied into eating food prepared any way but the way I want it. Food constantly evolves and it's simply not too much to ask of a restaurant that they make easy alterations to suit a customer's preferences, especially when the customer is willing to pay."}
{"text":"What started as \"dinner\" quickly became an evening of my wildest pig fantasies.  We started at the top: pig ears, sliced thin and served in a heap of fresh herbs. Pungent, savory, addictive.  We moved down to the neck, stewed and plated solo, white rice on the side. Fragrant, tender, and too good not to use your hands a little (a lot.) Once you go neck, you never go back.   Even further down... Pork ribs in a clay pot. Served alongside salty, saucy eggplant and potatoes, piping hot. Damned if we waited for it to cool to a reasonable temperature.   Lastly, mouth-first into unknown pig part territory.  Pork and Napa cabbage, entwined beneath the doughy folds of soup dumplings.  If you are what you eat... Let's just say I'm f*cking awesome."}
{"text":"We were told that if we wanted good Chinese that we were going to have to travel all the way to Glendale. So imagine my delight when I found out that all I had to do was travel right down the street from my husband's work in Tempe to find excellent family run Chinese food. I'm not talking about your typical overly breaded meat covered in red syrupy sweet and sour sauces, but delicately tenderize pieces of crispy pork covered in a ginger sweet-and-sour sauce of a normal color. I also highly recommend of their Mongolian beef, juicy pork dumplings, garlic chicken and vegetables, and many of the vegetarian offerings that they have. My boys love this place so much that they ask for any chance they get."}
{"text":"Found a very good chinese restaraunt in Chandler of all places. My order consisted of beef pies, mongolian beef, tofu, & steamed dumplings. All were good......favorite would be the meat pies. The place itself is small so get here early for dinner as it gets packed in the weekend."}
{"text":"I'm amazed to find a place like this in AZ!! I was ranting and raving about it for days because it really surprised me how good it could be.   When I went there, I got so excited I ordered AALLL of my favorites. Got the green onion pancake (delish), egg and chive dumplings (yummy!), potstickers (pretty good), freshly made dumplings (so good).   The staff there was really friendly and sweet. Real Chinese people making the dumplings right in the front so you know it's fresh! it's not the cleanest place and the menu might be confusing if you haven't had this type of food before but this would be a good place to try something new! :D"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food ever! I have never had North-Eastern Chinese food and am a convert. Don't expect your everyday Americanized Chinese food - expect to try something new and enjoy then experience. Don't skip the beef buns - and with the amazing prices, I recommend trying a bunch of different items. Everything is made in house - don't miss the handmade noodles.   There is a bit of a language barrier but the owners are extremely nice and super patient. They checked on us frequently and treated us as if they were delighted that we came - and it was genuine. Great food and experience."}
{"text":"Its a small place that is locally owned. It has a very authentic tasting food, so it might not suit all tongues. But it is sure tastes damn good for me. There were some misses for me because of the huge range in the menu but I found my favorites. So try till you find something you like and you will love it. My recommendation: dumplings, schezuan chicken, kung pao, cumin calamari, mapo tofu and hot tea."}
{"text":"Love this place. Their Szehuan Spicy Chicken is the bomb. I love spicy food and it comes with a pile of crispy fried chili pepper on top of well seasoned chicken. Their sweet and sour chicken tastes great too. They also have You Tiao (Chinese fried dough sticks) on weekends.  Make sure to try their hot soy milk too! Unsweetened and yummy."}
{"text":"Best thing is the spicy beef, tendon cold dish!!! LOVE the sensation, taste and texture. I always have so much fun eating it. It's such a social dish where you should share as a group - pick, eat and chat.   Beef Stew Noodle Soup is tasty as well and great for cold weather days. Noodles are nice and chewy and the broth is not overseasoned where you feel like you're drinking condiment soup.   Though they have a large homemade dumpling/ bun selection, they're only okay to me. Haven't tried one yet that blows my mind."}
{"text":"My wife and I went there for a late lunch.  It was a busy Sunday afternoon.  We were seated at the last table which was a tight fit and it backed up to their ice freezer (which they filled up while we were eating). I ordered the pork and mushrooms and my wife had the noodles and vegetables.  She had specifically asked for a plate with lots of vegetables but was sorely disappointed.  The noodles were salty and the vegetables were non-existent.  My pork dish was good.  I like the menu choices and will give it another try because I like authentic Chinese food.  This trip was so-so."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised to find this authentic Chinese place in Arizona. This is NOT American Chinese by all means. There is no general chicken, orange chicken or any of the American Asian dishes here, at least not in the menu I was provided. Anything in the Chinese menu that we tried was very good.  - Stir-fried intestines - Stir-fried pig stomach - stewed ribs - cabbage - steamed juicy buns - scallion pancake  - dried poke or beef pancakes - chicken-mushroom pot  The owner is a Chinese chef that is what I heard  And I give myself credibility because I live in the San Francisco Bay Area and is pampered with good Chinese food daily"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese place in town. A huge menu with a variety of 'authentic' style dishes. Not your typical Chinese food!"}
{"text":"This was our second time at this establishment. They must've changed chefs, the dumplings were a bit better than last time. We also ordered the sweet and sour fish. The fish would have been sooo much better if they fried it longer. The service was good but the food quality is not consistent. This is one of those places where you can find a few awesome dishes on the menu but the rest could be blah."}
{"text":"Customer Service = 5* Taste = 5* Portion Size = 5*  I would recommend this place to anybody who loves truly authentic Chinese Food"}
{"text":"Checked out this place for a friend-gathering.  Really liked the beef pie, which surprised me with the soup inside.  The pork, sour cabbage, and frozen tofu soup was wonderful.  As a person who is familiar with Northern China cuisine, I'd say that this place is authentic.  Next time want to check the pork soup bun and noodles."}
{"text":"I'm giving Chou's 4 stars because they came through in my time of need.  In SoCal, they'd probably be a solid 3-star spot, maybe a little less. So take this review however you want...don't @ me!  Hubby and I had been in town the last couple days for spring training.  Before that, we hadn't had very much Asian food.  So by Thursday night, I was itching. I need something...anything.  After much debate (and realization that our options were pretty limited in this area), we came here.  This place is seriously no frills.  Don't come here expecting ambiance.  The clientele reflected the local demographic, students....but most were Asian students, likely desperate for a taste of home.  We arrived at 8pm and were seated promptly.  For food, we ordered way too much (are you surprised?) and decided on a large wonton soup, a large hot and sour soup, xiao long bao, and vermicelli with ground pork dish (\"ants going up a tree\").  The portions were preeettty big.  The soups were ginormous.  Wonton soup: Good Hot & Sour soup: Spicy and sour but could have used a bit more flavor Xiao Long Bao: Decent; skins were sort of mushy and we broke many of them because they stuck to the steamer via the holes in the parchment paper. Vermicelli:  Pretty good but not what I'm used to; they basically used the same ingredients for ma po tofu and cooked vermicelli with it.  Also, the prices were pretty reasonable for the amount of food you get so I can see why a lot of students come here.  Anyway, not a bad place if you're in town and need something."}
{"text":"What..... what..... why? I've been to the other location of Chou's (which I thought was ok) and couldn't resist the temptation of XLB in Tempe.... but no. The husband and I ordered the xiao long bao and a spicy beef dish. I love XLB...they're one of my very favorite foods. This one was a huge disappointment. The flavor was just.... off. So much so.... that we didn't finish them. This never NEVER has happened to me. Maybe there was just something off the day we went, but it was awful. The beef was dry and lacked flavor. It was fairly expensive (more than the Chandler location). I'd go elsewhere in the future."}
{"text":"I have to give this place props for having XLB.... I always appreciate that.... and they were tasty, but I have had better in the valley. I came here with a friend and we shared the XLB, potstickers, scallion pancake, and beef pie. The XLB were the best item, juicy and tasty. The potstickers were good, but they had a weird film underneath that connected the dumplings... if you didn't peel this off, it tasted pretty funky. The scallion pancakes were tasty but a bit limp... not crispy like I've had at other restaurants. The beef pie was really yummy, I would get that again. Prices were reasonable. I wouldn't say no if someone wanted to come here, but I probably wouldn't make a special trip here otherwise."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of their mabo dofu.   I can eat it for days on end.  If you are interested in trying new kinds of Chinese food this is the place to go to!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  I have never been let down here. I usually get a vegetable sir fry, with noodles. And I never get tired of it. My boyfriend however tries something new each time. He's gotten things I thought I'd never try, and I loved them!  But oh my god, their DUMPLINGS. they are amazing. My partner and I can down 9 in 2 minutes. Usually it's a bit of a wait to get them, so if you do want the dumplings order them first before anything else. They're usually the last things we get. But that's not a bad thing, it's an awesome way to end a meal!  It's clean here, we get sat as soon as we walk in. Even though some of the workers don't speak the best English, they're still so sweet and will explain dishes to you. They're very attentive, always offering to refill our water, asking how we like it, and they bus tables promptly.   They have point in the day where they're closed for two hours, I think normally around 3/5 so I would call around then and see if they're taking guests."}
{"text":"Came here after searching Yelp for nearby restaurants while visiting my boyfriend's family in Chandler.  Little did we/they know that this awesome Chinese restaurant exists just feet from their door.  It was a Sunday night and the restaurant was about 60% full on arrival and to the max when we left (so takeout may be recommended).  We devoured several good dishes shared among the table: Pork potstickers Mongolian beef Sweet and sour pork House special fried noodles Eggplant with pork and garlic sauce  The potstickers started us off on the right foot, some of the best I have had and we saw them being made later during the meal in house.  The pork and beef dishes were arguably great standards while the house noodles came with three meats and was huge and delicious and the eggplant was succulent and well flavored.  We surprisingly had no leftovers which is usually a very good sign in a Chinese restaurant.  Walked away with just over a $40 bill which is a remarkably good deal.  Loved dinner here!"}
{"text":"Really good spot! I've had veggie dumplings, pan fried egg/chive pockets, wonton soup and Mongolian beef. Service is nice and as helpful as possible. They do close for an hour for their staff lunch, usually around 3-4. I'm excited to try more menu items, especially the soup dumplings which I am told are the best ever! The most delicious Chinese food I've had in awhile. It's not the typical Americanized (for lack of a better term) versions with everything covered in sauces, no lunch combo plates. Everything is family style, so bring a friend! (although, I go alone and keep the leftovers). The flavors are really clean, everything I've had so far seems to be made in house. I'm impressed. The inside is spacious, filled with mostly tables and a few booths. Decor is simple, there are wooden chopsticks on the table, along with chili oil. Really wonderful, down-to-earth, just plain good restaurant."}
{"text":"Chou's gets 2 stars because the food was good. The service was horrible. Our order was taken soon enough, but then it was 45 minutes before we got anything. At that point our waiter peeked around the corner and saw our still-empty table. He got a shocked look on his face and took off (presumably to the kitchen). It was another 10 minutes at least before our first dish came. Followed a few minutes later by our second dish. About 20 minutes later (we had finished the first 2 dishes), the third dish was delivered. We asked about the appetizer (the steamed dumplings) and the waiter apparently didn't get that we wanted the steamed dumplings, so we left without them. Somebody else came to the table with apologies, but no authority to make any effort to recoup the loss and try to make us happy customers. A manager with any sense would have written off the meal entirely. They offered nothing to mitigate the situation. So here I am on Yelp saying \"good food - crappy service.\""}
{"text":"Tried Chou's for the first time today.  Appreciated the above Yelp reviews bc they were all spot-on and helpful.    Since I went with my little girl only, couldn't do what I wanted to do which was order several dishes to share.  Instead, I just tried some of the recommendations of other Yelpers.  Tried the cucumber and garlic salad #2, and the pork soup dumplings #120, with a side of white rice.    The dumplings were delicious with the dipping sauce.  Perfectly cooked and very filling.  When I saw the size of the cucumber salad, I didn't think I'd be able to eat much, however it was yummy and I ended up scarfing it completely.  The food definitely deserved 5/5 stars.  I agree with other Yelpers that the service was slow, however the servers were very kind and helpful when I had questions.    Will definitely return, and soon.  Next time plan to take another adult with me to share a few other dishes.  Can't emphasize enough how delicious, fresh, and clean my food tasted.     Update 10/29/16 returned for a second try last night, had to get the dumplings again bc they're amazeballz.  Also tried the Mongolian beef and the kung pao chicken.  I liked both and had plenty for leftovers .  Last update, I promise.  11/7/16.  Came and tried the  House Special Noodles and the Garlic Eggplant (#87).  Both were delish and I'm stuffed.  Beef pie was excellent too!"}
{"text":"very interesting:) but thats what i love about Chinese people and the way they run business! i lived in china for a couple years and this place brings me back. awesome service even though the whole family and my server was eating at the same time i was there. you can tell this family has close relationships and they prob eat here 3 times a day when it's not busy. also love how they enjoyed each other's company while laughing and talking with their mouths full! lol. you can tell they love the food they make and they put a lot of love into it.  the place is your normal traditional Chinese decor with lots of red making the place very lucky! each table is equipped with the must have SRIRACHA! you don't need to ask for chopsticks cause every table has a box full of them. these people are smart! everything is great!  i tried the steamed dumplings(pork) 7 dollars for mostly all the items on the menu. it was a good portion, but i could have ate 4 more or so... left kinda still hungry  The Dumplings were amazing, and this place is within walking distance from my house!  i will definitely come back."}
{"text":"No stars!! If you're not Asian, save yourself being ignored for an hour before they take your order. Then expect to wait until every Asian is served first before they even make your food... terrible place and service."}
{"text":"I eat in chandler location often, and I am happy with their food in chandler location. BUT Don't eat at tempe one. Me and my boyfriend eat dinner at tempe location today and it was terrible experience ever. We order beef pancakes as usual but it taste bad and kinda sour. We tell the waiter then the manager comes, an old lady with rude attitude. She argue with us with unpleasant tone, and blaming us for order it. She return the dish but She keep blaming us while she is behind the counter so we can hear her voice during entire dinner. What a SHAME! That kind of service is unbelievable, I have never seen that for my life! CHOOSE SOMEWHERE ELSE TO EAT!"}
{"text":"One of the most authentic Northern Chinese food here in the Valley.  We have been there several times and it is one of the true Authentic place that is so rare in the USA.  It isn't a ritzy place like most places in China but the food is superb just like home of a KMT soldier and what they would make when they considered you their VIP so I can definitely attest to that.  The craftsmanship of their dumplings is superb because it will melts in your mouth unlike many places that have frozen their dumplings for a long time.  They also have Korean dishes as well.  Love the place."}
{"text":"If you are in a hurry, this is not the place to go.  However, great food cannot be made quickly and this is the best Chinese food I have eaten since moving to Arizona.  The dumplings are absolutely delicious.  My daughter and I went on a Friday night at 6:30 and the place was packed.  We waited in front of the door as people came in and out to pick up orders.  There is a big window where you can see the cooks making dumplings.    We ordered pork, chives and shrimp dumplings, which come in a plate of 10.  For our main dish, we ordered stir fried noodles and stir-fried rice.  Both dishes were flavorful and delicious.  My daughter tried the plum juice and did not care for it. I ordered herbal tea, which I thought was going to be warm, but it was a canned tea that tasted like jasmine tea.  The service was very good."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in the East Valley! Having visited China multiple times, this place is on point with their food. Will go back time and time again."}
{"text":"This place is bomb. Big portions, super reasonable prices, every time I come here I order something random because it's a huge menu but everything is always great. Fave chinese restaurant hands down."}
{"text":"Got my Chinese food fixed here and its on my list for every time I come to Phoenix , Need I say more?"}
{"text":"Servers are incredibly rude. Female Chinese server dumped our dumplings on the table (not joking) and walked away. Didn't know why we were treated that way but sure won't event be bringing friends or families back. Also food was average at best."}
{"text":"One of the more authentic Chinese restaurants I've found during my time in Arizona. My only comment would be that it appears if you are not Asian that they make the food considerably less spicy (in my mind too mild). Be sure you ask them to not tone it down."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed eating at their other location so I had to try their new location near ASU. The menu is identical and the food tasted very similar. This is newer location so it's cleaner, has nicer booths, and has more staff working. There were lots of students eating here as well, so be prepared to wait during peak hours.  Their soup dumplings came out nice and hot. It oozes juice as you bite into it. The flavor was spot on and had plenty to share (10 per order).   Their chive and egg pockets were one of my favorites. This would be good as a breakfast entree. The noodle dish, beef pie, and vegetables we ordered were all very tasty.   Looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"Chou's Kitchen has very authentic Chinese food with mostly Chinese customers. They had very extensive menu offerings.   The cold spicy beef, tripe and tendon was delicious. It had the chili oil seasoning which had the 'numbing' qualities. Highly recommend getting this dish to share.  The Chinese vegetables were well seasoned and had plenty garlic taste. They just didn't mix the seasonings very well as I had few bites of pure salt. The rest were very yummy though.  Their dumplings were delicious too. Very juicy and flavorful. It had the perfect homemade taste to it. I want to try their other dumpling dishes next time.  Overall, very happy with all the dishes we ordered. There were several we are looking forward to trying next time."}
{"text":"Best chinese food around Phoenix. I drive all the way from Glendale for their dumplings. DELICIOUS."}
{"text":"\"If, in the midst of a Szechuan pepper-heavy meal, you have the presence of mind to ignore the searing hot pain that fills your mouth, you might notice a more subtle effect of eating the hot peppers: a tingling, numbing sensation that envelops your lips and tongue.\"  ? smithsonianmag.com  We weren't originally going to grab dinner.  We had a gigantic lunch in Prescott earlier that day and was next door getting some mediocre boba.  On the way to the car though, I had mentioned I had wanted to try the Beef Pies at Chou's so here we are!  I've been to their first location and had an okay experience and much similar, I had an okay experience here as well.  I will say that I love how this place has more seating.  Their first location is much too small.  So here at Chou's, we had gotten the Beef Pies, Spicy Fish Fillet, and the Toothpick Lamb.  Beef Pie, $6 for 3:  Delicious, juicy, and full of flavor.  I would come back and order these again.  The outside is like a green onion pancake batter, sans the onions, the the inside absolutely exploded with beefy juices [don't be dirty].  It was hot and flavorful!  Spicy Fish Fillet, $10.98:  That tongue-numbing quote applies.  I don't like how Szechuan style cooking numbs the tongue.  It's not spicy and it just numbs the tongue for no reason at all.  I want to attribute it to the pickled vegetables too but I don't really know that for a fact.  Regardless, I didn't enjoy this this.  The fish was battered lightly and nicely and the pickled peppers on top gave it a sour bite.  They were incredibly light on the dry Szechauan peppers.  The flavor was on the imbalance side, being way more sour than spicy.  Toothpick Lamb, $14.98:  We were going to this one other restaurant, GTB, that makes this dish AMAZING but they were closed for the holiday so we went somewhere else but it was still on my mind.  So when I saw it on the menu, I got it.  It was decent but I think I prefer the other place for this dish.  The lamb was a bit tough and definitely gamey.  Jalapeño slices gave it a nice heat and they were quite heavy-handed on the fennel seeds.  All in all, if I ever crave XLB or a beef pie, I'll stop by!  Service was excellent and the place was clean."}
{"text":"If someone tells you that you are the ginger vinegar to their xiaolongbao, marry them.    Sooo... instead of listening to my fellow Yelpers, I took some blind advice given on Instagram and ended up getting an unsatisfying meal.  We had ordered the Green Onion Pancake [103], The Pork Soup Dumplings/Xiaolongbaos (XLB) [111], the Pickled Vegetable with Pig Intestine Clay Pot [39], and the Sweet & Sour Fish [86].  I had completely forgot to order the Beef Pie, which is apparently juicier/saucier and more flavorful, much to my disappointment.    Anyways, what I really wanted were the XLB and they were decent!  Everything is handmade and the skins on these babies were tender and delicate.  Sadly, it was so delicate that three out of seven of the soup dumplings had been punctured and spilled its soup before we could even pick them up to eat.  The ones with that still had the soup were pretty good though.  My companion's dish, the pickled veggies with intestines in a clay pot, was flavorful and the intestines were thankfully clean.  Ain't nobody got time for particles-filled intestines!  The onion pancake and the sweet & sour fish were lacking luster.  The onion pancake lacked any flavor or seasoning and the fish dish came out soggy.  It was such a bummer!   The service can be pretty slow since it's a really popular joint that's much too small.  There was a line out the door!  Halfway through our meal, we were asked to relocated to a booth so we can give our table up to a single lonely diner which I understand but it was kind of a drag to walk across the restaurant balancing your purse, jacket, and plate.  I never did get a water refill either.    All in all, I'd come back for the XLB and to try their Beef Pies [get your mind outta the gutter!]."}
{"text":"Chinese cuisine is not on top of my list for my daily diet, however I have no regrets nor complaints in trying this restaurant.   My boyfriend and I decided to order a few dishes such as shrimp dumplings, wonton soup, beef with green onions and the pork. Every dish was impeccable and very reasonably priced. Perhaps what I liked the most was the soup, often either too watery or too highly flavored. This one was perfect. I'm glad the waitress warned us with the size of the \"small\" soup, since even their smaller size can feed two.   The waitress was pleasant and attentive. She provided recommendations on dishes. That's the way to go!  I'm new in the area so I wouldn't dare to call it the best Chinese food in town. But I'm definitely impressed and I wouldn't mind coming here more often. ??"}
{"text":"If u like authenticed northern chinese food then this is for u. Trust me I was born and raised in that region of China."}
{"text":"Looking for excellent and authentic northeastern Chinese comfort food (pasta and dumplings) in the greater Phoenix area? Look no further than Chou's Kitchen! They have two locations. The original is in Chandler and the newer location, the subject of this review, is in Tempe, very near the ASU campus.  Perfectly situated on a corner location in a small strip mall, this unassuming family-style restaurant is a big draw for many students and local residents alike. And, when most of the customers are Chinese or Asian, you know you've walked in the right place.  The service was quick and friendly. The servers were attentive and exhibited great teamwork. The humble but very passionate owner really made all of her diners feel at home. She was also very hands-on and was involved in many front of the house operations, including waiting tables.  Other than a few items which are familiar to most American diners, the place also features several Szechuan specials. But, pasta and HAND MADE, yes, I said, HAND MADE, dumplings are the reasons why this place is a must eat in when in Phoenix.  For our dinner, my wife and I ordered Chinese cucumber salad appetizer (best way to describe it), beef fried rice, Xiao Long Bao (soup dumplings, 10 pieces per order) and shrimp, pork and chive dumplings (also 10 per order).  The fresh and crunchy cucumbers (small Chinese cucumbers), tossed in freshly minced garlic, sesame oil, rice vinegar, sugar and salt, was a very refreshing opener for a hot summer evening.  The beef fried rice was excellent. Overly salted and soy sauce drenched brown mystery deal one would usually expect from one too many Chinese carry outs and restaurants trying to appeal to the majority of American taste buds will not be found here. Instead, you will find what the Chinese want when we order fried rice; white rice seasoned primarily by salt. Simple. Clean. Delicious.  The shrimp, pork and chive dumpling filling melted in your mouth but the HAND MADE dumpling skin was absolutely the star. The skin was perfectly al dente. Nothing beats hand made pasta. Because they are hand made, it does take a little bit of wait time. But the wait was very much worth it. The dumplings come 10 per order. Perfect single order for those wishing a little snack. Also perfect for family and friends wishing to share and try several different dumplings.  Finally, the piece de resistance, our order of Xiao Long Bao or soup dumplings. Each delectable, steamy and soothing bite-size pouches of goodness is the very reason that draws the masses to this wonderfully unpretentious but excellent jewel time after time. The broth within each dumpling is just right. The pork filling melts in your mouth and, again, the hand made dumpling or bao skin is perfectly al dente. Sure, if you have eaten Xiao Long Bao at the famous Din Tai Feng chains, Xiao Long Bao at Chou's has a bit of catching up. BUT, it doesn't matter. Excellence is excellence. Xiao Long Bao at Chou's will make you want to go back time and time again.   My wife and I left very satisfied. Our bill for all the food? Just a bit over $22. I love it. We will most definitely return again. And we will also try out the original Chandler location. Chou's Kitchen, definitely one of the best northeastern style Chinese comfort food in the greater Phoenix area, a must go."}
{"text":"I had given up on ever finding great Chinese food in Arizona. Chous is not only the greatest in the state, but I would venture to say the best I've ever had anywhere!  Seriously!  Their beef pies are the best, every time we go (which is pretty often now) we get beef pies and some kind of eggplant dish-- either the eggplant, potato and jalapeno or eggplant in brown sauce.   Other favorites on the menu are beef friend rice, any of the pies or dumplings, and beef noodles. You can't go wrong with ANYTHING you order, even the fish is great. This place has become our new favorite, not just favorite Chinese but one of our all time favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"Posted hours say they close at 9pm. A friend and I came in at about 8:20pm. Waitress looks at us and says \"it's late we close soon\". Alright so to be courteous decided to take it to go. Mind you there were 4 other tables who were just getting food. They were very much still open and serving things. After placing the order waitress says \"late dinner\" \"It's really late\". Alright we said. Got our food handed to us once again says \"it's late\". We left 15 min before close while 3 other tables still sat. Food is good but hospitality completely absent."}
{"text":"It's ok. Really nice lady at the register. I ordered shrimp noodles, shrimp fried rice, hot and sour soup, and sweet and sour chicken TO GO. The thing is, when I walked in there was only ONE family eating. It was a Caucasian family and the plates were filled to the max! It looked like they had massive portions! I got excited because I was starving and was excited to try a new place. I had driven 23 miles to get there because of the reviews. The food itself was OK, not bad but the shrimp fried rice was like just white rice with eggs and shrimp and some green onions and peas thrown in. It didn't look authentic and it was kind bland. Sweet and sour soup was ok, not bad but I've definitely had way better. Sweet and sour pork was similar to Panda Express, nothing to write home about. But what was worse was the portions... they were SOOO SMALL! I ended up paying $36.40 ($2 tip) for the 3 items and it was not very much food at all. So my advice would be, if you are going to eat here, do not order to go because the portions were really small. I don't think it is enough for even 2 people to fill up on and for the price, it wasn't horrible but I would think a fair price for such a small amount of food should be $26 at the most. Glad I tried it but not worth the price and drive in my opinion."}
{"text":"Spotless!!! Very impressed! Excellent food first rate service.  Went today for first time after recommended by my barber Husain at Terminal Barbershop (best shop in valley).  Am disappointed that this was first time for Chou's Kitchen for us. We should have been going long before this.  Can't wait to go back.  Will be regular spot for us."}
{"text":"1.  As most others have noted in one form or another, this is not Americanized Chinese food.  Not a bad thing, just an observation who those who think what they normally eat is actually \"Chinese\" food.  Adjust your expectations accordingly.  2.  Most of the food seems to be very greasy/oily...more so than most other places you would eat Chinese food (regardless of authenticity).  3.  Not really the cleanest of places.  Because of the amount of grease/oil in the food the tables pick up a lot of the grease/oil and floating dust.  4.  Soda is served by the can...not the fountain.  Again, not a bad thing, just an observation.  5.  When the kitchen fan is running its really loud.  6.  I got a mild case of bubble guts.   Probably related to item 2 above.  Not really a 3 in my book, but higher than a 2"}
{"text":"I've never given a restaurant 5-stars before. We started with the pork & shrimp dumplings, so good. Their special ribs were perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked. The eggplant in garlic sauce was incredible"}
{"text":"First time here have been wanting to try this for a while.  Started off with the Pork Xiao Long Bao, Pork Pot Stickers, Braised Ribs, Yangzhou Fried Rice and Toothpick Lamb.  The Xiao Long Bao were good with the soup hot but not too hot, average to small in size.  The Pork Pot Stickers were very doughy and expected to be more pan friend but was soggy, would not recommend.  The Braised Ribs were very good and nice to eat with white rice because of the sauce on the ribs.  The Yangzhou Fried Rice was pretty good with alot of items mixed in like eggs, shrimp, a crispy chicken and veggies.  Probably one of the better dishes was the Toothpick Lamb which had a nice rub on the lamb and was interesting to share and eat.  Overall, pretty good and a little on the expensive side. Don't know if I would call the restaurant a little hole in the wall or not.  Will probably come back again to try other dishes."}
{"text":"I haven't been back here for years and figured I would give it another try. This time, we were sitting right next to the kitchen. It was much easier to get helped when needed.   The famous steamed dumpling (???) is still as good as always. So was the wonton soup. I honestly did not care for the other noodle dish I ordered (it is called ??? in Chinese). The noodle was too thick and the sauce was not flavaorble. I feel bad to kick it back so I basically just threw them away after taking the rest home.  The service has definitely improved alot from the last time I was here. The restaurant is still a bit warm but I think it's inevitable. The place is small with dumplings steaming every hour. Be prepared to sweat when you are here."}
{"text":"This place is getting worse and worse. Don't spend a penny here. Esp today's foods are worst. Every xiao long bao in plate are tear apart when they came out. Other pot is also crappy. I have liked this place like more than 3 yrs, but this is it. This will be the last time."}
{"text":"Mmmmm, potstickers, buns, dumplings, meat pies.  I can't get enough.  And less than 1 mile from my house!  Where have you been all my life Chou?  And my favorite was the eggplant stirfry with potatoes and jalapenos.  Wow!   The service is great, the 2 women that took our order and brought the food were nice and funny.   Where else can you get a waitress that tells my 5 year old that he needs to drink water instead of juice because juice will make him \"fluffy\"  (how sweet and PC) and his belly will get big?  Or how about when the other lady asked me if I had been to China, and when I indicated I hadn't she told me \"you don't need to go, you come here\".   So good food with a side of comedy.  My new favorite restaurant."}
