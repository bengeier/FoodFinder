{"text":"Won't be back, had the shrimp pizza and a pasta dish that I forgot before I even finished it, service was below par and the place was even dead, giving the place the benefit of the doubt, maybe it was just an off night?. But I won't be back."}
{"text":"This was a surprise. I ordered a pizza and peperoni rolls because of the reviews. Best peperoni rolls, I personally ever had. The pizza was different but a good different, felt lighter, a little dry. I recommend more sauce and it would of been a five star pie. Still giving four stars because of the taste, I recommend asking for extra sauce. On yelp it does say delivery and I can't stress enough on the disappointment they DO NOT deliver, keep that in mind. 4 stars, keep up the good work! I recommend if you're in the area to give this place a shot."}
{"text":"I am from the Dayton area and was visiting the Parma area. I had dinner (and lunch) at Verso. All I can say is \"wow\"! Pizza at lunch was fantastic. Dinner was even better. All of the food was very authentic. The \"rock and roll\" pictures on the wall really added to the fun atmosphere. I had the pleasure to meet and talk with the owners and found them to be extremely warm and friendly. They were genuinely concerned about the quality and flavor of their food.  I would highly recommend Verso's. I will definitely return if I am back in that area."}
{"text":"Have been here a half a dozen times and it is consistently good every time... the food comes out pretty quick, the waitresses are always attentive, and most importantly the food is great.  Have had the lasagna, pizza, meatball sandwich, chicken parm sandwich, antipasto salad, and a few others and would recommend everyone of them."}
{"text":"I've been there a few times, always good.  looking forward to trying more items on the menu. Verso and Eggplant sandwiches are terrific!"}
{"text":"The pluses: wonderful salad mix and balsamic vinaigrette dressing; superb, homemade yeast rolls; delightful Hawaiian pizza; above average chicken marsala; good prices; attentive waitress; nice menu selections; cool vibe and decor.  The minuses: stained and dirty carpeting at 11:30 a.m. on a Saturday.  Must have been a busy Friday night crowd."}
{"text":"Great food. Great staff. Classic Rock and Roll. What more could you ask for. The Verso sandwich is one of the best things I've ever eaten. The chips are made to order and the ranch dressing is fantastic. All the portions are huge. You will not leave hungry and let's not forget the staff. Ashley made our visit even better. Great value."}
{"text":"The service was very good...but the chicken marsala was not...chicken overcooked and sauce scorched...spaghetti was soft and limp.   They offered to fix another dish or discount..I choose the discount which was 1/3 off...should have been complementary...will not go back."}
{"text":"I have been here before and this time I got carry out. I got a pepperoni roll and some Verso chips which are homemade seasoned potato chips with a side of ranch dressing. The pepperoni roll was okay but not amazing. I couldn't taste a lot of pepperoni. The dough was very soft and the mozzarella cheese was good but I wish there would've been more pepperoni in it.   The Verso chips were okay but definitely don't get them if they're just for you, they give you a huge order. Half of the chips were not completely fried so they looked a bit sketchy. I'd be a bit more understanding about the chips if the place was packed but it wasn't.  I'll definitely go back but try other stuff. They're food is good but I haven't had anything yet that's great."}
{"text":"We have been there many time and their pizza is great with many choices. Service is fast and the servers are very nice. I would recommend this to anyone. Prices are very competitive."}
{"text":"Verso has been on my radar for a while.  Finally visited for dinner last night with some relatives.  The space is clean and I love that the tables aren't too cramped.  They also have an excellent changing table in the women's restroom (the hook to hang the diaper bag is soooo useful but so often not present).    We had the Thursday night family special - large pizza, pasta, salad for about $23.  It was a ton of food and a great value.  I really liked the pizza cheese and the salad.  The house dressing is excellent.  The pasta sauce and pizza crust weren't my favorite, but they weren't terrible.  We saw a calzone come out to another table, and it was enormous!  I would definitely come back here to try some other things on the menu, and also highly recommend the family deal on Thursday nights.  And they use fresh, not canned mushrooms!  :)"}
{"text":"After driving by all the time, my wife and I were looking for some good Italian food close to home, that WAS NOT a chain (hey, I'm talking to you Olive Garden!) so we decided to give Verso a try. I was pleasantly surprised that they make some really solid Italian fare.  We got takeout rather then dining in. The inside is small yet cozy, with walls adorned with rock heroes and guitars.  I love me some Pappardelle w/ Bolognese-it was good but could have been great with some more seasoning in the sauce, which besides the meat was very bland.  The Stromboli was huge, but again was kind of blah.  The housemate chips with carmelized onion dip, were addictive!  The Verso Sandwich was yummy, especially the roasted red peppers.  Besides some hiccups, I think we will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Very friendly and attentive servers and great food. Love their dinner salad with house dressing, pizza, pasta dishes... Haven't had a bad dish yet. The restaurant is just one open space with booths, high-tops, and regular tables. It's not very large so big groups would definitely need to give them advance notice. Also, could get noisy if packed. Overall though, it's a hidden gem in Parma."}
{"text":"Great restaurant! They have lots of Italian options, Stromboli, pasta carbonara, chicken marsala. The restaurant smelled amazing. My family and I were looking for a quick pizza before before going to the movies. We were all happily satisfied. We ordered a deluxe for the adults and a cheese for the kids. They had a special today (Sunday) where the cost for a large ($18) was the cost of a medium ($15). So we saved $6 on some awesome pizza! The older kids really enjoyed the pizza crust, said it was an 11 out of 10. I really enjoyed the sausage on the deluxe. It was fresh and you could tell by taste and the shape.  Quick tip: if you are looking for fundraising opportunities this restaurant does a dine to donate and will give your organization 20%."}
{"text":"I enjoyed coming here on Thursdays for the family night special -large salad, large pizza, a big bowl of pasta to share and choice of beverage for 24ish dollars. Last time we went, we didn't get the best service, server was inattentive and forgot our appetizer, and the food has typically been much better in the past. Maybe they were just having an off day and under staffed, but I would probably try again one day in the future if they went back to their old standard of service."}
{"text":"we just stopped by for dinner on the way to a movie. ordered a spinach artichoke dip and a veggie pizza. some observations: - the chips that came with the dip were super hot and freshly made.  - the pizza dough was really soft and the entire pizza was well cooked - cheese on the pizza felt very fresh.   The place looks very normal with a rock and roll theme to it. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Verso is a great, small, local restaurant. The food is outstanding and the prices on everything is very reasonable. I have sampled many different items on the menu varying from the calzones, to the pizzas, and some various pasta dishes, and have not been disappointed yet. The real secret of this restaurant is their daily specials which are outstanding deals. We like to go for their deal on Friday, two medium one topping pizzas for $12.99, which is available for take out as well. Combine the two medium pizzas, and a house salad with citrus basil dressing and one of their delectable rolls that accompanies the salad, and you've got an unbeatable price to quality ratio for a meal. The restaurant is quite small on the inside, but has a very modern feel, and is much more open than many other restaurants in a small space. Definitely a great place for local eats that I would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"From the street, it doesn't look like much. Small parking lot with a beet up sign. But once inside, the atmosphere is great. Very clean and simple. The tables are spread out nicely, unlike many other smaller establishments.   The food was very good and reasonably priced. Was able to get two dinners, two salads, bread, and 2 glasses of wine for less than $40. The food seemed fresh with authentic ingredients. Will definetally be added to our favorites list of restaraunts."}
{"text":"Awesome food! One would not think thank Parma would be a place to go for good Italian food. If you are ever wanting a great little cozy place for Italian, go to Verso. Good place for a decent sized group for lunch or dinner. Our group tonight had 9 people and it was perfect, as we could have added more if needed. This is a must try!"}
{"text":"delicious pizza, great atmosphere. we came in late afternoon on a weekend and were served right away. prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"Margarita pizza is NOT good. Extremely boring has almost no flavor. Their pricing is completely off. They should cut them in half"}
{"text":"I love this place. I get a really cool vibe every time I walk in. Is it the pictures of the classic rockers on the walls? The classic rock tunes they have playing? The friendly hostess? The candles on the table? The clean and inviting atmosphere? Yes. Yes it is. Its an intimate dining room, with a few booths and a lot of tables. TVs to watch local sports on, Magic Hat #9, and and  gooey, cheesy, hot, pizza galore. What more does a yelpette need? The service is really good too and my pet peeve of not having refills is not rearing its ugly head today, because I always had refills.  While I love a good ol' slice of pizza as much as the next girl (and their pizza is really good! My fellow yelpers have established that already.), I'm gonna talk about the salad for a second. Oh my.... The balsamic salad dressing is AMAZING. If it was socially acceptable, I'd eat it with a spoon. If they bottled it, I would definitely buy it.   I'll talk about the catering too. We had this place cater my sister's grad party and the service was excellent! We got pasta (It was ok. I didn't eat a lot of it.), salad (with the balsamic dressing Awwwww yeeeeaaaahh....), and fried chicken galore. That chicken is probably some of the best chicken I've ever had from a catered dinner. Juicy, tender, well seasoned... the TRIFECTA of fried chicken. We had so much left over that I ate chicken and salad for at least 2 weeks afterwards. We got a lot for the price.   A lot of people say that Parma is a black hole for culture or anything good in general, but I have to say that if you're in town, Verso should be on your list of places to stop.  Note: I'm not sure if they sell the fried chicken on the regular menu, but if you're getting catering, order it for sure."}
{"text":"Tried this place out and loved it! Moved to the area about a year ago and haven't found a good pizza place like this one!  We got the Hawaiian 5.0 pizza pepperoni rolls and spinach dip! Everything was fantastic. Will keep coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Good prices and good food. They have some deals each weeknight. Good pizza and good mozz sticks. A nice cozy atmosphereI wish they had a better beer selection though. That is the main reason we don't come here so often. They usually do have a great lakes beer though so I'll get that."}
{"text":"I checked the website the other night & the special was \"Buy one entree, get one half off\". My husband & I decided on our order AND had a back up order incase it was a dining room only special. When I called, I specifically mentioned the special and asked this question. I was told it was valid on take out. Fast forward 20 minutes, at CVS they call to tell me it wasn't valid on take out. When I ask if I can change my order, they at first said no, then yes. So I placed the back up order. Sigh. Honestly, honor your word, and when we picked it up, tell us going forward it's dine in only. The call was tacky. However, I have to say, the calzones we got were amazing. So although annoying, we will go back."}
{"text":"Stopped in with clients for lunch and also ordered some take out for a meeting.  I opted for the 9\" Tuscan veggie pizza. It had a good amount of vegetables which tasted fresh. The dough was a little chewy but it had a nice flavor. My guests reported that there salads were good (they appeared quite large). The take out pizza was all eaten by the time I finished my meeting at their office so it is safe to assume that was enjoyed as well.  Prices were reasonable and service was attentive."}
{"text":"Good food, intimate atmosphere.  Service was a little slow."}
{"text":"I love going there for a quick meal. They have good food; waldorf salad and stromboli mmm. ."}
{"text":"First time here. Charming little place with great food, reasonable prices, and excellent, friendly service!!!"}
{"text":"Four of us to dinner, had the prosciutto pizza which seemed like  good choice no flavor....2 had the  Alfredo Florentine pasta, again no flavor.  So disappointed, yuck!"}
{"text":"Our favorite pizza place in Cleveland. And there are a lot of really good pizza places in Cleveland. Unique pizzas and great stromboli. If you've never had a stromboli you should rectify that immediately.  Funny story, my wife was pregnant with our third child last fall and we went to Verso for her fav stromboli and had the baby two hours later. So it even induces labor!"}
{"text":"This place has a BYO pasta, which is one of the reasons why I love this place!  Comes with a side salad (unless you want soup instead) and delicious garlic rolls.  Best place in Parma to eat in or dine out at!"}
{"text":"I originally saw this establishment on a recording of the Robin Swoboda show...it looked really good.  I decided to visit one day and try the sausage stuffed peppers and they did not have them so I left...  After a few months I was able to return with my significant other for an early dinner  The inside of the restaurant is somewhat eclectic; I truly enjoyed the dark colors, rock memorabilia as well as music playing. Our waitress was nice and promptly took our appetizer order.  We ordered stuffed sausage for the appetizer.  When stuffed peppers came out they were very fresh...sauce was fairly acidic but tasted really good in combinations with the cheese, sausage, & pepper.  I have to say, I thought the portion of the sausage was a bit on the small side but the food itself tasted good.  When the waitress brought out the app. she took our orders which were Chicken parmesan and eggplant parmesan.  These dishes included Salad, which my girlfriend was offered cheese for, as well as she chose a different sauce besides spaghetti which I believe was basil.  I kept it simple with spaghetti noodles and sauce.  When the dishes were served I noticed the unique display of the food...the chicken was thinly cut with light breading and cheese on top.  The eggplant parmesan was lightly bread and rolled and stuffed with ricotta and topped with parmesan cheese.  The dishes were good tasting.  The sauce was vibrant, much like the sauce with the peppers.  We had some things to do, so we did not opt for dessert.  We were a bit taken back at the bill of 40.00. The food was good, but the price seemed to be a bit out of place for portions/quality.  I was also thrown back by the fact there was an upcharge for cheese on the salad which we weren't told about until we asked.  The restaurant was good, and I would go back however I would try some different plates and try to watch the price points a little bit.  I hear the pizza is good and pictures of the other dishes look fantastic as well."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in parma. Food is good, service is good. Don't come here to drink beer because the selection is a little low, but the execellent food more than makes up for it."}
{"text":"Very small place. Servers were nice. I got apps to go and they were ready when I got there. I got the chips and dip loaded no meat,  and the spinach dip. Was amazing. Should have charged maybe $1 less for no meat but still. All in all will get again!!"}
{"text":"We drove past Verso quite a few times before we remembered to go there last night. The restaurant is small but spacious; the walls are covered in an odd selection of photos of famous musicians in almost an ode to the Rock Hall. Most surprising is the four flat screen TVs for the relatively small space.   We started with the Verso Loaded Chips: house made potato chips with provolone, bacon, green onion and garlic ranch sauce for dipping. I am a sucker for house made potato chips and these were delicious. They had reached that perfect balance of crunchy/chewy toothsomeness. There was a generous amount of cheese and nice hunks of bacon and green onion garnishing the top. The garlic ranch dipping sauce ended up being a very pleasant surprise; it blended the slightly sweet, cool, creamy ranch with the robust tang of the garlic. It was really delicious!  I had a small P.P.G. pizza. The small is a good size for a single person with left overs or for two people to share. P.P.G. stands for Potato, Prosciutto and Garlic. It had a lot of garlic. A lot. I am still tasting the garlic a day later. The crust was good, as was the prosciutto and small cubed potatoes, but the minced garlic really ruled the dish. I like garlic, so I didn't mind, but this is really a Must LOVE Garlic pizza.   My fiance had the chicken parmesan sandwich. It came with a side of the house made chips, although I did hear another table substitute their chips for a salad. It was a nice sized sandwich on thick ciabatta bread; the main thing that we both agreed on is that the breading needed more salt or seasoning in general. It was a little flat, but still tasty.  Overall, I would definitely go back. The timing was really perfect and we had a nice, leisurely, casual Italian dinner. I would go back to try out some of their other specialty pizzas."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times, very close to my new neighborhood in Seven Hills.   Cozy, rock music themed decor, nice selection of '70s-80s rock on the sound system.  The chicken parm was ample sized and tasty.   On another visit, they had a deal on medium pizzas..had one, tasty, decent crust and toppings.   Good beer and wine selection.  Recommended."}
{"text":"Order the pizza rolls. They are a staple every time! I love going here for lunch (sometimes they can be slow since they only have one or two servers max at a time). I've gotten something different (with the exception of the pizza rolls) and have liked majority of it! The spaghetti is usually too watered down but one of my faves is chicken parm. Cute little place!"}
{"text":"Came here to post that the Hawaii 5.0 and the Caribbean pizzas here are absolutely to die for. There is just nothing like either of them anywhere in Cleveland that I know of, chains like dominos/pizza hut won't even get close, and California Pizza Kitchen has sub par variations. The garlic knots and the pizza come out pipping hot and fresh, literally cannot go wrong. I really need to start coming here way more often than I already do"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Italian place hands down.  They do charity nights, have great specials, and their food is so fresh.  Their sauce is DIVINE.  Favorite go-tos: eggplant parm with the pasta to go because it's hugeeeee Tuesday lasagna night for my meat-eating husband.  8 bucks and you get a huge piece of lasagna, bread, and a large salad.  He also likes the barbecue chicken strombolli  My fav salad is the mango one without chicken and cheese.  It's sweet and spicy and filling.  YOU MUST TRY THE GARLIC KNOTS!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza. Staff is hard working and pretty fast. It looks like a joint from the street, but actually it's nice, but simple inside. I've never been there after 7:00, so have. No idea about the nighttime crowd."}
{"text":"Overall, the service was good, the food was very good, and the menu had many things that seemed appetizing - for under $40 we had a good meal, leftovers and a beer.  My wife and I ate there this evening around 7p on a Friday. The small place was nicer inside than it looked from the strip, with hip and warm decor, but not busy at all.   I started with a Great Lakes Christmas Ale (how can you not) - from their modest bottled selection ($4) which included GLBC Dortmunder and Magic Hat #9. The waitress brought a small basket of fresh rolls which were very good.  I had their Italian Wedding Soup which is made fresh there daily, which I don't dispute. It was great, and a generous portion for $4. My wife's salad was very good as well, a nice mixed-greens salad with baby spinach, tomatoes and shredded cheese; t he house balsamic was very tasty as well ($4 a la carte, but included with her entree).  I ordered a medium 12\" bbq chicken pizza ($15). My standards are high for specialty pizzas like this, but it was good. A small would have been plenty but I wanted tat least 1/2 to take home for lunch the next day. I almost always need to order a side of bbq sauce, and this was no exception. The dough was very good, light and chewy. I could have used some fresh cilantro on top, and green or red onions instead of white (a bit oniony for my tastes), but still good. They had some really interesting toppings to choose from and a variety of specialty pizzas - more than a few sounded great.  My wife enjoyed her spaghetti marinara ($11 with salad or soup and bread) - the sauce was nice, although the pasta wasn't drained quite enough. The menu had quite a few sauces to choose from (vodka, alfredo, etc.) as well as other pastas ($1.50 more) gnocchi, cavatelli and whole wheat penne to substitue as well as meatballs and sausage ($2).   The service was adequate - quick but out of the way- no real complaints there.  All in all, for $36 + tax and tip (with plenty of leftovers for lunch) the value was very good and the dining experience was great for the price and location. We'll be back soon."}
{"text":"tried it for the first time a few weeks ago. Waitress informed us they were out of cheese (at a pizza place...at a pizza place close to giant eagle). ordered a speciality pizza...came out an hour later with guess what...no cheese... although waitress told us that they went to go get cheese, the pizza we received was very sparsely topped with both specialty toppings and cheese. worse while we waited an hour for our extremely delayed pizza, the waitress was nowhere to be found to take drink orders. the wait-staff was comprised of what seemed to be all high-school kids, along with the kitchen...accordingly the service and food quality was that of someone who wasn't concerned about the quality of the product they were delivering. seems like the owner would want to be more involved seeing that verso is a new establishment, but i guess he/she is not concerned... this may have been an off night for them, but i'll never know since i won't be going back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner with my boyfriend. We got the awesome buffalo chicken salad and shared the delicious Wednesday night $5 pizza.   I didn't care for the large portrait of Tina Turner at our table. In it, she was giving me disgusted side-eye, like \"You're seriously gonna have another piece of pizza?\"  It was pretty inexpensive and everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"My wife and I dined here on a Friday night with high hopes, and left very disappointed.  We were seated right away as there were only three other parties dining when we arrived.  We put our drink order in and these were brought out right away.  After we ordered our meals we were promptly brought some delectable bread.  That's when it started to go downhill.    About another 25 minutes passed before my wife's Waldorf salad and my tomato mozzarella salad were brought out.  During this time our server did not once check on us or offer drink refills.  My wife enjoyed the Waldorf but my salad was definitely underwhelming for the $8 price tag.  The \"mixed greens\" advertised on the menu turned out to be iceberg lettuce, and the red onions were sliced in large chunks instead of thin slices.  Not to mention, the portion was very small (I know, fresh mozzarella isn't cheap).  I muscled through and looked forward to the main course.  My wife ordered eggplant parmesan with a side of gnocchi marinara.  I ordered the gnocchi a la carte with sausage and pesto cream sauce.  Both of these dishes were delicious and well worth the price, but again, the service was painfully slow considering the light volume of diners in the establishment at the time, and our server rarely surfaced from the kitchen and did not exhibit a pleasant disposition when we did see her.  We counted three servers tending to four tables; all tables seemed to be subject to slow service, but not all of them suffered from inattention the way we did.  Maybe they were doing a brisk take out business that night, but it resulted in poor service for those dining in the restaurant  I also want to add that there seemed to be a disturbing number of fruit flies hovering around our table all night. This was perhaps the most disappointing aspect of our experience. My wife and I each killed about three flies and there were others we didn't catch.  A former bar manager herself, my wife chalked this up to the alcohol containers not being sealed tightly overnight.  Perhaps we will give them another chance but it will be a long time."}
{"text":"I drove by this place a thousand time going to and from work and thought \"Looks cute, but it's Parma... how good could it be?!\" and never really gave it much more thought. Well, that is until I was desperate to not cook and I forced the husband to meet me there for dinner.  And I have to admit.  It's REALLY GOOD.  The inside of the place is cute, with pictures of rockers on the walls and just enough seating to not feel crowded.  The menu has lots of options - pizza, pasta, appetizers.  The drink options aren't very extensive (but they're cheap so I won't complain too much!)  I tried the pappardelle bolognese and the husband had some sort of pizza with weird vegetables and we both loved our dinners.  Our favorite part of dinner was the pepperoni roll appetizer that we shared (so good!)  The best part was that it was under $40! Not too bad!  And I feel bad for giving them such a hard time for being in Parma."}
{"text":"Wow!  I have to admit, I didn't think that this place would be as good as it reviews suggested. There is just something about a random pizza place in Cleveland that doesn't inspire much. But boy, was I wrong!  We ordered four smallish pizzas and they were pretty darn good. My sister loved the Caribbean style pizza, I was enamored with my Shrimp pizza, and my parents loved the pepperoni and mushroom they ordered. I think the only thing that wasn't up to par was the margarita pizza. It just seemed like it had too much cheese on it for the amount of crust and sauce.   Overall I was way impressed. And I said to my sister right after eating that I wished we had gotten a bigger shrimp pizza, since I liked it so much!"}
{"text":"So...everything is delicious...really great food! I highly recommend the loaded chips and the fried provolone...they are the BOMB!!! I have had several items on the menu in the past and have been really pleased - but that comes to an end. Because their burgers are OUTSTANDING!!! I just can't bring myself to order anything else. I literally DREAM about these burgers. Maybe the best...no, definitely, the best I've ever had. There's something special about this burger. I'm a terrible Yelper. I always forget to leave reviews...but I had to because of these burgers.   Service and atmosphere are friendly and great."}
