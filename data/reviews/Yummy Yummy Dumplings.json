{"text":"This is a quaint, hole-in-the-wall, mom and pops type of place. It's usually not very busy, which baffles me cause they make the best damn baos & dumplings in the city. The owners are very personable and friendly, although there are a few communication problems if you don't speak mandarin. 

As someone who has had fresh off the steamer bao from vendors in China, I can vouch that this is probably going to be as good as it gets for authentic food in Toronto. I am pretty sure their the flour is home made, and bonus points for their Green Onion Pancakes that doesn't taste like someone dropped the salt while making it.

Edit: 
Pro-tip : be patient or speak mandarin since there might be a language barrier when ordering online!"}
{"text":"Best dumplings in Chinatown. Had pork and chive boiled dumplings. Very fresh and affordable."}
{"text":"This place made me happy.  The owners were pleasant.  Everything that came to our table was fresh and good.  Fabulous pancakes, cold beef, steamed and fried dumplings.  I wish they were closer."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall, yes. No frills, sure. But really great dumplings for a great price. Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"3.5 stars
I went in middle of the afternoon on a Wednesday. The place was empty so I got prompt service. It's a clean place with a cozy atmosphere.
I ordered tea, hot & sour soup, boiled shrimp/pork/chive dumplings, and fried pancake with chives.
The tea was slightly different from what most places would serve. I can't say it's bad, but I wasn't expecting it, and it's not to my preference. Unfortunately, I don't know enough about tea to figure out what it was.
The soup was fine. Nothing special, in fact it tasted slightly bland or watered compared to others I've had. But nothing wrong with it either.
The pancake was unremarkable. Reminded me too much of the premade frozen ones.
The dumplings were good. I was surprised to find a whole shrimp inside each one, rather than just a small amount chopped and mixed with the pork. The filling/wrapping ratio is also decent. I didn't feel cheated.

I wouldn't go out of my way for this place, but it's a good choice for an inexpensive snack or meal if in the area. Probably would be better with a small group to take advantage of the variety of dumplings."}
{"text":"Remember how cheap and good Mother's Dumpling used to be when it was at this location?
Well, you dont have to remember because you can just go to Yum Yums. Their lamb and carrot dumplings are so good, they will rock your balls (ovaries) off."}
{"text":"Yummy Yummy Dumpling certainly lives up to its name! I came here for dinner with my husband on our last night in Toronto, and it impressed us so much that we came back the next day before we left to get brunch! Each dumpling is handmade with care and cooked to perfection - I really liked how the wrappers for each type of dumpling (steamed, boiled, and fried) are made differently for each different cooking method yielding crisp potstickers, delicate and toothsome steamed dumplings, and tender and tasty boiled dumplings. We also ordered some appetizers while we waited as the owner made our dumplings - all the vegetables were nicely seasoned and incredibly fresh. Overall, a wonderfully homey and delicious meal - I wished that we could have bought a bag of their frozen dumplings to take home!"}
{"text":"Got a groupon for the restaurant and tried it out! At first the dumplings was good but every other dish was mediocre and verging on disgusting when the bowl of stew meat was served in a bowl of pure OIL. But that was all ok, until we got the bill. For such small portion they sure are EXPENSIVE! The groupon does not have any fine print does not specifically state that it exclude tax upon paying. They charged us the tax for the full value of the meal not the promotional value we purchase which is $71 vs $29. Just imagined our shock when it comes and we are charged with $13 tax. To add it all off when we inquired about it the owner rudely told us to read carefully the groupon voucher and you know what WE DID and IT SAYS NOTHING OF THE THING. This has got to be one of the WORSE RESTAURANT ever. Never would go back again because it is a money greedy restaurant with no sense of business ethics."}
{"text":"SO yummy yummy. A hidden gem and much tastier than Mothers and MUCH cleaner than Dumpling House.
Green onion Pancake is so good. As are the dumplings and steamed buns."}
{"text":"Ordered ahead for pick up. Was told it was not ready when I showed up at pick up time. I asked how much longer and was told 20 mins and now it's 30mins later and still waiting....not good especially when one is in a rush! Haven't tried the food yet but already unhappy. And they did not even apologize. Should have just cancelled the order..."}
{"text":"Really looked forward to these Northern Chinese style handmade dumplings. They make the dumplings to order and they quality is great. We had the chive pancakes, shrimp and cabbage pan fried dumplings, and the pork and pickle steamed dumplings. The quality and texture was excellent. Be warned though, grouponnow has vouchers, but there are restrictions that aren't listed online that you need to ask about when you're there. Service is nonexistent as in there are no servers. It's just the husband and wife and the husband disappeared for a very long time on a delivery. Do not come here expecting speed and service. Highly recommend getting delivery."}
{"text":"Great presentation, quick and efficient service, amazing dumplings!

I have been twice in a short period because I loved the steamed dumplings so much. We had the melon and egg, which was by far the best, and also the vermicelli and mushroom and chive and mushroom."}
{"text":"the dumplings were passable but portion size is relatively smaller to other places. I also ordered the zha jiang noode.....what a disappointment! It was nothing like whats described on the menu. I was given thick white noodles rather than buckwheat noodles, there was no scallions, cilantro and egg. The sauce was way too salty."}
{"text":"This place has the best dumplings in downtown Toronto. I love the pork and chives dumplings where boiled or fried, green onion pancake and beef rolls. 

Way better than Mother's Dumplings or Dumpling House. It might be a small restaurant but it's clean, good value for money and with friendly service and good food! Don't forget to bring cash."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday evening. The place was empty, which was surprising given the high ratings on here. We had wonton soup, which was weak for broth but wontons were good. Also had a variety of dumplings and steamy buns, which were good also. Not sure if I'd go out if my way to come back but it hits the spot when dim sum is needed."}
{"text":"Found this gem today. On my walk home I just so happened to be craving dumplings and stumbled into this place. Really authentic dumplings. I had the pork and chives. They were so soft and rich with flavour. Also had the cucumber salad. Smashed and tasty with so much sesame dressing.


This place is a real nice hidden gem."}
{"text":"Dumplings were delicious, lots of food at a decent price. The service was fast as well. No compliaints."}
{"text":"amazingly good! 
very friendly owner with super delicious well done dumplings and many other dishes! 

no MSG and very fresh ingredients, as dumpling master I have to say they are the best. Better than mother's dumpling and dumpling house.

Please go for it! 

The dough is just at the best taste made with perfect strength. The feeling is just so fresh and tasty without MSG."}
{"text":"My brother in law found this place for us through Yelp. At first glance once we stepped into the place, I wasn't overly impressed. But then again, I should've known better than to judge a restaurant in Chinatown by the decor and ambience. 

Once the dumplings came out, I was so impressed with the taste and homemade quality of the dumplings. I usually go to House of Dumplings or Mothers Dumplings for my fix but this one is not as busy/loud and the food tastes just as good if not better. 

It does take a little longer for the food to come out relative to some other places I've been but I suspect it's because they're making the Dumplings fresh which I prefer over frozen anyday!"}
{"text":"Found this thru yelp and was excited to try since I was craving for dumplings. We called to order for pick up. When we got there after 15 mins order was ready and still hot. 
Yelp didnt disappoint. Food was really good and the service as well. We had the pork buns and steamed pork/shrimp/chives. We enjoyed them both. Next time we'll dine in and enjoy the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Excellent dumplings!  You can tell that everything's handmade--we didn't see the staff making them, but there was plenty of variation in the way they were all folded together, which is charming.

The Northeastern salad, a pile of julienned cucumber, carrot, red cabbage and noodles with a mustard dressing, was delicious and a very refreshing start to the meal.  We ordered a good selection of dumplings: fried shrimp, pork, and chive; steamed whole wheat turnip (the whole wheat wrappers are great and complement the earthy turnip filling very well); boiled chicken and mushroom; and boiled pork and dill.  When I got there the place was empty, but it filled up as we ate--this place deserves to be popular!"}
{"text":"I just made a 5km walk for these dumplings. When it come to amazing food I am willing to put in the effort even in winter. I need to visit this place more in the summer time!!!!"}
{"text":"i went here the other night and have since recommended it to pretty much anyone I've come into contact with - SO GOOD and VERY AFFORDABLE! 

the staff were sweet and the food came out quickly. we ordered the seaweed salad, shredded potato salad,  beef & celery steamed buns, cabbage & mushroom pan fried, chive pockets, and another veggie dumpling (oups i forget) and it was all well cooked and delicious! and for 26$! 

you really can't go wrong here. excellent veggie options. nice spicy dishes.  great place to bring family and friends; nice atmosphere. well definitely be a regular here."}
{"text":"What a lovely little spot! The food definitely lives up to the restaurant name. Stepping inside is refreshing - you feel like you've found a truly authentic and welcoming spot, which certainly was the case.

Visited for supper and wasn't disappointed. We tried pork dumplings both panfried and boiled - both great options. They have a steamed option as well. Dumplings are what they are famous for, but the menu also has several other options such as salads, soup, and pork buns. 

Food is perfectly priced and the service is prompt and friendly. They even have free wifi. Would just know ahead of time that they only accept cash. Will definitely be back for more dumplings!"}
{"text":"Bait and switch at this restaurant. We jumped on the groupon now deal stating that we were able to get $20 worth of dishes for $10. We made the trek out on a rainy December day to find this place (a hole in the wall off the beaten path).

When we got there, we were told that we couldn't use the groupon because their \"computer was broken.\" Not impressed..."}
{"text":"Ordered take out from them through just-eat.ca, and was incredibly impressed with the quality of food. Unlike a lot of other order out places, they got my order perfectly with no mistakes. Dumplings were perfectly cooked, tasted very fresh, and their chive pockets were especially excellent. Not too oily like other restaurants, and you can't beat they're prices compared to other dumpling places, even ones nearby. Chive pancake was a little too light on the chives, but still very flavourful.

I would easily recommend this place over Mothers Dumplings, and would order from them again."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night after a movie since dumplings sounded good. This place is pretty hidden on the street and you have to watch your step on the stairs. I guess Google maps wanted us to walk around a bit. 

The food itself was good! I got the pan fried chicken, cabbage and I think mushroom dumplings, an order of pork skewers, spicy Tofu, Xiao long bao, and a bowl of rice. 

The dumplings were great! They had a super homemade feeling and that's probably cause they probably do their own dumplings in the back. The skewers were pretty good but they definitely were not a highlight. I'd probably say skip it unless you're really feeling pork skewers. The spicy Tofu was good and pretty spicy. I guess it had too much of a kick for me but I'm a little sensitive to spicy food. The Xiao long bao were good too. The only downside was that I expected more soup in it. 

All in all, I enjoyed my visit here! The service was great and the food was great too. Definitely worth a recommend."}
{"text":"Supergood dumplings! In the old Mother's location, but they've bettered it! Great selection of steamed, boiled and fried - classics like pork and chive, and novel ones [to me anyway] like pork and fennel, or egg/shrimp. Very tasty cold potato \"salad\" with sesame; and marinated cucumber. Very mom and pop, and very good. Cheap as anything too. Cash only!"}
{"text":"Yes.

Please don't tell anyone about this place.  Way more than we could eat but we ate almost all if it and $25 for two people.

Liked the sea weed salad and also the tofu salad.

Nice flavors.

Very nice owner (they had a restaurant in Queens NY before opening here).

Please, keep this place a secrete."}
{"text":"Disappointing, after reading the great reviews. The fried glass noodles had good flavour but it was swimming in oil and we really couldn't bring ourselves to have more after the first few bites when it was piping got. Fried dumplings were crispy with hints of burnt edges. The filling was really lovely but the burnt bits overwhelmed the flavours. The beef pancake rolls were nothing to write home about. The ratio of filling to pancake was a bit low. 

I maybe would come back to try the steamed dumplings, but was not impressed by what I ordered this time."}
{"text":"pork and Chive dumpling s were okay nothing special BUT staff was super nice and the environment was friendly !"}
{"text":"Whole table got sick after eating here.  We don't have weak stomachs or anything and quite often visit  sketchy places like this.

Avoid.

Food might be good to somebody who usually orders egg rolls and such, but not to people looking for authentic eats."}
{"text":"I come here often! It is my go to dumpling place. Always amazing. They make everything in a open concept kitchen as it is ordered so everything comes out super fresh and delicious. Definitely would suggest giving then a try :)"}
{"text":"I came here the other night with a large group after failing to escape at the escape room next door. Wasn't sure what to order and didn't want too much. The server suggested the pork & bean bun, so I tried that. I was glad to find out they were similar to dumplings. The outer flour portion is thicker than dumplings, which made them more filling. I shared one order of them (there were 4) with my husband. It was a nice little meal snack. And the price is right."}
{"text":"Good dumpling.  Bought frozen dumpling here a few time.  The price is reasonable and the filling is well seasoned with right ratio of meat/vegetable.  The dumpling tastes better than another dumpling place near my house.  This little family owned joint is nested at the corner of Dundas/Huron.  It can be easily missed since it's located in a basement and the store front is not very visible to the patrons.  However, it may not look the part but the flavour certainly make up for it.  Onion pan cake is just average as it doesn't have enough spring onion that I desire.  Noodle item tastes ok, not bad but not particularly good.  But it is a dumpling place and it certainly does well on its main products.  Service is friendly overall as it is family owned.  3.5/5 for overall experience."}
{"text":"Great out of the way place. Chicken and pork dumplings were excellent. You can tell they are made fresh. Beef pancakes were very good but not everyone's favorite (we are a family of 5). Our favorite was the chive soft pancake. Really tasty and crisp! My 11 year old who is not a big Chinese food fan really enjoyed the braised beef appetizer. He ate the whole serving pretty much by himself. I would avoid the sesame noodles. Noodles were cooked well but the sesame sauce was a little pasty tasting. Not horrible though. Great clean and affordable dining."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday lunch, using the Groupon deal (their menu shortchanges you 1 dish, but oh well)  - only 2 other tables occupied at the time. Apparently somebody didn't show up for work, but we didn't think it would be too bad. Big mistake. 

The 2 hot & sour soups and beef shank app came out, all tasted good, but the owner (man) pretended he didn't speak any english and claims we didn't order the tomato/egg soup - which was clearly written on the little paper that we gave him. Then you hear him speak on  the phone IN ENGLISH, but he continues with his little act throughout the lunch service. Actually there was no \"service\" to speak of, so that's not the right word to use. Another note, thank goodness we wrote down what we ordered or we would have missed 3 dishes, had we not gone back into the kitchen (because that's where everyone was, certainly not in the front of the restaurant) and asked for our dishes ourselves.

At any rate, we ordered beef pancake, shrimp & chive, pork & cabbage steamed dumplings, xiao long bo, and chicken & mushroom panfried dumplings. Everything was just ok, as another reviewer mentions, but it took TWO hours. I don't care if it's made by hand, there was absolutely no reason for the meal to take this long, and if I have to go into the kitchen to ask where my food is, get my own tea refills, etc... it's not worth it. I've been to so many chinese restaurants around the GTA and I don't expect amazing service, but this has been by far the worst restaurant experience ever. And I don't say that lightly.  I think it had more to do with the owner pretending he didn't understand us when it suited him, but he was just fine asking for money from everyone on their way out. Unbelievable.

I will never go back and will tell people to avoid this place. You have been warned."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery from this place, food are cheap which is a plus, but taste are bad. The ingredients of the side dishes are fresh but super oily. Me and my husband both felt disappointed about the food."}
{"text":"The name of the restaurant tells the truth. We were visiting from out of town and wanted some authentic, interesting chinese that the kids would still eat. The kids are big dumpling fans, so we thought this would be the ticket. We ordered way too much food - chive pancakes, sesame noodles, wonton soup, panfried pork and chive dumplings, steamed egg, chive and cucumber dumplings (for the vegetarian), and the woman serving suggested we try the juice buns as well. Everything was delicious and freshly prepared. A little bit of difficulty communicating - but very much made up for by the great friendliness of the service. Highly recommend this place - not much in the way of atmosphere, but excellent food, lovely service, and an all around good experience."}
{"text":"Got take out from the restaurant on a Sunday around 3 in the afternoon. The restaurant wasn't busy, but the food still took a good 50 mins. I was still okay with that since I figured the food would taste better on account of it being freshly prepared. Took it home and was pretty disappointed... I ordered their \"xiao long bao\", pan fried pork and chive dumplings and beef stuffed pancakes. Xiao long bao was more of a pork bun, and didn't have the thin skin and juicy filling that you would expect, and all three dishes had very little filling, and lots of dough. Not impressed!"}
{"text":"No question the best dumpling spot in downtown Chinatown. This place is on par with a typical neighbourhood dumpling joint in Beijing (though the family that runs this place is from Qingdao). 

Don't skip the cold dishes - they are authentic & delicious. The tofu bamboo with celery and the smacked cucumber salad are particularly good. 

Do get the green onion pancakes - crispy, fried, green onion infused flatbread. No one I've ever seen try green onion pancakes has failed to love them. 

Dumpling-wise: good dumpling skins - not too thin, not too thick and fresh-tasting. Fillings are reasonably fresh and nicely seasoned.The mutton and carrot are a favourite of mine, but the chicken and mushroom are great too. You can get them boiled or fried. 

Another handy thing about this place is that you can get frozen dumplings to go - I always buy tons and it's become my go-to quick meal at home. 

Decor is simple, but cozy and clean. A great spot for a casual Chinese meal. Go here rather than wasting your cash at Mother's or Dumpling House!"}
{"text":"I don't understand how this place isn't permanently packed.  For my money, it's the best dumpling place in Chinatown.  You can tell their dumplings are made by hand in small quantities, using only fresh ingredients.  Honestly, I don't think I've every tasted dumplings in a restaurant that were so close to the ones that the mother of a friend of mine from Northern China makes.

I've been bringing guests from out of town to this place for years and absolutely everyone loves it -- including a discerning friend from San Francisco who insisted on going again the next time she visited.  Not to be missed."}
{"text":"Don't have anything bad to say about this place. Very authentic dumpling house with generous portions. The skin is quite thin compared to other places and you can tell it's freshly made. Decor is really terrible but then again the food more than compensates for that. Just found our next go-to dumpling spot downtown."}
{"text":"Been to Yummy Yummy Dumplings today for the first time.

The service was nice and fast. However, the food was not that Yummy. The beef roll was hot on the outside and cold on the inside. We also had a soup that I really didn't care for...may be because of my personal taste. However, one would expect the dumplings to be good, but they were disappointing. Chicken or pork it doesn't matter...tastes the same.

At least it was cheap."}
{"text":"This place is much better than Mother's Dumplings! The lady is so nice and the prices are really decent! Service usually great too!"}
{"text":"The dumplings were good and cheap but not amazing. Also it took them awhile to make them, but that might because they do them by hand. 

The pan fried dumplings didn't have that crispy skin like the other places I've been too, so that was a bit disappointing. Not much comment on service, I did take out, but I did have to ask for chopsticks but they gave all the sauces without asking."}
{"text":"Mutton dumplings-my flavor of choice each time we visit. 
Chinese potato salad--I've got to try this at home!

I think a few things have been removed from the menu since we were here last.
But quality and flavor remains tried and true.

Gawd, I still can't believe that freshly made dumplings are this cheap and easy to get!"}
{"text":"Needed a quick bite to eat for dinner.  Ordered 6 xiaolongbao baozi in two different varieties.  Hand made fresh and reminded me of my time in China.  What's not to like?"}
{"text":"My favourite dumpling place in Toronto! (try their steamed cucumber/egg/tofu dumplings, and chive pockets if you dig chives)

I know it sounds silly but I was actually a little upset to read some of the negative reviews. The restaurant is owned and run by a pleasant, down-to-earth couple in their 50's/60's. They are obviously not tech-savy so I wouldn't be surprised if they actually did run into technical difficulties (although I guess they should've offered some sort of compensation). Plus there is some language/etiquette barrier which can result in misunderstanding.

I've been to the place 10+ times with different groups of people, no one's ever had any stomach problems. But I guess as with any restaurant, there are bound to be some negative reviews...

This restaurant is definitely not your typical Chinatown restaurant. The home-made food is not nearly as greasy and heavily spiced/seasoned, so I've noticed my friends who like spicy greasy food (only) did not enjoy the meal as much as others.

Overall, I've enjoyed nothing but great service and yummy food at this affordable restaurant!
=D"}
{"text":"My husband and I missed out on this restaurant the last time we were in town since they were not opened yet as we left the city.  This time, we were lucky to stumble across this place and have a chance to eat at this dumpling house.  Def. a mom and pop's shop where the extensive menu has you a bit confused but more due to the fact that every flavor sounds good.  We thought we'd be adventurous and try the mutton with carrots dumplings.  We also made a mistake of ordering Xiao long bao which ended up really being a bun vs. the soup dumpling we thought it might've been.  But we were very impressed with the freshness of our boiled dumplings which were made to order by who appeared to be the owner's wife.  They were very moist on the inside as well so we were not disappointed that we did not have the soup in our Xiao long bao.  Overall, great food, very quiet on a Friday afternoon but wonderful to have the space and the restaurant to ourselves.  Will def. come again!"}
{"text":"Food was great and authentic, just like my last trip to China.  Place is a bit small and run-down.  Owner/staff was super friendly, forgetful but friendly.  Food came at a timely fashion and piping hot.  Just the right amount of grease to not scare away the health conscience freaks, I mean people.  I didn't have diarrhea when I got home, which is always a good sign of clean food...unlike some Thai place *cough* Pai Northern Thai *cough*"}
{"text":"I loooooove dumplings. Little delicious meat morsels surrounded by dough? Yes please. So I figured it was time to start exploring some of the dumpling places around Toronto. (I swear, my mouth is watering thinking about dumplings...)

This place is just a street over from Spadina. When we went it was at night a bit past the usual dinner hour, and no one else was there (though a couple of people came in after us). If you're looking for a visually appeasing place to eat, this is not it. I might have seen a piece of food underneath our table, dropped by some previous customer. But I didn't come here to be wowed by fancy chopsticks or wall art. I came here for one thing, and one thing only: dumplings. 

Pre-dumpling, we did try a couple of other things. The shredded potato salad from Anita's review sounded interesting, and it was quite yummy!  First time I've had it - a bit vinegary, refreshingly crisp. I'd definitely order again, especially since it was only $1.99. We also ordered a tofu dish (I think it was braised?) SO GOOD. And $3.99 for a large plate. It was greasy but I could not stop eating it. 

On to the dumplings. They had boiled, steamed, and fried dumplings on the menu (many were repeated on the menu in the three sections). We tried the steamed mutton and carrot dumplings... and they tasted like mutton. A bit too strong for me. I can't fault them for that, so my bad for ordering it. The pan fried chicken, mushroom and cabbage dumplings were excellent. 

This place is a mom and pop shop. Peeking through the curtain, you can see what looks like just regular appliances. No fancy restaurant appliances there. Not needed. The place was WELL heated. We were sitting close to the door on a chilly night, and the heat was comfortably blaring. 

I will definitely be back to try some more out!"}
{"text":"Uh, how does this place have 4.5 stars? 

Yes, it's a hole in the wall mom-and-pop place (literally, husband and wife cooking and waiting) and yes, the food is cheap. But my friend and I were scratching our heads after the meal. How do you mess up hot and sour soup and Zhajiangmian? These are two fail safe dishes you should be able to order anywhere but somehow they managed to mess them up, and let me tell you how: the hot and sour soup was actually oily. It tasted strongly of sesame oil and olives.  The zhajiangmian was the same, lacking in the typical soybean paste sauce and instead consisting of olive flavored pickles and ground meat. There was barely enough meat to flavor all the noodles.   We deduced that the brine they used for their homemade pickles was much like olive brine which made those dishes taste off. 

We also ordered beef with with spring onion pancake wrap. This one tasted ok because of the heavy dose of hoisin sauce, but it was a little short on the beef and the pancake was a bit too doughy. 

The only redeeming quality of this place was the home made dumplings. They were made with handmade wrapping and ended up decent but the filling tasted a bit heavy.. perhaps it had a little too much soy sauce and something about the meat to veggie ratio was off. I've had way better in LA or SF."}
{"text":"Walked down from AOG. Super friendly service and great food. Lived up to the name yummy yummy! Cash and debit only."}
{"text":"Every time I passed by this place I always wanted to get in and have some dumplings. 
And today after walking in the chilling wind for an hour, I decided to come and sit down.

Staff:
The lady staff, I think she's the owner, is so very friendly. I went alone but she welcomed me to sit at a table for four because I was with my big backpack and thick jacket. When the restaurant was getting busy, I suggested I could move to a table for two. The auntie moved me to another table for four and kept saying sorry about that. And she came and checked if the food was okay a short while after my soup was served. She also gave suggestion for food in a really 
warm and motherly way.

Food:
They are not westernised Chinese food!! I love the sour spicy soup and the pork vegetable dumpling. And the dry tofu salad was good but I was really too full after eating the soup and dumpling. 

Environment:
Not too noisy, adequate space, clean.

All in all:
Will be back WITH FRIENDS. I wanted to try too many dishes and this is genuinely a good place for Chinese food."}
{"text":"I live in an odd part of Downtown where I'm super centralized yet somehow always outside the delivery zone for many good restaurants.

Yummy yummy dumplings delivers to me and it's always soooooo good. The dumplings are juicy and flavorful. I find a lot of dumpling spots use fatty meats (which make the dumplings very juicy but oily) yummy yummy's is meaty AND juicy.  Plus I love the variety of fillings available!"}
{"text":"In my opinion, this is a hidden gem in Chinatown.

Food: some restaurants make food that's too salty or too sweet, to try to make it taste good.  Here, the food is just right.  Not too salty.  It reminds me of good home cooking, like something my Mom or my partner would make.  Once, we had the noodle here, and the waitress said she made the noodle herself (I think she meant she made the noodle from flour etc. herself).  It was good.  I like the beef roll pancake here.  We always order the seaweed salad, which might not be to everyone's taste, but we like it.

Setting: it's quiet, a restaurant where my partner and I go, relax, and enjoy some down time.

Price: not expensive. Including tax and tip, it's about ~$37 for two of us each time for lunch.  We usually order 3-4 dishes and have some leftovers to take home.

Verdict: we first came here with a Groupon years ago, we've been back multiple times, and this is one of our go-to restaurants in Chinatown."}
{"text":"Great dongbei food and handmade dumplings. Tons of filling options, including vegetarian and seafood ones.  My faves are shrimp and chive!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem tucked in the side streets of Chinatown. The place is small but cozy. There was a older man and a lady who serves you -- the lady doesn't speak much English but she's still very kind and understands enough to grasp your order. She always has the best smile and is happy to help. The man is just as kind. 

The dumplings are delicious in every style; whether you want steamed, boiled or pan fried. They also have some stuffed pancakes which are similar to a pan fried dumpling but more circular and larger.

However, my absolutely favourite and probably the best in Toronto I've ever had is their juicy pork bun. It's actually the xiao long bao or aka soup dumpling. (I added a tip, but basically if you order \"xiao long bao\" you get a miniature pork bun that you don't expect). The soup has some nice flavour to it and you definitely can identify the broth. This is a must order item.

For such a delicious selection and welcoming environment, it's strangely empty and quiet. They definitely deserve more recognition. By far my favourite dumpling place in the city."}
{"text":"The very definition of a mom an pop place as you can actually see the mom and dad making the dumplings in the kitchen!  It's a quiet spot with the decor typical of an old school Chinese restaurant.  

The dumplings are great here, probably my new favourite dumpling spot in the area.  We had the boiled, steamed and pan fried dumpings all of different varieties that I can't remember anymore, but all were great.  The dumplings in a soup found at the back of the menu are a recommended try.  They are basically just dumplings overfilled with flavourable juices with the meat inside.  When you bite into it, it's a literal explosion of yumminess in your mouth.         

The wait to get the food is a bit slow, but it's only because they make the food to order.  You can really taste the freshness of the ingredients and I think it's worth the wait as the dumplings are tasty and juicy."}
{"text":"Ordered their chive filled pocket. Basically it's a doughy pizza like pocket filled with, you guessed it, chives along with some egg and glass noodles. It's then pan fried on the outside to a nice golden brown. When you bite into it, the outside is crispy and soft, chewy on the inside. The filling is nicely seasoned and of course I always add hot chili oil which makes it even more yummy to my tummy"}
{"text":"No bullshit dumplings. One of the best dumpling spot in Toronto. The lady working was friendly. The only downside is that its kinda tucked away in Huron instead of on Dundas."}
{"text":"The dumpling was flavorful and there were some unique ones. The black fish dumpling actually had very meaty (like pork) taste. That was a surprise, a pleasant surprise for sure. The beef rolls were nicely done and personally a little more green onion would hit it out of the park. The veggie dumpling is flavorful too, but I definitely want to try more traditional ones next time. This means that I will definitely be back.

I know the location is not great and the store front might give you pause. But it is truly a nice Chinese place with good prices."}
{"text":"I've been here twice in total and it has been awhile since my first visit and I was craving some dumplings so I decided to come here again since my last experience was great! I'm actually surprised I didn't even write a review last time. Unfortunately I would have updated it from a 4 star to a 3.5 star (if there was a .5).

I'm not sure if chefs have changed but the food didn't taste as good as it did last I was here. The Zha Jiang Mian I ordered was very light in taste when I was looking for a bit stronger flavor from the sauce. It LOOKED good but taste did not follow. The Jellyfish and Cucumber got extra oilier and had too soury of a taste but at least they were crunchy/chewy like they should be. The only thing that was ok were the dumplings. Not much else to say about the food...

Service was good and remained unchanged last I was here.

Soooo long story short, I may come back to give this place another chance otherwise I'd just look elsewhere. Not a bad place but I've tasted better."}
{"text":"Came here Saturday night 

Pros
- Excellent service 
- Family Style ambiance 
- professional 

Cons
- it may be because I'm not much of a dumpling guy but they were average in my opinion"}
{"text":"Great authentic food, large servings, friendly staff. This is the type of place you bring your Chinese relatives to impress them with the food. Bring cash. The location and  decor will not wow you, but the food sure will."}
{"text":"We found this place on yelp, and decided to try it out Saturday for lunch.  The service was good, and the food was great.

We also ordered the Xiao long bao, and was told the 2nd one in that group was the soup dumpling we are used to.  (Joe Shanghi, Ding Tai Gong- Taiwan).  Anyway, we tried both and she was correct.  Their Xiao long bao was a pork dumpling - still good. Just an fyi."}
{"text":"Rare find in Toronto, authentic northeastern Chinese dishes freshly made, free wifi, two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"3/5 - inability to deliver

So - is the food still good? Yup. But - their delivery service is mind boggling bad. A few times I added a soda (or two) to the order, and they never included it. The third time when getting delivery I asked if the soda was there. The man simply said \"oops\" and gave me a dollar back as if doing me a favor.

The latest was absurd - with an estimated arrival time one hour after the order, I called 40 minuets after (100 minutes after order). After simply stating \"I ordered and have not...\" (and before I could finish my sentence), the man quickly answered \"it will be there in six minutes.\" After questioning how he could know it was 1) exactly 6 minutes and 2) not even know who I was, I was informed that there was only one driver and he was definitely just six minutes away.

Of course the ordered actually arrived another 20 minutes later - 2 hours after ordering, an hour late.

Sigh."}
{"text":"had a great meal here. food came very slow but great xiao long bao.

be sure to try cucumber salad. a bite between dumplings will give refreshing taste."}
{"text":"Dumplings here were pretty good. Not the best I've had, but we preferred them to the more popular dumpling house on Spadina (felt that these ones had more meat). 

There were a few others eating when we were there (Sunday night), but still it seemed a lot quieter than the Chinese places on Spadina. No wait for a table though which is always good. 

The reason that I'll be back is the pancakes. Taste great (not as good as the ones I am used to in LA, but still very good). My other standard order (lamb dumplings) didn't have the strong lamb taste that I love (I think because they mixed in carrots), but still pretty decent.

So if I had to compare these to LA dumplings, I may give this place 3 star. But they are the best I've had in Toronto. 

Cash only"}
{"text":"Yummy dumplings has very reasonable prices and lovely staff.  Unfortunately the dumplings and buns didn't live up to the name for me. We tried several variations and only the xiao long bao inspired me - admittedly they were great but the rest were bland or had a really doughy taste.

Which is a shame because the service was so lovely and the prices so cheap. In my opinion there are much better options in China town which are probably just as well priced."}
{"text":"After having gone to the higher regarded dumpling houses in Chinatown, my wife and I happened upon this place and were incredibly glad we did.  Despite its humble location, this place had some of the better dumplings we had in town.  I was particularly a fan of the pan fried dumplings and buns.  The dumplings were not as pretty as some of the competitors dumplings I have tried in town, but they were just as good and incredibly reasonable in price.  If you are in Toronto looking for some good dumpling and do not want to have to wait in line forever to get them, I highly recommend this joint."}
{"text":"Staff nice, food universally weird and we feel gross after. Also very expensive - small soup, $1.50 congee yet the bill was $35!! Not sure how this place has earned such high reviews - Yelp has led us astray tonight."}
{"text":"Okay, so I was really craving dumplings one day and yelp helped me find this little hole in the wall. Literally. It's beside the sketchiest alleyway ever, and tbh I wouldn't have gone near this place if it weren't for the fact that I was with friends. Don't be alarmed, though! It actually serves pretty good dumplings! I believe the store is owned by a couple--the wife btw is the sweetest lady you'll meet. She doesn't speak English very well, so it might take a few tries to communicate, but she always had a big smile on when serving us.

Review of menu items:

D02 juicy pork dumplings
You would think that D01 xiao long bao is the soup dumpling you are looking for but it's not! It's actually D02. So, they're not as beautiful as I would expect them to be but heck, they were delicious. 

E04 pork and chive dumplings, pan fried
I gotta say that pan fried dumplings are my fave kind to eat! You don't really taste the chive but I guarantee that you'll notice there's no chive if it's pork only. Very flavourful filling.

E06 pork shrimp and cabbage dumplings, steamed
I really enjoyed this one too! Although I'm not a fan of cabbage, the pork and shrimp made up for it. It would've been nice if there was a chive option instead of cabbage.

E12 pork and pickled cabbage dumplings, boiled
It was quite interesting. I liked the filling (if you are a fan of pickled veggies, you too will like it), but I think I would rather have it steamed or pan fried.

F20 rolled beef pancake
Not a dumpling but more of a roll filled with pork and other veggies. Quite good!

Individually, I immensely enjoyed all of them. Only downside was that the fillings are seasoned the exact same way no matter the type of dumpling (except for the pickled cabbage). And of course, I got sick of the flavour after a while. I would deff stop by here again, but maybe only have one or two of the menu items. :)"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Yummy Yummy Dumplings. For the last 3 years, I've been ordering whenever I find myself short for time to make dinner or I've needed a late night \"snack\". Really nice staff too. Thank you for your amazing pork and chive steamed dumplings! Great hidden chinatown gem"}
{"text":"I was delightfully surprised with this place. We came in for some better dumplings after being disappointed with Mother's Dumplings and leaving before we were full. These here were obviously handmade (we could see them doing it in the window!) and very delicious. 

The pan fried chicken dumplings were our favourite, followed by the pork and pickled cabbage. Service was very good and it was nice and clean. 

It wasn't as good as what you'd find in Markham, but very good for downtown."}
{"text":"ive been wanting to try homemade authentic dumplings and im so glad i found this place!! its small and a bit hidden and not very busy most of the time. the owners dont seem to speak much english but they have a good system of having customers write down their order number. they were very humble and even sat down to eat their lunch. the dumplings were AMAZING. made fresh to order, they were full of flavour and a slight crisp of the pan frying technique. they were a bit oily but i wasnt expecting this dish to be healthy. they also have vinegar on every table, if you remember anything about my review EAT THE DUMPLINGS WITH THE VINEGAR. im drooling just thinking about it. also the prices are so good. 10 dumplings for $8 and i was perfectly satisfied. i highly recommend if you're in the mood for some homemade dumplings!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good but serving size is small. I guess that's why the price is so cheap.  Staff was friendly enough though."}
{"text":"I called for delivery and what I ordered is not what they delicered. Pretty disappointing. The skin on the dumplings were too thick and the hot and sour soup was bland. I would not come back."}
{"text":"Really great restaurant!!! Authentic northern Chinese cuisine and really nice staff. I'm Chinese and I loved loved loved this restaurant! Try the pan fried buns, dumplings, ja jiang mian or whatever suits your fancy. Many vegetarian options too. Hidden gem! Opens at noon on Sundays. They also deliver if you order more than $30."}
{"text":"Another good dining experience at yummy yummy dumplings. 

Ordered the panfried squid and chive dumplings, steamed pork shrimp and chive, and the xiao long bao. Also got beef noodles and the first noodle in the noodle section (can't remember what it was called) but it was noodle in sauce and not soup. Aaand we got the beef shank as well.

The dumplings were good as expected. The beef shank was not super tender, but was still enjoyable esp when dipped in the raw garlic sauce that comes with it. The noodles both had a nice chewy texture. I liked the flavour of the sauce one. The beef in the beef noodle was quite tough and hard to chew. The xiao long bao was not quite the kind I'm used to...I was imagining thin outside and soup filled. It was thick bao and not soup filled. Still yummy - just not the xiao long bao I'm used to!"}
{"text":"The dumpling was freshly made! All hand made. Nicely done.

Tastes perfect! Definately very well made dumplings! 

Very affordable! But the Green Onion cake wasn't ask good as I had expected, but if you want traditional homemade dumplings, this is the restaurant to go to!"}
{"text":"This place is a little hidden and slightly off Dundas but it is really good. Everything is made fresh to order and the prices are really reasonable. The owners are really nice and make you feel welcome. I've been twice already to this place and will definitely be back in the future!"}
{"text":"To all the mistresses on Yelp: everyone says he'll never ditch his wife for you, and that's almost definitely true. But if you wait long enough for their relationship to wither on its own, well...! That's what happened here, except I'm the cheater and Yummy Yummy Dumplings is Camilla Parker Bowles.

The dumplings here are even fresher than I remembered (you can watch the friendly dumplingiolos make them on the spot and deliver them to you piping hot) and they are the PERFECT size and temperature. Lots of filling, a little soupy inside, the right amount of skin. There are tons of veggie options besides the common \"egg and chive\".

YYD, you are my new favourite Chinatown eatery and I look forward to our long, fruitful, and mostly faithful marriage."}
{"text":"***1/2 stars

I discovered Yummy Yummy Dumpling from Groupon as they had a deal going.  The restaurant is located underground in the old Mother's location.  I've tried my fair share of dumpling restaurants (Mother's being one) and I must say that Yummy Yummy might just be the best of the lot.

They serve up their dumplings 3 ways (boiled, fried or steamed).  Boiled is definitely not the way to go as a lot of flavour is lost in the boiling process; if you want to be healthy then go for the steamed; but fried is definitely the way to go for texture and flavour!  

There are also a variety of cold and hot dishes, though I think I'll pass on these next time as the Sour & Spicy Seaweed was mediocre at best and I'm really not a fan of the thicker type of seaweed they use.  

The Fried Curd Noodles is served with thin strips of cucumber on a bed of udon noodles.  The fried curd sauce was salty, and didn't have much distinct flavour other than that.  

The winning dish for me were the Beef \"Pancakes\" which are basically flattened out, dumplings in the shape of a round disc.  The beef had chives in it, and was tender, moist, and extremely flavourful.  I think they flavour it with Chinese five-spice and I would definitely recommend it.

We got the Fried Pork, Chive and Shrimp Dumplings.  I found it peculiar that these dumplings were only sealed at the top but exposed at the sides.  It was not a plate of grease, and the dumpling wrappers are house made with the right ratio of thickness to them.  

V E R D I C T:

For $23, we were stuffed.  This is a very mom and pop-style restaurant with very simple but functional decor.  It is clean, and service was great.  I'd come here any day over some of the other options on the busier streets of Spadina."}
{"text":"DONT ever do take out, the dumplings are so hot it melts the styrofoam.  If you want to get cancer then i guess it's fine.  But seriously, they should change their take out containers!"}
{"text":"Cheap, delicious and the staff are super friendly. 
Great bang for your buck. Bring friends, order a bunch and share."}
{"text":"I had really high hopes for Yummy Yummy Dumplings but it is just okay. The restaurant is a little dark and dingy - cleanliness can be questionable. The lady server spoke Mandarin and minimal English, but enough to be able to communicate your order. She is very friendly and was sure to check up on us often with a smile. We ordered the pan fried shrimp pork and chive dumplings, juicy pork buns, and zha jiang noodles with minced meat.

- Pan fried shrimp, pork, and chive dumplings: I think these are made to order because I saw a gentleman making dumplings in the kitchen and then heard from frying shortly after. These are pretty good, but certainly not the best I've had. They are good alone or with hot chili oil. 
- Juicy pork buns: I'm not quite sure what the difference is between this and xiao long bao which is listed separately on the menu because it looks the same. Each order comes with 6 of these little nuggets. You eat it the same as you would a XLB where you bite off the top of the skin and slurp up the soup, then devour the rest. Tasted fresh. 
- Zha jiang noodles: It costs an extra $1 if you choose to have meat. You can also decide whether you want this dish to be cold or hot. We opted for the hot. Refreshing and light, it certainly did not make me feel fat as I was eating it. I did expected it to have more flavor so that was a little disappointing. I liked it more when I mixed in some hot chili oil. Good portion size. 

Overall, I thought the food here was somewhat on the more bland side however I guess it's cool because it made me feel healthy I suppose. While this place is not expensive, it is definitely not dirt cheap which is surprising since it looks so ghetto in there. I noticed that many of the customers were non-Chinese foreigners which may or may not mean anything - probably stumbled in due to Yelp reviews like myself."}
{"text":"The chicken had a funky taste. The fried dumplings were good. It's off to a corner of the street, kind of hard to tell.

The service was good, nothing really to complaint."}
{"text":"When in Chinatown, I had to eat something Chinese. I ordered the juicy pork buns, which are the ones with soup. They're not the best I've had, but they were good. I preferred the shrimp, pork, and chive dumplings (pan fried) I also ordered. The sides weren't pinched closed though, so every time I took a bite the filling will fall out. The dumplings took a while to come out, but service was good overall. The hostess/waitress was friendly."}
{"text":"Super tasty dumplings! They are all fresh and made in house...my kids adore this place. Flavours and textures are unexpected such as the juicy pork bun. The pot stickers are crunchy on the outside and moist inside. Atmosphere is what it is- a basement room lit up with bright lights on aging formica tables. That said, this place does a brisk business for a reason- satisfies your dumpling cravings. Family friendly service."}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday evening and the place was almost completely empty. Surprising because the dumplings I had here were some of the best that I've had in Toronto. The juicy pork buns are a MUST TRY. I also got the pork, shrimp, and chive dumplings and the beef pancake wrap which both tasted quite good. 

The owners here are incredibly friendly and genuinely seemed to care about our experience.

My only complaint is that I wish they took credit, but it's Chinatown so I really shouldn't expect otherwise. Overall, if I had a dumpling craving I'd choose to come back here instead of the many other dumpling spots in Chinatown."}
{"text":"For people who care too much about service, please walk away. This is not the place for you. Just don't give them a 2 stars when you decided to walk into a shabby basement. For people who really know how to appreciate North Chinese food, this is the best dumplings you will get in town, period. --a Beijinger."}
{"text":"This hole in a wall deserves a 5star! Small little place, not very well decorated.. but who cares! They serve the best soup dumplings in Toronto."}
{"text":"Just had delivery in my hotel downtown - correct order arrived at my room in 40 minutes. Beats room service! We ordered the cold cucumber salad and three orders of dumplings: boiled pork cabbage and parsley (cilantro), steamed pork and chives and steamed egg, cabbage and mushroom. Everything was delicious. The filling to wrapper ratio was great. Filling were seasoned perfectly. Definitely the way to go if you rather veg in your room after a long day working or trekking around town. Cash only."}
{"text":"My partner in crime and I have been ardently loyal Dumpling King fans for the past two years, though we've noticed a slight but noticeable drop in quality, both concerning service and the dumplings themselves (the TV is always tuned to OMNI1, often on a Bollywood or Melissa DiMarco interview, with full control given to the sometimes smile-free staff; and the dumpling wrappers have gotten quite thick and floury - I'm still trying to find a correlation between the two). 

Today, following a Tuina massage, we turned the corner and popped into family-run Yummy Yummy. We left fully converted! Here are some noticeable differences:

1) The food is delivered incredibly fast (may depend on how busy they are) and at precisely a temperature that you can confidently pop a full dumpling in your mouth and let the flavour burst outward. Frankly, it is a wonderful experience that Maynard's Fruit Gushers only wishes they could replicate.

2) Speaking of flavour, the dumplings were phenomenal in this respect - we had the Shrimp & Chive, the Squid & Chive (both boiled), and the Melon & Tofu (steamed). Each was distinct and tasty. The squid was in no way too chewy, there was copious shrimp, and the chives were not overwhelmingly stringy - overall, these dumplings were scrumptious. We preferred the boiled for taking single bites (the internal soup makes the explosion extra-invigorating) while the steamed is better for taking in multiple bites. Use this information as you please! 

In the past, we have also ordered the pan fried chive pockets, which were tasty. Obviously these are a little more filling and fried than the dumplings, so if you're looking for something more doughy, these are a good bet.

3) The prices are comparable to the other neighbourhood dumpling joints. However, you can leave with a couple bags of frozen dumplings if you want to try and recreate the Yummy Yummy experience at home. They vary around 33 to 50 cents per dumpling.

4) The last time we were here, the TV was also tuned to OMNI - I suppose it is the Chinatown dumpling-channel of choice. Today the TV was off entirely, which I think is a step in the right direction."}
{"text":"Tucked away into the basement, this place is easy to walk by ( which I did). 
Ordered pork and chive steamed dumplings and their classic buns for take out. 
Sat there for a really long time waiting ( almost thirty minutes) and I was actually the only person in the restaurant! They had calls constantly for delivery so I assuming those pushed ahead of my order. 
Pretty standard dumplings, nothing to write home about. Price is good, will try dining in next time and see if that makes a difference."}
{"text":"Frankly if it wasn't for yelp reviews I would have never thought to step into this restaurant. From outside it looks like a tiny hole in the wall and inside there are 5 or 6 table only. 
However, the food was fresh and delicious, very authentic and very very reasonably priced. 
I'm definitely coming back again to sample more food."}
{"text":"not the greatest.

only came here because it's \"dumpling day\" tradition, and dumpling house on spadina closed (since it was tuesday). not impressed about the quality and the service."}
{"text":"This is certainly a hidden GEM.  It is not often that I randomly stumble (with some help from Yelp) into a restaurant and find myself so dazzled by the quality and authenticity of food that I order above my initially intended order. This is NOT just a dumpling house. The entrees on their menu are fairly priced, nicely sized, fresh, delicious, and authentic.  Delivery is available for orders over $30. They use NO MSG.  Best of all: the owner is just fantastic. Such a sweet woman. My first trip to this restaurant and upon ordering the sliced beef shank, she gave us an order of scallion pancake to accompany it.  Wow. All I can say is wow."}
{"text":"I've had my share of Yummy Yummy Dumplings in my day, especially when I used to live in California, I was a pretty wild child, and that's not even including dumplings in a food sense. If you think dumplings are something that gets served with Roast Beef and Gravy, then leave the Midwest for a week or so, and fly up to Toronto and get schooled.

What to get: Pan Fried Dumplings
What else: While these are amazing, you *must* try the ones at Dumpling House too

So I make notes after I eat somewhere, which I later use in a review where I add all the flowery language and bad jokes and flowery language and repetition and flowery language. And my notes for YYD say:

Incredible dumplings, wonderful service from girl, really delicious pan fried pork dumplings with hot oil, yum, cheap, friendly, bathroom, not busy.

I'm not sure what \"bathroom\" means. That they have a bathroom? That the bathroom is nice? That it is awful? That it is notable in some way? Welcome to the wonderful world of making notes that you don't actually understand months later.

What I do know is that the girl really was one of the best servers I've had in Canada. So friendly and helpful and lovely. I wanted to ask for her number, but the guy in the booth behind me was an ex and I didn't want any jealousy issues, so. I'm a dumpling lover, not a fighter.

The hot oil is a big deal. Add it to the dumplings for a little kick. Cheap is right. It's almost sad how cheap the dumplings are in Chinatown. But that just means you can order more right? How many dumplings can you fit in your mouth? Back in 'Frisco I could do 10 at a time. But that was before I discovered that dumplings were also a food item.

What else I do know is that when I'm in Toronto and I want dumplings, there are 2 places I go. Dumpling House for literally the best on the planet, unlike any other you'll ever have. And then here to the much quieter, much more friendly, unassuming YYD, for traditional style, wet, juicy, perfect Pork And Chive Dumplings. Of the two, I'd pick the other every time. But you kind of have to go to both. Not least because this place is often as quiet as .....

.....

....

As that. Whereas the other is often, wait for a table and then get thrown out the door as you suck the juice out of your last dumpling.

Oh, sucking juice out of dumplings. Those were the days.

But anyway back to food.

Come to Toronto. Visit Chinatown. Try the dumplings here, and at Dumpling House nearby on Spadina. Fried Pork And Chive, both times. Or the non-fried here are great too. Then try Pork Bone Soup from Keor Ak San. And don't forget to go all the way up to Kevin's Taiyaki for a custard fish shaped dessert. After those 4 stops, you'll have tried the very best that Asian Toronto has to offer. You can wash it all down with an exquisite Banh Mi from Banh Mi Boys.

Speaking of boys. Oh how I miss those California dumplings. Yummy Yummy in my tummy was actually my nickname in San Francisco in '77. Ah well. Times change."}
{"text":"A Chinatown gem, but definitely bring cash in CDN if you can. I'm sure they will accept dollars, but you'll have to pay the 1:1 conversion.

It's really tough to pay with a card. They have machines, but most debit cards even aren't accepted, especially if US based.

...The food, though!

I had the soupy dumplings - D02 -- definitely the winner on the menu and one of the only places I know in Toronto with delightful soup dumplings. Each bite is comfortable heaven in your mouth. The pork bun / wrap deserves a mention as well. I think it's F20 and it's freaking amazing. Like a crepe rolled with beef. The F03 stuffed fresh veggies are AOK, definitely fresh and tasty...but the standout was F20 and D02. 

I had the Zha Jiang noodles too and the noodles were delightful along with the pork sauce - although the pork sauce is served cold while the noodles are lukewarm and it makes for a strange combo, but still delicious. If I were coming here again though, I'd order the D02 (maybe 2 orders even) and the pork wrap, which I think is F20. So good.

Service can be awkward with a potential language barrier, but it works out and that's how you know the food is legit!"}
{"text":"I'm traveling in Toronto for a business trip and got lazy tonight and decided to place an order for delivery to my hotel. I hadn't had dumplings yet, so I went on a search for restaurants that serve dumplings AND deliver, and came across Yummy Yummy Dumplings. It had great reviews on Yelp to boot!

I ordered online - at first I tried to just order dumplings and noodles, and found that there was a $25 minimum for delivery orders, and I only had like $11 so far. This place is too cheap! So I went through the menu again, and this ended up being my order:

Shrimp, Chive, and Pork Dumplings (Potstickers)
Zha Jiang Noodles
Shredded Potato Salad Appetizer
Chive, Mushroom, and Vermicelli Steamed Dumplings
Green Onion Pancakes

ALL of the above came to a total of $25.46. Then a $3 delivery charge was added, $3.31 of tax, and $4.76 tip for a total of $36.53. It would be delivered in about 50 minutes.

Around 50 minutes later, I received a call asking to confirm my address, and then 10 minutes later I got a call from the hotel lobby asking if it was ok to send \"Yummy Yummy\" to my door. YES PLEASE!

The delivery guy showed up, and for some reason, his bill said $37.54...I didn't bother fighting it, and gave him $40, and got $2.40 back in change. Then I dug in! The potstickers and dumplings were AMAZING. Just like how my mom makes it...actually maybe even better (sorry mom). I was then pretty full, and still had 3 more dishes to go. The Zha Jiang Noodles was really not very good - too salty, and it just didn't have the right flavors that I'm used to back home in the Bay Area. I ate a few bites of the noodles with cucumbers, trying to avoid the sauce, and gave up. I wanted to go out and give it to a homeless person but I doubt anyone would want noodles...:\ The potato salad was great, had a spicy kick to it. And the green onion pancakes were good as well. 

Bottom Line:
I got a ton of food for a great price, delivered. The dumplings and appetizers are good, but stay away from the Zha Jiang Noodles."}
{"text":"Chive and pork pan fried dumplings
      -different way of wrapping dumpling than i have seen

Juicy pork buns

Probably won't be coming back but overall service was great"}
{"text":"A very fine lunch for very little money. Lovely plump dumplings--the fried esp good-- with interesting fillings, good chive pancake, OK hot and sour soup. The surroundings aren't grand but they are clean. And two can stuff themselves for under $25."}
{"text":"I ordered take out 10 steamed dumplings (shrimp, pork, and cabbage), but 5 of them has NO SHRIMP INSIDE!! RIDICULOUS!!!"}
{"text":"Yes.. Awesome steamed dumplings!! In search for Toronto's Xiao Long Baos - I stumbled upon Yummy in the downtown Chinatown... Apparently for actual XLBs there's another Chinatown but that was farther out and will have to wait for another trip. Anyway this place was very clean and had a variety of dumpling options..

We tried the fried chicken and cabbage dumplings and the steamed pork and chubs dumplings.... So they make all the dumplings in house you can watch throuj the glass... Interesting enough they have the option of boiled or steamed... Usually in Ny they seem to be one in the same and generally mean boiled but here steamed were cooked like the XLBs...

Both dumplings were really good small tho but they give u a good amount..."}
{"text":"Liked the pork and cabbage stuffed pancakes and pan fried pork dumplings. Cold shredded potatoes were lacking in flavour. Zhajiangmian was bland and came with little sauce."}
{"text":"This place is a small family runned business. Ordered the beef pancakes which were very juicy inside but nothing special. Same with the pork and chive potstickers.  They all had a funky smell/taste which threw me off. Don't think I'd go back but good for the people that seem to like it."}
{"text":"We were here with a large group on Saturday night, and were lucky enough to try a larger variety of dumplings.  The beef stuffed pancakes were delicious.  We also had a mixed variety of pan-fried dumplings (that had lamb, pork and something else).  The pork and dill dumplings was really dill-y, a bit too much for me, but the lamb steamed dumplings were great, and the pork and shrimp mixed ones were also good.  There was also a cucumber salad that was amazing.  I left full and happy.  Like really happy."}
{"text":"Yummy dumplings at really good prices. Dumplings were the saving grace. Believe me, I'm a huge dumpling devotee.

What to expect: a hole-in-the-wall place (like everyone says) that is no frills when it comes to the decor, in-restaurant entertainment, ok service and excellent food. 

DECOR:
I went here with my sister and a friend who has a phobia to non-Canadian food. We climbed down the stairs to the restaurant and were met with the basement-y scent of the restaurant. The upholstery on the banquets were peeling off, seating was limited and a sneak peek into the kitchen revealed the Whirlpool stove that I had at my old Kensington apartment. Towards the back of the restaurant there was a small flatscreen TV playing an episode of the Chinese version of The Voice on Windows Media Player (yeah, really). A girl was singing her heart out in what looked like a PJ ensemble...pretty entertaining. 

FOOD:
We started with the Green Onion Pancake (steal at only $2.99) and while it was good, the distribution of green onions was a little uneven. All the green onions seemed to pool to the right while the left had hardly any and was a bit bland. The green oniony side was nevertheless tasty. 

The dumplings here are sooo tasty! Definitely the shining point of our visit here and the reason for repeat visits. We ordered the classics: Shrimp and Chive Dumplings, Pork and Dill Dumplings, and Beef and Celery Dumplings. The dough was the good thick kind I remember from childhood and the fillings were flavourful. The dill was a bit overpowering at times but complimented the pork. Soo tasty!!

SERVICE:
Service left something to be desired. We were the only table at the restaurant and our food came in slow."}
{"text":"This place is packed all the time every single time I walk by. You can see the chefs at the front of the restaurant working away tirelessly wrapping each dumpling one by one.

Inside, the space is dingy, old, dirty, greasy and seats are very tight together. They will be sweeping and moping the floors at times as you are chowing down your dumplings. All this chaos and mess certainly has not deterred any patrons. This is however how a typical dumpling restaurant is and we've come to expect it.

The dumplings are good albeit a little greasy. The wrapper is nice and thin and if you get the pan fried ones there's a certain minor crispiness to them that is quite satisfying. They certainly taste freshly handmade and non-frozen but I find the fillings to be a bit lackluster. The various fillings are just not quite satisfying, the flavours of the ingredients are just not very pronounce for some strange reason. I do have to make a disclaimer though as I have had some of the best dumplings in my life in Japan a few years back and that everlasting memory has changed my perception of dumplings; it was like discovering butter for the first time!

The soup noodles are bland and bland so I wouldn't order them unless you need your palate cleansed with some hot bland soups.

I am in no way saying that these dumplings are bad but unfortunately I've been blessed (or cursed) to have had some of the best. I would say for dumplings this is probably one of the best prepared ones in the GTA just not quite the best tasting ones."}
{"text":"Their parsley dumplings are the best dumplings I've ever had.
I'm never a fan of dumplings, but their parsley dumplings are legit and that's the only thing I order there lol.
Their hot sauce is addictive.
The hostess is really welcoming."}
{"text":"Ordered fish boiled dumpling and pork cabbage steamed dumpling. Really delicious! The price is also nice and worth it."}
{"text":"The pork and chive dumplings were perfect. Will definitely be going back for more. I would recommend not getting the Groupon for this place. The dumplings are a must-try and they are quite inexpensive anyway."}
{"text":"Don't let the exterior fool you. This place is very quaint, and has a nice feel about it. The server was really super friendly but the food is great and the reason why I'd come back. I had the hot and sour soup, and some dumplings (of course). Fantastic and very reasonable."}
{"text":"This place is truly a GEM in the city!  I am a HUGE dumpling lover whether its Korean or Chinese style.  I know what a good dumpling is suppose to taste like!  I have tried many different places in Toronto and this place by far surpassed the rest!  My husband took me here as it is surprisingly close to our house and at first sight based on the location (off Dundas towards a small side street) I was VERY skeptical.  Don't be fooled by the exterior or interior of this restaurant.  Sure, it might not look like the fanciest place you've ever eaten at but the dumplings here area AH-MAZING!  I tried the steamed, pan fried and the steam bun and they were each equally drool worthy & amazing.  The steam dumplings are perfectly chewy on the outside and the inside was so juicy, flavourful and delicious.  The pan fried dumplings were perfectly crispy/cooked as well!  The steam bun dumplings were also wonderful!  I always have a hard time choosing between the 3 options and just order all 3.  The total price usually comes up to less then $27 for TWO people.  Amazing!  The little lady who works there is very friendly and always smiling every time we go there.  The food might take an extra few minutes as it is a smaller place but it is WELL worth the wait.  Don't forget to bring cash though!  I would highly recommend this to all of my family and close friends."}
{"text":"The food here are authentic northeast Chinese cuisine. Dumplings, onion pancake, chives cake, you name it. 

We ordered pork dumplings, sour cabbage sweet potato noodles and shredded potatoes. They taste good, but I think they did put too much vinegar in the dish. 

Restaurant is located in a basement, the waitress provides friendly service. Prices are fair. 

I would come back if I ever crave for dumplings again while I'm in Chinatown."}
{"text":"Almost did not go there because there were no customers.  The people that run the restaurant had such genuine smiles on their faces, we could not pass them by.  We ordered a lot of food from their menu.  Food was amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"Great service and dumplings are awesome. I had this super special corn flavored steamed dumpling. Wrapper had corn in it, inside was meat, a whole shrimp, mushroom and corn. All my fave things. Will def come back!"}
{"text":"Really quite great food at a reasonable price! Felt expensive for the area, but reasonable for Toronto overall. Service unfortunately was very slow, the dinner as a whole took over two hours when the restaurant was basically empty. The waitress spent 15 minutes speaking with her friend while we waited to pay for our bill. Overall would not return unfortunately."}
{"text":"Cheap, low key place with homemade dumplings. Love coming here.
You write your order on the roll of paper and it's a bit of a wait for the dumplings but well worth it. FYI the pan fried are opened and so less juicy than steamed/boiled. Try the meat pancakes too!"}
{"text":"I love my adoptive Asian mother. The dumplings are hand made with love, the wonton soup is hearty, and the pancakes are tasty. My little secret."}
{"text":"This place was delicious!! Although the wait was long, it was totally worth it since it was made fresh, in front of your eyes! We got around 7-8 dishes and it was all yummy! My favorite was the onion pancakes!"}
{"text":"This place was just ok for me. Service was slow, but pleasant. Everything was decent (pan fried and boiled dumplings, scallion pancakes, beef scallion pancake sandwich, soup dumplings), but my hopes were much higher based on the overall rating. My kids liked it a lot, so that was good. The biggest complaint would be that the soup dumpling had no soup. The scallion pancake items seemed somewhat undercooked. The dumplings were the best definitely the best part. We had pork, cabbage and cilantro in ours. I liked the choices they offered for types of filling."}
{"text":"We arrived at the restaurant at 11:30AM today on a typical Saturday (yes, that's pretty early).  We were the only ones there and I'm glad because it meant that our cook can focus on preparing our meal 100%.   The cook (which I'm guessing is the owner) is a very nice man and he was very attentive.  He made our dumplings from scratch and I'm very happy with what he prepared.

Overall, no complaints because the food was reasonably priced and came out on time.  Excellent customer service and I would definitely come back here in the future."}
{"text":"The shrimp fried rice is good and the bun. The pan fried dumplings are delicious. The soybean milk is also good."}
{"text":"If you have time to wait to get served, you won't regret eating here. 

I think this is the most delicious Chinese dumplings/noodles I've tasted. 

I deducted 1 star cuz of slow slow slow service and not accepting credit card and the Zha Jiang Noodle sauce was too salty."}
{"text":"A family trip brought us to Canada. After a tried day we ordered food from this restaurant. We ordered:
1- pork dumplings 
     100% handmade.  The meat inside is not dry at all. The veggie inside is freshly green and tasted really good. 
2-North Eastern Salad 
     Good size and folly worth that price. The cucumber is really fresh and u can tell by your eyes. They are carefully separated the sauce (well packed) for u. 
3- Cucumber & Pig Ears
     Pig ears is well marinated and well cooked. With that light spicy sauce. wow!
4- Beef Stuffed Pan Cakes (4 pieces) 
     So fresh and yummy. The sauce comes out after few bites. 
For the bonus they packed a coke for us. 
The deliver man is really nice and polite and food has been delivered with a short time.  We're really satisfied with this place. That makes me give 5 stars for this place. 
Many thanks."}
{"text":"I came here for dumplings cos Dumpling House Restaurant (my favourite dumpling spot in the city) is closed :(
Appearances don't really bother me, but I was disappointed to find out that all of the pan-fried shrimp dumplings contain pork .
I got chicken dumplings, which were \"ok\", & the portion was petite, I think I'll stick with Dumpling House Restaurant (where u can mix ur order, n there's not pork in everything )"}
{"text":"Came in from the US and was starving after a long day of flying. Got the wife out and said let's hit China Town and say hi to my Peeps! So Yelp on my side i decide to try out this place and boy thanks for steering me in the right direction. There's only two of us but I don't let that hold me back. I order the #9 cold cucumbers they do a great job , little bit of spice to the pickles and they cut and crush the so they absorb the magical marinade and are full of flavor and still have a crisp bite to them and at 2.50 you can't go wrong a definite order. Than it was an order of the #40 pan fried pork and cabbage dumpling just like mom used to make , well almost they actually do it up better than mom , when you order they get rolling and roll up the dough skin on the spot , put the delicious filling in and fry the bad boys up. (mom used to use store bought skins) Reminded me of saturday afternoons at home where we all used to sit around the kitchen dining table and help make dumplings for lunch. mmm , With a bit of grease from the dumpling one needs to cut it with something so an order of #62 the beef noodle soup. this was pretty good the bowl was gigantic enough for the two of us. This version uses a clear broth with chinese brocolli and delicate pieces of beef shank perfect on a rainy cold day, or hmm maybe tomorrow?? than the best for last it was the #55 Beef stuffed pancakes this was the star of the show. It had a beautiful fried crispy outside and when you bit into it the warm bun leeched out delicious beef juices it was like a fried xia long bao. An order came with 4 and I powered through 3 of them! a definite do not pass up. 2 days later we tried dumpling house on spadina they have bettter pan fried dumplings, but their cucumber salad was flavorless of the two come down here there's less of a wait and the #55 you MUST order it!"}
{"text":"The best dumpling shop I've came across in Toronto. 

Everything was made after I have put in my order and the chef working in the kitchen clearly knows what shes doing. Everything tasted fresh, homemade, and oozes the authentic flavour of northern china. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Very mediocre experience with the delivery.  Their online ordering site was very hard to navigate, especially when you cannot see what quantity you entered and always need to go back and edit. The food arrived about 15 minutes later than anticipated, and the delivery guy added a $2 tip for himself when he told my boyfriend, who opened the door, to pay. Nonetheless, we gave him a decent tip given it was an extremely cold winter night. 

The food was really average, very greasy pork buns and fried dumplings, the stir fried glass noodles with pork had very little protein, and became boring after two bites. The hot and sour soup was definitely a miss, however you get what you pay for with $2.99. 

Will be ordering from other dumpling places in Chinatown for take-out & deliveries."}
{"text":"Came here for a family meal and ordered A LOT of food! The service was really nice and friendly (one of the staff came through to wipe up our mess midway through) and I think everything is made when you order it. 

The best parts were the cucumber salad, the beef roll (had a very Peking duck feel), the chive (and egg) pockets (SUPER HOT, but SO DELICIOUS!), the spicy tofu (was very fragrant, and super flavourful; not mapa tofu). The Xiao Long Bao buns were super soft. 

The green onion pancakes were yummy too! Tried the steamed dumplings, the boiled fish ones...black crapas and chive? (which were surprisingly light and well flavoured), the hot and sour soup (yummy, but a single serving), fried pork and chive dumplings (these aren't super well closed, but okay).

It's a good price point!"}
{"text":"We came here hoping for some homestyle Northeastern Chinese food during the last day of our trip to Toronto and were really blown away by the quality and the price of this place. When we arrived at around 10:30PM, there was no one in the restaurant, but the owner greeted us warmly and gave us some suggestions on what to order.

There is a veritable smorgasbord of dumplings here and to top it off, every batch is made from scratch, dough and all. We ordered the northeastern salad, mutton and carrot potstickers, steamed pork and dill dumplings, boiled cucumber and egg dumplings, and beef pancakes. Everything was really delicious, with the potstickers being perfectly crispy and the steamed and boiled dumplings just right as well. The salad had tons of fresh veggies and was full of flavor with the sesame and mustard sauce, and the beef pancakes were crispy on the outside and full of flavor inside. The whole experience was really homey and it really warmed our hearts to see the owner making every bit of our order from scratch through the window to the kitchen. 

It's a mom and pop operation and there's never more than 3 people working at once, even though everything is handmade. The price point at this place is just fantastic for what you get, and we'll recommend any of our friends visiting Toronto to drop by!"}
{"text":"Cutest mom and pop shop. Really cheap for the amount we had. The steamed pork and chive dumpling skin was nice and chewy. Cucumber salad was very refreshing with the dumplings."}
{"text":"My family and I went there on Thanksgiving Day. Food was great, the service was excellent. The lady was so kind that she came to our table and asked us if everything was okay. I definitely will come back some day."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden jewel. They accept debit  cards. I am a fan of dumpling house but this place has more variety and range of menu items. Everything we ordered was great in taste. Sea weed salad, cucumber salad , spicy tofu, fish ball soup, mutton and chive dumplings, pork and shrimp dumplings and vegetarian dumplings were all great. Mutton and chives are the shining star though. All this for only $60. With an amazing friendly server. DEFINITELY GOING BACK AGAIN. 

cheers"}
{"text":"Restaurant tucked away in a corner of Chinatown.
We went there on a Saturday night and tried some of the traditional dumpling flavours - chive and pork, mutton and carrot, and the three delights. The dumplings we had was a mixture of the boiled and pan fried potstickers. We also had potato salad, beef pancakes, and zha jiang noodles! 

I'm originally from Northwestern China and I can attest to the true authenticity of this restaurant! The potstickers by far surpassed my expectations and brought me back to childhood! The dumplings are essentially freshly made right before they cook it to serve to you. The fresh dough that they make in house for the dumplings makes a huge difference in the taste and texture of the dumplings. Definitely highly recommend this restaurant and can't wait to be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Delicious dumplings that are truly \"home\" made. I peeked into the kitchen and you can see the staff making them without using any special equipment, they dont even have professional ovens. Everything we got was delicious. The place is low key and away from the main street."}
{"text":"You wouldn't believe the price for food this good!

Dumplings are very well-made (reminds me of those my grandma homemade back in China), and worth the word \"yummy\".

Buns are another recommendation of mine."}
{"text":"In my first review, I simply wrote \"OH GOD!\" because I enjoyed the food so much. But I went back two days later and came away with a more critical review. On first visit, the hot and sour soup knocked my socks off, but second time it seemed only a bit above average. Still good, but not as fresh.

And I now have an issue with the pan fried dumplings: they're made open-ended, more like little tubes. The problem is the filling tends to slip out mid-bite. 

But...this place still amazes. Both times I've gone, the Schweppes ginger ale was free.

I will be back to try some other dishes."}
{"text":"Best dumplings in Toronto. The owner is super nice, which makes the experience all the better.

D01, D02, and D03 (my favourite) on the menu are all a must. They have great noodle dishes as well. 

Such a great place to bring a group of friends and share a bunch of yummy stuff! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"As someone who was born in Beijing and has eaten his mom's dumplings every week when I was little, I can attest that this place is authentic. Not only the dumplings, but the steamed buns and small plates all taste like home. Don't be intimidated by the side street location. Far better than Mother's Dumplings."}
{"text":"If I could rate, less than one star I would, I ordered for delivery and not to mention the delivery was 2 hours late the restaurant is literally 15 minutes away, the food was brought cold and the delivery man who happened to be the boss acted clueless. We called numerous times to ask where our order was and once it finally came I called again and the women who picked up also acted clueless and had horrible english which was hard because I could not understand her. We never received an apology or explanation from either.

The food did not look like it did in the flyer, the website or the review page. The noodles were tasteless and cold and were not even the noodles we had ordered, we ordered buckwheat and they brought some white sticky noodle. the dumplings were way to salty and the wonton soup was way too spicy. They also added one drink, which we did not order. 

It was a shock to my family and I who were so excited considering a fair amount of their reviews here are positive, but we were all dissatisfied, hungry and didn't even bother finishing the food. Would NOT recommend and would suggest to get dumplings elsewhere."}
{"text":"This was one of the best places I went to in Toronto. I ordered the pork pan fried dumplings with cilantro I think and they were amazing! The people there are so sweet and very welcoming.i ended up getting around 3 orders of dumplings because they were that good! I had the chilli sauce (which is homemade) and it was delicious! If I ever visit Toronto again I will try and stop here again!"}
{"text":"The dumplings here are amazing.  Parsley (think it's cilantro which I love) with pork are so good we ended up ordering a second plate of them.  Got pan fried and used a combination of soya sauce and their hot sauce with chilis that is homemade - amazing.  Not fancy decor but the people are so sweet.  Make sure you stop here while in Toronto."}
{"text":"The first and only dumpling place I have tried through justeat since I moved here, and I am not going to look further if I am getting delivery. 

First time, I got the pork buns, xiaolongbao, and zhajiangmen. The second time, because I wanted to have the pork buns again (its one of those things that you have sudden cravings for), I got the pork buns, chive pockets, and the juicy pork buns. 

Absolutely get the pork buns, the fillings so juicy and oily, it is amazing. The red pepper oil they give you goes so well with the buns. A huge winner. Xiaolongbaos are smaller versions of the pork buns not soup dumps. So if you don't like the big buns and want it bite sized, get this instead of the pork buns. If you are looking for the classic soup dumps, they are called juicy pork buns here. They are good but pretty standard. 

Zhajiangmen was good but weird because it was a cold variation. Good experience but will not get it again. 

Even though it was delivered, the food was still pretty warm. One downside is that while the buns and pockets stay relatively warm, the soup dumps get cold really fast so eat them fast. I am sure when I eat there it would be even better. Can't wait to visit."}
{"text":"If you want authentic traditional Chinese food that an Asian mom would make...but without the constant nagging and questions as to why you're still single, THIS IS THE PLACE.

The husband and wife duo that run this place are the loveliest couple. The lady treated us like her own kids and even asked if we were full at the end.

Its simple, it's budget friendly, and it's delicious. 

PAYMENT: They take cash and debit only. 

FOOD: The soup dumplings are amazing! Zha jiang mian tastes like home. All the pancakes are delicious too.

MAJOR TIP:
The actual \"xiao long bao\" filled with soup is D02 called \"juicy pork buns\" and not D01. D01, \"xiao long bao\" has the same filling, but it's more of a classic bao zi wrap and much less soupy. 

I asked the owner why this is, and apparently a lot of westerners that come don't like the stickier skin the classic xiao long bao has, so they changed the menu item names. We made this mistake and had to order the right one after eating the first baos. Can't complain though, both were delicious!

They have a lot of different fillings for the various baos and pancakes. I WILL DEFINITELY BE BACK!"}
{"text":"really good portions, came here with my dad and we ordered beef noodles, steamed dumplings and seaweed salad. only paid about $20 but got a lot of food for that price. everything was fresh and homemade, tasted amazing. definitely coming here again"}
{"text":"The food is alright but the service is not so great. Waited for more than 30 minutes to get my food after the rest of my table was served their entire meal. Wouldn't go if I am in a hurry but otherwise good."}
{"text":"Awesome.

In a legit spot of Chinatown, no frills.  

You go in and you order a bunch of dumplings off a long list (with descriptions) and they come out rapid fire - very hot and fresh.

They fill you up fast but always over order - you don't want to find that you are left with an empty plate and a appetite."}
{"text":"Just like the name suggests, yummy dumplings that are healthier than those in similar spots ! The real crowd pleaser was the pork with pickled cabbage boiled dumplings. The wrapping was sweeter and soft while the filling was a little tangy and tasted very good with the vinegar dipping sauce. The XLB was very juicy and soft. 

The interior is very clean and has large tables for big groups. A very good spot !"}
{"text":"They certainly were yummy!

We tried the northern salad (think that's what it's called?), beef pancakes and four different types of dumplings.

I really enjoyed the selection here. A lot of unique options that you just can't find at Mothers or Dumpling house. They wrap each dumpling a little differently so everything looks especially homemade.

My fav dishes were the northern salad and the shrimp & pork fried dumplings. 

Staff was friendly. The place is in a somewhat hidden location which is great - no need to wait in line! Cosy booth type tables fit four. 

Ridiculously cheap. 4 gorged on 6 dishes which cost $13 each included tax and tip."}
{"text":"Perfect 2 bite dumplings!!! Dough perfect thickness and texture. Seasoning wasn't too salty with enough fat to carry out the flavor. The lady was so nice and happy. Kitchen was clean. Feels like eating at my mom's. Sooo good I'm drooling writing this review."}
{"text":"This place is where I go when I want fresh dumplings/noodles. Service is a little slow as everything is made to order. The owner is also very friendly and will always tell you to eat/order more. I love the cucumber and shrimp steamed dumplings! Very fresh and clean."}
{"text":"Steamed pork and chives dumpling was so juicy and tasty.  It almost reminded of good Chinese food home. the hot and sour soup is in a small bowl good for one person and i find it a bit pricey and a bit bland as well (added soy sauce) to match my taste. I finished my soup but my dumplings were still steaming so had to wait few more minutes (i was starving then). But all was good when i tasted them. The restaurant had a family vibe. The petite waitress is so polite and is always looking out for customers' need. I didn't felt intimidated at all when i entered this restaurant (coz i'm not Chinese, and just badly wanted to eat good dumplings that day), not like other (chinese) restaurants that you feel they won't serve you coz you dont understand them. Will be back for more dumplings soon!"}
{"text":"A hole in the wall restaurant with pretty decent dumplings. We got the cabbage and pork, cabbage/chive/pork, tofu, and xiao long bao. I was disappointed that my cabbage and pork only dumplings actually DID have chives in them and I hate chives, but nonetheless, the meal was pretty good! It wasn't too busy at all on a Saturday around 11:30. I recommend to get the soy milk and tofu dishes as well."}
{"text":"I dropped by for early dinner, and enjoyed the time being to the fullest! 
The owner lady is really nice and friendly, even though she doesn't talk much english. I went there alone but she still gave me the bigger seat, and was always smiling while I asked for their best menu.

I ordered boiled chive&egg dumplings and a small sized sour&spicy soup-The soup had a funny smell to it but was enjoyable all the same, and the dumplings were nicely hot and delicious. Would definitely come visit later!"}
{"text":"Dumplings is something I don't usually go out for since it can be easily made at home... BUT, I decided to try this place out with a friend yesterday because of the many AMAZING reviews by these yelpers. Verdict? The food does make you say 'yummy' twice just like their name, haha.

We ordered the Green Onion Pancake, Pan Fried Shrimp, Chives & Pork Dumpling and the Xiao Long Bao. I was kind of disappointed with the Green Onion Pancake because it wasn't as flavourful as I thought it would be. I felt like I was snacking on a piece of moist cardboard... I'd have to say it lacked a bit of salt, but I revived it with a bit of vinegar and chilly sauce. You gotta make the best out of everything right? Oh one more thing to keep in mind, these pancakes are drenched in oil. I had to pat it down with a napkin. (Not sure if it's usually like this here but the amount of oil in these bad boys are a bit too much compared to other places I've had it at). 
The Pan Fried Dumpling was pan fried to perfection. Not too fried but crispy enough for your taste buds and did I mention how tender and juicy the filling was?! Also, you can see that they use a generous amount of shrimp; they are not minced up so you can actually see the whole piece of shrimp. Lastly, the Xiao Long Bao was steamed just right! Soft on the outside and tender on the inside, nom nom nom.

Overall, the prices are fair. An order of the pan fried dumplings comes with 10 for around $5.99 - $7.99 (depending on what you order). My friend and I paid $10 each for the 3 dishes. From a quick browse of their menu, nothing appears to be over $10! 

If it satisfies my taste buds, fills my belly for $10... then I am a happy customer! I shall return for the other items on their menu. (:"}
{"text":"Decent dumplings had the pan fried dumplings and the XLBs - the only thing was that the meat was veryyy salty. The owners on the other hand were very sweet! Although the location is off a side road on Dundas it was still pretty pricey."}
{"text":"Ok. I'm going to be honest.  When I first walked up at 11am (their opening time), it was closed.  Then the owners came right at 11am and opened and told us to come in (in their limited English).  So we walk down the stairs and weren't sure how things would turn out.
We were a little skeptical this place would be good.  But we were wrong.   They gave us a menu and asked us to write down the letter/number associated with what we wanted to order. We ordered a wonton soup, steamed shrimp/pork/cabbage dumplings, a pork sticky bun and a red bean pancake.  Yeah, it was really good.  All were freshly made (always get the steamed because they make it fresh).  Service was very friendly and attentive.  Everything was tasty and we thoroughly enjoyed our lunch."}
{"text":"Love this place ! Their dumpmings r soo good!

Aft seeing other's reviews indecided to give it a try. The restaurant is on a side street with almost no foot traffic . Id their reviews r good their customers must be happy returning ones or introduced by the happy ones !
  
The dumplings r big n fluffy !! Unlike The Dumpling House where their dumpings have thick dough, small fillings no meat juices , this place their dumplings  they have normal dough thickness n large filljng also when u bite into it , the juices floats!! 

I didnt eat in , i bought bunch house premade frozen ones to wait till my bf to come home . Its first time i wonder restaurant made frozen ones VS Grocery  store ones. Cuz these frozen ones r still pricy($20 for 35 dumpings). My bf was boiling these , i was in the other room, i could jjst smell the beautiful fragrance in the other room!! There is NO doubt factory ones wont be as fresh and fragancy like these !!!! The beautiful fragrance filled my place for whole 20 min!!! N the dumpmings came out as fresh as they r freshly made!! I heard those reatsursnts only pre make these evey 2/3 days , sometimes same dsy. so I assume these r as fresh as we made them home n put in freezer. I bought beef n celery($10 for 15), Pork n chive ($10 for 20). My bf made strong statement these r definitely way better than grocery store ones . 


I am def going back to get more of those juicy meaty flufdumplings they !!!! Better than Dumping House and Mama's dumplings!! Id love to dine in there next tome :) :):)"}
{"text":"My Yelp Friend dragging me around looking for some cheap and tasty Chinese food in the area which is not as easy as one expected with all these Chinese restaurants.

Yummy Yummy Dumpling is definitely quite yummy.

Deco is simple and down to earth with a family vibe.

We ordered:

Shredded Potato Salad ($1.99)

Beef Stuffed Pancakes ($6.99) 
- Love all the meat juice inside the pancake and it is well seasoned! Just be caution when eating, if not you will splashed all the juice on yourself and dinner mate!

Steamed Pork and Chives Dumplings ($5.50)
- nicely done and delicious

Yummy Yummy Dumpling is definitely a solid dumpling place if you want to have some decent food in the area."}

Will repeat visit when I am in the area."}
{"text":"Fell pretty short on my expectations. The dumplings were prepped fresh but the seasoning was bland, and a few hours after I am nursing a mean stomach ache."}
{"text":"BLAND.

Bland, bland, bland. NOT something that Chinese food is supposed to be.

I had the chive pancakes, the pan-fried buns, and shrimp, pork, and chive boiled dumplings. Not even a hint of seasoning between the three of them. I've had authentic Chinese food on four continents, and I have NEVER had Chinese this under-seasoned before. 

Oh, and they didn't squeeze the liquid out of the chive pancake filling, so watery juice either spurted out of the pastry or dribbled down your chine when I bit in. Eurgh."}
{"text":"Ordered pork buns, beef pancakes, steamed shrimp dumplings, and beef noodles. Recommend everything minus the beef noodles. 

Delivery was fast."}

{"text":"This is our go-to dumpling place. Simple, no frills. Fresh ingredients, homemade dumplings - made while you wait.  We always eat way too many! 
The staff are really nice and the food is always yummy yummy.
You can buy frozen dumplings to take home, too.
We love you, Yummy Yummy Dumplings!"}
{"text":"Such a good find! Hidden in a side street off Dundas.. usually would not have gone in if it wasnt for yelp... been here twice already!
Solid cheap, asian comfort food that tastes just as great. You can see them make the dumplings in the back. The owner is really friendly and welcoming as well."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, the dumplings at Yummy Yummy Dumplings were not yummy.  

We tried 2 kinds of dumplings, the black carp & chive boiled dumpling and the mutton & carrot pan-fried dumpling. The black carp & chive fillings was flavourless and mushy. 1 star

The mutton & carrot filling was less bland but also not a great texture. A huge problem for these pan-fried (mutton) dumplings was their poor construction.
Whoever made them left the skins/wrappers completely open, which makes it impossible to seal the juices inside the dumpling while it's being cooked. It's not that the wrappers had split open by mistake, by the way. On the contrary, no attempt had been made to seal up the dumpling.  The edges of the wrapping were only pressed together at one point. I would avoid getting any pan-fried dumplings here again. 2 stars

We also had a stuffed pancake with pork. It was fried up well, so that it had a crispy seared side on both sides. The filling was dense and not very tasty. The dough is thick. In some places, it's so thick that there's no pork stuffing there.  I would not get this again. 1.5 stars

The highlight of the meal was the Northeastern salad. It had fresh strips of vegetables and egg and wide noodles, with a delicious mustard and sesame paste dressing / sauce. Simple and refreshing. I loved it & I'd definitely get this again if I came back. 5 stars 

The food averages closer to 2 stars than 3 stars, but I'll give 3 stars since service was friendly & that Northeastern salad was great.  I don't know where else to get that salad & it's what I'd come back for. I'd avoid the dumplings here though."}
{"text":"Bought a 5.5$ pancake downstairs at night, the servant aaked us to go upstairs for the payment if we use credit cards. Nevertheless, the owner declined us to use credit cards and said it is cash only. If we want to pay the US dollars, they can do it with 1:1 . So finally we have to pay 5.5 US dollars with a 10 dollars... the food is good though, but I hate the owner who earn profit by unfair means."}
{"text":"This was our first dinner in town.  We were both exhausted after a long day of travel and wanted something familiar.  So we ended up walking the mile to get here from where we were staying.  

I approached somewhat apprehensively because it appeared to be down a flight of stairs from street level but once we were inside, it was ok.  The tables are somewhat crowded together so you'll always be doing passive aggressive chair battle with the person behind you.

As we tend to do, we ordered a lot of food.  The lady did not stop us but looked upon us with apparent joy and amusement. 

We ordered: the cucumber salad, North-Eastern Salad (only after we were told they were having problems making the jelly, caraway, carrot & garlic app), the xiao long buns, the juicy pork dumplings, the pork/shrimp/chive pan-fried dumplings and the chive/mushroom/vermicelli \"pancakes\".  

The cucumber salad was not very marinated and sweeter than I liked but ended up being a refreshing touch to our meal.  The North-Eastern salad ended up being my favorite version of this dish ever.

As for the pork buns/dumplings, I'm still not sure which was which.  The thin skinned ones you normally get at places like Din Tai Fung was pretty decent, except the skin kept breaking regardless of how gently we picked it up.  The other \"buns\" were like \"baos\" and not as impressive to us.

Finally, the remaining items - shrimp/pork/chive pan fried dumplings and the chive, mushroom, vermicelli pancakes were very good both at the time and as leftovers for breakfast.

The lady was very nice to us and the food really hit the spot.  A great meal overall."}
{"text":"Food and drink: The dumplings are amazing - flavourful and not oily / heavy (when steamed). I had the chive, mushroom and vermicelli dumplings and will definitely be back for more. Good value for money! I would recommend sticking to the dumplings though - had the green onion pancakes and it was pretty flavourless, not well salted, and quite greasy. A friend had the xiao long bun but wasn't quite what he expected (though still decent overall). 

Service and atmosphere: It is definitely your basic setting with old cafeteria style tables and booths that don't feel all that clean. The plus is you can see into the kitchen and watch them make your food, so you know how fresh everything actually is. Service was pretty slow because they seemed to be prioritising delivery orders. Also be careful - they only take cash and debit."}
{"text":"This is definitely a gem in Chinatown. 

Unlike the more flashier places on spadina or Dundas this place is more hidden on Huron road but it's definitely a hidden gem! 

Food is extremely cheap - $8 for 20 dumplings and they have some pretty authentic Chinese dishes. Food was delicious as well! 

Service was a little on the slower end but other than that it's definitely worth a visit if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"It is ok to eat there,if u around the restaurant.But it doesn't deserve 5 star rating."}
{"text":"Lives up to its name! I had the green onion pancakes, soup buns, and the chicken wing skewer and all for around $20. The portions are surprisingly big and service was very friendly. Would definitely come back for more!"}
{"text":"Delish! 11 items for a total of $83 including tax. I would really recommend:
- Shrimp chive dumplings $7: got eaten the fastest
- Glass noodles $7: huge portion with some beef and cabbage. Likely cured on of my friend's hangovers. Very tasty 
- Pork cabbage dumplings $7: another favorite
- Mutton pickled cabbage dumpling $8: well seasoned and tasty 
- Spicy soup $8: great soup base with lots of fun toppings like tofu skin, lotus root, ham, spicy mustard, ect 

I also liked the chive pockets $6.50, there were 4 in the order. It was super with just a bit of shoyu on the outside. Perhaps skip their red bean buns $7 for 4 large ones. The inside was a bit dry and there was a too much bun for my taste. The beef noodle soup would be great on a cold day, but didn't have a ton of flavor to the broth. 

Honestly, I would stop by here if you are in the mood for some pretty amazing dumplings. They certainly know what they are doing. You will not be sad that you tried eating there!

Hint: go with a smaller group. We had 8, which was overload-city for them."}
{"text":"Cheap, delicious dumplings made to order! best time to go is an hour before closing wen it's quieter. you have to walk down the stairs to this cozy nook so it's a delightful getaway. I got E04 shrimp, pork and cabbage dumplings  ($8) and this B01 shredded potato salad ($3.50) was tasty. I'm not a fan of the rice congee but that potato salad is good. Meal by myself of these 3 things came up to $15."}
{"text":"Food: 3/5, small portion
Service: 4/5
Interior and Environment: 2/5
Cost: $15/person

Summary: I don't understand why this place has such a good reviews on Yelp. Maybe we just ordered the wrong thing. Out of all the dumpling and Northern Chinese restaurants in Chinatown, I would rank in the lower end.
What I like: the food tastes OK, but the portion is small.

We visited this place because it has a high score on Yelp. This place took us a while to find because it is not on Dundas street, it is at a basement on Huron. I would imagine this place to be pretty popular since the reviews are so good, however, when we entered, there was no one in the restaurant.
During the time we were there, there are only 2 tables including us.
We ordered fried noodles, beef pancake wrap, and glass noodles for two of us. The portion is pretty small and we are definitely not full afterward. Maybe we should only order dumplings here?
It is pretty authentic northern Chinese style, however, in Chinatown, there are so many other good restaurants that I think would be better than this one. I don't really recommend it."}
{"text":"Had the $20 Groupon deal. You can only choose from the special Groupon menu: 2 soups (3 choices), 2 salads (3 choices), 2 kinds of dumplings (can choose from the main menu). Hot & sour soup was mediocre, not much taste to it. Shredded potato salad was also just ok. Seaweed salad was gross; it was like straight from the ocean. Maybe I'm just used to Japanese seaweed salad?? 

Dumplings were ok. Not amazing. Pan-fried dumpling were only fried on one side and the sides were open, so all the stuff kept falling out. Steamed dumplings were good. 

Overall, just ok place...I'd eat here again but only with the $10 for $20 Groupon deal."}
{"text":"Service lady from Dongbei province. We order the sea-tent with very good taste. Recommend the dumpling (pork meat & shrimps) here. Small but lovely place."}
{"text":"Has anyone ever told you this place is yummy? No? Well, let me be the first one...

Yummy Yummy Dumplings is a lovely, clean-tasting cheap Chinese option with an adorable name. Seriously, say it out loud and try to keep a straight face. If you did that  successfully, I'm sorry to be the first to tell you: You're a robot. Shitty. 

Things that aren't shitty? Their delightful dumplings. I really enjoyed my pork and chive dumplings and my pork bun, as well as their hot and sour soup and beef noodle soupy dish (I'm so bad with names:/). 

Their menu is extensive and not the norm in Chinatown, and if you heart dumplings and hate MSG you will surely be a fan."}
{"text":"Tearing up just thinking about all the times I'll never be able to stroll on over to Yummy Yummy Dumplings for a plate of homemade dumplings. Let me begin with a little harangue on the status of dumplings in New York City: Prosperity dumplings is crap. Popular to white people only because their clueless asian friends bring them there, they've gotten into the habit of stuffing their dumplings with the leftover meats unwanted by any other vendor or restaurant owner, and this is evident from each undelicious, gelatinous and unchewable bit. Vanessa's Dumplings, a popular chain, serves cheaper dumplings as well, and while slightly better in quality they tend to be exorbitantly greasy and salty. Then you've got the fake eco-friendly Whole Foods copycat that is Mimi Cheng's, which in my opinion takes dumpling making in the complete wrong direction by trying to serve \"free-range chicken\" dumplings and other \"healthier\" types of dumplings.

All of the above are disgusting. And more importantly, it leaves me with few options in the city when I have a massive dumpling craving. Enter the beauty that is Yummy Yummy. We scouted this place on the first day we were in Toronto at the recommendation of a friend and the owner eagerly tried to push a new concoction that she had made, which was essentially homemade red bean buns. We begrudgingly passed as we had dinner plans but noted that the owner was incredibly friendly and genuine in her recommendation. The next day we came back and ordered pork dumplings along with fish dumplings--which I thought would be super weird but ended up being freaking delicious. Everything was freaking amazing. It's real filling with absolutely no excess salt and incredibly refreshing to eat. She also offered us a tofu salad on the house and omggggggg it was soooooo... real and traditional. Having few Northern Chinese dining options in the city, this place absolutely made me feel at home. The Cantonese and Taiwanese influences in the NYC Chinatown have really watered down what once might have been great Chinese food. Now it's just all sweet and greasy. 

Oh and the red bean buns? Out of this world. It wasn't overly sweet as you may have already experienced from other Asian pastries that you've had. And the bun was soft and fluffy and--I just can't anymore. Thinking about all of this delicious food is making my mouth water and there's nothing I can do about it. Until next time, Toronto."}
{"text":"Really tasty and at good prices! I couldn't find a Groupon for when I wanted to go but the prices are very reasonable w/o a discount. The panfried dumplings were really tasty! I came at the end of the night, so the owner gave me all his leftover seaweed for my seaweed salad, which made me very happy :). Would definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Ordered soup dumplings and pan fried dumplings plus spicy/sour soup.  Dumplings were not very good, slightly worse than what you can buy at the supermarket and make yourself.  Never got to try soup dumplings because they made the wrong thing--got steamed buns instead.  Spicy/sour soup was like water and had a layer of goop on top.  Prices are about same as Asian Legend so I was wishing I had gone there instead.  Must have changed chefs or something because this is NOWHERE near 4-star quality."}
{"text":"Lovely service, very friendly and sweet. It is a small place on the basement level with booths and tables. You order by writing the letter/number of the menu item in a roll of paper. From there the magic happens. Dumplings are made from scratch, to order. And they are solid. 

Especially yummy are the pan fried buns. And their dumplings aren't the only good things. Get the Family Style tofu. Delicious soft tofu fried with cilantro.

Six of us ate for $60 before tip!"}
{"text":"Very nice staff and super good food. A must place if you like spicy food. I heard other things are very good too :))"}
{"text":"Surprised I haven't written a review of this place yet. Their North Eastern Salad is delicious and sneakily hot. The thin cucumber sticks and carrots feel all nice and refreshing while the heat slowly builds up in your mouth. The combination of peanut sauce and sesame oil and dry mustard is just so good. This is a great dish to balance out any oily/heavier dishes. The dish comes with ground pork, but the last time I ordered it they forgot to put it in (which was totally fine with me actually, I preferred it that way! I'll order it without pork next time.) ($7)

I normally get their panfried dumplings ($7) but, is it just me or have they been coming out more on the burnt end?? Not completely burnt but lotsa black. I'll have to try again and see what happens. Pics to come for both dishes. If I worked in the area, I would come here a lot more often."}
