{"text":"I've been coming to Gyro Time for almost 20 years (all locations). The quality of food has always been consistent and tasty. I tend to order mine with light onions/no onions depending on my preference for that day, but nonetheless it's always delicious. 

They make my favorite salads ever! Ingredients are fresh, customer service is spot on, and the cost isn't too bad. 

If you've never been here, take the chance and try it! I promise you won't be dissapointed!"}
{"text":"Gyro Time is Gyro Time.... I was at airport picking up friends and family. Saw the huge sign, drove to the Location on Eastern/Sunset, got there 30 min before closing, two employees inside were cleaning up, store was closed. Went back the next day for lunch, got there at 10:30am: Closed, they open at 11am. We tried the Sub place next door. Went back two weeks later, that was on 3/4 yes, yesterday: Imagine how thrilled I was to be there, it was open!!! I placed my order, was tasting that Gyro, .... then.... They refuse to take the only cash I had on me, a $50 bill, the girl said the manager was adamant about taking my $50... she refused to take my cash, I was left dumbfounded... I asked if there was a manager on duty, which could help my thirst for their food, and give me some change, I was begging... Well, that didn't happen... I walked away, drove next door to Carl's Jr to get me a great Chicken Burger... and they took my $50 bill... Oh well, that only meant one thing: for me to stay away from Gyro Time!... Customer Service = 0"}
{"text":"Good steak and lamb. Big fan of the fries and the yogurt sauce is sooo yummy. Love taking my friends out for casual lunches."}
{"text":"Stopped here after bad experience at pizza joint next door. Food is good for a fast food place, had better gyro s in Vegas but they are all sit down restraunts. Staff very nice and happy which was great. Prices are very fair, $9 for gryo sandwich and drink."}
{"text":"Tried this place yesterday, and I am so happy I live close to here, because their gyro's are excellent!!  the lamb is spiced perfectly!!!  I will become a regular at this place."}
{"text":"Holy Pita....this place is pretty good! It's only got a couple traditional dishes. Mostly it revolves around the gyro. But my gosh is it good meat!  The tzaziki sauce (cucumber sauce) is ok. I've had better. But it's good. I can tell you this I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Gyro Time for 37 years. I started at there original location on Sandhill,which is no longer there. The quality of food has been fantastic every time in that 37 years. I believe having the same family running it for that same period of time is the reason it is so great. Thanks!"}
{"text":"This place is off the chain.  Best Gyro in the world!  Simple and delicious!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Tasty but expensive. Prices comes with Taxes."}
{"text":"Gyro time is awesome. I have been coming here for fifteen years or more and it is always good. My favorite is the Grilled chicken sandwich, with grilled onions and an order of fries. Everything about the sandwich is great--the chicken (which there is plenty of) the pita (which always is fresh) and the cucumber sauce. Their fries are always crispy on the outside and soft in the middle, which is good considering these are not skinny fries. As for service, the owner always seems to hire high school kids, but he trains them to be polite, efficient, and accurate. They do a nice job. If you want a good sandwich, go somewhere else; if you want a great sandwich, go to Gyro Time."}
{"text":"-Great prices. Cheaper than the sit down restaurants, and you get your moneys worth! 

-Their sauces are really flavorful. The tzatziki has a very fresh, tangy, and cooling taste to it. It's also thick, not runny like others. Their feta dressing for the salads is also really good - I'd recommend it for the salad. 

-Fast service, but nothing is of poor quality.

-The gyros come with lots of meat, fresh vegetables, and they are NOT greasy. It's refreshing to get a gyro that's not dripping in grease, especially at a quick service place like Gyro Time. 

-I'm very thankful to have this place in Las Vegas, and that it's lasted so long."}
{"text":"Expensive, insipid and no customer service. If you go there be ready to spend too much money for a gyro. Oh and don't go there hungry or you'll come out broke and still hungry. No garlic add on anything? Greek Gods are shamed of you."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Gyros were delicious, on super-soft pita bread, perfectly seasoned meat, onion, tomato and a generous portion of tzatziki on the side. The staff was really friendly and welcoming too- perfect place for a classic gyro!"}
{"text":"The gyro was alright. Found two hairs in my fries before starting them. 

Wonder how many were in the sandwhich I ate

Nasty."}
{"text":"Gross just gross go to Mediterranean Grill caffe' for the most delicious gyro! It's on lake mead not far from here."}
{"text":"I have been looking for a decent gyro place since I moved here from Chicago, and I'm very happy I found gyro time. Gyros have a good amount of meat on them, which is the biggest problem I've had at other places around here. Skimpy ass gyros! Who wants that? Anyways I can't comment on anything else there, but gyros are pretty good and inexpensive."}
{"text":"I'm greek, and grew up in a greek town in New York, so I know how the food should be made and taste. The gyro was RAW and when I approached the Mexican cooks they said that's how we make them! Don't go for you will get sick. This place is the worst."}
{"text":"Always delicious! The employees are always friendly,  and attentive. The gyros are always fresh, and the cucumber sauce is nom, nom, nom."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good.  My wife and I just visited this place for the first time and really liked it.  We each had their Original Gyro Time gyro.  They had a ton of nicely flavored meat on them, tomatoes and onions.  The sauce came on the side and was very good.  We'd have preferred to have some lettuce and feta on them, but the default configuration is still excellent (and filling).  Next time we're there, we'll ask them to add those things (it looks like the feta will cost a bit extra).  While we were eating, we also noted that a lot of people were ordering their fries.  They *looked* darn good, so we'll probably try those next time, too (though the sandwich alone is already more than enough food).  It's a bit expensive for, essentially, a gyro in a fast-food setting.  But, overall, I think it's worth it."}
{"text":"Having lived in Greece for more than 10 years I can definitely state that although the food is edible it has little resemblance to the real Greek gyros.

Salad - very fresh and crisp. 
Gyro time sandwich - mediocre at best. The Pita although the correct type it was not properly prepared. Meat was not that tasty. Not Greek style for sure.
Grilled chicken sandwich- no flavor same problem.

Cucumber sauce - it is supposed to be made from yogurt, cucumber, garlic and vinegar. This sauce was sour cream cucumber and some salt. Far from nom nom. It was fresh and edible.

Place was clean and they provided a good service."}
{"text":"I have been friends with the owners for many years even before Gyro Time opened in 1978. The food has always been excellent & continues to get better, with bigger servings and more tasty yummy cucumber sauce. Today I got to sample their soon to be added gyro slider, a BBQ gyro with cheese & bacon on a mini pita for about half the price of a gyro. That's gonna be an extremely delicious addition to an already great menu! So definitely visit anyone of their 3 locations or try them all!"}
{"text":"The customer service was great as the people were very friendly and helpful. I had never eaten here but I wanted to try it for a while because I really like gyros, so I took my sister for lunch. We got the original time, the chicken, some fries and a couple of drinks. The food was ok at best. Turns out while my sister really likes gyro meat, this food made her very sick as it did me. I have a feeling it was the dill sauce since it didn't taste right and it was warm (not good for a yogurt based product. I also felt the chicken was flavorless which was weird because it didn't look that say. I would be willing to try it again but I will definitely be careful with that sauce..."}
{"text":"My first time at Gyro Time (a while back) I ordered their Greek salad was very unimpressed. The salad was bland and boring. I never really gave it a second thought to come back. Tonight I was really craving Mediterranean food and since Gyro time is right around the corner from me, I decided I would give another try. I ordered the chicken sandwich, which is grilled chicken, tomatoes, and ice berg lettuce with cucumber sauce on the side. Again, I was disappointed. I wouldn't say that it's bad, more so that it's completely bland and not very flavorful. The chicken takes like it was marinated in water with a some sprinkled pepper and salt. I added a bit of the cucumber sauce for flavoring and it didn't make much of a difference. Overall, I don't think I will come back and try this place again. I would much rather drive out of my way and stick to my regular go to for Mediterranean, Sultan's Grill."}
{"text":"For years we ate Gyro Time food. We recently made a purchase here about1/2 hour before closing. We learned they forgot to put our Falafels in the bag when my wife got home. She went back the next day about 20 minutes before close with the receipt to see if they would reimburse her. They would not because she came in just 10 minutes  pass their 24 hour reimbursement time limit. We never went back and found much better food elsewhere. Now we know their food is below average. Thanks Gyro Time you are not missed!"}
{"text":"They get a 5 because there's no 4.5. The service is awesome. Today we came in around 4:30 and the guy taking our order was super nice and genuine. Not fake at all. We had a difficult order because my daughter is allergic to everything and he still made everything seem like it was no big deal. When I gave him the wrong amour when paying he never gave me a stink face. When I asked for extra hot sauce the other attendant was polite also. Then when we were done he came around and asked about our meal. What fast food restaurant has nice service like this. This dude was genuinely nice and made us have a better day and we will g to this location even if it's far because of his exceptional service.
Manager please give this guy a raise! :)
The gyro was great. Onions weren't too strong. They actually were sweet. We always order extra meat and it really was overflowing."}
{"text":"Been coming to this place for the last 25+ years, best gyro and tzatziki (yogurt sauce) in town! I stop in for a gyro whenever I'm in the area. Glad to see this place is stilll open and doing well after all these years."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years to get my comfort food!  I've never ordered anything but the Gyro meal and a fruit punch.  The meal comes with a gyro sandwich and french fries and a drink.

I always get the gyro with the sauce that they provide and I always ask for hot sauce to dump on top.  I then savor the moment and proceed to get my \"swerve\" on.

The food is consistently delicious, always hot and never have to wait more than a few minutes while they make it fresh.

Totally digging this joint!"}
{"text":"A bit of background: my parents, the most venerable Papa Hawk and Mama Hawk, started going here when it first opened in '78.  When I returned from my military-and-college world tour in '81, they turned me on to the place.  I've never known it to attempt to claim \"authentic Greek-style Greek food,\" but it's always been good, wholesome grub.  Now, I admit that I was a big fan of the \"pocket gyro\" (the regular sandwich fixings stuffed inside a pita pocket), and I was a bit disappointed when they took that item off the menu, but yesterday's meal was still the same good food I remember for the last 30+ years.  The meat is good, the fries are excellent (somehow subtly different than regular old French fries), the cucumber sauce an excellent accompaniment to the sandwich itself (and not bad to dip the fries in, either), and the baklava was good, the last time I had it (I was diagnosed diabetic in 2000, so I've not been ordering that for a while).

Fancy?  No.  \"Authentic Greek\"?  Probably not.  Tasty food at good value in a friendly atmosphere?  You bet.  The Great Bearded Bird will be back.

{"text":"Staff very friendly. Greek salad with gyro meat was delicious. Bed of romaine lettuce red onions,peppercini, cucumber, tomatoes,feta cheese slices of Gryo meat on top w/ feta dressing. Husband and daughter had gyro. The gyro had a lot of meat onion and tomato eaten with cucumber dressing. They enjoyed it. Over all great meal."}
{"text":"This place is definite go-to for us. Very good food, fresh ingredients, consistent taste. We both always order the GYRO TIME... Have never tried anything else here because it never disappoints. Generous amount of meat, warm thick pita bread, fresh tomatoes and onions. Comes with a side of tzatziki sauce.

The thing that makes this place amazing is I have to say their tzatziki sauce is my all-time favorite among ANY other gyro place I've tried! It is probably the standard of which I rate others. Seriously so fresh, so savory and so light... pairs perfectly with the gyro! 

Only downfall is this place does not open until 11am, and they close relatively early at 8pm. 

Be advised they are closed on Sundays as well! (I've made the mistake of going, lol) :P"}
{"text":"These guys are always awesomeness, feel like it's the only place I can drive thru and not be scared that my order is gonna be Fn ruined, food is always on point and as ordered . Staff is polite and helpful. No complaints all is good"}
{"text":"Pros:
OLD SCHOOL, I've been going to this place ever since I was a kid.
Introduced me to that wondrous thing called the gyro.
The meat is always juicy and filled with spice.
They offer hot sauce, which tastes amazing on a gyro if you ask me. 

Cons:
A tad steep.
I've always been a bit off put by how it's trying to be like McDonald's Greek Style. :/

I've been going to Gyro Time for as long as I can remember. I don't go as often as I like seeing the prices but man is this some good comfort food. Don't forget to try the baklava."}
{"text":"on the higher end of price scale, but solidly good sandwich
full of meat, the Gyrotime sandwich delivers.
Long on flavor & texture. The most decent gyro in Vegas
Fries are nothing special but always hot & crispy, that is a plus
This is a no frills type place, so you dont come for the decor...come eat the gyro."}
{"text":"They have the WORST customer service I've ever encountered. I've been to this location more time than I can count, but today, apparently, my usual order is suddenly not okay. Now I'm not the special one who came up with the pricing, but my request is simple - pita, gyro meat, cheese. Not so hard right? Well, apparently it is. The Gyro Time and the BBQ gyro are the same price, but the bbq one comes with cheese. So why pay extra to get it on the plain gyro (gyro time) when it comes on the other one for the same price. But today, for whatever reason, when I asked to sub the BBQ meat for the regular one, they \"can't to do it\" and \"our boss wouldn't like it\". Well, you've been doing it for months. Consistency folks, consistency. Then that short little girl at the register got nasty about it. This is so absolutely ridiculous. Well, they definitely lost a frequent customer and all future recommendations over some cheese. Hope it was worth it. #byefelicia"}
{"text":"True Middle Eastern food, well, as close to it as you can get without the sand. Reasonably priced and great for lunch. Wish it were open later"}
{"text":"Came in today and tried there Steak Gyro with fries and drink food was good, will come back"}
{"text":"Gotta say this place is always comes through when I need it. Very conveniently located to my house and only com plate is that it closes at 8. 

As far as food is great! I usually always order the grilled chicken or the original gyro wrap. Comes with tones of meat and vegetables, and come with a delicious side of cucumber sauce. I also like the fact that is comes on the side for I think you get a little more and it make the wrap not get all messy. 

Another great option they have is that they have a vegan option for their is no egg in the pita and the falafel. So gf loves that and she gets in a wrap or salad. 

And for sides they have very good French fires or on the healthy side they have grilled zucchini. 

On another note the staff is super friendly and always has a smile."}
{"text":"They use sour cream in their taziki sauce. ....why? They don't have very much flavor in the Gyro meat."}
{"text":"Our first time trying Gyro Time and we will definitely come back. The staff was very friendly and polite.  The young man that helped us thanked us after we paid. How unusual is that now and these days so we were off to a great start!  We ordered their regular gyro and gyro with bbq sauce.  The meat on both of the gyros were flavorful, tender and delicious.  The  pitas were still warm when we received ours and they are very generous with the tzatziki sauce that came on the side which was a bonus!  Most gyro restaurants we have been to are very stingy with the sauce.  Overall, great first time experience and will be back."}
{"text":"I think there is 3 locations in Vegas.I heard a lot about it, so I decided to try it. Meat is very tasty..Pita was soft and hot. Onions raw and tomatoes. Nothing overpowering. Cucumber sauce was mild,  actually a little bland. but with the seasonings of the meat, it was a great combination. It was a taste that I was looking for, nothing over the top, but this was also my first time trying a gyro, pretty much ever. I left satisfied, and I would definitely come back. Maybe I'll bump it up to another star,when I try something else."}
{"text":"I Ordered the original, which includes two types of meat, lettuce, onions and cucumber sauce. The meat all looked the same so I don't know if there were two types.   Judging from my sandwich that was missing the lettuce and tomatoes, my guess is there was only one. All things considered, it still tasted good. This place went from zero to 60 in a matter of minutes and the people seem content.  The amount of food for the price is good. Maybe I'll try it again."}
{"text":"Very sad that a restaurant would give someone the WRONG TAKE OUT food TO BEGIN WITH (but shit happens) so we get home 114* temp outside find out it was WRONG ....but never the less it was a hot exhausting day and didn't want to drive back all the way to this place to get the correction made (therefore) only one person got to eat.  I called them to tell them what had happened and they said they would give us credit on only the one meal........but with gas, time, and travel and heat WE felt that beings our dinner plan was ruined that it would be nice if they would credit two meals (JUST FOR THE BOTHER).  My God If you are at a restaurant and they screw up on one persons order the meal is comped, because the second person doesn't want to eat in front of the other person with no food. Therefore they comp the meal for two......this doesn't hardly ever happen where a restaurant screws up but at GYRO TIME it did!  When I had asked for a comp for both driving time and gas and heat  they basically may as well of said HELL NO!!!!!  Poor customer relations in our opinions!!!!!!  Hell, I guess they think GAS AND TIME ARE FREE!!!!!!
WE WILL NEVER GO BACK TO THIS ESTABLISHMENT.  I suppose that one GYRO is more important than customer service /customer care.  This is all in our opinion and we will never go back to a place that in our opinion cares MORE ABOUT LOSING ONE GYRO MEAL than they do about their own customers satisfaction.  A FREAKING joke!  IF I COULD CHOSE O STARS THIS IS WHAT i WOULD HAVE CHOSEN."}
{"text":"I saw the billboards and drove past this place, thinking surely a place with a drive thru did not warrant this much excitement. Like other reviewers, I too expected this place to be equivalent to McDonald's take on \"authentic Greek food\". Oh how wrong I was.

GYRO SLIDER- a baby gyro, complete with tomato and onion, and a cup of the famously delicious cucumber cream sauce. It's about five bites, the perfect size for a large snack, or just grab two for a meal. Meat is overflowing and tender, just the right light amount of veggies to add balance, all wrapped in warm pita. Yeah, I used the entire cup of cucumber sauce on this little thing. And loved it all.
SPANAKOPITA- about $4 and easily the largest piece of spanakopita I've ever had, even comparing it to more formal sit-down restaurants. Well-priced for good value, and on top of that, it's freaking delicious: light flaky phyllo dough, tons of creamy feta cheese and spinach stuffing, very indulgent. This could be a meal in itself.
BAKLAVA- at $2, the price is on par with others in the area for this dessert. But it's two or three times the size of the \"usual\" orders elsewhere, and it tastes homemade with an extra kick of some sort of seasoning/spice to make it unique, though I can't place my finger on what it is; allspice or clove. Oh, and it's proportionally accurate with a good amount of filling, rather than being mostly flaky dough, as I've had elsewhere.
GREEK SALAD- I don't like the way it's packaged and how it consists entirely of iceberg lettuce, but their feta dressing is probably my favorite salad dressing ever.

I regularly hit the drive thru here for a midday snack or to grab an easy and cheap dinner. Food is always fresh, prices are really good, quality is higher than any other place I've been with a drive-thru.

EDIT: Dropping my rating. They no longer offer the spinach pie and if you order a gyro slider, they are now served on crappy store-bought flatbread rather than the fresh mini-pitas they used to use. Service is still good, but I go here a lot less now that the quality has gone down."}
{"text":"My Dad introduced me to Gyro Time..Was I the only one who pronounced it Jyro? LOL!! One of my favorites they Gyros (yeeros) always have been my favorite love the lamb, and the sauce is amazing with the French fries.. I really haven't strayed from the menu, I like what I like,.. But I really do like the Greek Salad with Gyro meat, It's so good and comes with feta , kalamata olives peppers onions and peppercini slices.. Not to mention pita bread lunch is usually 7-9 dollars not bad.. The inside of the place will take you back to the 70s"}
{"text":"I've tried this place once before..had d Gyro with d white sauce added top of d meat. 2nd time the meat was bland, sauce on d side. Driving off d Hwy I've seen their big poster advertising their Gyro with the white sauce on top..coming from NY where I've had n enjoy Gyro sandwiches all d time the sauce is on top of meat along with all the only stuff that goes with d sandwich..Why on d side? I won't b eating at this place ever again..can't get past d bland tasting meat..sauce on d side no big deal..But..why not b authentic n add it to d sandwich the way it shld b done..I guess I of cld told them to add d sauce onto d sandwich lik it was done w/d first Gyro sandwich I ever had there. Taking it to go d 2nd time it was on d side..took a taste of d sauce-less meat..it had no flavor...really bland..it needs that sauce big time..Will I go back? Nope..looking for a new n better tasting Gyro place.."}
{"text":"At Bad Apple Tattoo getting some work done and this place comes highly recommended.

My husband went and grabbed food and was back in about 10 minutes. Fast service.

The food was amazing. The sides of cucumber sauce are huge, so try the one before ordering more. The gyro time sammich is delicious and I hope to be back!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. It may not be exactly like Greek's make it, but the food is awesome. My boyfriend said he liked this place so I decided to try it out. Now, I can not get enough. I definitely 100% recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Called in an order to Gyro time before my lunch break and they tell me it will be ready in 10 minutes. I leave to pick up the food 15 minutes later and it takes me 5 minutes to get there. I arrive and I tell them I'm here to pick up my called in order............. They hadn't even started making it and I had to wait 10 more minutes to get my food. 

Being in a rush to get back to work I take my food and hastily leave the restaurant, I get back and notice that there was absolutely no cucumber sauce, I ordered for 4 people and not a single one our orders had a cucumber sauce with it. As for my food, I ordered the grilled chicken gyro and the meat was as dry as the girls' personality of whom rung me up and the flavors were not good enough to not need a sauce. 

With a tropical smoothie and subway right next door, this place will be lucky to see another penny from any of the four of us ever again."}
{"text":"I usually go to the original location on West Charleston and Decatur .  I was on this side of town and decided to give it a shot .  The restaurant is clean and the young girl that helped me was nice .  I got a Gyro Tyme , fries , and a drink .  The meat was generous but lacked the flavor of the original location and it was dry .  The meat didn't seem like they used much of the seasoning .  They have a patio also , which is where I should have eaten since it was very cold inside and I like A/C .
     I also asked for my Military Discount which I do have Government ID for and was told they stopped doing that a month ago due to people abusing it .  That is too bad since it is Armed Forces Day today and if you only except proper ID that would eliminate a problem .  Anyway , I will continue to go to the original location since I have been going there since about 1991 when I first moved to town , but will skip this one ."}
{"text":"When I'm in the mood for a gyro this is my go to spot. The gyros are tasty. They are a decent size and very filling. They come with lots of delicious meat, onions and tomatoes on a pillowy-soft pita. The cucumber sauce comes on the side and it is good but it could use some more flavor like salt and pepper or something. I usually get a gyro and fries for around $10 and I leave full and satisfied. They have some other Mediterranean offerings like hummus, falafel, baklava and a really good Greek salad but this is by no means an authentic Greek restaurant. Think of it as Greek fast food. I ordered pickup for dinner tonight on my way home from work. They were just bagging my order when I arrived. The food was still hot and fresh when I got home and now almost 5 hours later I am still full!"}
{"text":"My favorite thing here is the gyro, but the greek salad comes in at a close second. The gyro is stuffed with delicious beef/lamb meat, tomatoes, and onions, as well as their house made cucumber sauce (tzatziki) which is very good. I get extra tzatziki on the side to dip my fries into because they are pretty flavorless. They are thick cut steak style, and I dont even think they salt them. The greek salad is made with iceberg lettuce, and has olives, tomatoes, feta, cukes, onions and pepperoncinis. Get this with the creamy feta dressing which is seriously good. Whenever I am in the mood for a gyro, this is my go-to place. Oh and they have a drive-thru."}
{"text":"I work next to Gyro so is a good place to have lunch.  The price is fair but they do have great Gyro.  I did became a big fan of there chicken tender and fries especially dip in there butter ranch dressing so good lol.  Anyways for all you who looking to enjoy a nice greek style of food come to Gyros Time.  I approve this message"}
{"text":"I had a gyro plate elsewhere and it wasn't that good. It reminded me that THIS place has the BEST gyros!!! I remember coming here since I was a little kid. This establishment has to be atleast 20 years old. Their gyros are scrumptious . It's packed with lots of meat and it comes with cucumber sauce. Never greasy or dry, just perfect.  My mouth is watering just thinking about this place. They do have a drive thru for those not wanting to dine in. I need to come grab a bite here soon!"}
{"text":"I had high expectations. Gyro Time didn't deliver.

Am I jaded for having additional fun stuff in my gyro from other places? Ordered the beef and lamb gyro it was just tomato and onions. I was kinda hoping for some kind of feta cheese, or sliced cucumber or something! The meat was terribly dry and the cucumber sauce was literally watery. 

I also ordered fries hoping it would be Greek inspired. Nope. Just straight up deep fried French fries. 

Oh well."}
{"text":"I always like going here, they are nice and always pretty fast. It's right by my house so that's a plus. I love their fries dipped in the cucumber sauce."}
{"text":"I love their Gyro time sandwiches. Bob the owner is a great friend of mine. I also like their Hummas with the dipping pita bread and cumcumbers. You have gotta go today."}
{"text":"Their Greek salad is so fresh and delicious and well priced! Also the girls who work the drive-through window in the afternoon are really nice."}
{"text":"I am NEVER coming back here. Ever! I placed an order through the drive-thru; a gyrotime sandwich with no tomatoes or onions. (I just don't like them on my sandwich.) I get to the window and it is tinted, but you can still see through the glass and I saw a girl who was, what I thought, making my sandwich. Turns out, she was UN-MAKING my sandwich. I watched as she slowly took the meat off and put it back in the warmer, then remove the tomatoes and onions, PUT THEM BACK IN THEIR BINS, WIPE OFF MY PITA AND THEN REBUILD THE SANDWICH ON THE SAME DAMN PITA! Yes, Caps are necessary for that. I was absolutely appalled!! There are people who are allergic to tomatoes or vegetarian or vegan, whatever and now not only was all of the meat contaminated with tomatoes, but those vegetables touched meat and were going to be reused on someone else's sandwich or salad. I could not believe it! It made me think that if it would have fallen on the floor, what would have stopped them from picking it up off of the ground, brushing it off again and reusing it?! I ended up taking the sandwich from the girl, being dumbfounded, and threw it away. God knows, what they would have done to my sandwich had I said something. NO NO NO. This was not okay, Gyro Time, NOT OKAY!"}
{"text":"Personally I have never been a fan of gyro meat, because everywhere I have been always cuts It way to thick- then I tried Gyro Time.
The gyro meat is to die for! It's perfectly moist and thinly cut. The thin cuts are so good on the sand which, they fill the sand which to the brim with gyro meat- making it more than enough and also giving each bite a light and layered feel. 
The staff is SO kind and always are so respectful and tentative to any needs you may have. The service is quick, and the price is very reasonable. 
My go to is the classic Gyro Time Sandwich, with a large cherry Pepsi, costing me only 10.50. 
This also comes with a huge side of tzatziki sauce, and they also have sides of hot sauce for free if you ask for them with your meal. They have a drive thru for convenience and on the go, and also accept call in- pick up orders. 
The owner (i think he is the owner- or the manager... maybe both?) is always friendly, and in a great uplifting mood. I always call in my orders and he's very nice! 
All in all, love the food, love the service, love the staff! Thanks, Gyro Time!"}
{"text":"The Gyros are good. The Greek Salad will leave you disappointed. It is just wet lettuce with a couple of slices of tomatoes, and 4 small olives. The Greek dressing was oil with seasonings and few drops of red wine vinegar. It was awful. The Pita bread taste like cold leather. The girl at the window was nice. She smiled alot kind of odd."}
{"text":"Even tho Gyro Time is pricey. It's super tasty on the meat and sauce. They put so much meat that there is no room for lettuces and tomato. I always think about buying an extra pita bread but always forget until I start eating it. 
If the price is cheaper I would definitely eat more Gyro Time. Also if they stay open later. Closing at 8pm is early but I guess the area is dead so =T sigh"}
{"text":"Small menu, dining room closes at 7:30 pm not 8 pm. Drive thru is open till 8. Food is ok, you get your Greek craving."}
{"text":"Great! If you work nearby and are looking for a quick lunch spot, this is it. They even have a drive through. The place is very dated on the inside (who really cares?). The gyro meat is incredible. I had the Greek salad with gyro meat and freshly brewed iced tea (props to them on this, most places just serve iced tea from a soda machine). The original olive oil dressing and the taziki are great with the gyro meat. I will definitely be back and I will definitely recommend it to friends."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and have only ordered the Gyro Time Sandwich. The pita is fresh, full of meat with just right amount of onions and tomato.  And the yogurt/cucumber sauce a welcome addition. 

They were constantly wiping the tables and sweeping the floor during my thirty minute lunch. 

The only issue preventing giving stars is the price. Two gyros, one fry and one large Coke was $21.47. A tad pricey for lunch. I consider that a dinner enter price"}
{"text":"I kept hearing about this place and wanted to try it. But for the price I paid for a gyro and fries wasn't worth it. The meat was dry and had little flavor. Im surprised there aren't any combos there. Overall, it's very unlikely I will go back."}
{"text":"The Gyro was delicious. And great with the cucumber sauce. Satisfying, left there happy."}
{"text":"I'm giving it four stars because it's that good, considering it's counter service.  I have been here each of the few times I've been in Las Vegas, except for the last time.

I get the Gyro Time pita sandwich, and sometimes baklava, as well as a soft drink.  It is a hearty sandwich.  It's counter service, so you can't expect them to fawn over you, but they get the job done...and fairly quickly.

This is a great place for \"grab and go\" if you are passing by or in a hurry.  Looks like most of the reviews are in the 3 to 4 star range as well."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place since it opened in 1978.  I am so sad at how there food is now.  I ordered the steak gyro and I have to say it was terrible.  The meat looked like it had already been chewed and put on the pita.  It was dry and tasteless.  I also got a bbq gyro for my husband.  The meat tasted stale and old.  I guess Bob Pistone is not the owner anymore.  If he is he needs to know that the food now stinks.  So long gyrotime will never eat there again."}
{"text":"From 7/5/16
I stopped into Gyro Time to pick up some lunch. This location is on Charleston BLVD. It's set up like a sub shop except that it is Greek sandwiches, pitas if you will. 

I ordered the Steak Gyro. It was packed full of meat, and so good- just put the cucumber sauce \"Tzatziki sauce\" that comes with it and it ties in the flavors nicely."}
{"text":"Gyro - Hero- Year-o; however the heck you want to say it = deliciousness if you grab it from here. 

I needed a quick bite to eat on my lunch break and found myself here.  I order my food (around 1pm) right away, no waiting, and then received it within 5 minutes; fantablolous! I was worried with like 4 people in front of me that I was going to be waiting.  

I got the gyro time which consisted of some thinly sliced succulent meat with a little onion and tomato and of course the 'cucumber' sauce.  I skipped on the pita bread (yes I know, how could I be so retarded) but instead emptied it all into a bowl, poured the sauce, and chomped down!  I'm not use to having fast place joints such as this serve up a good tasting gyro as it usually is charred or tasty funky- this was so not the case here, thank goodness!  If I'm in the mood for a good gyro for 7 bucks I know exactly where I will be coming back. 

Extra plus for giving a good size container of the sauce! 

I didnt give 5 stars because it wasnt the best one I have ever had, but very very good non-the-less!"}
{"text":"Needless to say I'm a connoisseur of Greek food. This place was way below par for me. I went through the drive-through to make sure I can get a quick and yummy gyro. Since its close to work, I thought I'd take a gander over and get some grub. The lady couldn't hear me through the drive through speaker. I had to pull up to the window. When I placed my order the young girl said, we don't have gyros, we have sandwiches! I was like \"WTF?\" You are called Gyro Time... for real? Another lady came to the window saying she's sorry and the other lady was wrong. I placed my order and my hummus was missing. Food was decent but the service was horrible."}
{"text":"The Gyro Sandwich #1 was pretty tasty but it would have been better if there was some kind of sauce in it.  It was pretty much just the bread with shaved meat, lots of onions and a few tomatoes.  Very dry but tasty.  I don't know if they forgot to put it in or if the dressing was a separate item."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place, I've been going to this spot for years since high school. It's situated towards the center of town, little far for us now. Whenever we're close by ill always try to make it! Food is great prices are reasonable and it's clean inside the establishment."}
{"text":"The Original Gyro Time Sandwich is delicious!  
For a fast food restaurant it's not bad.  
I was told that the grilled Chicken is not good.  I am not able to confirm if that is true for myself."}
{"text":"found this place on yelp this afternoon. I enjoyed that the place was clean and service was quick. I was in and out within 20-25 minutes! About the food... the gyro was about all i could handle, it was hot, onions were fresh and the cucumber sauce was amazing! The fries were awesome and enjoyed the self serve drink station (was kept clean, usually stations like this are unkempt and look dirty, this one did not). I expect to eat here again, once I'm not as full as i am now."}
{"text":"This is now the 2nd time we have received food that taste's like it's bad! Very poor quality! Slimy cucumbers on the salad, meat tasted old!!!! What happened? You use to be a good restaurant. Zach the manager said bring back the food we will give you another salad. Why Zach? It would be the same poor quality gross food you had us already pay for!! Never going back to this place again."}
{"text":"Nothing to see here folks. Move along. Reviewers that are crazy about this place have obviously never had a well made Gyro which \"requires\" that the sliced meat have something resembling a char. No such thing here. Meat is consistently grey and, while tasty, would be better if they turned up the fire on the cooker and let it crisp a bit. Also, there's a reason that you won't find any prices listed on the web or their carry out menu. Be prepared for sticker shock once you order. $14 for gyro, fries and a (one size only) soda. Gotta give it to them for their fries though. Hot and good."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch today and was very happy with the service I've received. I am always happy with the food at gyro time but most of my visits have been aggravating because the order was never correct in the bag but reads on the receipt like I ordered it. Well, today was different. Today, It was a perfect day. It's a different crew since the last time I was there, my order was perfect and so was the food(as usual). Please keep up the good service like I had today and outstanding food!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! It's hard to find a good gyro, but this place delivers. Their hummus plate is really good too and the pita was warm and soft. The taziki sauce was so yummy that I bought extra :-) I recommend eating here and if I'm in the area again I will be back!"}
{"text":"Solid lunch spot, fresh and easy, fast and made to order.  Classic Greek, I love the simple gyros pita or the greek salad with gyro meat.   A slight pricey $10 with drink, but its a filling meal that you will eat every bite.  I do!  4star solid reliable stuff on the run! 
Not a date place, unless you are married.  lol"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for 40 years now and their Time sandwich is still great! The only things that have changed are the prices and the size of the cucumber sauce (it actually got bigger). I go out of my way to eat here and I'm never disappointed. I'm looking forward to the next 40 years!"}
{"text":"Wow! They do NOT skip on the ingrediences! A bit high priced for fast food, but it is worth it if you want a large meal. LOTS of flavour AND quality! I have eaten here 4-5 times so far, and still have nothing negative to say."}
{"text":"Got the original gyro. Average at best. Agree with other poster, for a great gyro go to Med. Grill."}
{"text":"Best backlava I had in Vegas! Homemade- taste like home to me. Very clean place and friendly staff. We'll return for more yummy food."}
{"text":"Went yesterday because I was starving after waiting in the ER for hours.  I usually get the original gyro with the beef and lamb but I wanted to try to steak.  
Oh man, wrong move!  The steak was tough, cooked way pass well done and the seasoning tasted weird to me.  They seriously shouldn't call that steak, it was like more dog food.  
So very disappointed.  I'm gonna just stick with the original gyro next time."}
{"text":"Yum.  I love their gyros.  They sure do fill ya up.  This was my first Gyro experience years ago and I crave it all the time.  Not as authentic as other Greek places but for fast food it certainly is good!"}
{"text":"These are the best traditional Gyros I have had and I have tried them from about 6 different states. Good job guys."}
{"text":"Nastiest greek-Inspired food I have ever eaten! So many things wrong with their food. I got a greek salad and fries. You can't screw this up, but they most certainly did!!! The tomatoes were warm and soggy. There wasn't any feta and the dressing was just oil. Way too much oil (not olive oil)to the point of tasting fishy!  The lettuce was in huge chunks and brownish. The ketchup was chunky like it's never been mixed properly. Lastly, the gyro sauce aka tzakiki sauce was all sour cream. No garlic. No cucumber--just bland!!! I paid $9. 

Would not recommend anyone comes here to eat. It's a disgrace to the greek culture!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been going here for many years . Love the time sandwich bit they do not have meals any longer and price is going up. Still better than any other Gyro place in town."}
{"text":"Good for a fast health food alternative than burger king. Busy with people and got my food out fast."}
{"text":"You know the food was decent in a fast food franchise type of way. Sadly when I asked for extra tzatziki on my gyro they didn't know what that was. It's labeled as cucumber sauce on the menu and they never heard of what it's really called. If you want authentic Mediterranean this is not where you should go. If you have a craving for a fast food gyro after a few drinks then this is your place."}
{"text":"I stopped in here on the way to a friends house. I am not normally on this side of town so I'm not sure if I will ever make it here again. Ill start with the bad, I'm not sure if it was the time of day I was there or what but the other people in the little food court area look like they all just took a hit of their crack pipe. And they charge you extra for peperocini's. RUDE Now the good. I ordered the Gyro Time and it was great, a lot of meat. I wish their cucumber sauce had more flavor and it had more tomatoes in it but I was satisfied when I was done eating. If i ever came here again I want to try there hummus and spanicopitta."}
{"text":"Not bad for fast food Greek. Very friendly staff greets you with a smile and a positive attitude. gyros are decent if you're in a pinch. Will definitely do business again. The cucumber sauce is tasty niblets of goodness. Don't expect your Gyro fix to happen late at night. They close at eight."}
{"text":"Had food as a takeout order.
The food was hot and good! I got the regular gyro and it was very yummy. The pita was fresh and the meat nicely spiced. Although I ordered an extra sauce it wasn't necessary.
I also got a side order of fries which were very good! I am sure they would have been hotter if this hadn't been take out so i was very impressed.
I got a piece of baklava for dessert and this was the only fail. It had a greasy feel and didn't taste of butter but maybe margarine? I am also used to having more nut meat in the layers. I know there are different versions so maybe this is a version i have never had before, but i would not get it again. 
Overall i was very satisfied. The meal itself was very good and that is the main point!"}
{"text":"Gyro has been in town for a long time !! They price had gone up , but everything has in the world lol!! Love the Mom and papa's shops .. keep doing what you are doing !!!!"}
{"text":"The help is rude, and the food is overpriced, but it's good food so I give it five stars."}
{"text":"Finally you, the genius reviewers of Yelp, have gotten it right! I agree that Gyro Time on W Cheyenne firmly deserves a 3 - 3 1/2 star rating.

The major problem with Gyro Time is the price of the food. Each gyro, although generously proportioned, is seven bucks or more. Even a Greek God with a brain the size of a rabbit turd can realize seven plus U.S. dollars for a single gyro is outrageous!

While paying a total of eighteen bucks for two gyros and a small french fry sucks, the food deserves praise. My steak souvlaki and my significant other's gyro time sandwich were mouth-melting. That means good. And the french fries, although average, got along really well with the creamy cucumber sauce when making love. 

Since I was picking my food up to go, I can't say with conviction whether or not the service was good. I will tell you this : The girl that rang up my order used her Library voice in a completely empty restaurant when I asked her a question. I could have taken offense to the way she was acting, but I just took it out on her tip. She got nothing.

Baladie Cafe, atleast in my world, remains the best Greek food in Las Vegas. If I'm ever in the area of a Gyro Time again, I'll probably just fart and drive by. But if I ever make Bill Gates money and crave a fat, meaty gyro, I might think twice."}
{"text":"Gyro time I been eating here since 1978 at the original location on Charleston. They specialize in Mediterranean fast food. The usual items are on the menu including the traditional gyro a blend of lamb and beef  mixed with veggies served on a pita with a side of the best cucumber sauce ever. My favorite us the grilled chicken gyro. They make fresh and awesome food there restaurant is clean . There baklava is killer as well. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I started going to this place in 1984 when I was in 3rd grade. It was a reward for getting good grades. I remember getting cheeseburger gyros and thinking they were the best thing ever. Sadly the cheeseburger is long gone.  Then I left for college and made sure to hit gyro time every timer I made it home for holidays.   And now as an adult I make sure to stop in every now and then.

I now order the gyro with no onions, add feta cheese, and throw some hot sauce on it.  Delicious every time...

The guy who I think is the owner is in there  about half the time I'm there. He is a nice guy who is alway willing to have a conversation and seems to enjoy being there.... I have tried the Cheyenne location (way closer to my house) but it just isn't the same for some reason...   I am going to chalk that up to childhood memories.....

All and all this is a good place to grab lunch and take a stroll down memory lane for me....   I can't wait to take my daughter there one day when they bring back the cheeseburger gyro and she earns a trip there with her good grades...."}
{"text":"I get the urge for a gyro only once in 5 years. Today was the day. The gyro was tasty and filling. The service was efficient, the store was immaculate.  Can't ask for more."}
{"text":"I really liked the gyro. 

Overall,  for the money,  I liked it better than The Mad Greek. It was full of flavor,  and it was filling. 

Might lack a tad on the atmosphere, some old prints of Vegas on the walls,  but the good service, and the quality of that  gyro made up for that. I 'll eat here again."}
{"text":"food was delicious!! would give more stars if they had a meal option that had the gyro as well as a side of fries and a small salad. i ended up having to order a whole entire greek salad (which was pretty good) after my initial order because my gyro only had the meat (which was a lot!! and it wasn't dry or anything! super good!) and a little piece of tomato and TONS of onions. and no feta cheese :( but the cucumber dressing was also delicious!! probably won't come back because i've been to better places but if this was the only one open in vegas when i have a gyro craving i wouldn't complain either!"}
{"text":"Gyro was HUGE. Fresh onion, lettuce and tomato, bread was warm and soft. Tzatziki sauce was delicious, with just the right balance of flavors. Greek salad was very fresh, and dressing tasty. The only down side is that it is pricey ($8 for just a gyro)."}
{"text":"Best gyros in town! Going there for years and will continue to! Great customer service and employees. Best gyro and fries! Love this place."}
{"text":"There is really no place better for a gyro. Consistent for years and years, the best Greek yogurt sauce we have found."}
{"text":"I have eaten gyros around the U.S. and around the world including Greece. This was by far the WORST gyros I ever had!!!! Everything from the pita bread to the supposed meat to the horrible sauce! Why did you cut it in half? Oh yeah, to make it seem like you're getting a good portion when in fact it was so small. To add insult its more expensive than this other place I usually eat gyros at in Henderson!

The Arby's Greek Gyros is 100x better than this crap!!!!! The frozen pre-prepared gyros they sell in the grocery store tastes better than this! I went to McDonalds to get the bad taste out of my mouth from their food! 

I've been in Vegas for over 3 years and I've had it! I have had the worst of every type of food here!"}
{"text":"I've been going to the location on Charleston since the eighties. I've been going to the Cheyenne location since it opened and I have to tell you it's always great. The cashiers are always polite and the service is always great. Good job guys!"}
{"text":"I love gyros. I found the gyro here to be very good and I enjoyed it. But this just ISN'T an $8 sandwich. I can certainly afford this little caprice at any time I choose but I'm not likely to do so again. You'd think they were selling a cancer cure. I suppose they're paying a formidable rent given their Summerlin location and I likewise presume their clientele is for the most part not among society's indigent. Irrespective of the rationale for their exorbitant prices and as good as the food is it's just too damned expensive. For $8.49 you can go next door to Sabatino's and get as much pizza, pasta, salad and garlic knots that you'd care to jam down your gullet."}
{"text":"Best Gyros! The cucumber sauce is a stand out. I always make the trip here when I'm in town."}
{"text":"The  gyros are good but a bit overpriced----tastes like a typical gyro. The fries are the cheapo kind that are sold in the frozen section of a grocery store.  The service was fast and friendly.  Would come back again."}
{"text":"For a quick gyro, the original gyro time is jam packed with meat and always come with a lot of taziki sauce. I am always full afterwards and it is quite delicious! Always happy coming here!"}
{"text":"I live nearby and have literally passed by this place 1000's of times.  Today was the day to take it off the \"To Do List\".  I dropped in around 11:30 am, just before the Lunch rush.  It is located in an outdoor food court in a business mall and has a handful of tables inside with community tables outside on the patio.  It's casual fast food dining, so don't worry about dressing up.

After browsing the menu, I decided to order the Gyro Time ($6.95) and the Falafel Pocket ($5.95) with a bottle of Water....total damage with tax $15.53, ouch!  This was without any sides.

After a short wait my order was brought out by the cashier.  A small side of Hummus and Tzatziki Sauce.  I dove into the Gyro first.  It was full of Gyro Meat & Onions.  The Pita was nice and moist but the Meat was bland to me.  Despite putting the Tzatziki Sauce on it, it was still lacking flavor.  I was hungry, so I finished it.  Next up was the Falafel Pocket.  It was stuffed with Falafel, Tomatoes, Onions, and Cucumber.  I used the Hummus and remaining Tzatziki Sauce with the Falafel Pocket.  I liked it better than the Gyro.  The Falafel had a nice flavor to it and it went well with the toppings.

Overall, I was underwhelmed by the experience and flavors of their food.  For the price I paid for the food, I expected much more.

Will I return?  Nope."}
{"text":"Went there for late lunch/early dinner with the family. I got the 'Gyro TIme' sandwich which was loaded with meat, and fries. Two oldest kids got the chicken gyro, my youngest had tenders and fries, and my wife got a felafel. It sounded good, so i ordered a felafel to-go. Guy at register was super nice. He bent over backwards to accommodate us with ranch after our condiment debacle, but more on that in a minute. The place could use a remodel, as some of the reviews mentioned the outdated decor as well. Reminded me of my high school cafeteria, but I will not count the decor against them. Now for the condiment debacle. Gyro Time would have gotten a full 5 stars, but they decide to use a ketchup brand that is not Heinz. People, I am tired of trying to get my point across!!! If it ain't Heinz, it ain't sh*t!!!!!!!!!!! How people can actually use other brands and then go to sleep at night with a clear conscious is beyond me. It almost ruined my experience here, and it has ruined my experiences at some other places(check out some of my previous reviews)."}
{"text":"Got the gyro time sandwich with lamb n beef shwarma, tender tasty meat, good tzaziki sauce, haven't had a gyro in years, this one holds up to most, but one time at band camp..... Oops
Next time gonna gnosh on the falafel (is that the spelling)? 
Free drink refills, u get fries w the combo for 3bux more....

Gyro you later!

Cali"}
{"text":"Pretty good fast-food style gyros.  The place had a lot of people there when I went on a lunch hour.  My gyro was very meaty, something that other places skimp on."}
{"text":"I've been a fan since the 80's and I like the food but I must say that the prices change quite frequently. And since its ala carte a meal for one is now over $12. Still, if you would like a decent gyro, it's a good place to stop and eat."}
{"text":"I am glad I tried this place for two reasons:  1) convenient drive through, 2) hummus plate. 

The hummus is fresh and delicious and nicely assembled.  The pita bread was delicious.

Unfortunately, the grilled chicken was not good...tough, lacked flavor...did not have the flavor or taste of grilled chicken...cooking method needs improvement, as the chicken seems to have simmered on the grill instead of being grilled....need to marinate chicken longer, pat dry prior to grilling, and use enough oil to grill rather than stew.

Price a bit high and not sure if drive through guy had clean hands/nails..."}
{"text":"I eat here a lot.  My office is in a weird spot and this is one of the few restaurants close enough to grab lunch.  I think it's pretty reasonable for Greek food.  Yes, it's fast food Greek, but still very good.

I always get the Gyro Sandwich and fries.  I like my Gyro with Frank's red hot and nothing else.  Yum! Their fries are really good.  Nice and crispy.  A lot of people from my office love their greek salad with Gyro meat and Spanakopita.  For the price, you really can't go wrong with this place.  Get it to go.  The interior of this Gyro Time is creepy and uncomfortable.  Kind of like a lunchroom from the '70's."}
{"text":"For a fast food Greek place it's not too shabby.  Food is delish and generous.  We ordered the Gyros sandwich and salads, both were generous with their meat and very tasty.  The staff is friendly and there indoor and outdoor seating.

They have nontraditional Greek sauces for your enjoyment as well as the usual tsatsiki sauce (yogurt).  There is always parking."}
{"text":"Gyros are a thing of beauty. Delicious shaved meat (classic beef and lamb mixture). Warm, soft pita. Tomato and onion. Top it with tzaziki sauce and enjoy. Oh, the emense satisfaction I get from downing a good gyro from Gyro Time. The only problem is I don't like onion and always forget to ask for my gyro to be without. And let me tell you, they put a lot of onion on their gyros at Gyro Time. Everyhting else is phenominal. I think this is my favorite Gyro. The location I am reviewing today is the one on west Charleston. They are friendly and fast. And the food is amazing. The  decor is lacking though. Orange and yellow bench seats that remind me of a cafeteria are found in abundance. The walls are adorned with thrift shop photos and paintings of I suppose Greece. There is not sense of atmosphere here. It is very much a get you in get you out kind of place. That is not a serious issue.  Its just not much fun."}
{"text":"I go to the Gyro Time on Charleston/Decatur and its amazing! But W Cheyenne, not so much. The staff were super nice and polite, that's where the 2 stars come from. Very pleasant and helpful with a smile. But the food, not too hot compared to the one on Charleston. Got the steak gyro. Dry and over seasoned meat. Too bad. I wanted to love this location since it's by my house but it's not delicious like my lunch time stop on Charleston."}
{"text":"Drive thru was super quick, considering what they're having to cook for you. Maybe an extra minute more than some fast food place and totally worth it! The steak gyro is AMAZING here! They do a great job. They leave the Gyro Time on W Cheyenne in the dust!"}
{"text":"Well I lived in Michigan and there was a greek gyro shop. Fresh shaved meat and choose your additional toppings and goodies. Well when I walked into Gyro Time, I was shocked by the limited menu. The pita was fresh and the veggies (onion, tomatoes, lettuce ) was too. Good tasting gyro original would have like cheese and hot peppers to boot.
Would return."}
{"text":"I really really like this place.  I have literally  walked passed this place countless times, and entered the subway right next to it.  I asked a few people about it, and they all said the same thing.  That it is good, but they didn't like the cucumber sauce or \"white sauce\" if you will.  After checking the reviews here on yelp I decided to give it a whirl.  I'm really glad I did.

I ordered the standard Gyro time and a order of fries.  After hearing all the bad comments about the sauce I heard you can get hot sauce so i went with that.  Little did I know the white sauce comes on the side, so I ended up with both.  I am really happy I got the white sauce I think it compliments the warm meat with a cool creamy freshness.  I rally enjoyed my Gyro.  This place is a great alternative for greasy fast food if you in a hurry.  The fries are very crisp and light.  I returned again a few day's later and I was satisfied once again. Think I might have found my new favorite quick bite joint."}
{"text":"Food not that tasty. When I asked for extra cucumber sauce to add flavor. They were charging $0.97 for a small cup!!! You lost a customer."}
{"text":"Very happy with the shaved lamb rather than the typical, round and greasy pieces of meat you find at  every other place I've been to!"}
{"text":"never been in this place but the drive-thru is very fast & the service is friendly & helpgul(english-speaking). this is the only place for a good gyro in las vegas. some higher priced places try but nothing comes close to the one's @ gyrotime. good cheap eats. baklava is delicious too & cheap!!"}
{"text":"First, I went on a Monday (which was a holiday) and they were closed. Bummer b/c I was in the mood for a gyro.

I went back another day (my first time trying their food). The customer service was good and food prep time was also fine. I took my gyro and baklava home.

I found that the gyro was heavy on onions and light on other customary veggies. The meat has an ok flavor but overall the gyro wasn't worth the price. The baklava was a C+. It was mostly phyllo dough and not much of the other yummy stuff that usually fill it.

I'm not going back. I'd rather pay a slightly higher price elsewhere and get an excellent product."}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is fantastic and the employees are helpful and super nice.  They always remember what we order which is not something most places even bother with. Thumbs up all the way around."}
{"text":"Food was amazing!! But the service I got from the cashier... horrible. She made me and my friends feel uncomfortable.. made a comment that I was paying in all ones. I work at a coffee shops, but they besides the fact.. she made me feel uncomfortable and I will not be returning if she's working."}
{"text":"Great place for Gyros, lots of meat and quick drive thru service.
If I'm mistaken it seems the Gyro actually got larger?"}
{"text":"Whenever I am in the mood for a Gyro this is the spot I go to!
The only thing I really like here is the Original Gyro and their french fries.....
but I LOVE the pita bread and the fresh shaved lamb and beef with that sharp fresh onion, BEAUTIFUL!!
I have tried the sliders (which they are I guess suppose to be just a smaller version or the gyro).... no... not even close! The original has the REAL pita bread, soft fluffy... not at all the same as the sliders.
The Chicken gyro was dry and really didn't have much flavor at all. I also wasn't a fan of the Greek Salad....
Like I said stick with the Original Gyro and French Fries..... Delicious!"}
{"text":"I work in the business park here, so I come from time to time to grab lunch here. 

This place has a pretty good selection of Gyro stuff and salads and all that. Personally, though, I go for the chicken fingers with fries. They're pretty good, and even better when they're paired with their cucumber sauce. They also have other less-cool sauces: ketchup, mustard, ranch, barbecue, and buffalo. 

This place isn't super cheap, or super fast. My biggest deal with them is they're slow. It takes them about 8 minutes to get an order out to you, which is too long when you're on a short lunch break. I sometimes call my order in ahead of time, but then I usually have to wait for it a little bit, too."}
{"text":"Decent enough to get your gyro fix.  The onions always seem to be \"sharp tasting\", i.e. Not very good.  The meat is sliced very thin but they pile it on.  The sauce is sour cream based vs yogurt based."}
{"text":"Nice patio ! Good food big amount of food but .. Very small amount of dressing I know dressing cost extra but when you are already paying 10$ for a salad come on .. Would go here again it's clean fresh and good"}
{"text":"I realize a profit must be made on each customer, but putting a smidgen of \"steak\" in their gyro is unacceptable to me and I'll never return to this place again."}
{"text":"From the lot on the side, I was a little confused about where the door was; it's not the one closest to the lot, that's a computer store. You have to go around and enter from the Charleston-facing side. Also, try not to get hit by cars using the drive-thru while you're accessing that door.

Once inside, the layout and everything was pretty straightforward. Interior is nothing fancy, just plastic seats and tiled floors. Very fast-food-y, but there's nothing wrong with that. It was clean, and that counts.

The food itself was pretty good. I had the eponymous Gyro Time gyro, and it came with a side of a really tasty yogurt sauce. There was a good portion of meat and veg in the gyro itself, so even alone without fries or any other side, the meal was still filling. They offer a water cup for free.

If I were to come back I'd opt for the drive-thru experience. The gyros are OK, but there's no reason to come down and soak in the generic ambiance."}
{"text":"This place was okay if you are really desperate for a gyro but it's definitely not one of the best. There wasn't a lot of meat and the fries, despite being really expensive, were pretty plain. I wouldn't recommend this place"}
{"text":"Great customer service. Friendly staff.tasty gyro.overall good value. Thanks gyro time"}
{"text":"I was craving a Gyro so I stopped here! WARNING!!!! Please do not waste your money or time!!!!!! $8 for gross food!!!! If you are craving a Pepsi, not a bad place to stop!!! Lol... Your looking at 4.50$ for two!"}
{"text":"We found Gyro Time via the Yelp Site when looking to satisfy our craving for Gyro's while running errands last week. The stars aligned to be a great gyro sandwich with an added bonus that I found amazing.... the availability of Feta Dressing to put on the sammy. I haven't seen this condiment in Gyro establishments since I was back in Mississippi. So I was super stoked and the flavor did not disappoint.
The only con I really thought needed to be mentioned is that I would like the option to have lettuce on the gyro. I am getting the feeling from the places I have been to that the standard combo is tomato and onion but I don't care for the tomato. So, its kinda strong to have the gyro and onions alone there together. Just sayin'....
otherwise, loved the sandwich and will revisit when the urge for gyros hits again."}
{"text":"We ordered take out, I ordered the chicken gyro, it was good but nothing special, it was also not very hot so I had to warm it up. The fries were really tasty."}
{"text":"The BF and I were in the area and I have been on the oddest craving for falafel and want to find the best one in town. This was stop #1.

We shared:

Gyro Time Sandwich ($6.95)- pretty decent but I like my gyros with more than just tomatoes. 

Fafafel Sandwich ($5.95)- This is what I came to test out. Angela H. said the falafel was decent so I wanted to give this place a try.  I think it's pretty solid overall. It was crispy, but kept moist inside. Flavorwise- I still have a preferred place to get the flavor I seek. 

They gave us tzatziki yogurt and hummus on the side. Hummus worked better on the falafel. 

For $3 more you can make it a combo meal with a drink and a choice of side: fries, grilled vegetables or spinach pie. The BF and I both chose the spanakopita and were surprised by the size. I was expecting a small triangle, but they gave us a generous slice and it was pretty tasty. 

We had a bit of room to try the baklava ($1.50) and it was pretty good. Not overly buttery or too sweet. 

I think if you're in the area, it's not a bad stop for lunch."}
{"text":"The food is really fresh and delicious.  The hummus is second to almost none.  I love how the hummus appetizer comes with both pita and fresh vegetables.  Normally I get a little weirded out by vegetables at a seemingly fast food oriented restaurant but man the food is good, fresh, AND fast.  If you are in the area and want something quick but not a greasy burger this is the place!
    Not a sit down restaurant and the only real down side is that it's not a 5 star dinning room.  The store however does not need that and does not go for that.  This place is awesome."}
{"text":"I've been here serveral times and my go-to's are The Gyro Time sandwich or the Gyro Salad. 

The Gyro Time sandwich here is filled with more meat compared to other places and for $7.50! Great deal for a Gyro! Even my dad who loves extra extra extra meat on his gyro was fully satisfied with the amount of meat they add. 

Here's a list of the things I appreciate about this place: 

I love that the sauce automatically comes on the side for the sandwich and salad. 

Free refills on soft drinks! 

It's never busy, but they have been in business since the 70's. So you know they'll be here for the long haul! 

I've been here several times and I always get excellent service. Ordered a to-go plate before we left and they walked it up to our table!

Baklava is okay 3.5/5 but what I like about it is that it's less sweet than other restaurants, great for those watching their sugar.

There is another Gyro Time closer to home, but the quality and service is better here than the Eastern location. 

FYI: They have a drive thru that closes 8pm. Dine in closes at 7:30pm."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place every Wednesday for the past 4-5 weeks and have ordered the same meal and received the same military discount every week except today. Granted, their food is good and comes out in a timely manner, their customer service today sucked and I will never go back! When I ordered my food and showed my military card Zack told me since I'm NOT active duty military, my 25 years of active duty and now retired service means nothing to their company and only ACTIVE duty military get a discount. Blew my mind that he said it with such ease and disrespect that I will no longer give then my business and recommend all veterans due the same."}
{"text":"I'm in craving mode for a  Gyro and this is my first time here and I must say it was a 10 for me in taste service we went through the drive-thru and girl was really nice about my pickiness and indecisive in what to get but I got the grilled chicken gyro it was stuffed with chicken lettuce tomato and cucumber and no nothing cheap on size and filling oh and if you like cucumber dill hands down this was the best I ever had."}
{"text":"I was a little worried when I saw it was a chain, almost left...but it was good. A nice, big, fat gyros with plenty of stuff, at a decent price. Good stuff, would repeat."}
{"text":"This place hit the spot on a hot sunny day. Our group didn't want something greasy and this was the first place we found on the gps.

Upon arrival, the place looked new! Maybe it was clean, but it was a surprise. Ordered the number one and the number 3 because i was hungry. The meat on both was great! Good flavor. I love how the onions were spicy too.

My cons for this place:
The dressing. It tasted like sour cream, but i wished it tasted like traditional yogurt.
The paper wrapping: my gyro fell apart so easily and i wished they wrapped it completely. They had a small sleeve at one end.
Price: 15 bucks for 2 gyros, no sides and no drink.

Overall, good food."}
{"text":"I enjoy this place a lot.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because their menu is somewhat limited, but great nonetheless.  I usually go for the falafel sandwich, it's amazing and I love their fries. The customer service and cleanliness are awesome as well.  Haven't had a bad experience with this place yet!  Try the W. Charleston and Easter locations as well, they're both great."}
{"text":"Great Gyros. The ratio of meat to veggies and pita is perfect.  Nicely spiced with a great Tzatziki Sauce.  Order the fries well done and you could not ask for more.  Enjoy sitting outside during the nice weather times of year.  Sits in a \"food court\" plaza where every location is a restaurant so it is nice as everyone can get what they want."}
{"text":"I went there for the first time yesterday, and ordered a Greek salad with both the olive oil and the creamy feta dressing. I asked for grilled steak on top. The food was ready in less than 10 min which was great. I'd really been in the mood for some amazing Greek salad.... But I'll be honest: it wasn't that great. There didn't seem to be much meat on the salad, and I didn't particularly care for the OO dressing, so I was glad I got a different one to try. This salad was quite bland, and didn't seem authentic. However, the meat was tasty. Grilled nicely and flavorful, just sparse. The pita bread was good, so I can say that it wasn't a complete fail. I just won't return, or if I do, I won't be getting another Greek salad."}
{"text":"After having eaten here multiple times over the past three years and ordering the same thing (Original Time), I decided to give the Grilled Chicken Gyro a try. Although no nutritional info was available, it seemed like a healthier option.

The chicken, I felt, was on the drier side but not bad. Was seasoned well with pepper and some salt. But overall, not that flavorful so I added the house bbq sauce and tzakaki. The pita bread was chewy and fresh.  Wasn't a big fan of the shredded iceberg lettuce. 

I've found the workers to be overall friendly and helpful.

Unfortunately, my issue with Gyro Time is the price. $10.50 for a pita with a small to moderate amount of meat and a soda is a bit much in my book.

Overall, meh...Gyro Time is ok but nothing special."}
{"text":"Always wanted to just comeback this place Becuase
Of their Greece exterior design building which made it look attractive. This place is located on charleston and buffalo I live about Two minutes always from here. I ordered the lemon pepper chicken gyro. A little bit disappointed about the flavoring of the lemon pepper wasn't that strong. Everything else is good the sauce balance we'll win the gyro as well. I would come back again just to give it a shot."}
{"text":"I just didn't think there was anything special about the food. There's too many Greek or Mediterranean restaurants that have much better food."}
{"text":"The food I got was horrible from here. The Gyro I was almost all meat. No lettuce, only half a slice of tomato and 4 pitiful strings of onion. Nothing like the description, although the meat & pita bread was good. The spinakopita tasted like it had been sitting under a warmer for weeks. What a huge disappointment and waste of money. I should've driven the extra 10 mins in the other direction to Gyro Cafe."}
{"text":"This place doesn't look like much on the inside but the food is consistent delicious.  Also love the yogurt sauce on the side!"}
{"text":"Gyro Time! 

I simply adore this place and am lucky as I live only 10 minutes away so I can fulfill myself when needed as often as needed, mmmmmmm yes!

Simplicity is key, fresh and generous Gyro meat, fresh pita, and the most delicious creamy cucumber sauce your mouth will have the chance to savor. It all blends so well together. The meat is generous, quarter pound of beef and lamb.

They also have a barbeque sauce gyro that rocks.

Basically I have sampled a lot of their menu, everything is fresh and delish.

I am just hooked on the plain simple perfect Gyro they have been granting us in their 30 years in business! 

Gyro Time Gyros give me the mouth orgasm I need to get on with my day! Plain and simple.

Sock it to me Gyro Time! Love you guys and your staff is awesome!"}
{"text":"\"Ijana\" is the name on the ticket.  Give credit to servers who deliver so much enthusiasm.  How does she manage to be so cheerful?  I put a buck in the tip bucket right after an elderly gentlemen dropped in 3-4 well-deserved dollars.

These are very reliable gyros.  I don't say \"hero.\"  I know it's wrong but I like \"gyro.\"  That makes me a boor.  OK."}
{"text":"I started going to Gyro Time in the mid 80s when I was in elementary school and of all the other restaurants where I have gotten a gyro are never as good as Gyro Time.  The pita is always fresh and they load it up with plenty of thinly sliced meat.  Was glad when they opened one on Cheyenne since it is near where I work."}
