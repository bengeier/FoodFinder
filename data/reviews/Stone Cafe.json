{"text":"I went Stone Cafe yesterday night. They have a good deal on sizzling platter and huge of selection. We ordered 3 different Iced Snow Flake ( see my photo). That's so nice and yummy!! They also have some other desserts and special drinks ..... chesse cake, pudding, pancake ..... Would try next time !!"}
{"text":"Not good Not Bad. 

Every HK style caf√© I go to, I always order Beef Brisket Rice Noodle  in Soup and Milk tea.  

Noodles were broken in pieces. Have had better ones else where.

They do have some desserts, might give that a try one last time before I give up on this place."}
{"text":"I am from New York and my Chinese boyfriend is Canadian.  I am up for some little afternoon snack and sweet drinks and here we are because of the interesting name.

Err.. Nope, there is no \"stone\".  We ended up having Mango Pancake and Mango mountain drinks,  they were AMAZING with capital letters!  I also tried to order some Taiwanese snow flake because the pictures looked so delicious.  Sadly, the boss told me the machine is out of service.

The staff is very friendly but the boss took it to extra level.  Place is so clean, the cappucino is delcious and we ended up ordering more and more.

Did I mention free WiFi?  4 stars and we will come back!"}

I got the chicken steak in gravy on the sizzling platter with rice. I was disappointed there was no veggie or potatoes on the sizzling plate like most places.  The chicken was pretty good but I had better elsewhere.  We also got the curry brisket with rice which wasn't any good as it wasn't spicy and tasted a little watered down.  Had some cream soup which was okay and some dessert I don't even know what it was called but it wasn't any good (came with my order).  Milk tea was nothing to rave about but place is decent price for the portion you are getting."}

Nope. No one came to become stoned.
Nope. I was not in a state of intoxication.
Nope. This cafe doesn't offer substances.

Pass the entry-way, a staff kindly greets us.  GREETS us, what?!  
Standard HK cafe methodology is for them to avoid eye contact.

We get seated quickly and the staff asked another to wipe the table.
WIPE the table?! The table was spotless already and Menus arrive.

We order and as usual Jennifer K harasses the guy asking questions.
The guy asked us if we want the Comp Drinks to be served NOW or LATER.
NOW or LATER?!  Other cafes dump it off right away no matter what you say.

Seaweed Soup...  Looks similar to Home-style Soup my mom makes.
There was Thousand year-old Egg my mom never puts in the soup.
The Seaweed wasn't too overdosed that it makes you choke constantly.
Not that I'm complaining my mom makes bad soup to make me choke.

Food arrives, the staff tells us we should use small BOWLS to share.
BOWLS to share?!  We didn't ask.  Advises us we should try both dishes.

A staff walks by and tells me to be CAREFUL not to touch Stone Bowl.
CAREFUL?!  A cafe staff that cares about my wellbeing.  News to me.

Stone Cafe must be HIGH on something.
Freaks me out slightly to see such things.
If the food they serve can kick it up a notch...
I wouldn't mind being STONED more often.  3.5'd"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner and tried their hot pot stone pot set for two. We picked the spicy chicken stone pot and it came with a plate with vegetables,tofu, cuttlefish balls, beef balls, vermicelli and dry bean sheet. The spicy chicken was HOT, a bit too spicy for my taste but it made everything that went into the pot flavourful. This was enough for 3 people. I had ordered the mango sago dessert with pomelo to cool me down. It was very good! Would come again to try the other desserts. I would visit again, but I might stick to their stone grill dishes."}
{"text":"Saw a few instagram and yelp posts concerning this new HK Style cafe so wanted to try it out since it was closeby.

Prices are pretty typical of HK Style Cafe but at their price point you get a soup as opposed to other places you wouldn't such as Phoenix.

Most of the baked items come in a Korean style hotpot bowl so it keeps the food quite hot which is good on these cold winters.

We got spaghetti and Portuguese chicken rice, both were pretty good but nothing out of this world. 

This is a great place if you want to get a seat and food quickly but not anything special over any other HK Style cafe."}

I don't usually come to this plaza often but after reading Jennifer K. review on this new restaurant. I decided to come and give it a try.

Soft opening i believe. Clean and simple are the 2 key words to describe this place. 
Pricing is average and reasonable. I like the fact where they have the option to add $1 for additional items to add on. Thats quite a nice idea.

Lunch Specials/Afternoon Tea Specials from reasonable prices. under $6/per item

Free Wifi is posted and the waitress actually told me there is wifi and there is the password. Good service!

10% grand opening (not sure till when)"}

Stone Cafe is a new Hong Kong Style Cafe replacing New Broadway which used to be Broadway. 

The interior is clean and simple. The staff is super friendly and even fills up my tea cup! Service is excellent compare to others HK Cafe I been to. The waiters are from previous New Broadway..

Menu has a choice of HK Cafe staples and of course specials any time when one drops by for a quick meal.

Lunch Specials from $5.50/Afternoon Tea Specials from $3.50/All Day Specials from $4.99.. And of course they do have their house special Hot Stone Pot rice.

Cuttlefish Balls/Seaweed Noodle Soup with drink ($4.99) plus a side order of Veggie ($1.00) is definitely A-OK. Maybe a little on the smaller size portion wise but great as a light and healthy snack.

Free Wifi just ask for the password. And in my case, the friendly waiter just told me even before I asked!

10% Grand Opening Special. I guess I will be back for some cheap eats!"}
