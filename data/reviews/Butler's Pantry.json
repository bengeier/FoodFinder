{"text":"Pleasant staff, decent food and fair prices, yet what might have been a perfect brunch on a warm summer Sunday today  was considerably diminished by many wasps swarming the patio tables.  I was told the owners refuses to use wasp traps or even one of the effective fake wasp gadgets that keeps wasps away. It's not even an expensive fix to protect diners so what's going on here?  It's a matter of time before someone gets stung and sues for damages.  Too bad, but shows a lack of care for customers!!  I down rated the place by two stars for that reason."}
{"text":"This is a no-frills casual spot that offers many interesting entrees (most are $10 or less)   - most come with a hearty salad with amazing homemade dressing which is like a sweet/spicy french dressing.   The jambalaya is my fav and have been ordering it for over 20 years - highly recommend!     They always have a great selection of cakes -I think Dufflet and some local bakers - never been disappointed with the quality of their cakes/pies (always fresh).  Good brunch spot on weekends - excellent french toast (baked, so very light), real maple syrup, topped with real whipped cream and fresh fruit.  Coffee is decent but won't over impress - but always fresh.   Service can be slow at times as there is only ever one server but I think it's worth it (hence the 4 stars)."}
{"text":"I went here last night for mother's day and was very disappointed. I ordered the bulgogi and it was very salty. My daughter ordered the mac and cheese and we found a hair in her dish, we told the server, who just shrugged her shoulders and said \"sorry\". I will not be going back, the food is over priced for what you get. We tried to get reservations at Cafe Polonez, but they were all booked. Too bad...."}
{"text":"I have tried every single item on their daily menu -because I'm in denial since they have nice touches to the food, a cozy sitting area and friendly service-.  The main dishes, salad and soup are average. Their morrocon, egyptian, indian and greek dishes were average or at times below average.  Their perogies -but not enough to go back to them- and cakes are great but they I go for the chocolateria next door so they lose on that account"}
{"text":"I don't understand how this restaurant is open, especially when surrounded by real restaurants. It's a lot cheaper to eat out of the freezer isle at No Frills, which is where most of the food comes from before hitting your table via the microwave. The one star I've given this place is for the friendly, but completely ineffective staff.  My salmon eggs benny was full of water, with broken hollandaise, a cold English muffin, and served with three frozen food isle \"potato\" pucks. My husband had the crab meat sandwich..... See garlic bread drowned in mayo and watery pre frozen pollock.  The perogies were pleasant.... But for $6 I'd like more than 4.  It's too expensive to be this bad. You could get better food at Nirvana or Sneaky Dees for 1/4 of the price. Never again."}
{"text":"Cheap, fast and delicious! I went to Butler's Pantry for brunch with a group of nearly 40 which the staff handled without a hitch! Major kudos to them for being cheerful while doing it. Recently I've gone with server recommendations and I'm a happier man for doing it. The Chicken Bastilla Pie (see photo, por favor) was a generous, deep slice of tender, black-pepper infused, delicious chicken filling in a flaky crust, served with a side salad. It's the kind of chicken you get after boiling it in a pressure cooker with spices and garlic to the point that it falls off the bone.  Butler's Pantry bills itself as a place that has tastes from around the world on its menu, so you'll see Indian (Biryani, Veggie Bhaji) and Greek (Moussaka) entrees being served alongside the Eggs Hollandaise brunch items. My friend had the Khowsway (egg noodles with a coconut milk curry, vegetables and chicken) and indicated it had just the right amount of spicy bite to it. Great! Because that was the other thing the waiter recommended..."}
{"text":"I would have ranked Butler's Pantry 2-star, but we had an exceptional waitress, so a square 3 it is.  As mentioned, this is a chill place with potentially a lot going for it. But the food is just SO mediocre, it's painful. My boyfriend ordered the jambalaya (which he enjoyed enough), and myself, the khowsway. I was expecting a much more flavourful, saucy dish than what I received.   After poking the mess of noodles around a bit, I must have looked very mournful, because our waitress approached and asked, 'Do you need more sauce?'  'Why, yes! Please!' 'I TOLD the kitchen guy he needs to stop being so stingy with the sauce!'  {Needless to say, she was tipped well.} More sauce, and the dish was vastly improved, but still not fantastic. I don't believe that a patron should NEED sauce supplemented... the dish ought to come out properly sauced, seasoned, etc. Not the waitress' fault though, and kudos to her."}
{"text":"I have eaten here before, which is why I suggested to my meat-loving brother that this would be a great place to eat on a quiet Sunday evening.    We were both ravenous and while we both live in the area and have eaten at the Victory Cafe many times, thought that trying something different on Markham Street would be a good idea.  It was a Sunday night, and everything was quiet so we knew it would be a mostly empty restaurant.  Bad idea.  The table and menus were sticky.  There were only four other tables with two or three people sitting at them, yet it took 40 minutes for our food to arrive!  The most irritating thing about that was that two of the other groups had arrived after us and ordered their food after we did!  When I asked the waitress why we were waiting so long for our appetizers, she seemed irritated.  We got the samosa appetizer that tasted exactly like a mildly spicy samosa appetizer.  I ordered the shell pasta that had a spicy sauce, but tasted fairly basic.  The pasta was really dry and mostly stuck together.  My brother had one of their signature dishes that looked delicious from the description.  It ended up looking like noddles sitting in a nice sauce, but when he ate the noodles, the sauce completely slid off and he was left with watery noodles.  I was happy that it was reasonably priced because I would never pay a lot for a meal like that.  It was one of the worst restaurant experiences I have had in a long time, and I have no intentions of returning.  The waitress saw that we were unhappy and didn't apologize for the terrible service.    I agree with some of the other reviews.  It is chill and does have potential, but that's not going to get people to return.  Great street, great neighbourhood, terrible experience."}
{"text":"Had brunch menu and some main menus with friends. Well... Staffs are very very friendly and nice and atmosphere of the store is good. For the brunch menu, it was just normal not bad but not so good. But the house made scorn was sooo delicious!! I will go again just for scorn. Not for brunch."}
{"text":"went here last night on a whim and had a rather lovely time.  Granted, my company might have had something to do with it but all in all this was a cute little place that I would try again.  At first I struggled with the menu because it's all over the place.  I always worry that a restaurant might be spreading themselves too thin when it's so varied.   In any case, we finally decided on the Khosway and the Chicken Pie (not the Bastilla).  The Khosway was a green lentil and rice dish with a nicely spiced tomato sauce.  It wasn't 'out of this world' but it was hearty and comforting and spiced in a nicely understated way.     The portion could have been halved and still been enough.  As it was I took half home and am intending on stuffing a red pepper with it and eating it for dinner tonight.   Two meals for the price of one!    The chicken pie had a nice crust on it and was filled to bursting with shredded chicken and vegetables.  It wasn't particularly saucy but it definitely wasn't dry either.  Again, a nice comforting meal with some to take home.    Both mains were served with a fairly decent green salad - nothing fancy, but the dressing was quite nice.    Our server was so likeable I am willing to forgive the slow service.    She stole our hearts when she said she was going to bring us 'something extra fancy' to keep our bottle of wine cool and returned with a beer pitcher and a cup of ice!   Had that been brought in all seriousness it might have dampened the mood but it worked and gave us a pretty good laugh to boot!   and since you've read this far, I'm going to let you in on the best part of the meal :  The perogies.    We almost missed them because we didn't realize that the menu was double sided.  Three good sized perogies,  handmade by 'a little old Ukranian lady' stuffed with potato and spinach served with a little dab of sour cream and some caramelized onions.  ($5),   Honestly, I would go back and make a meal of just those...."}
{"text":"The first time I came here with 2 others for tues dinner and I loved everything. The atmosphere was fantastic, very clean and welcoming. The perogies were pretty good. Baba ganouche super tasty. Best salad dressing ever invented. Shell pasta dish nice and spicy. Cricket club massive. The server was knowledgeable and friendly. On tap organic delicious. I had 1/3 pitcher, 2/3 appetizers, and my own sandwich for twenty bucks after tax and tip.  The second time, also tues dinner with one other, and it was really lacking. Considering the restaurant was fairly empty, we had to wait 20 minutes before a server came over. She was just at the front polishing glasses, I figured there must be another server on break, but 15 minutes pass and the polisher lady finally put the rag down and came over. She was really nice, but totally unapologetic. We saw the couple of other tables there glancing over at her often too waiting for their bill. A bit more training of timing and priorities might be a good idea.  Also we were the only new table in, everyone else cleared out shortly after we were served and she finally made the rounds. So why did our 2 person non-modified meal take an additional 40 minutes to make.   So, my conclusion, it's hit or miss with this place. Worth it if you're in the area, not worth a special trip though."}
{"text":"This place will be my new brunch spot! Great menu that infuses different cuisines into your breakfast and lunch favourites. Grab a seat near the window, enjoy your coffee of choice and get hungry. My choice the governor sandwich (back bacon, melted Cheese, artisan bread smeared with hot mustard paired with a creamy split lentil soup) can't wait to come back and try something else."}
{"text":"We walked by there today and gave it a try.  it was really awesome from beginning to end.  especially the homemade scone...mmm. the salmon benedict...perfect.. si was the club sandwich.  service was incredibly friendly.... we will be back there for sure"}
{"text":"The Toronto Lover system: 5 stars = Must visit! 4 stars = Really good. I take my friends here. 3 stars = Somewhat worth it... if you have nowhere better to go. 2 stars = Below average. Attend only when necessary. 1 star = Do not visit!   The Butler's Pantry is a cafe that happens to serve food. It's a great location on Roncesvalles to sit and have a chat with a friend or read a book. I wouldn't recommend the food, though. I had the grilled veggie wrap twice, and each time it was a completely taste and experience. That worries me.  So: coffee and snacks, yes. Meal, no.  2 stars"}
{"text":"My first time there with a party of 3 we just went for hot drinks on a cold day. My hot cocoa came lukewarm, but I didn't feel like making a big deal of it. Halfway through someone else mentioned his coffee came lukewarm and the 3rd said her coffee was as well. Very disappointing. One star.  This weekend we walked down Roncy looking for a late lunch. Most places were closed by 3 pm, so we stopped into Butler's as a last choice option. This time the cappuccino came piping hot. I got the egyptian dish, which was both tasty and very filling. Partner got the Jambalaya, which he thought was just ok. We both agreed the house dressing was fantastic. This was a 3 star experience.   Averaging the 2 experiences together would only be 2 stars, but the 2nd time was good enough to make us think we'd still give it another try."}
{"text":"The Butler's Pantry has a certain quaint charm to it.  I actually enjoy going to the Roncesvalles location either alone for a quiet lunch or bringing my Mom or a friend along. The food is hearty and tasty, not to mention diverse and not too pricey either. My absolute favourite dish is the Marocain chicken bastilla pie.  Yumyum!"}
{"text":"Really disappointing brunch. I ordered the eggs benedict and my boyfriend ordered an omelette. The eggs benedict came out hard poached which is not the standard for eggs benedict. They should be soft poached unless they are ordered hard poached. The hollandaise sauce wasn't very good either. My boyfriend's omelette also looked unappealing. It looked like the eggs were scrambled and fried in the pan first before adding any of the ingredients.  All in all, it was a disappointing brunch. I'll be sticking to the White Brick Kitchen in the future."}
{"text":"Came here as a backup plan when our original lunch spot didn't pan out.  The place itself is a tad unassuming and the decor, to be honest, isn't all too memorable, a pretty basic set up... nothing too swanky.   We sat in the back area and the \"hostess\", who also works the till and doubles as the server, gave the two of us at a four seater table which was nice. I hate being forced to sit at a cramped two-seater when a restaurant clearly isn't busy.  The menu had great selections for meateaters, vegetarian and vegans alike. There is a heavy east Indian influence on the choices and flavours of the meals.  They also offer a brunch menu that runs until 2pm on weekdays and 4pm on weekends. Based on what I ordered off of it brunch is not their specialty, however.  Don't get the eggs benny. The yolks were cooked as solid as a hard boiled egg and the hollandaise sauce had a sour after taste.  Their entrees off of the regular menu however, one of which my friend ordered, are delicious. She got the spinach nut casserole and it was amazing... obviously I stole a bite (maybe two). Based on that bite I would definitely go back to try some other entree dishes.  The service was efficient, the server-slash-hostess was friendly and their salad dressing was badass good. It was a bit inconvenient that thy only accept cash or credit and no debit. With no forewarning or little signage I didn't find this out until after we ate, so have money on hand if you go.  If I had to get picky I guess I would say I didn't need to see their less than fancy kitchen area through swing doors that were kept open and the back door that was propped open to the alleyway and garbage bins beyond that... but hey, I personally didn't care much about it.  If you aren't keen in the flavours often found in Indian foods this place may not be the spot for your tummy but otherwise I recommend giving it a gander."}
{"text":"Came here last year but I think it has changed hands since. Its not as cosy as it was but the food was actually great. I had the Jambalaya (PIC attached) which had some nice heat and great flavour. Food arrived promptly and service was friendly and helpful. Shame its lost its old cosy feel but recommended in the food at least."}
{"text":"I haven't been in here for years, but whenever I go past it I can't help noticing what awful, awful lighting they have. The low-quality LED pot lights give this place a depressing, cold atmosphere. It may seem unimportant, but it's not: the lighting changes the look of the food, and that affects how we experience it."}
{"text":"cons: -slow -bland -overcooked -poached eggs (you're supposed to add a bit of vinegar to the water, not poach in vinegar!!)  pros: -none, not even the price.  i would have gladly paid $20 to cook my own brunch instead of paying $20 for the worst eggs benedict ever - and waiting 45 minutes for it!!  if you're a student with an unrefined palette, this may be a good place if everywhere else in town has a lineup and it's really cold and rainy out"}
{"text":"Excellent service! Great, delicious food hearty and wonderful for Autumn. Food came quickly and staff was open and welcoming to kids. We recommend: Any salad as the house dressing is divine, Bastille Pie, Beef Burgundy."}
{"text":"This place is a real inspiration.  Now even I feel I could open a restaurant.  The food is ok actually, with a good mix of things for all taste buds.  And quick... don't tell me you ever had quicker.  Seriously, you order... 2 minutes later... you hear a \"beeep\" then you know they are taking the dish out of the 'other 'ucking microwave and onto your plate.  Thankfully the salads aren't frozen and the smoothie special makes up for it... a little.  Laugh or cry... the choice is yours."}
{"text":"The casual, cozy atmosphere and the longevity of this place in the neighbourhood drew us in but the food was unimpressive. A worse discovery perhaps was that they microwave the food.   We sat in the back section and while we waited for our wine to be served I observed the cook in the kitchen. As she plated food I noticed her taking the dishes out of the microwave.  I mentioned to the waitress what I'd seen and asked if our food would be microwaved. She explained it's how the kitchen staff reheats the food and that yes, our soup and our main would be reheated by microwave. Since I'm a firm believer that microwaves don't belong in food and vice versa, I asked if the kitchen would heat our food by stove-top or oven and after checking in with the cooks she said they would but that it would slow down our service. We were ok with the compromise and we waited.   The food wasn't good - the soup tasted of salty, powdered soup base, the fishcakes were plainly fishy, and our main, the Kosharee, tasted like bland lentils and rice dowsed in tomato paste.     This meal was disappointing and I won't frequent the Butler's Pantry again."}
{"text":"The food here is decent.  It's more like ethnic-fusion comfort food than anything elaborate.    I really like the zucchini pancakes.  Last time I was there I had the Bulgogi dish.  The sauce on the beef was WAY too sweet for one sitting, however it was good as leftovers blended in with lots of extra rice and veggies to dilute the sauce.   It's a very chill place so service might be a bit slow at times."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place - it's our home cooking solution!  We find ourselves going here at least 1x every two weeks.  The salads are amazing! And the menu is mom-made fusion.  I've enjoyed everything I've tried!"}
{"text":"Food was decent. The service was decent.  Nothing really special compared to all the hype I'd heard about the place."}
{"text":"Decent-ish brunch with no lines. Big booths and attentive staff. Nothing special. I had a pancake. Go here if you don't want to wait. Easy parking on the weekend - free until 1pm."}
{"text":"I usually enjoy getting the vegetable and chicken pie... you can never go wrong with that. I also love the dressing that comes with their salads.   I tried my friend's bulgogi, but we found it to be way too sweet. You'd be better off going for the real thing at the surrounding Korean restaurants."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite places in the city to eat. It's never loud, the prices are totally reasonable, the food is a pretty standard Toronto grub selection (with veg & vegan options), & the atmosphere is decent, especially in a window booth. The staff are really friendly, & they don't care if I hang out & read for a while.    Fair warning, I think they have a chef make their food in the morning, & then they heat it up in the microwave when you order. I don't mind it being heated up on order, but I do mind the microwave use -- you can tell that it's not heated in an oven, especially when you've ordered something with cheese. That's the only reason I'm not giving it five stars."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for at least 8 years, and the food used to be flavourful and fresh and it was one of my go-to restaurants in the neighbourhood. After the last two times I will never be coming here again.   The \"caesar\" salad I ordered was just a very small handful of the inner bottom white romaine stems with two olives and one slice of tomato. It used to be a large helping of fresh romaine, and actually had croutons and parmesan. Who doesn't put croutons and cheese on caesar salad? This would be bad by itself, but I had to wait 20 additional minutes for the salad alone after they messed up my order and gave me the house salad, after already waiting 15 minutes longer than the original 20 minute time I was told after calling in an order for takeout.  The rice with the bulgogi was at least half the size of previous portions and I literally had to use a steak knife to cut it up and eat it because it was clearly just very stale microwaved rice.  As well, they used to put lamb in their moussaka but the last time I ordered it the lamb was mysteriously missing.  Do NOT order takeout or delivery from this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Went here for brunch with friends.  I enjoyed my food fine, and it was easy to get a table which is always nice.  Bizarrely, almost all of our dishes were chipped, cracked, etc.  Kind of discouraging - if they're so cheap that they'll serve you food on plates with a big chip out of the side on literally every dish, makes you wonder about the level of care they take in preparing the food."}
{"text":"Butler's Pantry? More like Costco's freezer."}
{"text":"Went there for brunch; waitress said their Montreal smoked meat was from Montreal and the dish itself is very large, but we couldn't tell as there were very little of it on the plate.  I regret ordering what their waitress recommended.  Definitely not worth the value."}
{"text":"A great little spot in Mirvish village. The menu is pretty simple - one side is brunch, apps and sandwiches while the other is their mains. One thing to watch out for is that the \"SPICY\" symbol (Mmmmm) looks a lot like the \"VEGAN\" symbol (barf) so don't be fooled into a dud meal. My GF had the jumbalaya and I had the Biryani. This was her second time through and she said that the jumbalaya was a bit dull compared to her last time. The sauce was a bland out-of-the-jar tomato sauce and while the veggies and chicken were great, they couldn't lift the dish to its full potential. The Biryani was pretty awesome / I was really hungry. Great presentation for a delicious meal. I had tables on either side looking wistfully when the dish arrived. The curry rice is in a mound with a delicious sauce on top. Fresh cucumber and tomato bits are scattered around the edges, giving this warm and hearty dish a bright and light burst of flavor.   Two big dishes (we couldn't finish everything) and a bottle of white wine came to a grand total of $55 with a generous tip  to our fantastic waitress. All in all a great experience. So why only 3 stars? Because while this place was totally great, it didn't do anything to knock my socks off. If you wanted a certain ethnicity of dish, there was typically only one choice, and the drinks list was pretty meager. We had an awesome night and will likely go back, but only because it's a small, stable and safe menu. there was none of the excitement that would propel a place like this to a 4 or 5 star review."}
{"text":"A special lady friend and I came here for dinner once. On *my* recommendation. I'd been here many years prior and it was good. So, off we went.  On myyyyy recommendation.  I was really hungry and wanted something filling. I ordered biryani.   Serves me right for ordering an Indian dish..........in a NON-INDIAN RESTAURANT.  I got a small, pathetic bowl of what was mostly...rice.  Flavourless rice.  For $12.  It had about 5 very pathetically small pieces of beef. I counted that shit. And some veg, but not much.  I was mad. I was really hungry, and this was sad. I sent it back.  I waited around 20 minutes for my meal to come back. I thought they were making me a fresh meal, which I was told they were. When it came back, I was told they just reheated it and added some more beef.  ...  MAYBE 7 - 8 PIECES, TOPS. Was someone having a bad day? Did the chef need to take some Advil? Was it too much to ask for a proper BEEF STEW with my RICE?  \"It's mostly a rice dish\".  That's what the waiter said.   IT'S MOSTLY A RICE DISH FOR 12 FUCKING DOLLARS?  He offered dessert. We passed. I kind of felt bad for him, but not really. He heavily discounted my meal. It didn't save their reputation or quality of food for me. I will never return."}
{"text":"whilst strolling/shopping along Roncesvalles one sunday afternoon (discovering half the stores in Roncy are closed sundays :( ) and getting a bit peckish, my friend and i initially brushed off this place upon seeing the menu. it flashed ASIAN FUSION and marked the restaurant as CONFUSED: in an instant glance there was Indian, Korean, Morrocan, Greek, Cajun...the list goes on.   in any case, we saw there was still a few customers inside and figured we'd give it a shot (+points for lots of veggie options).  sandwich costs are comparable to that of a cafe's, but I was not impressed with my crab sandwich. THE DUCHESS is described as \"Shredded crab salad with old white cheddar served on toasted rye bread\". it fails to mention that it was imitation crab - which I would eat normally anyways, but I ordered with the craving for real crab meat. no wonder the sandwich was so cheap ($5.25). come to think of it, I don't recall tasting cheese either..    it comes with a slice of pickle and measly slice of raw carrot.  ..at least the bread was well toasted.  a lady at the next table ordered a slice of chocolate cake and the serving was massive. perhaps there's hope for this joint but, with the variety of other options in this area, it's unlikely i'll be back."}
{"text":"As an update: I received an apology and explanation for the quality of my meal from someone at the Butler's Pantry. Truth be told, the menu clearly states that hash browns are served with their eggs benedict as opposed to home fries, as I mistakenly stated.  Though I certainly appreciate what I believe is honest concern about my experience as a customer from the management, the fact remains that NO cook worth their salt could possibly have been proud of serving frozen hash brown patties and bland eggs benedict. An A for service; an F for food."}
{"text":"Butler's Pantry has been our relaxing \"to go\" place for a few years now.  The food is from very nice to delicious (Tandoori Chicken Penne is delicious, the Jambalaya is really good if you like spicy, the Bul go gi is a meat lovers' delight, the Khowsway and the Beef Burgundy Casserole are personal favourites; the Mac and Cheese is also very good).  Brunch is pretty decent, nothing too exciting but definitely quite yummy.  We love it here also because of the friendly staff, the nice relaxing atmosphere, you can talk without having to yell to be heard.  The only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is that they took out of the menu the Chicken Pie and the Quiche which were both amazing.... but still plenty of great choices on the menu :)"}
{"text":"Just wanted something a little different for brunch so we tried this place. Looked busy and the dishes we saw as we sat looked good. However things went downhill from there. A good 10 minutes just to get the waitress over to take our coffee order. We ordered the blueberry scone with our coffee and the chicken club and eggs Benedict with smoked salmon. The scone, came within a few minutes but it has obviously been microwaved and was dry. It did come with a large dollop of canned whip cream and off the shelf jam. Then our mains came. The Eggs Benedict was poached to perfection but that didn't help with the blandest hollandaise sauce I ever tasted and defrosted smoked salmon. The home fries with the dish came out of the frozen section of the nearby supermarket  The club sandwich was strangely cold and our suspicion that it had been made hours previously and stored in the fridge before arriving at our table was confirmed when the toasted bread was soaked with juice from the tomato. So disappointed. Too bad because similar things have been noticed by previous yelpers."}
{"text":"Hubby and I stopped in for a lunch yesterday.  The food was ok but bland bland bland.... his eggs benedict --nothing to it.  Just ok, very bland hollandaise.  I tried the Egyptian style lential/rice/tomato sauce dish.  I would expect some flavour to pop if the food is middle eastern style, instead the tomato sauce was like the tomato sauce found on Cabbage rolls (and to boot, there was cabbage in it.... don't recall cabbage being an ingredient in many Middle Eastern Dishes but anyway...), and it too, was bland.  Season your food, people.  Bonus points for the fresh, crisp salads and house made dressings , we enjoyed those.  If the food was as seasoned as your salad dressings that would help."}
{"text":"I have been going there for at least 10 years although I haven't as of late, which is not as long as you may think since the place has been there since 1985  Pretty much the best thing about this locale is the patio, hence the three stars, otherwise it would get two.  During the Summer and Fall, a glass of wine and some writing on their covered patio always hit the spot for me. Markham is such a pretty little street during the warmer months.   I am really bad at judging good coffee (Sorry Anna) but some of my friends who are coffeeholics utterly swear the Pantry's coffee to be among the worst in Toronto. Now, they had plenty of years to get better at it, yet they haven't. All I am saying is, don't just go for the coffee.   Now, I used to be a big fan of their Squire sandwich, great, delicious, healthy and cheap. Not anymore. Since now at $4.50 you can't justify bread with just veggies when a chicken shawarma is more filling and cost a few cents less. Their other sandwiches are just alright.   Their Jambalaya is a stab into the hearts of  Louisiana Creole chefs everywhere. Just thin & bland in taste.  The one dish that had me coming back over the years was their Tandoori Chicken Penne... it was quite delicious actually. Which when I started going was $7.95. Sadly over the years, I have seen the price creep up slowly to $11.95 while the portions got a tiny bit smaller & smaller and what is worse, the flavour got worse. Or to be exact, they re-heated the dish badly and for some reason it started coming out chewy more often than not. At $12, that is just not acceptable.  So like a car you buy and over the years you see it starting to show it's cracks and the paint chipping off, this place seems to be aging however the Buttler's Pantry is no Aunties & Uncles, so there is no Kitsch redeeming value to be mined. They are just getting old and stale.  Still the cute little patio... go for a glass of wine, just not the house white or the food. If you want a great meal, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Personally, The Butler's Pantry (chain) used to be one of my favourite places to pass by on a lazy Saturday/Sunday Brunch or Lunch. In fact, one of my favourite dishes use to be the Tandoori Chicken Penne.   However the food for the most part has fallen in quality over the last 5 years or so and it is no longer the delight that it once was.   Now this location, unlike the one in the Annex has a bit more charm in the interior decour, although this really only extends to the first section when you come in as the back look a bit like the back of a Coffee shop. So in other words, an after thought, mostly meant to squeeze in more customers.    Now as far as the drinks, they are reasonably priced, specially the cheapish wine so on paper this is a great little place to squander a few hours. In practice however, I used to live in the area many years ago and I only bothered to visit this place twice, and just for limited drinks. Since if you are looking for a better overall dinner experience, or a fun night out, Butler's here is outmatched by places like Gate 403, or The Local and even All That Jazz Cafe, all just a few doors away.    Unfortunately, this location, thanks to its lack of a patio, feels more like a glorified cafe than an eatery. Only go there when you are dressed in your pijamas and are not too picky about having pre-heated food.    It only gets an extra star above two due to the nice, friendly waitress and my subjectively fond memories."}
{"text":"I like this place, but the food is just okay. It's never blown my mind by any means. But the servers and owners are really nice, and the environment is really cute. The patio is really nice, especially. It's a good space, average prices, nice people, but don't expect an out of this world meal.  Really big selection, though, including breakfast/brunch foods and Indian fare, which is cool."}
{"text":"we stopped her because all the neigbouring patios were packed... but we weren't disappointed.  the patio is cute with a cute patio furniture that reminds you of garned patios.  the staff is very attentive and the prices are cheap.  we only had refreshing drinks so can't say how the food is but home made strawberry lemonade is definitely yummy!"}
{"text":"VERY disappointed, having recently visited the Butler's Pantry on Roncesvalles.  We actually were giving it a second second chance, as last fall a group of us stopped in for brunch (which was just okay, nothing great) at the same location on a Sunday and found out on the following Tuesday that the credit card we had used to pay for our brunch had been compromised.  This definitely left an unsettling feeling with us, but having had only good experiences from the Queen Street location before it closed down, we thought we would give the Roncesvalles a second try.  This time we were sure to pay in cash, however, it didn't make any difference in our impression.  We were forced to sit in the back this time, which is dark, hot and felt quite dirty.  That area could definitely use a facelift.  As well, the service was extremely slow, the place didn't have many people and it still took a considerable amount of time to get our food, and when we did, we were quite disappointed.  What is sad about the samosas and crab cakes, is that we could have bought better tasting ones from President's Choice or No Frills.  The samosas were bland and the crab cakes (which were definitely not the same as we had previously), were store bought patties and soggy.  The pieces of lettuce used as garnishing that both entrees came on hardly helped with the presentation and made it look cheap.  The Governor sandwich was quite soggy and the bacon in the Cricket Club was undercooked and fatty, and the chicken in it was the same type of chicken I've seen at Walmart (package for $5) for sandwiches, as I recognized the consistency and shape of it.    What has happened at that location?    Is the other one similar?  We used to be regulars at the Queen Street location, where it was always busy, but the food came fast, it was a great atmosphere to be in and the food was always good.  Unfortunately, until the menu or restaurant itself is updated or gets a facelift, we will not give it a third chance."}
{"text":"J'ai essayé la pastilla, c'est mangeable, mais c'est pas une pastilla...  Je suis tombé des morceaux de poulet plus gros que mon pouce et pas vraiment tendre, en principe le poulet d'une pastilla s'effrite. Et malheureusement je n'ai pas eu de sucre avec... Sinon le service est génial !"}
{"text":"Some like it hot, some like it not.  That is the best way to describe this place.  The atmosphere is very chill, tucked away on Markham Street with all the rest of the cute restaurants and bars on that row.  Starting out with the FISHCAKES.  They were good, the dipping sauce was delicious - garlicky, a little bit creamy, but it really make the fish cakes more tasty.  The mains were where I liked my dish, but my boyfriend did not like his...  I had the recommended BEEF BUL-GO-GI, which was a great portion.  Came with a scoop of white rice and a side salad (their dressing was a delicious orange vinagerette, almost asian-y).  The Beef Bul-go-gi itself was very tasty, full of flavor and sauce!  My boyfriend had the KHOWSWAY, which he didn't like, it was flavorless and there were a lot of noodles, topped with a lot of parmasen cheese to enhance the non-flavor.  There was about 2 or 3 pieces of chicken and it just looked and tasted bland.  I was almost temped to ask for more sauce, and he said he should have got mine.    Anyways, the service was great, and the vibe was really chill.  Great to go on a group date or even a low key date with drinks later on at Victory's Cafe.    I think if I go again, it would purely be for the BEEF BUL-GO-GI dish, otherwise, not so much."}
{"text":"The service was kind of slow but the waitress was nice...nice enough to make me feel bad about the s*** rating but the food was pretty meh. I went there with two of my sisters and girlfriend. Girlfriend couldn't even eat her meal and just send it back. I was starving so I destroyed my plate which was the bag..go.. Beef thing. It was salty as hell but I didn't care. We tried to order the Squire but they were out of sprouts and we tried to order the hummus but they were out of that too. You can feel the differences in temperature from the microwaved food which is pretty crap...but like I said, I was really hungry. If you are starving and don't give much of a **** about WHAT you eat as long as you're eating then by all means go for it. You are better off going to no frills and microwaving your own s***"}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday afternoon for brunch. Yep they serve weekday brunch, which was a nice treat at 12pm.   When we arrived, although we were given a look of \"I'm not sure where to put you\" even though there seemed to be plenty of room. I'm not sure why.   The menu has some good options and they offer a lunch menu too. There is some Asian Fusion things like Indian Style Scrambled Eggs, curry and bulgolgi. I'd be interested in trying one day.   We opted for the French Toast and Eggs Benedict with bacon. Good prices $10 each. We a little disappointed that the Eggs were over cooked, but overall tasted okay. Would have been nice to add some fruit to this. Fries were crunchy. Not amazing, just standard. The French Toast was yummy, but would have been nice if the whipped cream that it was supposed to come with arrived at our table. Cheap fruits was on top like melons, as opposed to berries.   Overall it was good, but not sure I'd come back with all the other options on this wonderful street. I didn't really feel welcome by the server that was working there today."}
{"text":"Tasty and original food... A very good choice as it is not expensive, but very healthy and delicious without being hokey.  A great place to have a great meal and feel at home!"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend for a Sunday brunch.  Between the two of us, we had their pumpkin soup, veggie eggs benny and salmon eggs benny.    The pumpkin soup was full of flavour and quite creamy.  In terms of the eggs benedict, while there wasn't anything wrong with it, I felt there was a lack (or bland) Hollandaise song. It was okay, but I always expect a \"wow factor\" with eggs benny.    What is nice about this is that it wasn't packed because we tried to go to another place and said the wait was 1 hour.   Verdict: It's decent, but nothing special."}
{"text":"Brunch is bad. Had the eggs benedict. Bland thick hollandaise, practically solid, eggs were poached too long. Came with cheap homefries. No fruit. 2 stars for poor value to $ spent."}
{"text":"Inside I sat myself of course next to the Cake Fridge as I notice the single server working away.  A Daughter/Mother team did the same while the waitress walked to the back.  Another group walked in and went to the back, that's how I figured out the back has seating too.  When the waitress got back, we got Menus and took our order/drink.  She was very Friendly I found, but she had her hands full even at 50% resto capacity on this Weeknight.  Chicken Bastilla Pie($11.95) served simply, no razzle dazzle.  As the person next time me noted, \"Family Style\" meal.  It was Comfort Food with a TWIST because this dish in particular brings Moroccan flavours noticed within the Spices used.  You can see the Pie as if you're at home passing it around and each taking a slice.  Cinnamon/Almond/Egg mixture was in an obvious layer that brings a sweetness/crunchiness which tops the Chicken/Mushroom provides the COMFORT side much like a Chicken Pot Pie however it wasn't with Gravy but a Sauce that I couldn't distinguish however noticed a bit of Yellow(Turmeric?).  The Phyllo was done up well like how most Greek Phyllo Pastries are but this one was definitely Buttery Crust.  I'm not wow'd but at the same time it did serve it's purpose of a good nutritional meal if you don't over-analyze it.  It's not a Dinner Date you plan in advance, it's more like last-second decision you walk inside with your Pajamas and eat your home cooked meal(cooked by others) that gives a bit of difference than your Campbell's Chunky.  BP shows me Moroccan dishes aren't just Tagines and Cous Cous.  Thank you."}
{"text":"We've been coming to the Butler's Pantry for a long, long time, usually for Brunch. The food is good, not amazing, but good. It's not the food that brings us back though. There's something about the place that is casual, cozy and comforting.  The staff is warm and genuine, the coffee is good, and it's in one of our favourite neighbourhoods.  Our last dish there was the Lamb Mussaka - a Greek casserole made up of eggplant, cinnamon, lamb, scalloped potatoes and tomato sauce.  To be honest, it could have used more of the tomato sauce and the scalloped potatoes needed some salt - but after adding salt ourselves, we enjoyed it.   Their scones are amazing! They're big and dense and they're served warm. They come with an unsweetened cream and a lovely jam.   It's a great place to meet with friends for an unrushed and casual bite to eat.  In a city and hood where everything is always changing, the fact that Butler's Pantry has been there forever just warms our hearts in a way."}
{"text":"Great patio. Perfect for a nice afternoon, tucked away from the bustle of Bloor st. Service was good, ordered the hummus, that was good too!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure if Yelp's categorization as Asian Fusion is accurate...The restaurant has select dishes from around the world and they put their own spin on it. The food was great, cheap, and was diverse enough that practically anybody could find something they'd enjoy.  We were a group of 7 when I went and 5 of us had great meals. The other two had bad luck and I don't think it was very representative of the restaurant. Despite the two bad experiences, the people voiced their concerns and the restaurant did not charge for their meal, so I'd say the service is pretty good as well.  If you're in the Bloor and Bathurst area and want a cheap tasty meal, definitely give Butler's Pantry a shot!"}
{"text":"Great perogies!  Seriously, Butler's Pantry offers a $5 for 3 perogies that is a delicious daily special you should take advantage of if you're down Roncy way.  They're a bit... odd, but tasty nonetheless:  spinach and feta filled, with a side of thick sour cream and a small pile of caramelized onions with a touch of cumin.  I was incredulous, but damned if I wasn't pleasantly surprised.  Unfortunately, my sandwich was a bit subpar -- the bread was toasted and had a 40 grit sandpapery \"I will destroy the roof of your mouth\" texture to it that just isn't cool.  I'm sure most readers are familiar with what I'm describing here.  Regardless, it kinda hurt to eat.  The fillings -- veggies all -- were nice enough, but a bit mushy and sparse.  The rest of the menu was confusing.  As others have noted, they have what can kindly be called an \"eclectic\" menu; some might refer to it as \"unfocused\", \"scattershot\", or \"hit and miss\".  It struck me as though the house put together a list of things they enjoyed eating and/or cooking and figured it would be great.  I'm sure some of the dishes are good.  I'm equally sure some aren't, and judging by the very mixed reviews here I sincerely think they need to do some revision.  I hope they do, 'cuz those perogies are fiiiiiine.  There's some skill in that there kitchen, it just needs a bit more focus.  Outside of the food, I found the service good, very friendly and helpful, though a bit overwhelmed (one girl for the whole place); layout is your typical diner, though split into two rooms, which makes the poor server's job that much tougher.  She does admirably all things considered.  Final note:  it apparently has poor airflow (judging by a conversation overheard between server and regular patron).  That's why it was very cold there while I ate.  They had a door open.  If they close the door, it's very hot.  Diners should bear this in mind.  Let's say 4 star for the perogies and service, 2 for the sandwich and chill, for an average score of 3.  I'm sure I'll return, though I won't be in a rush unless I'm craving the perogies!"}
{"text":"I just love this place - awesome ambiance (both inside and outside Patio), great service and amazing variety in food.   The taste is a subjective thing but I like most of the dishes I've tried here!"}
{"text":"This location is great for a group brunch on Roncesvalles. I called a few days in advance and they were generous enough to offer our group of 20 the entire back room for Sunday brunch. Booking the back room worked really well for a group of that size. The staff were on their game, especially in dealing with so many orders coming in at once. Naturally, we had some figuring out to do with the bills, but they were good enough to at least split up the orders by table. I'm looking forward to future visits!"}
{"text":"Can someone explain what the big deal is? The service was nice but the back room might be the most depressing environ since the bar scene from Magnolia with William H Macy. Seriously, all I could think of when eating my bland quiche was \"I need braces!\"   Maybe I'm missing something?"}
{"text":"Tandori chicken penne.. AMAZING.  other items good also, butt the tandoori keeps me coming back.  Great house salad dressing as well."}
{"text":"Our server was Marcus and our experience was amazing. He really made the whole night completely enjoyable. His attention to detail and his quick wit and charm were impeccable. He always anticipated our needs. My friends and I had a great time!"}
{"text":"the best thing about this place was the service.  the waitress we had was very attentive from start to finish.  this place has a mixture of a whole bunch of cooking styles.  therell be a little indian, a little american, a little burmese (which i had), some quiches, etc.  the variety is great.  the appearance and reality of healthier options is great.  the actuality is mediocre.  i had a mediocre caesar salad.  i have decided that i will not order caesar in any restaurant from now on unless im told from word of mouth that its great. otherwise, i can make the same thing BETTER at home.  i have had awesome caesar salads and none of them were in restaurants, some vegetarian, some not (in traditional, theres anchovies in the dressing.).    the main i ordered was called the khowsway.  that was the most exciting thing about it. its name.  it was a curry coconut milk pasta with fresh cucumber, tomato and chicken.  sounds good, but it was a bit bland.  i could have made it better, and i did - at home, as a leftover; in fact, im eating right now.  (he takes a bite)  i had a heineken, (the only beer on tap was steam whistle. boring.)  so if i had to choose, i wouldnt come back here. it was good in terms of price, and for a healthier or close to healthy option."}
{"text":"Very good food.  Service is a little slow but has a nice cozy atmosphere while you wait.  Staff are friendly."}
{"text":"** Shortly after sending an email to the owner and writing this review I received an email apologizing for the situation with an offer for a gift certificate for our troubles. Great customer service Butler's! We'll definitely give you another chance.**  Unfortunately my wife and I had a horrible experience last night at Butler's. It was my wife's birthday so we decided to go for dinner. The restaurant was relatively busy and there was only one server. We waited 10 minutes just to be acknowledged. Then we had to ask for our table to be wiped as it was dirty. After waiting another 10 minutes we had to flag the server to ask for drinks. She basically refused and said there were other tables ahead of us that hadn't been served and complained how busy she was. After another 15 minutes with not even a drink order we left.  We've been going to Butler's for over 10 years and have never received such bad service. Given the state of things on Roncesvalles with construction and businesses closing you'd think the Butler's management would be happy to have a busy establishment and perhaps add another server for the dinner rush?  Hopefully this was an isolated incident as it is hard to find good food these days."}
{"text":"Their food is pretty darn good, the service is subpar... normally takes forever to get a waitress or get food to your table.. but the good news is that the food is fresh - soups and salads are amazing, spinach nut casserole is off the hook... love the food..."}
{"text":"This is how out-of-touch I've come with this franchise.  Firstly, I didn't know that they franchised.  So, that's bad on my part.  I knew of them from what I believe to be their original location on Roncesvalles (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/butlers-pantry-toronto-3), and it appears that they've done so well that they've expanded.  Good for them.  I wish I could tell you that I found them as I walked through the many eateries on Markham, looking for something new, came across this new version of an old friend, settled down, and had a wonderful meal.  That didn't happen.  I was waiting for a bus to take me to a stag and this place had a patio to have beer on.  It wasn't until I bought my pint that I realized that this was in fact a Butler's Pantry.  It kind of felt like accidentally hitting on your friend's mom.  The tap list is local, bordering on organic and the menu is the same as the other.  A quick check with the wait staff (friendly even dealing with guys on the way to a stag) that the Bul Go Gi (the ONLY thing that I've ever eaten at a Butler's Pantry) is the same recipe.  I'll have to come back for more than beer."}
{"text":"This place was a find from ages ago and they have since grown.  However, the original still feels like the first place.  Tucked away on Roncesvalles in the long line of eateries that stretch up to Bloor, this feels like the original.  Back in the day, the place used to be dry.  Now, it's licensed and you can get beer that is local and in some cases organic.  I'll level with you.  I can't speak for the menu save one dish.  I've only had Bul Go Gi.  It was the first place I've ever had it and I can't not order it whenever I go there.  It's a fantastic signature dish that keeps me coming back.  Consistently.  I will bet the Jumbalaya, the Khowsway, and the Beef Burgundy are great.  But I don't know.  I probably never will.  It's hard to deter from the existing path."}
{"text":"We went for brunch and both thoroughly enjoyed our food. Service was good and we liked the place. Well priced and delicious food. I'd go back!"}
{"text":"I think the 2 star rating description really sums up my time here \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" It has a reputation it certainly hasn't earned.  Original server was great, then the shift changed and we became the table that time/the server forgot. Then my order got messed up and rather than put some effort in to making it right, they served me the worst omelet I've had at a restaurant, then made me pay for it.   I guess I should have kicked up more of a fuss, but later even the server admitted the omelet looked less than awesome when it came out of the kitchen. I will not be returning, nor will anyone I know if i can help it."}
{"text":"Butlers Pantry may actually be a perfect name for this place.   I say this because I assume that in the heyday of Butlers, they probably ended up with all the leftovers the Lord of the Manor didn't want.   I would assume these secondhand cast-asides likely lacked in freshness, quality and any  discernible logic as to why one would eat them together, aside from the fact that they were available.      If my envisioning of how servants were treated, back when butlers were actually a thing, is accurate, then I give full marks to this restaurant for their very literal naming of their establishment.  Not one thing Suk or I ate was fresh, of good quality or even freshly cooked. More on the \"freshly cooked\" later.    We ordered a salad, he, a Curry pie, myself, a special which I forget the specific name of but was a beef stew of some sort.   Fast forward 40 minutes when all three things come together (this is NOT a busy restaurant).  The food was terrible.  Terrible.  His pie was soggy,  my food was soggy yet tough, the salad was wilted.  Neither of us managed more than two bites before we decided we were giving up and would go somewhere else.    When the waitress (very young, inexperienced, nothing her fault) came by, I expressed our displeasure with the food and asked her whether our food had just been microwaved and sent to our table.  To this, she replied, \"Yes. We don't have a complete kitchen here.  We make our food for the week ahead and then microwave it for orders, but we make it fresh each week\"  Pardon?  You don't actually have a kitchen? You just served us something, not good to begin with, that you made a week ago, microwaved and then had a Load of the Manor perception that you could charge us $15 a plate?   Are you nuts?   Terrible business model, terrible training of waitstaff, terrible gouging of money.  I would not pay $1 to eat anything from this place.  Just terrible."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst restaurant experiences I have had in this city. Everything seems as if it were frozen and then microwaved just before serving. Pirogies were super hot on the outside, yet cold on the inside. I got a vegan dish that looked as if it had been frozen for at least six months and microwaved three times. I would rather walk into a neighbour's apartment and take some random food frozen in a repurposed margarine container WITH FROSTBITE than eat here again."}
{"text":"I came here last summer with two friends while we were visiting Toronto. I'm actually a little surprised by all the negative reviews because I remember enjoying my food a lot. We came here for brunch on a saturday afternoon and I think we were the only table there.  I ordered their take on a chicken pot pie -- they added a bit of curry powder to the filling so it was more unique. It was really good, but I couldnt finish the whole thing because it got too heavy for me. My two friends ordered their french toast and I think they really enjoyed it.   I dont remember the service, but I did really like the patio seating, especially because that street is really pretty and has a relaxed vibe.  With all the choices in Toronto, I wouldnt say that i'd come back here the next time I visit. I think it mightve been a little expensive for the food they served."}
{"text":"The menu here is interesting, unique, and covers many different types of cuisine from all around the world. The portions are generous and the food is pretty good. There could be better descriptions of each item and the water glasses are way too small. If you're in the area give it a shot, but I wouldn't make a special trip."}
{"text":"The Butler's Pantry at 371 Roncesvalles Avenue is a well kept secret on a street full of inexpensive home cooking.  It is a ten minute walk south from Dundas West station, and also accessible by the 504 Streetcar. There are tables at the front near the windows, or further at the back.  We got a bright table by the windows with a good view of the street.  Curious people occasionally look in the window at the restaurant and for those who have yet to enter I encourage you all to give it a try.  I would like to thank yelp.ca and also a gracious co-worker for recommending this restaurant.  Let's talk menu. (http://www.butlerspantry.ca/Menu.html)  Our server was knowledgeable about the menu, and very pleasant.  I was impressed by the great variety of exciting choices.  At 10 am on a Saturday, you can order from breakfasts, lunches, dinners or desserts. They offer many exotic choices such as: Biryani ($7.95), Jambalaya ($9.25), and Vegetable Lasagna ($9.25) as mains.  Main courses also include a nutritious salad.  The brunch menu offers many kinds of eggs, bagels, scones and sandwiches based on things like smoked salmon, vegetarian, crab, and chutney. There was truly something for everybody.  Although the choices are a bit off the wall - for example, you won't find a Hamburger on their menu.  The menu contains barely any processed food.  The choices are made with fresh ingredients and are quite nutritious.   I chose the Jambalaya - (Butler's Pantry description) Our version of the classic Cajun dish. Spicy tomato rice with chicken, zucchini, carrots, leaks, mushrooms and onions....$9.25 Much of the Butler's Pantry menu contains healthy, balanced meals and the Jambalaya is not exception.  It is a fantastic blend of nutrition and taste.  It contains rice for carbohydrates and fibre.  Tomatoes, zucchini, carrots, leeks, mushrooms and onions are the vegetables and fibre.  Chicken for protein.  The only major food group absent was dairy. However, the Jambalaya is low in fat, and a good choice. Even the name Jambalaya brought back memories of the \"Soup Nazi\" episode from Seinfeld.  As I had never tried it before, this was a bold choice for me and may not please everyone.   The warning of spice, which turned out to be a warm mild taste, was a concern for me because I don't like hot, spicy foods.  I will admit the Jambalaya was a strange choice for the time of day I was there (10:30 am), but this is a testament to the versatility and quality of their menu.    Less than a month ago, I had brunch at Oddfellows on Queen Street West where they had a disappointingly tiny brunch menu with perhaps 10 items. The Butler's Pantry, in contrast, offers more than 30 items all day. Also, it was an excellent value when compared with other brunch locations nearby such as Oddfellows or Dr. Generosity (Bloor & Runnymede).  Mains are under $10 plus they give free refills on coffee.  It was a cozy and clean place where you can relax for an hour or two, chat and listen to some tunes. Music was tasteful including Hendrix, Rush, Led Zeppelin and the Hip. The sound level of the music was perfect. Loud enough to hear but we were not deafened by it.  Finally be sure to check out their posting board for: community events, ads, and section of free newspapers.  There was lots of cool information.  For example, we picked up a pamphlet that was a full colour fold-out map of Roncesvalles/Parkdale showcasing restaurants and businesses in the area. In summary, I highly recommend Butler's Pantry for lunch, or really anytime. I imagine it could have a very different vibe around dinner time on a weekend, when it could be quite full and noisy. I am inclined to go back to try some of the other myriad of exotic and original choices on their menu.  It's impressively healthy, nutritious and tasty.  The service was great, the atmosphere relaxing, and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Washrooms smell of really really strong insect repellant, disgusting amount of fruit flies around the kegs in the back and the front of the restaurant smells like feces. Honestly, walked in, ordered a drink saw the conditions, walked out."}
{"text":"Cozy restaurant in a great location. The food fusions are \"interesting\", and offer a mishmash of ethnic cuisine. My sultan sandwich was a paratha  stuffed with seasoned beef, red onions, and a tamarind dressing. Light in flavour, nice presentation. My friend had the lamb moussaka and it was like one she'd never had---I don't mean that in a good way. The texture of the lamb was tough and the seasoning on the dish was not kind on the tastebuds. Service was attentive and friendly. If we go back, we will definitely not be ordering the moussaka."}
{"text":"Sat in a group of 6 and the food took 55 minutes to start arriving. Also, one of us got told her dish was not available 45 minutes after we ordered. Luckily she ordered a starter so she did not go hungry.   For some reason they only had 1 waitress running around the whole time. She barely stopped by our table and thus did not see our need for more water.   Variety of food on the menu and good portion sizes. I like their salad dressing. Had the jambalaya - wasn't bad.  It's too bad the wait was so long.."}
{"text":"This place is great if you enjoy being served made-ahead and microwaved entrees.  Its glorified left-overs!  why would you pay $10-12 for that when you're surrounded by lots of other delicious food on roncys? certainly not the ambience.. its dingy and kind of depressing.    and the bulgogi, the one item they make fresh, is ok at best. cloyingly sweet and heavily salted at the same time.  koreatown isnt that far away, do yourself a favour and get it at an authentic restaurant for half the price a couple subway stops down the line."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst restaurant I have ever been .. we walked in and no waiter around to give us a table, we saw one empty, but was dirty..  food was tasteless.. what a joke... the menu offers Indian food, burgers and nothing blends together .. I got a burger which didn't taste anything ... I asked to change the chips for a bit of salad and the cook got crazy for that .. yelling at the waiter why she has wants to change the chips for salad ( we could hear what he was saying from the table we were sitting), as expected the salad was only few old rocket leaves and three pieces of tomato ... no even a drop of dressing  .. that place is a hole on the ground... no recommended ... go somewhere else  ... one more thing .. we were four and they brought the food a different times .. I wish there was a 1/2 start in this review .. I am being too generous given one complete start"}
{"text":"This place is terrible. Just terrible. Wandered in with my brother for dinner. First thing we noticed was that the restaurant was empty, which is never a good sign. We sat down and ordered a pitcher and quickly noticed it would have been cheaper to simply drink by the pint. In any event...  We ordered the baba ganouche  to start - bland bland bland. The cucumber was good at least.   I had the bulgogi and my bro had the curry. The bulgogi must have been pressed salt formed to look like real food. It was almost unbearable. The curry was bland and we were only able to find three pieces of meat in it. It was really quite terrible.    We complained and the server told us that the quality was not great. I told her they better get their act in gear. We left and grabbed some fast food on the way home.   If I could give a 0 I would.  Do not eat here!"}
{"text":"I was supposed to meet someone at the Victory Cafe on a Sunday in the afternoon, and it turned out it was closed. So we ended up going to Butler's Pantry up the street. I had heard good things about the place before, and they had Tankhouse on tap at least.  Sadly, I think they only had Tankhouse and Organic on tap, as they only had two taps. So not a lot of variety to choose from. I also ordered a meal, it was the Biryani which contained chunks of stew beef. The dish looked quite pretty, I will give them that. But the chunks of beef were quite tough and not properly cooked down... I expected tender chunks of beef. These pieces were cooked enough so that they were cooked through and that was it.  Might be okay to go for a drink and a nibble."}
{"text":"The Butler's Pantry is nothing fancy, but it sure is cheap, tasty, and reliable. You can get an entire meal with a drink for about $15! It's a great place to go if you're not feeling up to making dinner, but are trying to curb your spending.  My personal favorites are the curried vegetable pie and the zucchini pancakes. Their salad dressing is pretty decent as well. They only have one location these days, but it's never too busy so the service is always great."}
{"text":"The food is alright here, nothing that would tempt me across the city. I might stop by if I was in the area, but there are so many other tasty spots in Ronces.   The service is also alright, but nothing special."}
{"text":"Butler's pantry has a eclectic menu with dishes drawing from Indian, Italian, Korean, and Middle Eastern amongst many more.  We opted to sit outside and enjoy the pleasantness of Markham St. They carry a couple craft beer options which is nice."}
{"text":"Butlers pantry is one of those places where I find myself stumbling through the door while still deciding on what to eat.  The variety of ethnic comfort food will deliver a hearty satisfaction to nearly any craving.  A pleasant atmosphere, decent size portions, reasonable prices and tasty selections make this a semi-regular destination for me.  The Bul go gi is a signature dish but I find the consistency to be lacking.  The sauce can be a little sweet at times and the meat appears to be of a lesser grade from past experiences.  Most dishes have already been prepared and are simply reheated when served.  Still, the Lamb Moussaka and Moroccan style Chicken Bastilla Pie are among my favourites.  The latter of which can make a guest envious when you begin to salivate over the layers of buttery filo pastry.  *drool*  All the main dishes are served with a fresh garden salad with a side of zesty home made dressing.  It's a charming place with a friendly staff who serve with a subdued casualness. This could be the X factor in terms of service on busy day but a perfect remedy for a quiet afternoon."}
{"text":"Going through my reviews I realized I accidentally reviewed the wrong location. This one, not the Roncesvalles location, is actually the one I went to (and it was probably over a year ago). I'm copying/pasting the review that I accidentally put for the wrong location:  A friend and I were hungry and this was really close and since I've never been here we decided to go here.  Everything is overprice considering it's an absolute dive that looks like a cross between the lunch cafe at a hospital and an old folk's cafe.   I'm surprised they passed the Toronto Health inspection. Salt and pepper shakers had brown stuff crusted on it. At first we thought it was rust but then realized someone got really excited to salt and pepper their food that they ended up putting the shakers in their food (and not cleaning them off).  Smoked salmon bagel had like no smoked salmon on it for the price it was. And 3 capers and 3 small fat red onion rings. Not the way I'm used to eating it so kind of disappointing. The salad was pretty good.  They ran out of all of the good juices to make many of their cocktails. I don't understand how you run out of lemonade and lemon juice and can't just get some.  I wouldn't come here again unless I was super desperate or something and couldn't travel farther to a better place."}
{"text":"\"There's always the Butler's Pantry\" says a lot about the unassuming, but dependable restaurant. It's probably not your first choice, but it'll always be there if the restaurant of your choice is too busy or closed that day. The \"homestyle\" dishes are affordable and comforting. The decor is homey and relaxed.  We stopped in for a quick bite during the early dinner hour. While my dinner dates (who both grew up in the Roncey neighbourhood) both opted for the tried and true sheppards pie, I made the rookie mistake of going with the crab salad sandwich and hated it. The bland melted cheddar atop of the generous blob of chopped previously frozen imitation pollock stick doused in mayo was bad.   The home-style unsweetened iced tea as well as the service was great though. I'll be sure to go back to gather a more thorough sampling of the Butler's offerings."}
{"text":"Let first say that their salad that usually comes with the meal is superb. The dressing is so delicious. The whole thing is very vibrant and crunchy. nomnomnomn on those leaves! As well, the food is delicious. Goddamn, the portions are fuckin' huge! I tried a few things from here before. First off, the jambalaya was GIGANTIC, fit for a God. I had to get take out for sure. The flavours were nice. A hint of spice and lots of flavour in each bite. I also tried the Khowsway, which wasn't anything special, but it was good. As for the Vegetable Curry Pie and Chicken Bastilla Pie? Just scrumptious. So much flavour. The pie is light and flaky. REally just lovely and the filling, well it's plain STUFFED. Love it. I also tried: Vegetable Lasagna (not bad, had better), Bulgogi (it's different, but i still love the real korean bulgogi the best) , Shepards Pie (only thing i would not recommend).  Everyone says their french toast is to die for, but for me, I actually didn't really like it. It was a hunk of big toast and there wasn't enough flavour for me. Perhaps it is because I have a knack for sweeter things when french toast comes in mind, but if you're more for a light eggy taste, then this is for you! The portion is yet again, very big. Overall, the place is a cozy environment and the food is so affordable."}
{"text":"I love the menu at this place (although, in 3 years it hasn't changed, would be nice to add some new dishes or something seasonal on occasion)  The prices are right and the food is great, but I find the service sllloooowww and we always have to wait a long time for the food to arrive. If you are starving, give this place a skip because you will go crazy waiting for the food to arrive. But the Chicken Bastilla Pie is worth waiting for.  Menu items I've tried:  Hummus - TRY IT! Very good and super cheap, only $3.25 for a decent amount served with pita chips (plus it's nice to have something to eat while you wait a zillion years for the main dish to arrive)  Scones - cheap, huge and very tasty  Bulgogi - Good, but I'd rather go to a nearby Korean place to get the real deal  Beef Burgandy - OK  Biryani - decent  Chicken Bastilla Pie - now THIS is the reason I go here - this is the tastiest thing ever, do try it if you go :) *nom nom nom*  Jambalaya - pretty good  Moussaka - also pretty good  Main dishes are usually served with a large salad and house dressing which is very nice.   They have a nice patio which is lovely in the summer for brunch or lunch."}
{"text":"Unsure why I ever thought a restaurant named after a repressed British food closet would be a good idea, but I'd just walked to Roncy from Bathurst and after the previous night's concert it looked appealingly dark.  I took a microbial biology with my server (awkward) so I took in good faith the diffident service and the forcing-me-to-beg-for-water-like-a-desert-exile BUT her recommendation of the zucchini pancake could be translated as: \"have this extra greasy potato pancake that is also wet and mushy and which also costs $11.\"   I am okay with being punished by food, and with food, but not like this."}
{"text":"Really great brunch spot. We went on a Sunday morning and it wasn't busy which was nice. Delicious eggs bennies and french toast."}
{"text":"Butlers pantry is awesome.  If I ever need a weekend brunch. This is where I take my girlfriend. We've been coming here for over a year now.   The eggs Benedict is amazing, and \"the squire\" is a great light lunch sandwich.   If you live in the annex, you have to have brunch here at least once.   The service is prompt and friendly. And being a server myself, that's saying something.   Be wary of mid Sunday mornings as there tends to be a lot of family's in and it gets quite loud."}
