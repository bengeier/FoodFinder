{"text":"Ehh. Ok. Nice looking spot, but the entrees left something to be desired. Bar was full, but would be a good spot to just drink."}
{"text":"Very nice setting at affordable price with refined cuisine and good service. What else is needed? I seldom make review. But this bistro is worth the detour for sure"}
{"text":"Finally had dinner at the new 111 Bistro, tonight. Overall, it was an excellent experience. I have traveled the world for over thirty-five years, and I must say \"complimenti\" to 111 Bistro. The menu is esoteric and filled with variety, from sandwiches, to pastas, to beef, to pork, to lamb, to chicken, to duck. Better, these are not Applebees' crap, warmed in a plastic bag. The duck I had tonight was lightly cooked, flavorful, and juicy. It was served with a green tea black rice garnish that was innovative and delicious. But first, I had a cup (really a bowl) of pasta fagioli, which was fresh, hot and nice.   I ate at the friendly bar, served by a knowledgeable bartender, Anthony. He provided good advice (and facts) about the menu. I had a beer with the soup, a house Malbec with the duck and rice, and a house Riesling with a dessert cheesecake. I followed it all up with decaf coffee, which was as flavorful as good, real, leaded coffee.  I have no relationship with 111 Bistro, at all. I happily paid the bill. First impression was excellent. I'd say:  Menu - 5* Service - 5* Food - 5* Wines - 5\" Prices - $$ (better than fairly priced) All this in Medina area - priceless.  Medina area is now blessed with two terrific, serious business, fine dining restaurants - both with a casual atmosphere, yet excellent, world class food.  111 Bistro and Thyme 2  We are barely deserving."}
{"text":"Wowza!  A foodie haven right off the interstate. My wife and I stopped in on our way home from Cleveland, on the strength of the Yelp reviews (you fellow reviewers rock).    The place itself is clean with attractive decor, and it is surprisingly large for being in a strip mall.  The staff was pleasant and attentive.  The only ding here was that the hostess placed the two-sided menus on the table with the full menu showing...it was Sunday and only the brunch menu on the other side of the menu was available. We didn't know that and tried to order items not available.  Small detail but kind of embarrassing.  The menu is just the right size with a variety of items.  All look tempting.  I had the Grilled \"Ham\" and Cheese.  It has duck bacon instead of ham, and it was fantastic.  The cherry and onion marmalade was just right to accent the rest of the sandwich.  It came with a side of Saratoga chips.  These were lightly seasoned with an intriguing spice blend.  It was something like coriander and/or cumin and/or cardamom and/or all of the above.  Whatever it is, it's just enough to be noticed and is delicious.  My wife had the Lobster Mac.  How good was it?  She says she's never having anyone else's because she's had the best.  Nuf said."}
{"text":"I was expecting this to be a grat dining experience, but was very dissapointed. The staff was unprofessional and you need a firecracker to get their attention once you order.  For a restauarant which is trying to present an upscale environment, there was much lacking. They could use some linen on the tables and could at least balance the table which rocked from side to side. When mentioning that to the waiter, he seemed unconcerned and shrugged his shoulders.  Salads were alla carte and was the smallest salad I have ever been served. It was fresh and tasty, but for the price should have been more than a taste of a salad. The bread which accompianed the salad was 3very small pieces of dried out non tasty bread the size of a quarter only a little thicker. It tasted as if it was a week old piece of bread which has sat out for the entire week. The waiter also did not seem concerned when this was mentioned.  About 1/2 hour after the salad was served, we caught the waiter to find out if our dinner was lost. He cleaned off the salad plates and procceded to remove the forks from them and set them on the table saying we would need those for dinner. We had to ask him to take away the salad forks and bring clean forks for the entre. I believe again, at this price point, that should have been done with out asking.  One of our entres was the lobster mac, that was light and delicious,  The second entre was pork butt on paperdelle noodles. This was horrible. The meat had no taste, the sauce was straight sour cream and the dish had a funny taste. Later the person who ordered this did not feel well so the left overs were thrown away for fear of food poisoning.  it took over 40 min after the entr for us to get our bill and another 15 for him to collect it. At no time did anyone inquire if we liked our dinner or if there was anything else they could get us. We were not offered dessert althogh there were some good sounding offers on the menu. For a bill which came to $100 with a tip added in, I expect much better food and at least mediocre service, neither of which we received. I will not try this place again in the near future. I hope they can fix their many shortcomings as Medina can use a good upscale but not overly pompous restaraunt that provides excellent food. It is ok to be iventive, but they need to rethink a few things here and train the staff."}
{"text":"We have dined at 111 Bistro several times since their opening and will continue to go back. The service is outstanding and the menu very unique. The serving sizes are appropriate for a healthy lifestyle and anyone who thinks otherwise should perhaps reevaluate. The brunch menu is outstanding. Everything we have tried is quite tasty. The drink menu also is amazing and the bartenders very personable. We especially enjoy the personal attention shown us every time by the two \"Anthony's\". Keep up the good work. It is so nice to see hard work pay off."}
{"text":"Pleasant surprise in Medina.  Menu offers a bit of everything.  Service can range from excellent to \"needs more experience\".  Suggest the duck wings, the salmon, and bone in pork chop (best ever).  Wine selection is also outstanding."}
{"text":"Having just moved from Chicago, my wife and I (along with our fifteen month old daughter) hadn't found a local restaurant that had genuinely impressed until we stopped in here early on a Friday night.  First of all, the menu was great having a wide range of both innovative and classic options, everything sounded great!  The food was outstanding and reminded us of the great restaurants we frequented in Chicago.  They even made a good Old Fashioned.  To top it all off, the service and people really made the experience.  We made friends with everyone there.  It's great to know there's a local Medina restaurant we can count on for a great meal and experience.  We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Very good food. I got the Bahn Mi with the 111 fries. The beer selection is also excellent to compliment the gourmet food. Definitely a place to check out."}
{"text":"We are so fortunate that Chef Anthony opened this place close to where we live.  Last nights meal was by far the best thing I have eaten anywhere in a long time!  Going out on Friday we didn't expect the \"Valentine's Day menu\" but it did not disappoint. My long bone veal chop was amazing and the grape tomato reduction was a nice accompaniment.  I stuck to my regular 111 salad and we shared the white chocolate cheesecake for dessert. The entire meal was on point!  A big thank you to Anthony behind the bar as well. You always make us feel welcome!"}
{"text":"Just keeps getting worse.  When we started going the 111, we were just thrilled with the food. The past four times we have gone the food has gotten progressively worse.  We were there yesterday for brunch and the food was tasteless and cold.  We made the decision to not go back.  It makes me feel bad because we thought they had so much potential."}
{"text":"Everything is excellent here. The chef is very inventive with his pairings and we really enjoy eating here. Plates are always well-sized and the hardest part is limiting your choices down to only a few each time - ha! We could eat the duck wings for days. I'd like to see the brunch menu offered occasionally on other days than Sunday. Hands down the best food we have had in Medina."}
{"text":"Got sat in the backroom and got our drinks about 20 minutes after ordering them. Had to ask a different waitress for refills each time. Skip the appetizer and salad..not worth it. The main meals were delicious though (Lobster Mac and short ribs). Would give it a second chance, maybe if I got seated in the main area I would receive better service...I would also know how to order better the second time around."}
{"text":"NYE dinner was wonderful. We were hard pressed to decide what to order .  Ribeye and Duck two ways were devoured. We will be back."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Although it's located in a plaza, you don't even notice once you step inside. The atmosphere and decor is rustic and warm, and the space is actually quite a big larger than it appears from the outside.  We first went on a Friday night. Their menu is extensive and appeals to all tastes and price points. I had their ahi tuna sandwich which was delicious. Portion sizes were quite large and well worth the money.   Service was excellent. We enjoyed our time so much that we returned two days late for their Sunday brunch. We had the same server and he was kind and personable and knew the menu items well. Brunch was great....I had the almond crusted French toast and it was unique and delicious. Exactly what I wanted.   Check this place out. You won't be disappointed. Medina needs a restaurant like this. It is a breath of fresh air for the community."}
{"text":"Although the food was good, the service was awful.  LONG wait, apology but nothing behind it.  We had a reservation, were there for two plus hours and had one bottle of water and one drink.  He never came back to see how we were if we needed anything ... No word from the manager not even a sorry.  We won't return."}
{"text":"A privilege to have in Medina. Service, food, atmosphere were top notch. The coctail menu is amazing as well. Chef Anthony is personable and all staff is involved in making your dining experience superior. A must! Ingredients are always fresh so we can't wait to go back to try something new."}
{"text":"6/24/2014 First to Review  My wife, daughter and myself just finished dinner at 111Bistro.  From the service to the ambiance to the quality of the food we were impressed.  Our server Sean was knowledgeable, courteous and had great timing, arriving at appropriate times throughout the meal.  The Medina area has few options when it comes to this quality of restaurant.  Kudos to the owners for taking a chance with this concept.  We sat in  a booth adjacent to the bar.  It was comfortable, cozy, not cramped and the noise level was reasonable.  Our appetizer, entrees and deserts were all interesting, well prepared and tasty.  They have a very nice selection of wine to choose from, single glasses to bottles.  Needless to say I would recommend trying 111Bistro.  Its my opinion that the owners of 111Bistro have done there homework.  I have the sense that they'll continue to innovate and perfect the experience.  We wish them much success in the future."}
{"text":"We have been going here since they first opened and have never been disappointed. Chef Anthony and staff have always made our evening out perfect. Definitely a place to frequent because the menu is always changing"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  I had the Cioppino,  special with a 111 Bistro salads.  I thoroughly enjoyed both.  Others in our party had the walleye tacos, salmon, lobster lasagna, burger and bison meatloaf.  Clean plate club...all of us.  Also had the chorizo, bacon dates as an appetizer.  Awesome.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Wonderful dinner from start to finish.  Fantastic cocktail, fresh salad, house  made pappardelle noodles were the best I've had since a trip to Italy."}
{"text":"Very slow service. Chef appears to be afraid of salt. And someone in the kitchen doesn't like to cook veggies to completion or, if undercooking for crispness, perhaps potatoes aren't the right avenue to experiment with. Bottom line is I like to see places experimenting, but if you're going to charge prices like you're ready to compete with Sawyer, you better deliver a plate that competes with Sawyer. What my wife and I experienced, both in terms of quality of food and service, wasn't keeping on par with Thyme2, much less the Greenhouse or Lola. Back to the drawing board."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and drinks at very reasonable prices. Have had multiple menu items and cannot choose a favorite. Great comfort food! Service is outstanding and music is great too!"}
{"text":"After driving past this location nearly every day since 111 Bistro opened six months ago my wife and I finally decided to give it a try. So glad we did but regret waiting so long! Front the outside the restaurant looks pretty unassuming. The interior however is decorated beautifully - just the right blend of comfort and upscale style. Great first impression. The hostess was pleasant and attentive.  We were seated at a booth adjacent to the bar which was a perfect place to observe everything that was going on. There was a good crowd and a broad mix of ages.  We spoke to many of the staff, both owners, and the father of the head chef. They all sincerely took an interest in making their restaurant welcoming, accessible, and able to compete with the upstart locations in Cleveland. They described it as \"a bit of Tremont comes to Medina.\"  We agree that they have been wholly successful doing this! The menu is just right. A bit of everything but not overwhelming. Chefs Anthony and Megan have obviously spent a great deal of time choosing what dishes to serve and getting the recipes and pairings just so. There were five or six things listed we really wanted to try.  The wine list is very reasonable and balanced. No trouble finding things we recognized and enjoyed.  111 Bistro has done a fantastic job of knowing the audience. It will appeal to those just wanting to pop in for a bit of a more casual bite to those really looking for a first-rate, chef inspired culinary adventure.  Absolutely five stars!"}
{"text":"Spent the evening at Bistro 111 on friday night,  for the first time since we have been going we experience what we would call a near perfect meal the tizer was great, the main course was excellant and the dessert was spot on. In the past we would always leave disappointed in the dessert but not this time. The chef nailed it, great staff, atmosphere and food, love it there!"}
{"text":"Friendly service at the bar, and you can't pass on the fried goat cheese app.  Been here a few times with the kids and everyone loved their meals. Give this independent restaurant a shot and you won't be disappointed.  All the pasta is house made... How awesome is that?"}
{"text":"My wife and I visited for the first time on a Saturday evening. We were attracted by a special menu run in conjunction with a local restaurant group. Cudos to our server, a pleasant little southern belle by the name of Angela. She was very busy with tables spread out between the main dining area, a larger party room and the patio. Running around like a puppy chasing its tail she managed to keep up with all of her tables admirably. She answered all of our questions in good time. I will make sure to ask for her if/when we visit again. The food was mostly very good to excellent. I had the Crawfish Poutine, an etoufee gravy loaded with crawfish and andouille and 2 crispy edged sunny side up eggs  over nice crispy fries. My wife started with the butternut squash soup and followed with the salmon over leek/onion grits. The soup was a little spicy but very tasty. The ice creams were house made and very tasty.I would only have a few criticisms to offer. If you are going to call something a wedge salad it should be an iceberg wedge, not a chunk of bibb lettuce. It should also have grape tomatoes and the balsamic glaze. The brussels sprouts we ordered were tasty but woefully under cooked, almost impossible to chew. One other thing: The noise level in the room was ridiculous. We had a hard time conversing across the table. They would benefit from some sound absorbing materials lower on the walls to cut down on the ambient volume. Based on the food and service alone I would give the restaurant a 4.5 to a 5. The sound detracted mightily from the experience hence the 3 star rating."}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous!!!! Great atmosphere!! Gem on the east side of medina!!! Meatloaf was amazing! Will definitely be back!! Cheers to 111!!!"}
{"text":"This is our go to place for out-of-town guests, girls night out and date night. The atmosphere is upscale without being uncomfortable. There is a wide selection of wine and beer and they are always changing up what's on tap. The menu is fun and inventive and also changes seasonally. The food is always well prepared and delicious. The staff is great and makes a great effort to make sure you enjoy your dining experience. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I picked a hair out of my mouth while eating the duck entree this evening.  Showed the server and they supposedly prepared a new dish. In the new dish the duck was very overdone and the side dish was very small.   The server dropped the bill and didn't return very promptly. My husband went to the bar to pay and eventually the server went to bar and threw out change at him. Very very disappointing."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Akron area. High end ones nearby charging twice as much, with no contest in quality. Menu is diverse and balanced. Everything I've had has been cooked perfectly, seasoned well, imaginative and beautifully presented. Don't miss this place."}
{"text":"I don't give five stars frequently ... it has to be special. Last night, Chef Anthony earned a five. I reviewed this establishment in August and have returned a number of times. It is my go-to fish restaurant in Medina. Last night? Being late October, I had a bowl of green apple and acorn squash soup with bacon and a hint of chiles. I feared it might be sweet; instead, it was a beautifully orchestrated combination of texture, taste and flavor. The fish was a filleted bronzino, the European sea bass that is a sea bass as opposed to the Chilean monstrosity. In the skin with attached tail - Medina and my wife aren't ready for the head yet, it was flaky, perfectly cooked and accompanied with a cauliflower sauce that enhanced the fish instead of camouflaging  it. The best? The dessert! A nicely portioned sample that fed two, it consisted of a very adequate pumpkin tart complemented by homemade sage ice cream, whole macerated cranberries and crystallized walnuts. An October surprise at its best. All this was accompanied by a nicely priced Melville pinot noir whose bright fruit and perfect balance did the supper proud. Well done, chef Anthony. Thank you, server Megan. We will be back ... soon."}
{"text":"Date night with another couple, eclectic American food in a lively atmosphere (for the suburbs!).  We started off the evening with selections from their drink menu.  They had several \"specials\" so we gave a few of them a try and really enjoyed the tastes.  Each of the couples ordered an appetizer and we shared them around the table.  Our friends got the calamari, which were perfectly crisp, spicy and slightly chewy and were served with a smoky tomato dipping sauce with great flavor. My wife and I ordered the poutine which had good flavor, just not enough curds and the sauce/gravy was on the thin side.  My wife and I both were in a red meat mood, so we did something we rarely do and got the same entree...the beef short ribs.  The dish was tender with a very light wine sauce, mustard spätzle and root vegetables (which was a nice accompaniment).  For being out in the 'burbs, the place had a great, lively vibe and the dish preparations were innovative and tasty.  A bit hard to carry on a conversation due to the boisterous nature of the space, but we had a really nice night out with friends."}
{"text":"I was hoping I would love this place! We always drive by and finally got to try it and it was just okay.  We had to send our calimari back cause it wasn't cooked all the way. We also got 3 of the 4 specials and they were nothing great. Everything was very bland and my fish had a ton of bones that it was hard to eat. Their happy hour drink specials were great though."}
{"text":"What a great place.  Had the bang mi and wife had the burger.  We have been there several times and have not felt the need to get anything else yet.  Great service, bottled water, Medina gem.  On Tap takes all the parking so plan ahead!"}
{"text":"Excellent, Michelle is a keeper. Very personable and attentive. Knowledge of the menu was the key . The lobster Mac is fantastic. Walleye is great and the short ribs are the best this side of the Mississippi"}
{"text":"Excellent food. We ordered the Butternut squash and apple soup, beet salad, burgers with salad, chicken parm, venison and fries. We loved everything. The win selection was very nice.  Ask to sit away from the door because the front of the restaurant is very drafty. Only negative is that they serve coffee mate with coffee vs. real cream. Surprising given that the menu is sourced from local farms, etc."}
{"text":"When friends were looking for a new double date spot we went to the place we've been hearing a lot of chat about 111 Bistro! The environment was perfect for friends catching up. We each ordered something quite different from each other and we're all very pleased! I had the pork chop with spaetzle and red cabbage. The bourbon sauce was the best!!!!! I had to keep myself from locking the bone clean, it was so good! I can't wait to come back again! It's a nice date night celebration destination, the kind you don't mind paying a babysitter for, so you can enjoy the space and the food with no inhibitions!"}
{"text":"Have been here twice. One dinner and brunch this time. Very friendly service and food is good. In addition, I just love their house made ketchup !!!!"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place when we first moved to the area. It is a bit classier of a place but I have been here about 5 times and my family and I have all sampled one another's food there was only one dish I did not care for. So 1/15 entrees that I didn't care for, not too bad of odds. We also recently did a beer pairing there. They provided so much food! It was fun and not a bad price for what you got."}
{"text":"Yum! I went in having never heard of the place and definitely became a fan. We took friends to brunch and the ricotta lemon pancakes were AMAZING! Everyone else seemed to enjoy what they had as well. I returned for dinner and we ordered a bunch of different appetizers to share and I was impressed with all of them. I love a unique food selection like this without feeling like they went overboard with weirdness. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"LOVED this restaurant!  Everything on the menu looked so awesome I cant wait to go back and try something new.   From the second I walked in I knew this place would be good.  The decor is very chic, nicely done. The bar was packed with classy people and there were several waiting. I recommend making reservations if going during prime times  To start i had the greens salad. It was amazing with grilled cauliflower and the lemon vinaigrette was delish. My friend had the wedge and said it was great.   We then shared the scallop. It was one jumbo and we cut it in half. The price was high but we understood once we realized it sat in lobster risotto. YUM!!!  I lived this small plate!  Lastly, since im trying to eat health(ier) i had the walleye-AMAZING!!  I dont like the skin so i quickly rolled that off and to the side but the fish itself was done to perfection!  Also the black rice and especially the kale sprouts were soooooo good.   I cant say enough good about this place!!  You have to try it, you wont be disappointed!  Service was awesome too."}
{"text":"Love this place, food, drinks & service is always great. Great place for a date or dinner and drinks with friends."}
{"text":"If there were more than 5 stars this place would get it. From the atmosphere to the wait staff to the food, everything was on point and exactly how you would want it to be. I went for brunch late on a Sunday morning with my wife and a couple of friends. I ordered the crab cake eggs Benedict my wife got these amazing pancakes, and we also ordered some lobster mac. There are not words to describe the deliciousness of everything we got. I think it's the attention to detail and the thought that is put into the dish that takes them over the top. The arugula on the side of the eggs Benedict was the perfect compliment to one of the best dishes I ever had. And when it comes to the lobster mac and cheese its crazy that I would comment on how perfect the corn that's in it was. Lastly I ordered a peanut butter and chocolate medinut. OMG!!!!! Was a donut or a croissant? I'm still not sure, and I don't care. It was amazing. The only complaint I have is that it's not closer to my house. I would recommend eating here to absolutely anyone for every occasion!! This is for sure on the short list of best places I've ever ate!"}
{"text":"Very enjoyable anniversary dinner.  We started the evening meal with a bowl of French onion soup for myself, which was outstanding, and my wife had the wedge salad, which tasted very good as well.  For the entree, I enjoyed the walleye, which was perfectly prepared.  My wife enjoyed a newer item on the menu, the lamb shoulder entree, served in a lovely sauce with sweet potato spetzel.  The dessert, an apple tort, was the definite weak link, and should be replaced with a different apple-based item.  The ice cream was a wonderful vanilla bean flavor and texture."}
{"text":"We visited this place with foodie friends from Michigan for Sunday brunch after not being able to get into a very popular place in the Akron area. WOW!!! What a great place! Wonderful atmosphere! Outstanding service! Nice craft beer draft list, AWESOME menu that changes seasonally & is prepared superbly. One of the best restaurants in the area! We will be back again, with different friends!!! CHECK IT OUT, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Wow!  Yumminess!  I have been to 111 Bistro twice now. Excellent service and many choices for your palette. I'm impressed with the culinary combinations, draught beers and wine list. Make it a point to check 111 Bistro out. New happy hour Tuesday-Saturday, some great deals!!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed 111 Bistro very much. Starting with cocktails,then on to appetizers, wine, entrees and a shared dessert everyone in our party was very happy. It was also terrific to find a place with excellent options for vegans and carnivores. The ambience was nice and our waitress was courteous and efficient. We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"The service is excellent and the food is impeccable. A wonderful oasis in a sea of fast food, chains and otherwise marginal cuisine. So glad they are here!"}
{"text":"Ok, we went back for NYE. Complete fail. My steak was overdone - TWICE - dry, hard-to-cut overdone. My wife's $27 osso buco had like three bites combined! I wouldn't mind the price if there was actually meat. There's more meat on a McDonald's hamburger than was in that dish. We all ate the shrimp appetizer and we all had major stomach problems when we got home. The main courses came out while we were still eating our salad. And the waitress seemed she was way overworked and kept ignoring our table. Water ran out and never got refilled. Heck, On Tap has better tasting food and service. Felt completely robbed, like all they wanted to do was maximize their profits at the expense of patrons. Will definitely not be going back here!"}
{"text":"It was a fun time! The food was pretty good. There were six of us and we each tried each other's dishes. I would definitely recommend the lobster Mac & cheese and the meat & cheese tray. We also got the Pork chop, short rib pasta & the bacon & Brussel sprouts. My friends said they had a good wine selection as well."}
{"text":"Bistro is a solid restaurant. Never disappointed. Had their take on Chicken Parm....very good."}
{"text":"The food was excellent & service outstanding. The chef was accommodating about my dietary restrictions. The waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu offerings. I had scallops which were done perfectly (they can easily be overcooked). We liked that they offer special cocktails at $5 up until 6pm The only downside was the sound system - the music was scratchy & annoying. The waiter turned off the speakers in our area but we could still hear it."}
{"text":"After reading several reviews, I thought me and my family would visit this food establishment, we first were greeted by a very dry hottest, we were seated but waited 10 min, just to be greeted by a server.  The server and the cooks were excellent!  I suggest you take a visit it is well worth the trip."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner on a Friday night. Even though they were busy, we were able to be seated right away. The restaurant is very large, full bar, the only downside is that is is very loud. The menu looks very tasty and they were also featuring a four course corn menu. Our server was very friendly and knowledgeable and the service was outstanding.   We started with some appetizers, the Medjool  dates (local chorizo, bacon wrapped and piquillo coulis). They were outstanding, it had a great contrast between the sweet from the dates and the spicy from the chorizo. Next was the pork belly (peach glaze, horseradish speatzle, citrus soy sauce, cucumber and cilantro). The combination of flavors worked well together, the only problem for me was the pork belly was dry and over cooked. We also tried their special of crawfish poutine w/fried egg. Executed perfectly, and a fried egg makes everything better. The  Roasted asparagus (burrata, prosciutto, croutons and miso butter). The asparagus were cooked perfectly and I loved the combo of the salty prosciutto and the creaminess of the burrata.   Next we decided to try the September four course feature of corn. Course 1 was (corn and shrimp salad, coconut milk dressing, curry corn galette and corn shoots). The creaminess of the dressing complemented the shrimp and corn perfectly. Not really sure how I felt about the texture of the Galette. Course 2 (Tamale, chorizo, cheese and corn relish). This dish was spectacular. All the flavors worked perfectly together and I think the blue corn masa made all the difference. Course 3 (corn bread, bread pudding, cream corn, scallops and bacon jam). The cream corn was nice, and the corn bread bread pudding hybrid was cool, the sad part was the scallops were undercooked. Course 4 (corn pudding, corn crumbs, corn ice cream and poached nectarines). The pudding and corn ice cream were out of sight, I did not care for the poached nectarine, it was a little too tart. Overall we had a great experience and will definitely return."}
{"text":"Been here once.  Excellent food, good service, really nice atmosphere.  Little pricey for what you get, but you have to pay for the ambiance."}
{"text":"Clean, simple, yet elegent ambiance. Brunch menu was nicely varied and creative. Definitely will be back for dinner."}
{"text":"Our friends have been to 111 Bistro several times and we recently met them for the first time.  We studied the online menu prior to our dinner reservation and were disappointed at the steak choices (my husband and I like thick cut, rare steaks).  The menu showed a hanger steak as the main cut of beef.  Hmm...  We met our party at the bar for an apertif.  The bartender was making a jalapeño margarita which was amazing!!!  The bartender was extremely knowledgeable about mixers and alcohol!  The wine list was impressive and I ordered a red blend.  Hubby ordered a draught beer.    We were promptly seated at a table for six (6) in the front (bay) window - an off-shoot of the bar area.  As a result serving dishes/plates were passed around by the patrons rather than the waitstaff who couldn't fit around the table.  Our waitress was totally unaware of normal dining etiquette.  Our entire table was NOT ready to order when she began taking orders for appetizers.  Many of us needed drink refills prior to the appetizer orders.  She skipped some of us because we weren't ready and had to circle back.  Empty glasses were left at an already crowded table.  Sadly, there was limited room for our appetizers when they were served.  The Date appetizer was delicious, the Charcuterie Tray was lacking for a table of six.  We were asked for our main order twice before we completed eating our appetizers... we sent our waitress away until we were ready.  I felt rushed by the service.  The main courses were served as ordered however they were served before the salads were finished (which resulted in diners shuffling their plates to accommodate the too-early main courses).  This basically disrupts the meal and causes a diner to feel rushed.  The table was already too small for six adults, appetizers, drinks, uncleared dishes/glasses... why add more detritus to the mix?  My husband loved his lamb shank (so did I!) but my hanger steak was sliced (like a tenderloin) and, though prepared kind-of-rare, was disappointing.  I want a steak!  I want a Fred Flinstone giant, overhanging my plate, dragging on the table, juices streaming, take-the-rest-of-me-home, cut of beef that makes my husband weep when he opens our refrigerator door the next morning.  What I got was a sliced, medium rare, rough-cut steak that one would expect to be served at a hibachi grill.  For dessert I asked for a decaf coffee with a shot of Frangelica on the side.  I received a cup of coffee with cream, sugar and Frangelica mixed in.  I wanted the coffee and Frangelica separate - why mix them together?  I was unhappy with the food and service here but we loved the company!  We will only go back if we are meeting friends."}
{"text":"Went on a Tuesday night recently. The food is very good with great presentation. Service was great and sincere, a big deal for me. We all had different dishes and everyone liked what they got.   A great restaurant you must try."}
{"text":"Always good. They have several changing draft beer selections. The 111 Burger & 111 fries are always a good pick. The Bahn mi is also fantastic"}
{"text":"I've been here before for dinner and absolutely loved it, but their Easter Sunday brunch buffet was super disappointing. When I made the reservation a week prior, the website did not say brunch buffet, but rather their regular brunch menu. Then the day before it changed to the brunch buffet. Normally, this restaurant is very vegetarian friendly, which was definitely not the case for the buffet. If you like plenty of meat options, then this is for you because there was like 6 different meat options, but the options that were vegetarian were not only limited, but poor quality. Also the dessert was awful and tasted pre-bought and fake. Really disappointing visit to the restaurant and not worth the price. Only thing keeping it at 3 stars is the previous experience."}
{"text":"A new restaurant in the Medina, Ohio area. I went there about a month ago. Had the Tomato Basil Soup, the Hand cut fries, and the Lamb Bolognese.  I thought it was pretty good.  Happen to know Anthony (Bar Manager) from a previous restaurant. I told my wife about the place so we ventured back 3 weeks later.  I insisted she order the Tomato Basil Soup, we did, they neglected to put Sherry in it. It was very bland. We ordered a Pizza, they brought it out burned, had to remake a new one. The salad was very lack luster for having  homemade dressing, and we were not impressed with the $19.00 Chicken.  But worst of all the place was half empty and the noise level was extremely loud.  As Janice K. said the parking lot was packed, mainly because of On Tap another restaurant that also just moved to this shopping plaza from across the street.  We may try it again but it will be awhile before we go back."}
{"text":"My first visit to 111 Bistro was awhile back. The wife and I had brunch with her parents. It was an experience that I failed to Yelp. I don't know why. Life got in the way. More important things. Insert the excuse of the day here. Suffice it to say that our inaugural experience was such that it had us immediately adding it to our \"gotta get back there sometime\" list. As we were fairly early in the day I didn't partake of any adult beverages - they've got a nice little draught list btw - their menu was loaded with memorable dishes.   For starters, 111 Bistro is tucked away in a typical everywhere America strip mall. There's definitely a trend of fancy little eateries popping up in places like this and I'm a fan. The space is quite large and very open and well-lit. There's a sizeable bar with 16 taps of mostly regional craft brews. Toward the back is the little open kitchen where the magic happens and around the corner and to the right is a much larger dining area. The decor is right out of the bistro handbook - exposed brick and ductwork, wood paneling, oversized wooden utensils on the wall, deep red/black color scheme. Sure, it's a bit commonplace, but that's probably because it works.  The service on both of our visits was very good. Our servers were clearly both well-versed in the menu selections as well as the beers on tap. Both offered helpful commentary and recommendations and both managed to keep waters full and empty plates cleared. For me, I like a server that's able to be both present and invisible at the same time. I don't really want to notice them doing their jobs.  Sure, it's pricey, but it's also hand-crafted, full of \"house-made\" this and that, and not mass-produced garbage. I happily plop down the bucks in places like this because I want them to be successful. Want a $5 burger? You've got plenty of options.  Here's a run-down of my brunchies:  Breakfast Flatbread - Simply delicious. A crispy flatbread topped with scrambled eggs, bacon, Yukon Gold potato hash, gouda, a drizzle of buttermilk bleu ranch & a sprinkling of chives. I'd order it again in a heartbeat.  Duck Bratwurst Scotch Egg - A different take on the classic. A soft-boiled egg enrobed in house-made duck sausage and baked instead of fried. Perfectly seasoned, runny, yolky goodness. The pickled onions and mustard a nice accompaniment.  Breakfast Sandwich - A super-soft everything bagel around some house-cured smoked bacon, a perfectly cooked fried & folded egg, a slice of smoked Gouda cheese and arugula. So damn fresh I wanted to smack it.  Squash & Apple Soup - I wasn't blown away by this. Found it a bit thick, more a puree than a soup. Nice roasted squash & apple flavor and the crunch of the pepitas was a nice touch.  Visit #2:  Flatbread - Even better than the breakfast version. Cider braised pork cheek, caramelized onions, garlic and herbs, apple, sherry drizzle, yellow house bleu cheese. I wanted a bowl of those pork cheeks. Easily among the best I've had.  Greens Salad - A tasty little number with fresh greens, dried cranberries, celery, pepitas, grilled cauliflower, pear ginger vinaigrette. I could have done without the rubbery, undercooked cauliflower and there's just something about celery that's so overpowering in a salad.  Caesar Salad - A solid take on the classic. A little heart of romaine lettuce, some croutons (out of a bag?) drizzled with dressing. The Parmesan tuile was a crunch little tidbit.  Smoked Bison Meatloaf - Nice flavor - the hint of smokiness was delightful - but just didn't live up to me expectations. The whole baby carrots were cooked well, fork tender, but I thought the meatloaf had a strange texture. It was very crumbly and slightly dry. Maybe it lacked binder. The cauliflower au gratin was a pleasant surprise. Like a slightly healthier mac and cheese.  72-Hour Short Rib - The meat was ridiculously tender and the flavor was rich, unctuous and meaty. The Zinfandel-sous vide added a depth of flavor I've not had in other short rib dishes. The mustard spaetzel was a bit dry and over-cooked and the roasted root vegetables coverd in red wine reduction looked like a crime scene. Perhaps a green veg like brussels or asparagus would have been better than doubling up on the starch.  Caramel Cheesecake - Rich, velvety, cheesecake so dense it had to be a Trump supporter topped with caramel sauce and served with a dollop of house-made vanilla bean whipped cream and a crunchy bit of peanut brittle. Pretty damn tasty.  There's a special place in my heart for places like 111 Bistro. Small, family-owned, local, purveyors of dishes made with love, attention to detail and fresh ingredients. What's not to like? Sure, you'll drop a C-note on dinner, but no one ever laid on their deathbed rattling out the words, \"If only I'd gone to more cheap, shitty restaurants.\""}
{"text":"My wife and I were late on making reservations for valentines day.  Most places were booked solid.  We called 111 Bistro hoping for anything.  The hostess told us they were book for that night, but offer to squeeze us in.  We said sure and hoped to not be waiting in the snow for hours.  When we arrived we were greeted by three staff members all who were smiling and and dare I say happy to be there.  Before I could even get my coat off they were ready to escort us to our table.  WOW, did not expect that with a last minute reservation on a very busy night.  The atmosphere was nice, a little dark, but I think that added to the experience.  I wasn't sure what to expect being part of a strip mall, but the decor was nice, plenty of room (I hate when tables are smashed together), and clean!  Within only a few minutes our waitress came to us with a smile to give us some specials and take a drink order.  She gave a run down of beers on tap and gave a recommendation of an IPA I had not had before.  Very good recommendation too, great stuff.  We ordered an appetizer of seared ahi tuna. I love seared tuna!  It was done just right and arrived at our table in only about 5 minutes as did our drinks.  Not long after our salads came out.  It's their house salad with cheese shavings and a very tasty house dressing.  Finally the main course.  Being valentines day we got their surf and turf special they had just for the night.  20 oz  steak and shrimp.  The steak was done medium and it was just that, medium.  Having a restaurant that serves steak and know how to truly prepare it seems to be a rarity.  Great job there 111!  The shrimp we received were honestly some of the biggest I've ever had.  Like the steak they were cooked perfectly.  If the kitchen staff ever sees this review; bravo, job well done.  We finished up with a desert that was amazing, their special cheesecake for the night.  I should add too, while we were eating the waitress was attentive to check back on drinks and our food even though you could tell she was quite busy.  The manager was also actively engaged speaking with customers about their meals.  Friendliness goes a log way with me and 111 had that all around.  Two thumbs up and five stars 111 Bistro!  Way to go!"}
{"text":"Great selection of unique dishes. We got the Waygu steak and the Chicken \"Parmesan\"; both were amazing. We also enjoyed the Chocolate Lava Cake for dessert. Michelle was an awesome and knowledgeable server. We will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my experience at 111 Bistro.  I went over a year ago, but the experience still stands out in memory. Our party of four was treated exceptionally well.  Then again, I'm a sucker for servers who are willing to engage in witty exchanges, which was most certainly the case.  If you're engaging, receptive, and willing to put up with my personality, you're automatically going to get a good review from me.   The drinks were spectacular. I had a great Moscow Mule, which was chased by the best Sazerac that I've had in years.  It was so good that I asked for a refill.  (Yes, they charge for Sazerac refills. Please work on that, management.) The rest of the group was also very satisfied by their drink choices.  My wife got the pork chop, which was an absolute star.  It was thick cut, juicy, and succulent. I was in a strange mood, and I ordered the duck. I'm opposed to eating duck because they're amazingly friendly animals and I dig their personalities. However, I saw the duck being delivered to a table on the way in and it looked way too good to pass up.  Great choice. Cooked to perfection, and completely meaty and delicious. The demi and juices made me want to lick the plate.  (I didn't.) I also tell myself that the duck I ate was a straight up jerk. It's a beautiful lie that I tell myself...  111 Bistro is marked for a revisit soon.  It's not on the radar of many people, but it's a short trip from Cleveland and it's right off of I-71.  Get away from the hustle and bustle without sacrificing good food."}
{"text":"Very good food. Lots homemade on sight and locally sourced. Slow service, but it was extremely busy. Reasonably priced."}
{"text":"This place is very good, Food was great , atmosphere is grest , small lil place ,brought water out to us in a fancy bottle,  had drinks apps Annie desert..plate portions were very good!"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try 111 again. We weren't very impressed the first time! We love the atmosphere, but the service, food, and prices are nothing to write home about. We were just as unhappy this time as we were the first!  We will not be returning and I will not encourage my friends or family to try it either!"}
{"text":"As a first time customer here I have to say that I was highly impressed! Everything was amazing! I highly recommend the meat and cheese board for an appetizer. I got the chicken parmesan for dinner and the risotto with it was perfectly made. For dessert I got the bread pudding which also was excellent. If your looking for highly quality food I recommend going here, you will not be disappointed at all!"}
{"text":"We have been going to Bistro since it opened.  I've never been disappointed!  The atmosphere is delightful and the food is even better!  The service never disappoints!  So glad we have Chef Anthony and Megan in Medina.  We are so lucky!"}
{"text":"Our party of 4 had one who was gluten-intolerant.  The menu offered several entrees for her.  Each of us had a different entree: burger, grilled salmon, beef short ribs, & scampi/clams over pasta (homemade pasta :-), always a treat!!).   Each person gave high marks for their food.  Friendly servers and all our food was served hot.  Decent beer menu as well as cocktails. Book reservations for Saturdays."}
{"text":"The server was very kind and accommodating. She was also very slow. Painfully slow. The food was bland, every dish.  I had to send my salmon back, somehow absolutely tasteless with undercooked potatoes and Brussel sprouts and tasteless. Had purchased the tasting menu and after having been at the restaurant for an incredibly long time, requested to take our dessert home. Terrible idea! They dumped the creme brûlée into a plastic container, it looks like a pile of vomit and I am not going to eat it. Total waste of time and money."}
{"text":"So happy to finally come across a place in Medina that actually has good food/service!  If the people in Medina don't appreciate this place, come to Cleveland!    Upon driving up to this place, it looks smallish w/limited seating.  However, it opens up in the back with way more tables.  Clean and stylish!  I'm impressed w/how good the hallway and bathrooms smell too!     Servers all seem nice.  Now onto the food!  App- Duck wings were yummy!  Entrees- all excellent!! lobster mac. Roasted chix. The sausage stuffed quail was good, but my hubby got that and of course he said it wasn't enough to fill him up.. Now although these were all very good, my absolute favorite was the beef short rib!!!! Oh- my-gawd fantastic!    And the dessert... Brownie sundae was the bomb!!  House made brownie/banana cream and the peanut butter ice cream - ah-mazing!!!!!  A new favorite place for sure!!"}
{"text":"first day out for the newest  Medinut creation and my wife needed to be there to get it !!!!. got one took it home to have with a nice homemade latte and  she said it was great !!!!!"}
{"text":"While we have dined at One Eleven Bistro several times this was the last. The food is great but the service continues to deteriorate. For example my husband ordered a split of Perrier and was brought a Pellegrino. Not even close. When we asked our waitress what the specials were she didn't know if there were any. Unfortunately our previous visit the service was even worse.This lack of \"service\" is reason enough to look elsewhere."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise as I opened the door from the outside! I was not expecting the great atmosphere and cozy environment that welcomed me! Being quickly seated I was presented with the menu of adult beverages and goodies from the menu. Wine in hand, I decided to get the appetizer of fries and aioli sauce and the portion was generous! As I approached the end of my last frenchy, a nicely organized dish of Mac and cheese sprinkled with labstah adorned my table. I ate the whole damn thing. WOOFTAH! It was super good, but what really delighted my pallet was the three scoops of ice cream, carrot cake, maple walnut, and coffee, they was promptly scarfed down like a rabid dog!   Drop in and see Michelle and these fine folks who are sure to leave you satisfied with culinary delight!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast this morning. I had steak and eggs with bacon and Yukon hash browns. I substituted a lemon pancake for the english muffin. This establishment does breakfast well. Everything was cooked perfectly. The steak was very delicious. They have several vegan options as well.   Kayleigh was an excellent server. Very knowledgeable and helpful.   On the wall they have a chalk board with all of their draft beer options. I am going to have to stop back for dinner and try some of the beer. Great place with a lot of options."}
{"text":"First time at 111 Bistro, recently moved to the area.  Service was great, food was good.  I ordered the scallops small plate- disappointment was they are NOT sea scallops i am used to. 4-5 small scallops, no sweetness as expected.  You dont get salads with your dinner, and brought rolls after our salads were done?  Will give them another try as my party enjoyed the food they ordered, but pricey without including a salad."}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend yesterday as he read that it's a great spot for brunch. I was excited! The ambiance was really cool. Good lighting and contemporary music were definitely a plus. The server was attentive and friendly. We both ordered coffee and it came out on a napkin covered saucer, which made us feel fancy. But, when she brought the creamer, it was a bowl of hazelnut and French vanilla International Delight pre-packaged singletons. Not a huge deal but I was thinking it seemed incongruent with the thought put into the presentation of the coffee. The coffee was wonderful and the server really stayed on top of making sure we had enough throughout our meal. I ordered scrambled eggs with home fries, English muffin, and sausage links. It was my first time, and the traditional breakfast is how I like to measure a place up.  The scrambled eggs were way too salty, but cooked properly. The home fries tasted like they were underneath a lamp for the past two hours dying of heat exhaustion until they hit my plate. The English muffin consisted of three half-moon shaped pieces of a pitiful flour/water mixture that someone must have found in the depths of the bread warmer. I've had saltines better than that! Lastly, the sausages were way underdone and lacked a good, snappy sear.   Normally, with that many things going haywire on one plate, I would understand someone sending it back. But, I know the ultimate hell fire that is being a server and dealing with explaining everything to the back of the house during a rush.   My boyfriend's Chicken and Waffles were spectacular. We also had some mimosas and they were wonderfully balanced. The one bite I had of his meal along with the delicious drinks are the only things that would make me want to try this place out again."}
{"text":"My husband and I were here for our anniversary dinner last night, we chose this restaurant based on a four star review from the Plain Dealer, 4 stars are hard to come by so we thought we were in for a stellar meal.  We normally love dining out in Tremont, Ohio City or the fabulous restaurants downtown.  So based on the newspapers review and other reviews we thought there was a gem hidden in a strip mall.   First off from cocktails to dessert it was one of the fastest meals we've ever had,  just over an hour.  I would have liked a bit more time to linger over each course and sip more of my cocktail or order another glass of wine with my meal.    Our cocktails were good, my husband had an old fashioned and I had a Paloma, which was a tequila concoction, it was both citrusy and refreshing with a bit of fiz that tickled the tastebuds.    When it came time to pick our appetizers and meals , we were told right off the bat that they were already out of three menu items.  How do you run out of anything right at the start of dinner service on a Saturday night?  Also no specials for the evening because they were switching to their fall menu the following week.  My husband actually called another of our favorite restaurants while we were sitting there to see if they had any availability, we were contemplating leaving after hearing they were already running out of menu items, No such luck,no reservations available.  I was determined our meals we picked would be great.    Our appetizer was the pork belly with  Peach glaze, horseradish spaetzle, citrus soy sauce, cucumber and cilantro.  Honestly other then the pork belly being cooked well, creamy and succulent on the inside and a good sear on the outside. We picked up on none of these other flavors, the spaetzle were ok but I didn't get any horseradish flavor or cilantro.  There was barely any sauce on the plate at all.  Pork belly needs a good acidic garnish to cut all the yummy fat, it just wasn't there.  Good but not great.   I had the scallops over black garlicky lentils and Avacado crema.  The scallops were cooked perfectly and I could have eaten a huge bowl of just the lentils, the star of the dish were the lentils, they had the most flavor. My meal was good but it could have used a pinch more salt and seasoning  over all, again good but not great.   My husband had the seared snapper with  Ohio valley jerk seasoning, trinity cous cous, pineapple salsa, green beans and crema.  His meal was lacking seasoning overall, everything just needed more punch to it, a pinch  more salt a bit more acid in the salsa, that would have taken the plate to the next level.   I had a coffee, where they forgot the sugar and served creamer in those little disposable cups that you find at a diner.  Also a caramel cheesecake.  The cheesecake was light and fluffy and the combo of the sea salt with the rich caramel was perfect.   This was a good dining experience, but not worthy of four stars.  Overall the food was just ok, nearly everything was lacking seasoning, it just all needed a bit more flavor, more punch.  We won't be returning, I'm not saying this is a bad restaurant, but I'm just not sure it's worthy of all the hype. Just my humble foodie opinion."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!  I had to ask the server what to choose because everything seemed so good!  I had the flatbread and some squash and apple soup. They were BOTH fantastic. I can't wait to come back and try some more!  The atmosphere was relaxed, the service wonderful and the food impeccable."}
{"text":"This was our first visit. Drinks were well done. Nice selection of draft beers. The menu had a wide variety of options. I had the lamb bolognese which was tasty and my wife's salmon was nicely done as well. The bar crowd was vibrant and filled with the 40-50 something types which works for me. We'll go back for sure."}
{"text":"I thought this place was suppose to be really good I walk in and no one says hi so I walk to a booth on my own and there we're still plates on he table. The food that was on the plate did not not look good so I tried a piece of bread and it was stale like my mother boyfriend. Then I clapped loudly twice for some service but accidentally turn off the lights and it was pitch black. Sorry but this place is irrelevant now that I wrote this review #yucky"}
{"text":"The 72-hour short ribs were a savory, fork-split revelation.  The dark jus mixed with the mustard spaetzle to make for a lovely base.  I asked if I could get something other than roasted root vegetables, and they gave me parmesan \"barrotto\" (a risotto from barley), which outshone even the spaetzle.  I wanted a little of everything in each bite, and left absolutely nothing on the plate.  We came to 111 to celebrate a little, and my meal was worthy of the special occasion."}
{"text":"Stopped in for an early dinner. The food was wonderful, gnocchi was a work of art., and the Old Fashioned was right on."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite restaurant in Medina County. From start to finish the experiment is incredible. The food is amazing, the staff is knowledgeable and friendly, and the atmosphere is inviting. I have had the Chicken and Waffles, the Lobster Mac and Cheese, the bacon wrapped dates, and many other items and they are all amazing. Their special menus and events are not to be missed."}
{"text":"Nice ambience.  Food was very good. The burger was juicy, scallops came with a pasta that had a pretty neat kind of sweet sauce. Chef's whim vegan dish was great with winter veggies and lentils. It was super great to have a vegan option right in the menu"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat.  The food is always top notch, consistently good, and reasonably priced.  Sunday brunch is fantastic; the lemon ricotta pancakes are amazing.  Chicken and waffles are good too.  Their daily menu items are also delicious.  My favorite (at the moment) is the seared scallops.  Large beverage selection with excellent choices of wine.  A nice casual atmosphere but still feels somewhat upscale.  Excellent location, just off of 71 in Medina.  I really like this place and would recommend it to anyone living on or driving through the area."}
{"text":"We tried their Sunday brunch and it was nothing short of spectacular. The best chicken and waffles I've ever had no doubt. The service was amazing and the atmosphere was incredible, very warm and inviting. The chef/owner, Anthony even came by to say hi and introduced himself, definitely made us feel welcomed. What an amazing experience. Can't wait to try dinner soon."}
{"text":"This is the kind of restaurant a Yelper dreams of finding.  Not one to venture too far from my little corner of Westlake these days, boyfriend and I sort of stumbled upon this place by accident while driving by one Sunday and decided to brunch. Needless to say, we were so dazzled by the place that we were back within the month for a beer tasting dinner that took place last night. I was just about tickled pink by the whole experience. The owners were SO engaged, and SO involved, the event went off (mostly) without a hitch, it was reasonably priced, delicious, interesting, and a true treat for the tastebuds.   Try as I might, I can't think of anything wrong with this place. The service has been great on both visits, the menu is inventive and refreshing, and the ambiance is just super cool and sexy. I guarantee boyfriend and I will be making the 35-minute trek back here within the summer, it was just that great."}
{"text":"I don't give many 5-star reviews but 111 Bistro deserves it. Had a great Sunday Brunch here this morning with my family. Very courteous wait staff, well prepared plates, good portions.  The last time we were here was in May for our anniversary dinner and we remain impressed.We will be coming back again!"}
{"text":"After reading several good reviews, we decided to check out 111 Bistro.  Although it sits in a shopping center, it's actually really cute inside. The hostess was very welcoming, we decided to sit at the bar and the bartender was very polite and attentive. It wasn't terribly busy, but there was a little crowd. My fiancé ordered the steak pasta, which by description sounded delicious. It was good, but the Marsala cream sauce was a little overwhelming without allowing any other flavors to come through and the steak was a little tough. It was a great concept, but I believe it could be elevated with a few changes. I ordered the fish special. I took off half of the fish when removing the skin. It was Walleye, it was very light, again without a lot of flavor. It was cooked perfectly, just missing something. It came with colored potatoes and these green bean like things that were actually pretty delicious, just a bit saltier than a green bean and thinner. They had a decent beer selection and the bartender definitely seemed to know what he was talking about in means of the drinks and menu. Probably would not eat here again, but would happily enjoy stopping in for a drink!"}
{"text":"Myself and three of my lady friends had dinner last night. Parking is terrible but that is not One Eleven Bistros fault. I was very disappointed in my wedge salad that was just a half head of lettuce cut in half put on a plate with very little dressing and very little taste. The mussels were very weird tasting and would never order again.  My friends dinners were just so so for a very expensive cost. The service was good except our waitress had difficulty with our checks and giving back the correct change.  Would not recommend this place at this time.  Maybe in the future the food will be better."}
{"text":"Chef Anthony and crew have taken an outstanding dining experience and elevated it.  The new menu is outstanding.  The wine list is amazing.  No matter how many times you have dined at 111 you need to experience the new menu.  My compliments to Taylor at the hostess stand - she is a professional."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! Have been wanting to try this place for over a year now and we finally made it and it did not disappoint! I had the paprikash and hubby had the meatloaf, we were scraping our plates. The house cab/Merlot wine was really good and of course I couldn't pass up the creme brûlée - yum!!!! Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic!  The 72 hour short rib was amazing.  Get it!  The atmosphere, service and food was great.  Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"My wife's birthday was October 20th and wanted to take her to a nice dinner. Made reservations for 630pm  and was seated promptly.  We sat and waited at least 10 minutes before the wait staff to even bring us water and take our drink orders and appetizers. Some time passes before he returns and takes the main course order. I order the special seafood dish and my wife orders the hanger steak.  Once again time passes and our drinks are gone so is the French onion soup.  After waiting forever, i asked the waiter to check on our food and they finally served it to us. The seafood special was just OK, the hangar steak was tough. The service was poor. We left at 830pm, 2 hours later, very dissatisfied."}
{"text":"Five of us had dinner at 111 Bistro tonight as our socks were knocked off on our last visit. Tonight's visit was very good, but not quite as good as last time. Tonight, I ordered beef tacos and shrimp ratatouille. I definitely liked the beef tacos. They were very tasty with a hint of lime. The ratatouille was tasty, but the shrimp was lacking flavor.  I tasted my father-in-law's pork ribs and it was pretty tasty too. Our server was excellent. I tasted a couple different draft beers, but I couldn't find one that I loved. I settled on a mix of wine and beer called \"mixed media\". It was okay, if not a little sweet.  We'll be back to try other items as them menu is always changing."}
{"text":"I travel across the country for my profession and I constantly use Yelp to find amazing places to eat.  111 Bistro is definitely worth the star rating.  From ambiance to drinks to food items, it is top notch.  Pricing is on par with the quality of the food items.  Staff very friendly and engaging."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went out for our anniversary and were exited to see a place in Medina with 4.5 stars. We were so disappointed by her non-flavored steak, garlic ball twice baked potatoes, which we sent back. My duck was chewy and salty, the risotto had huge chunks of onions. The server was never there and when my girlfriend addressed this, he stated I've been here plenty then walked away. Won't be back and I would not recommend to anyone in Medina or arround. Walked next door for ontap food with better service. If you want a good meal in Medina go to Thyme, Brown Derby or Lager and Vine, not here!"}
{"text":"I had dinner there for the first time last night it was ok menu could have had more Choice for vegetarians, very salty foot. I would go again some time, so watch this space for the next comment."}
