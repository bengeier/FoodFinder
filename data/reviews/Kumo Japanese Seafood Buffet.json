{"text":"I have got to say, Kumo offers quite an extensive buffet menu and it is so cheap! $12 for lunch and $16 for dinner. Sushi buffets in Boston are upward of $30 for dinner, though that comes with higher quality. 

As far as the food goes, I tried quite a few of the items:
- Sushi: not bad but not great. The pieces were very small and the quantity/quality of fish was sub par. However, they did have sashimi so I loaded up on that. Bonus points for the amount of rolls that they offer. 

- Seafood: Pretty good. They had clams, raw oysters, cooked oysters, king crab legs, shrimp, mussels, etc. Loved the mussels. Also, raw oysters at a buffet? Sign me up. 

- Chinese: Pretty good.. not the best but still tastes good. Assorted meat/veggie dishes. They also have Americanized Chinese, didn't have any but that's probably standard. 

- Udon bar: didn't have any but some of my relatives went back for seconds so I'm assuming that it tasted good. 

- Desserts: assorted fruits, mini cakes, ice cream, crepes, as well as other items like tapioca soup w/ sweet potato. The crepes didn't look that good but props for the variety. 

- Salad bar: it's tucked away with the desserts so I didn't see it until the end of the meal. Wish I saw it sooner.. love seaweed salads! 

Overall, seems like a good value, especially at those prices. However, I'm not from the area so I don't really have anything to compare it to."}
{"text":"Kumo has to be the best Asian buffet in Northeast Ohio, and you'll find it attracts a lot of Asian families, which is always a good sign.  It's clean, the food is good quality and it's a pleasant setting. We had been partial to Watami, which is also pretty good, but it doesn't have half the selection and variety of Kumo.

They have a good sized sushi buffet, a tepanyaki station, a crepe station, a Mongolian bbq grill, and three islands of chinesey/japanesy type foods.

The ambiance is pretty institutional with touches that show the owner is trying to create a feel of class, but not fully achieving it ... for example, the coin operated crane game in the entryway. That's fine, however, because how classy can a buffet be? We're not talking about a Michelin star sort of place.

The sushi bar offers probably about 20 types of rolls and nigiri, and they also have things like marinated octopus, seaweed salad, kimchee, and other Asian favorites.

There are three large buffet steam tables, with all the usual Chinese-American suspects: General Tso's chicken, broccoli beef, hot & sour soup, chow mein, etc. They also include the obligatory not-so-Asian fare that seem to be in every Chinese buffet in Ohio, like fried chicken wings, crab legs, fried fish, etc.

Desert is nothing special, a number of small cakes, sliced fruit and a variety of ice creams.

Okay, so you're not going to be bowled away by the food, but there's a good chance you'll enjoy what you select, and if you leave hungry that's more of a statement about you than Kumo. And at $7.99 for lunch from Mondy - Saturday, it's well worth a visit."}
{"text":"Pretty good, exceeded expectations. The food is hit or miss, but most buffets are. You just have to be smart with your selections. I would return. The fresher the better."}
{"text":"This is the best buffet, I have had the pleasure of experiencing. The food selection is great, expecially the seafood. There are a variety of meats and dishes. The soup bar and sushi was delicous. It was real food, not mediocre plate fillers most buffets carry. I can't stop praising every aspect of my visit. The staff were friendly and didn't hassle guests. They cleared the plates quickly and didn't hover but were there when you needed them. It got pretty busy which is a mark of good establishment. There were plenty of seating and privacy booths. I'll go again with family and friends."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places for Japanese Buffet...sushi is pretty good too!!!  Seems like the prices went up a bit.  2 dinners, 1 child and 2 drinks was about $38.00"}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting. General Tsos Chicken was horrendous. Just very, very gross. Chicken had no flavor and was very squishy and rubbery. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Terrible. Went in for the subpar lunch special before 3pm. Some food was burnt, being all of the crab rangoon, and some food was undercooked, being sweet and sour chicken. So I didn't even eat a quarter of my plate while the rest of the party continued eating. I was given a bill and they refused to do anything about it."}
{"text":"This place is gross... The food was cold and dry.. It's pricier than most buffets and that would be fine if it was better than most buffets but it's below. They didn't have a huge selection."}
{"text":"Just A chinese buffet!!!!!

Lady chef in sushi area serves only to white Americans for sashimi. Not a good emplye manner. Overall, foods are not displayed in clean condition. Food inspection needs to come by soon.
They also never filled in oysters."}
{"text":"i have been several times recently for both lunch and dinner and each time i have been so impressed with what they offer for the price!  buffets usually freak me out a bit but in this case, once you find things that you like you can just keep going after more of it and it really makes it special!  i think i love this place for lunch rather than dinner.  the sushi bar is photo worthy, everything is beautiful and so well presented.  everyone there seems genuinely blown away with the place.  i am not such a seafood fan but everyone who i went to dinner with was very happy with the selections.  this is the place to take an adventurous eater.. two words indicate that- frog legs.  yikes.  made for a memorable occasion.  
if you are going for lunch, look for the sugary donuts on the hot bar.  i wanted to put a dozen in my purse!  fancy little crab rangoons are a little different than what i am used to seeing but twice as good!  some of the sushi looks like candy, so colorful and bright.  i only wish that they were labeled better so i knew what was in each one.  -i lean towards the veggie versions and not the fishy versions.  i bet the staff there would be happy to give me a tour.  fun place!!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I love to \"Andrew Zimmern\" restaurants around town. We loved this place for the sushi and dim sum. We will try just about anything. She liked the chicken feet and I liked the frog legs   Also they have a warm, sweet soup that I have never eaten anywhere else. It was quite good!  There is plenty of food and dinner buffet has a lot of great seafood. We had attentive service, unlike some other reviewers. I say \"GO!\""}
{"text":"Kind of a let down when reading the reviews. Sushi not very impressive (mostly fake crab pieces and even then not much fish) snow crab was small and often out.  The wonton soup was flavorless. What saved it was the stir fry and udon stations. While over all not terrible probably not coming back. PS dinner with soda was 18.88"}
{"text":"We have been coming to Kumo since it has opened the owners are so friendly and the place is very very clean restrooms are  immaculate the food is absolutely fresh and lightly seasoned everything from Sushi ,to Hibachi ,American, Japanese ,Korean, Vietnamese, amazing,come here in the afternoon for the buffet very inexpensive it wouldn't cost you more than $10 , the mirrors in this place have no fingerprints, everything is immaculate. Dinner is just a little bit more expensive but I guarantee you you won't leave hungry! They have everything ,hanging smoked duck, ribs,( I'll be taking photos of the bar) and they have homemade crepes, handmade anything you want ,I'd recommend it .Children are more than welcome, they love this food . The deserts are absolutely exquisite you can't be disappointed in this Adventure, who could write a bad review on Kumo?  It's the best kept secret here in Parma located on Snow Road in Snow View Plaza. Yes we will be back again and again."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I came here upon recommendation from a coworker. SUPER IMPRESSED! There's a bunch of different kinds of sushi which you can tell are freshly prepared, not only that but they have a great dessert selection, as well as other food choices such as chicken, egg rolls, fries and I was pleasantly surprised to see crawfish which my friend enjoyed :) Definitely will be back here, all you can eat buffet for only $16.19. The waitresses were also very attentive! Very relaxing atmosphere and close to home."}
{"text":"I see I'm greatly outnumbered here, but I didn't enjoy my experience here at all. Admittedly, I'm not a big buffet fan, and Kumo did little to change that. I am a big sushi fan however, but theirs was just bad. It was gummy and chewy, probably from sitting out, although I was there early for lunch. The crab dishes were all fake crab and there were no crab legs when I was there. The rest of the food was pretty much average Chinese fried dishes, mostly battered chicken with overcooked veggies. There were a few things that were pretty good, although by the time I put  a variety on my plate, it was hard to distinguish one from another. I didn't realize until later that they had a station towards the back where you can choose your meat and vegetables, and they cook it on the spot. This probably would have been a better option.
If you are a big Asian buffet fan, Kumo is probably better than most but I must admit, I was glad I was at a buffet when I saw the waiter leave the bathroom without washing his hands!"}
{"text":"I love a good buffet and was excited to visit Kumo for dinner during a recent visit to Cleveland, but I was disappointed with the food quality overall. The sushi was dried out, and a number of dishes just weren't very good. On the other hand, a number of hot dishes were very good, and I had a nice dinner after I figured out which things were fit to eat. I was there on a Tuesday night, which is admittedly one of the worst times to try a buffet; it's always better to go when they're crowded like a Friday or Saturday night. I'll try to do so if I'm there on a weekend and update my review then."}
{"text":"Awesome food selection,  great service,  no waiting.  Everything tonight was great! Duck,  ribs,  pho, stir fry,  too many things to choose from! I have been here before,  but the selection has become more vast....."}
{"text":"We moved from the area, but Kumo was our favorite dinner buffet ever! Oh how I miss you ! My all time fav frog legs and the soft shell crab and sushi was good too! Sundays we went with friends and she guys always enjoyed the dim sum !"}
{"text":"This kumo was the second one they recently opened on strongsville. It is very clean and always friendly. We expected it to be this good when just opening because they need to build a good status here. The sushi at the other kumo was not the best, but here was much better and the salmon was delicious. Everything was hot and the clams are a must!! Our favorite part is always the crepes and ice cream at the end. We tried everything and nothing was bad. Buffet is 14.99 but have a nice promotion from 4/23 for a couple days for 12.99 with steak and lobster."}
{"text":"3 stars for damn services. Servers talking on the phone while we were waiting front the door. The one served us looked like we owe her great deal of money. Two servers talked loudly and we can hear what they are discussing, which is really annoying. 
Moreover, she treated Americans with big smile and warm greetings. How can people from same country be treated like this.
Won't come here again unless bad servers are fired. 
BTW, food is good here compare to others."}
{"text":"I went to their new location in Strongsville,it is very nice  interior decoration ,but is only few table there not busy at all only one satation  is open about 6-8 tables  ,it is around 6:30, food is not hot and fresh ,soup is too salty, $15.00 for adult even 11yrs old    ,7-9 is $7 ,under 7 is $5, for my son is 11 years old pay for $15 for buffet is too much ,only he eat is a plate noodle and chicken broccoli,  Crablegs are on the ice no butter  to provide  . My  total bill is about $70 ,it is not worth, we will not come in back there.very disappointed."}
{"text":"I went there to try the new dim sum that they started to have and was very disappointed. I was disappointed with lots of the food. I always loved chicken with broccoli and I've eaten it at many restaurants before with no problems. But at Kumo, this dish tasted very foul, like I was eating dirt. Tasted like they didn't clean the broccoli and just cooked it as is."}
{"text":"The best Japanese food, it is fresh and delicious!! This is our 3 visit this month...I love this place. It is a gem in Strongsville.  Service is always good! They are in the place behind Taco Bell...can't say enough good things."}
{"text":"I have been going to Kumo for years - its previous name escapes me now. At any rate, a lot of Filipinos I know enjoy going there, my family is no exception. However, over the past year, I noticed a serious decline in the quality of food. 

Sushi never disappoints, it is the rest of the menu that does. I have eaten there for lunch, dinner, & during their dim sum. And, today, was the final straw. My won ton soup was barely warm, the salmon was over done / dry, the hibachi rice was barely cooked (grains were  as hard as the peas), hot tea as barely hot, jumbo shrimps were over cooked, & we saw a server put the fresh crab legs on the buffet with her bare hands. Almost everything I ate was flavorless.

This used to. be a place I would recommend to people. I can't do that any more. It is sad that the dessert (ice cream!l) was the best part of an expensive meal. It wasn't worth the $100 spent on 6 people there.

The next time we need a place.to celebrate something, it won't be there."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple times a month. Service has always been good for me. Love the food ! Plenty of cooked sushi to chose from. MMM, fish ball soup. Hibachi grilled veggies. Whole ginger flounder. Lots of Asian folks eating here too so you know Kumo's doing it right. It's a little more expensive than most buffets but it is worth every cent. Stop reading & get going to Kumo's. Update - since they stopped serving ginger flounder in the buffet I've lost interest in going. I haven't liked the sushi the last two times I went either. I've been back twice now recently May/June, ginger flounder is back at dinner & I'm enjoying the sushi.#1 Asian buffet in town."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times now and we really like it. There is just so much food you could never taste it all in one visit probably not in four visits. My BIL is Japanese so I know great sushi. Their sushi is very good but not great. They have different things on the buffet but I have never seen pigs feet on a buffet but they have them here. They are tasty. They have seaweed salad near the sushi and this has to be my favorite thing there, can't get enough! The service varies from excellent to average depending on who is working. But as most places if you frequent a place and you tip well I think the service is usually better, word gets around. Well I think we'll be planning a trip here again soon. Happy Eating."}
{"text":"Food is fine.but they raised the price every year. Finally. fuji Japanese buffet cross the Street just opened few days ago. We saved like 5 bucks each person for same kind of food."}
{"text":"Eh. We had been going to Fuji but decided to try Kumo. It was a Monday night, not so busy. Sushi seemed to have been sitting out for a while. It seemed dry. It was kinda gross to see so many FOOD service people on their phones while handling food. One waiter used the men's room and didn't wash his hands. Service was good, soups were decent, kids loved the ice cream but they didn't have a lot of kid friendly food compared to Fuji. Don't think I'll go back."}
{"text":"Came here primarily to try out the sushi, but was much more impressed with their other offerings.  They did have a wide selection of sushi, but I didn't think any of their sushi offerings were exceptional.  My favorite part was the extensive soup selection.  I think they had 6 soups on the buffet the night I went, 4 of which I had never tried before.  For me, that was a huge plus!  I would go again."}
{"text":"I am normally not your typical seafood fan. I usually tend to shy away from buffets and seafood restaurants all together. So why you ask would i have gone to eat here? I went based on many recommendations from family and friends. I have to say, upon entering the restaurant, i was impressed by not only the lovely decor, but the overall cleanliness of the restaurant, and the number of patrons as it was the dinner hour. I ordered hot tea, which to my amazement, arrived at my table piping hot. Upon first glance at the buffet tables, i was extremely taken back. Some of the menu items, particularly the seafood and fish entrees, looked a little questionable to me at first. But, overcoming my anxiety, i decided to venture into unknown food territory and i gave it a try. My compliments to the chef on the sweet and sour chicken, the glazed salmon, the pot stickers, dim sum, and the lo mein. I could tell right away these items were indeed homemade. My all time favorite item actually came at the end of the meal with the desserts. If you have never tried green tea ice cream, i highly recommend it. It's not too overly sweet, and it does not leave you thirsty afterwards. The perfect compliment to a very good meal. Now, there were a few items that i was not impressed with. The vegetables on the buffet were luke warm at best. The white rice was a tad bit dry and undercooked. The sushi was excellent, but prepared on-the-fly and not of the quality i would have expected from a sushi bar. The service was particularly sluggish, which surprised me considering the restaurant appeared to be fully staffed. The soda machine was not working properly, but the server did offer substitute selections. The price certainly reflects the quality and quantity of what you are paying for. Overall, this buffet is right on par with typical selections and expectations you'd expect to find. I would deem it worthy of a second trip in my book."}
{"text":"Kumo has ruined all other Asian restaurants for me.  Again had a high quality delicious meal."}
{"text":"Great variety of sushi..  Service is good! For 14 bucks unlimited sushi and food! A good deal I must say!"}
{"text":"Another delicious meal at Kumo's.....but I knew we would not be disappointed!! We enjoy going on Sunday (but also go on weekdays as well), because of the Dim Sum, and other Chinese delicacies served on Sunday....we have been there on Saturdays when dim sum is served as well, but some of the entrees are strictly a Sunday item. Today I saw a dish I had never noticed before....sweet and sour Pollock which was absolutely delicious!!!! The very attentive owner saw me checking it out at the buffet table, and told me it was a new item.  I had always thought the ginger \"white\" fish was my favorite fish, but the pollock is equally as good.  We are (recently) mostly vegetarian and never have a problem finding plenty of varieties of meatless items to satisfy our appetite..  Today I took 1 piece of mango chicken, and do every so often, just because it is so good....tender chicken with a light breading, in a tasty sauce....the high quality, tasty  food is not the only reason we continue to eat here (even though it is a bit of a drive).  The employees, are top notch!!  They are very friendly, always smiling, and quick to take your empty plates away....the buffet entrees are quickly replaced as they get low, and it seems that several employees are assigned strictly to the buffet area, for the purpose of keeping the areas clean."}
{"text":"The first thing i noticed as i walked in ,was the fact that the floors needed swept. I saw the buffet and the variety that was offered, i was impressed with that. The large buffets were set up with a very eye catching and appealing sprawl. The staff were typical, nothing over the top. Every hot dish i had was poor at best,either very bland or  to  over cooked. The sushi that was offered was not done well at all. Most of the sushi was room temperature , far to warm, which made me put off on trying anything they offered containing raw fish. Giant Eagle has better Sushi. I will never return here."}
{"text":"Too expensive... more than $34 for two people.

They cheap out on their sushi. If you love imitation crab swimming in bread crumbs and mayonnaise, this might be your gig.  They don't prepare their rice quite right.. It's always hard.  Also, if you want miniscule slices of sashimi, there's only a 20% chance you'll get any.

I don't know, I always regret it when I go."}
{"text":"Day 434: Kumo Japanese Seafood Buffet: Went here for the traditional Christmas Eve meal of Asian Buffet food with Aunt Liz and her husband Dave.

For a restaurant smack dab in the middle of Northeastern Ohio, I have no complaints about the breadth of its menu or use of traditional ingredients: if you want to try Fried Jellyfish, Crispy Intestine, or Knife Fish, while still having a fall back plan of, y'know, Mango Chicken and Rice, this would be the place. Sushi is high-quality too. 

Not gonna lie. The Pig Hoof I ate didn't sit quite well in my stomach afterwards. But trying it may have been hubris on my part to begin with."}
{"text":"Rather upset after this past visit. There is not a buffet in the area of that I have not warmed my mitts at and this place is no exception. I visited it when it first opened and it had momentum I tell you. It was packed and the food was delicious. I visited a few more times and then I took a large break as I was out of the area for several years. I returned and I was personally hurt. I arrived with a friend around 9 when they closed at 1030 according to their door. I was saddened that they had given up on the sushi and it was practically empty and they were packing to go at 9. I did not get sushi and I was bummed as I should be. The rest of the food was okay and the habachi was nothing great. I would say drive to Yellowtail, they had better sushi, habachi, and offerings. The price is about the same, just about 45 minute drive from Kumo. Not happy and this place has the least fricken on a floor that I have never seen, you are slipping like slip and slide."}
{"text":"I should have known this place has slipped in quality when I was the only customer after 5 pm.  Many of the hot dishes were cold.  They no longer have the habachi open and the sushi was all imitation crab meat.  The place was clean and the staff friendly, but I'll not be back."}
{"text":"Overwhelmed...there was a huge amount of selections. 

More traditional foods than Americanized. So beware if you are looking for the standard items...there are few here. 

The sushi for buffet sushi was very good and a wide area of rolls, sashimi, and nigiri. My husband tried every single selection and found himself going back for the tempura roll and the nigiri. 

The fish selections were awesome and the number of octopus dishes was more than I have ever seen. We avoided the oysters due to one of the tips. We tried the intestines which was and adventure for us but one we are glad we checked out. I didn't tell my husband or son what it was when I gave it to them. :)

There are several stations such as peeking duck, crepes, hibachi, and pho. The duck was great. I was too full to try the pho but will next visit."}
{"text":"When they first open we were very impressed that I even go here on my lunch hour from time to time.

However as time passes by they started going cheap on everything.

Their servers are friendly but boy do we have to keep bugging them for water/pop.  They seem to be in a dazed and doesn't follow through with their tables.  Be forewarn that if you are a heavy water drinker like myself --- order an extra glass of water otherwise your throat is going to end up dry.

The food is okay but PLEEEEEAASSEE change the damned menu!!! ... They have the same exact lunch/dinner food with an exception of one to two items that maybe the most they will change once in a full blue moon.

The price is not worth paying for something so mediocre unless you have money to throw around and doesn't care for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"been here many times around the holidays.  the food is decent for being in a very white suburbia.  there are authentic items on the buffet that range from chinese to japanese.  they also serve asian desserts next to the soups.  there's the usual pastry & ice cream station."}
{"text":"Although the all-you-can eat Asian buffet has become something of a cliche, this one has some fairly unique and special qualities that I think help it stand out from the crowed. In fact, at Snow Road just west of Broadview in Parma there are two such buffets, more or less across the street from each other and I eat at both. The difference is cost, atmosphere and selection and this one, Kumo, has better atmosphere and selection, and costs a little more. We went in on a Saturday evening around 7 pm. We were seated immediately and our beverages came quickly. The buffet was bustling and staff were constantly replenishing. There were many staff members on hand and the service and operation were pretty efficient.

Unlike other such buffets this one focuses very specifically on Asian fare and so does not have \"western\" selections like fried chicken or roast beef on the buffet. They do have some harder-to-find items that are worth trying if you have and adventurous palate. Today I was able to try some things I have never had, notably Salmon Heads and Sweet and Sour Jellyfish. One thing that you will notice at Kumo that sets it apart from the establishment across the street, and this is something I look for in Asian restaurants, is the number of Asian people eating there. And in the large dining room this evening, more than half and probably close to 2/3 of the patrons were Asian. This is always a good sign to me.

In addition to the hot dishes there is a broad array of sushi selections, a hibachi station, a crepe station, fresh fruits including Asian fruits such as dragon fruit and lichee, soups, a number of desserts and scoopable ice cream in 8 flavors. As long as everyone likes Asian food, there is something for everyone here.

The place was clean, the food was turning over quickly and being replaced quickly, the service was efficient but not over-solicitous and the food was delicious. We had three adults and one child with three soft drinks and paid about $80 before tip for a dinner that left us quite full."}
{"text":"I am so full. Any other place I would have 2 plates of everyday American, but the authentic variety of expertly crafted dishes. I couldn't eat all the different things. I loved the pig foot, and they even had tripe. The service was great and very attentive. Also very clean facilities. This is my first review that's how good it is."}
{"text":"With being to Kumo a couple years ago, my boyfriend and I decided to give this place another visit.  Let's just say I wish I knew about Fuji across the street.  

There was a major quality difference from a couple of years ago with both the food and the service.

We were seated and went to get our food.  The sushi selection was not as good as I remembered it last time.  One of the hand rolls I tried had to be one of the saltiest things I have ever eaten.    The hot dishes weren't that great, either.  I like fish, but a lot of the fish dishes had this strange \"ginger sauce\" on them and I didn't feel brave enough to try it.  I enjoyed the crab legs and the crayfish, but that doesn't say much.  

The desserts were ok, they had this crepe station that was alright, I wish they would use real whipped cream instead of this mysterious substance from a bag.  

I try and not say anything about the service at buffets, but damn.  It was very hard to get drink refills and our plates stayed with us for a while.  I saw a few of them just sitting in the corner talking to one another.

I will be taking my business to Fuji across the street.  They are over $5 cheaper and have a far better quality of food and service for the cheaper price."}
{"text":"Spend the weekend in Cleveland for Auto-Rama and saw a lot of great car filled up at the IX center. After a full day of walking, decided to stop by Kumo for dinner buffet.

As this restaurant named, there are quite a selection for seafood, sushi, chinese, dessert... All the food is hot and always being fill when it's about half empty. There are a few make to order station, such as crepe, hibachi and my favorite station, the pho or udon noodles soup station. Just pile your plate with your choice of ingredients and hand the plate to the chef, and he will do the magic. The only downside with this noodles soup station is they don't have a designated person who is in charge. When I am there, I waited for like 5 minutes before someone come and make my noodles soup.

Overall, I think the food selection and the server is good. I would love to come back to enjoy another fulfilling dinner at Kumo."}
{"text":"Delicous food, excellent selection! The food that came out of the hibachi grill was a little undercooked, but everything else was great. There was even a little crepe station where you pick the toppings and they cook it for you. 
The owner was the nicest guy too.
The location was just a little confusing but it is located behind the dollar bank on pearl road."}
{"text":"A great value at $7.99 for lunch!  It has an amazing selection of sushi!   Desserts!  My fav is coconut Tapioca Soup!  The deserts are to die for,  fresh pineapple with coconut gelatine is my fav along with freshly made crepes, freshly made soups and stir fries.  Made to your specifications!    A mix of Japanese, Chinese and slightly Americansa!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I used to go to Watami by the old Parma heights mall but it was closed. After hearing about Kumo from a family member, we decided to give it a try. We went around 230 on a Sunday. Walking into the place your immediate visual is tile floor, a huge hostess counter, and three white stone buffets; it's breath taking compared to other Japanese restaurants. Our waitress was very sweet, and attentive. She came multiple times to take our dirty plates. The buffet had a wide selection of sushi, chicken, rice, fish, deserts, soup, etc. But of course we came for the sushi, which in my opinion was outstanding. They continuously replenished and had a great variety. We'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I have just went here to celebrate someone's birthday. The food here is not too bad. They have chefs cook crapes, udon noodle soup, and beef or vegetable stir fry."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. Went at 8PM on a Thursday with two others and it was not good. The items all look very old and tasted that way also. We went here a couple years ago and loved it but they have really let it fall apart. To top the night the ceiling was leaking on me while I was eating. Then the check comes and it $55 for three people? And we had water? Never again."}
{"text":"Would be better if you could ever get hot food. Everything is always cold. Even if it just came from the kitchen."}
{"text":"No joke. Stay away! The food was terrible. The sushi is not good quality. The rolls are all rice, no fish, mostly imitation crab. The sashimi was so thin like paper you would have had to eat eight to get one real piece. I tried the hot bar and spit out the food because there was gristle. The meat was so chewy I could not chew it. It makes me feel like Americans will eat any processed crap put in front of them. I did not eat. I asked the manager to bring my bill for my one beer and sake but that I could not eat the food and was going to go elsewhere for dinner. He refused. He refused to let me talk to the owner. He refused my business card. He was screaming and yelling at me in the restaurant. I told him I would not tolerate the abuse and was calling the police to objectively settle it since I would not leave without paying and he refused to take my payment for the alcohol without charging me $14.99 for the buffet I did not eat. I had no choice since I did not want to be arrested for dining and dashing. I tried to call but could not get a signal in the restaurant. I asked him if I could call from his desk phone. He refused me. I said I was going to step outside of the front door to get a signal and call. He manhandled me. blocked me, grabbed me and held the doors shut. I told him to get his hands off of me then went out and called the police. Two squad cars and three wonderful officers later, we got resolution. I paid for the alcohol and left. The dispatcher was concerned for me because she could hear him yelling the entire time at me while I spoke to her. The officer asked him for his social security number. He said he gave it with his name to the dispatcher. He did not. He simply called to say he was the manager of Kumo and a customer was leaving without paying. He asked them to send a car while I was talking to the dispatcher. This place is shady and terrible. Save your money and go get real sushi. I cannot believe someone would treat me so terrible because the quality was substandard. He offered to let me pay a discounted rate then brought me the bill for the full price and said I insulted him by calling his food crap and that 300 people come and eat there per day. Everyone's taste is different. I could not eat this food. It escalated and he refused to compromise then verbally abused me and physically touched me. That is NOT acceptable. I had given him my business card. As if a professional was going to drive away! I'm not stupid. I wanted an objective arbitrator."}
{"text":"I know someone who caught them dumpster diving in the Marcs dumpster,taking old produce.I haven't been back since."}
{"text":"After seeing how well Kumo was rated, the boy and I thought we would try it out.

Giant mistake.

Pros:
The service was great.
Everything seemed clean.
There was a large amount of options to choose from.

Cons:
The food.
The sushi.
That one piece that I put in my mouth and then had to restrain myself from vomiting.

We expected decent sushi and Asian food... something similar to Watami.  Upon entering the space was well lit, busy, and nicely designed.  We definitely thought we were in for a good experience.

The rolls were fairly bland.  Many of them had so little besides the rice that you could not determine what you were eating.  I'm adventurous and tried a fairly diverse amount of rolls... there was one that was so foul (I think the fish was left out) that it literally turned my stomach.

The rest of the buffet was below mediocre.  Lots of greasy items, low in flavor, drenched in salty baths of sauce.

Now... perhaps kumo just isn't for us.  The place was PACKED.  People piled their plates high (and we followed some of their choices... thinking that they \"knew\" what to get... we were wrong).

The best thing about the meal?  The store bought fortune cookies.

Our bill was $40 for 2 buffet dinners, a beer and a soda.  No thanks Kumo... we were truly disappointed."}
{"text":"passable food. sushi was better than i expected, but only to a degree. the rest of the food was meh. 
general crowd there was pretty unkempt"}
{"text":"I was really surprised by Kumo after hearing about it from friends. I'm a buffet fan, but this place has a LOT more to offer; sushi, hot foods, salad bar and a variety that I've not seen in a buffet in quite a while. 

They're prices might seem a tad higher that average, but that's because they serve more than average. If you're looking for a place to get a good meal and then some, try Kumo (BTW, in Japanese, one translation of Kumo is \"cloud\", but trust me, you'll be lighter going in than coming out:)"}
{"text":"A bunch of friends and I went here for my birthday and it was so much fun! Like a lot of restaurants, they sing when they find out its your birthday. We were serenaded in 3 different languages. It was pretty hilarious. One of the waiters had a gong and was right behind me. 

The food itself consisted of some pretty generic Asian buffet style foods and some really amazing seafood! It even had some fresh raw oysters. I was a little hesistant to try them at first, but they were really good! The sushi offering was not as full as I would have liked. There were more vegetarian options and only salmon and some tuna. There are definitely better sushi places around if you're interested in sushi, but for its price (14.99 per person), this place is not bad at all."}
{"text":"This place his really gone downhill over the past couple years. Today it got me to the point of swearing off all Japanese/Chinese buffets forever. I get it, you come to these type of establishments knowing what to expect, a huge variety with average quality. I get it, it's mass produced food but we were here at 6p on a Saturday (primetime) and it was bad. Most of the hot food was barely warm or cold and I didn't even bother with the sushi. The calamari, clams, and kalbi were so tough I couldn't even chew them down to swallow. The crawfish and pepper prawns were barely warm and lacking any flavor. The Singapore chicken was ok but still barely warm. I basically paid $46 (my wife and I) for pot stickers, lo mein, fried rice, and subpar hot entrees and 2 soft drinks. I could've gotten better food from my local carryout for a hell of a lot less money. The service was ok but I'm never going back. I was thoroughly disappointed tonight."}
{"text":"Kumo, thank you for being in Parma.

While I don't think Kumo lives up to the service or sushi level as Yellow Tail in Fairlawn, it is pretty darn good!

There is a nice selection of \"traditional\" Chinese fare as well as sushi rolls for ever.
Will I go again?  YES!"}
{"text":"The sushi was good and had a vast selection. Nothing fancy, but all the usual stuff. Ice cream was good as well. I had the miso soup and my kids had wonton and we all enjoyed the soup. The shrimp chips were stale which was disappointing to both my kids. While many were there eating the crawfish, crab legs, and other sea food, that wasn't my preference. My son had some, but said the mussels were cold. That's my big complaint is that I had a lot of like warm food and some that must have been on for days because it was very chewy or hard. I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Visited family for the 4th of July. Group of us had holiday lunch at kumo. Not a fan of buffet, but the food seemed fresh, wide variety, not overly salty. Plenty of seafood choices, fresh fish, crab claws, crab legs, shrimp, plus a few alternative dishes, like noodles, soup, sweet and sour, etc. Chef can make hibachi dish, dessert crepes. Usual array of sushi.

OK place for lunch, maybe dinner. Have normal expectations, get what you pay for, and you will enjoy the meal."}
{"text":"Worst sushi I've ever had! The rolls are never fresh, they have obviously been sitting in the refrigerator for about 2 days. And their deep fried rolls are even cold!!! If I'm eating a deep fried roll I'm hoping it will at least be somewhat warm. The fish is bad quality as well, always discolored and a bad texture. Being from California, this place is an absolute disgrace to the sushi world and should be ashamed of themselves for calling what they have \"sushi\". Go across the street to fuji, its a better price and it's much better quality for the quality sushi you get there."}
{"text":"This place has become disgusting over the past couple years. The food tonight was the worst I've had there and I will not be returning. They didn't stock crab legs or seafood items once, and half the things I had were either cold or had been sitting in the warmers so long they were inedible. When mentioned to management on way out he seemed to not care. Sad because we live so close, but can't stomach it again. Also costs $71 for 2 kids and 2 adults. Go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Knowing that buffet style sushi is sub-par with sushi from non-buffet places is critical.  This place is very good looking inside and out, clean, friendly staff, and has a good variety of food.  Sure most of the sushi is either artificial crab or shrimp, and mostly rice, but for buffet style they keep it fun.  I think only one of the 8 different kinds i got was questionable, which, again for buffet style is pretty darn good.  The Chinese portion was decent and they also have sweets for dessert, but we didn't have any.  They are kid friendly so if you're looking for a more upscale, private ambiance, why the heck are you going to a buffet?  They are cheap and if you're looking to smash that craving for sushi, this place fits the bill."}
{"text":"Overpriced for the quality. Almost every sushi offered is made with imitation crab. They only offer two or three things not made with the imitation crab meat. Cold tiny crab legs and peel and eat shrimp are the highlight of this place. Ehhh.

The restaurant is extremely clean and organized. The waitresses are rude. That's all for now. Lol"}
{"text":"I know this place is not high art, but the food's pretty good and the price is right.  I probably stop her a couple times a month and grab a carry out box.  The variety of sushi is pretty good, but I normally go for the more simple things anyway.  I've said in a other sushi reviews, I understand the workmanship of a deep fried, glazed, crab sparkle roll with honey almond aioli, but I like sashimi and avocado rolls.  Anyway, the hot foods are ok too.  For a quick, inexpensive grab and go, I'll keep coming here. For date night sushi there are more appropriate places scattered about town."}
{"text":"Couldn't think of a better review to write for my 100th review. 

I'm writing another rave review for this wonderful buffet. It has only gotten better since my last time here. The service is extremely friendly, prompt, and knowledgeable. The restaurant looks as if it has gotten a bit of a sprucing up with uniforms and nice black \"leather\" dining seats. The buffet tables are hot, fresh, abundant and spotlessly clean. 

The sushi section is fresh and has a wide variety of sushi and fresh sashimi that is always being replenished. 

The soup and hot bar contains just about every asian style soup and plenty of asian staples. They also have a crepe station and a wok station for fresh stir-fry dishes. The dessert section is wide, contains fresh fruit, ice cream (that green tea one, though!) and an assortment of pastries. My favorite is the coconut jelly. 

On Sundays they have dim sum which was truly an experience. I tried tripe and loved it. You know you have someone who knows how to cook when you try taboo, lesser eaten animal parts and actually fall in love with the taste and texture. That's what I love about Kumo...always something new, authentic, and interesting while being absolutely delicious. 

What a humble meal..."}
{"text":"Kumo Japanese Seafood Buffet: huge selection for a great price!

Kumo is my favorite place for lunch. There are so many delicious items to choose from. Some of my favorites are: clams in black bean sauce, cheese mussels, salmon, honey chicken, mango chicken, pepper steak, chicken with broccoli, salted chicken, seafood vermicelli, crab Rangoon and spicy mussels, just to name a few!  

Other entree choices include fried chicken, tempura vegetables, squid, teriyaki chicken, potato wedges, Lo mein and fried rice. 

There is a great selection of soups, although the only ones I can recall are miso soup and fish ball soup. 

Kumo has an excellent variety of sushi. I don't know much about sushi, but this sure is a great place to try them all and pick a favorite or two. 

And the dessert options are pretty good too: fresh fruit (pineapple, oranges, bananas, lychee, peaches) , cakes, cookies and ice cream. 

They've recently started serving beer + wine, foreign and domestic. 

The service is friendly and attentive. I rarely have had a dirty plate left alone for more than 30 seconds. 

There is plenty of parking as Kumo is located in a strip mall."}
{"text":"Growing up in LA, I've had my fair share of Asian buffets. I have to say that Kumo is one of the better buffets I've tried within its price range! I came here on a Monday night, and the dinner price was only $14.99 per person! So cheap! :) 

There is a huge selection of sushi, seafood, Chinese food, and desserts. They also had a separate station for udon, Mongolian stir fry, and crepes! My favorite items included the sushi hand rolls, fried squid, clams, and green tea ice cream. I also tried their crabs and oysters, which were a bit tasteless in my opinion.

Overall, I enjoyed my dining experience here and will most likely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Kumo has a fantastic buffet. Many people think that Kumo only has sushi, but it offers a lot more. They have different types of chicken, fish, noodles, rice, etc.
The food is very tasty, and the atmosphere is clean and comforting. They offer lots of food and I promise that it won't disappoint!
It is great for families with children too!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go to when i am hungry.  The only disadvantage is the calories that i get, but its all worth it especially on dinner time with the tasty crab they offer..."}
{"text":"This place is usually good and it would've gotten a four star rating. Unfortunately, I had bad sushi that tasted horrible and made me feel sick. I told them I wouldn't like to pay as I am a weekly client. At first they said  okay, then I tried to leave and they forced me to pay. Everything else wasn't too good either. I'm never going back again."}
{"text":"Came here on the eve of Thanksgiving (for dinner) wasn't sure if they would be opened, they were and I am so thankful! This place has the most variety of foods I have ever seen for a Japanese buffet! From sushi, seafood, noddles, dessert were all amazing! 
I was amazed by the sushi, I would come again just to eat the sushi.  They must have had over 30 types/flavors of sushi including sashimi!!! It was very fresh and you could see the people making it behind the counter. 
I was also very impressed by the Udon noodle station. (I filled up on sushi, so didn't have room to try). But you were able to select all the goodies you wanted in your soup (veggies, meat, seasoning, etc) and then the people put the fresh noddles   And broth inside for you. 
They also had 3 rows of just seafood, from mussels, crab, crayfish, clams....I was soon in a happy food coma! They also have the typical Chinese food selections too, so if someone in your party isn't a seafood fan, they'll find something they like here! 
Dessert also has an impressive layout, if you have room! Mainly American dessert options, but tasty! 
Dinner was $15, for all you can eat, which I find to be an amazing deal! I hear their lunch is cheaper but less selections.   
Take the whole family, everyone will find something to satisfy their food coma! Happy eating!!"}
{"text":"great sushi! loved the coconut shrimp. the snow crab legs were okay, not that great the day I went... but great friendly staff & nice family place."}
{"text":"Never ate sushi until coming to kumos. Let me tell you, it's the BEST food I have ever tasted. My bf and I come here almost every other week because we are addicted to the sushi."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent. I've been going here once a week for the last year.  Never had a bad experience.  Something else worth mentioning is they are very accommodating for customers who are wheel chair bound.  A very nice place to eat."}
{"text":"I have honestly past my phase of loving a Chinese buffet; well I thought I had!  Look 75% of the Chinese buffets you visits are simply a clone of the last; none of which as good as days gone by including this one on that front.  

Taking the good old days with 2' high piles of crab legs out of the equation lets take a look at Kumo standing on it's own and as it relates to other options of the same concept.

1. Standing on it's own. The food selection was vast and very tasty. The carb is served as knuckles and packed with breading. While this is not what I would look for in crab it was tasty but difficult to maneuver around shell as the knuckle is packed with slivers of shell. As for the other items it was all really very good (At a Chinese fast food level).

2. Compared to most other Chinese buffets I would say the food was measurably better quality and certainly overall tasted much better than your average.  Regarding selection these guys beat all of the others in N.E. Ohio hands down by a mile!

3. Sushi. The sushi assortment again beat the other buffets hands down by at least a multiple of 

4; I would say no less than 25 kinds of rolls. As with all the other buffets however I would of course seek out sushi from a respected sushi house such as Otani (Mayfield Hts OH). They like all other buffets use fake crab and other lower end ingredients. With that in mind they are making it fresh in front of you continuously and for what it is pretty tasty :).  To many it is probably outstanding however I am a bit of a sushi snob; as such I have enjoyed sushi made properly and with real ingredients from all corners of our great country.

5. Desert. I am not a sweets person so I had one bite of a small cupcake. Tasted good but way to sweet for me WAY to sweet.. But as I said I don't really care for sugary treats. The fruit however unlike most other buffets was really really good. Actually ripe, sweet and just great!

6. Salad: The salad toppings was fairly limited but just fine for my liking. The ingredients were fresh, crisp and ripe. The dressing.... Well I am picking on my dressing but the dressing was pretty good.

7. Hibachi station: Shockingly I did not try the Hibachi. The selection of ingredients looked fresh and there was a line so I am going to assume based upon this and the food I did enjoy that it is a hit. This will be my first stop on my next visit.

In closing. Atmosphere was what you would expect from a buffet however it was very clean and large with room or section dividers. Gave each area a bit of privacy and kept the dining experience quiet; they did a really good job here.  The staff was just great. Very polite, smiling and helpful.

This is a place that I will visit over and over. Whenever in the mood to just pig out (not often) and want some tasty food to fill that crazing Kumo is a decent go to!

I am uploading several pictures as well and I hope this review is informative."}
{"text":"One of the best buffets I have been to in a long time.. I can't say how the dinner is as I visited during the lunch time hours.. But OMG talk about a lot to choose from especially sushi! And just under 10 bucks for myself that's worth it alone..."}
{"text":"I love sushi! I even have a tattoo to prove it. This place was awesome.  Fresh fish, hot food, and friendly staff that kept my iced tea full. Too full to think of the next time I'll eat, but I know I'll be going back soon."}
{"text":"Horrible. Let me start out by saying I think buffets can be pretty good under the right circumstances and obviously you don't anticipate gourmet food.  This place was awful.  The food was all mildly warm not hot even though you could see steam coming from the buffet.  I ordered a hot tea & the waitress brought me a mug of just hot water & then was annoyed when I asked for tea not just hot water.  It was $20 which was way over priced for the quality of cold crap they served.  Lastly, I seen an employee grab the tongs from the fried onions and use them to hold the dirty dish rag to wipe between the food trays and then when he was done put them back in the fried onions for use.  After using them with the dirty dish rag!   Gross!   I would not recommend this place except to the health department.   

I typically only review places I think are very good and deserve compliments. But occasionally when a restaurant is particularly awful I feel I need to warn people not to waste your money."}
{"text":"my brother and i went here last week...ive been wanting to try it for awhile now....i never write reviews...i usually just read them....but i felt compelled to write one after going here......

the sushi is not good....hard rice ... fish was not fresh.....taste was off putting

their hibachi area is gross...some of the meat was brownish and turned me off completely....iam suprised it has not be fined....how long can this meat stay out in open air....it looked bad///

the soups were thin and bad....

I pretty much had full plates of food that i pushed to the side....wasted money going here...

very surprised it got 4 stars......will never go back..

service was good"}
{"text":"I went towards the end of the lunch price.  After I was seated and drinks were bright to the table, I was offered a choice between lunch or dinner pricing. If I chose lunch it meant not eating the seafood options. She had to elaborate because I was confused, they're a seafood place.  If I didn't eat the craw dads, crab legs,  shrimp and one or two other items I could choose the lunch.  I opted for dinner. I misread the sign on the way in and thought dinner would be 12.99, but it was 15.99 on Fri. Sat. And Sun.  Perhaps they offer different food items on these days or maybe the 12.99 is a brief special? 
I was disappointed when the crab legs were served cold. This makes them difficult to crack the shell.  Drinks were filled promptly and plates were removed moments after I was finished with them.
They offer a crepe station.
Food is changed out  and replenished, items are hot."}
{"text":"I was expecting too much of this place, I think, and ended up kind of disappointed. I came here on Sunday at 6pm for dinner with a group of 10 other people. Right away I went for the seafood since that was the only reason why I wanted to go. The clams and spicy shrimp were really good but I was sorely disappointed by the ginger crab and crawfish. The crab was limp and had no ginger flavor at all or salt for that matter. The crawfish tasted completely bland like it had been sitting out for awhile. I then tried the sushi which was meh, not really exciting at all. The crab legs took forever to be filled and were only placed literally 5 or 6 legs at a time. The oysters also took forever to be filled and only 10 were placed out the entire 2 hours we were there. I didn't try the other Chinese buffet items since I can get those anywhere. The green tea ice cream thank goodness was still in a full tub so I was able to get a nice sized scoop and I really liked the crepe station where you could choose from many fruit flavors and chocolate. Overall my experience was ok. Our waiter kind of hovered next to our table waiting to pick up the plates. It was both awkward and convenient at the same time since our plates were quickly cleared each time we were finished. It was a good price for what you got but the quality could be better."}
{"text":"This place is a favorite gathering place of my extended family to meet at, so I've been here many times. Though I've been to quite a few Asian buffets, they're not really on my priority list of places to dine. However, I must admit that Kumo is probably one of the best buffets I've been to. They have an expansive selection of food, especially on the weekends. They have a dedicated sushi bar, which I was expecting to be grocery store bought quality... but, no - they were actually pretty decent. They have crab legs for dinner, and dim sum on the weekends... also pretty decent. An eclectic salad bar that includes my favorites of seaweed and kimchi. A crepe station and udon noodle station. They also have Mongolian BBQ station!! The rest of the food is pretty standard. As probably true with most buffets, if you want to ensure the freshest food, try going there right when they open - right before noon. 

Because of my family's affection for this place, I know I'll be back many more times... which I don't mind, at all!"}
{"text":"Great food great customer service I love going there with my family there's a lot of selections for picky eater like my kids. STRONGLY recommend!"}
{"text":"My review will be short and sweet , to the point. My credentials are I've ate everywhere Asian , and my wife is real Chinese , not born here so she knows Chinese food. So I get deep into the dark recesses of China town.  I hit this place up on a regular basis, for a long time and So do all Asians. They know where too eat and  not to eat. its usually more than  %50  Asians.   I don't know anywhere that has a Asian American buffet as good as this one. The selection is huge.  The lunch price is the exceptional deal. The dinner price is  a bit more then across the street. And justified on the fact that this is the best Asian buffet around. The Food is  very specifically on Asian fare , and seafood, and so does not have \"western\" selections like fried chicken or the giant  roast beef on the buffet. They do have Chicken wings though. There is a broad array of sushi selections, a hibachi station, a crepe station, fresh fruits including Asian fruits such as dragon fruit and lichee, soups, a number of desserts and scoopable ice cream As long as everyone likes Asian food, there is something for everyone here. As with all buffets , that serve Americans , theres not a lot of  stand alone vegetables like real Chinese restaurants. But their green beans are exceptional .  The food is always steaming, the cold food is always cold. I never had any issues. There is a place across the street that is similar and a bit cheaper. A comparison would be like A+ verses B+ comparison. No problem either way. I just don't see the point of going across the street anymore. Unless you like to try new things a lot.   But lunch at $7.99 is a super duper deal. I think Dinner is $16.99 . And I don't really care what it is."}
{"text":"As far as buffets go, this is one is a lot better than Yellow Tail in Akron. They have a large sushi variety and all the fried seafood combinations you can imagine. Most of the sushi is quite edible. The stir-fry station was actually very good. Most of the sushi tasted relatively fresh and good as far as buffet sushi goes. Once again, I've never had buffet sushi that beat real restaurant sushi.

However, be wary of the Nigiri and Sashimi advertised on their website. They use very little fish for the Nigiri, like a sliver of tuna with a ton of rice, not to mention the lack of freshness. On top of that the salmon Nigiri looks diabolically and artificially bright red. The Sashimi was actually pretty good, but they only put out one batch the entire hour or so I was there and it was gone within 5 seconds. Beware of the obese, experienced buffet aficionados who will swoop in next to you and take the entire tray of Sashimi while you are standing in front of the sushi attendant who just put it down. 

Another issue is that the restaurant seems to have a constant plumbing problem. The first time I was there a year ago, my friend witnessed massive diarrhea all over the toilet seat when he was about to use the restroom. I was thinking about using the restroom before I left, but I overheard the waiters laughing about how the toilet got clogged again (I understand Chinese) so I passed."}
{"text":"Delicious!! Kumo is not like other Americanized Asian Food Buffets, they actually have things that Asians like me can enjoy!! Coming from San Francisco I frequently yearn for authentic Chinese and Japanese food and can rarely find it here in NE Ohio, unless I go to the Asian Plaza in Cleveland. Kumo offers a HUGE variety of dishes from sushi, to dim sum, soups, noodles, and meats! The food is always fresh and their always packed with customers. If you are in the area and looking for a good buffet with authentic food at a decent price, give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Yes, I have been dying to visit the Mecca, the Jerusalem of my dream buffet.  I always wanted to visit a great place where I could be eating like king Solomon and have seven virgins surrounding me and serving me (sounds familiar?). But my life was plagued with so many devils that have been directing me into many directions but here. Many times I was led to glittering temples of gold by many prophets who called themselves \"food critics\",  but I found no real nirvana inside there.  Alas, I think I have lived a very much a life of dedicated pilgrimage last year,,,, I have absolved from eating luxury food, all kinds of temptations, even had abstained myself from pleaseures de amor., and finally this last January, I was directed to this Mecca by some mysterious glittering object (glowing in the dark) and the voice told me to take Snow rd to this place (later I recalled this voice might have been really God Almighty directing me). I did not know where I was at first, but just as I sat down, and opened my eyes, there was an utmost beautiful scenery that consisted of all kinds of gourmet food that was once promised to me by heavenly voices while I was going through all those pilgrimage while I lived on earthly place.  
I opened my eyes, realizing that I was day dreaming my pilgrimage for a great Japanese-Chinese buffet. But, in fact, this place is indeed the best ever buffet in this genre that i have ever visited. I can say that this place serves real quality food (not salty like some other buffets).    
I am so proud of the fact that a place like this even exists in Cleveland, no, no, to tell you the truth, I am so grateful that I finally found a mecca of my appetite after a lifelong journey of agonizing search for mecca,,,,,, I thought I will die before I get there. I am just thankful I am one of the few chosen by God Almighty to finally taste the heaven. O alas,, I will be a devote believer of Thy Almighty,,,,please be merciful to me and keep this blessed place open for a very very long time,.... till I no longer exist,,,,and,,,,,, I no longer want to be like God after I die,.... I want to reincarnate into a human so I can come visit this mecca of Japanese Seafood Buffet again and again,,, !!!!!  Forgive me my Almighty God, I am just a human."}
{"text":"Our family has been going here since they were Hong Kong Buffett although now we prefer Fuji Grill across the street.  Yesterday I took my 89 year old mother to Kumo for lunch because she could order off the menu instead of having to go to the buffet.  The waitress was extremely patient with her as she griped about everything.  Extremely fast service on her made to order meal for $5.50.

The lunch buffet sushi selection was poor compared to Fuji.  I tried most of the items that Fuji doesn't serve (spicy octopus, fish balls, Singapore chicken).  They have the weekday lunch buffet on sale for $7.99 so they may be cutting back on the quality."}
{"text":"I love this place, but it is way over priced. The sushi is decent for a buffet, most of it is some form of imitation crab meat. They don't put smoked salmon in the philly rolls, and all of the fish is pre frozen. That is what I would expect if I was paying $10 per person, but this place is more like $20 per person. The do have a lot of seafood: clams, mussels, squid, crab legs, shrimp, ext...They also have a hibachi station. There is certainly plenty to choose from. No issues other than the price here."}
{"text":"I should have known better. I have never been to a good sushi buffet and this was no better.  The place seems clean and all the food is set up neatly on the buffet. But I had two plates of different foods and i couldn't finish any of it. I was excited about green tea ice cream, but even that wasn't good. The sushi was pretty but the fish didn't taste fresh. The Philadelphia roll was pretty good. I just can't give it more than 1 star because I thought everything tasted like dishwater. Some of my dining companions enjoyed it more than I, stating that the mussels were really good."}
{"text":"I've passed Kumo so many times on my way to school that I decided it was time to finally give it a try. I was under the preconceived notion that it was a seafood-only buffet (The name is slightly misleading) which is not something that sounds extremely mouth watering to me. Luckily I was wrong. In fact, Kumo has a massive selection of Asian delights in their buffet. If you are a sushi fan, you won't be disappointed with the selection - pretty much anything you could imagine is available, including some less appetizing choices like the 'hot-dog roll.' 

I can honestly say that I thoroughly enjoyed the selection and while not everything was the best I've had at an Asian buffet, most was good on my palate. I'm not sure that calling it 'Japanese' is appropriate either, as very little of the cuisine originated in Japan. Asian-ish would be more correct but it was delicious none the less.

Now that I've tried Kumo, they can expect to see my face in the future. It is great food, a reasonable price, and pretty much the only Asian option in the area. That sounds like a recipe for success."}
{"text":"Honestly the worst Asian buffet I've ever had the misfortune of experiencing. I always enjoy a good mix of Asian-American crossover food. This place was not the aforementioned. The sushi was awful, dry, ick, not pleasant or appetizing, at all. I would rate the sushi I get at my local grocer leaps and bounds ahead of what Kumo offered. I even went and gave it another try after they brought out more of the California roll. Big mistake. My SO and I, who usually go back for multiple plates went back for one small serving. Even then, I regretted it. If I don't get food poisoning or get extremely sick, it'll be a miracle. The final price for 2 was outrageous for the meal offered. I'm really disappointed. It seemed like such a nice place with a good environment and clean serving areas. The food looked delicious. The end result was anything but. Do yourself a favor and stay away."}
{"text":"I have been here 2 times and the 2nd time is a week after the first time. My friends and I usually drive from Cleveland to Akron for a sushi buffet. This is our big discovery!!! We now don't need to drive to Akron to have a good buffet. 
The food quality here is good. The sushi is good and there are around 15-20 types of sushi to choose. The side dishes are also good too. They also have a lot of chinese food. It's even larger than the sushi bar. The dinner is $14.99. We end up with about $20 include tax, drink, and tip. 
If you are a fan of sushi and chinese food, this is a place that won't disappoint you."}
{"text":"My first visit was not all that exciting. not a big sushi fan yet . no peper steak."}
{"text":"One of the best Chinese buffet I've tried in the States. Got a large variety of hot n cold dishes, soups, sushi etc, even have crab legs and crawfish. 

Don't expect everything to be high quality genuine Chinese food though. After all, this is just a buffet place."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place. We always go in and enjoy the buffet but this time we opted for carry out. Sushi is charged by pound and they give you a big white to-go container to fill up. We also ordered general two chicken and extra egg rolls and only costed $20! I was shocked. Made me love this place even more."}
{"text":"Our older children were craving sushi buffet and we found this place on Yelp. The atmosphere was nice and quiet. I noticed there was no soft music playing in the background which made pregnant pauses in conversation a bit awkward. The buffet had a lot of choices from traditional cuisine to American made Chinese. The kiddos enjoyed the sushi buffet. I'm a fried rice snob and they only had the cheap fried rice on the buffet. Overall, for the price and the choices this is a good Chinese buffet. We will return."}
{"text":"We went to Kumo Japanese buffet for the first time for dinner last night.  I was with a large group (36 people) and there was another even larger private party going on (over 100 people), so the restaurant was PACKED!  We were lucky as the Kwan Lion Dance crew performed a Lunar New Year show, so we got a bit of an entertainment break between sittings of gorging on all variety of food.  The sushi was ok, but I think they can improve their rolling skills - it's an art form.  On the other hand, they were swamped with many hungry patrons last night, so that could have been the reason.  They had shucked raw oysters, lots of cooked crab legs, shrimp, mussels, clams, etc.  If sushi or seafood is not your thing, not to fear - Kumo has lots of other offerings so even the most conservative of diners can enjoy a meal here.  The buffet is extensive but I'll lump them into categories: sushi, cold seafood bar, hot seafoods, hot beef and chicken dishes, noodle/rice staion, hibachi bar, udon-noodle station, soup station, hot veggies, salad bar, fruit bar, dessert bar, ice-cream cooler, and made-to-order crepe station.  More than enough to fill even the largest of appetites.  When eating at a buffet, the attaction is typically the quantity and variety.  At Kumo, you certainly get this - and decent quality.  At very reasonable pricing.  I will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"I have been there multiple times. The sushi us ok and the buffet is limited. I was satisfied with my meal until I saw one of the employees walking around with a fly swatter and killing flies OVER PEOPLE EATING! Stay away"}
{"text":"Yuck stay away from this place i took my cousin here for lunch today and we got ready to make our plates at the buffet i noticed after i picked up my plate i noticed a smashed bug or some kind of critter on the other plate on top of the stack we left this place its not safe to eat at, it shouldn't be dead bugs on plates at the buffet that's unsanitary I showed the critter to a worker at the restaurant all she did was remove the plate from the stack that the dead bug was on lol that's just unacceptable no apology or nothing i wont ever return customers beware"}
{"text":"Stars: 3+

Pros:
This is a sushi buffet = sushi is not extraordinarily high quality, but is still quite good in my opinion. 

What I really enjoy is that in the back, they have a station where a cook will whip up noodles and such for you at your request. You have to pick out the noodles, meat, fish, veggies, sauce, etc. It is like Fire and Ice / Mongolian BBQ..

The pricing is EXCELLENT for lunches and the selection is pretty big. My friends always get the snow crab legs, which are decently sized. They seem to like it. 


Cons:
This is a step down from Minado (another sushi buffet), without a doubt, both in terms of quality and presentation."}
{"text":"For $15.99 dinner on Saturday, it's the best bargain! Numerous choices! You can find authentic Chinese rib soup here, sweat sour fish... I think this is the best Chinese buffet in town!"}
{"text":"I just had the absolute worst experience of my life, at a Chinese buffet.  

First we came two hours before it was scheduled to close.  The food was all old and crusty.  I go for crab Rangoon.  Teriyaki steak.  Coconut shrimp, etc... The dishes we like at these places.  Not one time were at least 5 dishes refreshed after being empty.   At one point we had so many dishes on our table we had to flag down a server.  We were bottom priority compared to closing procedures.  They has a server taking condiments off the table while we were eating (soy sauce, sugar packets, etc...)

Our drinks stayed empty the entire time.  The sushi was all old and tasted like eating salt.   All the food that was out was old.  They had only two chicken options, on the entire buffet.  I could go on and on at the lack of items on the buffet and very low quality of food.  At one point my friend wanted to get sherbet at the desert station.  It was 9:15 pm.  Again they close at 1030.  Instead of getting his sherbet they put it all away, almost an hour and a half before close.  

I was disgusted and stopped eating long before.  I was steaming and asked for a manager.  He was arguing with me about exactly how many plates of sub par food I got.  He kept going on about if I was at a American place it would be the same.  He kept saying I'll bring you fresh food over and over again.  He didn't understand the disgust of our experience.   He began to raise his voice and spit on me.  He was very unprofessional and I will NEVER go back to this place.  $30 for two people to be treated like we didn't exist.  I've been here before and liked it, but after our experience we will never go back.  Unprofessional.  Dirty.  Terrible waitress service. Hours old sushi.  No fresh food.  

Please take your business elsewhere.  They don't deserve the time, or your hard earned money. 

You're better off getting takeout from china jade down the street.  It's so much better."}
{"text":"I was freaken OVERWHELMED!!!!!!!
Seriously!!!!  I had to take a step back and just soak in ALL THE GLORIOUS DELICIOUSNESS that Kumo had to offer...
There...Was...EVERYTHING!!!!!!!!
No bother trying to tell ya's what this MAMMOTH buffet has to offer, just think what you want and yes, you will find it...I was there for over an hour and had a boatload of offerings and STILL did not get everything I wanted as again, the offerings are just GINORMOUS!!!!!!
You want a substantial buffet for a reasonable price?

KUMO!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The food here is great but don't believe that they open at 11:00. The sign may say it's open and they'll let you in to sit at the table, but if you get there when the doors open what you'll see is an empty buffet with half a dozen people yelling at each other while they try to fill it by 11:30. 

Seriously, if it's really not open until 11:30, please don't open the doors until then... (perhaps you should charge half price for the people who come between 11:00 and 11:30? They only get half a buffet!)"}
{"text":"Stopped sat night after shopping. Food was cold and subpar even for Chinese buffet standards. But the worst part was the staff. They all seemed bothered that we were even there. Granted it was 8pm and they probably closed at 9 however I have never been treated so poorly by a restaurant staff. It was almost comical.  I night to remember for sure"}
{"text":"Saturday lunch...place was relatively busy.  Interesting that there were many Asian people eating there, as that would indicate the food would be of quality.

That said, this wasn't significantly better or worse than any other Chinese buffet I've tried.  A couple of the dishes were good (Mango chicken, crab rangoon), but the hot & sour soup was lukewarm and gelatinous.  I decided to move on to something else when I had to remove chunks of gelatin from the bowl.

We shared a few pieces of sushi (only cooked stuff), and they were okay, but I didn't want to press my luck by having more than a few pieces.

One last complaint - while my daughter's meal was discounted ($5.99), the regular lunch price is $11.99...a little on the pricy side."}
{"text":"Great buffet! Nice inside, I'm completely obsessed with the pho  especially since you make or yourself!! I find every excuse possible to go here and eat oodles of noodles"}
{"text":"2.5 stars. Went here with a big group. 
 service was decent, spicy tuna rolls , seared tuna, shrimp, clams, soups, and Japanese salads.

Not so good
I was disappointed with the sushi selection, had to ask for sashimi,  cooked fish was old and snow crab was not present.  

15% gratuity added when plates were not cleared from the table is a lot lame.

Buffet is worth 10 to 11 dollars."}
{"text":"I struggled with the idea of rating a buffet 5 stars, I really did. But then I thought of the quality. The service. The variety. The prices. On a rating scale exclusively for buffets, it's a no-brainer. Officially, I would rate it a 4.5 if I could.

They have a decent selection of sushi. The rolls tend to be small, safe, and tame, which is expected for a buffet. They do a good job of keeping it fresh. On the hot side, they have mostly Chinese buffet fare, but it is noticeably better quality than your average generic-name \"Hunan China One Dragon Star Dynasty Palace\" buffet. From time to time they will surprise you with unique dishes as well. They have a cold section which includes but is not limited to: kim chi, seaweed salad, oysters in a half shell, cocktail shrimp, and baby octopus if you're daring enough. They have a Mongolian BBQ station, a crepe station, and (my fave) an udon station. Desserts are mostly standard fare with bulk pastries, fruits, puddings, and hard ice cream. Oh, and the party cake ice cream, which is probably the best ice cream that you've never had. Make sure you save room for it and prepare to have your mind blown.

For what it is, you'd be hard pressed to find something better. It's cleaner, fresher, and tastier than any buffet you've been to. As always, your best bet is to go on the weekend at dinner time for the best selection of food, and everything is kept very fresh."}
{"text":"Beautiful decor, well-lit, excellent choice for big family events. 

Pseudo-sushi is to be expected, but the food selection is huge.

Nice staff."}
{"text":"I took my mom there for dinner.  Something so disgusting happened I will never go back.  I wanted to get a crepe and went over the crepe station, rang the bell, the fellow came over, I asked for a crepe, he put the crepe batter on the griddle, or whatever it is called and then blew his nose.  He did not wash his hands. He did not even use hand sanitizer, nothing.  Even if he washed his hands or used hand sanitizer I would not have completed my order.  The fact that he did neither makes it even more gross. I told him that I changed my mind and that  I didn't  want one anymore.  What else in the restaurant did he touch without washing his hands or using hand sanitizer?  If he was sick I don't think he should be working where he could be exposing others to his germs.  I started feeling like I was coming down with something a short time later and by the next morning I had a full blown, bad cold.  I don't know for sure I got sick from there but in any case, that was so disgusting I will never go back there.  

There were other issue I was not happy with.. it was a hot day when we went, sat by the windows but it should not have been warm inside, even by the windows.   At least one of the handles in the buffet felt slimy/slippery.  Any good aspects of that dinner was overshadowed by that horrible experience of the nose blowing that took place."}
{"text":"I typically do not write Yelp reviews (although I am a loyal user), but this place simply has taken far too much of my time and money for me not to give them their props. This place is pure magic. I am ashamed, yet proud that I will undoubtedly spend about $500 here by year's end - as I eat here once a week. 

Now I know what you're thinking: \"All you can eat Sushi, Stir-fry, and Chinese?! Disgusting - I just can't imagine that being good.\" Get over yourself - it is delicious and always hits the spot. The potstickers - seared to perfection. The stir fry station - quick and fresh. The sushi - certainly not sushi rock quality, but it is freshly made in front of you and has a huge selection.

Kumo has a special place in my heart... and in my diet. Go there and you will not be sorry."}
{"text":"I am Chinese and I love this place! Especially during our last trip, they dropped the lunch price (to compete with the one across street) and added quite a few authentic items. I am not sure about those who complained about buffet food here. You got what you paid for and this place offers the best value for my money. It was clean with hot food. The service was good too. It has a lot of selections of seafood and authentic Chinese food. If you prefer \"fake\" and gross Chinese food with TONS of sugar, this is not your place. Otherwise, I would like to recommend this place strongly."}
{"text":"So, for the Gyro enthusiast, Steve's is the place!
TONS of meat on the regular or the jumbo
Amazing Taste.  So much garlic.
Fresh onion and tomato and a unique tzatziki on warm pita.
The line gets busy sometimes. So if you're in a rush, get their early.  It is cash only but for a stand in the Westside Markets, Steve's is spot on taste and quality"}
{"text":"Not much to say here.  Its a buffet.  When I go here, I feel guilty, but I eat.  I have stopped going because at the end of the day, its just too much food! Taste and food quality wise, Sushi is ok.  Much of the rest is simply fried or has too much oil for my liking.  You get what you pay for here and going to a buffett"}
{"text":"When it's bad it's bad.....went on a Thursday and had a large group 12.99 a person(and they say it's their special price and no discounts with that price).  Service was poor and the food was just not good.  It went from being great, not bad, to terrible.  within a short period of time since it's been there  When it first opened it was great but it's been on a slow decline.  Costing two more dollars then across the street's Fuji, is a crime.  Fuji's food is not only better but there is more variety and cheaper!.  I don't think this place will make it til the end of the year with very strong competition."}
{"text":"There were kids running around screaming the whole time.  We were so upset by it we left.  If the parents can't be bothered to watch them the restaurant should say something. If the policy here is kids running around the buffet screaming is the norm, then I'll pass. I basically spent $20 for one plate of beans and Lo mein. I don't even know if they have desert as I never made it that far. First and last time I'll visit."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. Interesting food choices, much different than any other Asian buffet I've ever visited. However, everything we tried was cold and hard. There was nothing worth redeeming at Kumo so we left. Very disappointing as this place was highly recommended by family members. Fuji Buffet across the street is standard fare Asian buffet fare but much better than this, so much for trying new things!"}
{"text":"Plethora of sushi, sashimi and seafood options! Huge selection of other food items as well including meat and dessert. Taste wise, it's similar to any other buffet food, not great but not bad. I, personally, didn't find any single food which is exceptional; yet my favorites include crayfish, grilled fish and their hot and sour soup. Having said that, I get that buffets cannot provide exceptional food for such a reasonable price. So no complaints! All the food trays were kept filling in quickly. The buffet area is nice and clean. They also have an icecream station, but all the flavors are mixed up as there was no person to serve. I didn't take any as it didn't look very clean to me (unlike rest of the buffet items).
The restaurant can hold quite a large capacity of people at one time. Restaurant is nice, clean and has a good ambience. Great place to go when you are craving sushi or seafood!"}
{"text":"If you read my reviews then you know that I usually have a lot to say, but this is by far the best Japanese seafood buffet I have ever had! Exceeds expectations, enough said! Look no further or you will be disappointed after eating at any other Japanese or Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"I love this place!! A friend took me here for my birthday and I have to say that I'm in love. I'm not a sushi person but I love it because of the wonderful vegetarian sushi options!! It was delicious! They even had tofu sushi!! Eat here please I beg you! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I expected better because I heard such great things about Kumo from friends.  
However I was really disappointed in the sushi selection.  
Everything seemed to have cream cheese and I hate cream cheese in my sushi. 
I got excited about the raw oysters, but every time I tried to slurp it, all this dirt and grime from the shell kept sneaking in =( they were very dirty. 
The dessert selection is uninspiring (just a bunch of pre frozen cakes that have been thawed and cut into little squares) and ice cream.  
The Crab Rangoon and the spicy octopus salad were really good.  
For the price I paid, I believe it was $17, I would say it is worth it.
However don't go in with high expectations like I did."}
{"text":"This is one of the better Chinese buffets that I've been to, it feels clean and the food comes out piping hot. 
There's also a sushi bar, obviously not the best but it's good enough for a buffet place."}
{"text":"I would love to give them 5 stars but I can't. I have been there for a couple of parties and on my own a few times. If you go when they are busy the food is great. If you go during a slow time it is pretty bad. When busy there is a quick turnover of food, when slow it seems to sit for a very long time and they are not willing to freshen it."}
{"text":"Dinner has more variety of seafood, only reason i went, and more variety than any other buffet i went to. Speedy service, and cleaning."}
{"text":"In general they have a good selection. Mostly Americanized Chinese food though. I like the crepe made fresh. The beef stew soup was very good! Some of the dessert fruity tapioca soup was nice too!"}
{"text":"First of all, this is not a Japanese buffet.  You won't find teriyaki chicken or tempura here.  This is a Chinese buffet that happens to have sushi and sashimi.

It's not bad.  Actually, like other reviewers have mentioned, it's probably the best sushi buffet in Northern Ohio.  If this restaurant were in Boston, it would get a three.  If it were in LA or NYC, it would get a two.

I went on a Sunday night, and it was fairly bustling with people, both Asian and non-Asian.  Because there were a good number of people, the sushi (or any food, for that matter) did not sit out for too long.  Plus, there was pretty decent variety.  As for the food, I thought the frog legs were quite tasty.  The rest of the food was sort of ho-hum, but again, it impressed me by Northeast Ohio standards."}
{"text":"Kumo has great foods, and great Sushi's as well. This is the only place I trust to get Sushi, otherwise I do not. Their staff is awesome, and kind. They have many Japanese foods, and desserts! One thing that I love about this place is that they have Crepes. I also love their noodles, they're made just-t-t right. And their rice is quality. Although, sometimes I might not like their food, it's still fine! And sometimes their staff might not make sense, but the manager always comes out and explains the whole problem. Now, I might see you post 4 stars, this why I came here for 5 stars, their price is AWESOME if you are getting the quality food.

Known & Served Desserts: Ice Cream and Crepes.

Known & Served Foods: Spring Rolls, Meat Rolls, Sushi, Noodles, Rice, & More!

That is my review,

{"text":"It's amazing how unreasonable some people are. You get what you pay for. The food is decent, service is good, and the selection is adequate. Normally I'd give three stars, but the atmosphere is pretty awesome. 
They also have a stir fry station."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went on a Friday around 4:30 p.m. We enjoyed our meal and the selection of items. Unfortunately for him he spent the whole night in the bathroom with food poisoning!!!"}
{"text":"The food is ok. They  have more of a sushi selection compared to Watami... less sashimi but the hot food is better. They make udon and crepes for you and have raw oysters which are pretty good. I think it should cost less for the dinner price~
The seafood is good."}
{"text":"Simply put, Kumo's Asian and Japanese buffet has to be seen to be believed. The restaurant is open and spacious. The staff is quick and friendly. Choose from about 50 dishes and selections in about 7-8 rows of food. The sushi table is about 20 feet long with hundreds of sushi rolls. I like the Crunchy California Roll. The food is steaming hot and delicious. Mango Chicken, General Tso's Chicken, Szechuan green beans, Vegetable Lo Mein, Pepper Steak and on and on. They keep the food hot and trays full. For $8.63 lunch buffet,  I had 3 giant plates of delicious Chinese food. My colleagues and I stop in together for lunch."}
{"text":"Great selection of food. I was very happy with the variety of sushi. You will not leave there hungry thats for sure! I would say even those who do not think they like this type of food. Try it. You may be quite suprised!"}
{"text":"Pricey!!! But this is definitely the best Japanese restaurant i have been to. The ambiance is nice and the food is hot. Their selection of food is what makes this place the go to spot for Japanese food."}
{"text":"My boyfriend's review addressing the sanitary concerns of this restaurant was shafted off to the not recommended reviews-- VERY SHIFTY. We felt bad about posting it, because we aren't trying to harm someone's business, but deliberately trying to hide an honest review is not cool. This was our first visit to Kumo:

\"My girlfriend and I only went there for the all you can eat crabs legs. It started when we found out that they only served the crabs cold, that was bad enough. After we struggled to get over that sad issue it only got worse with a big COCKROACH running across our table. I had one of the servers grab a manager for us so we could inform them before we left. Conveniently the floor manager was not there, but the kitchen manager came to our aid instead. I explained to him what we saw and he wasn't surprised to hear the news at all.\""}
{"text":"I want to Kumo Japanese seafood buffet for lunch today. There was food everywhere probably 24 to 38 types of sushi, 2 to 3 different types of shrimp, spicy octopus and fried squid as well as more typical Chinese style food. The salad bar was amazing and there was ample dessert choices. All in all for about $10 a person it was an amazing meal. Everything was fresh hot and delicious. I would deathly recommend checking this place out and I would gladly eat there again"}
{"text":"Four stars for value.  Kumo Buffet is one of the bigger Asian buffets located in the Cleveland area.  For an Asian buffet, the food quality is pretty good.

I used to go to Kumo a lot for dinner on the weekends with my friends.  Recently, I've realized that it's only $10 if you go for lunch on the weekdays. 

While lunch (as expected) doesn't give you as many options as dinner, the assortment is still pretty good.  They recently started serving dim sum for lunch. The sushi assortment is respectable for lunch hour.  At dinner, there are more different nigiri (the two times I've been to lunch, they've only had shrimp and white fish nigiri).  And the rolls get more creative at dinner.  Is it five star sushi?  No.  Is it better than the sushi served at most Japanese seafood buffets?  Definitely yes.  I've never looked at the fish and questioned if it was fresh enough to eat.  Another difference I've noticed between lunch and dinner is the number of hot seafood items - at dinner there are more varieties of steamed  fish, whole fish, and crawfish.

The dessert section could use a little improvement.  But otherwise, a decent place to really fill up on cheap seafood."}
{"text":"KUMO is my pick for AUCE buffet in Cleveland area.  I gave KUMO a 4 star overall, for an all you can eat (AUCE) buffet, the sushi itself should be just 3 because of the quality and quantities.  They have variation of rolls, but not enough nirigi.  
However, there are a lot of cold appetizers (shrimp cocktail, snow crab leg & mussel).  There is a large variety of hot food selection including: two different steam fish, crawfish, frog leg, crab, two different types of clam, duck, etc.     Besides the clients select Mongolian BBQ, the nicest touch is the Japanese Udon noodle.  At the end, a cup of the green tea ice-cream is perfect for finishing the evening.  I will go there just for their hot plates, the sushi is the plus, money well worth for dinner under 16 buck"}
{"text":"Good Sushi bar.  Best day to go is on monday.  They are the cheapest than.  Each day after monday they raise the buffet price every day with sundays being the most expensive.  Its my opinion that if you can make a profit on your buffet for what you charge on monday they that is what you should charge on sunday as well.  Also I like raw oyster.  Just like them to be cleaned before they are put out.  Did not appreciate the mouth full of sand."}
{"text":"First off, this is a review comparing Watami and Kumo. it's just my opinion also, so go try them both yourself. But yeah, first time here, It's an alright place, and pretty much similar to Watami, but has a way bigger selection. The food seemed hot, and it was pretty good. There's a ton of seating, and it has a really cool Asian atmosphere...way more than Watami has. Desert to octopus to pig stomach, they have a lot. Despite the Japanese label, they have tons of Chinese food, sort of like Watami, but Watami has less food overall.

I only really liked the sushi and chicken, and even then it was only the mango chicken. I like all kinds of sushi, but the ones that I liked had a weird taste when comparing it to Watami.. The atmosphere is pretty normal. People casual talking, ambient Asian music in the background, and all that jazz.

Watami is farther away from me, and I'd pretty much rather drive there for an extra 5 minutes instead of go here. Maybe it's just an alright first experience, but who knows. I'll be coming back most likely to compare the two restaurants again in the later days."}
{"text":"I'm usually torn on rating buffets because you have to decide whether to rate is as a four out of five stars for a buffet or to proclaim that it is a four star restaurant. Kumo gets the four stars overall, which is rare for a buffet. The place is clean and presentation is great. Seating area is a bit tight, but large. Price is great ($8 or $9 for lunch). The parking lot and restaurant front looks nondescript or unappealing. The food is surprisingly good and the selection is what seals the deal. 
It's weird to have a Japanese, Chinese, American buffet, but Kumo pulls it off well. You can choose sushi rolls, crepes, General Tso's, or American cuisine. They prepare hibachi style bowls to while you wait and have great soup selections. Give Kumo a visit and you aren't likely to regret it. Yes, it's a buffet and the food isn't as piping hot and fresh as a made-to-order restaurant, but care is taken to make it as close as possible. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Pretty good restaurant. I have been looking for a good buffet in northeast Ohio. And looks like a found a good one here. Lunch is cheap and there is a huge selection of food. Haibachi is ok, the sushi is great and the buffet is quite good. I recommend this to anyone"}
{"text":"My family and others love making the drive from Akron to come eat here but I don't think it's worth it. The ABSOLUTE best thing they have here is their coconut jello. It's basic but it's BOMB! Their seafood selection is simply the same thing packaged in various ways. It's meh. Sushi is meh. They do offer dim sum but it's meh.

If you just want to see seafood redressed in many ways, come here. I love crawfish and it's more basic than basic here. Pretty sad."}
{"text":"I was introduced to Kumo by a friend and I am so happy with them. We live about 40 minutes away but make sure to go every couple weeks. Sunday, they have Dim Sum. The offerings are great. There is so much to choose from. They have the hibachi grill, udon soup station, sushi, about 8-10 different soups, both hot and cold, seafood, many different fish dishes and a few things you usually don't find outside Chinatown. They make these crispy intestines. I will say, I saw them & thought there is no way I'm trying those! My husband and I sat down and I was inspecting his plate. I reached over and grabbed what looked to be a piece of sausage. Well, guess what it was! Yes, the intestines. They were so good that I went back for two more servings and look for them every trip. Another odd but amazing dish is the fish ball soup. I like to just take some of the fish balls and drop them into my bowl of miso soup. The nigiri sushi is rather small, but they do offer sashimi which I would rather have anyway. They have a crepe station by the desserts but I have. Ever left enough room for one. The little mousse cups are really light and tasty though. I've not been disappointed with Kumo and alway look forward to dinner there."}
{"text":"Been going to Kumo twice a week since they opened. The staff is fast and courteous. The sushi changes dinner to dinner. There is plenty for none sushi eaters."}
{"text":"After hearing some of my friends to visit this buffet. I was very impressed with the sushi selections. There weren't any sashmi at all on Friday night. One good sign is a lot of Asian eating in the restaurant, so that tells you of some interest. The sushi buffet have fair good selection. The rice is ok. a little dry for my taste. A little more seasoning needed. The spicy mini octopus was great. The Kimchi is really good. On the back corner of the buffet, there was a Udon Noodle station together with the Japanese crepe station. I was too full to try Udon. The seafood selection is pretty decent. The frog leg was a little dry for me.  I normally like it sauteed in black bean sauce as opposed to fried. The salmon was a little too done for me. Fried Tilapia in bean sauce didn't try it. I tried ginger fish and it was good. I tried the ginger crab and it was really good. The shell was not quite soft shell but soft enough to munch on it. The cold browned beef tripe is really good. Something in my first time in Asian buffet I never seen before, 5 spiced braised pig feet. It was delicious. Hit the comfort food spot for Asian. Also usual soup like pork spare rib soup and duck with taro soup that you see in Asian buffet food. some standard fair of fried rice, lo mein, white rice, wonton soup and all that. Raw oysters, cold crab legs, peel and eat shrimp. The one I really enjoyed is the crawfish in spicy broth. I was impressed by the buffet. It's not the best in all things but few items on the buffet will definitely keep me going back. 

You also can do a take out by the pound. different price for sushi and regular buffet.

I couldn't check-in on that night, the area didn't have any wi-fi and 4G."}
{"text":"Many of my favorite items all lined up and neatly presented. Tuna, salmon and shrimp on pillows of rice, many sushi rolls to choose from, spicy octopus,
seaweed salad...again, all very well presented and kudos for the cleanliness. Presentation and cleanliness is where the positive attributes sadly end. All food was mediocre at best. Too salty, under-spiced, overcooked or too long under the heat lamp and morphing into dry piles of YUCK!!!  My best comparison would be a Ponderosa buffet with Asian foods replacing the meatloaf, mashed potatoes, iceberg salad bar and soggy canned green beans.  If you're looking for TONS of less-than- average food and indifferent about the taste and quality, Kumo is the place for you. If you're looking for a decent meal with tasteful, well-prepared  food, do yourself a favor and look past Kumo."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I am not a huge seafood fan -- i went because I told my parents chinese buffet for dinner and this place had enough food for them to be happy.

With that said, I found there to be just enough of the traditional \"Chinese buffet\" food for a guy with an unsophisticated pallet like myself to be very happy. Lots, lots, lots of seafood and other unique entries like pig intestines. One thing they have on saturday nights is peking duck, but it was tucked back near the desserts so I did not even see it until I was full up. They have  make your own dessert crepe, stir fry, and noodle stations, to go along with a large dessert bar and sushi station. Overall, a good place with large selection."}
{"text":"Kumo is seriously one of the best buffets featuring oriental food that I have ever tried!  They even have a Pho soup station in the back!  It's not to give Kumo 5 stars but it is a buffet and sometimes the same item(s) can be different on separate occasions.  For example,  the dumplings on one occasion where moist and filling while another time they were hard, dry and you had to pull apart the dumplings with your teeth and the chicken wings can differ as well.  But that's not to say they don't have good food, they do and as of writing this review the early bird lunch special for $7.99 is one of the BEST DEALS IN TOWN!  When my roommate and I don't feel like cooking, we just go to Kumo.  It's a buffet, you will not leave hungry.  
     Overall, a decent environment to eat with bathrooms that are kept up creating an overall nice atmosphere for everyone (at least the times I've been there but there is one toilet in the ladies room that constantly flushes).  Kumo even has a take out menu as well for those who can't stay.  I will definitely be eating here again and probably sometime soon."}
{"text":"As good as expected! I have never been to a bad sushi buffet and this was just as good. The place is very clean and all the food is displaying exceptionally well. I had 4 plates of different foods and I finished all of it. I was looking forward to the green tea ice cream and it met my expectations. The sushi was fresh and delicious. I just can't give it less than 5 stars because I thought everything was prepared to perfection. Some of my dining companions didn't enjoy it, but I thought it was great!"}
{"text":"This place has got the biggest buffet spread of Asian food in town if I'm not mistaken. The moment you enter, you will be amazed by the multiple rows of food on offer. 
No matter how hungry you are, I'm more than sure you won't be able to taste everything 
I came here during lunch hours with a colleague of mine as he kept praising their sushi and I'm glad I listened to him. These guys offer a variety of sushi and since it is a part of the buffet, you can eat as much as you can... 
a must try if you are in the town looking for good Japanese and Asian food

6/13/218: I happened to come here again with a colleague for lunch. This time, I tried their non-Sushi dishes :) Their hot and sour soup was a delicious.
I tried General Tso's chicken, Mango chicken, Singapore chicken, crab Rangoon and spring roll and liked all of them. Mango chicken was awesome and so was Singapore chicken. 
This is the first time I tried crab Rangoon and found it nice. I will have to try it at other places to run a comparison. 
Th only item I did not like was Buttered potato as it was tooooo salty for my liking. It had almost double the amount of salt I'd eat normally.

Overall a good experience and for $11ish, it is a real good deal."}
{"text":"I'd say this place toys on the more authentic side of buffets in the area. They have an udon noodle station, hibachi station, dim sum counter (try the steamed buns), normal Chinese food, and a ton of sushi options. 

The sushi is some of the best neo buffet sushi I've had. So many fresh options. I also like that the rolls are smaller and not gargantuan. The chinese food is pretty decent but nothing stand out. The crab legs and oysters for dinner were awesome and huge, blew away my expectations. This is one of the better buffets in the area."}
{"text":"I have been to a number of Japanese and Chinese buffets.  This one is pretty good.  The decor is probably a little better than average.  The food is better than average.  Given that there is \"seafood\" in the name, the choices of seafood is better than most.  They have large and small clams.  Several varieties of fish.  A couple of different shrimp dishes.  And of course, the snow crab legs--OK, but don't seem to be salty enough (ie. excessively boiled instead of steamed) and not brought out enough.  They also have a few sashimi and about 10 sushi selections--just don't count on sampling any sashimi because they hardly ever bring any out!  There also seems to be a small Mongolian BBQ station but I didn't see any takers and wonder about the ingredient freshness.  And you can get crepes made or Udon noodle soup (in addition to 3 other soup choices).  As for service, not the greatest, which is typical of asian eateries.  At times the plates piled up before being cleared away and it may take some time before your drink gets refiled.  Still, you would be hard pressed to find a better Asian Buffet in the NE Ohio area if you like seafood.  I will only suggest Yellow Tail in Fairlawn as being slightly better."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great sushi selection and it is always fresh. I would recommend Kumo over that Fuji place across the street any day!"}
{"text":"Caution! Caution! Caution! Warning: Me and my girlfriend went here for the Sunday buffet. We were feeling in the mood for a Japanese buffet. I got multiple pieces of bone in the bread pork (kinda looked like general tso's). If I wasn't careful I could of broken a tooth. The chicken was a little cold. The fried rice wasn't bad. The soup tasted like dirty water. The sushi was ok at best. The desserts looked good, but after feeling so disgusted by the food we could barely even try the ice cream. You've been warned. We decided after this never again. Not this buffet, no Chinese, Japanese buffet. I hate writing such a negative review, but I feel like I got ripped off. The buffet for 2 ended up being $36. Absolute highway robbery."}
{"text":"Went for lunch loved it!  I would have paid $8 for the sushi buffet alone.  Wide selection of Asian food, clean buffet tables and friendly staff."}
{"text":"First time visited this buffet on April 6, 2013, we were so impressed that we started visiting it basically every week or every other weekend. I guess we are creatures of habit. 

Let me tell you, we love this place. The decor is so charming, the waiters are friendly and the food is very tasty with a very large selection. We enjoyed the hibachi, loved all of the sushi and the prepared food was very tasty. The service is always very nice and welcoming. You can tell how good the place is by how busy the place is. 

I definitely encourage anyone to try it! You will probably not be disappointed. I mean where can you get all of this sushi, habachi and other food selections for such a great price?!"}
{"text":"Love this place!   They have a very large sushi section. ...just about everything you could want!   The regular buffet area was also good with a large selection.   Wait staff good and prices are moderate."}
{"text":"Horrid place. Service is terrible. Went in at 845 pm. This place was supposed to be open until 10pm. Workers started to remove food and pull up floor mats at 850pm. The food was terrible. Not sure how the health department has not shut this disgusting place down. Workers are screaming and complaining about going home. I had 3 plates but hardly ate anything on the 3 plates. Tried to find something edible but couldn't stomach any of it. Paid about 18$ for the dinner. Horrible place. Try at your own risk!!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I've been coming here since I was a kid, they always treat my family like family! It was great when it was Hong Kong Buffet and its even better as Kumo! Everything has expanded immensely and the quality is always great! I am always amazed at how busy it is there, and yet there is never a wait and they work so hard to make everyone feel at home and like family!"}
{"text":"I must say I was pleasantly surprised when I first went to this Asian buffet restaurant. I'm not a fan of Chinese food. I do like buffets because I'm the person to always pick the worst thing on the menu! Really! So buffets work much better for me.  
They have a huge variety of seafood and traditional western foods, so if squid and shrimp are not your thing, you'll find plenty of chicken, meat, and veggies.  I gotta say the chicken in the buffet area was not the best, tastes like leftovers, that's why I gave 4 stars.  
But I absolutely love the hibachi area where you pick your meats and veggies and it gets cooked right in front of you.
I can't comment on the dessert area since I didn't try it. All in all, a very good place to go for inexpensive eats."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've been eating at Kumo for five years!  Wow!  Where does time go?  Anyway, we love this buffet's quality and size.  There is a tremendous selection of food items.  I am writing an update because they recently expanded their buffet offerings.  They managed to squeeze in a couple more buffet tables to increase the quantity of food, as if there wasn't enough before!

It's affordable, tasty, local, and therefore, we'll keep coming back.

Love."}
{"text":"I don't know if I should give this place a three or four, but considering it's price $15 per person during the week (I think a little more if you go over the weekend), I decided to give it a four star.

Things I like: 
Cheap! Very cheap!
Surface parking lot available
Fresh crepe station
Lots of asian american food

Things I don't like:
Sushi quality is pretty bad - they are usually not that fresh. The sushi makers also don't make them that often and you may have to wait for a long time till you get your favorite ones.
Seafood is very limited - I really like king crab legs but they are SO limited at this restaurants. Almost stingy. Customers just waited in their seats till someone take out 10 more legs and EVERYBODY stood up to fight for the few legs. It was a little pathetic. Their raw oysters were not the freshest either but I mean it's a pretty cheap buffet place, so I didn't expect any high quality raw oysters.

Overall, a great place to go if you want to get real full without breaking your bank, but if you are looking for quality seafood, I would suggest you going somewhere else."}
{"text":"For the pros. 
Nice selection of sushi. 
Very clean. 
Good service. 
A lot of Asians eating there. Always a good sign. 
Cons...
Food was not hot at all. The steam wells were working fine but the lights above were not heat lamps so food cooled quickly. This was a suprise because they were busy. 

It was decent.  Just not 5 stars."}
{"text":"So many amazing all-you-can-eat selections! Sushi, Hibachi, Crepe station, etc. Will definitely be going back again... and again... and again!"}
{"text":"Kumo is a great place for anyone who wants to eat mass quantities of food! The buffet style gives you the ability to enjoy standard Asian dishes (fried rice, lo mein, General Tsos) as well as some Japanese seafood dishes you don't see everywhere (ginger fish, deep fried crustaceans). The flavors can vary slightly from visit to visit (some days better than others) but the variety is great. While you get more seafood options during dinner hours, I think the price point during lunch is the better deal."}
{"text":"Went here a few months ago with my daughter. I love buffets but this was bad. The sushi was not fresh and the different chicken dishes were so tough my daughter who is 13 could not chew it. I tried and it was so rubbery. We actually left hungry and went to the Sonic across the street to eat."}
{"text":"First off I am not a buffet person at all, some people love them some people hate them. While I don't hate them, I'm not particularly fond of them. Kumo seems to be clean and staff is friendly. The food was okay, I had a variety of things, calamari, whelk, sushi, general tsos chicken, broccoli and chicken, shrimp, frog legs, crawfish and more. The sushi is not bad for being buffet sushi, seems to be fresh and of decent quality, however with this being a buffet and certain foods, like calamari, shrimp, whelk, since these foods do sit for a period of time they become chewy and not so appetizing. The food quality wasn't bad but it's wasn't particularly good. I did somewhat enjoy my meal but not sure if I were to come back easily."}
{"text":"Kumo is one of my favorite places to grab lunch in the Independence area. The sushi is decent enough and the cost to value ratio is exceptional. I brought my friend here for his first time today and he was impressed. They have a sign up that they will be now serving dim sum as part of the buffet! This could be a game changer in the dim sum scene of Cleveland. If anybody tries it before I do, let me know how it is. They said that they will be having the dim sum in a buffet case and will not wheel it around in carts."}
{"text":"It's a buffet, what else is there to say.  If you're fat you will love it no matter what the quality of food is.  The fishy smell was a bit overwhelming when we first walked in and it reminded me of the girls locker room in junior high school.  If you want quantity and not quality then you've just found heaven.   This place made me squirt mud for 2 days."}
{"text":"What i great buffet place, food wise and environment wise!!!! Its high class! Honestly the best in Cleveland.  Ive tried many Chinese places around here and none can compare to this one."}
{"text":"Okay I didn't expect this place to have amazing food but I was definitely surprised at how bad it was. The sushi specifically. Most of the rolls were poorly made and falling apart. But none of them were fresh at all. The avocado in the Cali rolls were brown, like they were sitting out since the day before. The rice was super chewy and hard too. It was just bad. I paid $15 to take a few bites of bad sushi and then settle for eating a pile of rice with chicken that would be about $7 from any other Chinese place. Definitely not worth it."}
{"text":"Went here because of the good reviews. Probably one of the largest buffets I have ever been to. That said it was a sea of mediocrity and in many cases below that. Everything seemed to have a bitter dry after taste. I don't know about you but I like cherrystone clams with hot drawn butter not swimming in steamed water. Same thing for the crab legs served cold instead of hot. The Tamaki rolls were stuffed with Hellmans mayonnaise. The wonton soup was inedible. How do you screw up wonton soup? The biggest wontons I have ever seen but absolutely the weirdest taste imaginable. I can honestly say in the entire buffet not one item stood out that was worth eating. I take it back the green tea ice cream was very good but by that time I was so disappointed I was no longer interested. I can't see all the hoopla in this place. I could have went to lowly McDonalds and had a better meal."}
{"text":"This place was awesome, very decent sushi surprisingly and a good variety too. Desserts were plentiful, make youre own salad bar and good food buffet also. Big so it wont keep you waiting and the lines move fast. Service for plate pickup was in a timely manner also. Ill definitely be returning here someday."}
{"text":"This is an awesome new Chinese buffet in the 'ville. Ordinarily I pass on any variety of buffet, but everyone should give this place a try. Where else can you get a shrimp tempura roll, tuna roll, spicy crab salad, potstickers, edamame, green beans, asparagus, crab rangoon, black pepper chicken, Szechwan chicken, dumplings, and squid all for $10? Oh yeah, and desserts. And did I mention I liked everything on my plate?"}
{"text":"Was hoping this place was real fancy based on the reviews but its pretty average.  Sushi was why I came and it was definitely very \"buffet level\" meh. Selection was decent but food tasted very generic. I. From NY and honestly you would not be able to tell a difference from an average grade Chinese buffet. Maybe I was hoping for more since the only restaurants labeled seafood buffets are wayyyy more higher end buffets."}
{"text":"Average buffet food. Average cleanliness. Average service. 3/5. Not bad if you enjoy stuffing your face (don't we all like doing this occasionally?) and sacrificing in the food quality and experience. The condensation on the inside of the windows is a bit unappetizing. Mostly everything else met my expectations for averages."}
{"text":"I've been to a number of buffets in the area simply because I enjoy sampling many different items. Kumo is by far the best Chinese/Japanese buffet in the area. $14.99 for dinner is an exceptionally reasonable price considering the array of seafood choices such as crab legs, oysters, clams and shrimp. I haven't even mentioned the sushi yet. There were at least 20 different rolls to choose from including hand rolls and nigiri. Next time, I will save room for the udon noodle bowl that's freshly prepared when ordered."}
{"text":"I realllyy really wish this buffet could be transported close to where I live...$8 for lunch buffet and its pretty darn good. Lotsa of msg still, but whatever, a good selection of sushi and Chinese dishes...and I can't believe the price! Even for dinner it is only $15. 

This place is nice and clean and the decoration isn't too over the top. Plenty of seats inside and so much food selection. I definitely didn't try everything they had there. They easily accomodated for our group of 25, we did call ahead though as a warning. My entire family likes this place, which is quite a hard thing to say from grandma down to the little babies (tho okay they don't really have that much of an opinion as they eat whatever). The service was also really good, we had our drinks readily refilled and our dirty plates taken away pretty quickly.

And now for the food...lots of different varieties of sushi, freshly made crepes, udon, mongolian bbq, different japanese salads and appetizers, lotus root with sweet rice, 4 kinds of soups (hot and sour and egg drop as the usuals), general tso's chicken, sweet and sour chicken, chinese donuts, octopus, fried squid, steamed fish, lotsa veggies, etc etc etc etc etc. It's really hard to remember it all really. I think my mind just goes into food frenzy and I just eat eat eat.

For the price, there's a really good amount of food and the quality is good. It's hard to find a decent buffet for this kind of price. In LA you could, but I would prolly end up paying more money."}
{"text":"Atmosphere- it's a buffet so don't expect excellent ambience. 

Service- A, everyone was so prompt with clearing away dishes and refilling the drinks. 

Food- for what it is, the quality is better than some places. I'm not a big buffet person and only came because a family member was adamant about coming here."}
{"text":"If I'm comparing this place to other buffet restaurants, it gets a 4, but if I'm comparing to restaurants overall, it's a 2. I'm trying to equivocate by settling on a 3. 

Let me start by saying buffet restaurants just aren't my thing. The large quantities of food sitting out under hot lamps makes me nauseous just thinking about it. I also never feel that I can eat enough to get my dollars' worth, especially at a place like this where the price per person is between $14-$17. My boyfriend's family on the other hand absolutely loves it here and often chooses this place for family events. I swear they cheat the system by finding a way to eat way more than their $17 worth, and you really can do that here because of options like shellfish and sushi which would normally be much more expensive given the quantity elsewhere.

That being said, for a buffet, this place really is a cut above the rest. It's very clean inside even when busy, the staff are exceedingly pleasant, and they really do have every option under the sun when it comes to Asian food. They have a large sushi bar, a whole row of different braised fish options, Americanized Chinese dishes, an udon noodle bar, a crepe bar, roast duck, steamed shellfish, a sprawling dessert counter with a variety of fruits, pastries, jellies and ice cream. they even have dim sum on Sundays..... I could go on and on. 

However, I mention this with the disclaimer that this is a buffet. You are paying for the quantity of food, not the quality. Therefore, I try not to be too dismayed when I find that the dishes aren't really all that flavorful or well cooked. It's not poor by any means, but again, it really depends on where your place value on the meal you get here. I found the sauced fish dishes to be surprisingly good, but other things were just mediocre. 

I'll say that if you like seafood and you like buffets, you'll probably absolutely love it here. If you're looking for a high quality meal however, you'd best spend your $17 elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is, by far, the best buffet I have ever been to and the price is reasonable. Their sashimi and sushi options are abundant and always fresh. Six or more soup options, cold seafood, hot dishes from chicken and broccoli to ginger crab. Traditional dishes like fried rice, lo mein, crab Rangoon, egg rolls, and Chinese donuts. All of this and beyond! My 8 year old son will make it a point to try something new every time we go and there are so many items on the buffet, that's exactly what he does! But his first stop is a plate full of sushi..."}
