{"text":"Authentic Northern Chinese cuisine.  Excellent dumplings and steamed pork buns.  Noodles were great.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that they didn't have crispy rice (wor-bah), one of my favourite dishes.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I love lamb on a stick and this restaurant is my go-to place for this. They have a wide variety of northern style Chinese dishes. I've been here a number of times and every tasted good, albeit on the spicy side. What really stood out was the punch they packed in their lamb skewers. They pack a power punch of spice and flavor, and you can't do better anywhere else in Mississauga."}
{"text":"Amazing food! And cooked quickly. I go for their jelly fish, deep fried shredded potatos, egg plant and soup. Sometimes we also go for noodles or beef wraps."}
{"text":"Food tastes really bad. Totally waste of money. Avoid it if you can! Congee is the only acceptable dish we had. Most things are very salty. Some are not what we would expect as the name shows. We came in just to try it out. Around 11:30, the place was still empty. Guess that's a sign. We had to go to another restaurant afterward. Don't know how it can survive."}
{"text":"Ownership changed again!! 3 times in the last few years!! I had the beef noodle soup, it was ok, nothing to write home about. The neighbor table had hot-pot, they looked pretty happy... I guess we'll just wait and see"}
{"text":"You have been warned: Eat at this restaurant only if you have time to spare!
It's a very mom-and-pop shop, run by a small family. We arrived at 12:00pm, ordered, and were unable to leave the restaurant until roughly 1:30pm. That being said, we found the quality of the food to be quite decent.

We ordered one of their lunch sets - xiaolong bao with millet congee. The set came with a side of pickled potatoes and a tea egg. The potatoes were slightly spicy and quite addicting, but the millet congee fell flat in flavour. The xiaolong bao were all right, but I found the wrapping to be slightly thick.

We also ordered a lamb soup with pita bread. The soup was very delicious, but the pita tasted slightly stale. I'm not entirely sure if it is supposed to be like this, but it came very hard and took a while to soften up in the soup. The process may have been quickened if the broth was hotter, but alas...

Finally, we finished our meal with steamed lamb dumplings. Again, the wrapping was a bit thick, but the lamb dumplings were so meaty and juicy! It was very yummy and I would probably order this again... If it didn't take over an hour for it to arrive.

Tldr; good food, but takes a long time."}
{"text":"Ordered the Mah Po and Chili Spiced Chicken with Won Ton Soup. 

The Mah Po had very little minced pork but was very spicy, just felt ripped off being charged $8.99 for tofu.   The chicken did not taste like chicken ad had a ridiculous amount of peppers cooked in it and wasn't spicy, still scratching head on that one.  

The won ton soup was the surprise dish.  Freshly made  with fresh chives and came out bubbling in a crock hotpot.  I would order it again if I were planning to come back to this place again."}
{"text":"I picked up my boyfriend from Pearson and decided that eating within the area would probably be better than to try to brave the traffic back downtown. So we ended up in the plaza of where this place was located and just randomly picked a place to try. This restaurant features Northern Chinese food. Overall, I would say the food was average and the pricing of their menu is on par to other restaurants of this style of Chinese food."}

Full Review:
Arrived at Xin restaurant after having our original lunch spot had no tables in a decent waiting time. We were quickly seated and the waitress is attentive. We ordered beef chunky noodle soup, chive dumpling, hot and sour soup and shredded pork noodle. The review is written on  the Andriod phone. A new paragraph represents an update during my experience.

The shredded pork and the chunky beef arrived quickly. The shredded pork soup was bland and did not have much flavour.  The chunky beef was spicy but was average and did not impress. 

The chive dumpling was the best dish. It had lots of flavour and tasted amazing. The hot and sour soup had a strong bamboo taste and made the dish unappetizing to my taste. The bolay tea was bland and did not taste good.

Overall, our experience at Xin Xin was below average. The service was subpar and the food was poor. I would not recommend this restaurant. I'm glad to have tried this restuarant but I'm not impressed with its performance."}
{"text":"OK. Let's start with the fact that I ordered a whole wack of food, and it started coming to my table fast and furious. And it was gooooood.

I came here with four other friends and we ordered a total of nine different dishes. Every single one of them were good. We had from noodles to beef, lamb and shrimp skewers to been sprouts and beyond. We almost finished everything. All that was left on the table were three skewers and some soup. With that we all had beer (always nice when that's available) and the total at the end of the night was about $80. 

But the food was good, and so was the staff. Am I going back you ask? Short answer yes. Long answer yeeeeeees."}
