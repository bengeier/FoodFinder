{"text":"I'm so happy with the service here! My waitress Lindsey was the best!!!! Best review for this place, would for sure come here again. Love this place actually!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Reading the other reviews might have scared me off if the direction for pre-dance party drinks hadn't been for something close to the venue.  But I loved the idea of a speakeasy style bar.  You walk into the storefront and 3 people are there to greet - if you didn't know what you were there for, you might miss the whole bar.  I ask for a table for 6.  Since it was only for pre-activity drinks we were only staying for an hour or so.  So when the hostess offered a table that was reserved later in the evening, and I said we'd be gone by then, we snagged a table right away.  Walking passed the plastic curtain (might have been more interesting if they were beads), your eyes take a moment to adjust to the dark cavernous resto/bar in the back.  Tables line the sides of the room with a long bar in the back.  Lots of space in the middle for mingling. We were seated in the front with some eclectic armchair and couch combinations.  Really cool!  I'm suddenly thinking how cool it would be to have a party here, but was disappointed to hear their capacity was only 96.  The wait staff was attentive.  3 people came to drop water off to  the table at the start.  Drinks are all really interesting.  The wine options should have offered for a larger glass (5oz/9oz/bottle options) but only offered the 5 oz option.  One of my friends ordered the Writers Tears... that's an idea... come back to write and drink whiskey in this secret environment.  They also have Kona beer by the bottle.  I'm sold!  Hawaiian beer and Writers Tears? That's the beginning of an amazing screenplay in my world!  I also tried the Braised Beef and Shanghai noodles with Sichuan sauce.  Spicy and delicious, although the noodles tasted a little undercooked.  But the spice in the sauce overrode the floury taste. Would definitely come back to try the other menu items and some Writers Tears."}
{"text":"Meh. Was excited to go, but disappointed in the end. Nothing fancy. All hype. Food was good. I ended up ordering a Coors?!?! Really...? Wasn't impressed with beer selection."}
{"text":"This place was way too cool for me - as in, I'm not cool enough to even have gone there!  I walk by all the time, during the day, when looking in it looks like a little convenience store.  Very unassuming. We showed up around 930 pm on a Saturday, and we put our names on a waitlist for a table, which we didn't need, because there was plenty of space at the bar.  (when they phoned us with our table, we just said we were okay at the bar)  The bartender was friendly and easy going, very pleasant staff all around.  The space was incredulously loud, screaming the entire time, which we thought was odd but we didn't realize this place turns into a nightclub!  I saw the little sign that said, Dinner drinks dancing, and had commented, \"Dancing?\"  Well, at midnight, lo and behold, they take away the barstools and everyone was grinding up all over each other.  The clientele was a mix of King Street vibes and hipster, but everyone was really nice and in a really good mood. The music was good.  Drinks and beer selection excellent.  I had a great time!  Bathrooms are annoyingly down a flight of stairs, which I am not sure is a great idea, and only two toilets in the women's so prepare to stand around."}
{"text":"Fun spot, great space and cool vibe. Good for a stop if your out on the town for drinks. If there's a line it moves pretty fast!   Decent drink menu and good service."}
{"text":"Nice speakeasy feeling bar. Cool decor and ambience.   Drinks are pricier but worth trying (I recommend the dirty money)   Food items aren't my favourite but has a nice kick to them.  (chilli oil with dumplings)"}
{"text":"Very disappointing . Service was terrible . We were told our table would take us an hour , 2 and a half hours later we still don't have a table. We were A party of 7 so we understand big tables can take time. After waiting at the bar we noticed a table for our size was sitting empty for over 20 Minutes and we still hadn't got a call For our table. After being fed up of standing for 2 and half hours we seated ourselves at the table. Almost immediately we were reprimanded , told it was someone else's table . But no one showed up. Then the server came back twice to question us about sitting there. They would rather have an empty table than seat people who waited two and half hours to get a table. Not worth the hype."}
{"text":"The front looks like a dispensary but you are pleasantly surprised when you enter!  It's all about the Mahjong Half Moons. Prefer the pork over mushrooms.  Reasonably priced, good music and fun atmosphere!"}
{"text":"This is a great spot! We had a little tee-hee moment when passing thru the curtain to find the bar at the back. Nice bar staff and good cocktails. Re food, the spring rolls were divine, and the shrimp wontons good but expect some overpowering heat.  Or head to the shop at the front to sit on a bar stool facing Dundas with a tasty spiked slushie.  Would def go back."}
{"text":"I like finding hidden bars and there's no way I will miss out on this one. The facade is a great concept as it's behind a convenience store. The store is easy to spot on Dundas as it's the only on who has bright neon pink lights. My friends and I went in and wala! There's a complete bar world that is definitely not obvious from outside.  I came here on a Thursday night after dinner with friends so we were just here to grab drinks. The staff was chill and the music was upbeat but not too mainstream. They have a dancefloor so I'd imaging this place gets packed on weekends. The interior is nicely decorated and hipster-ish (yasss gurl) and the lights are dim which is typical for a bar. I ordered Peach Panther and yes, they don't cheap out on the alcohol in there. Definitely coming back here to hide and drink!"}
{"text":"A great speak-easy to wow your friends for sure! The front has kind of a LA corner store vibes to it and once you enter, a large dim-lit hall with soft globe lights hanging from the ceiling, black&white checker board floors and beautiful Chinese-American themed mural awaits. I have not tried the food but people were mostly just drinking. The decor and ambience is on POINT but the drinks (except the Tame Impala) were pricey and unworthy. Plain glasses, no decorations of them. Not even a lime or an orange peel. Bourbon was too syrup-y sweet and the egg white foam on my Green Dragon was beyond raw-egg smelling. It smelled like a low-grade egg and definitely not fresh. Still, we proceeded on having our drink and the waitress immediately tells us we have to leave at 9:30 since there's no table service?? We were puzzled but complied and as we were paying, we asked our bills would be separate she just crumpled up the paper in front of us and gave us passive aggressive attitude. Very unprofessional. I had my fair share and probably would only return if someone else wants to try it for their first time. Cool establishment, but that's about it for me."}
{"text":"My friends were waiting inside the bar around 9:30pm for myself + another friend. The guy at the door did not let us in after I gave the name of my friend that had reserved a spot for our group. He then dismissed my friend and I very rudely. Was on a power trip. While we were waiting outside I was texting the crew to tell them the situation and asked how it was inside. They replied saying they weren't feeling it and would be glad to leave with us. They told us the vibe wasn't really friendly, service was poor and the drinks were mediocre. One of the drinks they received was not mixed properly. Don't waste your time going here. There's so many other interesting/unique bars + establishments that not only look good but have proper service and a welcoming atmosphere. You can find an aesthetically pleasing bars with good service and top notch tapas/drinks all over the city. We hit up the Dakota Tavern and Fifth Social after which ended up being so much better and had tons of good vibes."}
{"text":"Music was loud enough to get in the way of conversation, but not loud enough to feel like dancing. The entire group I was with felt the same way. Great craft beer selection. A little prettier than where I usually go. Was hoping for a little more laid back vibe, but it was overall fine. Would go back, but not in a rush."}
{"text":"I surprised my hubs with a visit here for some birthday drinks and we both loved it! First, it's fun to sneak behind the curtain and experience the surprising size of Mahjong's \"secret\" back bar. What awaits is a tropical, 80s inspired vibe with a dark ambiance. It was the perfect locale to top off our night and a fun concept to explore.   There was no line on a Monday night. The atmosphere was immediately inviting and unique, service was friendly and the drinks were amazing! I find it hard to believe others tasted the same drinks as me and did not enjoy the essence of the Tame Impala. It was gingery with a robust and lively flavour! I had the Tropical Thunder and it was awesome too, though different than I was expecting (in a good way!). The drinks were served without a garnish, which didn't really matter as the presentation was still great and the cocktails were perfectly balanced. We didn't try the food.   This place is new, so it's expected to see mixed reviews as there are below, but they certainly don't reflect the experience I had. I highly recommend this place, especially if you're looking to impress a date. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I can't comment on the food, but I can certainly comment on everything else! I was visiting from NYC and I came here two nights in a row (Friday and Saturday) because I loved it so much. I even stood in line during an ice storm the second night because I knew I would have a great time.   My boyfriend was drinking their delicious Japanese Highballs and I was drinking white wine. The crowd on that particular Friday was busier and more lively than Saturday and the music was more fun with a lot of hip hop and rap. Saturday was a bit more low key but still fun. Lots of people dancing and standing at the bar, but there was still plenty of room to sit down it didn't take long to order drinks. The bartenders were super cool and nice and the best part of my whole experience was how cool the crowd was... everyone was super friendly, happy to chat, happy to move over to create more room, and happy to let me squeeze in at the bar. Canadians are truly super nice people :) I will be back!"}
{"text":"As Christoph Waltz famously exclaimed in Inglorious Basterds: That's a bingo!  This place has it all: beautiful interior, amazing high-energy atmosphere, fantastic cocktails and drool-worthy Chinese food. AND it's got the coolness factor of being a \"secret\" bar hidden behind the curtain of a cute little convenience store.  We showed up around 9:30 on a Saturday and were told we'd have to wait about 45 minutes for a table, so we hit the bar. The place was jumping and the music (DJ in the corner) was on point. I ordered a perfectly balanced cocktail called Tropic Thunder, kind of like an elevated pina colada made with \"coconut-soaked rum\", pineapple, lime and the tropical pandan leaf. It was so good I ordered another.  Once seated, we opted for pork and shrimp wontons (served in sichuan chili oil, topped with scallions and sliced Thai chilis); spicy cucumber salad with crunchy sesame seeds; and Shanghai noodles with braised beef shank. All were dynamite!  As far as I'm concerned, this place is a winner. BINGO :)"}
{"text":"Nothing personal, but Mahjong Bar outlived its trendy appeal within the ten minutes that we were there. The hype, the long wait in line, the exposed brick and fusion menu are all staples of a bumping locale - but Mahjong Bar somehow managed to make all of this a hackneyed parody instead.   After waiting more than forty minutes in line, we were told we would need to grab a place at the bar. So we sidled up to a cramped bar and watched the uninspiring bartender languidly rattling shakers and reusing ice and strainers. The drinks, of course were equally average. My tame impala tasted more like it had been not only tamed, but castrated and saddled.   Overall, not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Concept is nice but poor execution, drinks are poorly balanced and definitely not worth the price. Not worth the hype."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Great vibes, great staff, and great food! We ate most of the menu and it was delicious! 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, bartenders are sweet, waitresses are polite and super accommodating. The venue is absolutely gorgeous. Would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"I don't usually write yelp reviews, but my experience at Mahjong bar was so awful I felt compelled to. For a $14 cocktail, I'd expect the bartender to use clean ice and a strainer. Instead, the bartender re-used ice from the last drink, and I received a mouthful of ice shards on my first sip.  The space and location have potential, but with gems like Black Hoof's cocktail bar and Han Moto in such close proximity, Mahjong bar will have to seriously up it's cocktail game for me to consider a second visit."}
