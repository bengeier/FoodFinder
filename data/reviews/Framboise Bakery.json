{"text":"Love at first bite! Loving all the small businesses popping up in inner city NW Calgary. I've found the Duchess to my Calgary."}
{"text":"So happy to have Framboise in the neighbourhood. The scones are the best I've had in Calgary and the croissants are delicious as well. The tasty pastries along with good coffee makes this place a perfect stop on my way to work. The selection isn't huge, but that's probably for the best since I want one of everything every time I stop in."}
{"text":"A new bakery with half a dozen tables for comfortable and somewhat stylish to-stay eating. In addition to bake goods, an assortment of candies like nougat & toffee are for sale along with a few specialty dry goods like Stoked Oats. I tried three of the dozen or so baked goods on offer, in increasing order of impressiveness: pain au chocolat, almond croissant and cheddar bacon scone. The pain was crispy on the outside, but quite soft on the inside. My holy grail is pain au chocolat that is flakey most of the way through (e.g. Le Fournil), so this was just an average effort. The almond croissant on the other hand had good flakiness most of the way through, made all the more impressive by the fact that the almond filling was integral to the pastry rather than being added in by slicing through after baking. The scone was perfection, large, buttery and light with a somewhat stratified large crumb and just the right amount of savory bits. I'll definitely be back for this!"}
{"text":"Tried the coffee passion fruit cake, was moist, not too sweet and delicious cream icing. Staff super friendly and cappuccino was pretty decent, will be back to try more. The lady who served me said weekend mornings or weekdays are the best time to come before everything sells out."}
{"text":"Update: Mission Pain au Chocolat is complete! I managed to get there in time today (they only had 2 left!!) and brought it home to enjoy with a cup of tea. Even confessed to the staff there that I'm a gluten-free person...with the exception of things that I believe are \"worth it\". 

Let me tell you - their Pain as Chocolat is epic. Outside, it is a perfect deep golden brown, where you still get the natural sweetness of the butter and a lovely flake. (That's where so many bakers go wrong. Baked just a hair too long and the taste becomes bitter.) 

The pastry inside is tender and stretchy, caressing just enough soft chocolate filling to satisfy a craving. Best thing is that the filling isn't too sweet, not too hard. 

I am still very impressed with the staff as well. The description of my next mission, the chocolate brioche, nearly had me walking out with two beautiful pastries today! The care they have in romancing the food is so great, plus they are always welcoming and cheerful!

Love, love, love Framboise. 






Bienvenue au voisinage, Framboise!

So lovely to have a little bakery and caf√© within a stone's throw of where I live. Their selection may not be super-elaborate, but the quality is there. Had the most beautiful Florentine - tender and just sweet enough, but not so much that you couldn't taste the butter in the base. Really delicious. 

The ginger cookies looked amazing, as did the croissants. Pain au chocolate is my favourite, so I will need to go earlier in the day to get one before they are all gone! 

I'd say that it's worth the trip down to the NW if you don't live nearby. I was very tempted by many other items, and I know I will be back...with friends...and a larger appetite...and my daughter...and my maman...sister..."}
{"text":"Very tasty pastries and sweets.  Addictive in many ways.
Friendly and knowledgable staff.

Coffee is hot!  You can ask for it to be cooled down or made less hot.  It is good coffee, but not a proper Italian or French coffee."}
{"text":"Service was awkward. Wish they had boxes for the tarts. It is a new business so I will be back, hope to update this for a better review. Yuzu tart was pretty good, pistachio croissant was okay too."}
{"text":"Between myself and my kids we shared a cinnamon bun, pain au chocolat, and a fruit tart- all tasty, delicate flavours and textures, not overwhelmingly sweet but still sweet.  More coffee options would be great, but as this is a bakery - I guess I should focus on the baked goods."}
{"text":"First heard of this bakery from CBC Calgary, they featured the story of the owner here who was a firmer lawyer. My wife and I came by and tried their coffee passion fruit cake and Americano... 

The timing that we came in was about one hr to close so it is understandable that selection was limited but the cake tasted good! Taste great with coffee! As it is close by a school it will be a great place for desserts and snacks!

We will come back again for sure!"}
{"text":"OH EM GEE.  The almond croissant is amazing!!!  I went on a Saturday morning and got two almond croissants for hubby and I, as well as an Americano for myself.  I loved the light and flaky and buttery almond croissant.  It was so good that I ate both on the way home and told hubby that I only ordered one and ate it in the car (shhh!!!).  It was so good that I went back the very next morning for another one but Framboise is closed on Sundays!  Boo...

The Americano was another story.  It was quite bland and tasted watered down.  And piping hot.  So hot I couldn't drink it until I got home 20 minutes later and even then I was taking tiny sips.  If it spilled on me on the ride home, I probably could've pulled a Cosmo Kramer.  It was THAT hot.  I took off one star for the not-so-great and way-too-hot Americano.  

I'll definitely be back to try other treats!"}
{"text":"Several of us moms watched and waited for this little place to open as it's very close to ours kids school so we've had our eye on it since the sign went up. Coffee + Moms = Happiness.

Been twice already. Both times my cappuccino was way to freaking hot. Can hardly hold the cup hot, with a sleeve on (not available the first time) and even watched a lady leave holding two saying ouch ouch ouch as she left lol. 

They seem to run out of pastries and baked goods shortly after lunch. Hopefully this is just growing pains, like the too hot coffee. Tried a cheese croissant on my second visit and it was doughy and uncooked in the middle. What was cooked was pretty tasty however. 

Looks like a nice selection of pastries and cakes (when they haven't run out) and a cute little place to have in this neighbourhood. Service was friendly but a bit scattered (again new business problems most likely).

Hopefully they have things figured out by September when school starts up again."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a Saturday afternoon. Very clean and bright as we walked in. Server was friendly and helpful. We ordered an almond croissant and a florentine. O-M-G.... that first bite was heaven in my mouth! The croissant was flaky buttery sweet and hitting that almond in the middle was enough to make me swoon!!!  I ate it slowly on purpose to savour every bite. Best croissant in Calgary hands down!!!  The florentine was also delicious with a buttery crust, caramel middle and sliced almonds on top. I highly recommend this place. Do not be fooled by the store front or location. Truly a hidden gem! I will return to try the lemon tart and the chocolate items next!!!"}
