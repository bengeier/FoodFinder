{"text":"Good service, average food. Too much butter used .. We ordered stuffed chicken and pasta."}
{"text":"Very nice Italian restaurant ..exceptional service , good music :) we 'll be back for sure"}
{"text":"We where in the neighbourhood looking for pizza and something on the lighter side, so we figured Italian. The wood fired pizza was excellent. I love thin  crust pizza. Was one of the better pizzas I had in a while. This place is nice and quiet with an authentic Italian restaurant vibe. We only tried the pizza. For me it was great and what I was looking for."}
{"text":"As a frequent visitor to Toronto, I can say that I've tried many restaurants here and even if the food at an establishment was mediocre, I was treated with courtesy and respect by the staff.   Verdi is an exception to the above statement.  On this occassion I had broughr my elderly parents with me. We were seated by the waiter and then he disappeared for 10 minutes before bringing us our menus (it was 5:30pm on a Wednesday..there was nobody in the restaurant other than us..). He dropped 3 menus on the table and, without even smiling,  asked us for our drink order. It took another 10 minutes to get our drinks and, when he came to our table with them I indicated we were ready to order (my parents are diabetic and need to eat at a specific time hence we made sure we got to the restaurant early enough) to which his response was \"I will be back to take your order\" and he did return...after 5 minutes.  We asked our waiter for some bread and he never brought it. It took 30 minutes for our food to arrive and when it did, it came all at once (we'd ordered 2 appetizers) and I had to ask him to bring cheese for our pastas (another wait of several minutes).   The food was disappointing:  the pasta was not fresh but the packaged variety, a bit overcooked and the sauce was bland. My parents had entrees (one meat and the other fish): the meat was fatty and undercooked (it was ordered well done for health reasons: we had to send it back as it could not be eaten) and the fish was dry and flavorless.   The restaurant itself is not clean...you can see dust build up, dry food splashes on walls and the washrooms are just plain nasty.  I was very disappointed and upset that I'd wanted to treat my parents to a nice meal but instead received poor food and atrocious service. I will never again visit this restaurant."}
{"text":"Very good Italian food. Penne arribiata is amazing. So are all of the pizzas.   The service is not the greatest, and the food is pricey. But, if you can overlook the minor shortcomings, the food is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Verdi was an enjoyable experience.  I had the pasta with the rosé sauce (forget the exact name of the dish) and split the bruschetta with my friend's mom.   The pasta was homey and the bruschetta was simple but good.    Both the appetizer and the mains were sizable and you can could tell that the ingredients were fresh."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time. The food is tasteless and so are the staff. The manager is so rude I can't even believe this place is still in business. Walking by on a weekend you will notice that there is no one inside.......there is good reason for this. Stay away!!!"}
{"text":"Nice restaurant, with courteous service.   Nice European  Atmosphere like old Montreal restaurants. Decoration is nice and authentic Italian cuisine is tasty.  I taste the Verdi pizza and wasn't disapointed. Wooden oven pizza with chicken mozzarella and spinach, pesto and a touch of goat cheese it was one of the best pizza I taste.  My girlfriend had fettuccine Verdi and she like it mucho !   I recommend this restaurant to anybody in Toronto who has a taste for  Italian food at affordable prices.  Bon petit resto avec service courtois à prix plus que raisonnable.  Belle décoration donnant une ambiance européenne tout comme les restaurants du vieux Montreal.  J'ai dégusté la pizza Verdi et j'ai bien apprécié ! Cuite au four comportant poulet, pesto, épinard et une touche de fromage de chèvre.   C'est tout simplement une des meilleure pizza que j'ai mangé!  Ma blonde a bien apprécié son fettutinne Verdi !  Je recommande ce petit restaurant sympathique pour l'authentique cuisine italienne à prix raisonnable dans la région de Toronto."}
{"text":"Food is amazing, atmosphere good, servers are good but the boss is an unpleasant man and ruins everything. Not worth wasting your money here."}
{"text":"I definitely had a very different experience than the previous reviewer. I walked in Verdi based off a recommendation from an Italian friend, the outside does very little to convince you to try. Inside, I had a lovely meal with grilled calamari, penne alla vodka, ceasar salad, and quail. Here is my breakdown:  - best grilled calamari I've had in the city, a little spicy which was great  - definitely the best penne alla vodka I've had, incredibly creamy and rich - ceasar was nothing special - quail was de-boned battered and lightly fried, quite nice but heavy  So that was my experience, give the place a try if you're already in the area."}
{"text":"I've been to this place only once about a year ago, don't go. My 14 year old brother can cook better pasta than these folks. It was priced like a good restaurant in the area, totally not worth the money."}
{"text":"This is my best friend and my go-to place for Italian food. Because it is often empty when we go (usually around 5pm), we get the time to catch up and talk.  Service is attentive and fast (could be due to the fact that the dinner rush has not started yet). The servers are courteous - they still pour water even after dinner and we're just talking.  I've ordered the mushroom risotto and the gnocchi. The risotto is cooked to perfection and is not too salty or bland. The gnocchi are perfect little pillows lying on a bed of cream sauce. This place is Italian at its best :)"}
{"text":"Strolling around the neighbourhood friday night, took a chance on Verdi. Their specials looked on point, the place was not packed but not empty, and well I love good italian food.   I will try to keep this short and explain why i gave it only 3 stars, first off, the food was good, for the most part. Bread was fresh, the olive oil with herbs was nice. Appetizer mussels in white wine/butter sauce were great. My main, pasta alla vodka was fine, my friends seared tuna (which was special of the night) was horribe. Service was rushed (which i couldnt understand), our waiter would ltierally dash away from our table after answering a question or serving a drink, prompting me to ask him to come back to ask a question or god forbid take another order down. In summation,  Service - Did kinda suck Food- It was good, but mussels arent hard to make and so its expected they be good, pasta alla vodka is easy too, theirs was delish but overly creamy.  Food2- If you mess up the special, well you lose me.   To say the least, it could have been alot better, and because of the lack of service and lack of detail in the food, i wont be returning!"}
{"text":"The food here is definitely above average. It is a bit noisier than most restaurants, but I don't mind. The service is good and the ambience is good. I've had the pasta and some of the meat dishes and I would say it is above average for the area. I haven't gotten a chance to try the pizza, but the next time I go I will definitely give it a try.   The one thing that would put this restaurant over the top for me is if the desserts were better. That's the only thing I would change about this place"}
