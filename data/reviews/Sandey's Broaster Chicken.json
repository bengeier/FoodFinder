{"text":"I was confused when i went back to this place because it used to be under the management of Chef Karlos, while it was on his management I enjoyed the food it was great and the BBQ was super delicious!  But now, it is under new management AGAIN! and food is not as good as it used to! Chef K come back!"}
{"text":"One star for fear, two star for hope. Tried to call and see the status so i may be able to go out tonight.  Got a automated voice asking me to enter the Buisinesses                                                                                             number over and over  \  But without hope... whats the point? I do so hope it was a glitch, and that it returned, Yes, the location was poor. and perhaps that's the problem, but the solution in sound,k and good food for a reasonable $$ for what you get. I bet if they delivered they would have broken even, if that was the problem.

{"text":"My friends and I went to Sandey's Broaster Chicken on 1155 S Higley in Mesa, AZ. As loyal customers we are highly disappointed in the change. They have added an Indian Buffet to the restaurant. The macaroni and cheese was not cheesy but tasted like flour and was soupy. The cole slaw had an after taste to it like it had not been properly covered in the refrigerator at night and absorbed the odor of other foods. After leaving the restaurant the smell of the Indian curry lingered in our nostrils and attached to our clothing. Unfortunately, we will now have to find a new Broaster Chicken restaurant. We will not be going back."}
