{"text":"Why is 'Chicken 65' called chicken 65? @baigsgrill    Delicious chicken with spicy spice! the NAAN however was a bit different - it was definitely fresh but it had the smell of Yeast in it still which I thought was odd.  HOWEVER - I was informed that they fresh baker's yeast thus the difference and mad freshness"}
{"text":"The newest joint in town adding spice and flavor to the winter.  Located in Brampton, this place prides itself in serving authentic Hyderabadi cuisine along with a host of other dishes. Happened to drop in for lunch. Was lucky to have been greeted and welcomed by the chef. The ambience is comfortable, warm and welcoming.  Ordered the \"Lukhmi\" - deep fried pockets of dough filled with tender smoke flavored mince meat. Perfect appetizer.  Then came the platter, a combination of perfectly grilled meats . The sheekh kabab takes special mention here. Tender and juicy with the outside having a smoke infused flavor from the grill.  This place claims to serve the most authentic Hyderabadi biryani. Theres no arguing that the Biryani is hands down the real thing. Aromatic rice cooked with tender meat . The quality of the ingredients speak for themselves.  The double ka meetha is irresistible. 5 stars it has to be - for all the effort in keeping recipes true, and taste authentic."}
{"text":"This is a place I've tried couple of times and can't stop falling in love with this place. Had Biryani here and its really good the chicken 65  is the best here.   A tray of chicken Biryani cost us only 25$ and it was worth the price. Great place to take your family"}
{"text":"Went again with the family and got to try their lamb biryani. It was delicious, as expected! Rest of the food at par as well. Will be back again for sure   (This time the restaurant was jam packed. We had to wait a very long time for our order. Turned out there was a mix up of orders...the owner was very apologetic and gave us a pretty decent discount. Goes to show that they really want to succeed at this. Wish them all the best!)"}
{"text":"Superb Hyderabadi Biryani! Will definitely return. ... And very good size servings. Decent ambience. Family friendly."}
