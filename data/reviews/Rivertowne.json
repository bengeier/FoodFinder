{"text":"We should have taken the hint when at 9pm on a Saturday the place was empty. Our appetizer of scotch eggs was completely burnt to the point it was hard to cut. My entree was the steak which was such a poor cut of meat that it was inedible. I asked for a side of spinach and was given a dish of chopped frozen spinach. When we got the bill, we were changed for a beer the waitress never brought and that I went to the bar and got myself. It's obvious there are management and quality issues at this location and there is a reason why they are slow. It's such a great location and decor so it's a shame."}
{"text":"Horrible service and overpriced drinks as well as crappy food!! Won't be coming here again! Beware they'd rather put crap on their tvs than the pittsburgh pirates game even after we requested to watch baseball game! Don't waste your time go to Jerome Bettis!"}
{"text":"Best blackened gorgonzola burger ever great service nice fun atmosphere can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Great draft list and the food is very good as well.  Sometimes the staff can be very bad but our last visit there they were great.  Can't beat Southern Tier Pumking on tap for $7.50 for a big glass."}
{"text":"We had a great server with really good food overall except the seared tuna. It was really flavorless. That being said....everything else was really good. My daughter ordered the salmon off the kids menu and it was out of this world! My mom had the coconut shrimp that was dynamite,and i had the portabella mushroom skillet that was really good as well. Service was good"}
{"text":"Before a concert at Stage AE last night, the hubby and I stopped in to grab a bite because we had tried their beer and the food sounded good. For this review, service gets a D and food gets an A+  We walked in and the hostess was incredibly rude. She mumbled something (in a loud bar area during a Pirates game, it's difficult to hear) about table or bar and when my husband asked what she said, she mumbled the same thing and I said we'd like a table. She turned around and started walking away. So we stood there until she turned back around and looked at us with a face that says \"Why are you not following me?\" So we followed her to our table where she threw our menus down and started to walk away. I said thank you and she didn't even look at me. When we sat down, I noticed some water left on the table and was wondering if I should go to the bar to get a towel. The hostess came back and wiped it down without me asking and when I said thank you again, she just walked away. If you have ever been to a Dick's Last Resort restaurant where they make the paper hats and are total jerks to the customers as part of the ambiance, this hostess should quit and move to one of those restaurants immediately. She would do much better in a restaurant like that.  Next, our waitress came to our table and took our drink order. She brought them back to us and was pleasant enough but definitely not as enjoyable as the lady who brought our food who had a smile on her face the entire time she was at our table. I wish she could rub off on the hostess...  Now for the food: AMAZING. We decided to share two entrees so that we could try different items. We split the seafood mac and cheese and a small coconut shrimp bucket. The seafood mac and cheese was creamy and delicious and full of shrimp and scallops. The scallops were tender and paired perfectly with the red peppers that are in the dish as well. The coconut shrimp bucket was absolutely incredible. A small bucket (you have the option of small or large) comes with five HUGE shrimp battered with coconut flakes and served with a large amount of french fries. The sweet chili sauce that the dish comes with is the perfect amount of spicy to pair with the sweetness of the coconut.   We also enjoyed different beers, all brewed by Rivertowne, that were very good. I had \"Always a Home Game\" and \"Grateful White\", the hubby had \"Babbling Blonde\" and \"Hala Kahiki\". Very good beer.  So, overall, the service experience is definitely lacking (mostly because of the hostess working that night) but the food is incredible and will make up for any bad experience with service. I will be back again and again on nights I don't have anywhere to be when I can just sit outside with my beer and my food, enjoying the beautiful sites of Pittsburgh from the river's edge."}
{"text":"Slowest service ever.  Waited an hour for my seat for a party of 5, was told it would take 20 minutes.  Saw multiple employees take multiple cigarette breaks during this timeframe,  including who I found later to be the manager.   When I asked how much longer, we were told theu weren't sure, that they had a lot of dirty tables.  Never ate,  Never got a drink, never coming back."}
{"text":"Cold kids pasta, A/C too high, prices too high, chicken nachos come with pieces of chicken large as chicken fingers and fruit with the kids meals - was all at least 2 days old.  Service was very slow as it took 25 minutes just to get a pile of chips, 2 kids orders of pasta and a PB&J. I would never recommend this place not return again."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Our server, Katy, was really friendly and knew the menu well. I needed help deciding how my tuna should be cooked and what dressing to use on my salad and she gave me some recommendations. My meal was absolutely perfect! Also, the atmosphere was great--there was some awesome music playing when we first arrived, but they turned the TV sound on when the dinner crowd came in. We had a great time!"}
{"text":"Jalapeño bites are amazing.... Been coming for years... Never been let down!! Good neighborhood bar... Good food... Decent prices... Occasionally old ladies hitting on dudes twenty years younger than them and looking a mess... But entertaining. Good Friday night pick"}
{"text":"I have been to this location twice, and their Monroeville location several times, and I just keep being slightly disappointed.  The beer selection is awesome, and it's a great place to drink.  However, the food is never that great and I keep wanting to come here only for the beer.  On this visit, I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap, and there was hardly any flavor in it save for the chunks of iceberg lettuce, which isn't saying much.  The fries are tasty, if a bit limp, but I will not order the wrap again.   Also on this occasion I tried to use the LoyalTree app for the first time.  However, there was no code on the table and when we asked the waitress for the code, she brought one that was only good for late nights.  Since she hardly came back to the table often, we decided to give up on the points for this visit. Not a way to ensure people are rewarded for visiting.  Great location for tourists or people who work on the north side (I do), and awesome for drinking with friends, but eat somewhere else if you want memorable food."}
{"text":"Beware - they don't honor the deals on their website.  We are in town and looked up places to go.  Rivertowne advertises a happy hour on their website Monday through Friday 4-6 so we came.  I ordered a drink expecting the happy hour price but after it was poured they finally then told us that since there would be a game that day (three hours later, mind you) that happy hour is canceled.  I'm not here for the game and I'm really annoyed I came here when I could have gone somewhere else."}
{"text":"Hit or miss. The first time I went the food was AMAZING so much so I I went back for a second time in a week. The first time I got a 'build your own pizza' with Alfredo sauce and chicken. The second time I ordered the same thing and they forgot the Alfredo but put it on the side, okay fine it was still good. Today, I ordered food to pick up and ordered the same pizza for a third time. I was told they didn't have Alfredo sauce for pizza only white garlic or red sauce (even after having it twice!)  I asked if they could put the Alfredo on the side like the did before, the woman taking my order said they could ( I don't understand why it can be put on the side and not the pizza.) I picked up the food and brought it home and the \"Alfredo\" was literally warm milk with salt at the bottom LITERALLY! Needless to say, I'm beyond angry. The quality has gone down consistently since my first visit, I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Back in June, I ate at your restaurant with my wife and some friends, where we didn't have the best dining experience.   Well, my wife and I were craving some dessert and hot beverages, so we decided to return on a few months later (November) and we are happy to say that our second experience was completely the opposite of the first one.   We were greeted by Jenna C., who was pleasant from the word go. She stopped by while my wife was away from our table, and when I asked her if she would be able to return in a few minutes, it was no problem. And when she did, she was attentive, listening to my wife's account of the night of our previous visit. She was the perfect server for us that night - and hopefully, we have her again in the future.   As for our order - well, as I said earlier, we were simply there for dessert and hot beverages, which hit the spot perfectly. My wife, who is a big-time coffee drinker, really enjoyed her Irish coffee and I enjoyed my hot chocolate. As for the dessert - she was also very happy with that.   To sum it up, everything that went right at the Rivertowne the second night redeemed all that didn't go right the first time. We're already anticipating our third time being just as good"}
{"text":"We have given this place a chance over and over again.  In the past we had issues with the servers not knowing what specials were or what day the specials occurred on.  Tonight we went here for happy hour - come to find out they changed their policy during pirate home games. Even though their website still listed the special.   Rivertowne beer is excellent but staff don't seem to care much at this location.  And please stop taking the receipt which includes the loyaltree reward info. Tonight we got a bill without actually seeing what was on the bill.   Location is excellent and this place could be even better with a little bit of ambition."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my \"go to\" places on the north shore. Had a less then stellar experience a few months back, but decided to give it another try.  Service was wonderful, but the food was mediocre. The seafood Mac and cheese was more like a cheese soup with small pieces of previously frozen seafood and rotini.  I'm fully aware that that isn't a gourmet restaurant by any means, but a $16 price tag is not in line with the poor quality. The wings were overcooked, which is a huge disappointment compared with how they used to be.  Pizza was decent, beers were good, but a second bad experience = beers only in the future."}
{"text":"Drink specials are great, however if they paid a bit more attention to the \"during the game\" crowd and not the \"pregame\" crowd entirely it may be workable, the bathrooms are disgusting, there is so much dust in the bathroom it is even on the WALLS! Not even sure how that happens, the pretzel was a combo of pretzel/funnel cake/donut over fried, over cooked, couldn't even entertain ordering any sort of food based on first impressions. All that's said service was good and bloodies were decent"}
{"text":"We first tried Rivertowne beer at the Taste of Two Towns at the Oakmont library. It was enough to make us try the restaurant.   Very cool neighborhood joint. Nonsmoking dives are great.   Late 20 -mid 30's yuppies intermix with native yinzers. Alcohol prices are spot on - several cider (gluten free) options. Rivertowne deals are the best (obviously). Happy hour is spot on, with discount apps and beers.   Food is stellar pub grub. Coconut shrimp and artichoke dip is our favorite. We asked for tortilla chips instead of pita for the dip - just a smile and no upcharge.   Lots of TV's, but they're not invasive. I typically hate sitting at the bar, but this one is comfy and expansive.   My only gripe is it's not nearly as clean as it could be. Carnivores is much cleaner - but the food is better here. Also, there's no heater above the entrance, so sitting in the first seating area is an exercise in futility for 6 months out of the year."}
{"text":"I have been to all the Rivertowne's a number of times. There will be an occasional  miss with food prep if they are dealing with a newbie, but on the whole they do a great job. Notables are their large full wings, but also their dishes with ahi tuna are excellent. Very good tap selection."}
{"text":"Our favorite close to home spot! Foods always good, wing night in Wednesday's is our favorite! But the pizza is delicious as well!"}
{"text":"Drink selection was meh (both beer and liquor). Bathroom smelled like the Zoo (don't get me wrong the Pittsburgh Zoo is great, but not this!). Service, seemed to be sub-par. The bar was fairly empty except for my group of colleagues (about 7 of us) and a couple of other guys at the other end   The waitresses were busy eating and kissing the other patrons which was a little bizarre, and they clearly weren't focusing where they should have been (or where the money was (and went))."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times before concerts at Stage AE.  It's a nice little seafood place...but definitely more bar food style than anything.  They have a few lighter options, but I have a weak spot for fried fish...and they have plenty of options if that's what you're in the mood for.  I went last night and had one if the pub pretzels with their beer cheese as an appetizer, which was amazing (seriously, you must try one if you go).  For my meal, I had the coconut shrimp...also amazing.  I was really impressed that they used tiger prawns (I verified this with our server as they were so massive, I had first thought they were gulf shrimp).  I also loved the sweet dipping sauce.  My friend also said her meal (citrus glazed mahi mahi) was delicious.  The service was great, as well.  I would definitely go back when I'm in the area for another concert (it's also right next to PNC Park)."}
{"text":"I NEVER leave reviews as I am a service worker as well. I actually work a few doors down from Rivertowne.   To start, I used to eat here religiously - maybe 2-3 days a week. I was totally in love with their Shrimp & Grits as well as their Black and Bleu Burger. Loved them. The Buffalo Tots were amazing, too. I loved everything on the menu, I would recommend this place to my friends, I even went on my 21st birthday to eat here.   Welllllll a few months ago they did a complete revamp of their menu. Needless to say, they totally messed up. Took off almost every single menu item. I understand downsizing a menu to make a kitchen more manageable, but they didn't even keep some of the recipes the same. I mean, completely changed EVERY. THING.   Normally I'm not a brat about this kind of stuff, *especially* if the changes were for the better. Unfortunately, the new food is actually gross. Some of it inedible. I ordered takeout a few times since the menu change. Figured I'd give it a few tries. The Buffalo Tots stayed the same which I was super excited about. The Seafood PoBoy was also fantastic. But when I tell you literally every other item I ordered I threw away, I am not joking. Straight in the garbage. And I am NOT a picky person. Even if my order is messed up I NEVER complain. But this stuff was absolutely disgusting. I ordered the Fish and Chips not even 3 hours ago in a takeout.  The chips were completely stale and just foul. The fish was badly burnt, but I still ate it because I don't like to complain. No joke - I've been puking for the last three hours. Completely sick off this stuff. My stomach is on angles after eating their food. I also ordered a soft pretzel and (I'm not sure if they are supposed to give sauce or not) but it came with no sauce and was also burnt. Again I don't complain so I just ate it with some ranch I found in my fridge and it was completely inedible. Straight into the garbage it went.   Still working out my sick stomach after eating this food. I'm sorry Rivertowne, I used to love you so very much!!!! But this new menu is absolutely disgusting. I'll be back for some beer but never again will I eat this food!!! (That's why I gave 2 stars because I still love your beer!!!)"}
{"text":"We were already down on the North Shore and it was 90 minutes before the Pirates game, so we decided to grab some dinner. As on our previous visit, we were told 30-35 minutes wait but just 15 minutes later we received the text that our table was ready.   The server got our drink order promptly after we were seated but it took about 10 minutes for her to bring them. She ordered a lettuce chicken wrap, I opted for fish and chips, substituting cole slaw for the fries.  She said her wrap was quite unimpressive, and my fish - although a nice size serving, was just lousy. Soggy throughout as if it had been soaking in water. The coating was soggy, the inside was soggy, and it had very little taste. It was bad, and I'm not that picky. Cole slaw was not bad, but a very small portion.  Beer menu was extensive but overly weighted to high alcohol content beers.   Service was fine, ambiance was loud, menus were sticky and stained (man, I hate that).  This was our second visit and I think next time we'll try someplace else on the North Shore."}
{"text":"Walked out after just less than 10 minutes after sitting at the bar and no server acknowledged that we were even there.  Three different servers walked past and never even looked at us let alone mention they would be there in a moment."}
{"text":"I feel like in the last year - I have had drinks and eats here more then anywhere else in the city.  I really want to give this place 5 stars but there are definitely some areas that need improvement.    What doesn't need improvement - at least in my opinion - is the food and drink.  The food is bar food but it is well-priced and there is a good amount of diversity on the menu.  I typically order the baked italian sub, the buffalo chicken wrap, and the turkey bacon wedgie (that's right wedgie). The Pizzas also look great but I have never had one.  The draft list is always diverse and I have tried some great new brews here.  This is a great place to watch any type of sporting event and they have a pretty decent happy hour as well - although sometimes you have to remind the servers what the specials are.    This brings me to what prevents me from giving this place 5 stars - the service and the atmosphere.  First the service - I have had great experiences with the service and also experiences that are sub-par.  First - the waitresses are usually very nice but they neglect to write things down and food will come out incorrectly.  I am not one to send things back but this has happened more than once.  Also they are always willing to split up checks - which is very much appreciated but they seldom split them up correctly (because they don't write anything down).  The ladies at the host stand are sometimes miserable but almost always don't know what you are talking about when you let them know that you already checked-in with NoWait.  Finally, Rivertowne brings in the most annoying DJ  that plays awful music on Pirates Game Days.  This is completely not necessary - especially since there is a digital jukebox here.  Rather then be something that its not with the DJ - I just wish Rivertowne would play on its strengths and be a cool and funky sports bar with good food and drinks.  Despite its shortcomings - unless something better opens up in the Northside I will likely keep coming back."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how I've never been here until yesterday! Staff was wonderful and the burgers are AMAZING. Top 5 I've had in Pittsburgh. Fries are fresh cut. Yum! Wings were ok. Wouldn't order again but there was so much more on the menu that I cannot wait to try!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed their selection if beers. I had their pineapple beer and the Belgium wit. Both were very good. The sandwiches that my party and I ordered were all done well. I got the Pacino and it was excellent. We sat outside on the patio and our waitress checked on us many times."}
{"text":"This is a very nice Rivertowne location. Compared to the other ones, this one has so much room, and even a separate dining room from the bar area. The location is great, right on the north shore near all of the events down there. Service was pretty good, we were well taken care of. The Rivertowne beer selections are vast, but happy hours are not unfortunately. I'd definitely come back!"}
{"text":"We are a fan of the other Rivertowne locations, so when we couldn't get into Bettis Grille (for the third time--a 45-minute wait at 11:10 a.m.) we were happy to find that they could take us immediately.  I ordered the Crabby Patty, not expecting much more than a pre-formed crab cake.  Was I surprised!  It was the best crab cake sandwich I ever had, definitely freshly made and all crab.  I also ordered the fruit salad and, again, it was freshly made with ripe fruit, not something out of a can.  Well worth the price paid.  Service isn't always quick, they are always busy on game days, but it is attentive, friendly and accurate.  A plus for the North Side."}
{"text":"Just left this place.. and all I can say is... wow.. what happened to yins? They use to have the best food around... first the menu .. choices was horrible.. second the nachos... I paid 15 bucks for small plate of nachos with 4 pieces of chicken and some random white sauce that was in it.. and third... everything we all got from wings to hoagie was disgusting.. I spent 54 bucks on garbage. So disappointed. Never will I come back to this place. And it's ashame because they were the best around."}
{"text":"Like the previous reviewer stated this place is a total dive but the food is great! The place isn't the cleanest, the seats on the booths are cracking and the bathroom isn't the cleanest or most private either. There is a toilet and two urinals in the men's room but no walls. The urinals are right by the door so I suggest locking it before you pee or anyone who walks in will see your entire manhood.   Service was fairly good. The drinks are great as well. We had the bacon cheddar ranch fries and Piranha Pizza. It has pepperoni, sausage, bacon, ham, salami, and cappicola. It's just as good as any pizza at Mineo's.   They also have a ton of different beers, burgers, salads, soups, seafood, wings, wraps, subs, sandwiches, pasta, steaks and much much more.   If you can get past their lack of cleanliness you will really like this place! Check out their website: http://www.myrivertowne.com"}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite bars. They have delicious beer on tap. The Scottish ale is amazing. The cheese sticks and spinach and artichoke dip are my favorite menu items. It's dark and a little divey, but it's a good place to hang out."}
{"text":"Good food, large portions, they brew there own beers with good choices. Will be here again."}
{"text":"Our Meetup group stopped for a late lunch after visiting the Omnimax at the Carnegie Science Center.  It wasn't a busy time so we were seated quickly and the server was very accommodating since there was 9 of us and of course separate checks yada, yada, yada. She kept checking on us to make sure that everything was ok and was always pleasant.    Everyone ordered different selections and they were all very pleased that we came there and raving about their choices, pizzas, salads, sandwiches.  I am on a quest for the best fish in the burgh and that was my choice.  It was good, needed to cooked a little longer since it was still a little grey but still good. It was a thick cut of Cod not skinny, good batter not cornmeal. The fries were right up there as well, fresh cut! Yes. They have a nice variety on their menu, something for everyone.   For myself being the organizer of the group I was happy that they were pleased with my choice for dining and felt it was a great get together going a place they would of never been other wise. So I know they will all be back when they are in the area.  Oh yea, Great view of the city!"}
{"text":"First off, i think it is very telling when a brewery offers another brewery or mass market producers beer......  Today, I attended a holiday lunch with a few of my coworkers at river town. I personally didn't have any food but they told me the fries were very crisp and delicious. I did have two beers during my Visit, but they were not brewed by river town.  The atmosphere was ok. The music up way too loud and I could barely hear the person sitting next to me."}
{"text":"nice a lot of tvs to watch hockey game. Service dog friendly. They asked if we needed a water bowl for my service dog. Thank you but against the rules."}
{"text":"For a few years my friends and I would stop at Rivertowne prior to events at PNC or Heinz Field.  The food was average at best but the beer was excellent.  It would get busy before events.    Happy hour was a nice bonus, 4-6 1/2 price beers.  I visited in early June and asked our waitress if I could have one more beer before happy hour was over.  She told me they don't do that anymore.  I glanced at their website and the specials were still on there.  I showed her my phone and she said she would talk to the manager.  Whether she did or not, I am unsure.  She told me there was nothing they could do so I asked to see the manager.  The manager was friendly, explained the change (discounts are now only on non-event days).  I showed her my phone, and she honored the special.  So between the average to slightly below average food, and other pre-game options available I will not be going back to the Rivertowne.  Don't bother emailing the restaurant either because they will not reply."}
{"text":"We stopped at Rivertowne after our Heinz Field tour and before our walk over to the Aviary and Warhol. Definitely a good spot to grab a beer at lunch (hey, it was vacation!) The food wasn't the most memorable, but that makes it A-Ok in my book. Nothing to rave about, but nothing to rant about either. Right down the middle.   The beer I tried was tasty as well, Scottish Ale and Old Wylie's IPA. I preferred the IPA though I generally prefer the Scottish Ales. Weird. Anyway, if you're in the area have a beer! I bet it's super fun on game days!"}
{"text":"Worst experience eating here. Restaurant is clean and menu food appears to be good. However we never saw our waiter. He also appeared to be high or hungover from the night before. Our calamari was incinerated, my sons simple sandwich was made wrong twice, and our food sat under heat lamps waaaaay too long! See photo!  So mad our nice family lunch was so terrible!!"}
{"text":"Went here with a group of girlfriends celebrating a bachelorette party, before a Pirates game. Even though they were very busy, they were able to get us a table for six people fairly quickly (about 30 mins).   I really enjoyed the homemade beer. The pineapple really tasted like pineapple, and not too sweet either. The food was OK. I had the tuna steak and my friend had a club sandwich, neither came with any condiments such as mayonnaise. They were a little dry.   The service was excellent and we were able to finish up and head to the game before it started. The best part was probably the view. There is an outdoor seating area right along the river."}
{"text":"Went to Riverton b 4 Xmas party for a drink and an app but we sat had to find someone to get us menu took our drink order and disappeared never saw here again because she sat at the bar talking to the person behind the bar. had to find someone else to pay our bill weren't able to get any food."}
{"text":"I am not from Pittsburgh but travel there often for sporting events and concerts, and I have always had a great experience at Rivertowne despite it being usually crowded. ( The bar is right across from Heinz Field, PNC Park, and Stage AE) I have to say three things, largely in response to other reviews I have read...  One, this is a sports bar. If you are ordering appetizers, pizza, wings, etc. I dont think you can go wrong. I cannot attest to how the tuna is, because this is a sports' bar. I wouldn't order it here, nor would I go to a Mexican restaurant and order a cheeseburger. The buffalo chicken dip is as good as buf chic dip can be.  Two, the beer is cold and the drinks are strong! Again, this is not a gastro-pub.  Three, if you go here prior to or after a game, have a little patience. I have seen the staff run their tails off, slinging food and drink to get the patrons to the game on time.   If you are looking for a fun atmosphere, some quick bites, accompanied by some adult beverages, Rivertowne is great!"}
{"text":"The new dj is hot! And he was playing all kinds of jams! Bartenders are great too! Beer list is always on point and the food is great! Love the fire pit! That is an added bonus!"}
{"text":"This is a great spot for watching a game on one of plentiful TV's. Predominantly young & loud patrons on the Saturday night we were there. Not that there's anything wrong with that, mind you. Several 20-somethings were dancing near the bar and were clearly traaaaashed but the bartenders kept serving them. Kind of a South Side vibe in that respect.  Food sampled included nachos (aka big heaping pile of multi-colored chips w/ very little cheese or other fixins under the top layer), asian shrimp wrap w/ few shrimp, and a cheeseburger w/ cole slaw on the side that wasn't bad but not great either.  Ordered the Rivertowne Pumpkin Ale w cinnamon dusting on the rim and it was really a great tasting beer!! Super delish!!  Our waiter was attentive and super nice but kept forgetting things like waters we ordered three times and small plates for nachos.   Bathroom was mostly clean & well stocked.  Nothing amiss there.  Probably would go back but only for a drink. Good proximity to Heinz Field & PNC Park."}
{"text":"Only stopped in for a few drinks . I didn't eat anything . The place was very clean but I felt the bar area was small . The place will packed during sporting events so I am not sure how that is going to work . The patio area was still closed because the furniture has not arrived yet . Worth checking out ."}
{"text":"The appetizer of jalapeño poppers was tasty. The cheese was in abundance and the pepper was mild to suit the cheese perfectly. The burger was perfectly cooked to well medium well. My friends coconut shrimp was also five star along with then lemon pepper fries. Can't wait to come here again with my girlfriend."}
{"text":"HAPPY HOUR...!    This review is written solely to let everyone know that Rivertown's North Shore happy hour, from 4 till 6, Mpnday thru Friday, with Half Off all drinks- meaning domestic drafts can be had for 2 singles, and they have $3 snacks of cheeseburger sliders, bacon cheddar ranch fries, tortilla chips & dips, pub pretzel bites & scotch eggs...    Folks- if you are down on the North Shore and all the other bars are dead- this one will be packed.  They have a modest sized bar and if the weather co-operates- you can pull up stools to their outdoor bar windows and get served from outside."}
{"text":"We live within walking distance of Rivertowne and finally made it down to their North Shore location last night. I generally like their beer and their other pub was great, but man, everything we were served last night was terrible! All the beer tasted skunky, like they hadn't cleaned their lines in awhile. My turkey Rachel was terrible and cold - it's supposed to be a hot sandwich, but the cheese wasn't even melted and the bread was dry and not cooked at all. We'll never eat there again. If you're in the area, do yourself a favor and avoid this place. There are lots of other options."}
{"text":"This place is really good. On the North Shore & North Huntingdon....both are great! The wings are very good, as is everything else there. They got their own microbrew beers, which is a nice plus.  50 cent boneless wings on Wednesday.  The atmosphere is great, especially on the North Shore, right between PNC Park & Heinz Field.  Go Steelers, Go Pens, Go Pirates!"}
{"text":"While I won't say Rivertowne is \"great\", I'm writing this review with the other stadium stand-by's in mind.  With one of the better beer selections available (including beer from their commercial brewery in Export), Rivertowne also has some decent sandwiches and actually a couple pretty solid pizzas.  The atmosphere is bearable before/during/after games (which is a rarity in that area), and like a lot of the other restaurants, it's got some outside seating with access to watch games and enjoy some sun.  I'll continue to stray here versus other options on a consistent basis, and I still want to go for one of their happy hours (discounted bar food and 1/2 priced drafts!)."}
{"text":"Nikia G was slow as heck and rude!  Took forever to get drinks, and when she brought them out, it was with attitude.  Food was good.  However, with it being almost empty when we went, there should have been better service.  Maybe even a \"thank you for coming\" instead of just throwing the check down for me to pay."}
{"text":"I can't say if the food is good here or not but I can tell you that the service is awful.  After being seated, we waited 30 minutes in a restaurant that was not busy and we were not even acknowledged by the multiple servers that walked past our table.  We left and ate Grille 36 where we had a great meal and attentive servers."}
{"text":"Biked to Rivertowne with a friend for a beer and some appetizers. It was a nice day and the Buccos were playing. Overall the service was average, but the pub pretzels were great (fyi, they are fried). We also had the fried zucchini which were good. Good atmosphere, decent food, check it out when you can."}
{"text":"The Mecca of buffalo chicken dips is right here!!! You will not find a better buff dip in proximity to rivertown!! The service could be faster and more attentive but it is what it is. They're generally really busy on sporting event days or concert days sometimes.. They have an overall decent draft selection and the prices aren't too crazy. I always favorite the salmon Blt sandwich because it's also really good. There are fire pits outside that you can sit around which are also pretty awesome!"}
{"text":"I have been to Rivertowne Verona and in Monroeville to eat and drink.  The have a hometown feel to them.  Dark and small, a little cramped, just the way it should be.  All around good experiences, but there is something about the Northshore one that feels like a franchise, not your local haunt.  Maybe too big, maybe too city.  We stopped in before a concert on a Saturday and everything was average.  Average service (actually a little under average), average food, average atmosphere.  Nothing to call home about."}
{"text":"Good food. They have health options. The kids liked it, we passed on the Carnegie science museum cafeteria. We walked down the riverfront it was nice."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting much.  Outside of [the best damn] pineapple beer you'll ever taste, what more could Rivertowne offer? OH. It turns out they offer one of the best SALADS in Pittsburgh. WHAT?!  We visited Rivertowne to pre-game before the big soccer game at Heinz Field.  What better way to celebrate futbol than with a bunch of hooligans drinking outside?  I was starving so we lapped up our share of $3 cans while waiting an hour for a table.  The host staff wasn't the most delightful, but it was slammed, so I didn't care.  After we were seated I [bravely] chose the grilled buffalo chicken salad.  I thought it would be mediocre but hey, #weddingwaistline.  What I received was a feast of epic salad proportions.  It was HUGE and that's saying a lot coming from me, a well-known bottomless salad eater.  First, having the choice of grilled chicken on something like a buffalo salad is rare and much welcomed.  I love the spice of buffalo but not the fried part that usually comes with it. So yay Rivertowne for this great option.  And to have it nestled on a bed of nice fresh greens complemented by a light sesame dressing was just thrilling.  Can't wait to go back and sample the rest of their surprisingly awesome menu!"}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of Rivertowne ever since the wife got me a day with the brewer at the Monroeville location.    Stopped in on Monday prior to the Pirates home opener for a couple of beverages.  This is not my first time here, but first time since I started Yelping.  The place get can get quite crowded during sporting events or concerts.  There is plenty of indoor seating and some sporadic outdoor seating but it is hard to find.    While it may be hard to get a seat somewhere or even a beer for that matter, the staff there is absolutely fantastic.  No matter what, hey are always willing to talk beer with you.  Even with a crowd, I was always able to find my waitress.  It is like she knew my beer was empty and knew I was in need of another (all done in moderation of course).  I find that many of the beers at Rivertowne are brewed to style, which makes them quite enjoyable for me.  I don't need a triple hopped, double oaken Hefeweizen. They have a nice selection across various different styles too.  They also carry some select beers that are not Rivertowne beers.    I have never had food here, so I cannot comment on that, but in perusing the menu it looks like your standard bar fare.    On nights where there is no game or even is when I find it to be the best.  That is when you can really sit back and enjoy the bar and the wonderful brews.    Definitely give this place a try if you are on the North Shore if you like good local craft beer and friendly service."}
{"text":"We had an awesome time at this location. Stopping for drinks only, we found that all drafts were $4 and also select pounders were $4. How do you beat that, honestly? The guy sitting next to us actually said that for happy hour, this price reduces to $2.50! I digress..... We sat at the outside bar, which needed a good wiping down, but it wasn't to the point of disgust. The waitress serving our drinks was plenty friendly and some of the other waitresses came over to chat as well, even though I know they were busy. There was a concert across the street so it was pretty packed up until showtime when everyone left- still, I do not believe this affected quality of service. Compared to all other locations, I prefer this outdoor area most, I only wish it was more spacious (N. Huntingdon location is good too, just a little reserved). Overall, we had a great time. Would love to come back for happy hour."}
{"text":"After eating here, I have now been to all the Rivertowne locations including the brewery and this one really isn't worth a return trip.  Came here with co-workers for a drink and a bite to eat before the ball game.  I didn't expect that we would have a 45 minute wait to get the first available table (with only one party supposedly ahead of us) which landed us outside in the heat.  I also saw several empty tables and wondered why we were waiting so long.  The food is not that good, no reason to wait 5 minutes for a table here let alone 45.  The hostess was not very pleasant.  She appeared to hate her job, maybe life too who knows.  If it was up to me I would have left.  In the world of business you play along with the boss no matter how bad it sucks.  Finally seated, outside, we get a waitress.  She was nice, but perhaps had too many things going on since she forgot a few things here and there.  Rivertowne mostly serves fried greasy food.  Their beer selection isn't bad though.  I opted for a side salad and steamed peel and eat shrimp.  The salad was underwhelming mostly made up of iceberg lettuce and a few green peppers.  They even had fried onions on the salad.  Not a fan.  The house made dressing was rather tasty though.  The shrimp was standard, no complaints.    Not a bad place to grab a drink if you can get into the door, but there are lots of options around the stadium that serve better quality food and hopefully you wouldn't have to wait that long to eat it."}
{"text":"Completely gutted the menu. No more tackle buckets, no more buffalo chicken wraps, and most egregiously...NO MORE PIROGI PIZZA!!! I won't be back."}
{"text":"Rivertowne Inn has the best wings in Western PA.  I'm not exaggerating.  They are huge wings that are very juicy and delicious.  Make sure you order the wings when you go.  I also like the Western Burger, it's tasty and succulent.  The waitress was attentive, enthusiastic, and helpful."}
{"text":"We had high expectations, as the food at Rivertowne in Verona is great. We tried the beer special, $3 for Anchor Brewing beer that was great. The fish sandwich was excellent but the fries were disappointing. The mushroom burger was very good, too."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of Rivertowne beers. I just don't love them. However, their food isn't bad. It's a good spot to come for lunch. The prices aren't bad, the service is really good, and the food is tasty. I enjoy their fresh cut fries, their wraps and their salads. Most recently, my mom and I came here after a long bike ride and were greeted by friendly waitstaff and overall had a great time. The portions are large here, so I was able to take leftovers home. The outside area is really nice and a perfect spot to eat on a beautiful day in the Burgh."}
{"text":"Warm beer. Flavorless food (artichoke dip and beer dip tastes like a block of cream cheese---blah yuck bad), mediocre service with a bit of a chip on her shoulder (bartender/server last night) and a trucker mouth. Patio area is alright but the river view is blocked. Would not consider returning. Just yuk."}
{"text":"Great location and great sandwiches.    Had lunch here one afternoon and really enjoyed the chicken florentine sub sandwich.  If the rest of the sandwiches are as good as this one and so reasonably priced then this place is a winner.  The location is between the stadiums and on the river, almost directly across form the amphitheater.  I was jogging in the evening along the river and the place was packed.  There was plenty of activity around since there was a home game for the Pirates and a concert going on at the amphitheater.  I was tempted to get cleaned up and go back but left it at being very satisfied with my lunch."}
{"text":"OMG! Our wings showed up PARTIALLY RAW and still feeling frozen in some parts.  We were a large group and ordered several buckets, but, that doesn't excuse the cook overloading the fryers to get them all ready at the same time.  Undercooked chicken....crappy training and controls Rivertowne! In addition to that the other appetizers we ordered (about 12 other plates) just sat under the heat lamps for literally 10-15min while the staff looked at them and tried to decide who was going to start running food out to the table.  What the fish?!?!  Grab a plate and go...hot food hot/cold food cold, please.  Also, not a manager in sight during this poor experience.  I had the stuffed lake fish which was actually pretty good and rich.  However, I did ask the server if it had imitation crab in the stuffing and she said it didn't...guess what it did.  Most others around me had the steak and said it wasn't very good.  Bottom line the food and menu has potential but the staff cooking and serving it is totally lost.  Poor management leads to a poor experience."}
{"text":"I love this bar! The food is great and the service is ok. If you're new to Pittsburgh I highly suggest stopping here for lunch or to stop and watch a game. Their beer is delicious and so is the food. Try their pizza or their pineapple beer."}
{"text":"Stopped in with a friend of mine before a Pirates game last week.  Very good chicken wings and a robust selection of beers on tap.  Chili nachos were just OK.  Friendly service and great location near PNC Park.  While not outstanding, still a very solid choice for pregame apps and drinks."}
{"text":"I frequent Rivertowne North Shore for a decent mixed drink and good ol' Pittsburgh atmosphere. I would have rather died then been there tonight. Once annually, the only meaningful All Star game in sports takes place where the national and American leagues face off to steal home field advantage from the other in the World Series. These human sloths had to \"ask someone\" to change the station from one of their 19 TV's that were on a summer league NBA basketball game between San Antonio and CHICAGO, which is about as relevant as a Ted Cruz bumper sticker. The only other entertainment on the televisions was commentary on a golf open that won't start for another 2 days.  Bye."}
{"text":"Slow service, shortened menu missing what we were looking for, poor beer menu description. Burger came out without requested bacon it was still in the bill after we mentioned it. French fries and ranch dressing were the highlight of the meal!"}
{"text":"The place was hot, hot, hot. Outside humidity was 90 percent. The windows were open and I was sweating the entire time. I had a burger that was good, my fries were cold.  The service was excellent. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I always end up at Rivertowne when on the north shore. Whether it be before a pirate game, or Steelers game. It is right in between Heinz Field and PNC Park. It is the perfect location. They have their own beers on draft which is great for a good beer enthusiast. They have great bar food. I was very impressed with their Pizza. It was of good quality and I did not expect that. I like it here much better than Bettis Grill. They have a nice outside area to sit down with food and drinks and a little fire place. When events are in town there is a DJ playing music which is a nice touch. It does get packed sometimes which is to be expected. The servers and bartenders do their best."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and every time I'm just not too impressed with their food.  Just recently, we got the Buffalo cheese fries (they have and picture of them and they looked good). They had a good flavor but there was way too much salt! Driving home I started to get a headache and all I could think was, WATER. like I was in a desert or something.   We also had a Jones Street Pizza, it was a good pizza. Nothing to wrote home about. The small was enough for my boyfriend and I. We've had the beer cheese before, it was grainy on my tongue, similar to powder cheese I guess... idk.   They have an excellent beer selection.  Nice outside patio. And bar access from inside and outside.   If you are going before a game or show, take advantage of the NoWait app because if not you will be waiting a while!   The service is fine. The bathrooms are clean. Pineapple beer is like juice and it's delish!    Don't get the fries if you have high cholesterol."}
{"text":"If you're going to the Northshore you'd be wise to include this in your stops. Love the atmosphere and the food and beer are terrific. Have had nothing but superb service, friendly wait staff, outstanding beer selection including some of their own Rivertowne brews (which are awesome). The food is, as you'd expect, of the bar food genre but with a twist. First of all it's cheap, Secondly there are some novel and interesting selections. Jambalaya submarine (highly recommended!), chicken florentine sub, the Pacino with grilled pepperoni, salami and cappicola to name a few. Be warned - a \"full\" sub will make your belly burst. Half is plenty -even for us big eaters.Third, everything I've ever had there is delicious!  The only downside is parking - tough to set this as a primary destination and try to find parking. But worth it once you do.  I've been to the Rivertowne locations in Verona, Monroeville, and Northshore. No comparison. Northshore is FAR better. Recommended!!!"}
{"text":"GREAT FOOD, GREAT BEER, GOOD SERVICE. This is a neighborhood place, it's great for seeing old friends and catching up with a beer. steeler and penguin games are usually crowded as well, so you have to come early."}
{"text":"They brew their own beer here and its great. Typical American bar food but they do it well. Its nice to have a place in this area that is open late. The bar tenders are on top of it and very nice."}
{"text":"Decent post-event atmosphere.  Friendly servers & fantastic fried food.  The breaded zucchini and Philly cheesesteak were worthwhile.  Beer draft selection is lacking but oh well.."}
{"text":"Medium Piranna Pizza was perfect for a very hungry adult.  The pumpkin beer on tap was better than most seasonals I've tried."}
{"text":"Just had lunch with my husband here, and was severely underwhelmed. It was Monday afternoon, no games or anything going on.   Service was ok; she wasn't rude but you could tell she'd rather be somewhere else.   We got the beer/cheese dip as an appetizer. It tasted like nacho cheese. The bread it came with was good, but the cheese was practically inedible.   We got burgers because they were on special, $5. For $5 it's a good deal, but for their normal price of $8.99, not a chance. It was a dry burger with some bleu cheese on it - that was it. Nothing exciting. The fries were good.  Now, it's our fault that we didn't complain because we're just not that type of people. But we won't be back."}
{"text":"I and my wife and another great couple eat dinner and had a couple of beers ,, good food  nice place  awesome service  more then a fair price  good parking  they definitely get a good review from me."}
{"text":"Blah.  Ok, some things on the menu, like whatever the salad is that has the blue crab in it, are stellar. Some things are downright disgusting, like for example, the calamari. Who the hell covers something fried in sauce? COVERS. Like, you can't see it. Whatever. Nothing about this place is off the charts for me, and as delicious as that crabby salad was, it's not enough to bring me back. We went there with some friends from out of town late because, well, they are open late. It was 2 hours before the kitchen closed and we inquired about desserts. The waitress said \"um I think there might be some cake or something but probably not. Do you want me to check?\" She returned promptly and dropped the bill on our table and said \"and if you guys could take care of that soon, because my shift is over, I'd appreciate it.\"   WOW. My BFF said \"so no cake, then?\" and the waitress says \"oh, sorry I forgot, it IS the end of my night, you know.\"  (Yeah, I do know, you've told me twice.) Probably like she forgot our drinks. And to refill the drinks another less than enthusiastic employee brought us after nicely reminding us \"this isn't my table.\" Sorry, I'd just like a drink to go with my entree, since I didn't get one with my appetizer.   And no, they weren't busy. I work for tips. This is unacceptable.  You get what you deserve sometimes, and she got nothing.   No thanks."}
{"text":"This is hands down, the worst tilted kilt I have ever been to. (and I have been to at least a dozen, from Phoenix to King of Prussia...) They don't have any of the TK beers (no knotty brunette, no dirty blonde, etc), and the staff is sub-par in appearance and service. This must be the island of misfit tilted kilt girls.  :,-("}
{"text":"New to the area. Have not been disappointed with the food yet. Pizza is great! Love the grilled chicken salads! My family raves about the steamed muscles. The prices are good and the waitresses are friendly. I won't hesitate to go back.....maybe even check out the DJ on Friday nights."}
{"text":"Looks inviting from the outside.  After glancing through the reviews I was good to go.  I am glad they offer a separate dining area besides the seating at the bar.  I was having a late lunch and didn't feel comfortable enough to hang with the happy hour crowd.  Very attentive service, nice menu of options, daily specials and soups.  Too many choices to look over when you aren't quite sure what the specials of the house are.  I opted for a baked Italian hoagie that wasn't baked.  The meat was grilled but that's about it. I was surprised  to see that their portions do not match their prices.  I asked for a half of a hoagie and was told that the 9.99 is the half hoagie price.  Meat and toppings were very sparse.   Half hoagie,  1 beer, and cheese bite appetizers came to 22.00.   I like the surroundings  and service but I might need to rethink what I order the next time."}
{"text":"We were told the wait would be 20 minutes. Turns out it was 45. So we didn't make the first inning. Why we waited I have no idea. The girls working there didn't seem to care, they were so slow. They also reminded us they \"only have two hands\".  Not to mention I think they needed to hire a few more people to help. The wings were $14 so I figured they would be the whole wings. Not so. They were the little wing dings. Fried to a crisp. All the portions seemed rather small I guess so you buy food in the ballpark, I'm not sure. Either way we won't be back."}
{"text":"While staying in Pittsburgh, we opted to stay on the North Side, to be near the stadiums. We were going to be tourists the next day, but were on the lookout for a place to grab some grub and watch some hockey. It was the New York Rangers home opener or something like that, but it was also the Pittsburgh Penguins home opener. So none of the TVs were tuned to anything but the Pens.   We opted to stop in to Rivertowne because it seemed a little more low key. I don't like big crowds, especially during sports events.  This place has a lot of beers on tap. I like trying different beers, especially draught beer. They have a lot of local ones that they make, too. The first one I got wasn't great - some pineapple beer or something - but the next one was pretty good. It was a local one, which I hadn't noticed when I first perused the list.  I got the appetizer sampler for my meal because I couldn't choose. It came with the bacon cheddar ranch fries, mozzarella cubes and fried zucchini. So much fried!!! The mozzarella cubes were probably the best. I was disappointed by the BCR fries, especially because the menu touted it so much. Everything was like 'upgrade to BCR fries, you won't be disappointed!'  In all, it was close to the hotel and was quiet. The two things I was looking for."}
{"text":"So stopped into this place after a long run of 12 hour shifts at work. I've always heard good things about this place and I would have to absolutely agree! I got the Maui Maui tacks and they were delicious! The meal comes with two sides so I got fries and onion straws. Little to my surprise it was a ton of food! My onion straws come on a separate plate to devour which were good and were cooked to my liking. The fries were home made and tasty.  Now as for the tacos it was fresh Maui with an interesting but awesome pineapple and salsa twist. Each taco hade 3 pieces of Maui deep fried to perfection. They were way bigger then I thought it was going to be.  My date had the steak salad which he loved and the steak was cooked to perfection. I didn't get to try it but it looked Devine.. Each meal came with a corn bread though which was a bit hard and dry but besides that it was scrumptious   Would like to try other things from there menu especially they seafood Mac and cheese"}
{"text":"The original Rivertowne location. Smaller than the others, but the same outstanding food and beers. A local neighborhood bar atmosphere, where other RT locations are more chain-like."}
{"text":"Aside from my too-salty burger, I liked the food. The Scotch Eggs were very good as was the chocolate stout bread pudding Darren and I shared. The service was a little off though and the music was WAY TOO LOUD! We could barely hear our server or talk to each other and my ears were hurting!"}
{"text":"Piss poor service. The idiot bartenders spend time on their phones. Disgusting garbage outside. This place is a fucking,king joke. Either the owners are totally stoned or they're simply morons to hire such dregs of society. Lord."}
{"text":"I have two words for you... Scotch Eggs. Hard boiled eggs, wrapped in ground sausage, and then deep-fried. Order these with any of the numerous beer selections and prepare for a delicious treat."}
{"text":"Before heading to Stage AE Saturday night this was the place to be for a little pregame, pre Snoop cocktail. It was packed upon entering but I managed to land the last seats with the flash of a smile at the gentlemen standing in front of them and a promise to flag down the bartender for refills. The hockey game was on and an excited buzz generated through the room. The doors opened at Stage AE around 7pm but I knew Snoop would not get on stage until later so we had time to chat and have some drinks. The selection on tap was decent and the menu was plentiful.   We struck up a conversation with the guys who let us sit and they got me even more excited explaining that Snoop does not disappoint but that he would most definitely show up pretty late. This info gave us more time to relax, and snack on a deep fried pretzel with our Guinness pints. Then they started playing some old Snoop Dogg hits to cement the jovial mood of the crowd. All the appetizers coming out of the kitchen looked tasty.  The only incident we had was that our buddies being a little inebriated spilled some vodka soda over my head. It was a trickle of booze and I laughed it off! In true Pittsburghese style the guy in blue plaid apologized profusely and bought us a round. I love Pittsburgh the people are incredibly amiable. Props for not being douches! As we walked over to the concert we left through the back of the building where a huge fire pit was going. I can imagine that in the summer this place will be so much fun! What a great view! Check out my pics. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Their Ruebens are incredible. A little pricy (I think a sandwich was $9?) but seriously sooo good."}
{"text":"Decided on this place for lunch before the Pirate game as there was no wait for seating when you ate outside. I really like the outside seating here- they have a large fire pit and decent sized tables, and somehow it is not too loud even with the overly dramatic \"hello over here! eat here! please?\" music blasting from the  obnoxious Tilted Kilt next door.    I didn't want anything too heavy so I got the Yinzer Cajun chicken salad w/ ranch dressing, my SO got the black n bleu burger with chips, and his cousin got the western burger.   I enjoyed my salad-- it was HUGE and had a variety of vegetables, French fries, delicious Cajun grilled chicken strips and hard boiled eggs. The dressing also tasted homemade, a plus. The cornbread muffin was terrible and very dry, it tasted stale to me. My boyfriend enjoyed his burger and chips, though he said he couldn't hardly taste the gorgonzola cheese; which is odd because Gorgonzola/bleu cheese is typically pretty strong-tasting. His cousin really enjoyed his burger as well. Overall, they RAVED about the fire sauce that they each asked for to dip their chips in.   Of course, it was game day and the whole North Shore was bustling with people, but the service is very, very slow here. Our waitress frequently checked on us, which was great, but the food just takes forever! It is definitely a habit for Rivertowne because my SO and I came to the same location on a weeknight for dinner several months ago, when it wasn't busy, and it was the same way. They just do not have a pep in their step when getting food out to the customers!  I will probably come back again, just because they have a nice variety of foods and the outdoor seating is pretty awesome, but I'm still not head-over-heels for this place."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Rivertowne and I must say, I was not impressed.  The floors were slippery and the the menus were sticky.  Not exactly great adjectives to describe a place I was about to eat at. I got the Asian shrimp wrap which was okay, but nothing I couldn't have made myself. My boyfriend got a cheeseburger that wasn't juicy at all and was served on a \"toasted\" (pretty sure it was just dried out) bun.  I suggest only going for the beer if you go at all."}
{"text":"I joined Yelp just to tell my story of my most recent visit of Rivertowne on the North Shore of Pittsburgh. I have been coming here for years. I even had my sons college graduation party here. We loved the place and highly recommended it to everyone. However, it is time for this restaurant to close. I was awaiting my husband to join me and was seated in the restaurant in view of the kitchen. As I sat there waiting, I heard the cooks talking about me. I honestly cannot repeat what they were saying to each other about me. It was disgusting. Once my husband arrived, I told him. He was about to get up and punch someone when we overheard the cooks call him a racist word! I could not believe what was happening. We got up to leave and the cooks said and I quote, \"I guess you don't like N****** cooking your food!\". This is so unacceptable. I will NEVER and I mean NEVER come back here again. I will tell everyone I know not to come here. There are so many places to spend your hard earned money."}
{"text":"The draft beer was only $2.50! Great place to Hang at before a ball game with reasonable prices. Good selection and enjoyed some unique brews like Mala kahiki. The pizza is great as well and I recommend the youghiogheny pizza. Yum."}
{"text":"We stopped by here for dinner after a Pitt event at Heinz Field, and we really enjoyed our visit!  Great draft list with a selection of their own beers brewed locally, but also a healthy mix of other beers including Southern Tier, Guinness, and PBR.  I got the Buffalo Chicken Wrap with grilled chicken.  It was the right level of spice for someone like me that has a bit of a sensitive palate!  I got a side of cole slaw which was fresh and quite tasty.  Service was great, very attentive.    If I could give 3.5 stars, that would be my ideal rating. It was good food for bar food, but not amazing.  Definitely some place to stop before or after a game, but not something I would make the trip for specifically for this."}
{"text":"I've come here a few times for happy hour. It's okay. Half off appetizers is great and they have a good beer selection, but the food is just mediocre in my humble opinion."}
{"text":"Came on St. Patrick's weekend. So it was very busy in the bar but we were seated quickly.  Food came quickly.  I had the Reuben and it was tough and bland.  Fries were not hot.  My wife had the scallop sandwich and enjoyed hers.  Beer was good.  Waitress couldn't be bothered with us."}
{"text":"The food is good, but overpriced. The service used to be great but not so much anymore. If you're not in a hurry, it's good, but if you need to eat and go, then find somewhere else."}
{"text":"A good place to go to before a concert or sporting event. Food is good but I particularly like the beer selection. The Rudolph Red is a seasonal beer (a spiced red ale). Easily one of my favorite beers."}
{"text":"Food is OK; beer selection is good.  I was surprised not to see your typical Budweiser/Coors/Yuengling selection, but rather a few of Rivertowne's lighter brews and a wide selection of heavier craft beers.  On Wednesdays any Rivertowne beer s $3, boneless wings are 50 cents, and jumbo wings are 75 cents.  (I think this is from 7-10pm.)  They have other daily specials as well, but we were here on a Wednesday.  We tried mild, fire, and cajun bourbon flavors--my advice would be to stick to the classic buffalo/hot sauces.    My husband and I watched the whole first Pens playoff game here (we sure picked a good time to move and therefore be out cable for a week, eh?) and our waitress was the perfect balance of attentive and laid back. She let us hang out and watch the game, but also made sure we had everything we needed.  Overall, I would recommend this place if you're at the North Shore already, but maybe not if you have to go very far to get here--it's a typical pub scene and parking can be a bit of a pain."}
{"text":"The hubby and I stopped by Rivertowne for dinner just a couple weeks ago before a concert. I had previously had a drink or two here in the past but had not ever sat down and eaten dinner.   Service was underwhelming. It took our waitress some time to greet us initially and to take our order. At one point, we were ready to order our entrees, but she left our table so quickly that we didn't have time to tell her that we were ready. Also, for being a restaurant with a number of alcoholic beverages, our waitress knew very little about what Rivertowne offers. Though a nice girl, I think Rivertowne could invest more time and training in their employees.  I started with a beer and almost made a face when my beverage was brought to me in a tiny plastic cup. I get that Rivertowne is heavily trafficked from Heinz Field, PNC Park, and Stage AE attendees but that doesn't mean you should be able to both serve beer in a throwaway cup and charge full price.  Finally, the food... meh. I ordered fried fish with potato wedge fries. The fish was OK, but the flavorless wedges required ketchup to be consumed. Plus, I was a little turned off by the dish initially when the man delivering the food stated, \"Here is your catfish.\" My catfish?! I definitely didn't order catfish. I questioned him about it, and he just seemed confused.  In the future, I would prefer to walk a couple miles to downtown and pay less money for more and better food. I don't plan on returning."}
{"text":"This place is garbage. The food is terrible quality. We got the raw tuna for an appetizer. It literally looked like it came out of a can and had zero flavor. The presentation was sub par. Just a pile of lettuce slapped on the plate. I got the catfish and it was burnt and possibly bad (this fish itself was actually gooey). I chose not to eat that. My boyfriends burger was so so, how could you go wrong on a burger? Service was also below average."}
{"text":"After having eaten there a few times, my favorite thing to order is the Buffalo Chicken Salad. Everything else I've ordered is kinda small on the portions, but this salad is definitely enough to keep me satisfied."}
{"text":"Well I came here after a Pirate's game since its just down the block from the stadium. I was not impressed at all. The staff basically walked around like zombies. My water had some gross soapy stain on it, at least that is what I hope it was. My food lacked any care in it being made. I just didn't feel as though we were really wanted there. I wish I just sat at the bar, since the bartender seemed to have more life to him than his server counterparts. Maybe next time I'll go before the game with there might be more life in the staff."}
{"text":"The beer and service was exceptional.  The food was decent, great happy hour prices- I wouldn't come here for the food alone based on what I had. The service was really great! I'll definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"I've stopped in multiple times when going to events on the north shore and this is the most consistent experience of the restaurant options to choose from in that area. Most recently I had the salmon blt  and was really surprised at how good it tasted. The sandwiches do not come with sides however the portion of the sandwich was large enough no sides were necessary. Served on Italian with lettuce, tomato, and a dill mayo (which I ordered on the side) the portion of salmon was larger than other salmon sandwiches I've had elsewhere and it was cooked perfectly - not dry at all. Of course bacon makes nearly everything better and I was happy it was crisp how I like it. The dill mayo gave a nice sauce for the salmon. Service was very attentive although we were the servers only table so no surprise there. My companion enjoyed the California burger ( no onions) with a spicy sriacha sauce which he said was very good. I'd also recommend any of the pizzas (Mon River Extreme is my favorite) as they have always been good. If you enjoy beer I'd also recommend trying the hala kahiki Rivertowne branded pineapple beer and Old Wylie's IPA is also a good one. They have a lot of other craft beers on tap too if none of the Rivertowne branded beers are appealing."}
{"text":"Great place outside of the city. They have great food and better craft beer on tap. They have other breweries available as well as cider.  The yinzer salad is a good choice with fries and protein. Can't go wrong. Good location to eat before or after a pirates or Steelers game."}
{"text":"Went here after the Pitt game- should have waited the 40 mins across the street instead. When we walked in, the place smelled like vomit (which, I get it, it's a bar, those things happen, it wasn't a big deal)- we were seated pretty quickly and the hostess was friendly enough (and probably tired from working a game day). We ordered a couple of burgers and some beer. Beer came out in smallish plastic cups- c'mon, it's a brewpub! Serving an oatmeal stout in a plastic cup is cruelty to beer! Beer tasted great, so we ordered another round before our food came- which came out in slightly bigger plastic cups? We shrugged and said \"whatever\". Our food came out- nothing special at all, but not bad- typical sports bar fare, but for a $10 burger it was a lot of food, so there's that I guess. Then our check came- over $50 for 2 burgers and 4 beers in plastic Dixie cups?! Yeah...beers were $8 each- not listed on the menu anywhere. Pretty displeased, and I think if I want beers from here, I'll be buying a 6 pack instead."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me on my recent trip to Pittsburgh.  After trying out another brewery where I wasn't really impressed with the beer, I was told they have a really good IPA here.  This place is on the first floor of the Del Monte building near the pro sports stadiums in Pittsburgh.  It is across a walkway from a Tilted Kilt (we have one of those in Charlotte).    I sat myself at the bar here.  The bartenders were young.  I could have been twice their age and apparently the more I sat here, the more the business crowd left and the crowd got younger and younger.  I didn't feel comfortable here.  But again, I was here for the beer.  I ordered the Wiley's IPA which was recommended to me.   It was served to me in a plastic Miller Lite cup.  Really?  I can understand the plastic cups on a game day but there wasn't one this night.   A good beer isn't served in plastic.  VERY DISAPPOINTING!  The beer, however, was decent but glass would have made it taste better. Trust me.  I stuck around for the food and they have a very broad menu with salads, sandwiches, steaks, etc.  Nothing really stood out here but I opted for a pork loin entree with apples and caramel sauce.  The pork was good and the caramel sauce was interesting and worked well with the apples and pork.  I know from my Pennsylvania Dutch background that pork and apples go well together.  Anyway, this seemed more like a college bar to me than a brewpub.  I really wasn't impressed much except for the beer but it should have been served in a glass, especially when it was your own beer."}
{"text":"I went on a wing night (Wednesdays). They have the best jumbo wings! The sauces could be better though. However, the staff are terrible. All of them stood around on their cell phones and looked uninterested in servicing customers, and there weren't many of us here. Kylee was our server and we only saw her twice. Once to take our order and then to drop the check. A cook actually brought us our food!!! I observed her on her cell phone, and beer sampling sitting on the back bar top (health code violation btw) the rest of the time. No visible manager in sight. If you want to try the wings I would recommend going to a different location, I usually go to the one in Verona, service is much better there."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Would not visit Rivertowne ever again. Came at 12:20 and sat outside. Never acknowledged by a server."}
{"text":"Take me out to the ballgame.  Take me out to the crowd... BUT I don't want peanuts or cracker jacks.  I also WON't bay $8 for a cheap beer.  Instead, I go to Rivertowne.  If you're looking for grab a beer or a quick bite before a Pirates game, Rivertowne is a great stop.  With an extensive tap list, including their own brews, your cup should never be empty.  They have a HUGE nachos appetizer, juicy burgers, even pizzas to fill your tummy.  Don't have tickets to the game?  No worries!  There are plenty of TVs so you can catch every pitch.  So skip the long lines, pricey beers, and cold food and head over to Rivertowne."}
{"text":"I've been there many times for drinks and the beer and bar atmosphere is decent.  However the food & service stinks.    I took my family there for lunch recently and it was a horrible experience.  The waitress was extremely slow.  It took 25 minutes just to order food and we rarely saw her.  She also brought out our drinks with her hand on the top of the glass.  When the food came out, they forgot my daughters order and the salmon in the salad was raw.  It took another 20 minutes to get a new salad.  The burger was good but rest of the food was poor.    Its a shame because its such a great location."}
{"text":"I think that \"mediocre\" may be a smidge too generous to describe a recent visit here. We were seated on the patio, placed our drink orders, received said drinks and some food, and then had to hunt down our waitress to order anything else. There were two servers working the patio, and we saw more of the other person than we did our own waitress. When one of our party asked for a manager, he did adjust our bills, to his credit. The food was fairly average bar fare; I think the appetizers were stronger than the entrees. My coworker enjoys going for drinks and apps, and I could see why.  Their house beers were good, and the list was admirable. I particularly enjoyed the setting along the river- very nice patio where you can watch people who insist on exercising instead of drinking beer on a patio on a summer night. If the dining experience could keep up with the lovely surroundings, they'd have a real hit on their hands."}
{"text":"I would normally give this place 3 stars... it's a \"bro\" crowd, which is definitely not my scene.  But they have a great menu, are relatively inexpensive, and the whole menu is available Late.    An odd mix of Pittsburgh, Brit-esque pub, and experimental bar-food, the menu actually works!  I got the Pittsburgh sandwich which was impressive due to the huge amount of real turkey on the sandwich!  Yeah Real turkey!  Also tried the homemade chips with honey and bacon... surprisingly simple and tasty.   There are tons of craft beers available, thought I'd love to see a banoffee (especially considering some of the more British menu items like Scotch Eggs and Fish and Chips). Course, I understand that you can't cater to everyone.  I'm sure I'll be back on future excursions to the North Shore."}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent service, one of our new favorite restaurants in the Pittsburgh area."}
{"text":"The rivertowne in Verona is a pretty decent place. The bar setup is a bit awkward and the beer selection is primarily their own beers, which is ok by me. The food is very good though. Great pizza and some interesting selections not sonomous with bar food. Had a really tasty appetizer of jambalaya balls. Really tasty with just enough heat. Also had the southern grits and shrimp. The grits were very tasty for bar food and the blackened shrimp was cooked and seasoned perfectly. The only knock was the sausage in the dish. It was really a store bought ekrich farms kielbasa, or at least that is what it tasted like. Really could have used a fresh andouille instead. Would have really elevated the dish. They also have one of the only authentic scotch eggs in the city, second only to Pipers Pub."}
{"text":"Nopenopenopenooooope. Came here with a group and it was a poor experience all around. Firstly, they  didn't have our reservation on file. We called (about 3 weeks ago) and assumed everything was in order. We were seated, but there was a lot of confusion. At some point, someone told us that they don't take reservations? I don't know... it was all a blur.   I ordered the Lemon Chicken Chopped Salad because it sounded delicious! \"Encrusted lemon chicken, cucumbers, candied almonds, apple slices and romaine lettuce tossed in a Fuji apple dressing. Served with a side of cornbread.\" This was probably one of the worst salads I've ever had. The lettuce was brown and wilted. The chicken was waaaaay dry and the \"crust\" was burnt. The cornbread was also really dry. Sadly, I left 95% of the food on my plate uneaten.  The restaurant was not very busy, but service was terribly slow. Again, we were with a large group so I didn't expect any of this to be quick, but it was two hours(!) before I even had food in front of me.   There are way better options in the North Side."}
{"text":"Ok, the following review might be because we were here right before a Pirates game,but anyway...my husband and I visited Rivertowne because we both like their beer.  It wasn't great.  The music was blaring and we had to yell at each other to hear.  They were out of the Hala Khahiki and that's my husband's favorite.  We ended up sitting near the bar and ordered beers.  I thought that because we were at the restaurant, I'd get a draft, but got a can.  The waitress didn't ask.  My husband did get a draft and it was in a plastic cup.  We only ordered an appetizer, the portabello mushrooms and flat bread.  It looked nothing like the picture and I think the flat bread seemed stale.  I was totally disappointed by this experience.  Normally when we visit a brewery/restaurant, there are glasses for the beer and it's not really a sports bar atmosphere.  Not what I expected at all."}
{"text":"I was here with a group from work before the Pirates game.  It was a great day - possibly the best weather day so far of 2018 - and we sat outside facing the river in the dappled shade of some trees.  It was so relaxing, a great place to chill with some colleagues.  The very good Mon Trotter Irish Stout surely helped with the relaxation!  It is a smooth and mellow drinkable beer.  People who are turned off to dark, heavy beers should give this one a try.   A big surprise to me was the burger.  To be honest, I chose it because it is the cheapest item on the menu. It proved to be one of the tastiest burgers I've had and it was proportioned just right.  The Swiss cheese was thick, and the other toppings were doctored up someway that added a subtle flavor that worked perfectly.  It comes with BBQ chips, and if you want fries you got to pay an extra buck. Forget that!  The chips were a perfect finish to the burger - oh, and don't forget to keep a few ounces of that Stout to wash it all down!! Delicious!"}
{"text":"What a great place to eat.  First off, the enviorment at this place was unreal.  My dad and I came here before going to the Steelers game, and the atmosphere was just excting.  I wanna come here just to watch a game.  While sitting in the stadium I kept thinking back to Rivertowne thinking, \"wow i bet everyone in there is enjoying the game and having a blast together.\"  If you cannot get tickets to go to the game, go here and grab some good food and make some new friends.  With that being said, lets move on to the goodies.  The appetizer we got were the Wileys Mushrooms.  I scoped out the menu before coming here, and I knew I was going to order these before I even walked into the front door.  They were excellent.  Cheesy goodness, mixed with some peppers, and of course the delicious mushroom.  Not to mention it was served on a sizzling plate.  It was completely gone within a minute.    My dad and I split some garlic parmesean wings.  Now I gotta say, I have become a garlic parm connoisseur over the past couple years.  I have to admit these bad boys ranked real high on my top list.  They were not flooded in garlic sauce (this could be a turn off for some people depending on the mood you are in), but I was satisfied with the \"garlicness.\"    Moving onto the main course.  I got the Baja stuffed fish.  This thing was some kind of white fish that was jam packed with crab meat.  It was amazing.  From now on, if i am in the mood for fish, I am going here.  I have no clue what kind of \"white fish\" it was, and I don't care.  It was that good; i promise you.  A little side note was that the veggies that came with it were great too.  I wish I would've gotten the double order that I asked for, but it was no big deal; the place was packed, so you have to expect little mess ups from time to time.  My dad got this burger that had a piece of kielbasi on it.  He loved it.  Right when we left he was already talking about trying to recreate it once we got home.   I did try a bite, and I have to admit it was good.  Like I said this is not only a great place for food, but also a great place to watch the game or just hang out.  Luckily I have one of these right near my house.  You can bet ill be visiting another Rivertowne before this month is over."}
{"text":"Been here a gazillion times... pre-Steeler games, pre-Pirate games, pre-Stage AE concerts. Service has always been good, food, well, I'd put it about average. But the atmosphere is perfect to pre-lube an event. And the beer selection is the best for this side of PNC Park.  Last night I had an Evil Genius, Purple Monkey Dishwasher Chocolate Peanut Butter Porter. It's not as far out as it sounds; it's actually pretty good and perfect for the below zero weather we experienced last night. My girl and I split a chicken quesadilla and some bacon cheese fries. The fries were just okay but the quesadilla was delicious. I'd recommend the Rivertowne over any of the other places between the two stadiums. It's simply the best value for your buck and it sure beats going to an event early and paying their inflated prices."}
{"text":"Excellent & varied beer selections plus delicious reasonably priced bar food. Their menu offers a large variety of sandwiches for around $7. Friendly waitstaff is also a nice bonus. You can add a stop here on the Northshore before or after a game and not break the bank and enjoy the atmosphere.   Just not sure why they have a towel lady looking for a tip in the bathroom. Unexplained mystery."}
{"text":"Me a bunch of friends were at rivertowne for a half hour at the outdoor bar during the regatta and was unable to get a drink in thirty minutes.  And this was early in the day when it wasn't to crowded. We went across the street to bar louie and got a drink immediately.  I don't blame the bartender for this I blame the terrible management who only had one bartender for the day of the regatta where every other bar had four to six bartenders working. Terrible services"}
{"text":"I've been going here for more than a year . Their buffalo chicken dip was great, then it was really bad, and now, its amazing! (No lie, it's way better than it ever was.) The beer is still so so but I recommend this location. It's better than most neighboring bars."}
{"text":"I'll say this: Rivertowne must have done something about the noise after my previous visit OR it was because a bunch of my fellow metalheads had taken over the joint before the Black Label Society concert at Stage AE since reasonably audible selections from Pantera could be heard sans an annoying DJ or hip-hop bass thump.   I met some pals here prior to the big show for a quick dinner and was mostly pleased.   Speaking of quick, Steph, our agile, amicable server knew I had little time to dally since I arrived later than my friends, so when I decided that I wanted the Cajun Catfish Submarine, she got it in front of me as fast as a truckstop chuckwagon would.   Spicy, breaded, and garnished with lettuce, tomato, and an aromatic housemade olive relish, the supple fish was a tantalizing hybrid of Louisiana and Londontown flavors, making it an appropriate meal considering the following opening band's Southern-fried, Sabbathy strains...  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrBI0ADonA0  The housemade potato chips were a little inconsistent in terms of crispness (some were soggy, others were dead-on), but that would be my only caveat, Rivertowne showing that they remain a more than decent dining option priot to or following an event on the North Shore.   And I still got to Stage AE in time to catch these chicks...  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nfD0qJE0lA  Hails and horns to Rivertowne."}
{"text":"Después del estadio, una cerveza bien Helada, el servicio medio mal, la mesera lenta, solo una cerveza y fuimos"}
{"text":"Tailgating is essential for NFL games almost everywhere. You get there at 8 am and start indulging in awful behavior which may result in you hating yourself for a bit. Sometimes you may not have a crew to go with that day and it's just you and your buddy, if you don't find a group to tag along with, you're stuck with a lame tailgate session. Not here in Pittsburgh, they got Rivetowne.   Located right near Heinz Field this is the place go to before a game if you're not tailgating. It's not like near it and then take a five minute Uber or a ten minute train ride, NO! It's right next door. And the place gets nuts before a game.   People are just drinking outside in the area. Having a good time. Partying. It's like a tailgate at the bar. I can imagine you'd want to bundle up in the colder months being right on the river, but it a blast this past summer before a preseason game. I can only imagine how crazy it gets during the regular season."}
{"text":"I am beyond disgusted right now and mortified that I ate my meal. We had lunch on a cloudy Sunday afternoon.   We read the menu carefully and ordered accordingly. When our food arrived, it all had ingredients that we were not expecting. The buffalo fries and buffalo tater tots were all hiding blue cheese that wasn't mentioned on the menu. Blue cheese is either something you like or you don't like. We don't like it and were extremely disappointed that it tainted our appetizers. It is mixed in so was not even avoidable. We also ordered beer cheese which was thin liquid, looked like caramel, had a weird shininess to it and tasted so strongly of chemicals that it was absolutely inedible. Our meals weren't much better. My Pittsburgh Sandwich was hiding raw onions.   The service was missing as well. Our waitress was nice, but nowhere to be found. We were the only table on the bar side and the dining room side also just had 1 table. Our food was delivered and we were never checked on. There were 3 employees sitting at the bar talking. We sat without water for the majority of our meal until my bf went to the bar and asked for a refill. I soon understood why there was nobody at Rivertowne when the surrounding restaurants had lots of full tables.   While empty, the environment was so loud that we couldn't hold a conversation with one another. The staff was playing music on the jukebox, but the loudness was unbearable. It was a little excessive considering it was a Sunday afternoon.   The deal breaker was when I used the rest room after our meal. It is absolutely disgusting. It is covered in black soot looking stuff. The walls were filthy. The hand dryer, the soap dispenser, all was coated with black dirt. There are restrooms that need attention, maybe need the floors mopped, the toilets wiped down or products restocked. This was like something I've never ever seen. I am absolutely sick to my stomach to know that I consumed food at such a dirty establishment.    We will never, ever, ever go back and I'll probably never get over the nausea thinking about our experience."}
{"text":"Great food and Amazing drinks! They changed around their menu again and took away the specialty mixed drinks : (  But they cab still make them. The fishbowl is fantastic and u cannot beat their long islands!!! Also the pizza selections are unique, peirogy and bbq are the best! The spinach artichoke dip with flat bread is my personal favorite."}
{"text":"I stopped here with seven coworkers prior to the Pirate game for drinks and dinner. This was my first time at Rivertowne. The food was really good. We had cheese squares, scotch eggs (hard boiled eggs wrapped in sausage and deep fried), pretzels, Stromboli, wings, fish sandwich, and salmon blt.  I can't stress enough that the scotch eggs are off the hook. I would solely go back for the scotch eggs. However there is a downside. Our service was lacking to say the least. It took too long to get drinks and a second round of drinks just didn't happen. For a bar restaurant, this is not acceptable."}
{"text":"We went to Rivertowne specifically for the wings - and were not disappointed by this fantastic fare. Their monster wings come out fast, piping hot, and seasoned to perfection. I could, literally, eat buckets of the wings. My husband enjoyed few of their IPAs; and, I had a glass of delicious black cherry Also, their kid menu is actually kid friendly. The staff is very friendly - and the environment is comfortable and welcoming. We will absolutely be back again (especially since it's in our neck of the woods)!"}
{"text":"Rivertown North Shore is the newest north shore eatery, if you want to eat like a Pittsburgher this is the spot, especially if heading to PNC Park or Heinz Field for a game. The menu is extensive appetizers, salads, sandwiches, steaks, chops, seafood and they are now brewing their own beers. One of the sandwiches on the menu is the \"Pittsburgh sandwich\" can you Yinzers guess what that is? I'm really sick of the cole slaw and French frie sandwiches and the restaurants that feel the need to cash in on the original. Hint to all you imitators, try using seasoned fries on your version of the permanti's original! Back to Rivertown, big sandwiches, huge salads, fun starters like scotch eggs or deep fried stuffed pretzels, amazing! Their pizzas are perfect for two people to share. Their burgers are big and thick with generous toppings. The bacon cheese fries are a heart attack waiting to happen, but take the chance! On the whole Rivertown is your basic Pittsburgh eatery, with French fries on a salad with steak and ranch dressing. Or kielbasa on a pirogi pizza, this is true Pittsburgh food, hearty and sticks to the ribs."}
{"text":"My wife and I went about a week ago, towards 930pm, to get a pizza and some beers after work. When we got near the entrance we noticed a man sitting on a stool, taking to another man in a nice dress shirt. Their conversation wasn't too appropriate but I could get past it since it was late.  Any way, we were asked to show our IDs, something we never had to do here. While we were showing our IDs we could hear loud music from inside, almost like we were entering a nightclub. Strange, thought we were going to a restaurant.  When we did get in, the sign said to seat yourself which was fine since there was a DJ playing loud/awful music, while dancing like an idiot. After we found a seat in the dinning area, which was 75% full already, a waitress came over and RUDELY said \"this section is closed!\" and walked away.  How was this possible when the dinning area was nearly full and the sign said to seat yourself? The bar area was full too. Both my wife and I were furious and walked out. The man whom was dressed nice, assuming the manager, just looked at us while we left and said nothing. NOBODY CARED!!!!  We used to come here at least once or more a week and now we really don't want to go back. I had two growlers that I used to get filled with their beers too, but on how badly we were treated I think I'll use those growlers at Giant Eagle."}
{"text":"Why I didn't eat or drink at Rivertowne today:  I showed up at Rivertowne today because they have the NFL package. I sat down at the end of a sparsely populated bar on a Sunday afternoon in front of a smaller TV on the side that nobody was watching. I asked the bartender to change the game because I was out on Sunday afternoon to watch a specific football game. The bartender seemed a little annoyed because they had just set up the games on specific TVs. The game on the TV in front of me was the Raiders - nobody was watching it. I asked if it could be changed to the Bills/Jets and she brought the manager over. The manager seemed annoyed as well and explained that there were 3 games playing and the TV in the corner was currently showing the Raiders game.  ... thanks, that doesn't help. They were unwilling to change the channel, shift games around, or do anything at all. Again, there was nobody interested in that TV or really the 2 TVs around it. So I left and took my business elsewhere. With Bettis Grill and the Casino bar within a stone's throw and being much more accommodating, I'm not sure what the hangup was and the benefit of being so inflexible. I won't be back soon"}
{"text":"My wife and I had Pirate tickets and the day off from work. We explored the river walk along the North Shore and wanted to eat early before the game. We decided to try Rivertowne. Went in just in time for happy hour and tried the IPA (excellent). It was in a plastic cup...so what! It was 1/2 off. We split a dozen wings and fries (amazing)! Whole wings not the ding and crispy (the way a great wing is deep fried). The fries were hand cut, delicious and a very nice portion to split. The atmosphere was great. Glad we got there early because the place got packed and on a big wait around 5pm. The server was excellent. She was very knowledgable of the food menu and beer selection. She was busy but made time for us. Plenty of televisions with sports on all channels, music was rocking on the jukebox and everyone seemed to be having fun. Overall the food was a 10, service was a 10+. I can't wait for baseball season in 2014. This is a great hidden jewel in Pittsburgh and we will do it again this spring."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of the various disappointing restaurants around the North Shore.  This one, didn't by any means blow me over, but it didn't totally disgust me (see Tilted Kilt review).  I had been staring at the place for months during my walks around the North Shore or heading to a ball game.  There are windows that open up to the outside were they sit people bar style in the warmer months.  It's pretty cool looking and a really great idea.  I was always intrigued, but never able to stop by.  I'm definitely going to choose this place next summer!  But I digress....  We stopped here after a party one night to grab a drink and some snacks.  It's a pretty wide open space to grab a big table for drinks.  Our server came up to us immediately to get us a round of drinks.  The Pumpkin Beer I ordered tasted like Yuengling...a little disappointed, but not the bars fault, just the mysterious brew.  However, the car bomb we ordered tasted delish, so all was forgotten (literally?!).    I didn't eat any food but what was ordered looked like pretty decent bar food.  I was a little put off by the fact that the \"bucket\" of fish and chips weren't filled completely.  They put a bowl on the bottom and wax paper between to \"fill\" it all the way.  Pretty cheap if you ask me.    I'm going to go back and get the food....because the atmosphere was decent.  And decent for the North Shore is all we gots right now!"}
{"text":"Well i have been here 3 times in the past month. So i got a feel of what the place is like. So the first  time i was there it was packed before a show on Stage AE beers cheap during happy hour.. So we just got beers and drank them outside on the patio. The next night we had another show to go see at Stage AE. Went with other people and got a seat at the bar section. Our waitress Kristen was horrible. You couldnt here her it was like she was in outer space when you talked to her.So we got some apps and beers and left very disapointed. So just last friday i took my mom to the pirate game and thought i would give it one more shot. Bad idea, it was packed but again i was able to find a booth. I got my order right away because i knew happy hour was ending. My mom took about five minutes she came back and took her order. 35 minutes later we still did have her sandwich. I had never cancelled an order and i do not fault the waitress as she checked on it 15-20 min in. But we told her we have to get to the game and got my check and left. I feel that the staff needs more motivation. they seems like wailking zombies and not much interaction."}
{"text":"This is a good local bar.  It's a bit of a dive, but it's got a good jukebox and the food is surprisingly good.  The pizza is great and the other bar food is good.  They have a great beer selection.  I think over 200 beers.  The crowd are all pretty much locals.  Most are pretty welcoming.  They try really hard here with some of the extra stuff they do; poker tournaments, djs, bands, etc.  The rivertowne pour house in monroeville is the sister restaurant and it's good too, a little bit nicer.  The bartenders for the most part are very good.  This place gets really busy sometimes on the weekends.  However, I tend to only go on Sundays and weekdays"}
{"text":"Always enjoy the bar staff. Lots of great food, for a bar. Shrimp and grits are probably my favorite."}
{"text":"Amazing ambience. Had the cajun chicken pasta! The best I had till now. Amazing service and great food. Lively crowd. Definitely going back again and again!!"}
{"text":"A few coworkers and I came to this establishment for a few refreshments. It took well over 25 minutes to get our first drink. The restaurant was dead, but the bar was a little busy. By no means slammed, and with 5 people behind the bar things should move a bit faster. Over all the service was horrible. One girl looked like she just got out of bed. I would like for it to be known that all of our group work In the service Industry. We know good service and we r very good tippers. I will never go back. Thanks again river town. U guys suck."}
{"text":"Good comfort food and nice beer selection. The Stromboli is awesome. This a great spot for locals and visitors alike."}
