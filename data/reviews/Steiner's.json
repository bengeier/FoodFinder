{"text":"Went with my daughter tonight and was refused due to her under the age of 21. Both employees were very gracious in explaining the NV law and offered for us to wait in the foyer if we wanted something to go (which we didn't). A few other reviews mention the smoky atmosphere which it true but again not there fault since that's there decision on how they have licensed there business. Vegas could use a family friendly Stieners because there food is consistently excellent (on all my previous visits)."}
{"text":"2-for-1 happy hour and a delish Reuben in a friendly atmosphere. What's not to like?!  it's a good place for lunch or a simple dinner."}
{"text":"First impression: I sat down at the bar which had a not so friendly reminder to not sit at the bar unless your playing max bet and stating you can't \"sit on a $20 bill\" that is what it is, I get it. The bartender came over and brought me a drink promptly  I ordered the chicken fingers as recommended from the bartender. The bar top \"bar buddy\" table adapters are unstable to say the least. After eating one of the 4 fingers, I put a bit too much weight on the front end of the bar buddy and the entire basket of wings, fries, and a hefty amount of ranch dressing came spilling onto my lap/ ground, immediately I felt embarrassingly sober and childish. After I came to terms with what had happened, about a minute passed and someone came over and swept up my nearly untouched basket of goods, to whom I apologized for my mistake. As any normal human would after wiping up the food on my lap, I wondered what's next? Will the bartender say \"Hey man, no sweat I'll get you another one\", or, \"would you like anything else?\" Something I feel is the respectable thing for a dining establishment to do, but after 40 minutes of sitting at the bar and running another $60 through the 4-card keno machine, nothing...NOTHING. Not a single word of the 1/10 of the meal I got to enjoy. I'm not self centered nor do I buy into the strict reality that \"the customer is always right\" I realize I made the mistake, but it really didn't sit right with me that the bartender never said a single word about it, the company I was with commented on the same thoughts that were running through my head. Giving them the benefit of the doubt, we thought maybe they wouldn't charge for it, maybe half-off, something. But in the end... nope, full price charge, never said a single word the entire time we sat there.  The food was quite good (for what I got to have) but the complete lack of empathy/ general customer service will assure I will never be attending their establishment again."}
{"text":"We have been regulars at Steiner's for several months now, but last night killed it for us.  After waiting until after 7PM so that we could sit at the bar (my wife broke her back as a kid and needs a chair with support), we sat and ordered dinner.  We had already been there an hour when the bartender informed us that we had to move because someone wanted to play the video poker game I was seated at.  Instead of telling this other person to wait for a bit, they caved when she said that we weren't playing and shouldn't be sitting there.  This is poor customer service.  While we love the staff there, and will miss them, we will not be back because it is obvious that gambling revenues are more important than the clientele."}
{"text":"We love hitting them for breakfast (like we did this morning) when we don't feel like being good.  Their Rampart Country Fried Steak breakfast is huge and one of the best I've had.  I agree with many of the other reviews on their specials and we've tried several over the past year.  Wish they would post them a week in advance on their web site for planning purposes for those of us who are retired.    Their reward program is also one of the best.  And we just love their staff - !!!!"}
{"text":"I normally come every Sunday during football season. Today was a spur of the moment decision. Sat down to my favorite Asian bartender in the US. She recommend the wings which were phenomenal. Also ordered the Kobe burger. Took it home, opened the box and found two ROTTEN tomatoes which smelled worse than organic fertilizer and just as mushy. Took it back to get a new one, where I was told it was normal for that kind of tomato to smell, look, and feel like a decomposed body. This asst manager clearly has no idea what food or customer service looks like. Luckily the GM was there to smooth things over. If it weren't for my bartender, I would never set foot back in this place again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend came home with Chicken Frittata ...oh my gosh!!! It was so delicious, large portion, with grilled asparagus and bread sticks... He was told by many to try it because it is really good--im so glad he listened, it was soooooooo yummy, I would go back myself and order just for me. Lol We love this place. Also, the Fresh \"huge\" pretzels here are the bomb"}
{"text":"Loyal customer of 7 years no more!!! For seven years we made steiners are #1 choice for food,drinks,and good times. The service was amazing. Your glass wouldn't be 1/2 way gone and it was refilled. For 7 years we never had a bad experience until recently. We went for breakfast a new waitress was on the morning staff friendly at first but not attentive only greeted us and gave us the check. She didn't even notice we were not eating our breakfast except the toast as the hashbrowns were burned and the eggs were extremely undercooked when we asked for medium. We thought it was just an off day.... Then we went back In last Saturday for dinner around 5:30 fearing we would hit the rush we were surprised how dead it was.... The 3 waitresses saw us come in as we debated where to sit. We waited 15 minutes and no one came to the table. But they all walked past us many times and then were chit chatting at the counter in front of the kitchen laughing.... We decided to leave. As we got up the waitress walked by who saw us come in and said have a good night we turned to her and said you never even waited on us. No apologies or nothing like come back were sorry will take care if you. So we went to timbers were we were greeted right as we walked in and had a waitress at our table less than 30 seconds. 7 years of being loyal customers, we even went on their bus trips, had birthday parties there.... What a disappointment. The service has done a 360 because there is no service!!!!! Will not go back guess timbers is our new bar of choice."}
{"text":"Great  neighborhood bar!  been coming here for years...   Highly recommend Mondays and Fridays to go see Sunny.,  she is smart, intelligent and kind..  a breath of fresh air.,   Thank you Sunny for all you do for your customers.,  you are appreciated more than you know!!  Merry Christmas ., Angela C"}
{"text":"I went to Steiners to gamble and get a bite to eat. I was greeted by a blonde bartender named Max. She discussed the specials that Steiners had to offer, so I decided to get the Portabello  sandwich. It was delivered the way I ordered it and was delicious!  She was very tentative to all of her patrons at the bar, their drinks were always full and delivered with a pleasant smile.  The bar is clean, organized and tastefully decorated.   I will certainly be back soon!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this place. Their happy hour is amazingly cheap, the service is pleasant, and the food always hits the spot when I want bar food or a hearty breakfast. There are a couple of locations in my neighborhood, and the food, atmosphere and drinks are consistent between the two."}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service. Definitely a perfect spot for Monday night Football because they have tons of specials and drawings. Try the French Dip and all of their soups. Kobe Burger is phenominal as well."}
{"text":"The food is wonderful, some of the better dishes I've ever had. But months or a year ago they stopped letting anyone under 21 into the restaurant, so I no longer go because I don't want my son to feel left out. Great food, bad management"}
{"text":"Stopped at Steiner's on the way back from Death Valley since there was a \"pub\" craving. Fish and chips, burgers, beer selection, and smoky environment left a ton to be desired.  Fries were good, but not good enough that I'll return."}
{"text":"My salmon is so over cooked I have use a knife to cut it, mashed potatoes are dry and crumbly. Bad bar food."}
{"text":"Good food, nice bar, well stocked, and Good service too. The only thing I didn't think was great is they asked me to move grin a slot chair when no one wanted to play."}
{"text":"The lamb chop appetizer was awesome.  Cooked to perfection with a light  creamy horseradish sauce.  Waffle chops were fresh and cooked to order. The service was OK.  The menu looks really good. As for the bar.... It looks like a basic Vegas bar with machines.  I'll be back just to try out the food."}
{"text":"We've been in a couple of times and it is our new favorite neighborhood place!  I'm not a big meat eater but the fish tacos are frikkin' amazing and their homemade clam chowder was excellent!  The salmon I noticed was farm-raised (prefer wild-caught) unfortunately but still selected it as my entree.  Happy hour had an okay/basic selection of wines for me and plenty of beers for my bf (he was very happy).  Service has been warm, attentive and very friendly from the great bussers to servers.  We sat in a booth away from the bar/gaming area and didn't notice any smoking, maybe it happened to be light on our visit?   Really a great place so far and we plan to be back more and more for great pub food and drinks."}
{"text":"Steiner's calls itself a \"Nevada-style pub.\" But this food is so good that it would work well anywhere.  I have been here a half-dozen times, and I always get the same thing: a small order of the Mediterranean salad with lamb chops. It's basically a souped-up Greek salad topped with three grilled lamb chops. But, man, are those lamb chops tasty! And although you can order the chops by themselves as an appetizer, I think it's a better deal to get them as part of a salad.  My husband had the Cobb salad; the full order was huge, but he nearly ate it all. We each had a large draft beer (Miller Lite for him, and Blue Moon Belgian White for me), and if you're just there to drink, you can't go wrong with their extensive beer menu. It looks like they have a pretty good happy hour, too, and I know several people who like to play video poker here and at the sister location down the street.  It's funny I don't come to Steiner's more often; maybe that's because it's not that close to my house, so it's not in the front of my mind. But I like this place well enough that I'm going to try to remember to stop in next time I'm in the mood for some good bar food. And maybe next time I'll try something else off the menu: a burger, perhaps. Or maybe the Cuban sandwich... (Naw. Why mess with a good thing? See you later, lamb chops!)"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with anything on the menu, everything is bomb! Always a good time spent here with all the TVs on there is always a good game to watch, paired with some great beers!"}
{"text":"We love this place. My parents took us there just after we moved here to Las Vegas and we have been totally hooked! We are there at least 2 times a week and we take all of our guest from out of town there! GREAT Service the food is AWESOME and it is  a \"comfy\" place to hang out! 5 stars and 2 thumbs up from us!"}
{"text":"I've been to this bar a few times now. The location is super convenient, which is an absolute plus. The service here though is absolutely terrible. I walked into meet a few friends, where I sat at an almost empty bar for a good 20 to 30 minutes waiting to be greeted. That means no drink either. Not only were we ignored practically the whole time we were sitting at the bar, we were treated like crap when Cheryl was finally offered us her terrible service. Especially when were playing $200 bucks at a single machine. Working in the industry, it's unacceptable. I'll game and drink next door at putters from this point forward. If you're not a regular under cheryl's schedule.. don't come to this bar. Not worth your time or money."}
{"text":"Smells like an ash tray in there now.  I'll never go back and will tell everyone I know to stay away until they clean it up."}
{"text":"Steiners is a solid place to grab good bar food. Its better than your typical bar menu and has a large selection of all types of food. Burgers are a specialty here and seem to get my attention most of the time. Had a big Bacon Burger and it was everything a bacon burger should be!   I would recommend this to anyone looking for a bigger than average selection of food!"}
{"text":"I've been going here for a while now. My mom lives up the street from this location and I usually make a stop here on each trip to see her. Over the years, the service, quality and selection has been going downhill. It is still probably better than a lot of places, but not as great as it once was. Fish and Chips are usually my standby or maybe one of their salads. They used to have a dozen degrees of hotness for their chicken wings, but the last few times in, their menu didn't indicate it. Onion rings are generally good, as long as you get them freshly made. They do have pretty good beer selection, plus they have specials all the time. Overall, it's decent place to grab some food, maybe watch a game or have a beer."}
{"text":"This is as good as it gets. For my Chicago Friends & Family, this is the place to go and chill. First: I actually win there its not a lot, but I win. If I don't win playing Black Jack or Keno, I always seem to have my players card in at the right time during their hot-seat cash drawing (usually $5-$15). Second: The Bartenders are the best. Charyl Lynne, Michelle, Mandy Cheryl and Cristy art top notch!! The Afternoon/happy-hour folks are the best in town. They know my name and I never have to ask for a drink! There's always some kind of Party scene going-on at happy-hour time. Fun-fun-fun!! Lots of people from Chicago frequent the place too. The clientele here are great people, and they have your back covered. Roger (The Owner) is approachable and fun to talk with. If you have a problem, he'll fix-it and make it right. Food: Tops for me is the Lamb Chops during happy hour. They're the best! The massive imported pretzels and cross-cut potato chips are the best! Its all great. I'll see you there. Just look me up! Ask for Jimmy!"}
{"text":"Always good. Tonight on impulse walked there and back on a crowded Friday. Won about $80 for $20  on machine at bar. Not bad, even if my sandwich was no good."}
{"text":"Coming here was somewhat of a tradition for my husband and I after he would have a late night at the office and our dining options were limited. We had our booth and would order several items off of their appetizer menu and share it tapas style. The servers are always attentive and friendly. The food is solid for bar food and very reasonably priced. Generally we enjoyed their wings, potato skins, nachos, and kobe sliders. I would say the wings are my favorite followed by their nachos. We did not partake in consumption of adult beverages therefore our total bill was always surprisingly reasonable. At times the smoke did carry over to the dining area and for that I am docking a star. Now that we have our daughter, late night runs for some late night snacks at a bar are on a hiatus until further notice."}
{"text":"Whoever wrote the 1 star reviews must have been suffering from severe PMS and needs a fresh supply of pads to soak up all the massive verbal hemorrhaging coming out of her pink iPhone keypad. The service from all the bartenders is nothing but impeccable and Max is an awesome bartender. I'm sure that whatever she may have said to this irate customer was to protect the reputation of her establishment and not to delve into anyone's personal life. Being in customer service,  I can judge somebody all I want,  but the fact is if you're ruining the experience of other customers,  it doesn't matter what your personal struggles you're going thru, i'm gonna tell you 'You're out! ' Order the Ruben omelet. It's the best."}
{"text":"We went to this location last weekend. It was very dark, and the waiter said there were lights out that had not been replaced. My husband had the fish and chips, and they were dry and hard. We usually go to the Buffalo location and never have a problem."}
{"text":"I've lived in Las Vegas since 1995. Steiner's opened their first location in '98. Tonight was my 1st time dining there. I've missed a lot!  Great food & service. Had a Mediterranean salad topped with three grilled lamb chops. Thought I'd died & gone to heaven. They added jicama to the other ingredients, which was marvelous. Asked for the chops to be grilled medium so they weren't dried out.  They were perfect. On the side were pita chips done in a way I've never experienced - topped with cheese & baked. I could have rolled in those!  Overall, a great dining experience. The only reason they don't get 5-stars is that I'm too short to climb up on their bar stools!  Had to take up a table for 4, or ask for a ladder."}
{"text":"Buffalo wings are very good, order extra sauce (HOT) on the side. Beer selection in cooler is extensive! Hop Box, Dales Pale, Sculpin, etc. Good beerz.  Busy at happy hour. Staff is friendly and they cover the floor well even when its packed.  Enjoy this place!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good,  but it's a little greasy. That being saif, you should be here for the brew mostly anyway. Very nice vibe inside, true sports pub feel. Friendly staff, and huge portions, we have plenty left over for dinner!!   We used an Entertainment coupon, no problemo, we will be back, it's a cool hangout. Can't wait for football season, plenty of flat screens wherever you are in the pub."}
{"text":"Uh who messes up pancakes? Thin cold pancakes on which the butter would not melt. I had the special and it seems the pancake batter was old or over beaten, and she served them and the bacon cold. I usually opt to not eat here especially for breakfast BUT HOW DO YOU NOT MAKE FRESH PANCAKES WHEN YOU ONLY Have FOUR PATRONS DINING. NOT a good idea ...the replacement pancakes were hot thin and a bit raw. Boo"}
{"text":"Love this place! Best chicken fingers in Las Vegas! Great customer service! The employees are always friendly even when they're slammed! I I always do take out and my order is always ready, fresh and the exact way I asked for it!"}
{"text":"Stopped in after a day of golf. Waitress was prompt and got our beer order to us quickly. Football was on the tv which was why we came in. Food was good and selection of beers was above normal. Atmosphere was excellent. The Venetian sandwich ordered by a friend said it was excellent. I had the fish tacos which were average. All in all good place to go."}
{"text":"Came in for a very late night drink. This place is pretty cool I literally live walking distance and have never been non the 2 years I've been in Vegas lol. I'm glad I went that night though. The music is very up to date the bartender (forgot his name) was very casual and talked to everybody at the bar. Enough TVs around the bar and I heard they have amazing food but I have yet to find out  till next time"}
{"text":"Always been FAN of any of the Steiners locations. I generally go too the Buffalo location but mixed it up this time going too the Cheyenne location. Lot of reasons am fan of Steiners not only cause of the food, Best Happy Hour in Vegas, tons of television for sports entertainment, great service, and one of the few sports bars non casino has the NHL package. Just for the NHL package worth star all its own.   I came for some Thursday night football with my roommate and some NHL games (specifically see my roommates Rangers). I surprise packed the place was considering was Thursday. Not sure if always that busy cause we barely found spot at the bar too hang out. MLB playoffs going on, NFL, College football, and NHL full night of sports on. More into the drinking mood. We did get HUGE pretzel too munch on with our beers. It was pretty good! The presentation is one of those WOW just because of the size of it. The pretzel was nice moist, hot, and warm from the first piece break off. Choosing the best way take it down that story for another time. It came with three different dipping sauces. Whole grain, honey mustard, and darker one (really out of the three least favorite; not distinct flavor, looked burnt, not very good). I have had food here before mostly the sandwiches and really not had bad one.   The beer selection is Huge its whole another menu by itself. The best part is Happy Hour ALL THE DRINKS  are two for one whether big or smaller draft or even bottle beers. It covers the world from micro brews both coasts, craft beers from all over the world, ciders they have vast selection too choose from, and always adding new ones so am sure there beer for any beer lover! Me! Me! Happy Hours 5-7.   Sports bar this is the place just cause the way they have the televisions set up from the ones above the bar area. This area like best in the middle of the restaurant (same set up as the others) row of bar stools, bar tables, and on one side decent size widescreen main games on and both sides smaller televisions. Look at the other side up in the corner two more smaller television. Most part different game going on all of them. Depending busy you can ask them change the games. Your own personnel sportsbook!! NHL package just like the NHL is game that not everyone fan of. I love HOCKEY. Few bars that every year gets the NHL package. If looking for favorite NHL team this is the bar too hang out at.  Promotions they always have something going on. I never knew but NFL games they give out free shots evert touchdown.. Sure its free taste ok but catch nice high scoring game some of the best free shots!    Service never had bad one. Servers are attentive, usually come for HH make sure remind you get that last HH order in whether fill or not, and managers there very much present checking up on guests really on it."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Steiners for 20 years and never had a bad meal!!!!  It's definitely my 'happy place '   It's not only good food, and great service, it's many wonderful memories!!"}
{"text":"Food will take a while to get to you, the bus boys take better care of you then the waiters, and that's who deserves the entire tip. If you sit on the left side of the dining area, by the door, the table tops smell like Copper and you'll forever have that smell while you eat, making the food not so enjoyable."}
{"text":"A bit smoky for a non smoker, that is the only reason it is not 5 Star. Staff friendly and attentive. Food reasonably priced for portions, had wings cooked crisp like I like them, medium sauce had the perfect heat and flavor. Fries were very tasty. Crazy number of beer to choose from. Ample tv's for the NBA finals, I will return. Happy hour until 7pm? Unusual."}
{"text":"Great bar food and awesome service. I would definitely recommend this to everyone that loves a local bar. On the other hand wished they had some bar games like pool table or darts. That would put it to the max."}
{"text":"No, don't roll your eyes at my 4 star review of Steiner's. At least take a gander of the beautiful Caprese Artisan Tomato/Fresh Mozzarella with Grilled Chicken accompanied by watercress, arugala and basil that is the Tuesday Special Salad. Yes, they have daily salad specials and this one was so perfect I ordered a second to go for lunch Weds.   Steiner's has always been a go to for better than average bar food, and now they are offering creative healthier fare (and delicious - I didn't even use the dressing. Each bite was like summer garden freshness in my mouth) They still have the yummy baby lamb chops, burgers my carnivore friends rave over (and any burger can be ordered veggie or turkey form) breakfast, and buffalo shrimp among a very eclectic menu.   Four stars is also for the service. Though you seat yourself, usually someone greets you as you find a spot. I like the community table away from the main bar, but close enough to see a game on one of the many TVs. If no game is on that interests me, there's free Wi-Fi. You get the feeling that there's a regular crowd as my very helpful waitress Stephanie (pointed out the new salad, and on another occasion filled me in on the Steiner's card, which earns points for food & drink for non gamers like me) seemed to know most of the folks who came in. It's the small touches that I appreciate: water glass is always filled, I'm asked if I want a to go box before asking for one and on this occasion, she even let me know Happy Hour was about to end in case I wanted to \"freshen\" my cocktail. She was very busy with said regulars but I always felt looked after. The manager was on the floor and seemed equally familiar with the regular crowd, interacting with guests warmly.   Many late nights I'll stop into the bar to grab a salad for work the next day, and the bartenders are always welcoming and food comes up quick.   For all of these reasons, and especially price to portion ratio, Steiner's is indeed a 4 star joint I'm happy to have in my neighborhood go to options.   Now, remember, a different salad every day (\"my\" salad on Tues) summer is coming just in time to cool off with a cold drink and refreshing salad. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I like this place. It's a nice sports bar with lots of TVs. Their food is good. I don't usually eat meat so I was surprised that they offered the vegan Boca patty as a substitute. My husband tells me their meat dishes are great, too. The prices are reasonable and everything is clean."}
{"text":"Oh Steiner's, what a wonderful place to grub and grab a few beers!  I can't say that I have ever had a bad experience here before, been about 6 times.  I have sat at both the booth for lunch and the bar for drinks; both offered great service.  I started going to another pub across the street because they had golden tee, but the service there became awful (the bartender).  So, I started going back here and I have to say, SO GLAD that I did.  The food is much better and the bartenders' actually carry on a conversation with you.  Furthermore, I have yet to come across any pig-headed guys or crazy chicks, all the patrons are fun, easy-going customers.  If you're ever near this Steiner's and craving a drink, food, or both- stop in and give them a try.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to try this place for dinner as we are new to the area. Very crowded but it was Friday at 7 so that was to be expected. Once we were seated service was very fast. My wife had the rueben sandwich and I had the fish and chips. Everything was cooked perfect with good size helpings. My fish was flaky and the fries came hot. There were several items on the menu that looked good so we will defiantly be back."}
{"text":"Great place for happy hour.!  The lamb chops on the sampler platter are to die for.  The wait staff is on the ball and friendly. I would be comfortable as a woman. To come here alone."}
{"text":"They have a good selection of beers here. We decided on Alaskan Amber Ale. Yummy! We also had chicken wings and potato skins and we loved them. We come here frequently and the food is always great."}
{"text":"Just love this place.  It's pretty much a weekly routine for me and my BF.  The breakfast croissant sandwich is delicious.  You can also earn points for dining and then they send you a $25 gift certificate.  They also send a certificate for your bday and anniversary."}
{"text":"It's Friday 5:00pm-- where should I go to get my happy hour fix? Came here straight from work after a looooong week! I heard about their 2 for 1 drinks and had to check it out.   They have a crazy amount of beer selection! I'm not much of a beer drinker but I do like trying fruity ciders or ales. Decided on blackberry cider ($5) and pear cider ($4). It's 2 for 1 so basically we got 4 beers for $9. That is a steal! It's pretty much a beer lovers heaven.    During happy hour appetizers are either $3, $6, or $9! So for Food-- I decided on the steak nachos ($6). These were pretty damn creative. On top of each tortilla chip is all the ingredients in nachos and the cheese was melted on top surrounding all the ingredients. So it wasn't messy like nachos usually is. You just pick up the chip and eat it. Of course the portion isn't as big as they usually are but it still filled me up.   The beau got the chicken wings with fries ($6). Pretty good. I liked how the wings were just the right amount of hot. The fries stood out to me. It was crispy and seasoned just right. They weren't just regular ol' fries you find at a bar.   Atmosphere is pretty laid back. There's bunch of TVs for the games. It was pretty packed when I got here but our server, Jose, did a good job checking on us."}
{"text":"Ive been living in the area for nearly 2 years, transplanted from the East coast and love a local pub to enjoy food and drinks after a long week at work. Ive been going to this Steiner's now for around 6 months and love it. The staff is friendly and nice, the food is fantastic and the 2 for 1 happy hour cant be beat. Its got a nice neighborhood feel, the patrons, the staff, and atmosphere is just what the Dr ordered. Id recommend it to anyone. Love the Prime Rib special on Friday, as well as the Burgers. The appetizers are great, lots of beer on tap as well as good drinks that are on the Happy Hour menu. If you get the members reward card, you get points per purchase that get you $20 gift certificate you can use at the Pub for food and drinks. Nice perk."}
{"text":"I love the food at Steiners, I always have. The waitstaff is fast and friendly, and they are attentive. The reason I give it three stars is because I can't take the smoke in there. I went in to have dinner and literally left feeling like I smoked a pack of cigarettes. I had to take a shower when I got home!"}
{"text":"Great food! But staff and bartenders are awesome and Max the bartender is amazing she always takes great care of her customers and myself a lovely employee and makes my experiences at Steiners great!"}
{"text":"Battle Mountain Buffalo Shrimp is six deep-fried whole shrimp tossed in hot sauce and served with celery, carrots, Brew City Fries, and cool ranch dressing for dippin'. The shrimp are huge (16/20) and lightly battered which will remind you of fried chicken. It is perfectly fried to a crispy golden brown. The shrimp is perfectly sauced so it not so messy. The dressing is awesome! Tastes like homemade and reminded me of Bob's Big Boy. The fries are done to perfection with tender potato inside. Rating: 5/5  Death Valley Chips are homemade, crispy waffle cut potato chips tossed in Yosemite Sam Steiner's Spicy Seasoning blend of Lawry's Seasoning Salt and paprika. These chips are criss-cut thinly on a mandolin and fried to light crispy perfection. Ask for some ranch or bleu cheese dressing for dipping! Rating: 5/5  On Fridays, New England Clam Chowder is on the menu. It is creamy and chock full of clams. The blend of vegetables adds a great flavor to the creamy base. There is a unique kick of cayenne pepper to keep your taste buds happy. One of the best clam chowders I have ever had! Rating: 5/5  Oasis Cobb Salad is crispy iceberg and romaine greens with rows of diced chicken, avocado, bleu cheese, bacon, tomato, and a halved hard boiled egg. The greens are fresh and crisp, laying the foundation of one of my favorite salads. The chicken is tender and cut into perfect bite-sized pieces. The flavors of creamy pungent bleu cheese, smoky, salty bacon, creamy avocado, and rich yolky egg come together for the perfect Cobb salad. Ranch or bleu cheese dressings are perfect on this salad. Rating: 5/5  Sea Breeze Mediterranean Steiner's Pub Salad is a mound of crisp romaine topped with a dressing of marinated cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, jicama, and green peppers mixed into a balsamic and herb vinaigrette and served with crispy pita chips, kalamata olives and sprinkle of feta cheese. You can choose to top this salad with 3 lamb chops or grilled chicken breast. We went with the lamb and a fine choice it was. The lamb chops are fantastic and grilled to perfection. They are tender, juicy, and full of flavor. The gaminess is subdued by the rosemary and olive oil marinade (I personally like the rustic flavor, but tasted great all the same). The Greek compote dressing on top has just the right amount of flavor to flavor all of the vegetables. There is no need for extra dressing. All of the vegetables are crisp, fresh, and vibrant. Rating: 5/5  Flamingo Chicken Sandwich is topped with homemade bourbon barbeque sauce and a mound of fresh coleslaw. The sandwich packs a 6 oz. skinless boneless chicken breast that is tender and juicy. The coleslaw is creamy. You can ask for it on the side if you don't want it on your sandwich. The bourbon barbeque sauce works perfectly with the chicken and coleslaw. Rating: 5/5  Sinful Frozen Cappuccino Sundae Pie is coffee ice cream layered with fudge on a peanut butter rice krispy crust and drizzled with Hershey's Chocolate Syrup and fresh cocoa. It's reminiscent of a mudslide pie but what makes it unique is the peanut butter rice krispy crust. I've never had anything like it. You gave me just the crust and I would be a happy camper. The coffee ice cream and fudge layers meld together into a mocha flavor which is always great. I can't wait to order this again! Rating: 5/5"}
{"text":"Go here all the time gamble a tone of money, stoped by tonight to play some games .... bar was full of people at least 8 people just sitting not playing machines just Sitting ... I asked bar tender if he could free up machine he said no I would have to wait for someone to leave ..... WOW .... I have been coming here for 10 plus years and I will never come back ...."}
{"text":"2nd time here. Good food with a decent beer selection, but the service is terrible. Our servers trainer today told us it was ok to smoke at our table since we're so close to the bar. Then the GM came over and told us \"nay\". My server and trainer couldn't be any worse with drink refills. Went to the bar twice myself for refills. Can't decide if I should give this place a 3rd try."}
{"text":"Nice place in a decent area! Staff members are friendly and the main customers are locals. They offer food, drinks, and gaming. A nice place that's quiet and secluded"}
{"text":"Had nachos.  Were really good but portion was small. Beer was cold but not cold enough. Service was good. Atmosphere was good. It's close to home so I will go back.  The best part was the chocolate molten lava cake for dessert.  It was extremely good. Must try dessert."}
{"text":"A new neighborhood spot local bar with super yummy food they have an amazing tuna melt and we also have the Mundo Cowboy hamburger which was delicious and let's not forget how yummy their side of ranch for the fries was"}
{"text":"Great breakfast this morning.  Great staff and outstanding environment.  This morning's staff rocked it even though they got busy.  Well done."}
{"text":"Came in for breakfast breakfast was great coffee was good and hot expert cook perfect my pancakes were delicious and might I say so was the bartender I've been coming here for many years this is the first time I've Yelp Steiner's but it's been a great place for many years who was working the service is great I think the bartender's name was Cheryl Lynn you all got to stop in and say hello to Cheryl Lynn and have breakfast or lunch that's all great"}
{"text":"Steiners is a local bar with seriously amazing quality food for a very reasonable price. I love the vibe here with the dark wood and decor. The staff and owner really do an awesome job running the place. Super friendly, great atmosphere, and the best food are why I keep coming back."}
{"text":"While visiting family in Lost Wages they took us here for an early dinner. This was back in May, 2015. I recalled I wanted to leave a review and bookmarked the place. Now, it has been so long ago and the meal was so mundane I can NOT even recall what I ate! Must have been the stroke I recently suffered; hell, I don't know LMAO! I do recall it was \"okay\", but nothing to write home about. The service was very good, I do recall that. Would I eat here again? Sure, if the family wanted to do so. I personally would not go out of my way to pick the place, especially with so many other places to eat in Lost Wages."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming in here and having a Beer or two or three with friends.  Sometimes I bring my family along....but that's only for food.  One of my favorite dishes here is the Kobe Burger.  It's a must try if you're a fan of Burgers.  Overall, it's a good time but it's not a place we come to very often.  Will I return?  I'm sure I will."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood eatery! Good food, reasonably priced w/ a great 2-for-1 drink Happy Hour. Top Notch!"}
{"text":"Just Ok I wasn't impressed foods good just not my kinda place"}
{"text":"Terrible service ! The food is nasty and taste like it was frozen food from a tv dinner . The waitresses and bartenders are rude and all have bad attitudes . Don't even bother with this trashy place ."}
{"text":"As a last-minute decision this was a fantastic place for a late-night food fix. The staff was friendly and the food was fresh, delicious and quite filling. I highly recommend the Venetian chicken sandwich with the Vegas Chip fries."}
{"text":"Always a fan of Steiner's.  Had my first visit at this location just recently, but have been to the other location off Las Vegas Blvd at least 15+ times.  The LV Blvd location actually recommended that I try this one.  So, here I am.  As soon as I walk in I immediately noticed one thing.  This place is built and layed out exactly like the LV Blvd location.  Felt like I was in the Twilight Zone for a minute.    Service here is just as good as the south location, which means great service.  I ate at the bar where service is always good since you have a bartender there.  Food was just as good and you can't go wrong with their Kobe anything.    Like the other Steiner's, it's a little dark inside.  Like other pubs, the air inside can be a little smokey.  These are the things I notice now that I no longer smoke.  But I can't complain since it's a pub in Vegas.  One difference between Steiner's and other pubs has to be their food selection.  There's enough of a variety for everyone."}
{"text":"Good bar food, but nothing special. The service is lacking and you will sit for a long time with an empty glass. Especially if you are having a nonalcoholic drink, us soda drinkers just don't get the same service as the boozers. The French dip is really yummy though. They also have great French fries."}
{"text":"I came to Steiner's last week becasue I wanted a Reuben and I saw theirs was recommended.  Little did I know that I was coming on the same night as the NBA finals last game.  I don't follow hoops.  So I was kind of frustrated when they switched the channels from a baseball game and a hockey game I was watching in favor of the NBA finals.  How dare they!  But nobody else seemed to mind so oviously I was in the minority.  Regardless, I was here for a sandwich.  Not sports.  And a sandwich I got.  It was not the kind of Reuben I was craving.  The sliced thin and stacked tall beef with cheese, sauerkraut and dressing like at Jason's Deli.  It was thicker sliced beef and not stacked as high as I wanted.  Still, this was a good sandwich.  Great flavor. Plenty filling.  Dry rye bread with just the right amount of dressing to help it down the gullet.  Actually more cheesey than what I had wanted.  And that is not a bad thing.  Cheese is good friend of mine.  Although this was not what I had pictured in my mind,  I did not leave disappointed.  And that is a win in my book.  Also, the coleslaw on the side was respectable.  Not the best slaw I've had but nothing to scoff at.  Service was also commendable. I was seen by at least four people.  One who took my drink order.  One who took my food order.  One who brought my food to the table.  And one who removed my empty plate.  They were mostly quick to my table.  And friendly.  This surprised me given how busy the place was on this final night of the NBA season.  Kudos to Steiner's for a job well done from a belly well fed."}
{"text":"I get off work late and while I would love to be one of those girls who heads straight home to sleep, I'm always starving. Steiner's is on my way home and I always leave this place happy and stuffed.   Every single burger I have tried is amazing. The chili burger, oh my god. And don't get me started on the fries.   They are always short staff late at night, but still give you quick & friendly service. For the price, you can't beat it."}
{"text":"Service and food were great. I had the panther panini and it was very tasty.  It was busy but our bus person (Sean) and server (Nicole) were very good about asking how food and drinks were"}
{"text":"The Club!   My friend was down from Oxnard and after going drinking we decided we were hungry. I LOVE a good club sandwich, and luckily he shares that affinity!   The menu is huge, but we came for them clubs! Legit the most perfect club I've had. I always get one on sourdough, he opted for white bread. It comes with turkey, avocado, swiss, lettuce, and bacon. I like it because they don't put ham, and its a true club with the 3 breads. They do not skimp on the fillings, and the fresh avocado is so delicious, it's accompanied by some delicious fries and a pickle spear!   It was just so so sooooo yummy! It's 10.99 and so worth it!  The waitresses here are sweet, and the bartender is awesome!  Yay!"}
{"text":"Ordered food to go. Amazing.  BLT, quesadilla, chili and creme  brule  The fries are the bomb, sandwich great. Quesadilla was huge and delicious. Chili was good. But the creme was ok, not sweet enough and a tad grainy but overall I give the food here 4.5 stars. I will be back"}
{"text":"I've come here many times. Always good. The fries are the best here! Kobe burger, sliders, chicken tenders, and their sandwiches are good!"}
{"text":"The best happy hour in town. The best chicken wings in town. The best lamb chops in town.  We haven't had anything we didn't really like!  They allow smoking... which is an automatic loss of a star, but it is a bar. Food is good enough to deal with the occasional smoker."}
{"text":"I ordered some food to go. Chicken fingers and a french dip. When we got there my husband noticed they had made us chicken wings instead of fingers. They said they would make the fingers right away it would be 10 minutes. (I was waiting in the car) I told my husband to go back inside and let them know they would have to  have to remake everything because our fries will be soggy as well as the bread on my french dip in 10 minutes (plus driving home time). When he went inside to let them know they told him they were able to give him some fingers someone else had ordered and sent us on our way. The French dip is meat on bread. Absolutely no seasoning what so ever. The ajus tastes like warm oily water. There was no taste at all. I wasnt impressed with the chicken fingers either. Inside they were very dry not a lot of meat. Overall not worth $20. I won't eat there again. The fries were good as well as the ranch."}
{"text":"I've been here numerous times as its just around the corner. The food alone gives this local bar 5 stars. But if I could, I would give them 10 for what I witnessed tonight. Of all the bars I've been to in Vegas, I have never seen a manager leave the establishment to bring a customer back inside because they were too drunk to be driving. And then they went above that, gave the customer a menu to eat any item on the house. That was probably one of the best things I've ever witnessed.   Afterwards, my family and I noticed the lady was still stumbling on her way out after eating and after a few minutes of convincing, she eventually let us drive her home. When we got back the employees and managers thanked us and even offered us some dessert or drinks. Huge kudos to you guys. You made our night."}
{"text":"Have ordered so many different things on their menu and every single thing has been delicious! Let me just say that if you like Philly cheesesteaks then you'll probably LOVE their Philly cheesesteak fries. They're amazing. Also, the reuben is great and their salads and breakfast are always generous portions and reasonable prices. The staff here are always friendly too."}
{"text":"The food is always good, a very nice place to sit back and have a few drinks. I've been to a few taverns in town this one is best by far."}
{"text":"Avoid at all costs. The dining experience couldn't have gotten much worse, save a hair or bug in the food, here at Steiner's. From very mediocre food (of course they ran out of their nightly special, as well) to completely neglectful service (yes, you, blond pony tail girl!), this was completely unpleasant. Decided to give our neighborhood Steiner's a try instead of the go-to, always reliable, always delicious,  always friendly Roadrunner. Major mistake. Steiner's is crossed off the list. Let me save you the trouble of finding out for yourself. :( Should have a 0-star option."}
{"text":"Outstanding Menu!!! Do not know if they still serve breakfast at this location. Went in at 5:30am on way to work. Did not see anyone inside for 13 minutes. Finally saw a cook walk by headed toward the back. 15 minutes later unknown female says can I help you? Departed without breakfast!! Food quality has went down hill since Executive Chef Gary Leiser departed. Hopefully, they can improve the food quality and improve staff? Otherwise, they will have a fantastic menu and great location- and no patrons!!"}
{"text":"Best service I have ever had in my life! I like to sit after work and gave a beer while playing some slots. I don't ever expect much from the bartenders considering bartenders are a dime a dozen here however; at Steiner ' s on Cheyenne the girls have been there a while and remember every guest. They also get you a new drink before you finish your first. They are very personable and make you feel like you have a home with them.   After my first time with each bartender they remembered my drink and food order. They are very knowledgeable,  caring and funny. Have a sense of humor and you will love this place!"}
{"text":"The food is great!   Lots of variety in the beer selection, however it sorely needs an update! 10 years ago this would have been an amazing selection.  Outside if that, the atmosphere is good which makes me want to stay. At least one late night bar tender however, is overly opinionated and thinks she is a know it all which makes me want to leave!  The copper tables smell and need to go or be re-coated.  Come on Steiners! Just a little refresher and I'd be here every night!!!"}
{"text":"Went to Steiner's last week and had a blast!  Great service, prices and it was nice to be in a pub that had a lot of friendly people.  I used to frequent 'that other bar down the street' but their service has gone to he**.  Steiners is my new local pub (especially since I live just down the street.)  Keep up the good service!  Kris"}
{"text":"i like this place, but it is a little pricey for bar food. The salads and burgers are all excellent."}
{"text":"Another routine place I go to for lunch/dinners.  They have the best bar food in Vegas hands down! unless there's another bar I don't know about! If there is please let me know!  Back to the review... Steiners have excellent franch fries, rueben, mirage burger, wings to name a few"}
{"text":"cool bar atmosphere.. they usually have beer specials and TVS to watch the games."}
{"text":"We came in late last night. Sat down, and ordered the French dip sandwiches. Fries were the highlight, hot and crispy.  Atmosphere is friendly, lots of televisions to watch your fav sports. Ample parking outside."}
{"text":"LOVE this Steiner's. Death Valley chips are super good and the Cajun pasta is even better the next day. The club is my favorite though. The servers are quick and attentive and usually remember us and our order."}
{"text":"This is a fun local bar. Video poker at the bar, decent drinks and really good food (better than average bar food). I like the big soft pretzel that they serve on happy hour it's very tasty. The chicken fingers are also good (the hot sauce is pretty spicy). They run drawings a lot for prizes when you order certain drinks or beers. Get there early on football days, it's usually packed! The bartenders here are attentive and a lot of fun."}
{"text":"Great bar & good service . Stop in on grave every once in a while ... Always a good time !"}
{"text":"Was a member of Steiner Club Card getting points for dollars when my family would eat there especially on Wednesdays with their $6.00 Hamburger and fries special where a family of. 4 can afford.  But no more they changed their policy that you have to be 21 or older to eat there just so they can allow smoking.  With a 14 and 17 year old we were kicked out last week.  I argued with the owner that he,ll lose family business and he didn,t care.  So the coupons and points I have are now useless and Steiner's advertises in Entertainment.com with a coupon doesn,t state age requirement.   I notified Entertainment.com of Steiner's new policy and they should add age requirement to ad so some families can save gas and go someplace else. They should be boycotted unless you like smoke with your food."}
{"text":"I love pub food and Steiners is my fave by far. I just think the food is excellent. It's a nice neighborhood spot and the staff is excellent. Nothing but good service every time I'm here."}
{"text":"Great food and good atmosphere, watch the game and have good old fashioned American food.  My favorite the Nevada Dip."}
{"text":"Steiner's are wood and brick and comfortable in a manly, man-cave way. They have lots of the requisite offerings of a good bar; many different beers, good cocktails, drink specials, sports contests etc...but it's really about the FOOD!  It's all a notch above just about every bar in town. The fish n chips, fried chicken, burgers, award-winning Chile, salads, sides are all damn good and their breakfast menu is delish and a good deal too! The O'Brien potatoes are sooo good!"}
{"text":"Steiners's staff is the most friendly. They do the best at knowing everyone's drinks AND names which is rare to find. We love coming here. Food is incredible. Best bar food in town. Bartender Maxanne makes the tastiest Bloody Mary, I strongly recommend trying one if she's working. Kimber and Tobin are a couple of our other favorites as well, always good for a nice laugh too. Going to steiners on Cheyenne is nothing short of a great experience. If you haven't been there, you should add it to your list."}
{"text":"Nice neighborhood bar. Friendly staff.  Good bar food. The giant pretzel is delish!  They also have good overnight specials."}
{"text":"Now I am a huge fan of Steiner's as a whole, however a recent experience has caused me not to want to visit the Cheyenne location any longer. Everything was going great into my meal, food was great, waiter and busser were EXCEPTIONAL (kudos to you guys). However about halfway through my meal I witnessed an interaction with an employee and manager. I overheard a conversation that I was baffled to hear coming from the managers end. He was nothing but rude to the employee and used profanity I wouldn't EVER think is okay in a workplace environment, ESPECIALLY from a manager. The poor employee (mind you whom was being \"reprimanded\" for something completely unrelated to work!) then went on to take it on the chin and move about his day unaffected by the abuse. That managers name was Roger Sachs. I cannot support an establishment with such an abusive/rude person in charge."}
{"text":"Used to LOVE the food from here but it's totally changed. I don't know if it's new owners, recipe changes, a new cook, or a combo of things but the food is lousy now.  Also went in had a beer and gambled $40 and the beer wasn't comped and when I said hey I put $40 in the bartender argued with me and tried to tell me that I only put in $10.... I'm very aware of how much money I put in the machine but ok fine. It's supposed to be a locals place and they treat locals shitty.  Treat people better so you can get more regulars. Regulars are where you make your money.  It's sad seeing a place that used to be so great become something that is so blah now."}
{"text":"If you want a place with Great Food, Friendly servers and fair prices, this is the place for you.  Choose between sitting at the bar or in the dinning room.  The food is great.    Make sure to try the German Pretzel.  It comes with 3 dipping sauces.  Honey mustard, Beer cheese and grain mustard.  All are good.  The burgers are very tasty and you can get it cooked the way you want!!!    For a change, try one of the hard ciders that they have.  But if you don't like cider, they have almost what ever beer you want.  Too many to name."}
{"text":"My last 2 visits has been very disappointing. My husband and I use to love and come for lunch and have a few beers, Snakebites are our drink of choice. Lately their beer selection has diminished. To bad you use to be a favorite, unfortunately not anymore."}
{"text":"Went here last night with a group of friends and had the Venetian chicken sandwich. It was pretty awesome but sadly our service was not. They messed up my friends order completely even after coming out of the kitchen 10 minutes after all the rest of our food. And it was a salad...Food did take a while to get to us as well, and the bus boys do take better care of you then the servers, and thats just sad."}
{"text":"First timers. Impressed because we are smokers and it's not smokey! Great atmosphere and nice people. Ordered the big pretzel because the other reviews posted such great things about it but they were out of cheese :-(  Still yummy. Kitchen was really slow.  Even tho a 7 top table ordered prior to us it still took 20mins just to get our one item.  Will return. Food on menu looks good.  Thank u"}
{"text":"I come here on Saturday and Sunday.  Sunday being the busiest day due to the football games.    Mandy, the bartender on shift on Sat and Sun is by far one of the kindest, most hard working, knowledgable and funny bartenders in town.  She's honest and attentive, and she works her butt off!  Her memory for what you like and ordered previously is outstanding!  It's the service I come here for even though the food is good too.  There are several bars in the area to choose from and i come to this one because of the service I get.  She takes care of everyone at the bar with what looks like ease.  She really does make it look easy, but I know she works so hard because it matters to her.  She likes her job and she loves people.  I just wanted to give her the Kudos she deserves and I hope her employer knows how lucky they are to have her here.  You do a great job Mandy, and I know I'm not the only regular customer that thinks so!  Come to this Steiner's, sit at the bar and get great service!"}
{"text":"Nice, cozy, clean bar/restaurant. We stopped here after Super Bowl 50, so things were not the norm. I wanted to try their shrimp scampi, but was told they were not serving that due to Super Bowl festivities, wtf? They were not serving anything from their dinner menu come to think of it.      Since I wasn't getting my shrimp scampi I decided to go with a good old fashioned burger. There were a couple of burgers that sounded appealing, but none like \"Caesars Trojan Burger.\" AKA: The National Championship Burger. It came with roasted poblano chiles, sliced avocado, onions and cheddar cheese. The best part was the chipotle mayo sauce  that comes inside. It has a nice bite to it. I was also impressed by the size of their fries. You can tell they were made fresh to order.        Looking forward to my next visit here so that I can try other items from their menu. It appears to have a great variety of food."}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoy coming here as they have a great happy hour and even better food. I recommend anyone in the area to visit."}
{"text":"Agree with CF. I think the pancakes are made out of rubber found a hair in my french toast one time, No LIE!! The only decent thing I'll eat here is french fries! You are better off going to the KFC across the street which I hate!! I hate KFC and I know it would be better!!  Change Name To:                                   Steiner's-A Terrible Service Style Pub!!"}
{"text":"The only pub I've been to with lamb chops on the menu. The happy hour specials are great too."}
{"text":"This visit was hit and miss.  The service was very good but the food was inconsistent.  The Orleans chicken sandwich was nice, but the Reuben was drowning in mustard.  Even after scraping off what I could, it was overwhelming.  Unfortunate, because in moderation, it would have been pretty good.  I liked the Brew City fries."}
{"text":"Good food and drinks, very reasonable during happy hour, great atmosphere for a neighborhood bar. One of my favorite joints(for happy hour)."}
{"text":"Go there all the time!  The food is always hot, delicious, and served by great workers.  I go there for breakfast and almost always order the Cheyenne.  It is a huge portion that comes with your drink, price is very reasonable.  I especially like the Mirage burger with the fries and never leave hungry!  Wait staff are very friendly..."}
{"text":"Been coming here for year's  and I'm sure many more to come. The staff is AMAZING feels like home as soon as you walk in the door. The food is  Exceptional Never have I had anything but outstanding!!! My  Favorites are this chicken Caesar salad and the Reuben."}
{"text":"We hadn't been here in a long time, but went for dinner last Sunday.  The menu is different from the way it was.  My husband was disappointed to see that his favorite chicken dish was no longer on the menu, which seems to have fewer entrees and more sandwich choices than before.  I was happy to see that the Sunday special was a salad with shrimp and mango, with banana bread croutons, with a \"lemony vinaigrette.\"  It was supposed to be served over field greens, but the waiter said it was no problem to change that to romaine.  So far, so good.  My salad was served with the dressing on the side, the way I'd asked.  But when I started to dig in, I realized that it was also in the salad!  The waiter said it was the kitchen's mistake, but who knows?  I didn't want to wait for another, since we'd waited a long time to be served, so I kept it.  I shouldn't have.  The shrimp were totally overcooked and dried out.  The mango was completely unripe.  And I was halfway through before I realized that the kitchen left off the banana bread croutons, too.  What should have been delicious was a total abomination.  Hubby ordered Chicken Picatta, and he liked it a lot.  It was hubby's birthday (which we'll celebrate in a bigger way next week), so on my way to the ladies' room I asked the waiter to bring him their special dessert at the end:  vanilla ice cream with dark chocolate syrup, and banana bread biscotti.  Mmmm, it sounded good, and they brought it out with a birthday candle ablaze.  I sampled it and realized that those biscotti were probably the basis of the missing croutons, and I wasn't missing anything!  They were inedible. I was already home when I realized that the dark chocolate syrup had been left out, too!    They comped us on the dessert, so I really shouldn't complain, but somebody needs to be drug-testing the kitchen staff.  Just too many lapses for comfort.  If it weren't for the decent service and my husband's enjoyment of his meal, I wouldn't have given this the rating I did."}
{"text":"Place is great!! Wonderful 2 for 1 cocktails for happy hour.  Every beer you can think of on the menu.  Great bar food.  Some of the best i've had."}
{"text":"Called and got a to go order. Ready quick and absolutely good food. \"Better than any bar food I've had\"- both my boyfriend and I   Caesar- actually green, fresh, and tasty  Steak- was better than some fancy restaurants I've been to. Cooked perfectly and full of flavor with mushrooms, butter, and veggies   Chicken fingers- by this time we were so full from our huge steaks so we didn't try them, but they look fresh and tasty  They were out of mashed potatoes, but called us to let us choose something different which is way better than waiting till we picked up   Definitely will be back, especially for late night food."}
{"text":"Great time there my friend heather had a killer club sandwich and i had the kobe sliders on hawaiian rolls. Dam Good. Also our waitress Cory was great, awesome smile and attitude and service..  Thank you"}
{"text":"Steiners has delicious food and is convenient to our house, so we go there every once in awhile. I really enjoy sitting at the party bar (which is like a large table where strangers eat communally) when the company is good. We have always had great service there regardless of fine in or carry out. I have them 3 stars because while their drinks are priced reasonably, I feel their food is slightly overpriced. Every time we get the bill we feel that we didn't eat that much."}
{"text":"Great food. The staff members are incredibly friendly. Happy hour specials are awesome. We eat here at least once a week. The food is really fresh. So far i have loved everything I've eaten here."}
{"text":"This bar is my favorite spot, it's like a modern day Cheers. The food and menu is fantastic, and the bar staff is attentive and friendly. A special shout out to Max and Carlos, so fun!"}
