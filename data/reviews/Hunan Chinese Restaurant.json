{"text":"Best Chinese food in America style, searched on Yalp for Chinese food nearby airport, and this place had good ratings.  Wasn't disappointed with the food and services. Too bad that have to leave next day, otherwise would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Did you ever eat a meal that was so delicious that it really hit the spot? That was my experience here. So very good, I can't wait to eat it again!

The lunch specials here are a good value for your money. You get a choice of two different soups and rices to go along with your meal.

The delicate chicken broth of the won ton soup is so good here. It is pale in color, unlike the bright artificial yellow canned broth used by other Chinese restaurants. I am guessing it is made from scratch. The won tons are just right also in flavor and texture, not tough or chewy. 

The General Tso's Chicken contained generous portions of tender, white meat chicken with a sauce that has a perfect blend of sweet, salt and spice. I don't usually like things too hot and spicy but this is mild enough for me to enjoy while still being hot enough to make me need to have a Kleenex tissue ready for my nose. The vegetables included in this dish are broccoli, mushrooms and carrots.

I chose the white, steamed rice rather than the fried rice because the white rice does not compete with the flavor of the sauce. It also helps to quench some of heat of the sauce if you alternate bites of the chicken and then the rice.

If you are dining inside the restaurant rather than getting it as takeout, be sure to ask for their hot, oolong tea. It is very tasty!"}
{"text":"I have always loved hunans.  So Thur when I was at lunch with my mom, we both wanted to go there.  The place was clean and neat, and the staff is very friendly.  While we were waiting on our order, I couldn't help but overhear them trying to deliver lunch to a trucker parked in a parking lot. Now that's service!!

The egg rolls were great, the general tso was was delicious.  They give large portions.  So my mom has a smaller appetite at 84, and I'm always looking for a way to cut calories.  So we split this dish, And still had some to take home.  I love their crab Rangoon.  They also have a great cashew chicken, and there are daily specials listed on a board as you enter.  Enjoy!!  The food is very good and very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I've totally given up on this place.  

The staggeringly bad choices for Asian food around Moon / Sewickley are just all around.  

Since I live nearby, I hit this place as a default setting.  Kung Pao Chicken ($11) and Shrimp Toast ($7.95).  It adds up in a hurry and by the end of the meal, you wonder, \"Where did it all go?\"  Or if you are feeling a little on the existential side, \"Is that all there is?\"

For the price, the Kung Pao Chicken tastes cheap and rubbery.  On the good side, you get plenty of this cheap and rubbery chicken.  Flavor is just meh.  A bit on the bland side sometimes.

The Shrimp Toast is OK.  Most times I have ordered this, it comes burnt.

Since it's mostly pizza places that deliver to our house, Hunan is the only non-pizza option that delivers.  If I order Kung Pao and Shrimp Toast, I easily get to the $15 minimum delivery threshold.  But, in the end, I should have just driven myself to Leetsdale or Robinson for something better.

On the upside, if you do end up eating inside the restaurant, very nice people work there.  But, the food coming out of that kitchen is just bland, bland, bland."}
{"text":"Our family loves it!  Friendly smiling faces and service.  Always willing to throw in a couple extra fortune cookies for our kids. Add the fried dumplings with peanut sauce to your order."}
{"text":"The food is good and most of the employees are nice but the manager is extremely rude. I used to eat here frequently, until the manager hung up on me mid order then when I went in store to pick up she yelled that she was refusing me service. Like I said the food is good but not good enough to put up with their manager."}
{"text":"Oh my Gosh, the dinner my wife and I just at at Hunan was one of the very best Chinese meals I've ever had! It was the best beef and broccoli ever, and the garlic eggplant was divine. You must eat here."}
{"text":"We ordered from here a few times. The food quality and recipes are inconsistent.   IF YOU GAVE ANY SORT OF ALLERGY DO NOT EAT HERE!!!  We have a mushroom allergy. I always discuss it in person when ordering.  The last two times at least one meal was filled with mushrooms.    Management does not seem to care."}
{"text":"Not good at all.  Got the General Tso Chicken, To much sauce, too sweet, chicken was tough and overdone.  Will never go back and cannot recommend.  Yuk"}
{"text":"Had the Felicity & Prosperity.  The meal itself was good.  It had chicken, scallops & shrimp in a light white sauce.  My complaint is that there was alot of chicken but only 2 scallops & 2 shrimp. It wouldn't have bothered me as much except for the price of $18.95"}
{"text":"Not very authentic Chinese. Chinese restaurants have a certain taste and style that i'm familiar with, and this resto lacks that. It actually seems a bit amateur. The rice isnt asian type rice, and the flavorings are quite bland. My advice to the owners is to get hired in a Chinese resto and learn their secret, because yours are working."}
{"text":"If you've only eaten American Chinese food, you won't know what hit you.  This is the finest, most authentic Chinese food I've eaten outside of Toronto's Chinatown and Hong Kong!"}
{"text":"Close your eyes and imagine you are in a Chinese home where they decided to offer you a seat and make you a meal.

I stopped in since it was close after a 5 hour drive.    The place is small - (approximately 10 tables (which 2 are booths).  I looked at the dinner menu and settled on the Crispy Chicken and Egg Drop Soup.

The Egg Drop Soup was all I like about the soup.    It had a chicken broth base slighlty sweet with strands of egg.   

The crispy chicken was not from a supplier.  Please note bad chinese restaurants use pretty much the same suppliers (your buffet locations) where everything is pre-made and prepared.   This was not the case.  You can tell they take time and use fresh ingredients to prepare your meal.   My chicken consisted of freshly breaded / deep fried tenderloins that were sauteed with broccoli, peppers, onions and covered wtih their hunan sauce.   It was sweet and spicy but not as spice as a General Tso's.

I ordered tea to drink - it was a black tea / not the traditional green tea I normally get.   I recommend this place and will probably return since I will be up here for the next several months.

Service - Great - I can tell they are known for their take out - I think I was the only one sitting in the dining room on a Sunday Evening (or everyone was at the Steelers game)

Food - Very good - everything tasted fresh - no kits here.  My meal was around $12, my soupd was $3

Atmosphere - it was small and very bright for dinner.  The atmosphere is functional - not romantic or lively

I will be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent!  The owners are incredibly friendly and sweet.  The food is always delicious and fresh tasting.  A family favorite!"}
{"text":"The pork fried rice they have here is really good compared to the other place where you can get Chinese food in the area. 
I also love that when I was in the mood for some tofu in black bean sauce which was not in their menu, they still prepared it for me, that was really great! 
Service is great, very friendly. 

After a few take outs from here they already know you."}
{"text":"The best things about Hunan in order: 
1. They have old school hand crank paper towel dispensers in their clean bathrooms.
2. The soy sauce tastes great and is essential to get you through the meal.
3. A cat waves goodbye to you as you bolt out the door.
4. The man who brings plates of hot objects and bowls of liquids smiles a lot--probably because he can't believe your white taste buds can eat such garbage and he hopes you will still leave a tip.
5. The lifesaver mints by the cash register get the taste of Hunan's food out of your mouth.

We ordered hot tea, wonton soup, cream cheese wontons, orange chicken, sesame chicken, and fried rice. The hot tea was extremely dark and powdery--overwhelming and bland at the same time. POWs probably eat better soup than Hunan's hot water in a bowl. The two wontons in each bowl were hard like stale, dried-out meatballs and were literally floating in hot water with a touch of diced scallions. The fried cream cheese wontons were served dry with no sauce and tasted strangely re-frozen and re-fried. The chicken dishes looked the same--freezer-burned stale skinny nuggets with strange breading and unconvincing sauces attempting to stick to them. Neither of us could even get through half of the plates. The best thing about the fried rice was the egg if you picked it out of the flavorless rice. To add insult to injury, the cheapest fortune cookies imaginable were served at the end and I had to spit mine out. I hope that does not bring me seven years of bad luck! I don't think adding more brain-eating MSG would help this place--how do you intensify no flavor at all? At the very least, I have learned to not expect good ethnic food in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. My coworkers and I go here at least once a week for lunch. I get the general tso's chicken every time (you can ask for all white meat for only a dollar more) and it is literally the best I've ever had. It's very rich and savory. It also comes with vegetables, which might sound weird since you're probably used to the random stalk of broccoli that usually accompanies tso. Not here, you get broccoli, mushrooms, carrots, and baby corn in their general tso's. I destroy the vegetables first - they're are so tasty. Their meat is high quality and not like the questionable kind that some Chinese places can be associated with.
All of the soups are very delicious and consistent but I prefer the eggdrop soup. The eggrolls are huge too. Their service is great and the staff is knowledgeable about offering suggestions from the menu. You get your food comically fast and it comes out in a big heaping pile that normal people probably won't be able to finish in one sitting (unless you're me, I've had a lot of training). You definitely get your money's worth here."}
{"text":"Since the usual Chinese takeout is currently recovering from a fire, Shawn and I went with this little gem of a place. The lunch specials are well worth the $8-$10 and are very filling. Each lunch special includes your entire, a choice of steamed or fried rice, and a choice of soup. The portions are very generous. The boss lady ordered an extra egg roll and was thrilled to see that the little fried wonder was overly stuffed and well worth the $2. I want to go eat in at the restaurant and try the first item listed under \"Our Chef Suggests:\" on the menu, a Neptune basket. 

\"Neptune Basket\" a gather of fresh jumbo shrimp, tender scallops, and chicken in a lacy basket made of shredded potatoes. Garden fresh vegetables in a dark sauce are a colorful and taste addition.\" Can you say YUMMY!!! 

Anyway, I had to deduct one star because it did take an hour to get our meal, even though the lady who took out order said 25 minutes. But it was still sooo good!"}
{"text":"Don't eat this. You will waste your money. Is not even closed to Chinese food. I ordered fried rice and sweet and sour chicken. Is the worse food I tried. Two words: really bad."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Hunan.  Within the past year I've ordered delivery at least 10 times and it's always good.  Not sure why some reviews say it isn't consistent.  I usually get 1 of 2 things and it's always the same.  Try the mapo tofu if you are a meat eating fan of tofu, like me."}
{"text":"I ordered the Shrimp and Chinese vegetables last night for delivery. My order was delivered within the predicted time range. The food was fresh, hot and the potion was enormous. I just finished my second portion for dinner this evening and everything was still delicious. I do recommend warming leftovers slowly but thoroughly for best results. Veggies were better tonite as they had absorbed more of the delicious sauce. There's a very tasty ingredient in the sauce that I can't quite put a finger on. The investigation continues. The shrimp were of great size and very tender. This was my first experience with this restaurant. I can happily recommend their food and delivery service."}
{"text":"Hunan's seems to have mixed reviews, and I think I understand why.  Its all about expectations. I was looking for a place to eat a quick lunch that was under $10 and neither fast food nor a chain.  Hunans fits that, and for that reason I am satisfied and have no complaints.

I had cashew chicken. It was fine, and I liked it, but nothing spectacular. The steamed rice was good.  The sweet and sour soup was good.  

 The dining area was clean and quiet."}
{"text":"The food here is fine but it's not worth price. It's regular take out quality food but since they have a dining room want to charge you twice the price. I can't recommend it, the quality does not justify the price."}
{"text":"In my desperation for some decent Chinese food I turned to yelp, which the reviews led me here. I had the general Tso's with tofu, my wife had a vegetable garlic sauce mix. Wife's veggies were old, no real flavor to them. The sauce was gloppy and bland. I'm a sucker for general Tso's tofu, and was disappointed with the sauce. Certainly tasted out of a bottle sweet with no real depth. Just ok at best. The servers were attentive though, and even though the general Tso's tofu was only on the dinner menu they made it for me for lunch. Kind people, with good service. Just don't recommend the food."}
{"text":"I had no expectations of the restaurant when I arrived to place my \"to go\" order. I was warmly greeted by 2 staff members and reviewed the menu. While the menu is not as extensive as some Chinese spots it's certainly more than sufficient for most patrons. 

As I sat at a table I couldn't help but notice the restaurant was incredibly clean...reassuring for a first time customer ordering take-out. My order of chicken with vegetables was available with a minimum wait time. My trip home was less than 5 minutes but once there I found the food very hot and attractive. The staff had packed utensils for my use as they had become aware I was traveling. 

Bottom line: food was very tasty and the portion was plentiful. The \"red\" sauce was a bit different than I have previously experienced but it was tasty and did not overpower the fresh vegetables/chicken. Absolutely no complaints here and, despite this being a takeout experience, I'm giving the restaurant a \"4\" for cleanliness, courteous staff, quantity/taste of entree'. Nest trip I'd like to eat at the restaurant and try the ice cream shop located a couple doors down. Give it a try"}
