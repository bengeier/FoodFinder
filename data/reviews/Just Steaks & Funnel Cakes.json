{"text":"Amazing food and delicious funnel cakes!! For all of those complaining about the price of the funnel cakes if you go to wonderland they are $10.99 plus tax for the funnel cake with ice cream and strawberry sauce. That comes out to $12.45! I loaded my funnel cake with ice cream, sauces, fresh fruit and other toppings and it came out to $13 served 3 of us, and it was much fresher then the stuff they make over at Wonderland. You pay for what you get! I'd rather pay the little extra for fresh oil in the fryer and fresh ingredients! Definitely going again!"}
{"text":"If you're thinking of going to this place just for funnel cake. Look elsewhere. A freshly made 6\" funnel cake is $5.99 and an 8\" funnel cake is $6.99. Sounds pretty good so far, but what about the toppings? Well... go easy on the toppings. You have a lot to choose from, but whatever you add will be reflected in your final total after the weight-in. Yes, in addition to the size of the funnel cake, you will be charged $0.55/oz.

I was fairly conservative with the toppings and my total was approximately $13. Yes, it's freshly made and tastes good if you enjoy funnel cake, but not worth the premium that this place is charging. 

If you ever find yourself near Lakeshore and Cawthra, enjoy the delicious and reasonably priced funnel cake at Dairy Cream."}
{"text":"This is place is heaven!! I went their last weekend and let me tell you I was super impressed. Their steaks melt in your mouth. The baguette was fresh and the toppings are beyond fresh. Then for dessert you go to the other side of the restaurant and indulge in a FUNNEL CAKE!! You no longer have to go to wonderland to get a funnel cake. The funnel cakes blow wonderlands out of the water.
They are crispy light and tasty. The best part is that you go to another section and get to choose from like over 30 different toppings. 
I was very impressed as they continously had someone cleaning around the area of the toppings so it looked stocked and refilled. 

I would give this place 6 stars if I could. Give this place a few more weeks and their will be line ups outside the doors!!!

Great Great Experience I highly recommend"}
{"text":"This place is an ok place to grab a bite to eat. I haven't actually had one if their funnel cakes, but I've had some if their sandwiches and they're pretty good. They have a pretty good steak and rapini sandwich, but I usually go for the wraps. The portion sizes are pretty fair, I doubt you'd still be hungry after eating one of their sandwich combos, if you can finish it. They also have some breakfast options, which look pretty good.

There is seating inside and outside, though there aren't too many inside. It's set up more like a take out place, where you an just take what you order to go. They have umbrellas on the patio, and actually have some tables inside the little mall they're in. 

It's not the cheapest place to get something to eat, but the quality is better than fast food options. Decent."}
{"text":"We settled on two sandwiches. The brisket sandwich (first item on the menu) and the steak, onions plus mushroom sandwich. They were fresh, fresh, fresh. Made with top quality ingredients.

To complete the meal, we ordered a funnel cake to split; surprising it tasted great! Size was not as big as Wonderland's but enough to get your fix on the off season when Wonderland is closed. Too bad they follow the pay by the weight model for toppings but I suppose it's there to control costs."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times. Yes, the funnel cakes are made fresh. Yes they are delicious and yes you pay a premium price.

The owner was very nice to other customers. Chit chatting with them while in line.. Discussing varying topics none of which were about placing an order for funnel cakes. I got to wait patiently, being the next person in line.
In walks a group of young ladies from the plaza and the owner right away sends them free funnel cakes, while I'm still waiting in line..
Am I not a paying customer?

I refuse to play the race card so I will simply state that I will not be returning as I am unhappy with how I was ignored as a customer."}
{"text":"Rumour says that this is the only place to get funnel cakes besides Wonderland?! 

Not only can you order funnel cakes, you can also order burgers/sandwiches with onion rings or fries (combos). The funnel cakes are ordered like froyo - they give you the funnel cake (comes in 2 sizes) and you top it up yourself with choices of frozen yogurt (4 flavours available when I visited) and toppings that you usually find at Yogurty's or Menchies which vary from kit kat bits, almond flakes, caramel syrup, strawberries, peanut brittles, and more. You pay by weight - which isn't much - $2.00 extra on top of the $5.99 funnel cake and my toppings looked like a tiny mountain. 

My prime rib burger combo was also delicious! The patty was piping hot and juicy - the lettuce and tomato also tasted really fresh. The server didn't ask me about the toppings, otherwise I would have asked for no onions.. 

Although it was not busy at all during my visit, the staff here worked hard at keeping the place clean and tidy. They were mopping the floors, scrubbing the grills and wiping the toppings bar constantly while we sat there eating our burgers. It's good to see this establishment has hygienic values. 

Too bad they're located so far, but I will definitely be back for more delicious burgers & funnel cake! They close pretty early (9PM on Fridays & Weekends) and even earlier on weekdays."}
{"text":"As I read the name of this location I had a momentary brain fart as I wondered what they could possibly serve to eat.... I almost wanted to go in and ask if they had pizza, pasta, soup, salads, french fries, and onion. but then I walked in and felt silly as I realized they most certainly did. 

So the don't JUST have Steaks and Funnel Cakes, BUT given the steak sandwich I had this week if the funnel cakes are as good then they do those two items very very well.

Ever the home cook I can appreciate how temperamental a thin cut steak can be when trying to get it to a pink medium rare. And as I took my first few bites I figured \"yep, these guys couldn't do it either,\" but a bite or two later and I found the hot pink center of my steak sandwich. I had the Steak Sandwich with thick cut Pancetta (Italian bacon) and a house made Chipotle mayo. I may have a problem going back to regular bacon after this because pancetta cut thick and cooked on a flat top is un-believable!

My combo came with a complimentary split lentil soup while I waited a pop, AND a heaping pile of freshly made to order Onion Rings. Deadly. I only ate a couple of the rings for taste but holy smokes there was enough there for two people - easily!

The price seems a touch steep for a sandwich but factor in it was a combo and all the extras and $10.95 didn't seem so bad anymore. My only issue was that the bread was a little over toasted and between the chew of the bread and the steak my jaw was exhausted by the end of the meal. 

It's a great spot for lunch located on the outside of the small Woodbridge Mall @ Martingrove and Hwy 7, I'll be back to try their 5oz Kobe Beef steak, it might be pricey at $21.95 but sounds totally worth it!

Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"Very good sandwich.  Had steak with rapini and provolone cheese. The toasted bun really made the sandwich.   We shared rice balls which were also very good.  Service was fantastic.  Funnel cake really good at 5.99.  Did not have any extra toppings on it.   Would recommend for sure and return soon."}
{"text":"Best tasting steak sandwich in the area.  Don't even get me started about the funnel cakes- absolutely delicious.  Friendly and quick service."}
{"text":"Meh, it was ok, just didn't blow me away, and with so many sandwich shops nearby, and several I liked a whole lot better for sandwiches.

Now for funnel cakes that's another story, they are pretty good, and only as expensive as you make it really. The topping prices are on par with other top it yourself ice cream and frozen yogurt places in the area. 

If I were to come back it would strictly be for funnels cakes,and even then it's a little out of the way, and I'd be passing many places with similar offerings to get here. But if your nearby you should drop by for dessert."}
{"text":"This place has caught my eye since it opened a few months back, and I've been meaning to go there ever since. 
Yesterday was the perfect opportunity as they had their official \"Grand Opening\". 
Does this place have steaks a la Keg? Nope. But WHO CARES - their steak sandwich is IN-CRE-DI-BLE. It really does melt in your mouth, as someone below described.
I also sampled their Chicken & Spinach wrap which was also juicy, flavourful and delicious. I tried a rice ball for the first time and was pleasantly surprised.
Now for the piece de resistance - the Funnel Cake. They were only selling the 8\" cakes yesterday, and it was crispy and beautiful. I put some frozen yogurt on, but only a bit because hey...they do weigh by the oz. They have SO many toppings that it was hard to choose what tasty theme I wanted my funnel to have....so I picked a little of everything! They have anything you could ask for ....traditional fruit, these weird juicy balls that explode in your mouth, cheesecake, cookie dough, nuts, sprinkles, reese's peanut butter sauce (o...m...g), hot fudge...I could go on. Is it a little pricey? Sure...but for a once-in-awhile treat? Totally worth it. Definitely worth more than the $12 burnt piece of garbage I had at the Ex this year. 
Now that I know this place lives up to it's name, I will definitely be going back - I urge you to give them a try. 
**Only bummer: cash only. boooo.**"}
{"text":"Funnel Cakes.... 

Just Steaks & Funnel Cakes might be my to go place if I cannot get my hand on one of those in Wonderland....

Made when ordered, the 6 inch ($5.99) is a perfect size for a snack. I like mine plain with just a touch of powder sugar and ice cream (they only have the healthy fro yo). Crispy outside and doughy inside. 

Think about that, I can probably have a 8 inch ($6.99) next time. Yes there is going to be a next time.

I just want Funnel Cakes!"}
