{"text":"Food was really good but the service could be better. Would definitely give the place another shot."}
{"text":"This is a local hang out and not one to pass by if you are in the area for sure. It's under new ownership and much has been done to revamp the menus and beer selection. You will find upwards of 13 local beers on tap for your tasting pleasure, tons of gourmet style burgers, 14 wing sauces to choose from (the wings are big as hell BTW), as well as specials daily that are unique and amazing. I heard Lynn, the new owner, had a Filet steak special last week. That's not the usual type of fair you would find in a local bar like this but that plays to the uniqueness of this place. The wraps look awesome, I'm just not a wrap kind of dude.  The menu is priced right and the service is friendly and on top of it. One warning, you need to get there early if you want a table as it does tend to get busy. That's a good thing though. It says the locals love it and if you are laid back you will too."}
{"text":"Blown away by the quality and freshness of the food at such an unassuming establishment.  Amazing!"}
{"text":"I've been a regular at 49 Yardline for years since it was Pub 49. However, after today I will not go back. We ordered food while sitting at the bar. After at least an hour I asked if they forgot about us. The bartender asked what we ordered then went in the kitchen. He came out with a puzzled look on his face then walked to the other end of the bar and picked up our food. He brought it down to us and said there was a mistake but the other people left and it looks like they didn't touch the food!!!!!!! Are you kidding me????? He then said they could redo it if we didn't want to take these plates...again, are you kidding me???  I said no we want to cash out. It took another 10 minutes for them to void the food off of our order. We paid full price for our drinks - no compensation for our horrible experience...I wish the old owner was back!!!!!"}
{"text":"I used their web page to contact them asking simply if they have wine and what kind.
They post some of the beer brands, so I figured I would just ask.
I got the nastiest response telling me Yes \"how about you go f!@#%^& eat somewhere else\"

Nice Place!"}
{"text":"Stellar food and service every time. There aren't a lot of exceptional restaurants in Harrisburg, but this place is changing that. Mac and cheese burger, reuben, reuben egg rolls, fish and chips, nachos are all delicious. Solid beer selection and great music. Lived here my whole life and never thought Harrisburg would ever have a dive, but it does and it is awesome."}
{"text":"This edition of Excited about Eating takes us back to Harrisburg, NC and to 49 Yardline, a sports grill with great food. Our first experience in Harrisburg was a few weeks ago at Harrisburg Family House Restaurant and we liked it so much, we decided to try another Harrisburg location. 49 Yardline not only carries all of the pub favorites including wings, burgers and fries, but also tacos, ribs, and seafood.

Dora here. Immediately when we walked in, we noticed that 49 Yardline was light and airy, not dark like some pubs, with booths and high tops along with the bar. It seemed to be a neighborhood hangout with plenty of kids and even firefighters stopping by to eat.

For my lunch, I chose the Rib-Zone. Cheerwine-braised ribs, slaw, and my choice of side, English Peas. The ribs were great, tender, full of meat, and sticky from the caramelized Cheerwine sauce. I would describe these ribs as finger-licking-good.

Dora here. Our waiter was helpful with suggestions, and it was tough to choose from so many creative, over-the-top options. Like a PBJ burger. A burger slathered with peanut butter and topped with candied jalapenos. No, I didn't get that one. I opted for a more traditional burger, lol, the Swiss Alps with swiss cheese and mushrooms minus the bun (still watching the carbs). This was a fat burger with great char flavor, pink on the inside just like I ordered. Next time we go back, because I am SURE we'll be back, I'll be looking for the Fish & Chips or the Chicken Dance.

We rate this restaurant 4 forks out of 5 for a family friendly restaurant serving great food. ~Ernie & Dora Hiers, Fiction Faith & Foodies Blog"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! The workers are the best around!! And the food-fantastic!! May not look like much on the outside but neighborhood feel inside! Check it out!! If there's any bad reviews-take with an open mind-some like to over exaggerate  as Mikey used to say \"try it-you'll like it\""}
{"text":"This is mine and my husbands new favorite local spot in Harrisburg. My husband loves craft beer which they always have on tap and we both love good food! At first glance many might think it's just another dive with average bar food but that's just not the case at 49 Yardline! Everything they have is made in house. We have yet to have something we didn't like. The black and bleu salad is my favorite with chicken.  And hands down the BEST wings around, even in Charlotte!! You can't go wrong with anything! (And we are food snobs) You can not go wrong here. Everything is amazing and the staff is always so incredibly nice!! We love Elaine!!!"}
{"text":"The food here is very good! But the prices on the draft beers are quite expensive! The sauces for the wings are delicious and so are the sandwiches. We had fried pickles for an appetizer and those were good as well. We will definitely be back, But for now on we will only be having one or two beers with our meals."}
{"text":"I was so hungry, I forgot to take a picture. We got the appetizer with chicken wings, ribs, poppers, onions rings and corn fritters. The ribs fell of the bone. The chicken wings with SC sauce was delicious! The chef brought us a sample of his potato salad - his own recipe. It is amazing! I highly recommend this restaurant. I hear the burgers are phenomenal. That's next."}
{"text":"Burgers are phenomal. If you have to order one thing here...the PB@J Burger is at the tip of the list. Burgers are cooked to order and the flavor from Peanut Butter and Pepper Jelly make this an outstanding item. Do not be afraid to eat this.... the flavors work!!! That being said... the beer selections and food pairings have kicked this place up a few notches. Best food in Harrisburg."}
{"text":"I've been living in Harrisburg for over 3years now and I'm happy we finally made it here. Friendly atmosphere. Food tastes good. Lots of menu choices. Priced well. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place really surprised me. For a little dive sports bar they have some excellent home made food. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"\"Ruben Egg roll\" and \"4th and 5\" appetizers were fantastic!!! Also the \"baby maker - local IPA\" tasted amazing"}
{"text":"This is a local bar/pub where you can expect bar/pub food!  It has changed names multiple times over the years since I have been a Harrisburg resident, so you may want to check back to see the current name!

There's a bar area, a few booths and tables in the back.  In the back there's also some bar games.  I have been at night and also on a Sunday for football, and it's always a relaxed yet townie crowd.  Sunday was family friendly as we visited with a baby and a child, no issues, and a high chair was available!

If you want some greasy food, a sandwich or burger this is a good spot!  Just don't expect anything super fancy and you won't be disappointed!  Expect beers, food and a relaxed time."}
{"text":"Joint has really gone downhill the last few times we've been there. Burgers severely undercooked, etc. The cooks need REAL training on cook times. Quality has also gone downhill over time. Too bad, it was good at one point. Get it in the end zone and not on the 49 Yard Line!!"}
{"text":"Food was adequate, a bit pricey for the amount and type. Service was good ! Wide selection of beer."}
{"text":"Coming in for the NASCAR experience and yelped this place. The shrimp tacos are amazing! Awesome wings too! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place doesn't look like much from the outside but I swear those are always the best. Try the fried mac and cheese bites with their homemade ranch!"}
{"text":"Great Bambino and club!!!!! Service very good. Quick to deliver food. Must try!!!
We will be back for more!!"}
{"text":"Had a friend recommend trying this place sunce it has a new owner and I haven't been there in a really long time.  This was great pub grub and outstanding service!  Together we had Fried Haddock and the French Dip and both were really good!  Looking forward to going back and trying other things.  It is a bar so expect that atmosphere and the people were friendly!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes going into this meal based off of the positive reviews. It didn't turn out to be very enjoyable. We waited about 25 minutes for our food, which seemed pretty long with how empty the restaurant was at 1:30 in the afternoon. Whatever, no big deal. The music was too loud, though. I really don't need to hear \"milkshake\" by Kelis thundering in my ears while at lunch with my mom.

I noticed a sysco truck unloading outside while we were waiting on our food. Not a great sign, but I figured maybe they get napkins from them or something. When our food came, I realized my boneless wings and fries looked suspiciously familiar. I took a bite and realized they are identical to Chili's boneless wings and fries, which are identical to Applebee's boneless wings and fries. So I know now that the sysco truck was in fact delivering frozen food. It wasn't inedible or anything, but if I wanted frozen food I would go to Walmart and save myself some money.

My mom didn't even eat half of her burger. They forgot to put mayonnaise on it, but did bring some out to her pretty quickly when she asked. She also didn't enjoy her cole slaw. We both thought the onion rings were pretty good. 

By the time we left, there were 4 other tables, and two guys at the bar sipping on beers. There was only one waitress, who was nice, but we didn't get any refills of our water while we were there."}
{"text":"Little ole corner spot in a little ole strip plaza in little ole Harrisburg serving some VERY good and VERY well thought out food. Rueben Eggrolls were excellent, wings were super and the burgers followed suit. Lin has come up with some outrageously topped burgers. Hearty and tasty. Well worth leaving the University area (only a few extra miles) to get away from the same old same old chain joints. Beer selection is awesome and mostly local. Locals supporting locals. Wife and I have decided to have a date night here soon, drink some local brew and go after another Lin  burger creation!"}
{"text":"Excellent food great service...employees go above and beyond to make you visit special"}
{"text":"New name (Hub 49)

Ordered a burger well done. Was in no way well done. All pink. 

Ordered chips with my burger. Straight soggy. 

Water was empty. No waitress to refill.

Waited 30 minutes for waitress to come to our table so we could cash out. Had to go to bar to pay.


Bill was to be separated. Messed up the bills for a separate check.

Horrible food and service! I would give less than 1 star if I could. It's bad when you can cook better food at home."}
{"text":"Laid back, good service, great REAL food! The PB & J burger was fantastic. Best onion rings I've had in years. My wife loved the veggie burger. $2 mimosas topped it all off. Will definitely be back often. They have the best local craft beer selection on tap in the Harrisburg/Concord area."}
{"text":"My husband and I live in Mint Hill and frequent this place.  It's your small town local watering hole with great staff, food and drinks.  We love the small town feel.  Try the nachos and fried pickles to start.  Quesadillas, veggie burger and the bambino are also excellent!"}
