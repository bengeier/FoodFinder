{"text":"I came here with my family of 5. We all absolutely loved our meals! The fried wontons, pho, general thai, and lemongrass chicken were amazing! The customer service was also great, they were very sweet and attentive. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The Pho at this place was below average. I have tried Pho from many different restaurants from here to Hamilton and this place has been the worst I have had. I found the taste very bland.   The service was great, staff friendly, and the atmosphere was enjoyable (the only reason I gave this place 2 stars). I told the wife I would not go back, but I am willing to try the Thai food here and write a different review depending on my experience.  If you're looking for good Pho soup then I suggest going farther west towards/into Toronto."}
{"text":"Delicious vietnamese food and great service. We ordered the fresh grilled beef roll, thai cheese wonton, large special pho and grilled chicken and beef vermicelli. Everything tasted  authentic, fresh and quality-made. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Liked this family restaurant very much, location is tucked away, once you know where to find it you will go back I am sure. Jenny and her Mum were so friendly, we enjoyed chatting for a bit. Pho soup was great, I had the house special. Dumplings were delicious. Vermicelli dish was yummy, the beef so flavourful. Very fresh ingredients and lots of flavour. We like to support the local small businesses and restaurants - this one is worth a try."}
{"text":"Loved the red chicken curry and the mango salad!!  Great service.  Will come back : _)"}
{"text":"This place has great food. Not the greatest Thai place in the area and now that there isn't any Viet to compare to in the area anymore you can say that they are the best Viet place to go to (by default). They do an above average job for both types of cuisines nonetheless. I wish there were a bit more variety in their Pho dishes. I have tried their vermicelli and other Viet plates and they were good. Their Thai plates are good too considering they are not Thai (I don't think). Will definately keep going back. And I recommend this place to anyone. Good lunch specials as well."}
{"text":"This will definitely be my go to Pho place in durham! Probably better than some of the pho places I've been to in Toronto. The food tasted fresh. The broth in my pho was flavorful but not too salty and the flank so very tender. The service was great! They really care about their customers here and made sure we had extra napkins and extra plates as i was sharing my meal with my husband. I'm glad we got there early for dinner because it was packed by the time we were leaving."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise! I was expecting \"fast food\" quality. I just got back from Thailand. I loved every meal every day there. Thai all the way! I also was in Vietnam and I love Vietnamese food. Well, let me tell you, I loved my meal at this restaurant! It tasted exactly like my Thai red and greens curries in Thailand. The flavours really brought me back. The service was amazing. They also deliver for free depending on your location when you spend $25+. pricing is very reasonable. Will be ordering from home next time. Now we are talking about sticking to our plan and moving to Thailand"}
{"text":"REALLY GREASY, oily food in small portions. Ordered Thai fried rice with shrimp and got rice with frozen vegetables and about 3 pieces of chicken... for $12. Pad Thai was also greasy with the teensiest bit of chicken in it. The rest of our order was just grease. The cashier also forgot to give us 10% off for pick up. Mall food court food is better."}
{"text":"Best pho place I'm Whitby so far, taste good , right amount , friendly staff , and quick    Only bad thing about this place  WASHROOM"}
{"text":"Good place. Good food. Had ginger beef and cashew chicken both were tasty. Staff is very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Great pho and great vermicelli. I ordered the beef flank and tripe pho.  It was very flavorful.  The side dish contained lots of fresh basil, lemongrass, lime, and  bean sprouts.  Staff was very friendly.  Plenty of parking. Its kind of tucked away behind a plaza alongside hwy 2 in Whitby. Will return!"}
{"text":"Review for Pho Special.  Appearance: 8/10 Soup: 6/10 Noodles: 5/10 Meats: 4/10 Portion: 9/10  Overall: 6.5/10 Would come again since this is currently the best Pho place in closest to Oshawa."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now, with family and my boyfriend and we had always had an awesome meal. Not only is the food great but the service is wonderful and you really feel at home! There is a vast difference between the family owned vibe when you step foot inside vs your regular chain style restaurant. Everyone is hardworking and makes and effort to make the customer happy.   The beef flank Pho is super flavourful and working downtown Toronto, I can say it's comparable to what you would get at a great Pho place in the city. The Vietnamese spring rolls are also the perfect go to. The rice and grilled meat dishes are great and the portions are plentiful! So glad this gem opened up in the Durham Region."}
{"text":"So happy I found this gem on Yelp! The pho at this joint compares to some of the highly rated spots downtown Toronto. Great flavour, portion size and service. I will return to eat here again and again."}
{"text":"staff is incredibly friendly, food is delicious. they remember our order all the time and it's never a long wait for the food. 10/10 would eat there every week."}
{"text":"Red curry extra spicy was delicious thank you! Menu looks amazing we love Thai. Service was great"}
{"text":"Casual dining with amazing smells! Huge cross selection of Thai and Pho. We had the Surpryz Pad Thai with shrimp, Dim Sum shrimp and spring rolls - delicious :)"}
{"text":"First time here so it is nice that more pho places are opening up in Durham. Cold shrimp roll were made fresh, you can taste the warm shrimp in contrast to the cold veggies. I wished they used some herbs like mint and basil. As for the pho, first point is they included a Thai child which is always nice. The broth was very good and I like the addition of cilantro as a garnish. Noodles were good and there was a good amount of meat. Have to try it again but this is a really good place for pho in Durham.   Update: second time here and still impressed. The broth today was more fatty so it tasted better. Ordered a medium and it was really fulfilling so for the price you get a good portion. I would say size vs price is similar to Toronto. My complaint with other pho places in Durham was the price was expensive versus the portion size but no complaints here. Customer service was also great! My new favourite pho place in Durham."}
{"text":"Ordered shrimp pad Thai and chicken pad Thai. They cannot be called pad Thai. They are noodles buried in tomato sauce. Other people seems to enjoy their rice and pho dishes."}
{"text":"Yum! Yum! Yum! Fabulous, friendly and great food! We came here for lunch on a really cold day and had their phone. My husband had the pho special and I had the pho chicken. They seated us away from the door and brought us tea. We will definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Service is fast and for Durham and surrounding area, the taste is excellent. You don't have that thirsty feeling after eating their food which is good."}
{"text":"Just tried this place and I'm so glad I did! The food was extremely flavourful and the portions were great! The red curry was especially delicious! Also the staff was very kind and friendly. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of different Asian spots and the thing that often sets them apart is the people working there. Pho surprise definitely has nice people working there I really like this family-run business and the food is excellent. check them out you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"In the mood for some Thai food, I had a look at other Thai places in Whitby. Nothing really interested me until I saw this place on Yelp, and I'm glad I did.  I usually drive by this major intersection at Thickson/Hwy2 so when looking for it I was puzzled since I haven't seen this before. It's tucked away in a small strip mall but don't let the look of the place or its location fool you.  This place was packed on a Friday night. The decor is nothing to admire, but with this place it kinda fit.   Ordered the lemongrass veggie soup, lemongrass chicken, and the Thai green curry chicken. All of it was amazing, very flavourful.  The service was good also.  Finally glad to see that a real Thai restaurant has arrived in Whitby."}
{"text":"My family comes here quite regularly. The service is absolutely wonderful! The chefs and waitresses are so nice and greet us with warm welcomes every time we come in. They know our regular order by heart! We will definitely be frequent diners. The deep-fried tofu and Vietnamese spring rolls are to die for! Would certainly recommend!"}
{"text":"It was amazing to find excellent Vietnamese food in Whitby! The rare beef pho was so delicious! The Vietnamese rolls were so good. Everything was great and the prices were more than fair. The service was efficient and friendly. I'll definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Tasty food. Owners are very kind. Big improvement with the change in management. I recommend giving this place a try again. Food is authentic!"}
{"text":"This review is based solely on the service I received which was amazing. The waiter (I forgot to get her name) was very attentive to our group and went above and beyond to take care of a fussy child. The onion rings are amazing! Definitely not average or anything you've tried before when you hear onion rings. We got the small rare beef pho and got the meat well done, which was also very delicious, I would pay for an extra side of beef as I like a lot of meet. I would definitely visit again."}
