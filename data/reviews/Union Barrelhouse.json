{"text":"Horrible uncomfortable chairs, no music, bad service. I only came to meet up for drinks and we all decided on a scale of one to ten, this place is a 4. Not impressed nor will keep this on my radar"}
{"text":"Our table came here for the second time, for dinner on a Saturday night with a groupon. The waitress was pleasant and had lots of tips for us, the beer selection is varied and changes all the time, and the non-beer options are even really good.  The first time I came here I got the steak burger also, and since it was so good, I got it again. Ordered medium, it came out somewhere between medium and medium rare, very juicy and very flavorful. I'm not a fan of carbs so I did bunless, which they were able to successfully pull off.  The bacon jam is amazing, and really makes the burger.  We got a total of 3 steak burgers and 1 normal burger as well as salmon.  All options were really great.  Salad comes with an amazing basil dressing, I dumped it all on the salad and didn't regret a thing.  We also had some truffle fries, and they are pretty dang good too.  My mother didn't like them because she doesn't like flavors, but the rest of us thought the truffle and Parmesan were great touches.  If I had one complaint, $15 for a burger and fries is probably too spendy, even if it is good food. This place isn't going to shake the fact it is a brewpub.  They leave all the doors and windows and garage doors and whatever else open, so it's pretty freezing in there at night, bring a coat in the winter."}
{"text":"Steakhouse burger was amazing! Staff was extremely friendly, you gotta try this place !"}
{"text":"The place is cool I guess. . But the food was awful. They have fancy grilled cheese on the menu which I was excited about because who doesn't like grilled cheese? I ordered the buffalo chicken and blue cheese.  First problem I had when I bit into my sandwich was the crust on the 1/2 inch thick sourdough bread. I had to fight with the thick chewy stuff and about cut the roof of my mouth.   Don't get me wrong I love sourdough bread but not on my grilled cheese I felt like I had to eat the crust off before getting to the inside of my sandwich. Then there was the sogginess of the bread some genius decided to put a coleslaw type salad inside in addition to the buffalo sauce on the chicken and my bread was soggy and gross.... So after pulling that off and dissecting my sandwich.... I figured I would just eat the chicken but there was so much Franks red hot on it it was almost not palatable. And I like hot food but this actually  burned. And then I  was also excited about the truffle fries, but alas they tasted frozen and had absolutely no crunch to them. I was super disappointed. Their beer selection wasn't too bad... And ask for the ambiance and patio there are no different than any other bar in Old Town and we live in Arizona so of course the patio is amazing. I will definitely not be back."}
{"text":"The layout and vibe of the place is great. The beer selection is one of the best I've come across. They have a large selection, but not the largest. It's that they have some really good beers you won't find anywhere else.  The food has been great the two times we've been there, and the service was ok, but very friendly. I look forward to going back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Union barrelhouse could be awesome if their staff and kitchen were consistent. As it stands I've been there five times and the service is either mediocre to bad, or flat out amazing. Last week bartender was awesome. Today unfortunately not so much. The sleeve tattooed bartender was more concerned with her boyfriend than the guests at the bar. Kiss him on your own time please, I'm trying to eat. Only having tried the food twice I have to say I was impressed with the first burger, and disappointed with my second. $15 is WAY TOO EXPENSIVE to pay for a dry bun, and an over cooked, dried out burger. The fries were just thrown on the plate, presentation was horrible. Come on UB, at $15 a burger you have to at least try to dress it up a bit, give me a thrill. For crying out loud Zipps has better burgers and presentation and they are only $8.49!!! UB could be great but until they fix the inconsistencies they will just be mediocre. Never again will I pay gourmet prices for a burger that could be trumped by Jack in the Box."}
{"text":"Giving them 4 Stars based on their beer selection, but didn't try any food.  A pretty Trendy place in Scottsdale with a very elaborate list of brews! We tried a flight and had a mixed drink. Service was a bit slow but the bartender was solo and quite busy. I wasn't really thrilled with anything on my flight, but that's not their fault. I am a bit picky when it comes to beer.  Would I go back? Maybe. Its pretty far from me, and there are just too many other choices.  *****NO FIREARMS ALLOWED*****"}
{"text":"Was planning on having a big birthday celebration here with 15+ people. When we parked in the parking lot and started walking around the front of the bar to meet everyone out there, the owner went to every member of our group and said \"bru haus has their parking over there, why are you parking here? I have to pay rent for these parking spots\" This guy was so rude and oblivious to the idea that we could be going to his place. We just decided to leave. Couldn't even give you a great review because the dude was so rude. Won't ever go there. Way to go."}
{"text":"Awesome beer list, fantastic food. Exceptional, friendly service and kid friendly. We were visiting from Colorado and staying in north Scottsdale but decided to make the trip to old town and it was well worth it. Great patio for the kids to run around and dance. The owner/waiter was extremely helpful at picking out beers that were local and unique and suited our taste preferences. The food was incredible as well. Hand cut fries were a real treat. Give this place a try. Don't pay attention to that crabby Martin guy's review, he sounds like an a**."}
{"text":"Decided to check out Union with friends as they had a great first experience. It took at least 45 minutes to get our food. Both burgers were over cooked - one ordered medium and one ordered medium rare. The burgers were cooked to the point it didn't matter what the meat was any longer. Our service was so slow thought friendly. When we reported our burgers both our server and the manager were prompt to ask how to fix the issue. The patio is great and beer selection delicious. On the way home I looked up their beer menu on my phone to confirm the name and the only menu I couldn't see was.....the beer menu. We don't plan on coming back any time soon."}
{"text":"Best wings in d/t Scottsdale...maybe best in town, (they are for me).  Okay, I'm not a wing purest, I love that they serve them crispy with sauce on the side. I so dislike mushy, wet wings. And then the \"Buffalo\" sauce is so nice and spicy, I'm pretty sure no New Yorker can eat it. Oh, and they have a lot of good beers to go with the wings."}
{"text":"I have nothing but great things to say about this place! I went with my mom and kids and were seated promptly. The server Liz took care of us. She was great. Had great knowledge of the beers that were on tap and was able to suggest one my mother loved! I ordered the BLC and it was amazing! The peppercorn aioli they put on it was on point! The fries came out hot and crisp. My mom ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich and loved it as well. She said the bleu cheese crumbles and slaw made the dish. My son ordered the mac n cheese and tator tots. He loved how cheesy the mac was and that the tator tots were like Tetris. (One of very few times he was allowed to \"play\" with his food) The restaurant itself has an industrial feel to it. It has prohibition style decor which goes perfectly with their craft beer and whiskey theme. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Great addition to the Scottsdale down town. Good beer selection. Looking forward to what they do next. The fresh pretzels are a great compliment to the cold beer!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place a great review because the food is good. To bad the service is unbelievably slow. Had it been busy I would have totally understood but the place was half empty. Took us 30 min to get a menu and that was after we had to ask for one. Then it took over 30 min for water and 15-20 min after that for even a drink order. So once we ordered our drink that was another 20-30 min wait and we didn't get them until one of the people at our table said they were ready for their drink to arrive. Food took 40 min and we ordered apps not even full meals. We were planning on spending the rest of our night there but after that forget it. Too bad they don't realize that bad service is a death sentence for a restaurant in scottsdale"}
{"text":"What a great place here in the midst of all the hype of Scottsdale.  Great beer selection & the food is amaze balls! So glad to find it!"}
{"text":"This place recently opened and we have been there twice and it is great. They have about 35 beers on tap and they keep revolving in new beers several times a week- if not daily. The beer selection is diverse so everyone can find something they like. The food is also very good, I have tried 2 different melts (the all american and the pear, brie and jam) both were excellent, my husband had the hamburger twice and loved it. The bartenders and servers are also very attentive and knowledgable about the menu. We will definitely be back- union barrel house is a much needed brew pub for Scottsdale and you need to check it out ASAP!!!!"}
{"text":"Well, nice to find a great beer joint or is it a food joint? Either way it was awesome. My sandwich was perfect and Nick picked the perfect beer flight for me. Living walking distance makes it even better. I will be back for sure. I recommend everyone give it a shot."}
{"text":"Came here after trying two other local brew restaurants.  Definitely a brew house atmosphere.  Pleased to see the happy hour extends to Sunday's and a small happy hour appetizer menu. Extensive beer menu that is broken down by beer type.  We got a IPA flight (6 different IPA beers) and a Union Barrelhouse Hefe. The flight had a great range of different IPAs while the UB Hefe didn't have much to differentiate itself from other IPAs. I later had the Left Coast Asylum. For an appetizer, we split the garlic Parmesan wings. I was a little upset that the sauce came on the side at first but was pleased at the crispness of the wings.   We dipped them into the sauce giving an amazing flavor.  Definitely some of my favorite wings! We also split the Union Grilled Steak Burger which was actually split in half on two separate plates(kudos to them ) for us. Delicious  burger and cooked exactly as we ordered (medium).  Only thing I'd want more out of is the service.  Would have been great to hear to recommendations or samples offered. Overall they did a great job with taking over Salty Senoritas! Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"It took 15 minutes for a server to greet us without the place being overflowing, the pretzel fondue app came out Luke warm with half melted cheese. Everything felt mediocre. But they have a pretty good selection of beer and other spirits"}
{"text":"We had a Large group for Lunch (The Local Lunch Club) here for a meeting and all I can say was the first time we gave a standing ovation to the chefs.  I had the Buffalo Melt, it is a different take on the old buffalo chicken.  It was crispy spicy and just awesome.  When I asked the other 25 people we had they all raved on their food, so the GM brought out the chefs they were surprised to get the ovation they received.  Now I am a Home Brewer, but no suds at Lunch on a workday for me, So i'm comin back for a burger and brew, the wait staff was also great and attentive.  For the couple reviews who were not so good, they have gotten very good at service and food quality, go back you will also be amazed..."}
{"text":"Clean. Modern. Trendy. Overpriced.  Beer selection is great. Service is good. Food okay  There are plenty of other establishments where  I'd  rather spend my time and money."}
{"text":"Let's start with the fun, open concept! I really dig what they've done with the space and the patio is huge and inviting.  The beer selection is another fun part of the experience. Soo much to choose from and they have a great in depth menu of the latest and greatest beer selections.  Food was just okay. Had a melt type sandwich and could not get over how much bread was served and how much cheese and other toppings were lacking. My boyfriend had a burger and while it started out great and cooked perfectly he then discovered their patties are crumbly and start falling apart after a few bites. Also was cooked inconsistently as it seemed it was just mashed together. My truffle fries were yummy though and my bf really enjoyed the side salad.  Will definitely return to have beers and enjoy the atmosphere. Also will try something else on the menu, can never only give a new place one shot!"}
{"text":"Great beers and ambiance! We had such high hopes for the food after reading the menu, but were disappointed. We ordered the Mussels and Clams in the White Wine Broth-- Not quite sure if there was any white wine in there. It tasted like the Lipton Onion Soup and nothing more. The Liberty Fondue was okay. The balsamic vinaigrette drizzle was a nice touch but the cheese was just warm and hardening. The presentation for Chopped Salad was terrific but, again, it lacked flavor."}
{"text":"I have been here on off times so hard to say, but I have received attentive service each time. Here's what to enjoy: Founder's 2014 Backwoods Bastard! So good!!!! If you like a flavorful beer. Food wise: I liked the wings...so crispy & dry rub tasty!!!"}
{"text":"Decent craft beer selection and frequent rotation.  Nice atmosphere. Tons of TV's playing sports if that is what you're in to.  Food depends on your perspective. If you are looking for average bar food, this will be good enough.  If you are more discriminating about your food, then you will probably find that most everything is inedible.  At our table, the chopped salad was passable, the melts were greasy, undercooked messes.  My wife's veggie burger was one bite and done awful. Worst I've ever tasted.  Regular burger was dry with an overly greasy bun.  The truffle fries were so dry, and the truffle flavor tasted cheap.  Spiked milkshake was average. The menu is creative for bar food but poorly executed.  Service was attentive but a bit spacey. When we mentioned that the uneaten veggie burger was bad, the server apologized but did not offer to take it off the check, which would have been nice, but fine whatever, just a sign of inexperienced and poorly trained service.  All in all I would go back, but only for the atmosphere, the beer, and to try some of their semi-creative cocktails.  I would never order food again, but I admit that have high standards for food."}
{"text":"I give 5 stars for 1 specific reason, our bar back (Chris) who really should of been our bartender. Nice job Chris, Eric give this guy a promotion we'll be back more often for this kind of customer service."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time last night and it was awful for many reasons. Let me say that I worked in restaurants (casual) for years and I am pretty forgiving and easy going. So for this to be a bad review, it has to be pretty bad.   We showed up at 6:30 for happy hour, ordered the gravy fries appetizer (discounted for HH) and some drinks. We ordered the speak cheesy (bloody mary) and a skinny margarita. The skinny marg we got was made with just tequila and water with 3 cubes of melted ice. NO JOKE. Nothing else. No lime, etc..just tequila and water and we were told that \"this is how we make ours.\" The bloody mary comes with a grilled cheese garnish that was dropped at our table without the drink by a helper/food runner?  We ordered our meal about 20 minutes later. Still, our french fry appetizer had not shown up. When we asked our server about it she apologized and said she forgot. Then our meals showed up. My meal was right but the food runner had brought us someone else's meal and just dropped it at the table without making sure it was what we ordered. Had to wait for our server to come by to let her know that we were served the wrong food and only half was correct. Food was ok, nothing special.  THEN..the bill comes and not only did they charge us for the appetizer but they charged us FULL price because it was rung in 40 minutes after we ordered it and it was now after happy hour. So, full price for an appetizer we no longer needed or wanted AND that showed up 40 minutes late AND after we got our meals. At this point we had been there a long time (2 hours) and just paid the bill because it seemed more painful to say something and wait for even longer to get a resolution.   To her credit, our poor server was running like crazy and continually apologizing. The restaurant itself wasn't that busy but she had way too many tables. No one else seemed to be moving at more than a snails pace. It looked like she had more than half, if not all, of the tables in the place. With that, I don't doubt that mistakes were made and we felt bad for her because she was nice and working hard.   Where was the manager? Does this place even have a manager? With things being screwed up left and right, we should have seen one. Not one aspect of this visit was correct or even mediocre. Like other reviewers had said-there are so many good places to eat and not 1 reason to come back to this place. Its a huge, nice looking space that will probably get shut down if they continue at this pace."}
{"text":"Sometimes places try too hard. Went on a Friday afternoon for lunch, and the place was dead... Willing to cut it slack for that though, as it is June in AZ.  I ordered a burger, my wife the Sgt Pepper melt. We both felt the food was sub par. My burger was burned on the outside, and the meat fell apart. Her melt was like meat loaf on bread. She did like the TX toast type bread that was used. Neither the tater tots nor the sea salt fries were particularly impressive. Beer selection was ok, but no more impressive than other craft beer bars around. Pretty standard fare as far as that was concerned. The prices were silly high... $10 for a fancy grilled cheese... Really? The service was ok, as our server was nice. Chairs at the high tables were extremely uncomfortable. Ok to go once, but considering the many options, especially in Old Town Scottsdale, not going again."}
{"text":"The dry-rub wings blew my mind. Great atmosphere, fantastic drink selection, and a great location. Our server also was very entertaining and accommodating."}
{"text":"We checked out Union Barrel House last Friday for a bite before we went to the movies. For being in Old Town, it was pretty low-key, and the atmosphere was great with good music, lots of exposed beams, reclaimed wood, a big fireplace and a big patio that was a little bit quieter than inside. We grabbed a table outside (because it's finally cool enough, woohoo!) and our waiter promptly came to take our drink orders. I had the Aggressive Squirrel, with Bulleit bourbon, luxardo, orange and nut brown ale - it was so delicious, like an old fashioned that had a nice nutty ale added to it. They had nearly 40 beers on tap, all great (I don't think you'll find Coors here) and all $2 off during Happy Hour, which goes from three - seven.  We waited a bit for the waiter to come back to take our food order, and we decided to split the Liberty Fondue and the Pear, Brie and Jam melt, with the Parmesan truffle fries. The fondue and pretzel rolls came out piping hot, and the cheese blend they use is out of this world. The order only comes with three pretzel rolls and an ample amount of cheese, so I might ask for extra rolls next time, or keep the cheese and enjoy it with the fries. Maybe I did that, I don't know. I think the parm truffle fries need their own special sauce - just straight up ketchup kind of kills them.  The melt was pretty good, the cheese was gooey and you can't go wrong with brie, but the bacon jam and the pear could have used a little something salty to compliment the flavors of the sandwich. Overall, we enjoyed our visit, and I think we'll be coming back (they currently have a groupon) to try some of the other dishes with my favorite fall beers. This place is like if the little woody and postino had a baby, and it's darn delicious  - definitely give it a shot!"}
{"text":"The beer selection was extensive, and the burgers were good--my husband said his was great, mine (veggie burger) was average. Truffle Parmesan fries were tasty, too!   Our server was really nice, and suggested some events around town because we are visiting from out of state."}
{"text":"This place has a lot of potential, but certainly misses the mark on food and service. There were 5 of us on a Thursday that arrived at 5:00. Maybe 1/2 a dozen people there having drinks. We ordered our drinks from our server, but there was no bartender in sight. The bartender re-appeared, and starting serving people at the bar as they came in, ignoring our drink order. We waited 15-20 minutes for our drinks. We then ordered food, which took a solid 50 minutes to come. I ordered soup, which I anticipated being there prior to my meal, which was delivered with my meal. My caprese sandwich was I thought going to be grilled- however was cold, and served on cold toast. Our food had sat in the window for at least 20-30 minutes before being delivered to our table, and it was not busy at all. I tried the beer and cheese soup, which tastes like cheese dip that should have been served with pretzels. I took two bites and couldn't stomach it. The waitress told me she would take it off my check, and then didn't!! When I asked about it, she said I ate half so she left it on- I had 2 bites, and SHE TOLD ME SHE WAS TAKING IT OFF! She offered to get her manager \"if it was really an issue\" and at this point I was fed up and done. Terrible food, terrible service, great beer selection, but I will not be back. There are too many good restaurants in Old Town where food is less expensive, served hot, more tasteful, and friendlier service where I can spend my money. And, take note- when someone doesn't eat something because they don't like the flavor, it's customary to remove that item from the bill, no questions asked. Good luck making it past the 6 month mark in this town."}
{"text":"Disappointed by very poor service. On a Sunday night we stumbled upon what on the outside seemed like a good option. With 32 taps and a thoughtful varied menu in a prime Scottsdale location it has a lot going for it. Starting at the bar the bartender struggled to serve the five people but when the rest of our party arrived we moved to a table. Ten minutes later I had to ask for service, and five minutes later an uninterested waitress appeared. Between the the two staff members I was left thinking this was more than incidental and the few patrons there was another clue. I won't be back, there are too many good options near by."}
{"text":"UBH is 100% out of the gate.. Outstanding friendly service, delicious apps, superior beer and wine selection and the sandwiches are great.. try the fondue with fresh pretzels and also the pressed sandwiches.. Happy hour til 7!"}
{"text":"I bring new people here all the time. And they love the food and happy hour prices. Always chill inside. Never so crazy. :) much recommend."}
{"text":"Great place.  Bartenders are super cool.  Kade and Topher give great recommendations.  Loved the beer selection and the even brought a new dish after just the smallest question.  Portions and value are great.  Love the atmosphere too!"}
{"text":"I had a horrific experience at this restaurant.    I went with several friends during happy hour on a Friday and we were seated quickly which was a plus.  The acoustics are very poor due to the open floor plan.  It is pure cacophony.  Expect to yell over each other.  This was a this was the first of many minuses.   Upon being seated it took the staff 10 minutes to bring us water.  It was another 10 minutes before we had first contact with our server.  We said we were not ready and asked for a beer list that we never recieved.  It was another 10 minutes until someone took our drink and food order.  It took another 15 minutes before the drinks came.  I am not exaggerating about the wait, I checked my watch.  This place primarily pours beers, so the bar back-up is hard to justify.   When the drinks finally came, our server spilled a full pint on me.  She apologized profusely.  I was not mad at her, but I was upset with the experience in general.  I actually felt bad for her because it was pretty clear that she was not getting any support from the rest of the staff.  Despite my tables location directly in front of the hostess stand and the obvious disruption caused by the spill, our table was never contacted by a manager.  Our table paid full price for everything, if you were wondering.   The food was mediocre.  The gravy fries were on point.  The fries were crispy and hot.  The gravy was pretty flavorful and had tons of bacon in it.  There was only a hint of the promised cheese curds, which would have made everything better.  However, if i ever come back, I will get the gravy on the side, because the fries got soggy fast.  The wings were large, moist and properly cooked, and they came out with the sauce on the side.  The wings appeared unseasoned.  The sauce was extremely basic; essentially thick tobasco.  Overall, the wings were unremarkable.  The pizza English muffins were unflavorful and had a mushy texture.     Unfortunately, the whole experience lacked warmth.  I would have spoken to the manager about our awful experience, but after the spill  I was focused on leaving as quickly as possible.  I am lucky my phone is waterproof and I really hope the sticky mess cleans off my wallet!  On the upside, the bathrooms and the restaurant generally were clean and pretty well kept."}
{"text":"Pros - Good selection of beers - Ambience & décor on par - Location  Cons - Bad service from bar sitting at the bar (10+ minutes to get to us). Beer glasses remained empty had to ask for more beer, utensils, tab. Then rushed to complete tab because the bartender was leaving... - Printed daily beer menu (not up to date at 2 p.m. on a Sun out of Hef) - Out of ingredients like pretzels for fondue... - No Sunday football ticket & advertised as a \"sports bar\" - Unclean clams/mussels (sand in both) & bitter after taste on the broth.  Just all around bad everything on our visit. Such a bummer because 3 months being open the bugs should be worked out especially for a food group that includes multiple restaurants. Don't waste you time or dollars on this establishment. So, so, so disappointed."}
{"text":"So disappointed,  was here previously and food and drinks were good.  This time food was sub par.  We had the snack in the jar tasted like the costco bar food.  The server said we don't do the seasonings anymore.  The sliders was tasteless.   Now I know why the other places are down the street are busy and packed.  Probably won't return."}
{"text":"We came, we saw benches, never saw a host to seat us even though the signs said wait to be seated, we left and we won't return. No love from this place so no love for it."}
{"text":"Had lunch here twice and both times were ok, pretty good even.  Last night my wife & I went for dinner and was just awful.  Our server took our drink order, then someone else brought it out a few minutes later.  10-15 minutes later, right when we were getting up to leave, our server comes back and asks if we've \"had some time to look over the menu\".  So we stayed and ordered food.  I had to order another beer from another server - ours was AWOL again.  I totally different person brought our good out - burger for me, salad for my wife.  The salad tasted good, but it was super over-dressed.  The burger was ok, but something just wasn't right with it - something was burnt I think... maybe the bacon?  Anyway, I had to go up to the bar to ask for ketchup - the \"truffle\" fries were burnt and barely edible without it - the bartender actually brought me the ketchup...  We didn't see our server again until we flagged him down to get our check.  The place was not busy at all....  I'm never going back."}
{"text":"This place needs to get on their game. They are located where the old Salty Senorita's place is in Old Town, and although it is very different inside, the reputation of shitty service has stayed.   My husband and I have been here two times now, and the first time was a much better experience than the second, but that might be because we knew the bartender, Colby, and he treated us very well. The second time we were ignored for about ten minutes at the bar even though I could count the number of people in the entire restaurant on two hands while watching 3 or 4 servers go back behind the bar and then back to their own section. Not even as much as a \"Hello, has anyone helped you yet?\"  Haven't had the food yet, but heard it was pretty good. Their drinks are a little expensive for that part of old town, but that's just my opinion. Had a good selection of beers though! Although, the glass cleaner was broken, and someone had informed us that it had been broken for over a week already...huge waste of water to just keep it running and not have it fixed right away, and that may have played a part in my opinion. I mean, they haven't even been open for 6 months and there are already problems that are obvious to customers that aren't getting fixed. Wonder what would happen if it was a problem where customers couldn't see, how long would that take to fix?!   Anyways, we will probably go back to try it a third time when we are in the area, but would never intentionally go out of our way to go there."}
{"text":"Great beer selection and atmosphere! Well laid out and food selection is good!  Service was great on a Sunday afternoon!"}
{"text":"(Review for drinks only) Have been here a few times for drinks, location has easy access and ample parking. Staff has always been friendly, bartender was attentive and didn't seem to stray after taking a drink order and the environment was casual but somewhat warm inside. Decided to order bourbon but the bartender at the time wasn't very knowledgeable in this area so I had to give him some assistance. Prices seemed reasonable for the location, craft/draft selection is always great and I'd happily recommend someone to stop in for a drink."}
{"text":"Lots of parking & easy to get to. No root beer on tap. Food is ok, but nothing I would come back for."}
{"text":"I gave this place 3 tries because I really wanted to like it. The first time my boyfriend and I went it reminded me of one of the many breweries in Southern California that we are fond of. Unfortunately, the service was lacking. We sat at the bar during a slow time, but it still took several minutes to get our orders taken, and our water glasses were often empty. When we received the wings, I took a bit out of a particularly thick one and it was clearly underdone. I asked the waitress to bring it to the chef, and she came back, relaying that they said it was because it was \"dark meat\". I'm not an idiot; I know what raw chicken looks like. She took it off our bill though, which was nice.  The second time, it was more of the same. We sat at the bar for quite a long time before getting our drink orders filled, more time for our food orders, and our waters were mostly empty. This was all while watching the three or four managers (all dressed  in ridiculous vests and ties with enormous beards) walk around being busy without being productive. Basically, carrying clean glasses from one shelf to another, talking to each other, and never once turning their attention to the customers sat at the bar right in front of them. After awhile, another bartender took over and she was really great. She talked to us for quite awhile and made us feel welcome and appreciated.   As far as the food, I asked for dressing on the side and yet one of the vested/bearded managers poured it on right in front of me. The salad I ordered also came without the two ingredients I was looking forward to (bacon and seasoned croutons). After several minutes of waiting to get the attention of a manager or bartender, they finally noticed me. However, he seemed like he did not believe me that I was missing the ingredients (you don't know your own food?!?)  Finally, tonight I took advantage of a Groupon. I ordered a burger, my boyfriend ordered the gravy fries. The food took almost an hour to come out. The burger was okay, fries were semi-cold. But the real problem came when I gave the Groupon to our server. She came back with a bill that the 30 dollars had been taken off of, however it was the completely wrong bill. I tried to show the waitress and her idea of \"fixing\" it was to run my card for the original amount (sans Groupon). At this point I was pissed. I had been sitting in this restaurant for almost 2 hours, and wanted to go. When I pointed out her mistake she took the bill back. When I saw her again, instead of bringing me my fixed bill, she was taking the order of the table next to us! Finally, a manager came over who had finally fixed the mistake. He addressed all of his comments to my boyfriend, not me, which pissed me off because I was paying. (At least address both of us if you don't know who's credit card you have in your hand.) After all of this, we weren't even offered anything for our trouble! I honestly couldn't believe it. For a restaurant that obviously views itself as somewhat upscale, its service was completely awful.   Third time was not a charm. I doubt this place will be around for long, especially when there are so many quality restaurants/bars in the area. I will not be back again."}
{"text":"Ask for Ben. He was a phenomenal server. Gave great recommendations, was funny, and very knowledgeable. We started with the pretzel fondue and it was awesome. The pretzels were nice and warm, very chewy (in a good way) and the cheese was delicious. For dinner we ordered the Union Steak Burger with truffle fries and the Caprese Melt with sea salt fries. My husband said the steak burger was \"scrumptious\" and the truffle fries were \"solid\". I enjoyed my Caprese Melt and the fries were great.   I also ordered a Moscow Mule. When he delivered my drink in a traditional low ball glass, I was disappointed at the lack of a copper mug. Ben said to give him a minute and about 10 minutes later, just in time for my second round, he magically had a copper mug. Truth be told, he actually had his mom run down to the restaurant and bring his personal copper mug down for me.   I was blown away by his service and will definitely be back. Thanks for making our night Ben!"}
{"text":"Poor service and average food. The place is supposed to specialise in beer, the staff did not have a clue about the draft beers on offer and when it came it was flat. We was served other people food on 2 occasions and when the food came it was quite average. I can't say I will be going again"}
{"text":"This place has gotten much better since they have been open awhile. Today was my 4th time dining there and it was by far the best experience I have had there. The food, drinks, service and overall experience was much better than on my previous visits.  The patio was wonderful with each table having their own umbrella to provide shade. Also, they have happy hour 7 days a week which is a rarity for old town."}
{"text":"The beer was great and Lisa was an excellent server.  Food was \"eh\" -and our truffle fries (minus the truffles apparently) were cold and over price.  They did not bill us for my salad which I did had not have the problem with our food. They should've wrote off the fries and my aunt's soggy sandwich. If I come back, I will drink the beer and eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Still two stars, but did try the food for the first time. It was an average experience. On Tuesday, they have a Melt and malt for 10 bucks, but that should come with an asterik attached. The Melt is limited to your basic cheese melt and the beer gets picked by the bartender - so much for freedom of choice. Did not go for that option, but instead had the $12 slider entree, which really wasn't too bad in itself. The sliders had american cheese, good onions and a smattering of bacon jam. (got additional but it was too grainy). The sliders came with decent chips, but they were not hot. Someone else had 1/2 a melt (which is a good option) with ham, but she was unimpressed. Beer #29 at 5 bucks on the special beer menu was excellent. Try it if you like lagers."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now .....once by myself ....... and then I brought 4 friends along who had been listening to me rave about it!!!      First off ...... Fries/Cheese Curds/Bourbon Gravy ..... ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!??      A M A Z I N G !   Had it both times!   The choice of \"Melts\" is outstanding ...... and I chose the Caprese with chicken breast ..... yeah you guessed it ...... both times!!       C'mon ....... they're just THAT good!    The home made Pesto will blow you away!!   Chose the salad as your side w creamy Parm/basil ving dressing.   MMmmmm My friends had an assortment of plates that included ...... Wings, Sliders, PBJ, Tom soup and Pretzel sticks with cheese dip.   Everyone was extremely happy!!  Great parking lot at rear helps."}
{"text":"Checked out this new tap house last night with friends, to watch the ASU football game. They have a great beer list, rotating taps, a lot of TVs, good menu and very nice atmosphere. I will definitely go back here as an avid beer drinker."}
{"text":"This establishment is in the building that was Salty Seniorita, but you would never know it. It's totally opened up on the inside, and attractively decorated in an industrial style motif. Some of the tables are held up with kegs as legs!  There are 30 beers on tap, and countless local beers offered. They even have WINE on tap! And, they offer Root Beer on tap for the kids.  The staff is very friendly, and the food is DELICIOUS! The menu has a little bit of everything from burgers, salads, sandwiches and dessert.   There's ample parking on the side and back of the building, which is refreshing for Old Town Scottsdale.  I'm taking a guess that during \"the season\" we won't be able to get a seat at the bar or a table, because it's that good."}
{"text":"The hostess was very upbeat and friendly.....our waitress was very good and made some good recommendations........they certainly have a wide variety of craft beers......sorry to say the food was just ok......."}
{"text":"Came in on a Friday night and it was pretty dead- only two other tables on the patio.  We waited about 15 minutes for someone to come take our drink orders, and the waiter was clueless.  Asked for some beer recommendations (since beer on tap is their \"thing\"), and the waiter admitted he didn't really know what they have and had only been there a few days.  My husband finally just asked for \"anything that is NOT an IPA\", and guess what he got?  An IPA.  If you're going to tout yourself as a \"nano brewery\", the waiters should be trained on what beer you offer!  We planned on ordering dinner there as well, but after looking over the unimpressive, expensive menu, and waiting another 15-20 minutes to get our drinks, we decided waiting on food would be too much of a disaster.  We left disappointed.  Even more disappointing, looking at my bank statement today, it looks like they double charged us for our bill....  Went back the next day (friends were already there so we begrudgingly joined them), and the bartender at the bar was incredible rude.  Didn't acknowledge us at all.  Our friend finally got his attention, after about 10 minutes of standing at the bar (which was not that busy at all), and the bartender waved him off!  I was stunned.  He then got our order wrong.  Definitely last time I will try that place.  Disappointing because they allow dogs on the patio and I was looking forward to bringing the pups there."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and nice patio but below average service and really bad food.  Six of us went here for lunch to try it out and were one of four tables in the place so you would think the service would be good.  While the wait staff was very friendly, the food took about 45 minutes to come out, the french fries were cold (not sure how fries come out cold), items that I requested to be left off my buffalo chicken sandwich were on it and overall the chicken and the sauce just tasted like really bad bar food. When the waiter checked on us the first time he said he would bring back hot fries, however, after waiting another 15-20 minutes they never came so we just decided to take off.  Unfortunately I really wanted to like this place and will come back for maybe just a beer but will definitely not have the food again."}
{"text":"Service is A+. Beer selection is admirable. Party melt is amazing. Grilled cheese with bacon is tasty although the bread was a bit thick.    Here is the rub... Parmesan fries and regular fries were awful.  There is an upcharge for the fries which was ridiculous.    We will return but no fries next time!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to grab a pint before dinner. The place was nearly empty and I could see why. It felt a little bit like a cowboy themed Hooters. We had some floaters in our beer. Seems like they need to clean the taps."}
{"text":"We went to Union Barrelhouse for my boyfriends birthday. Love the building, food and beer was amazing, and our server was so friendly and knowledgable. It is new, so still getting their bearings. Got a groupon, i have two and we can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Loud. Very loud. Good for beer, sports and grill grub. Conversation, not so much.  The beer selection is outstanding. The food is well-prepared and tasty.  The service was a little slow, and I can't figure out why. Wouldn't make a difference, except that the food was already cooling off by the time it got to the table.  That said, our server and the owner were very friendly, and the gravy fries and mac & cheese were VERY flavorful.  I live in Glendale, so don't think I'll be driving cross-Valley to go again, but would recommend it to friends who are in that area anyway if they're looking for a fun place to watch a football game and drink really good beer."}
{"text":"I loved everything about this place! Went on a Sunday to have lunch and watch football, and had a great experience. We were seated quickly by the very friendly and helpful hostess, and we were greeted quickly by our server (forgot his name!) who answered all of our menu and drink questions. The beer selection is huge, and the bloody mary I got was spicy and delicious. We ordered a burger and a sandwich to share, and both were so good. The parmesan fries were my favorite though! We could also see about 5 TVs in our vicinity that all had different football games on, so we were able to watch whatever we wanted. I also loved the indoor/outdoor vibe, and the layout-- you never feel cramped like in a lot of other places. We will definitely be going back because of the fantastic service and amazing food and drinks!"}
{"text":"We are visiting from out of town and our friends took us here wanting to try this new place. It.s really cool inside and the food was awesome! But the service was not good at all.  It took forever for the waiter to take our order and even longer to get our food.  I just got an ice tea but never got a refill. It was not that busy at all, but could not get our waiter to come back. I will go,back there again because the food is so good but I will only go when I have time to kill or are able to wait a long time.  Visiting from Carlsbad, CA"}
{"text":"I came here to eat dinner with my bf. The food was yummy but our service was not the best. We got seated right away and we thought hey this is gonna go fast. Our waitress came asked us what we wanted to drink and brought the drinks right away and told us she was off for the night and our new waitress will be with us. I was like okay whatever i just want food. Our new waitress never showed up and my bf and i decided to move to the bar since we were tired of waiting for her. We order our food with the bartender who was a little friendly and we got our food. Not the best service I've had plus the hostess sat us next to the front door which was annoying."}
{"text":"Union Barrelhouse was one of the best places for beer that I found during my Scottsdale visit.  The selection is seriously off the hook!  So many fantastic choices.  I love that many are local Arizona breweries, things that I can't find at home.  I was able to get a bunch of tasters of things that I have never had.  This is always most important for true beer lovers.  Aside from the great beer selection the restaurant itself if very nice, big, open and modern.  The service was good and the bartender actually knew what he was talking about regarding the beer.  The food was also wonderful, we had the gravy fries and loved them.  I am always happy to see poutine on a menu but am usually disappointing.  Not the case here whatsoever.  These were some of the best I have ever had, I could have them for all meals everyday and I would be happy."}
{"text":"Came for dinner on a Saturday night. Food was okay. Black bean burger was pretty bland. Parmesan truffle Fries would have been amazing if they weren't super soggy and greasy. Yuck. Service was friendly but sparse. Servers ignored us completely despite walking right by us constantly. We had to just call out to any random server walking by to get service. One did comp a beer due to keeping us waiting but I just didn't have a good time being ignored."}
{"text":"Great Scottsdale patio, huge assortment of craft beers, the burger was delicious!  Went for happy hour, Calvin was our server, and he AWESOME!   I would come back just to see him!    This was probably my 4th or 5th time here, always good.  Best servers in Old Town!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Waitress came back twice to tell us they were out of one of the dinner selections then to tell us they were out of the type of wine my wife was drinking. The orders took over an hour to serve. We waited at least15 minutes every time we reordered drinks. A salad that was ordered with chicken did not have the chicken and that took over 15 minutes to bring. We ordered chicken wings to start and they were never served. They do have a great beer selection so were disappointed it was as terrible as it was."}
{"text":"Hostess was very nice, but it took 20mins for Mac and cheese with hot dogs. Mind you it was a good starter :) (small but good!) It took 15 mins to get a replacement beer, but it took over 25mins for our entrees! They were burgers!!! And the restaurant was empty and the kitchen was full (4-5 cooks!) Server barely checked on us. Beer selection was good, but if you have to wait that long, not worth it!!!... Overall, won't come back!!!"}
{"text":"We stopped by one afternoon to grab a drink at the bar.  The atmosphere is both lively and fun inside and out, the bartenders are nice and the drink list is extensive.  Looks like a great place to watch a game and grab a beer on the weekend!"}
{"text":"Frist time and loved it, food and beer was awesome, music was way too loud"}
{"text":"Great spot for lunch, dinner or drinks. The beer selection runs the gamete and April is the best bartender in town. Try the express lunch combos, all cooked and smoked in house."}
{"text":"I guess I had seen this place when I had driven by before...but like most things on Scottsdale Rd, it didn't catch my eye. Then I saw a groupon and was like huh....they serve food?  Why YES! YES THEY DO!!!! And amazing food at that! My friend and I went in for a late dinner, we got the fondue for an appy and then split the Pear/Brie Sandwich and got the soup (Roasted Tomato Basil) All of it was AH-MAZE-ING!!!!!!!!!!! the portions were HUGE! sharing a sandwich and getting a soup is more than one person can eat, and the service was awesome! We were greeted but this completely adorable upbeat hostess who quickly seated us...and then within a couple minutes our server Adam came over! If you go here HOPE he is there! He was attentive, funny and sweet and just made this place all the better!  can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance here! Gives off laid-back, hipster type vibe. We sat on the large deck outside. Great beer selections with some options being from Union Barrelhouse brewery. I particularly enjoyed the Union Barrelhouse Hefe. The food was all great too. The waffle battered chicken sandwich is a must try!"}
{"text":"Oh my that steak burger is great! Given places I've lived/dined did not think I'd find glory in AZ on biz trip. 36 beer tap list cherry on top. Great service provided too as solo traveler not always provided.I'll stay nearby again just to end my day here."}
{"text":"Great venue, nice staff. The steak burger was tasty but we've had tastier. I'd say the best thing about this place was the beer."}
{"text":"Chris the barback... he is AWESOME. SO friendly and personable. He would be an amazing bartender, just saying. Love this place!!!   P.s. If you don't particularly care for IPAs, try the #26 beer. Try it, and FALL IN LOVE.   XOXOXOXO"}
{"text":"A refreshing upgrade from the owners of Salty Senorita's. Each visit here has been an enjoyable one for a couple reasons:  * Great drink selection. There's a wide array of beers and cocktail, with a couple creative options thrown into the mix. One of my favorites is the quick-like-ninja-ale. It's a pilsner and cold sake mix. Kind of like a fancier sake bomb that you sip on. Not a beer or spirits fan? They've got an assortment of fine wines for most every palate.    * Patio seating. It's a great place to hang out on a nice evening or during a day drinking excursion. I like it because it's close enough to old town, but sort of off-strip. That cuts down on high foot traffic, which means less competition for tables. May not be great for their bottom line though...  I haven't tried much of their food, so I won't speak on that too much. However, I did find their liberty fondue (three cheese with soft pretzels) to be pretty good. On my birthday, I was given a free shot, so that was a plus. Overall, Union Barrelhouse is worth giving a chance if you're in the mood for a cold drink and picking off a tasty looking food menu."}
{"text":"We came here for the first time the other night and the atmosphere blows you away! The interior has an industrial feel to it with exposed pipes in the ceiling (so cool!) and awesome seating. There are a few options: long tables with bench seating (great for large groups), high tops with cool chairs, bar seating (same chairs), and booths that look REALLY comfortable. I can't imagine anyone not liking this space. Moving on to the drinks... wow what a selection! We love locally brewed beer and they have so much of it! They also support craft beers from all over the nation (we generally stay away from domestics and prefer trying new beer when we go out). The server was very knowledgeable about the beer and helped me pick one out that I would like based on my known preferences. I had a hef, can't remember the name, but it was crisp and refreshing. The food was also really good. We went during happy hour which includes $2 off appetizers. We shared the pretzel and cheese fondue (really tasty! the pretzel bread was warm and delicious, so fresh! and the cheese was sharper than what you usually get, something we really enjoyed), the mussels and clams with a butter sauce- this was really good too, although we thought the sauce could use more lemon, maybe more garlic, and if they charred the bread a bit it would add more flavor- but we still liked it and ate it all! We also had the mignonettes (tiny filet mignons on crostini with blue cheese, pesto and a creamy horseradish sauce/dressing) SO AMAZING! By far my favorite of the food we tried! The manager stopped by to see how we were enjoying, always something I appreciate about an establishment. Of course we had no complaints, this place is GREAT!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go.  Sadly it closed a couple weeks ago. A BBQ place owned by the Brat House next door will be going in there."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, food, and craft brews! If you're in the old town Scottsdale area it's worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Love Union barrel house! I have gone here twice for lunch and the food and service has always been great!"}
{"text":"Delicious, delicious, delicious. The food, the beer, the band- great!!! Service is a little slow, but not worth sacrificing a star. I went 2 days in a row and I live 25 miles away!! The liberty fondue is super tasty if a little misnamed. The cheese is not fully melted, but the taste is divine. Think a gooey cheese spread for texture. The pretzel sticks are served PIPING HOT (and delicious). I had the Brie, Pear and Bacon jam sandwich one day, my husband the Mac n Cheese, and the other day (while solo for brunch) I had the waffle battered chicken sandwich.   The great- the Waffle battered Chicken sandwich. Holy mouth-watering greatness!  Served with crispy average tater tots. Just go ahead and dump the honey on the sandwich, it takes it to the next level.  The Pear, Brie, Tomato/Bacon jam sandwich was pretty damn epic. Wonderful flavor and great texture.  The average but still nice- the tater tots and truffle - parm fries. Truffle parm fries are the new hipster kale. I'm all truffle fried out at this point.  The \"Did they forget salt?\" Moment- The mac n cheese was pretty bland. The cheese flavor was really light and there was no other seasoning. I have to assume this was a mis-step and not a regular occurrence.   Give it a go, you will definitely love it."}
{"text":"Pretty decent happy hour. $2 off drafts and $5 wells. One of the best places in old town to get a good draft beer, great selection."}
{"text":"Had a great night at Union Barrel House. The staff was extremely friendly and great! The food was good and reasonably priced. I will returning soon."}
{"text":"Improving!  They now have belgian style beers rotating on draft, yay!!  Menu is still pretty meat-forward, but there are options for making certain dishes vegetarian and even vegan. You just have to ask.  =)  Happy hour pricing here is great and its errry day from 3-7pm!!  Beware: They regularly change the items in the jar of Bar Snacks... If you have allergies, ask for clarification!! I'm lucky my friend noticed the pecans in the mix before I ate something and had an allergic reaction (the menu says almonds =/ ).   The server was kind enough to take it off our bill, and now I'm aware for next time.  I haven't been for brunch, but it should be noted they have bottomless bloody marys and mimosas with a meal, I believe it was $12."}
{"text":"Tried it again - will not be back.  Took my brother & sister-in-law to this restaurant for a birthday lunch.  We arrived at 11:30 and did not get our lunch until well after Noon. Both of my family members had to get back to work. The server never refilled our ice tea and never checked on the table. While we were eating on the patio - they started painting right next to our table.  I did not write a review at the time (early Feb) and I went back last night before making my decision.  Silverware was dirty but the service was much better. I told our waitress about the previous experience and she listened politely but did not take my name or number (or notes) as I asked to have the information given to the manager.  Food is just OK and with so many restaurants to chose from in the Scottsdale area, this place is now off the list of four local residents."}
{"text":"Love the decor...... the service, food and professionalism, not so much.  There was only 6 or 7 people in the whole place while we were there.  We sat for about five minutes before a server arrived.  We ordered  a beer and a wine then a couple of the \"melts\".  I ordered mine with no onions, I can't eat food that has been touched with onions.  It arrived with onions.  My server was cleaning booth seats and never noticed me sitting with my plate pushed forward.  After a few minutes a manager came by and took the plate.  While I waited for my food I ordered another wine.  The waiter eventually came and told me the wine was not in stock.   I ordered another. which was also out of stock, but it also took a while to figure that out.  My food came back and while the sandwich was tasty the exterior had an abundance of grease, as did my husbands.    We were ready to go but no one came to the table because the manager had decided to have a staff meeting directly in front of our table.  He even glanced over at us, obviously done and still no one came.  So although the place has a nice atmosphere, parking and premise, it will not be a go to for us, even though we eat out 5 nights a week and live in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Came on the 'grand opening' night. Cool band and a busy buzz. The food is great for an old town sports bar-ish hangout spot. Had the wings which were crispy with an awesome home made type wing sauce. Also had the 'blc' melt. Had a super flavorful peppercorn aioli and plenty of bacon on it. The only issue was they ran out of fries and gave me roasted beets :/ they were really good tho. They make their own dressings and service is on point. Definitely will be back even tho I live downtown! Thanks to Colby for knowing his stuff."}
{"text":"Union barrel is a nice spacious sports bar.  The patio is a great addition.  The food was nothing special, i ordered without butter but it came with butter, no big deal but I will say the service was good and the manager went around to each table."}
{"text":"SO MANY BEERS!  I love this place... I love this place has a HUGE parking lot since parking for other restaurants in the area is hard to find. They have an amazing \"shaken\" salad that is shaken table-side in a MASON JAR! Their happy hour is great too!"}
{"text":"Good appetizers.  Wings are good, with nice spice dry rub,  and I believe a Frank's Red Hot Sauce based dipping sauce. Pretzel sticks with dipping fondue. The steak is good and was cooked as ordered. French fries could use a little work. The kids mac and cheese looked like Kraft boxed mac and cheese,  the menu stated it was spiral pasta, it wasn't, please fix the menu. Nice draft selection, they do flights of beer,nice! Only 3 beers UBH beers, though....but they feature other Arizona craft brews."}
{"text":"Came here for their Grand Opening. It's a very cool space, very farmhouse/contemporary/hipster/trendy. Exposed ventilation, butcher block counters, shared tables. Large patio out front (the same patio as the old Salty's just a little re-do).  The beers on tap are phenomenal. The list is tremendous, but they do a great job of explaining alcohol content and where the beer is brewed. Although I didn't try any, they have beer mixers (custom mixes of beers...like a Rattlesnake or Black and Tan, but with many more options). Their focus seems to be on getting more out of beer than the standard craft beer options. They also offer wine and cocktails.  The food we ordered was ok. Grand opening means very slow food service. Drinks were fast, food was not. I ordered the vegetarian black bean burger and although it was fine, i probably wouldn't order it again. Very dry and the Hawaiian style bun was way too much bread for the amount of burger. It came with a side of fries. My wife and her sister both ordered the salad options. My wife ordered with dressing on the side but of course the salad came drenched in salad dressing anyway. They both were unimpressed, saying they could've made these salads at home with the ingredients we had at the house.  Ultimately, the atmosphere and vibe pushed this to 3 stars. The crowd felt less \"power drinker\" and more \"appreciative beer drinker\", which is a nice change for old town."}
{"text":"We came here to enjoy a night out. The place is very large and with the weather being cooler we took a seat out on the patio. The waiter for our table never showed so another took over our table. Over the night the service was pretty slow considering that it wasn't that busy and many times we finished our drinks and had to wait quite a bit before our waiter would come around again. However, I really enjoyed my food. The dry rub on the wings was very spicy, just the way I like my wings. Then I had the union grilled burger. Very tasty, but a little messy with the amount of BBQ sauce on it and the side of fries were good. My husband had one of the melts, was disappointed that it had minimal cheese and too much bread. They have a great list of beers and we enjoyed all that we ordered."}
{"text":"Honestly, everything about this place was perfect to me. Coming from Cali expectations are pretty high and this place did not disappoint. Which honestly is very refreshing. Our bartender was Kelton, very professional and friendly. I ordered the Black bean Veg burger and hands down the best I've ever had! Super moist and for sure the flavor was awesome. Would honestly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Great location! Visited the UB on a Friday, and had excellent service, and a decent experience. Ordered the gravy fries, the bbq burger and the fresh beet salad. Gravy fries were awesome...Burger was decent, but next time I would recommend ordering the beet salad w the dressing on the side- it was drenched in their balsamic. I would come here again for the atmosphere, but not for a dinner experience."}
{"text":"Great attempt at good food ruined by smug bartenders.... Should be name of this place..  3rd time here met with same attitude..."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic but I doubt I ever come back, which is a shame. I've been here twice in one week with the same experience. Owner needs to pay more attention to customer service. Both Saturday afternoon and tonight (neither date was busy) we waited for 5 minutes or more for a hostess. She never showed. Both times I had to venture into food running area to fetch someone. What is worse is waitstaff and bartender saw us both times and didn't bother to tell anyone. The manager seems to not really care what is going on with the front of the house as both times he was there and didn't seem to notice. The first time, I also had to flag down our waiter to get a drink order/water started. At least this time we actually had a waiter that was great! Kylie is phenomenal! She made the second visit bearable. It's too bad--the food is good but is ruined by the lack of caring by the people that work (other than Kylie)."}
{"text":"My overall experience here was not good.  I came for the first time a couple of weeks ago with a group of 8 on a Friday night. Service was bad. We ordered items that never came, received food we never ordered (and still had to pay for it), and were out of water more often than not. When we complained, the server blamed the setup of the restaurant as being \"too confusing\". We asked to speak to a manager but that didn't come either.  The food was average. It reminded me of something you get in an airport (think fast and cheap). We ordered several plates of the barrel top pizzas which lacked flavor. I had a sandwich but I couldn't tell you which one because the server brought me the wrong item and then wasn't able to identify it after. She actually said to me, \"whatever it is, I hope you enjoy it!\" That was a first. The sandwich itself again lacked flavor. Some of my friends got wings. They all pretty much agreed that they would not order them again.  The noise was awful. I could barely hear the person next to me. This really ruined the experience for me if the service wasn't enough.  The only reason this places gets a second star is because of the decor and location which are both great. I think this place will fail unless it can correct the issues with the service staff and improve their menu items."}
{"text":"I'm liking this place right now.  Been there about 3 times in the last month.  It's much busier when football is on as Old Town is starving for more places to watch the games.  They have a bloody mary special on Saturdays (maybe Sundays too?) that has a mini grilled cheese on top...seriously....grilled cheese..that's amazing.   The melts are good, the variety and changing beers on top make it fun and interesting each time you come in.    Servers are non memorable so far, but the greeter is super friendly and makes you feel welcome.    They need to add more appetizer options to the menu.  When groups are drinking and snacking, they would sell more apps with more options."}
{"text":"I hovered between 2 and 3 stars and finally settled on 2 stars cause well, no one likes to feel ignored and brushed off!!! It was the grand opening party for Union Barrelhouse and the place was hopping!!!  A fantastic sign for any opening of a restaurant!!!  My son and I were greeted warmly at the door and being Yelpers, were presented with a gift bag at the door (thanks!)  then we sampled their grilled chicken with mozzarella, tomato, basil sandwich which was delish.  We got there at 7pm, they must have had an opening for VIP guests cause even though the event invite said 7pm till close, when we got there a little before 7pm, 95% of the complimentary sampling were gone.   NO BIG DEAL- we werent' there just for the free food, we came to support this restaurant (must be the same owner as Salty Senorita) so after we greeted fellow Yelpers Irene V., Laura I, Travis B., and the gang, my son and I looked for a patio table cause we wanted to sit down and have dinner.  Zzzzzz as in the place was buzzing but our waitress was not to be found.  Finally I accosted one and she told me she would be right with me . . . 15 mins later . . . no big deal- there was soccer on tv so we watched the game . . . when she came, we ordered our food- kid's meal chicken tenders with fruit and a farm market salad . . . easy pizy order. Then we waited and waited- my son who was very hungry kept asking where the food was . . . I accosted my waitress and asked- she said it would be right up. (As in, palm in face- don't talk to me, can't you see I'm busy??)  I was understanding- I mean, the place was packed!!! We waited sooooo long that in between waiting my son had time to enter a grilled cheese eating contest where he had 5 minutes to eat 9 grilled cheese sandwiches (which by the way, was very fun)- I don't know how long the contest took- 30 mins?   By the time we got back to our table, our food was still not ready!!!  10 mins later the food comes, the waitress hurriedly throws the food down on the table and just runs away . . . I didn't even get the chance to tell her she gave my son tater tots instead of the fresh fruit side he ordered.  Finally I had to chase her down and accost her again and she said, \"oops, I'll bring it right out . . . \" 30 mins later we were still waiting!!!  My son kept asking where his fresh fruit was. Finally I chased her down and accosted her AGAIN and this time I asked her to talk to the manager to comp'd our meal for the evening. This is the first time ever in my prolific string of dining experiences where I had to consistently chase down the server- I might have logged a 1/4 of a mile chasing her down!!!  You get the picture. The manager came and was very friendly and apologetic and willingly comp'd our meal.   In terms of pricing, it was $10 for my salad which was medium sized portion, fresh, loved the balsamic vinegarette reduction but I thought it was a bit pricey for the portion and atmosphere of the place.  The chicken tender kid's meal pretty ordinary- nothing to write home about. Atmosphere is great, food ordered okay, service received epic fail.  Manager very understanding and friendly.  Not sure I would come back again."}
{"text":"We came here to watch Monday night football. The television set up is good. The bar chairs are extra comfortable, as is the atmosphere.  Cool industrial decor and a nice music mix at a volume that you can still hold a conversation.  The service was very friendly and accommodating. We tried a number of beers, both as little tastes and a flight. They offer a great, constantly changing beer selection.   The salmon was perfectly cooked to medium rare, at our request. We also enjoyed the mussels appetizer and a side of beets."}
{"text":"I give them high marks for nice layout, great beer selection and a good patio. The dry rub chicken wings are a nice change from the \"wet\" ones.  Good tv's for catching up on sports.  Happy Hour (3-6) is a good deal for the beer drinkers, but if your wife likes wine, it is full price.  Overall, A lot of potential. We will see."}
{"text":"I rarely review because most places fall in between 2-4 stars so in not adding much influence. This was a five star afternoon for me and my Mum. The beer selection was excellent but not so large that there might be a stale keg. They also have Ninkasi!!! Big ups for that. Started with the meat and cheese board which was so good a great quality items. The wings were crispy and gold. The sauce was on the side which is good for how slow I eat and how I like to sip my beer. I was already full but we decided to split the sliders. These are not regular sliders. They were not the best I've ever had but near! The beef was cooked perfectly and the balance of the cheese and the texture/mild sweetness of the onions made two more Ninkasi beers disappear. The service was perfect (Claire I think?). Not too buggy but we were not left without a beer or water etc.  This is a great spot. I could def party with friends here in the evening or do lunch as I did. I will definitely return when back from SD."}
{"text":"The only reason im giving it 1 star is the service... We are absolutely in love with the mornin missle shake, we specifically come to UB for this magical shake, but tonight we received horrible service, Meredith, our bartender not only half greeted us, she just plainly ignored us, she took away our drink menus before we finished the drinks, and didnt even ask us if we needed more drinks, never checked on us once more, not one smile, we just didnt feel welcomed there. It actually made us feel uncomfortable just asking for our drink. If you re new to the job we understand you may not be fully comfortable with the drinks but customer service makes a large difference. The place is actually pretty cool, drink menu is solid, ambience is relaxed and the shakes are amazing."}
{"text":"Great patio, great beer selection and decent food...when they get it right. This place really has potential to be awesome, but it's new, and they clearly haven't worked out the kinks yet.  My office is right near old town, so we've gone to Union Barrelhouse for both lunch and happy hour. For happy hour, it's great because we're never in a hurry. For lunch on the other hand, they have some work to do.  Last time we visited for lunch, the food took forever. The server was really nice, but forgot one of my co-workers orders and didn't realize until we were already waiting for 15-20 minutes. When the food arrived (we all got different melts), it was hit or miss. My buffalo melt didn't even seem to have cheese on it (it was really missing the \"melt\" component). Another co-workers wasn't even melted -- it was literally a cold sandwich. She had to send it back and take it to go because we had already been there for over an hour.  I'm really hoping this place can pull it together because I really want to like it!"}
{"text":"This is a great new place near downtown! They have an awesome and HUGE draft beer selection that is ever changing, making each visit a new adventure of beer (be daring and step outside your comfort zone!) The food is also awesome and not your typical bar cuisine, and the interior is super hip and well done. Only bummer is I am not to the point where I'm drinking alone, with no one to talk to and the music is a little too loud for socializing. So there's that. But if you're a bar fly only sitting at the bar top alone, you shouldn't have any complaints. :)"}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Great beers. The wings, fig and pear grilled cheese and the truffle fries were all 10/10."}
{"text":"Must try! Their truffle Caesar salad is to die for! Also the shaken salads DELISH! Yummy b-fest & lunch. Great bloodys!"}
{"text":"Not good, overall just not good. We had a large group and our poor server seemed so overwhelmed. She actually did a good job getting everyone's orders but then who knows what happened in the kitchen. Half the table never got any food at all, some of us decided not even to order entrees because it took so long for anything to come out. I did get to eat the gravy fries which were actually very tasty. A little too much salt but still liked it. The Mac n cheese was side order size and something I could have made myself. It was decent but nothing to get excited about so whoever wrote the menu is just really good about describing things in a fanciful way.   Now the chicken tenders. I heard the waitress telling someone else that they were so popular they made an adult version. I love chicken tenders so I ordered them. It was like cardboard microwaved chicken. Took 2 bites and sent it back. I was in shock. Chicken tenders are usually so good to me because of the different ways that restaurants bread and fry em up. The tots were like what you get at elementary school lunch. I'm sorry union but for kids maybe okay, the only adults who would eat that are ones who are too drunk to notice what you just put in front of them.   Location and decor is great. Figure out your kitchen timing, revisit some of the menu items and this place could be really successful."}
{"text":"We usually have wonderful food for brunch  so we decided to take the in laws here for dinner.  What a mistake! The beer selection is awesome but the food was disappointing. My husband was so ill for days (something was wrong with the salad dressing), the wings were over-salted, the classic grill cheese was hard as a brick and required too much chewing (jaw breaker), the black bean burger looked and tasted like it was a frozen, store b ought patty and lastly the Mac and cheese was the only dish that was up to par. The service was excellent, though. Our waiter was kind and prompt."}
{"text":"Great place for an afternoon drink and food. Great selection of beers and great bartenders who know there stuff.   Steak burger is awesome and the cheese fries were delish. Did have and iffy waitress in the evening but there bartenders at the bar were great."}
{"text":"Bye Salty's and hello Union Barrel House. If you keep up on my reviews, I was devastated by the loss of old Salty's, with the $5 Happy Hour meals and buckets of Corona. Well, you won't get that here, either. This is more of Postino's meets Panini. Totally made over with a nice industrial feel. They specialize in burgers and melts. I did not try a burger. The melts are sizable, stacked and sided with fries. They have something for everyone.   They have several salads. We tried the romaine hearts. Topped with Parmesan and croutons made of pretzels. Tasted great but not going to fill up even an skinny chick. Melts were king here, no doubt, and everyone finished them off with little left and no complaints.   Multiple veggie options including veggie melts which were really good.  Beer selection is magnificent.  Service was so friendly and eager to please I felt like I was in beer Disney World. Amen to the hiring manager. Staff is well dressed and not so rushed that they ignore you. The place is pretty upscale, can be a great dressy date night or a kinda casual night out with friends.   Oh, and of course we tried the wings. They are dry rub wings, with celery-carrot slaw and blue cheese crumbles. At first I raised an eyebrow with this \"trendy\" wing method. But they came with a side of tangy buffalo to dip into if the spicy dry rub was not enough. The slaw rocked and the blue cheese crumbles went. It all went. This may become a new go-to destination when visitors come to town."}
{"text":"This review is a collaborated review of my two co-workers and I.  We stopped in here for lunch today and we all agreed that our first impression was more than likely going to be our last.  We got there at 11:30 trying to beat the noon lunch rush that happens on a daily basis in Old Town and surrounding area's and an hour and half later we were finally heading back to the office with nothing to say to each other but silly things about how aweful our experience just ended up being.  It's unfortunate, this place has a lot of potential.  I told them I'm going back, and they all laughed.    I'll save my politics on how YELP needs to seriously upgrade their star system for a \"Talk\" board, but I usually hate reviews that are solely rated on service alone.  Today, my stars are heavy with food and service, if it was all atmosphere, it'd be maybe a 3.  It's NOT a Sports Bar, they have A LOT of Beers (Score, when you can actually drink) and the place is adorable.  Atmosphere:  Love what they've done with the place, you cannot tell it was an old Mexican beach themed place that we all know as Salty's.  We all agreed that the heavy cast iron framed chairs (that's what it seemed like) were cute and modern but definitely not practical for spending any amount of time there.  Maybe that's what they want, to turn and burn.    Food:  We had the All American (Ham & Mozzarella), the Caprese (like the italian appetizer except with a thin slice of chicken), and the Sgt Pepper (thin sliced beef and roasted red peppers).  Between the 3 of us, I think I was the only one that was ok with my sammy, which was the Sgt. Pepper.   We all got the truffle oil parm fries and we all got dark brown burnt fries, I mean they were super over fried.  I saw pictures on other posts and thought, this is not what our plates looked like they were all burnt.  The Caprese feed back I got was it was burnt first off, so burnt ends of a chicken and burnt toast, there was way too much oil.  I also heard to many tomatoes, but i'm going to let that slide as it really should have only been a mozzarella and tomato sammy in the first place.  The All American wasn't too bad, but the fries ruined it so that's a little less american.  Service:  As soon as we sat, our server came over with a trainee, introduced both of them and kindly gave us time to digest the food menu, beer menu, and a \"specialty drinks\" menu.  Ok, so far right?  So, when the server came back she got our drinks order and was about to leave when I said, yeah we're ready to order too actually.  So she took our order and we were off, just patiently waiting for our meal, avoiding shop talk catching each other up on our weekend plans.  It was a cold windy day out so we opted to sit inside, but didn't notice the sliding glass doors to be open so we kept catching a breeze and asked our server is she minded us moving.  She said, sure no problem.  We knew it shouldn't be a problem is was just her and the trainee, minus the bartender, but she didn't count, we all know they are there to tend the bar!!     Well apparently our moving caused a huge mix up with our order so our server had to come back and ask us what we ordered.  UM, what?  We even asked if that meant she had to put it in again....no admitting that was the case, but another 20 minutes goes by, we were already at the 45 min mark, and we still were waiting for our meals.   What a disappointment when get our sammies and see nothing but burnt fries....Oh yeah and we sat off to the side so we could see the sous putting the plates together grabbing a hand full of fries with no gloves and setting it on our plate, this could have been avoided if the guy would have just put the fries on the plate before they were in the window.    Getting our Bill:  Oh yea....so we asked for our tab and she asked if we need it it separate.  We said separate if you can, but otherwise we'll just give you 3 cards.  So separate it was, but they deliver it in a hallowed out can, that doesn't fit cards in it, so it just becomes a chaotic rumble to hand off back to your server.  It took like 10 minutes to come back.  I am guessing it was because the first computer was not working properly, we saw her try it was like 5 ft from us.  She disappeared and didn't come back for 5-10 minutes (probably felt longer because by this time we were on our way to the 2hr lunch mark), not to mention they were brought back to us in freshly new hallowed out cans with our slips.  Its not working, cute idea, but try something else, like maybe find some barrels since you are Union Barrelhouse.  Bottom Line:  They've got some work to do. In this area you've got to shine...you have no excuse, there are so many options for me, and you have to give me a reason to come see you.  Right now, the # of taps seems to be an overcompensation to food and service.  An Apology for all the mix ups would have saved em some stars too."}
{"text":"Had the sliders. The bigger square bun hiding the round sliders is a culinary infraction. Still can't enjoy these ipa's and all the other wheat beers etc on tap. Call me traditional."}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum.  Situated in the old Salty Seniorita's location, this is a vast improvement over that ghetto place.  The patio is still there but is cleaned up.    This beer snob approves of the fantastic and ever changing beer rotation.  But the food. What great food!!  Thus far I can give two thumbs up to the pretzels/queso, the amazing chop salad that is served shaken up in a mason jar tableside, the mac and cheese, fantastic chicken wings, truffle parmesean fries, and the amazing sandwiches.  I've yet to have a bad meal here.    One night we have the pleasure of talking with the head chef as he meandered his way though the patio. Fantastic person to talk to and he discussed how he devised some of the menu items and upcoming changes.    I've always had friendly service and great food and beer. It's become a regular spot for me."}
{"text":"Stopped in the other day for happy hour and I was very impressed. They have a huge selection of local beers on tap, all of which are $2 off during happy hour. And while the appetizer list is small (only 5 or 6 selections I think) the quality is very good for the price. I highly suggest you try the mignionettes and the fondu."}
{"text":"The beer selection at UBH is great. Finally there is a place in downtown Scottsdale that will fill growlers.  The Waffle Battered Chicken Sandwich is probably the best sandwich I've had ever had."}
{"text":"We came here after receiving some coupons form a Yelp event. Glad we came in. I was in heaven..dark, old and classic looking bar with lots of rotating craft beers from around the country. I really enjoyed the Lagunitas imperial red. Just came back from the Bay Area and I've been to Lagunitas many times but nice to see I could get it here!  We also tried the gravy fries and wings and both were good.   Next time I want to try the Mac n cheese. Looks like a good place for a beer and some food."}
{"text":"I remember driving by this place as it was getting built (or I guess I should say remodeled...it's the old Salty Senorita) & was really looking forward to it's opening.  I stopped in on a Friday night w/a friend and really liked it. We only had a couple drinks, but the food menu looked good and I definitely want to stop back in to try some things. I liked the atmosphere as well. It has a very open/airy feel w/a slick, brewery vibe (I just totally made that up, but go with it).   Unfortunately, the place wasn't very crowded when we came in (and like I said, it was a Friday night). I hope that changes.   Union Barrelhouse has a pretty extensive drink menu. You'd expect a place like this to have a lot of beers on tap and they do . They also have several speciality cocktails, as well as whiskey cocktails. My friend had a couple of the later, and enjoyed them both.   What I really liked (and what I tried) were the beer \"cocktails\" (I don't think that's what they were actually called). They do a few different things all of which are interesting. I can't remember exactly what I had, but the first drink was a beer mixed w/sake & the second drink was a mixture of two different beers. Both were delicious. They also do beer/liquor combos that sounded interesting.   We sat at the bar, and the bartender serving us was attentive and knew the drink menu pretty well.   I hope this place does well. Scottsdale needs more places like Union Barrelhouse, and I really love what going on, on this corner between this place, Sip & Brat Haus. I actually stopped into Sip after here, and it sounds like all three places have a good working relationship."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Got a burger with some sea salt fries and filled me up! Decently priced as well."}
{"text":"Monster-sized salads, a wide beer selection and friendly bartenders combine with a sharp aesthetic to make this place a suitable Sunday spot. Plus, they show MLS soccer.  For a great salad, try the Second Street Farmers Market Salad with ahi tuna, substituting mozzarella for bleu cheese because bleu cheese is gross."}
{"text":"Pleasant bar environment w/ a large beer on tap selection.  Went for lunch, the sliders were tasty but w/ too much onion for my tastes.  The sea salt fries were good.  Ample off street parking.  Recommended."}
{"text":"Great location with a really nice atmosphere. It is really spacious here with a ton of bar seats.  We didn't eat but the food coming out looked delicious.  We'll definitely be back next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"Got two of the most recommended dishes: salmon and steak burger. Burger, ordered medium, was over cooked (from my husband -- he put this: beyond well done which is typically a fail, as one cannot taste the quality of the meat, and I assume the chef doesn't have control of his grill!) Salmon was a little under cooked as medium for my taste.   They would have gotten a 3 star due food but due to nice environment and friendly staff, and the management experience I got it a four star. The service and the manager were extremely nice. He came to check on us and found out about the burger issue and took it off the bill which was really nice for him to do -- hence the 4 star.   Overall, I like the atmosphere and the HUGE selection of their draft BEER and happy hour. The staff and management was super professional and nice.   If I lived here, I probably will come back again."}
{"text":"We had a coupon for a free appetizer or penny draft beer, so my husband and I decided to give this place a go. I am so glad we did! UB has its own beer, which it outsources to local companies. I like how it serves so much local beer. I got the union Hefe which was light and slightly citrusy. For our meal, we got the shaken chopped salad, the CCB, and the other grilled cheese with prime rib. All were very good. The prime rib one was so flavorful. The CCB was a little dry. The fries could have used more time in the fryer. But the service was great and the atmosphere was really nice. We sat outside.  The grilled cheeses definitely seem to be where it's at. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"OMGosh! I'm in LOVE with this place!!! Modern twist on old world menu classics. Their beer selection is enormous! 36+ beers on tap AND a bottled selection to boot! They don't stop there either! They have a worldly wine selection and creative modern twists on cocktail favorites! Ambience is spot on to the name. A modern clean take on everything you imagine a barrelhouse to be. Props to the design team, props to the executive chefs and the bar masters for their successful creative vision of nostalgia! And the staff is stellar  Kudos Union Barrelhouse!  Tip: ask for the chef's spicy mustard!"}
{"text":"I figured this would be another beer / food hipster new American imitation however they nailed it. The menu was slimmed down to fantastic choices. My girlfriend and I started with the mignonettes and the wings. They were delicious. The portion size of the mignonette left something to be desired but the wings were adequate. Both set the bar with flavor and freshness. The night was substantially busy leaving my assumption to believe service was slow. It was not! The BLC sandwich was also memorable, I had a side of peppercorn aioli with the sandwich which definitely popped in flavor. You can tell everything is fresh and they really care here. Topher and Colby were my helpers in the food selection and beer choice. They have wonderful drink compliments for every food selection. I would recommend this place to anyone. Beer, food, service with an ambience of New American."}
{"text":"Recently opened UBH is a huge hit!  We started with the gravy fries which were crispy and packed with unique flavors. We had a craft delivered chilled and fresh. We ordered an ice cream shake which was tasty,,,,, could have been a bit colder and with a little more ice cream but defiantly made up for that with plenty of tasty liquor.  The caprese melt... 10++.  The steak burger (chopped short rib) 10++.  Portions are large and of high quality. The atmosphere was 'chill' with great music, not too loud, and a happy staff made us feel welcomed. We even had a manger check to see how things were. As you can see I REALLY liked this new gem on Scottsdale Blvd :) Definitely in my Top 5 list for the Dale."}
{"text":"Great food and a wide variety of beers. The patio accommodated our group of 30 with no problem."}
{"text":"This place has so much potential but falls so short on everything. The patio will be sure to rock in the winter but the place is a deserted wasteland right now in the summer.  Stay away from anything with cheese sauce such as the cheese fondue. The stuff is literally worse than melted velveeta.  At happy hour they have $2.00 off apps. Not a very good happy hour.  It should have warned us not to order dinner but we did anyway. Major disappointment again.  They do have a lot of craft beer taps but sadly the selection is very pedestrian. they did have some good local brews like Four Peaks Hop Knot, Papago Orange Blossom and Huss Scottsdale Blonde but very little to really thrill a craft beer person seeking something more than mainstream offerings. Only had two IPAs on out of all the taps. So sad."}
{"text":"Love the beer selection, they usually have some Bell's on tap. Erin out server was awesome, she really knows the beer selection! The fried pickles and  buffalo chips were great bar food."}
{"text":"Modeled after the very trendy Angels Trumpet Ale House in downtown Phoenix, they've taken it a bit further and gone with a full bar, which is awesome. They have 32 rotating beer taps and 4 wine taps. It's a nice layout with plenty of outdoor seating. I'm interested to see what it looks like at night. I've been told that they plan on having live music Tue, Wed, and Fri. They just opened July 18, so I'll give them some slack on the food. New kitchens can take time to work out kinks, so I'll definitely give them another chance. Until then, the staff is nice and this is a great time to get in good with the staff."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times already and have nothing to say but great things.   The bar setup is the focal point and it is large and well serviced.   Thirty plus taps that are always revolving was what brought me in.   The bartender Colby took care of me and answered all my questions about the large bar menu.  I ordered the wings, they were awesome, well seasoned so I didn't even need the Buffalo sauce.   I will come back often."}
{"text":"It's a fun place to go with a group of friends or family. The servers are delightful and the beer samples are plentiful. Try the tasters group, so you can try out many beers. They always have a wine for happy hour too. We had melted sandwiches and burgers that were delicious and the parmesan fries are worthy of every bite."}
{"text":"The Bloody Mary with the grilled cheese is great the grilled cheese could be a little fresher on the day I went and it has a great location. I think I need a second trip there though"}
{"text":"After eating at Ra Sushi i Yelped \" beer brewery\" and this spot was walking distance from where we ate so I wanted to check them out. It had a nice \"Roadhouse\" vibe and nice beer selection. I think they had just under 40 beers on tap. We had a flight and tried a few different beers. Thought it was cool they served beer flights in a cupcake tray and numbered them by their menu so you knew what you were drinking. Every worker that walked by us smiled and food looked awesome! Next time I come her I'm for sure gunna have to try a few things on their menu!"}
{"text":"Was thoroughly disappointed with this place. Beer prices were insane as well as the food prices. Only reason this is getting 2 stars is bc the HR did a great job hiring a smokin hot hostess. Burger was alright I guess for $10"}
{"text":"The rating is  for the service.  I went in last week for a specific beer that they had on tap.  I ordered my beer, received my beer,  and closed out my tab.  I noticed that my beer was not discounted for happy hour.  I called over the bartender and he said-\"Oh, that beer is not available for happy hour\".  He then went on to blame the other bartender that he was training.  Mind you now I am staring at a chalk board that says \"$2 off ALL drafts 3-7\".  So I reiterated to the bartender that his chalkboard says \"All Drafts\".  He went on to say how it is an expensive beer and that they can't put it on HH.  I have zero problem with a beer not being availably for happy hour.  I'm a beer nerd.  I get that highly allocated beers are expensive. What I don't get is why it was so difficult for the bartender to 1. Take a piece of chalk and write \"All Beers Excluding \"X\" Beer.  2.  If he's gonna blame another bartender for the mistake, feel free to comp the $2.  It's blatant false advertising.  I know it's only $2 but obviously it's the principal of the situation.  I would love to hear how the manager would of handled this."}
{"text":"Took one of my clients here for Lunch . . . thought it would be good this it was a late lunch . . . I was wrong.  Ordered the Sergeant Pepper with Fries and and Iced Tea . . . The sandwich was pretty good . . . the fries seemed to be lacking the truffel oil and parmesan . . . and the iced tea was a little on the cloudy side.  On the good side . . . they have a great selection of beers . . . the only problem . . . it was a work day lunch . . . no beer for me.  I have had much better for lunch and probably won't be back for that . . . however . . . I will definately be back to try some of the beer selections."}
{"text":"nice variety of weird random beer.  pretty sure we used a groupon our first time in here.  sat out on the patio the 2nd time. i believe my favorite beer was some sorta cherry flavored ones.  like most places they let ya sample the random odd beers before you commit to the purchase"}
{"text":"Well we went in and it took about 6 min to get a menu sampled an ipa and the waiter never returned . Asked bar man if we could order from him and barman said we had to order from server so we waited and waited and finally we left , and on the way out the server says \"thanks for coming in \" what a dumb ass !"}
{"text":"We stopped in on a Sunday afternoon.  We had our toddler and 2 dogs since we just came from the dog park.  They were very accommodating and even brought the pups some water at our outside table.  The Speakeasy bloody mary is best I've ever had and the rest of the food with amazing also.  Try the wings!"}
{"text":"Ok prime location but...food was disgusting!  I don't really drink so we spent $72 on the worst meal I've had in a while.  My daughters Mac and cheese tasted like they boiled it in mop water!  While the waitress was apologetic the manager didn't even acknowledge the situation.  We had a party of ten and there were probably only 10 other people besides us in there! To top it all off someone paid all that money to create a really nice place but then bought the dumbest designed stools in life.  These bar stools are not only 70lbs but they are the opposite of comfortable.  If you are trying to get the customer to leave sooner than normal then they are winning.  All in all this place sucks"}
{"text":"Union Barrelhouse is a bear of a place that spreads out with an incredible amount of seating. The bar is expansive, wrapping around as a center piece of the restaurant, with booths lining the walls and tall tables in the middle of the restaurant. The outdoor patio is beautiful, reminiscent of a private home backyard.   I focus on the seating as you will want to stay. This joint is a brewery. They have a serious amount of beer to sample. The food I've tasted was decidedly comfort food and incredibly filling. A perfect match for the endless amount of beer you'll be tempted to drink. (Best to walk here. Or Lyft!)   My heart was sold when I learned they carried a porter. When the fall season returns dark beer returns to Arizona. It's not cold yet! But the dark beer is here. Bless you UNION Barrelhouse.  On the flip side I loooooorved two very light beers: Huss Scottsdale blonde kolsch Ub American Hefeweizen American  Good stuff.  Ok, food... The grilled cheese. You've got to try it. Also, they offer fries, smothered in bacon and cheese. Apparently they are trying to raise your cholesterol. (I will die happy.) Conveniently the menu suggests what each item is best paired with. No thinking required!  Isn't that that what beer is all about? :)  HH DETAILS Everyday 3-7PM  $8 Shot & Beer $5 House Wine (from the wall) & Wells $2 off all Drafts & Starters"}
{"text":"Everything from the service to the food was great. Wings are crispy, Mac n cheese was a small serving but yummy, fries are addictive and they have an amazing beer selection. Sticky Monkey is not bad for 13.4%!"}
{"text":"We saw the event on Yelp and wanted to check out the Grand opening..  It was extremelyyyyyy packed..It was hard to even find a seat because it was so busy. We ended up finding one, and I'm not sure if there were even waiters or waitresses because no one ever came to help us. We ended up finding seats at the bar and sat there. So I originally wanted to try their mac and cheese. & guess what, they were out.. Bummer. I ended up getting the Caprese. This has chicken, mozzarella, tomato, basil. Let's just say I liked their fries more than the entree. I think the truffle fries were the only good thing here.   My boyfriend ordered the union grilled steak burger. This thing was smothered in bbq sauce. & they made it way too hot because he burned his hand when the sauce dripped.   It was extremely loud and packed when we went. I couldn't hear anything anyone said. The only highlight was getting to see some of my Yelper friends there. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday haven't been in since it was Salty. The remodel looks nice but i have to say its very loud place because of how the acoustics are here. I ordered the daily soup which was potato and bacon and parmesan fries. My friend ordered a burger and regular fries.   Service was very slow as other yelpers have stated, our food took 45min+ to come out.   My soup was hot but my parmesan fries were cold. My friends burger was cold and so were his fries. This leads me to believe that the food sat at kitchen for a while. This is unacceptable and the kitchen should know better.   My potato and bacon soup had zero taste to it, which surprised me.   We told our server and she was nice about it and replaced our fries for free.   We ended talking to the manager about the food and the manager ended up comping the food. Which i have to say is taking care of the customers. So i will give 3 stars for that. Ill be back to try them out again."}
{"text":"Guys with tattoos and beards? Check Overly loud music playing? You betcha Various things served in mason jars? Damn skippy  Awesome patio for the one month it's temperate in Arizona? Absolutely. Basic burgers, fries, sandwiches, etc? Yup   Eight trillion beers on tap and flights to sample? Of course. Kitchy decoration and cool lighting? DUH  Nothing great, nothing awful. It's another burger and beer joint teeming with Old Town foodies, families, drunken baseball fans and guys in skinny jeans."}
{"text":"I've been to UB probably a half-dozen times at this point and figured it was a time for a review. First the positives, I love the space - amazing decor, huge space, awesome outdoor patio, giant beer board, and the parking is really convenient too. The happy hour is a good deal if you stick to beer - often you can score some great releases for $3 or $4 bucks a pour.   However, there are quite a few negatives as well. About those beer pours, the UB takes the stance that 1-1.5 inches of head is a good pour. Well that might be fine when we're talking about a pint glass here - but when you leave several inches of space on my 10oz snifter, I'm not going to be happy. I've never complained about bad pours, but for one bartender in particular there, it was ridiculous. The other bartender working actually came by and took my glass back and added to it the last time it happened, apologizing for the bad pour, so I know its not just me here. Another thing that bothered me is that the bad-pour bartender also proceeded to have a conversation at the bar within earshot of my group about how he couldnt wait to get off and head downtown to get wasted at Chase Field. Now, I don't know about you, but I would think discussing plans to get hammered in front of customers wouldnt be acceptable in a nice establishment.   Now, about the food. The happy hour menu is a complete waste of money - I've ordered a couple items from there and all are very undersized for the price - nothing \"happy\" about that! The mac and cheese came out in a tiny tray and when i saw it, I actually started laughing - probably about 5 bites of food for $7 bucks? It was crazy, I sent that back immediately. On 2 other visits, we've tried to order the parmesean garlic fries with our meals - and both times they came out cold and soggy in a tiny tray. We tried to send them back once, only to receive the same soggy sad excuse for a fry back in return. Steer clear. I've had a few items that were decent from the menu, the seared tuna and the patty melt were both nice but IMO, this place is just not worth the inconsistent service, food, and pricing."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to try this place out.  I have heard mixed reviews and wanted to see for myself.  I was told the service was terrible and it was an accurate statement.  For our party of 9 we did get a table fairly quickly but that's where the speedy service stopped.  Although our server Kelton was awesome, seriously he was great, we loved him, it took FOREVER for our food to make it to our table.  It appeared it was definitely an issue with the kitchen.  Not only were we waiting a ridiculous amount of time for our food, once the food started trickling out, it took a while for the entire table to get their food.  I ordered the beets, they were cooked well and great flavor and I ordered the Mac and Cheese which was delicious.  My husband is a vegetarian and it was slim pickens for choices for someone who doesn't eat meat.  He ordered the veggie burger and surprise they were out of it so he ended up with the grilled cheese which was forgettable.  When it came time for dessert they were out of peaches for the peach crumble.  I'm going to assume they use extremely fresh ingredients to be out of so many things.  Overall we enjoyed it but very timely wait for food.  Again Kelton was great!!"}
{"text":"I have been here for lunch a few times over the past month. They have a really good rotating beer selection. I like that they have a section on their beer list for what is going to be tapped next. They also have a very impressive selection of whiskey, which surprised me for a beer focused place.  I really like what they did with the layout. The bar is central and all around it is really open, but welcoming. It is a very comfortable environment to relax and enjoy your beer, food and company. (I have only been here for lunch, so I can't comment on the atmosphere in the evening yet.)  I have had a few of the items on the menu so far and I haven't been disappointed. Their mac and cheese is my favorite. If you like salads, you should really try the Farmer's Market salad. Great flavors, and a big enough to fill me up for lunch. It paired really well with the Founder's Rubeus that they had on tap at the time. I wasn't the biggest fan of the bread on the Pear, Brie and Jam sandwich I had. It was a little too thick and crusty for my taste, but that is just personal preference. That said, the sandwich still had really good flavor and I wasn't unhappy with it at all. The fries also had really good flavor, but I wish they had been more crisp. Again, personal preference.  I have had nothing but excellent service here, both at the bar and sitting at a table. It has never been very busy at lunch, but I have always had friendly and attentive service from everyone here.  The prices are also very good for what you get here. I will definitely continue coming in for lunch."}
{"text":"Saw some good yelp posts thought we would check it out as we were in town from CA. Perfect choice! Awesome beer selection and the food was amazing. Seriously, couldn't find a single thing wrong even if I wanted to."}
{"text":"After a long day of studying at a nearby coffee shop, we stopped in here to grab a quick appetizer and drink to hold us over until dinner.  I couldn't believe the sheer number of beer choices on tap; Union Barrelhouse literally must have a house full of barrels hidden under the bar.  I'm not a huge beer drinker myself, but there were plenty of cider choices and light seasonal beers that were superb.  We somehow managed to stumble in right at happy hour, too, so the beers were incredibly cheap (something like $5/drink).  Definitely recommend the Elderberry cider.  The only thing stopping me from rating Union Barrelhouse a perfect five was the food.  I thought our wings were a little lackluster - as embarrassed as I am to admit this, I think Hooters has better wings by far - but then again, who comes to a barrelhouse for food?"}
{"text":"I've been in here a few times and like the clean atmosphere. The selection of beer is good. My only reluctance is the culinary aspect. It's pretty good quality but hasn't yet amazed me to the point I'd recommend it hands down. Especially the mac 'n cheese. Compared to the mac 'n cheese they serve at Fate in North Scottsdale or Cold Beer Cheeseburgers, it's left much to be desired."}
{"text":"Craft beer! Craft beer!  36 taps, all craft and no crap.  Some good happy hour deals and a few weekdays have specials all day long.  Enjoyed my burger and fries and had top notch service.  Convenient that they have their own parking lot in the back too, unlike other nearby beer places (ahem, Brat Haus next door).  Place has a somewhat modern atmosphere feel to it, nicely dressed and polite staff, and it's very clean."}
{"text":"So second time around I was way disappointed. They changed the menu for no good reason other than to make me never want to return. Why fix something that's not broken. The hummus was straight disgusting. The barrel pizza sucked and was way better w the English muffin. Place sucked."}
{"text":"So average but could be so much more overall poor slow service on a Friday night 8pm not busy E er one is apathetic food was okay.   Wish I could have went somewhere  else oh well next time."}
