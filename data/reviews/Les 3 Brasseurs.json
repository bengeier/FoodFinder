{"text":"BBQ chicken pizza tasted like it had been made earlier today, found an ant scurrying next to our table. When I told the waiter this he jokingly said he didn't control the ants and told us about the bee problem they had over the summer. Great.

Would not recommend, go to one of the many downtown locations instead."}
{"text":"This review is from a tourist's and first time visitor to Montreal's point of view. My husband and I were staying in a hotel around the corner, and this place was recommended to us since we wanted some local beer, as we hear Montreal is known for! 

As someone who knows about 3 words in French, I was thankful that there was a menu in English, and the woman who served us spoke English very well. 

The poutine was excellent (my first one)! I was dying for some vegetables after a long day of airport food, so I just had a caesar salad, which tasted much like any other Caesar salad you've ever had. My husband had a burger, and he thought it was great. 

I'm not much of a beer drinker, so I tried the rasp-beer-y lemonade, which has a very light beer in it, but you couldn't taste it at all. It was amazing! I bet it is an awesome choice in the summer. My husband was very impressed with the large beer selection, and liked the few he ordered.

The vibe was very relaxed, and on a weekday night there wasn't a huge crowd. We came back with some friends over a weekend and there were a lot more people. We sat at the bar, had a drink, and watched a game. There are a lot of tv's and is a great place to watch sports.

Free wi-fi!

We had two great experiences here. It was a fun place to go. I'm not sure what locals think if it, but I would recommend checking this place out if you're visiting and looking for a place to chill."}
{"text":"Bonne bière, bon repas et excellent service."}
{"text":"Un bar-restaurant  Moyen  Qualité des aliments moyenne  On sent que c'est une chaîne de restaurants  Et comme souvent la qualité n'est pas une priorité  Dommage  Car le service est attentif, et cela malgré le sous effectif que l'on peut voir En résumé : qualité / prix moyen"}
{"text":"Mauvais service! 55 minutes plus tard. ..pas de verre d'eau même si on as demander 2 fois et pas de plat....

2e experience ici et c'est toujours pareil. ..le chaos total!  A éviter !"}
{"text":"We walked through the streets and we're looking for a nice place to eat. By accident we stopped here (around 6pm) it was easy to find a table and we had a very excellent service. I loved the beer, very good. Also the food was quite good except that my steak was not medium any more. Price is slightly on the high side it still acceptable for location, quality and service."}
{"text":"First time here; watched hockey match and enjoyed the beers. Order the beer samplers if not sure which beer to choose. Nachos are great; I added steak to it. Smoked meat sandwich is great too"}
{"text":"Very busy but less waitress . Waited 25 mins to just get water and food came after 1 hr. Management should hire more people . The food is just simple bar food.The waitress was rude since we didn't speak french . Yeah, you should say on a board outside that tourists are not invited. Avoid this place ."}
{"text":"I went for cheese burger and fries on a Tuesday evening. I was seated and had my order taken pretty quickly. My food arrived pretty quickly too. Cheese burger was good. It was juicy and tasty. For some reason the fries were not hot so I guess they must have been sitting before I ordered waiting be paired with the burger. I also had a glass of coke. I am not really a fan of tap soda and this one too was kind of flat. I also asked for mayo after my order arrived and that was the slowest part of the service- I  was almost done eating when they brought it. All in all, it's an OK place for pub fare but nothing stellar. The bill came to about $22 with tax."}
{"text":"I was so impressed with the menu and selection.  We stopped in after a day of traveling and had a couple of great beers and a delicious flatbread.  I hand't heard of the restaurant before and was surprised to learn that it was a chain.  I look forward to returning so that I can try some more of the menu.  I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I came here with friends on week day. The food we ordered was blond beer, burger and calmar frits. The food was awesome. The service is a littl bit slow, but overall, the experience is great."}
{"text":"Horrible service, had to wait 15 min to be seated and place was empty. The nachos I got were microwaved and stale with cheese not even melted, 2/10 wasted my money on this."}
{"text":"Had an awful lunch in Montreal. It looks like a bar, locate in one of the main shopping street, but food was awful--- it cannot be worse. Limo made was diluted and they charge the price of 2 for a refill. French onion soup was salty, and the smoked salmon tastes \"not cooked at all\". And for that \"lunch\", which got me run to the bathroom on the highway, was priced for 40 dollars. Never, never have it again!"}
{"text":"Max is a great waiter and the la belle province is great! Atmosphere is also great :)"}
{"text":"I've ate at les trois brasseurs several times in the past but this time didn't enjoy it very much. The portion size has definitely gone down. I ordered the trois brasseur burger and it comes with a tiny bowl of fries. In the last there used to be a fairly large portion of fries and now it is very little. I was still hungry after eating and needed to order an appetizer. The appetizers are over priced compared to most restaurants as well. I may go back someday if I have friends going but definitely would not make it top of my list. Oh and I was given such a small amt of sauce that I didn't have enough for the burger itself :( The waitress didn't come around much and only seemed friendly when it was time to pay bill because of the tip probably."}
{"text":"While waiting for our train ( had 3 hours to kill) we decided to find a place to eat. Down the stairs we saw Les 3 Brasseurs. Being it our last day in Montreal we said why not. I ordered the 3 Brasseurs burger with cheese and Bacon, while my partner ordered the Quebecois flamm. The burger is nothing to write home about. The patty was moist but bland, and the cheese and bacon were unnoticeable. I did however like the bun. The fries were pretty good as well.  My boyfriend enjoyed his flamm, but then again he likes thin crust pizza. 

If you are looking for a place for beer, this is the place. Anything else is a guess.

Oh and if you are sitting outside, don't expect to see your server anytime soon."}
{"text":"Our starving yet patient family of four came upon Les 3 Brasseurs after trying to book many other restaurants. Fortunately, we didn't have to wait long to be seated. However the service was quite slow because we had one polite and helpful waitress for about 20 tables.  The bar scene looked fun for 20 somethings, the restaurant was giant, like a fancier version of Chili's.  With more staff and a healthier menu, this could be a fantastic family restuarant for Vieux Montreal. Good fallback for a family."}
{"text":"If you are a tourist on your first day in Montreal and hungry this is a good place. Friendly, but not the best."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this location in the past and food was...okay but today was a nightmare. Ordered the special which came with cream of mushroom soup. They failed to inform me that it was Campebells soup from the can. Ordered Onion Rings which were premade as well. My club sandwich had a metallic taste to it. Very disappointed that restaurants are now taking the easy route with premade ready to use food and cannot muster up enough power to make something as simple as soup!!!! You really are paying for the atmosphere and beer!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here a couple of times to eat and a couple of times for drinks while we were in Montreal. It was within walking distance of our hotel and offered up an affordable and fast place to eat and enjoy a delicious beer. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Flammkuchen sind die Spezialität. Das Restaurant war auch um 14h noch gut belegt - dadurch etwas laut. Die Preise sind verhältnismässig günstig, insbesondere wenn man es als Menü bestellt."}
{"text":"I just finished the \"pulled\" pork sandwich. It was shredded pork mixed up with some sub-standard BBQ sauce. The food so far has been nothing remarkable. I attempted to order a pitcher of beer, but I was told no, as she assumed I meant of water. She left before I could say \"of blonde\".  The server doesn't speak any English and probably did not attend any post primary education. She will not be receiving a tip from me, and I usually tip a generous 20%. Every aspect of this establishment is of two star value, as.d 2 stars it shall get. The beer, the very namesame of the chain, is a surprising two and a half star. Hopefully this shared pitcher will be enough to help me expel the food I so sorrowfully payed for."}
{"text":"I give this place five stars just for the beer battered maxi fries. Nice selection of beers and I liked that they gave pairing recommendations for each menu item. We got their flatbreads -- I highly recommend the artisanal meat one. Overall, tasty and filling food, fair prices, and great service."}
{"text":"Food was good and very fast.  Like incredibly fast.  Servers and staff were very efficient.  Food was a little expensive for what you got but overall a good dinner"}
{"text":"Enjoyed after dinner beers at the bar: the Brown was delicious. Nice atmosphere on a Sunday evening - busy but not obnoxious."}
{"text":"Service was superb! The food was amazing and the beer was definitely the highlight of the whole experience. The manager was very kind to offer us a serving of the Caesar salad which tasted really good. I got their signature 3 brasseurs burger and the beef patty was juicy with the right amount of tenderness. They also recommended the blonde beer to go with the burger and it truly clicked! Overall, a very satisfying meal in this crazy cold winter."}
{"text":"The best thing about this place is that they brew their own beer. I sampled about 3 of the different brews and found them all to be pretty good. I was here during the Canadian Gran Prix so the restaurant was pretty packed. The hostess and waitress informed us that our food would take awhile to come out because they were so busy which tells me that they overbuilt the seating in this place and under-built their kitchen capacity. The food is enjoyable but you will not walk away saying you had a great meal. This was the first place I ever had poutine and I found it to be pretty good. The service was a tad on the slow side but I'd imagine on a non-event weekend the service would be alright. If you want a meal that you won't hate along with some decent beer and a lively atmosphere this is your place."}
{"text":"On y mange et bois bien, l'ambiance est assurée, le service aussi, et les prix corrects, le charme québécois en plus !"}
{"text":"All what i was expecting from a brewery. Good beer, decent burger, nice waitress... What does a men more need?"}
{"text":"I only come here because I LOVE their beer, but I could care less about the food, I do order their \"klnda\" pizza from time to time. Come here with a group of friends or to watch hockey games at the bar."}
{"text":"Their pizza it's pretty good!! (they call it differently since it's not technically a pizza, since it has no sauce) and their beer is delicious, I recommend the amber one. Great decor, nice atmosphere, even for families, and also great service."}
{"text":"The rib steak was fat...but the mash potato was awesome and the beer. Although onw beer was flat and after we told the waitress she exchanged it immediately. Great service!!"}
{"text":"I went to the one at the old port. I had the thin pizza as an appetizer and the sausages for dinner. The food wasn't very good, I don't think I will go here again. The service was decent and the atmosphere is typical pub. I think there are many other places to go that have better food."}
{"text":"Food: No matter how people like or complain about this place I must say they never fail to obey one of the Golden rules of dining experience: Consistency. Have been there a few times and yes, unless you are a fan of micro-brewery beers, the food itself is nothing to be impressed about. The so-fancy Flemms are actually just thin pizzas (yes let's call them what they really are). But regardless, every time the food tastes the same good way! So when I get deceived over and over again, I come here for some reliability hihi~

Service: Warm, welcoming and always willing to explain the items on the menu.

Price: Avg, but some items tend to be on the upper scale for pub food

Ambiance: Very Cage aux sports (sports bar) style. Great place to come watch a game! But for casual dining, there are way better places where you do not need to scream to hear each other talking~"}
{"text":"We stumbled into 3B after walking around the old city, and what a find! Good beer, good prices (!!!) and a very well made Caesar salad (with bacon bits) and perfect fries (the special beer batter ones). Beer selection was good, from an NYC perspective, with 6-8 varieties on tap. Some of the bigger dishes were too pricey for us but the simple bar food was perfect for our desire that day. Did not rate 5 star because the chicken wings were a bit plain and there was no hot sauce, but maybe there was a language error since we ordered in English ?? Good for groups and smaller parties, great beer, local brews, and good bar food. Excellent choice for a visit to the old city on a budget."}
{"text":"Went there two nights in a row. Excellent local IPA and Wit beers. Salads were huge and very good. The cassoulet was superb; great flavor and a generous serving. The Poutine was also very good. Our waitress (both evenings as it turned out), Jen, was excellent with a nice sense of humor. Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"It makes no sense to go there if you don't speak French. They put all attention to French speaking customers and ignore English speaking customers. Even if English is your 5'th language. Food is OK but beer is actually quite bad. Tastes like water."}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday night with a friend after work. I'm all about pub food and after a long day, I was looking forward to drinks and something greasy and delicious to comfort me.

Our server was really fantastic, honestly the highlight of our stay at Les 3 Brasseurs. she was quick, courteous, and let my indecisive friend and I take our time ordering.

My friend got the dijon mussels and they were pretty delicious. She loved them and the one she let me try was great. 

I, on the other hand got the Texas burger with a side of fries. For $13.25 I expect a certain quality of burger... What I received was a dry, pre-formed patty  which was smaller than the bun with a heap of shredded lettuce, mushrooms, fried onions (the best part of the burger). I can't know, because I don't work in the kitchen, but I am fairly certain this patty came from frozen. I should have been concerned when the waitress didn't ask how I liked my meat cooked (medium rare, if you must know) but I recieved a burger done medium-well and it was absolutely dry. I couldn't finish it. I ate the fries, which were nothing to write home about either. They also forgot to include the jalapenos, which were supposed to come as a topping... I guess this kind of burger would be acceptable for a Harvey's or something, where you get what you pay for (6$ for a pre-formed patty and some fries) but for 14 bucks I'd much rather go to another pub where they will actually give me a decent, nay, excellent burger. There are plenty of pubs in the downtown core who charge similar prices and have MASSIVE, home-made burgers which can be cooked to your specifications. 

It was my first time there and, considering how many pubs and restaurants are in that area, I will never return."}
{"text":"Drinkene var fantastisk!! Særlig jordbær-øl-mojitoen. Anbefales! Ellers har de også veldig godt øl å hyggelige ansatte :-)"}
{"text":"I guess we got stuck here at rush hour (around lunchtime), they stuck my fiancée and me at a rickety little drinking table on high stools. I understand, the place was packed, but we would have waited for a booth if we'd been given the option. Namely because we were just there to eat, and our two plates of food were practically falling off the table, not to mention our waters, coffee and coffee fixins that they just kept piling onto the unbalanced table. 

The food quality was good, but still a little on the pricey side. There was a strange scrap of brown paper in our food but nothing too awfully perturbing. I think with better seating I might have enjoyed it more, and it's probably highly recommended to partake of it all with a few beers.

The service was about what you'd expect, but there was only one waitress who kept ending up behind the bar to get people more drinks. And that's with this place at nearly capacity. I get that it's busy, and I can't help but empathize with the waitress, but they need more people on the floor with a rush like that. If they're getting that much business there's no excuse for a lack of service.

Overall it was just a very cramped, unenjoyable eating experience. I'm not one for the bar scene on a good day, and this has definitely turned me away from another attempt, particularly at this establishment."}
{"text":"Our server was terribly rude and slow. She was extremely defensive when my friends mentioned their nachos (2 separate orders that arrived simultaneously) were cold and the cheese had hardened. She said \"there is no way the nachos could be cold\". They were. My friends were very pleasant about it and she was aggressive. I ordered a green salad to start and it was great. My main was the roast chicken. The beans were cooked perfectly, the mashed potato was delicious but half of the chicken breast was very dry. I really enjoyed the IPA and the Brown, but found the Amber tasted a bit off. I though it had a foul taste. One of my friends tried it and he agreed. I mentioned this to the server and she did not react, she just looked at me - no response.  She left the 90% full beer sitting on the bar, even after I told her I thought it tasted off and pushed it away from me. As we were finishing our last drink, the staff started cleaning the bar around us with a chemical cleaner / metal polish and it was so strong, our eyes started to water. We mentioned it to the server and she ignored us. A supervisor/manager walked by and we mentioned that maybe they should wait until the establishment closes before breaking out the chemical cleaning agents. He said \"I know it smells bad, and I am sorry for that. Smelling it isn't harmful for you, but you shouldn't eat it. I have been working here for 5 years and it hasn't killed me.\""}
{"text":"Sat at the bar.  Very friendly, even charged my phone for me.  Beer good.  Flat bread and bruschetta great post hockey game fare.  Convivial, good service, good food, good drinks."}
{"text":"Service hyper lent. Environ 45 minutes alors que le resto est pratiquement vide par un dimanche.
L'aide serveur échappe un plat en crachant un tonitruant \"fuck\"
La frite arrive en même temps que la facture..."}
{"text":"Really good food and drink. Excellent onion rings and great sun dried tomato and goat cheese \"pizza\""}
{"text":"This restaurant is SO underrated!! Even though it's a chain, I absolutely love their flammekueches and the beers are absolutely lovely! I'm dying to go back!"}
{"text":"I had read that this was one of the best burgers in the area. 

If a heavily compacted, frozen, overcooked patty is included in the best burger list then I guess I could see it as great!

This was a very very over-rated burger! I seek out great burgers everywhere I go, and this wasn't even close! 

Do yourself a favour and try somewhere else. Anywhere! Try McDonalds for all I care, as it wouldn't be worse!!! 

2 stars for the pleasant bartender. Otherwise this is a zero."}
{"text":"I think this place is overestimated: the service is super slow, meat platter was looking like it consisted from the cheapest ingredients from No Frills, Fish and Chips did not actually have a decent piese of fish and waitress forgot about our beer. and oh yes: looks like you can smoke on patio!:("}
{"text":"One word: MEDIOCRE
We were 2, waited a long time when they were not busy to be seated, we asked for one of the many empty small booths, and were told that they were only for 3 or 4, meanwhile they soon filled up with only groups of 2.
Then our waiter got our order wrong... 
The calamari was bad. 
And the food was nothing to write home about.
Their special beer wasn't even good. 
Bottom line: finally tried it and will not go back."}
{"text":"The quality of the food is sub par, perhaps it may have been better if served as soon as it was ready rather than minutes later.  Fries were sadly soggy and unjoyable, garlic bread was cold.  When asking the waiter why the appetizers were taking over 40 minutes he looked at us accusingly and said we have to wait 'because there are a lot of people'.  It really was not that crowded.  I had to go to the bar for a glass of iced water.  The bartender acknowledged my request, left the bar to bring a table their drinks, cleaned off anptjer table, brining the dishes to the wait station and then came back to give me my water.  We are still at our table an hour later, entrees nowhere in sight, and 4 minutes away from walking out.

This is a horrible display of service."}
{"text":"Maybe it's because we're there at the wrong time. The first time I was there was a work lunch thing, so we couldn't try out their beer. Their food wasn't spectacular, it's what you expect from a franchise restaurant. The second time I was there, I was expecting for a good Mojito (I've been craving one), and... they told me they ran out of mint leaves, which is absolutely understandable. But when I asked for green tea after dinner, they said they didn't have that. I mean, how can they not have such common drinks? 

Other than that, the atmosphere and the service quality are the best. Our waiter was one of the friendliest guys I've ever met. He made my dinner experience absolutely amazing and hilarious."}
{"text":"Came here with the fam, last year , really good service , order la blond its like the best beer , I never really drank beer or liked it until I had there beer. its good for groups,  if You're from the states its kinda like TGI fridays but bigger and the decor is nice.  And alot of good beers to choose from, the food is really good too, burgers are amazing."}
{"text":"In town alone, looking for quick take away dinner, I wandered into Les 3Brasseurs. While waiting for my order, Max offered me a sample of their ginger beer. I ended up ordering a half pint. I had the price wrong on the beer and paid too little, but they wouldn't let me fix it. I ate my food back at the hotel. It was delicious (beer burger), but I was so impressed by the kindness and hospitality of the staff to a nonFrench speaking out-of-towner. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Bof. La spéciale 3 Brasseurs était sèche et trop salée.
En revanche, le service était impeccable."}
{"text":"On est allé pour fêter nos anniversaires, et c'est complet au jeudi soir! Le style est exactement comme cet Resto à l'Europe, menu en journal style, bon bière bon nourriture, bon ambiance est surtout près de chez nous."}
{"text":"I've been to this location once but multiple times at the other location in brossard (Dix30),
the food was in my opinion excellent for what it is, pub fare. 

I like the food and the decor, the service however needs some work. There are not enough servers for the size of the locations, so, you're constantly waiting on things. 

The beer, well, it's meh. There is a reason we don't see it on store shelves, it's a novelty... Nothing more. 

All in all - a great place for a nice quick, casual, meal."}
{"text":"Super ambiance, super bières, très bonne cuisine style brasserie ..."}
{"text":"Super à tester en sortant du cinéma ...."}
{"text":"Je n'y ai pas bien mangé! 

Les pâtes à pizza et flammèche ne sont pas cuites et la qualité des produits dessus laisse à désirer. Le steack n'est pas à la bonne cuisson, bref, la bouffe laisse à désirer.

L'attente est extrêmement longue et c'est super bruyant!!!

On y boit de la bière c'est peut être la seule valeur sûre, et encore, quand on a goûté aux unibroues du Québec, la bière des brasseurs est un peu comme de l'eau. 

Je déconseille fortement, ou peut être les soirs de match avec des amis déjà bien entamés ;)"}
{"text":"good beer, tasty flatbreads, fast wifi. our server was really nice and informative"}
{"text":"The food is decent, nothing much to crave but good to have a drink with a friend, if it is something to be desired.  I think the only reason I go here is usually because I want to share a drink with friends, not really to eat the food.  If I wanted eat, I usually share a dish of nachos with friends but that is about it.  The restaurant is always busy and almost always crowded and busy.  Usually, I don't really see the waitress much other than when being asked what the order is and when to pay.  I'm usually not asked if things are going well or not, but probably that's because the waitress is so busy waiting on other tables and bringing food to other tables as well.  I think if there weren't such a variety of drinks, especially pitchers of drinks to share with friends, I wouldn't dine at the restaurant."}
{"text":"This place has become a stand-by.  The quality of the food and the drinks are consistently good, but nothing to write home about, save for their Oktoberfest burger (more on that later).

As for beers, there's a nice selection.  I usually get a mix: the white mixed with some peach schnapps.  It's a nice, spirited, fruity beer drink that is quite agreeable to the ladies (and gents, as well).  The blond-beer burger is my favourite main. Though you can't order the burger medium-rare, it's a good size, and tastes really good.  

Skip dessert here, and don't be tempted by any of the \"flamms\" (sweet or savoury).  They're too crunchy, too thin, and the toppings are sparse.  

My favourite dish here has to be the Oktoberfest burger.  It's a delicious juicy burger topped with... PULLED PORK!  The plate is served with lengthy, toothsome, and crisp sweet-potato fries.  Why can't they serve it year-round?  All I can say is that this dish has me jonesing for the autumn months."}
{"text":"I have been at the Trois Brasseur on Crescent Street on a Sunday Afternoon... it was AWESOME.  Great Burger.  Went this time at the St Paul Trois Brasseur in Old Montreal on a Friday Night.  It was Terrible.  

Beer was good, as expected.  Burger was a HUGE disappointment.  Cold Fries and Cold Burger, for all three of us.  Service was below average, not very attentive and server (Max) spoke french even though he spoke and understood english.  I mean come on, how hard is it to cook and burger and deliver hot.  My three year old son was offered NOTHING in terms of crayons, let alone, we order him a bottled water and the straw was shorter than the length of the bottle.  Very frustrating.  I guess they don't care, and as such, like any consumer, you simply take your business elsewhere.  Restaurants that server burgers in Montreal are a dime a dozen.  It's not that hard.  Try Dilalo's, and you will understand."}
{"text":"We were a little bit obsessed with this place. We came here numerous times on our most recent trip to Mtl, and we had visited in previous years as well. The beer keeps us coming back, namely the seasonal raspberry wheat! A lovely refreshing beer for the summer. We came just my fiancé and I, and also with a group of friends a few times. We always enjoy the food, and we've tried quite a bit of the menu. Burgers, flatbread pizzas, mussels, calamari, onion rings, pretzels, poutine, etc! Everyone enjoyed it here. The service was mostly excellent, a few better than others of course. We miss this place already, there aren't many microbreweries at home in Newfoundland!"}
{"text":"Good wings and pizza for a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"one of the better 3 brasseurs i find. service was unexpectedly fast for the servers being crushed. and the food was fine nothing special but not terrible either."}
{"text":"Never again.. Mom uses a rollator coz she has a hard time walking. The girl in the reception is giving us a weird look.. Like she has never seen a rollator in her life.. Making us feel uncomfortable.. Then the other girl with her (curly hair) made us walk around and insisted that she will take the rollator back and leave it at the front.. This rollator can be folded but i guess they are that ignorant. Then she went back and talk to the ignorant girl at reception.. And started looking back at us ehile they whisper at each other.. Never again!!!! I come here in a regular basis every time I get sent to Montreal for work since my hotel is close by.. But not anymore."}
{"text":"Recently in Montreal, my boyfriend and I ventured into Les 3 Brassuers for a snack and got a couple of beers to try their brew out. We ordered a pizza that was delicious! The crust/dough was almost a cross between a crepe and pizza dough and the pesto drizzle on the pizza was phenomenal! The cheese and tomatoes on the pizza were very fresh and overall, we were very impressed. We were only in for a snack, otherwise we would have ordered more food. We each got a beer, both of which were good, but not our favorite. It was quite crowded, but it was a Friday night. Coming from Boston, the crowd was nothing extreme and very manageable. The atmosphere was very fun and we would both return and get food, but probably not one of their beers."}
{"text":"Great bar. Nice vibe. Awesome home brews. I had the 4-beer sampler to taste their brews and all of them was pretty good. Went for a pint of their \"Blanche\" afterwards, perfectly refreshing on a hot day."}
{"text":"Came out one night for a beer.  We split a pitched of the amber ale, which was pretty good I suppose.  We had some maple syrup whiskey called Sortilege that was out of this world good!  Def try it.  I ordered the French Onion soup.  It had green onions sliced up in the soup itself, which was different.  Otherwise it was pretty bland, almost to the point that I needed to add salt.  The bartender was lovely.  They have two menus, French and English, which was nice as well.  I was just sum it up by saying that it wasn't anything great, but not bad."}
{"text":"This was my second time in Montreal, the first time I went I visited a Les 3 Brasseurs at a different location and loved it. Loved it so much I went again this time around and I loved it even more so I had to write a review!
Amazing regardless of any location, all of them must be amazing. Excellent food, excellent service. Great recommendations from the server. My boyfriend and I shared the 3B Poutine which was incredible. We shared the Moulin Rouge which was also amazing. We also shared the fried calamari which was great, the aioli that came with is was also unbelievable. My boyfriend had a beer and isn't a big fan of beers, i believe he had Le Blanche, but he loved it he said it was so great. I would definitely go back here time and time again. So happy there are a few locations in Toronto where I'm from so I won't only have to go when I'm in Montreal!!"}
{"text":"Service was bad, my friend and I were seated at a table for 4 and when the place got busy the server asked (not nicely) us to move to a table of 2. We didn't want to sit at a table of 2 because it was too small for the amount of food we were going to order, then the GM came and asked as to move as we were taking space, needless to say, we got the check and left. Never again I would go back because of the bad service. I mean, I used to work in restaurants so I get it, however if they asked nicely, we would of moved.. I don't know if this is a trend in Montreal resto to ask customer to move but this kind of request has to stop."}
{"text":"People are writing that the service wasn't good. My experience tonight showed the opposite. At 915pm on a Friday we were seated promptly, served our drinks and then our food fairly after. And it looks like a full house too. For the price, service, and quality of food expected, I was not disappointed."}
{"text":"Loved it! What a charming chain . Cool to see a multi-location establishment like this customize its offerings for individual neighborhoods - and countries, my boyfriend apparently went to a 3B years ago in Tahiti! Our waitress, Marie-Suzanne, was super attentive and very knowledgeable about the beer list - which is extensive! Laissez les bons temps rouler à Montreal"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink and the girl behind the bar was miserable. Not sure if it is because we don't speak French but after forgetting our order then second beer was overflowing so she just put a napkin under it - not impressed.  Good thing the beer is good."}
{"text":"I guess this place is good for a couple of beers but if you are hungry, make yourself a favor an look further. The service is ok. They provide few  information and service is slow. I order the new* chicken. It was salty. They marketed as cooked on white beer.. i doubt!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend used to love trois brasseur, until they recently changed the menu. They removed the best burger ever, the portobello burger! We will probably go again for a beer but I don't think we will order a meal there ever again."}
{"text":"The service was excellent. That's where the positives end. Tried the 6 beer sampler since I like microbrews and enjoy trying a wide variety. I could not stomach any of them. All were very yeasty and just plain awful. The IPA had barely a hint of hops, and the red and stout were also incredibly sweet as well as yeasty.  The food was underwhelming as well. All had potential, but then poorly executed. 

Did I mention the service was great?  And yes, that's where they were successful. They should abandon the idea of brewing their own beer or hire someone who knows how to brew something worth drinking. Generally microbrews are rich and complex and enjoyable. I can't even think of a word to describe how awful these are."}
{"text":"Two words..Beer Fries..

They saved my ass today! Lost my wallet there last night, probably drank too much lol..XD
I got a call from a manager this morning and couldn't be happier! I went to retrieve my wallet and it still had its full content!

As far as i know, the BEST DEAL for drinks in the neighbourhood..14$ for a pitcher of homemade Beer, its at least 20 something anywhere else!!

Perfect to go after work with the guys, everything I've tried on the menu so far, a dozen visits, was pretty damn good!"}
{"text":"En promenade dans Montreal, nous avons trouvé ce bar par hasard.
La bière était bonne et les portions de frites très correctes. 
Les frites a la bière sont excellentes !"}
{"text":"Awesome beer, great atmosphere. Didn't order food because we were moving quick but from what we saw come out of the kitchen everything looked awesome. Pub food, in house beers!

Update: went back that night for some dinner and it was on point. Chicken and waffles, highly recommend. Great service as well!"}
{"text":"First spot we stopped at when we wondered around Montreal. It looked like a cool place when we came in, the decor was okay. There were a lot of people inside. 

The waitress nice at first but she came off rude when we asked questions about the menu. My boyfriend ordered a pizza like dish... NOT pizza, she corrected us for calling it a pizza... It was bland. I ordered the classic burger, more like shit burger. It was like a frozen patty that had been cooked until completely dry! They give you the mayo on the side, good flavor. I ate the fries with ketchup.

When we went to pay we paid cash.
 I ordered Canadian money from my bank back home.  The girl ran after me on my way out to say the bill was no good. It was just a later year, (date printed)  but I felt so offended that she would come after me to say I gave her counterfeit money!  AND IT WAS A FIVE$ BILL!

If I could give Zero stars I would!"}
{"text":"This place is ok. The beer is ok, the food is ok, and the atmosphere is ok. The service was pretty bad, but I felt bad for our server because he had some weird tables and his English wasn't great. Meh."}
{"text":"Mediocre food in downtown Montreal. My sandwich was good but obviously the beef was several hours old and my french fries were clumpy (sorta stuck together in one big clump). Most likely they were old too.

The service was quick and friendly and there are several locations. I wouldn't go back, too many other better places."}
{"text":"Stopped at Les 3 Brasseurs on a Saturday afternoon when we were in the neighborhood exploring. It looked like a great spot to grab a beer and a quick bite to eat. The beer was great and the poutine was awesome! The place had a casual sports bar vibe. The bartender was very friendly and even gave us suggestions on where to go out later that night. We thought we had stumbled upon a really unique spot but it turns out this place is a chain. Turns out I also don't care cause it was pretty great!"}
{"text":"Quite an enjoyable bar/dining scene, very vibrant place.
It was packed but we didn't wait for too long fortunately.
Had the LA Wrap with coffee. It was okay but a bit dry in the middle.
Service was good. All and all not the best or my favourite but not too bad."}
{"text":"Tried La Moulin Rouge and it was okay. The place was a bit too packed and noisy though. We'd probably still go back for the beer."}
{"text":"It's  a nice place to drink a beer and eat some poutines, perfect to watch sports or hang out with your friends."}
{"text":"Always really good, i had pizza and my mother in law got smoked meat poutine. The smoke meat was really gross. Sorry...like really gross. And i love smoked meat. my pizza was delish and ceasar salad was good as well!"}
{"text":"This is a mini-chain of brewpubs with several locations in Montreal, all serving the same range of beers. Some of the locations look like they do not brew on the premises, but this location does have a small brewhouse. The dining area is relatively spacious and has multiple levels, so you can probably fit a larger group of people here. If you've been to New York City this place is essentially the Canadian version of Heartland Brewery.

The food isn't anything to write home about, in fact the \"pizza\" that we got had more of a crepe consistency than actual pizza crust, floppy and soft. The salad was standard, again nothing wonderful but not bad either. 

The beers range from light to dark, with a blanche up to a brune (which is more like a stout). I got the 4 beer sampler, but there is also a 6 beer option if you want to try them all. I wasn't blown away by them, but they were consistent and well made. Styles focus more on the Belgian family of beers, rather than the English or American styles. 

Overall I liked everything just fine, but it's nothing I'd rush back for. Part of the reason I like brewpubs is that the food and the beer is unique to that one place. I feel like this place is a chain. The food is bland and unremarkable and the beers, while solid, are something I could find anywhere on tap in any bar."}
{"text":"they used to offer free peanuts which was a plus
Now, only the beer is still a reason.
good for few friends drinking after work."}
{"text":"I came here with my party of 4. Our waitress was so friendly! For drinks, we got classic beer tasters which were perfect! I had the macaroni and cheese sandwich, which was actually the most delicious sandwich I think I've ever had. Mind you, I don't know how much fun this restaurant would be if you were trying to eat healthy- lots of temptations on the menu! All in all, good restaurant. Would return again! (Try the waffle for dessert!)"}
{"text":"We were at the location in downtown Montreal last night for dinner my husband had the leg of lamb which came to the table cold ( my dinner was hot) we sent his back and waited 20 minutes they totally forgot after a few reminders it arrived we were sitting at the bar the bartender said sorry it's out of my hands the bill arrived full price our evening was not a good experience"}
{"text":"Downtown in Montreal, exhausted, thirsty and hungry? Head to Les Trois Brasseurs.

Despite the premium on downtown floor space, this branch has recently expanded even more to hog up almost the entire ground floor of a building. Even at the busiest times, you are guaranteed a short wait, if at all.

The music may be a little overwhelming and the menu a little un-navigable, but hang on and you should be impressed.

First and foremost, the beers. I think that for such a high-throughput and commercialized establishment (they're a chain, after all) they're awesome. I am a fan of the Brown and Red, but that's just my taste. Given time and a bit of food, I'd have a pitcher to myself gladly.

Let's talk food. Their selling point are the Flamms, which I do not find all that special or worth the money. Bruschetta on matzah kinda describes it. It's a pity they put so much focus on them, when they've got some real great dishes on offer.

Take the burgers, which are very tasty, or their salads, overflowing in their abundance. The real show-stopper and wallet-saver, however, is the pork shank house specialty.

Holy Moses, they must have a pork-friendly cornucopia in the kitchen! The shank is huge, delicious and comes with so many sides you'll struggle to finish them all. Foil-baked potato, sauerkraut, salad and God knows what else.

For 12 dollars it's a steal. If that's the House specialty, I commend the house and wish it many fruitful years. Caveat emptor, naturally, as once in a blue moon the shank's porky origin could have been quite fat. 

The homebrew beers make this and all other dishes go down like a charm and I never hesitate going to Trois Brasseurs again and again. 

Yes, the menu is confusing and yes, the variety of foods served can be intimidating. Jut use your common sense and order what a good pub might make in its kitchen, and you will be fine."}
{"text":"I only had the ceasar salad and the wings from the food menu, but neither disappointed. I did try all of the beers, though, and they were quite appeasing. (Minus the IPA, but only because I don't usually prefer IPAs.) And, my favorite of all, was the \"raspbeery lemonade\" beer cocktail. What a neat drink, and it actually tasted good, too! 

But the real reason I liked this place so much was the atmosphere. It just felt good to be there."}
{"text":"Service désagréable. 
J'ai commandé des macaronis au bacon, j'ai eu des serpentini sans bacon. 
Le burger de mon ami était très sec, plus que limite. 
La moitié de mon assiette a été renversée lors du service (là n'est pas le problème, l'erreur est humaine), mais la serveuse a mis une bonne dizaine de minutes à compenser son erreur. 
Nous ne recommandons pas."}
{"text":"A few weeks back I got the most bland-tasting piece of fish I've ever eaten here. Clearly had never been seasoned even with salt or pepper. Not very crispy, literally tasted of nothing. Cost too much for such a low-grade product.
Last night I gave them another shot because my family wanted to go, and I was along for the ride. I ordered a mac n cheese sandwich- tasted like NOTHING. No flavors whatsoever, not even CHEESE. I ordered it with bacon, and it came with none. Another member of my party ordered a burger with blue cheese and got none. Another member of my party ordered a side salad instead of fries...and got fries. Waitress was mostly an absentee. Just embarrassing stuff. 
Don't eat here. Bad food and bad service. 
Maybe drink the beer, it's fine.

Oh! And I forgot- it took us FOUR tries to get English menus. FOUR times the menus were taken away and brought back, and ALL FOUR TIMES they were just French menus. The last time there was one English one mixed in. I can read French but my parents and my brother can't, so they had to pass around a single menu after FOUR attempts. The waitress just kept bringing more French ones. I don't even understand what was happening. Let me repeat, we asked for English menus and the wait staff brought us more French menus FOUR. Different. Times."}
{"text":"Second time at a trois brasseur, first time at this location. Had the sweet honey chicken wings and the classic poutine. The wings were too sweet and the poutine was mediocre at best. It lacked pepper and flavors. Very soggy and the cheese was not fresh. Some servers (not all) were also rude (they were very condescending and  were their rolling eyes as they left). Was with a group, would not come back again."}
{"text":"We went there the ambiance was nice but the food was served close to cold and we waited 40 minutes to get it. The waiter just said he was sorry. We had a choucroute and a flammenkuch, they were'nt good at all. Not only because they were cold..."}
{"text":"Came here with a large group from work. No complaints concerning the service or the decor/ambiance but my steak and fries was pretty disappointing. 

Steak tasted like it had been cooked on a frying pan and not a charcoal grill. It was overdone, dry,  lukewarm and underseasoned. Fries were almost cold as well. I've made better steaks at home. I don't think I'll be returning for the food."}
{"text":"For being in a tourist area no one seems to be very good at customer service. I stood at the bar just to ask a question about if we seat ourselves or wait to be seated. After standing there for 10 minutes no one acknowledge us and I proceed to ask at the bar. The bar tender just stood there and then started helping other people after making eye contact with me several times. 

Very bad customer service. Will never go back."}
{"text":"Super bar, mais bcp trop d'attente pr s'installer.. La terrasse est comme la photo le montre, en hauteur. Faites attention de ne pas avoir le vertige, même pour monter la haut, l'escalier est assez vertigineux ;)"}
{"text":"Three starts because of the customer service. We came here because our hotel concierge recommended this place. We were seated at the bar and the staff behind the bar didn't greet us until a couple of minutes later. And then I had to get up to where the bar tender was speaking with his friend to order our beer. Bad service the staff definitely needs training."}
{"text":"Went for a 5 a 7 with the coworkers. 
Old port yeye
We were 20+ people, so we got good seats in the middle.
Staff was friendly. We started by ordering drinks and beer as other coworkers came late. 
Then, I ordered braised short ribs. 
THE MEAT WAS SO TENDER. I cried. Each bite was heaven. 
Tender meat stole my heart. 
Free wifi, which was great. 
Good time with co-workers. 
Strongly recommend for 5 a 7."}
{"text":"Good beer and food for a reasonable price. We come often. They also have a different beer every month. 
Generally crowed when Canadians hockey team is playing."}
{"text":"Brasseur special flat bread pizza was delicious, blonde and white beer was good too . Nice decor/atmosphere as it was located in old Montreal building."}
{"text":"Came here for some wings with my girlfriend  and decided to order the blue cheese burger and their signature burger. The wings were ok. Burgers were half decent. The patties had no seasoning and their signature burger had no sauce whatsoever.

The only reason I'm giving this experience a 2 is because the service was decent."}
{"text":"Took more than 45 minutes to get an overpriced plate of mussels, half of weren't open. Been in Montreal 2 days and beginning to think A&W is the best restaurant in town"}
{"text":"J'adore les Flamms des 3 Brasseurs. Celui sur Sainte-Catherine a beaucoup d'espace. Il est rare que nous n'y ayons pas de table. Je conseille, pour les grosses faims, de choisir la Formule Duo : vous pourrez manger une Flamms Spécial Brasseur et une Flamms Dessert (ou le café gourmand). Je conseille aussi les salades qui sont très bonnes! :P"}
{"text":"We ducked into this place on a rainy day over St-Jean weekend, and I immediately loved it. The decor reminds me of old belgian bar-restos--lots of wood paneling and leather-topped barstools. The staff is INCREDIBLY friendly (and can smell an anglophone from a mile away) and attentive, and service was quick and efficient.
I had the amber beer, my date has the white beer, and both were really tasty (and cheap!! hooray for Happy Hour!).
I had the Tartine Fruits du Mer, and my date had the \"Manhattan\" Belgian pizza...both were PLENTY of food and very very very tasty.
I highly recommend this place, and you can't beat the location on the vibrant St-Denis!!"}
{"text":"Endroit intéressant pour l'ambiance. La terrasse est agréable l'été. Bon endroit pour leurs bières, mais pas nécessairement pour manger. Les entrées sont correctes, mais les repas principales sont vraiment médiocres."}
{"text":"Stopped here on my first visit to Montreal from Upstate NY. A big part of my travels is to have absolutely no plan at all as to where to go, eat, etc. I'm glad I stumbled upon this restaurant because it was one of the highlights of the trip. We got there right before the dinner rush and was immediately greeted with a warm welcome. I speak English and only a sliver of French and my server was more than accommodating and didn't hesitate to speak to me in English. He conversed with me about Montreal and beers and took our orders. I had the house IPA and pulled pork poutine and both were absolutely astounding. I've never had genuine Canadian poutine and the dish from here really set the bar for me. We watched the evening crowd stumble in and they filled the entire place, I could see why! The bathrooms were pristine and the whole environment was cool and relaxing. Can't wait till I can visit again!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, great atmosphere, quick service. My biggest criticism is it's a bit crowded, but it's pretty justified, the place was full enough that it warranted the seating, but we still got in and had a seat pretty quickly. The food was top notch. I had bruschetta and chicken. It was awesome. I really enjoyed the atmosphere, it felt amazing, and coming here with good company makes for an awesome night."}
{"text":"My husband and I are big microbrew fans and really enjoyed the beers here. Food was great too. The menu also suggests food/beer pairings which was very helpful. My husband had the muscles with the brown, and declared it was the best brown ale he's had. I had the house burger with their featured blonde, which I also thoroughly enjoyed. Afterwards we also tried the white beer, and while it was good, it didn't have quite the depth of flavor as the others.

I had tried to make reservations expecting it to be crowded, but they don't take reservations for only two people. As it was a Friday night, it was very crowded, but they kept things moving pretty well--we ended up waiting maybe 30 min, though could have gotten in sooner if we were willing to sit at the bar. Definitely a place worth the wait though!"}
{"text":"We visited this establishment after a recommendation with a friend. In all honesty I would have rather gone home and cooked my own meal.

We arrived and waited roughly five minutes at the door to be seated. The hostess was very friendly and accommodating (some of our party spoke english only, some french). 

We were seated next to the kitchen doors and our server came, made some beer recommendations and took out drink orders. We were not asked if we wanted water, no forks or knives, napkins were given. 

After about 15 minutes our drinks FINALLY arrived, only delivered by a different server. He gave us our drinks and walked away. We had to call him back to place our food orders. The entire time we were ordering he was rude.He made rude comments under his breath when HE misunderstood what someone was trying to order, when asked to make an order without onions he replied very rudely that \"If it's on the menu than that's what comes on it, We do not make substitutions at all\".

We are roughly a 25 minutes into our dinner experience now. No water, No napkins, no drink refills,  nothing. 

Ten minutes later the awful server returns with place mats, forks and knives. One of our party asks for a napkin as her drink was sticky and making a mess. He turns his mats over to show he has napkins, rolls his eyes and scoffs.

The starter comes, and it was cold. Honestly I wasn't surprised.

Finally our food arrives (brought out by the kitchen staff? not the waiter?). 2 orders of fish and chips (cold), A \"texas burger\" with cold greasy onion rings on top and cold fries, a \"California Burger\" with ice cold fries,soggy bun, and a black slice of avocado. 
I would have complained but surprise surprise, our server was nowhere to be seen.

We finished eating and a DIFFERENT server came to collect our dishes, offered us another drink, desert and coffee. She was very friendly and if I could have tipped her and the hostess I would have. 

I will never be returning to this establisment ever. I will tell anyone who asks about it to avoid it like the plague. I have had a better dining experience at Burger King. 

In short, Terrible food and even worse service."}
{"text":"Les 3 Brasseurs is a pretty average restaurant.  The food's alright, the service is alright, the beer's alright, the atmosphere is alright (as long as you don't mind the really loud volume).  It's too expensive and well-known for what it is, but I wouldn't call it bad."}
{"text":"The sampler of beers were all pretty good.  I thought IPA was best and girlfriend liked the amber best.  The BBQ pull pork poutine came in a cool bowl and was excellent!  Staff was great and knowledgeable...food and beer came out very fast during a busy lunch hour on a Friday."}
{"text":"Tasty beer. Very friendly bar staff..  I quite like the duck confit poutine as well.."}
{"text":"The salads that at downtown locations are very good, are not as good here in the suburbs. Typical. :/"}
{"text":"Came here when the place was not busy. There were plenty of tables near windows and booths available. Couldn't get any of those nice tables for whatever reason. 

Instead were seated in some dark corner near the hall (alternative was to sit near a table with a large group of people). 

Left without ordering the food and will not come back."}
{"text":"Enjoyable experience! Great food, beer and service."}
{"text":"We were in the old part of town and were looking for a place to drink some good beer, eat some decent food, and watch the Montreal Canadians in the playoffs. I read reviews for a lot of bars around the area, and many had better ratings, but when a big game is on you want to go where all the people are and all the people were at Les 3 Brasseurs. 

The place was packed and everyone was glued to the multiple TVs and cheering for their home team. The beer selection was great and their own micro brews were very tasty. I had the 4 pack sample (see photo) to figure out my favourite and surprisingly it was the white beer despite being a dark beer lover. 

My wife ordered her first ever beer cocktail, the Monaco, it was a blonde beer, grenadine, and Sprite mixed. She loved it and told me to take a picture of the menu (see photo) so I could try to recreate it when we got back to the States. I had never even heard of beer with mixers, but when I tried it too, I had to agree it was pretty good. 

For dinner we got the Flat bread pizza and it was also great. It was so light and crispy that it was a perfect compliment to all the beers we were drinking without filling us up. 

The crowd was great and the bar was full, I think despite any other ratings this place has when you are at a sports bar the atmosphere overrides anything else and this place had that and more."}
{"text":"Food ok 
2 of the 4 Burgers were overcooked (and black on the outside) service was really poor don't expect your waitress come by more than once to your table while you're eating if you're lucky!!

To tell you the truth the only good thing was the milkshakes definitely worth going for a milkshake

We also ordered the apple crumble (side note don't order) comes on pizza dough and does not taste very good at all"}
{"text":"The worst food for the price ever. Mushroom chicken is the worst scallopini I've ever had. The house burger is tasteless,  farmer veggies is really some barely defrosted vegs from the supermarket. Even the fries that come with the burger must have been counted per piece, they didn't even fill the plate. In short, the beer might be ok but do not expect to eat well here."}
{"text":"Good food, good beer, awesome atmosphere. We really enjoyed this micro brewery. Try it!"}
{"text":"Hyper aggressive bouncers. Over priced drinks and food. Typical recipe for a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"The first thing your waitstaff will do upon seating you is asking if you'd like to sign up for the restaurant's credit card for a discount on your first meal. When that happened I knew I had made a massive mistake in coming here.

Do you like bland food? Do you like really boring beer? If you answered yes to those questions this restaurant is for you! I don't know how you mess up a sausage and sauerkraut dish but by golly they did it. The Oktoberfest beer tasted like nothing.

This place gets two stars for being pretty neat looking inside and real clean. The waitstaff was friendly (it's Montreal!) and there's tons of room here if you come with a big group.

Voted Toughest Sausage in North America 2017"}
{"text":"Hmm... out of 10 or so reviews, more than half of them are from non-Canadians. That paints a pretty good picture of what Les Trois Brasseurs is like, which is like a Canadian version of TGIFridays (minus the flair). I went to the Vieux Montreal location, which had a really nice patio on the sidewalk. The service wasn't snooty or pushy, although my server did ask me if I wanted an English menu before I sat down (is it that obvious? Maybe my American flag fanny pack is a little too big).

The poutine, which is the main reason I came here, was alright, but not stellar. Maybe it was because I'd never had poutine before and have nothing to compare it to, but it just seems like mediocre fries soaked in gravy, covered in cheese curds. I mean, tasty as hell, but... ten minutes later, do I really want soggy fries smothered in a liquid heart attack? The Caesar salad was redeeming because it came with, as all things Canadian, a hearty portion of bacon. As for the beer, which is brewed on premises, I cannot comment on it, as I foolishly ordered a beer cocktail (peach schnapps mixed with 'La Blanche' - very light wheat and barley malt beer... never again).

Sitting outside probably makes it seem less corporate, for what it's worth."}
{"text":"Usual pub fare..nothing special here. I had the fish and chips and was rather disappointed ;more batter than fish. French fries were no better than the frozen kind that you heat in the oven. My friend had the chicken Caesar salad and she said it was ok .

Won't be bothering to return on next visit to Montreal"}
{"text":"We came here cause we were shopping across the street and heard this place brews its own beer. This place feels like your garden variety tavern-themed casual dining place in style with American restaurant chains such as Bennigans or even TGI Friday. It's busy and bustling with Salt & Pepper video playing on big screens. The food are all \"safe\" picks of American casual food such as cesar salad, hamburger, pizza (YAWN)...
I tried 4 of the beers as they have a little sampler \"Et Cetera\" with glasses with 4 oz; white, blonde, amber (rousse) and brown. The blonde and Amber were not bad for a microbrew, although I think I'll stick with Griffon Rousse."}
{"text":"I have lived in Montreal for several years and every time I come back to the city I do not miss the chance to go to 3 Brasseurs. I prefer this location (St. Catherine/McGill College) but have been to all of them (St. Denis one, Old Port, Crescent, Laval etc). I do not think there has been a single time in the maybe 20-30 visits minimum that I was ever disappointed. No joke. 

Beer is always excellent and they make their own. Any of them would do. My gf loves the beer cocktails they make she always has a few when we go. As for the food, I always love getting the Flammkueche (flatbread pizzas) which are incredible. Has other things as well, such as the chicken skewers, burgers or pork - and again never was disappointed. One thing that they could improve on is their poutine - not the top I've had in Quebec...

All in all - everytime I go to Montreal I must have some 3 Brasseurs - and everytime I leave a happy camper!"}
{"text":"Nice little pub to stop for a quick bite in the old town in Montreal. We had a delicious grilled camembert appetizer which was perfect to share with a beer.
We also shared a Lillouse flammkueche which was good, but not phenomenal.
All in all, this is an ideal place if you are strolling in the area and want to grab a quick lunch, but it is also located in a very touristic area so the quality is standard.
The service was good, the prices were a bit on the higher side."}
{"text":"We come by here every now and then while in Montreal and I've grown to enjoy the place.  There's not much more that can be said about the place that isn't already said.  They have a bunch of house made beers.  Some are bad and others are alright.  This surprises me because of the amount of great local breweries in QC.

The food here is ok.  I tend to stick to the grilled chicken brochettes or LA wrap.  I do like the maxi fries and maxi poutine here but I find they're not consistent with them the maxi fries.

The staff are super fun and friendly and the service is always solid."}
{"text":"We went there after we failed to even get served at another restaurant nearby. At this point, we were just so done, extremely hungry, and cold.

We went into the lobby and saw there were a lot of people, and the hostess was taking down names. When she asked if it was only us 2, she told us to go upstairs and that we would be sat immediately. Awesome !

The hostess upstairs sat us and our waitress came to get the drink order about 5 minutes later, then arrived with said drinks another 5 mins later, by which time we were ready to order. The food arrived super fast, to our extreme pleasure (Only about 15 minutes wait in a CROWDED restaurant) and it was delicious ! I had the Mediterranean salad and it was scrumptious. My boyfriend had the 3 Brasseurs burger, and his fries were hot, crispy and delicious. He also said the burger was great and ordered it without onions, which they complied to (Seems extremely hard for many restaurants to simply take out onions from a burger...).

Our waitress brought us the check as soon as we asked and was smiling and cheerful the whole time.

3B is a little expensive, but the food and service are definitely worth the price !"}
{"text":"Another mediocre brew pub on my trip to Montreal. The beer tasted like...generic beer. Nothing to write home about. I had the amber ale. Meh. 

For dinner, I ordered the burger. The only thing that was enjoyable about it would be the ciabatta bread that it came on. It's always worrisome when the server doesn't ask you how you would like the burger prepared, and, as a result, the burger was overdone. Not helping was the fact that it tasted like a pre-formed thawed beef patty out of a box. Womp womp. 

The portions are also small for the price you are paying."}
{"text":"Endroit très agréable avec une ambiance pub très appréciable !
La meilleure poutine de la ville a mes yeux. Je vous conseille de prendre le supplément avec les frites à la bière, c'est ce qui fait la différence.
Je recommande fortement !!"}
{"text":"There was a mixup between myself and their corporate party scheduler.  I showed up at 5:45 to get ready for my party of 200 at 6.  They were getting ready for a party of 60 at 7!  (if you're reading this, sorry!)

I don't know how they did it, but they got everything ready, my party didn't go hungry or thirsty, and a great time was had by all.  The food is good pub grub, the beer is very good, and the service, having been able to handle that kind of radical change in such a short period of time, was incredible.  The people working that night were all stars, and I can't thank them enough!"}
{"text":"I decided to have lunch there this week with my son.  This restaurant is by far one of the worst eateries that I have gone to.  

It was the first time for either of us.  The hostess sat us down without a word.  We had no idea why she had not given us a menu and waited 20 minutes before I asked a passing waitress if we could have a menu, only to be told rudely that they were already on the table.  You see, the 'menu' is in a form of a newspaper that was folded in two and tucked under the ketchup bottle. We had noticed the 'newspaper' but though it was just that, a newspaper.  The hostess never explained this to us.  

Allow me to add that we arrived after the lunch rush time. We waited another 20 minuted before our waitress came to see us.  I had no idea she was in fact going to be our waitress before she presented herself to us.  You see, our waitress had been 'cruising' the gentleman who was alone at the table next to us.  They ultimately exchanged phone numbers. She was more preoccupied with flirting with him than she was with doing her job.

It wasn't difficult to notice how scantily clad the women employees in this place dress.  I have nothing against sexy attired women, but this was ridiculous.  Three of the four waitresses had tops that were so low cut that I felt very uncomfortable. What is up with that concept ? Looking around I noticed that there were more male patrons than women, and I guess that I shouldn't of been surprised.  My adult son obviously didn't mind their dress code, but then again, he is a man. 

I doubt I will ever go back there again.  The food was quite bland and the decor left a bad taste in my mouth.  My son's nachos were burnt (black) and when we pointed this out to our waitress, she told us that nachos were supposed to be burnt.  Wow ! Really !?  This is not the first time we order nachos in a restaurant. In any case, this place should focus more on food quality than on attracting clients with eye candy. 

If any of you have seen the movie 'forty year old virgin', than you probably remember that scene where the main actor is on a speed date and he constanly tries to close his own shirt as a reaction due to the woman in front of him having a wardrobe malfunction. This is how I felt at the 3 Brasseurs. Definately not suitable for kids !!"}
{"text":"We ate lunch here on New Year's Day when most other restaurants were closed. The food was decent but service was fair. Our waitress forgot to put in our appetizer order which wasn't that big of a deal, but overall not great service."}
{"text":"Really popular. Arrived around 12 am, and filled with people. Ordered hamburger and waffles. Hamburger is not so suitable for me. But waffles are not bad. Great beire."}
{"text":"Great place. Open air seating along the sidewalk and outside. Some tv's in bar but they need more and bigger screens. Food was good. Pretty wide selection of food types. Pizza, burgers, salads etc.. Our server Stefanos M.  was amazing!!"}
{"text":"I stopped by while wandering around town on a Wednesday at 530. I wanted to watch the hockey game that was going on and I wanted some bar food. I sat at the bar since I was by myself. This was really good. I had the peppy chili flatbread pizza. It mentions that it's hot but I didn't taste any spiceyness (which is good - I didn't want too spicy) I accompanied it with a beer sangria. Also really good. The service was fast and friendly. 

It's not award winning but it is good bar food and that was all I was looking for!"}
{"text":"Some of the worst beer I've had in a long time.  Not sure how they continue to sell it.  Run of the mill chain \"micro brew\"."}
{"text":"Visiting Montreal with my friends we decided to stop by this cool microbrewery. Food and brew was amazing!

- BBQ Chicken flatbread pizza
- Poutine w/pulled pork and cheese curds
- French Dip"}
{"text":"Service on the terrasse is next to non-existent. Waited 10 minutes to see a waitress, as we were getting up to leave, one showed up and was surprised we were leaving.

The service on the terrasse is the exact opposite of indoors, where you are served promptly.

IMO if you want to spend time outside, find somewhere else, as you may die of thirst and/or hunger first. if you want to go inside for a drink or a meal, than by all means this place is great."}
{"text":"I come to this place whenever I am in town for business because it is familiar and less formal than most others around but I need to stop that.  The food is ok beer ok but the service is horrendous every time.  Have to wave down help, never get refills. I am not alone as people constantly stop by the bar to ask to pay their bill since no one ever returned to their table. Shame because the place is cool looking but...there comes a time. I guess I need to switch to wine next time in the cite!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere! but kind of disappointed with the poutine. Little salty , not much different with the others I have tasted. Sandwich is a little dry as well. But the service is really good. Had a good time! Also ordered a cocktail, in total almost 40$ including tax and tips."}
{"text":"Grand classique, bonne ambiance, parfait pour déguster les bières de quartier ou manger des plats typiques (Poutine), ou moins (flammenkush, burgers ...)
Le cadre est vraiment top (cuves de brassage partout) et idéalement bien situé dans le quartier latin à deux pas du métro.
Niveau prix c'est correct au vu de la concurrence."}
{"text":"Pretty standard pub food. Actually, compared to others it's above average. Their beer is good(to me at least).

What's bad in this location is the service. The waiter was either ignoring us or had some issues with his English. I ordered sweet potato fries on the side instead of the regular ones which I didn't get in the end. Not a big deal, fries were good enough anyway.

What really annoyed me in the end is that it took 15 minutes to bring the bill so we can leave. You may thing it's cause it's busy but the guy was bringing food to the table next to us serving a whole group of loud people. He didn't even look at us. How much effort would it take just to give us a piece of paper since we were right there. Problem is you can't even go to the bar and pay. I guess that's what I get for being too lazy to drive to Montreal and eat somewhere more decent.

Service: 2 (at least got seated fast enough)
Food+beer: 4"}
{"text":"Excellente nourriture et bière! Mon tartare de saumon était exquis. Pas pour les petits budgets mais vaut la peine. J'adore leur terrasse au 2e étage. On y va pour l'ambiance et la bonne bière! Un must en plein coeur du centre-ville."}
{"text":"I prefer this branch to the one on Crescent. Friendlier staff! Better food! In general I like its atmosphere here better than the other ones."}
{"text":"Another place I visited while staying in Old Montreal.  We were deciding where to eat and a coworker brought up flamucheken when this place was mentioned.  I had never heard of them before so he excitedly decide we must go.  It's a nice pub.  It wasn't very busy the night we went.  The waitress was very nice but wasn't as attentive as I would have liked.  I believe she was covering the majority of the floor though, so I give some leeway here.  The beer, poutine, and flamucheken were good.  I had the sausages and sauerkraut for dinner but was already full from the beer and greasy apps so I didn't make it to far.  It is a nice, unpretentious place to grab a drink and some dinner.  A plus if you like beer."}
{"text":"They have great beers, home-brewed with different distinctive tastes depending which variety you choose. They also have happy hours where the blond and amber beer are on special and they often come out with a special variety monthly.

The ambience is great, very clean and not too noisy. I love the free peanuts, goes well with the beer when waiting for the food.

The food is alright, but the service is just below average. Food comes out pretty slow, and the waitresses rarely come to take away the empty plates or fill my water.

However, it is still a great place to go in groups, but I'd recommend you to go for the beer and appetizers only."}
{"text":"Le restaurant possède deux terrasses. Pas besoin de vous présenter à l'intérieur, seulement aller à l'une des deux et on vous assignera une place (s'il y en a!). Lorsque vous serez bien assis, commandez évidemment une bonne bière ou une sangria. J'ai choisi la sangria exotica qui goûtait un peu trop sucré à mon goût (et j'aime vraiment le sucre)...

Le menu a récemment changé, alors j'ai essayé la flammekueche (délicieuse pizza à croûte très très mince) Campania. Le mélange pizza-pico de gallo-vinaigre balsamique m'interpellait. Ce fût une agréable découverte. Rajoutez du guacamole sur la pizza pour diminuer le piquant des jalapeños (ça paraît bizarre comme ajout, mais le mix pico de gallo, vinaigre balsamique et guacamole est magique!). Mon amie a choisi le quesadillas au poulet. Classique mais très bon. À partager en entrée ou à prendre seul comme repas puisque la portion est généreuse.

Côté service, ça allait. Pas le meilleur, mais j'en ai eu des pires haha"}
{"text":"The beer was above average, but definitely not a top notch craft brewery. Food was mediocre. We ordered the poutine, tandoori chicken pizza, pulled pork sandwich, and a couple of the pasta salads. None of the foods really stood out as exceptional and it was hard to finish everything (not because of the quantity). Of the other options in the vibrant part of Old Montreal, definitely not a place to which I would come back for seconds."}
{"text":"Happy hour until 7 pm! Really cheap specials on drinks and beers! 2 floors and plenty of seats and tables!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised...stopped in because we wanted to try the poutine...menu looked franchise like...and may be.  But the drinks were strong...food was good and service was fast...had the regular poutine and it was delicious.  Gravey was tasty, curds cheesey...then we had the goat cheese flat bread.  That was divine!  Large...very thin crust and tasty...I think it's really a good thin crust pizza...don't know why they call it flatbread...would highly recommend.  Ps...if the owners read this review I would love to put you in one of my stores on south st in center city phila. Penna.   Google it...you guys would be a home run...win win for both of us...may even do a nice fit out for you...message me here if interested...poutine would go over big !!"}
{"text":"This place was fun. As seemed to be the tradition in Montreal the service was slow. The place was pretty empty when we stopped by and the wait staff seemed to be doing their own thing on their own schedule. That's pretty much how it seemed everywhere we stopped in the city. I had the Amber beer they brew (it's a micro brew) and it was great. A full huge pint on a warm day was great. Also tried the blonde which I didn't find as good as the amber ( that sounds awkward). I had a southwest type wrap and once it go out it was VERY good as were the fries. I really enjoyed this place. If you're in the area, find one give the beers a try and the food, they go well together."}
{"text":"I went there during hockey night, the place was really packed. Although since it is not strictly a sports bar, they do say that every CH game is played there on TV.

Given my past experiences with other 3 Brasseurs, I was really amazed by the service, our waitress was very caring and the service was personal.

The Onion Rings was a total rip off, if I were to pay 8$ for merely 6 onion rings, they better be plated in gold, soaked with unicorn blood and deep-fried in Lambda olive oil. It tasted nice, but still, onion rings aren't haute cuisine.

The Smoke Meat Poutine was really tasty, the gravy was just on point and generously poured over their amazing fries. The Sandwich Euro lacked lots of seasoning, and the mayo was not evenly spread.

We waited for almost 15 minutes until our orders were taken, but it happens during a crowded evening."}
{"text":"Nice place, I love the brew pubs, nice friendly staff but oh my the most horrible chicken wings, seriously I'm not picky but this was terrible.  It was all I had but, have anything else, in this case the unknown is far safer."}
{"text":"Service was great. Chocolate brownies were fantastic. Had poutine here for the first time . The beer was brewed on the premises it was great beer along with a lesson on the ingredients that were used to make the beer."}
{"text":"Excellent service,  friendly staff.  No Stanley Stout, no beer of the month, mac and cheese was just noodles with cheese (no sauce) and soggy fries.  Shit food and no beer on site that was advertised, pretty lame, last time I hit this location. Your done 3B."}
{"text":"Come for the beer, leave before the food comes.

I had a hankering for tarte flambé, the Alsatian relative of pizza. I was willing to put my high expectations formed from multiple visits to Strasbourg in check. (You would assume that you could get descent Alsatian food in Francophile Québec...) By any standard, it was awful. Soggy and chewy crust and toppings lost everything in translation."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, friendly staff, good drinks and great food. This is a good location and I love going there. This is the place to go for a beer on a nice summer night. The place is a little small so people are close together and the music is very loud so I wouldn't go there for a romantic date but rather for a good time out with friends. Beer is very good and the food was ok. I tried the flamms (thin pizza) and I wasn't impress at all with them."}
{"text":"Service was slow and the waitress was not friendly at all she looked like she couldn't wait to get out of there. Took forever to get our orders in. The drinks took forever to come and I was surprise the food wasn't up to what I get in the Laval or the downtown Montreal locations. Next time I am in the south shore I will for sure go try another place"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of the Laval location close to my place so when I found myself in the area looking for a place to eat I did not think twice about going there. Again 3 Brasseurs did not disappoint and I am glad I started my evening there as I was taking my mother to the Sugar Sammy show after.

Tried their \"beer of the month/season\" and it was very tasty. It was a tropical beer with a passion fruit and citrus flavour that will make you feel like being beside a beach.

Took the pretzels as a starter to share and it comes with 3 different flavour mustard. Good choice if you don't want anything fried or heavy as a starter and pairs well with beers.

Main meal my mother had her regular choice, the fish & chips, with 1 stick. She said it was not as good as the one in Laval but she couldn't pin point what was missing. I had the squash salad and it was  out of this world. The dressing ratio was great and the squash was cooked and seasoned well. If I want to nit pick I could say that maybe a few more pieces of squash could have been added but that's it. 

Never usually have dessert but 3 Brasseurs always have innovative dessert ideas so dessert is a must. I had a chocolate bomb cake with chocolate mouse covered with warm caramel syrup. All this sweetness came with a side of vanilla ice cream to tons it down a little. Again if I can nit pick the caramel syrup could have been a little warmer.

What made the whole night a great start was the amazing service I received. The waitress was very good and beyond friendly. She told us that this was her 3 rd night working there. I believe her name was Alexandra and if the business see this, way to go on a good pick with this one :)"}
{"text":"Super ambiance! Le restaurant est immense!! Très grande capacité à recevoir du monde. Malgré un pot de poivre cassé sur nos pieds (avec du poivre sur nos bottes d'hiver) par la serveuse un peu dans le rush du travail, tout s'est très bien déroulé avec une bonne écoute des serveurs!"}
{"text":"Malgré le fait que ce soit une chaîne, ce qui enlève le caractère unique du restaurant, c'est une place très conviviale pour y passer une soirée entre ami ou avec sa tendre moitiée!
Il y a souvent du monde (preuve d'une bonne appréciation de l'endroit?! A chacun de juger...) ce qui rend l'endroit encore plus convivial! On est certain de parler sans que le voisin n'entende toute la conversation, ce qui procure une sensation d'intimité préservée.
Très bon souvenir!"}
{"text":"Une petite bière en cette chaude journée !

Comme le menu est le même que dans les autres 3 brasseurs, je ne m'attarderai pas a celui-ci. J'ai pris le wrap au poulet mex et honnêtement je n'ai goûté que le poulet, aucune verdure, pas de goût de fromage, un peu décevant.

Par contre, un gros thumbs up a leur bière en bouteille ' la belle province' une bière ambrée absolument délicieuse aux arômes de sirop d'érable. A essayer !"}
{"text":"Chaque fois que je me lance à aller y manger, je me retrouve déçue.

Points faibles : C'est toujours plein, le service est hyper lent (on comprend pourquoi, je ne blâme pas les employés), la bouffe goûte le réchauffé. 

Bons point :  Il y a de la place sur la terrasse, ils ont de la bière a la citrouille en saison et le jarret d'agneau qui fond dans la bouche. Les spéciaux midi a environ 13$ incluant la soupe (en canne, clairement) et un café."}
{"text":"A great restaurant is the core of downtown Montreal. The decor has a great industrial brewery feel, exemplified by its nice lighting. Lots of space and great for a big crowd. Menu is well stocked and price is decent. I personally got the sausages, which were the best I have ever had. However the accompanying cabbage was horrible. The prize possession of the establishment was the Flamekuchen, which was not all that it was cracked up to be. Considering I went with a large crowd that ordered different kinds of Flamekuchen, I can tell you with much certainly that a Flamekuchen is nothing more than a watered down pizza. But our server really brightened our day. His name was Stefan and was a real fun guy to be served by. Koodos to him! All in all, this place is a great place for a big noisy crowd, but don't expect stellar food."}
{"text":"What a joke!!! Horrible food and horrible service. I know the city was packed that weekend ( July 5th 2014) but if you can't handle busy then don't throw tables everywhere. First, we seat down and after 10 minutes the waitress came in. Took forever to bring our drinks ( only soda) and everything was wrong. The food took near 40 minutes and when finally came in, it was cold, not cooked and all over the place. These people should be ashamed to run a business like this. Many people around us left before finishing their plates, and we did the same. Will never go back and don't waste your time going there either. We left very upset."}
{"text":"Appetizer was good, bruschetta, but the entrees kept coming out barely warm."}
{"text":"This was a bit of a disappointment for me, craft brew restaurants are something I love and try to frequent as much as I can. 
The beers were good not great but the food I ordered was a disappointment. I had to poutine with BBQ beef which is a favorite for me and a real treat when I am home. While I can not say it was bad (it was just ok) it was however cold. When you can't keep gravy and fries hot I wonder what else is not happening in a kitchen, I tend to assume nothing good so probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Good beer that they brew on site...but awful food. 

I got the thin crust pizza like dish...it tastes like totinos frozen pizza in the states. Awful.

Terrible decision on the first night of the bachelor party. Don't waste your time...this is like a Canadian applebees."}
{"text":"I will give their beers 3 stars, but I have had better.
Service is despicable. What is with waiters here who shake their index fingers at you like we are in kindergarten. So rude. They have 1 vegetarian option and it sucked. Don't even get me started on their salad options. Come on people, it's the 21st century. Would it kill you to put a vegetarian friendly option on the menu that isn't iceberg, tomatoes and cranberries? Everything else in Canada is excellent. This place is definitely an exception to that statement."}
{"text":"Even though the food here is not amazing, we come every time we visit Montreal because we really enjoy their beer and their beer cocktails. 

The blonde and the white beers are both very good, light and refreshing. The beer cocktails change each time, but they are pretty tasty and inventive. 

The restaurant itself is in a really convenient location as well, if you are passing through town it is worth a visit."}
{"text":"Les Trois Brasseurs is one of those places I would consider just average.  Nothing really makes you crazy to go back, but nothing is also really stopping you from returning.  

Their beer selection is all brewed locally and they have a full bar for those looking for something stronger.  

The food, which two of us ordered burgers and two sandwiches, was pretty good.  The fries were done nicely and the burger was satisfying.  Their \"signature\" mayonaisse came in a sealed container like fast food joints sauces which was kind of odd.  

Prices were decent, especially given it's \"downtown, St. Catherine\" location."}
{"text":"Always left satisfied with the food and the service. The servers a very friendly and attentive. Food is amazing, steaks are always cooked as asked ! Great place for a casual date or just to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"Very good food and drink on a rainy Tuesday afternoon. Reasonable prices for lunch and quick service from friendly staff who did not poo-poo us when we did not speak French."}
{"text":"This is an OK place to grab bar food and watch the game and hear some decent music. I came here on a Monday night and they had the football and tennis finals on. The food was what you would expect from a bar. The Caesar salad could have done without the bacon and could have used more dressing. The grilled chicken brochettes was pretty good, but you only get two skewers of chicken.  My waiter could have been a bit more attentive after receiving my food, but he was ok overall."}
{"text":"First time in Montreal and stumbled on this place.  Anyplace with extra jumbo kegs in the window automatically gets four stars in my rating book, right?  

WRONG!!!!! 

The service was horrible.  Took almost 15 minutes before the waitress took our order and another 25 before our nachos (with weird picante sauce) and burger (over cooked) & Ore-Ida fries were brought out.  Very lackluster.  Our server was more concerned with bussing tables than her customers. 

The blonde beer was alright but I've had better.  Not impressed."}
{"text":"We stopped in for the Duck Poutine and a beer. This was the forst time I have ever had Poutine and this was absolutely amazing!!!! The Duck was delicious as was the gravy fires and chees curd. Perfection Magnifique!!! 

The beer was excellent well, as was the server. 

Overall this was a great stop for a quik bite in old Montreal."}
{"text":"It took an hour and a half to get our salad and after 1 hr 30 min of waiting for an order of ribs and poutine we gave up and left. Managers were helping to cook which is quite annoying. Supposedly the waitress at the door should have informed us about wait times but unfortunately no one did."}
{"text":"Went here last night and our waiter was terrible. He basically ignored us unless we went out of our way to ask. Food and drinks were good and came out quick so that was the redeeming factor. Wouldn't come here again."}
{"text":"Broad beer selection, mediocre and overpriced food.

Good place to try a variety of beers and maybe have an appetizer or lunch. Would not recommend if you're looking for a restaurant for a good night-out meal.

Definitely ask about any special beers they may have, as there are some that may not be on the menu. I'd go back for the beer if I was in town again."}
{"text":"Our server ended up pouring the same beer a few times in our two flights even though we paid an up charge for the beer of the moment. Slow service. Frozen food. Wouldn't recommend, the beer is completely average and all of the cocktails poured looked half full."}
{"text":"Poutine: Sauce beaucoup trop salée, frite correctes, mais le plus important c'est que le fromage n'est pas frais. Vous avez manquez votre coup, le fromage d'une poutine doit faire scouich. C'est le plus important pour une poutine réussi. 

La bière est bonne, le service est correct."}
{"text":"I am a long time 3 Brewers loyalty card owner with quite a lot of points. I finally write this review after consecutive visits to this place just to avoid any injustice. 3 Brewers is a chain with very good beer and, not fabulous, but decent food. Most of them are recommendable, friendly restaurants. Unfortunately, this branch, which is spoiled by undeserved attention mainly stemming from its central location, definitely a shame to the 3 Brewers brand. Lousy and slow service, terribly managed kitchen, snobbish and uptight managers can easily take the fun away from a lunch or dinner.  Try other 3 Brewers, for instance the one across the Apple Store on the same Rue Sainte-Catherine. You will see the difference."}
{"text":"First off when we got to the restaurant there was a line and I was 5 seconds from walking out the door, but my hunger got the best of me. Needless to say they were very fast at getting us a table and even faster with delivering the food. The drinks on the other hand, we had to remind the waiter twice to get... As I have to follow a gluten free diet I was shocked to not find a single option I could have.. I had to go with my safe bet and get plain salad and grilled chicken... yum... Great atmosphere but would like more options for dietary restrictions"}
{"text":"Wow, in contrast to all the great restaurants and pubs in Montreal, this was the pits.  Service was very efficient, until we finished our meal and our waitress disappeared for the next 20 minutes.  The blonde beer was horrible, almost a sweet and sour taste at the same time.  My wife and I challenged each other to take a swig without wincing and we couldn't pull it off.  I have tried many beers and enjoy microbrews but this was horrible.  Then we noticed a waitress taking the dirty silverware that was collected from the tables, putting them in a pitcher which I assume was slightly soapy water, wiping them off with a towel and putting them back in a tray as clean.  This was not in the kitchen, but on a side table and no rinsing.  The music from the pop videos was so loud, you had to shout to have a conversation, and it was all rap and pop crap.  Overall a really bad experience.  If you want a good pub, try Ye Olde Orchard Pub, great food and service and good selection of beers, both Irish and local."}
{"text":"1. Excellent service. If you have the pleasure of being served by a lovely bartender named Cassandra - then you are in good hands. 2. Great food. The nachos were good, and the 3 Brasseurs burger was delish! I had the blonde beer which went great with the food I got. 3. Free wifi, so if you're a foreigner traveling with their iPhone like me, then this is a great amenity. 4. Great place to watch a game. Of course they're mostly showing hockey, but they have a decent sized screen so you have a great view from most seats near the bar."}
{"text":"Great beer and great atmosphere
We loved this place. Located right in the middle of Rue Saint-Paul in the Old Montreal, this is a very popular tourist destination. The food was delicious, the service was excellent and the beer was fantastic! Strongly recommend!"}
{"text":"The staff was so nice and helpful.  Our food was average, but the beer was delicious."}
{"text":"I will say - their beer is absolutely amazing!!! The food ...... not so much. However, I only had the nachos and you come here for the beer right? Lol 

Therefore, I am going to give them 5  because the beer was worth it! Also, the prices are great! 

We had the amber and I'd go back just for that. However, next time we plan on trying the 10 beer sampler. Just remember to drink responsibly!!! :) 

The nachos we ordered were 1. Overpriced 2. Dry and boring. They charge you extra for the chicken and the guacamole and it's literally like a table spoon of guacamole for $2.75 and a few strips of super thin / dry chicken. DO NO order the nachos!!! 

Beer: 5  
Food: 1  
Service: 5"}
{"text":"Comme d'habitude les 3B sont toujours la pour nous depaner quand on veut manger quelque chose de bien à un prix abordable ! Le restaurant est tres grand et il y a des speciaux à chaques jours de la semaine :)"}
{"text":"Toujours une bonne option avant un spectacle au st-denis ! La bouffe est bonne et la bière aussi ! Ils viennent de renover un étage complet alors c'est le temps de passer faire un tour"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night during labour day weekend, the service wasn't good, but the place was busy. We were seated and it took about 20 minutes until a server waited on us. I had the braised lamb shank and it was okay."}
{"text":"Just went tonight with coworkers as we're staying right in the area, apparently both of them had been here before and thought of it fairly highly. Food was good, I had the lamb shank which was pretty well done for a brewpub. Beer was also pretty tasty as well, especially the seasonal porter and the regular wit. Service was pretty friendly so I would come back."}
{"text":"Have tried both Montreal locations and I will say they are almost identical in quality of food and beer; which is great for a chain since you always know what you will get. 

The atmosphere is nice, very brew pub. They have TV's in the bar and brewing equipment visible through out the place. They also have pallets of bags of malt out in the restaurant, kind of neat to see what they use. Overall the place was clean and all the staff were very friendly and helpful with any questions we might have had. They have menus in either French or English and all their food items have a symbol of the type of beer they recommend to pair the food with.

On to the food, I would say it is fairly normal pub food. They have burgers, flat bread pizzas, sandwiches etc... The few items I have had have been good, nothing to complain about but at the same time nothing to write home about. 

As far as the beer I would say it is so-so. Not bad, not really exceptional, especially since is a brew pub. Their recipes are probably developed for a wide audience since they have so many locations, this probably makes the beer just average since they try to appeal to everybody. They only have about 5 beers which they just call by the style they are; I wish they had more. Would be neat if they had the standard beers and then let the brewer design one or two brews just for their location. Maybe they do and I totally missed it."}
{"text":"Very good pub food! Great server super friendly. 
Comfortable seating and great beer selections."}
{"text":"Food too greasy, way too greasy and waiter seemed in a rush to get us out and not very accommodating my least favorite location out of the ones from
Montreal I've gone to"}
{"text":"This is a great place to grab a few brews when strolling around Old Montréal. 

No doubt it exists for the tourists, but when I visited I'd say I was the only tourist in the entire building. I visited around happy hour and everyone else was wearing business suits/dresses and speaking French. So don't let the touristy location deter you. Apparently nine-to-five Montrealers go here too.

From the outside it doesn't look like much, but it's really impressive once you step inside. Inside, there's a main circular bar, a back room, and even a second balcony level that overlooks the first level. I was surprised to learn that Les 3 Brasseurs is a franchise in Montréal because it doesn't seem like a typical franchise. They did a great job in transforming the old building into a unique, fun, and lively brew pub.

I didn't stay very long because my car's meter was running low, but I would definitely return again. Speaking of parking, be careful with parking on the street. My bartender informed me the city is very serious about ticketing expired meters."}
{"text":"Try the Provençale Flammekueche (flat bread pizza) No meat, It comes with fresh tomatoes, pesto and grated parmesan and romano cheese, pesto (basil, olive oil and garlic). Two people can split one. I have also had the Thai Flammekueche which comes with Chicken, peanut sauce and Gruyère cheese, topped with baby sprouts, 
green onions, red peppers, julienne cucumbers, cilantro and almonds. Very tasty! We ordered the 6 sample beers (about four ounces each) which was fun, and then followed those up 2 full size beers at Happy Hour pricing. Fun and delicious, I highly recommend this location if you are searching for some good food and drinks at reasonable pricing in a good atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Les 3 brasseurs est plus une solution de rechange lorsque tous les autres restos à proximité sont pleins. Chaque fois que j'y vais, je suis déçue de la nourriture. Souvent les plats sont fades, secs, bref n'ont rien d'extraordinaire et absolument tout d'ordinaire. Lorsque j'y suis allée hier, c'était encore pire. Sur 6 personnes, seulement 2 ont apprécié leur nourriture (des flamms....seule bonne option du menu me semble-t-il). Mon wrap aux légumes grillés ne contenaient que 2 ou 3 minuscules morceaux de poivron et où étaient les avocats? Pire sandwich que j'ai pu manger dans ma vie. Je préférerais encore avaler un sandwich de la cafétéria de l'université. Mon amie qui a pris la tartine aux fruits de mer a été atrocement déçue elle aussi... Son plat avait l'air d'une grosse \" toast \" garnie de câpres, de saumon fumé \" cheap \" et de 4 ou 5 crevettes surgelées... Pas fameux! Côté bière, tous ont cependant bien aimé. J'avais opté pour la sangria blanche et encore là, j'ai été déçue. Mon verre ressemblait à un mélange fluo de jus en poudre. Disons que ce n'est pas la boisson que j'avais en tête. 

Parlons service maintenant : queeee c'estttt lent! Nous avons dû attendre un bon 20 minutes avant que la serveuse vienne prendre nos commandes de boissons. Puis, un autre 20 minutes pour la nourriture. Ensuite, 25 à 30 minutes pour que la nourriture arrive. Finalement, presque 30 minutes après que nous ayons fini nos plats, nous avons dû aller chercher la serveuse pour qu'elle prenne notre commande de desserts. Beaucoup trop de temps d'attente additionné pour un restaurant aussi...boff. C'était bruyant et la musique était digne d'un club à 2 h du mat'. 

Mes 2 étoiles vont à la serveuse qui, malgré sa lenteur, était gentille et n'hésitait pas à nous recommander des plats (nous aurions peut-être dû l'écouter!)."}
{"text":"The waiter we had was great. The food was ok... We were hungry so easier to please. This place is perfect for gathering for beer and finger foods. Not really much more than that..."}
{"text":"Pretty lame service (girl who just cleans behind the bar could stand to smile once in a while), overpriced drinks, none of the beer is really good, the beer cocktails were so weak, and even though they only have 6 beers they were out of one.  Great location though."}
{"text":"Si vous avez soif, si vous souhaitez être servi promptement, alors c'est pas ici que ça se passe!   Cela appris au moins 10 minutes pour prendre notre commande (bières seulement.... \"la bouffe madame c'est tantôt\", m'a t-on dit) 30 minutes plus tard les bières sont arrivées.... et c'est seulement là que nous avons pu commander à manger.... 
Les bières étaient bonnes... mais le service pourri!"}
{"text":"I came here with a big appetite after a spa day and was not disappointed! Simple but charming terasse with plenty of outdoor and indoor seating. There are daily drink specials - Mondays- 12.50$ for a pitcher of sangria! (Although that's not what I ordered for a one person meal!) I had a pint of their  amber brew to kill time considering it took forever to get our food.

Along with my friend, we tried:
1) Siracha burger with a side of poutine (freshly prepared beef patty with a toppings and a kick of siracha mayo!)So good and really hit my hunger pains

2) New on the menu - chicken and waffle burger with a side of a house salad. Yes a piece of fried chicken in between morning breakfast goodness! It was an interesting combination of sweet and savoury although a tad dry on the meat and the waffles were overdone.

3)chicken wings with sweet and sour sauce - served with 8 pieces and a blue cheese sauce. But no veggies on the side :( ok for finger food.

All that came out to 30$ each :). Altogether a happy camper!"}
{"text":"Des très bonnes bières, des portions généreux, burguers appétissants. Excellent pour fêter avec la 'gang', même si vous avez des enfants."}
{"text":"This was a great place. The amber beer was awesome. The service was good & the place was clean & it had a good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Good food with quick service. Their pizza was good and different. Super thin crust and no tomatoe sauce. Very enjoyable."}
{"text":"It took a painfully long time to be seated on a Monday night, despite there not being a lineup. 

Good brasserie. However, in terms of the food:

The tuna tartare starter: just okay. Not extraordinary. Could have used more lemon or lime. 

The brie and pear sandwich was disappointing to say the least. The fries were great. 

Pros: our server was fantastic, fast, and very courteous. The fries were good. The prices and portion sizes are good. I tasted my dining partner's goat cheese burger and it was amazing.

Cons: extremely noisy, brie pear sandwich was a flop. May be busy on a weeknight."}
{"text":"Great food, great drinks and great service! Their relaxing and enjoyable atmosphere make 3 brasseurs a must come for me every time I visit Montreal. Their beers are brewed in house and differ depending on location. As well, their menu changes ever so often which allows for a new experience every visit. Overall, a great place to grab delicious food and drinks after shopping at Centre Eaton. Recommend trying their popcorn shrimp appetizer and their flammekeuches as the main course. And of course, try their in house blonde and amber beers!"}
{"text":"I had the Pulled Pork Poutine. It was good service and not a long wait. The food portion was a great size. The taste came with a pack of flavours that just burst in your mouth. It was delicious and it definitely filled my appetite. Thanks Les 3 Brasseurs for a great meal!"}
{"text":"Sometimes you go to a restaurant and the food is so-so but the customer service blows you out of the water and you overlook the slop on the plate.  Or you have great food but the service is really weak and does not create a memorable customer experience.  I lived the dream of so-so food and mediocre service.  Now mind you they were friendly but I would never confuse you with being someone good at their job.

Huge place but with a bit of an echo due to the many empty seats.  I now understand why.  I waited dutifully at the hostess desk to be seated.  After 5 minutes gave up and went to the bar.  Got my drink reasonable quick and regrettably, my food came shortly after.  

Brie blue burger and a side of poutine.  If I just read the menu it was a 5.  I tried my food and at best 2.5 but merited a rounding down versus up.  he supposed creamy blue brie was cool, not melted and lacked flavour.  The chunk of beef, while well cooked, lacked flavour.  The poutine was very week.  Tasteless gravy, a few cheese curds and so-so fries.  After my plate was plopped down on the bar, no one asked if I wanted anything else and heaven's forbid they should ask how was my meal.

Impressive selection of beer.  It would be even better if they filled the glass."}
{"text":"The food here is average, but I'll go once in a while. If I do eat, I'll order a flammekueche and I'm never disappointed with that. I can appreciate a good home-brew like their blonde beers or their miniature 4oz glass testers (comes in 4 flavours). During the holidays they tend to come out with interesting concoctions too. 

That being said, like any chain restaurant, it loses its touch and flavour quickly. I prefer the ambience of smaller, less generic, unique places... so I don't come here often, it's usually a last resort if other places are too packed or closed."}
{"text":"No one to seat us while we were waiting at the entrance. Walked in and took a seat and got a lecture from the server, who was kinda a bitch the whole time. Food was ok. A bit overpriced. Would likely never go again."}
{"text":"Great beers, and awesome bar tenders! Definitely check them out for their delicious food, prime location, and awesome brews!"}
{"text":"Amazing prices. Good poutine, and a great beer selection! I got a flight which was a great chance to taste a lot of the beers. My boyfriend got a 36 oz IPA which ended up tasting a lot like an amber ale, we actually thought they messed up the order at first, talked to the waitress and she ended up repouring the same beer.
It was a decent beer, just not what an IPA should be! They also let me make a substitution on my flight which was nice. We got the waffle for dessert, highly recommend! Solid place for food and drinks, especially if you are looking for good deals. We were amazed at the food and drink prices there. We got all of our drinks and food for $26 USD! Insane. Coming from Boston, that is unheard of. We were pleased with our experience!"}
{"text":"Service atroce, bouffe très moyenne et bière ordinaire. À éviter! Nous étions un groupe d'à peine 20 et nous avons attendu 2 heures pour nos repas. Ridicule."}
{"text":"This place is huge. It's comfortable and clean with a nice atmosphere. The food is great. The portions are generous. The service is not the best but it's acceptable. The beer is what this place is known for. Always fresh and great! The prices are slightly high but you certainly get what you pay for. This place is perfect for a quick beer with food or for a fun outing."}
{"text":"We weren't too picky, as few places could accommodate a party of 8 at lunch, but it wasn't bad. Our server was very friendly, the beers were good and the tandoori chicken flamm hit the spot. All in all, there are worse ways to spend an hour people watching."}
{"text":"Yes this is a tourist spot, I call it Canadian TGIF but so much better.  They are my go to quick bite place.  I mean let's not mistake this place with Au Pied de Cochon but those who writes the negative reviews think this is a haute cuisine place.  It is a pub and they have great beer selection and good pub food that goes well with it.  I think their pub food is much better than your regular pub food in the states.  The Fram..... don't know how to pronounce it but it is like flatbread pizza and their sausages and burgers are great for what it is.  The place is always packed with tourists and the staff tries to keep up with the flow but I know sometimes it can run behind especially with big parties.  I always can count on this place for good beer and good pub food."}
{"text":"If you're looking to drink fresh beers and have no other wants, I guest this place will fulfill all of those goals. Great location. We usually stop by to drink one beer and eat a poutine... Their poutines have crispy fries and the sauce doesn't taste too much the concentrated meat, but rather has a light appearance and taste. I must say, the service is o-kay. They take themselves too seriously, there's no humour (but wait, I haven't rated them on this aspect). Last times we went there they had a hard time delivering what we have requested. We have asked there be no cheese in the salad and they forgot. We requested a vegan meal, they brought a meal made with cheese... Perhaps they should teach their staff what the word 'vegan' means. And they do take a while to serve you. Giving it a three because we definitely have other bars in Montreal that will serve you better."}
{"text":"I think they're pretty good for a franchise that's literally everywhere. It's super convenient and familiar to go into Les 3 Brasseurs. I noticed their vegetarian menu wasn't very diverse - most of them had goat cheese and vegetables on them, it just depends on whether you want it in a sandwich or in a pizza. I've ordered their goat cheese and tomato (I think) sandwich, which was quite good, but the sandwich wasn't flavourful. The fries were pretty great though. Their beer is pretty good, anywhere that has beer from tap has a soft spot in my heart. I got their blonde beer, which went well with my food. Their menu was pretty thorough when it came to the beer - what it goes well with, the alcohol percentage, how bitter it is, etc. It also has little signs next to the food menu to let you know which beer goes well with each menu item, which I thought was pretty cool. Their service is relatively slow, mostly because it's always so crowded and they don't have enough servers. Don't expect to get your food right away."}
{"text":"This is like the equivalent of a TGI Friday's for me...but its old town location gives it a lot more character than a Chili's would have in the States.  I came here on my first night in MTL and ordered their Light Blonde beer, a regular poutine and a smoked meat \"Flamm\" (a very thin crust pizza with a cream sauce).  The place was packed for a hockey game, despite this we grabbed a table right away and a lovely waitress greeted us quickly.  She brought us English menus and drinks right away.  The beer was good and the poutine (with maxi fries) turned out to be my favorite during my stay!  And I did my share of poutine tasting....from super high-end to not so much, and this one took the prize (sorry French-Canada!).  The Flamm was not my favorite, but the beer and poutine filled me up, so it wasn't a big deal.  If in a bind for a place to dine, this is not a bad bet.  It really doesn't feel so chain-like."}
{"text":"The epitome of disappointing. I ordered nachos and never received them. I was the first to order and this was the only thing I ordered. My friend ordered the steak and mushroom pizza and it was dry, bland and cut into odd shaped slices. Another friend ordered a plain burger that came in the form of a hockey puck in both flavor and consistency. We had to flag down a server to get someone to take our drink order. Sure, it's Thursday night. It's fairly busy. So is every other restaurant and I will take my friends and we will spend our money someplace that knows how a restaurant should be run."}
{"text":"The IPA is not an IPA. Something went wrong. Tap lines crossed maybe? Tastes yeasty and Belgian. No hop character at all. Cool building. Pretty waitresses..."}
{"text":"Je ne suis pas trop fan des 3B anjou. Bien que la bière soit bonne, et la nourriture correct, le service n'y est pas toujours. On dirait qu'ils réduisent le personnel aux alentours de 21h du soir. De plus, j'y ai été 3 fois cet été une fois un mercredi et deux fois le vendredi et la terasse sur le toit est toujours fermé. Dommage..."}
{"text":"They have their own micro-brewery. The beers are really nice. Had an amber and an ale.
The food was great."}
{"text":"I sometimes get dragged here by co-workers. Average beer (sometimes served too warm), variable quality food (fries are always yummy though), slow but friendly service. 

Sometimes the floor vibrates; it's irritating."}
{"text":"The white beer is great.. it's a nice place to hang out .. the staff is really nice .. it was good to have conversation with the staff while having my beer alone .. kudos to having a great staff .. they brew their own beer .."}
{"text":"Nestled in Old Montreal this is a bit hard to find. We went on a Sunday afternoon and it wasn't too crowded. The same menu as all the other Brasseurs. Their beer selection is brewed on site. Our waiter was nice but we felt ignored once the order went in. I had a beer cocktail that wasn't that great but my friend enjoyed his beer. The poutine flatbread was not that great. It came out really fast and just didn't have the same nice taste as the one we tried earlier in Quebec. The menu is also pretty limited. It's fun to stop in and get a drink but I wouldn't return for dinner."}
{"text":"If it comes down to Les 3 Brasseurs or Hurley's, which is right down the street, I'll pick Hurley's every time. This place is very generic and unexciting. The vibe is mediocre at best, the food is ordinary and lacking in flavor and the service is more or less non-existent. Also, somewhat overpriced. Not for me."}
{"text":"Stopped by her for drinks randomly while roaming the city. Definitely has brew-house feel to it which is pretty cool. Didn't try much food outside of the nachos, which were ok, but again my tunnel vision was set on the beer. The blonde belgium pale ale was pretty good and extremely . The blonde tasted like a light version of leffe blond. They also had these beer cocktails which were an interesting twisted on a typical brew house like beer & whiskey, beer & grenadine, and some other odd mixtures.Overall the place is pretty good and the servers were really nice  and were pretty attentive."}
{"text":"Lively place with a lot of rooms, spills out on the sidewalk.    A nice place to sit after wandering 10 miles through the city on my first trip to Montreal, very much a pub feel with the menu to match.  I had the most egregiously offensive item on the menu: Poutine Flamkucken!    A large thin pizza piled with fries and gravy.   Why not stomach the most touristy pile of calories in the whole place?  The staff seemed very busy but they kept up with the drinks and pace well."}
{"text":"Sometimes after shopping, you just want a place that has somewhat predictable, yet delicious food. This place fit the bill. I had a Beet and Shrimp salad which was really, really good. The house red wine - a Malbec - was also really tasty. 

My companion had a burger, which he enjoyed the hell out of. Also had a beer flight, which was no Dieu de Ciel (more on that in another review), but it was quite tasty.

This place is one of those reliable, unadventurous places with pretty delicious food. For what it is, it's very enjoyable. It's just what we wanted on this day, and I'd go back."}
{"text":"We were only in Montreal for three full days (the half days that included travel don't count in my mind), yet there are two restaurants that we frequented twice. The things they have in common? Delicious [insert item here], terrible service.

So, Les 3 Brasseurs was a random stop. We were wandering the beautiful cobbled streets when we realized we were hungry. We started to incorporate menu perusing into our wandering, and the menu here caught our eye, not only for the food (which was blessedly lacking in the poutine arena), but also for the beer.

We chose to sit outside, which probably wasn't very smart. The patio is small, and they squeeze way more tables and chairs out there than is advised. I watched several couples in the aisle next to us passive-aggressively bumping chairs into the patrons at the table behind them. It wasn't the customer's fault, really. The restaurant should have known better than to try to fit 30 tables and chairs into a space that could only really fit 20 on a good day.

At any rate, both times that we stopped here, we chose to sit outside. I do love to people watch. I found the waitstaff to be lacking on both occasions, but what the heck - we were there for the booze. 

My husband absolutely fell in love with their L'Ambree (American amber/red ale) - it was the only thing he ordered on both visits. Meanwhile, I wanted to try as much as I could, so I started with the Brune (brown), then moved on to the Blanche (white), before trying the seasonal brew, the Summer Fresh Raspberry Ale. 

Wow, that makes me sound like a lush. I'll have you know this was over the course of two visits, thank you. I'm just not divulging how many of each beer I tried. =)

The Blanche was by far my favorite. It was smooth, with a light citrus flavor. It wasn't an overly wheaty wheat beer, if that makes sense. I don't know how else to describe it. The Brune was also very good - it had a deep, nutty flavor without being too heavy or having too overpowering a finish. My least favorite was the raspberry ale. I did like it, but not nearly as much as the other two. I had expected an overpowering raspberry (or at least sweet) flavor, but it never came through. That might be good - I would expect a raspberry flavor to dominate the beer itself - but I was looking for at least a hint of sweet or raspberry. It was, however, a very light and refreshing beer, perfect for a hot and sunny day on the patio.

Both times we went, we went light on the food ordering. Our first time there, we shared the charcuterie platter and an order of the beer mussels. It took for-freaking-EVER for the food to get to us. We were both on our second beer by the time the plates hit our table (and feeling it, too...or maybe that was just me?)

While the food was decent, it certainly did not make sense that we waited over 40 minutes for a small board of meat and cheese and a plate of mussels. To add to the mild frustrations (mild because I was tipsy by then), the waitress never once came by to check on us, or to give us an update on our food. Not that I needed a play-by-play, but knowing that our food wasn't forgotten would have been nice.

Our second time there, our waiter coldly told us that we'd have to order something to eat if we wanted to stay on the outdoor patio - apparently you couldn't just drink beer out there. That was fine, as we were once again planning on a light snack, but he absolutely could have phrased in a nicer tone of voice.

That time, we each ordered a Caesar salad, which again took much longer to come out than I would have expected. I also never expected to get bacon on my Caesar. I should have read the menu a bit closer, I guess. I love bacon, it just was not what I was banking on when I placed that order, so ever piece of bacon from my plate ended up on my husband's. He was in heaven.

So yeah - service not so great, but that beer, though! My husband still says that if they exported that amber, he'd buy it by the case. I kind of feel the same way about the Blanche."}
{"text":"Jeeeeez where to begin

The best part was our waitress she believed in the place and loved her job.

3 L blonde beer 23 dollars ...awesome 

Food was terrible I mean terrible fries salad burger everything was just disgusting. The burger tasted off and my friend got sick. Cheese was funky. Calamari was mostly oil and batter no calamari felt like a bucket of grease after eating that.

Honestly only reason I came here is because I left the eaton centre and it was raining and we wanted to have dinner and drinks. I would give them 1 star but our poor waitress was so kind and sweet and very professional ANICK was the best part."}
{"text":"Ugh.  Awful.  Awful.  Service - HORRIFIC.  Food - BAD.  Enjoyed every minute of dining & service in Montreal, until tonight.   Average 25% tip.   Gave 15, and they deserved l"}
{"text":"J'aime bien. Malgré le fait de que ça soit une chaîne, on le ressent pas quand on y est. La bière est bonne, et le varlet (1L de bière) est à un prix abordable à mon avis (vers 9$ et quelquechose). J'aime bien la terrasse en été, mais il faut commander à manger pour y être. Par rapport à la nourriture, les nachos peuvent sembler un peu chers mais l'assiette est très grande! (Très bons aussi). Aujourd'hui j'ai mangé ici avec mes parents et ils ont bien aimé, et on a commandé les saucisses avec la choucroutte (3 saucisses, un bon repas) et les fish and chips (2 bons morceaux de morue). Une experience satisfaisante! Les serveurs ont été aussi sympas avec nous."}
{"text":"Un classique, bon, pas trop cher, on ne peut pas être déçu
Cool pour regarder les matchs aussi, et même rencontrer du monde car c'est bonne ambiance, décontracté..
Bien situé et bons horaires, lorsque tout est fermé autour..."}
{"text":"Les Trois Brasseurs is where I had poutine for the very first time.  It was a medley of flavors on a plate that really shouldn't have gone together so well--French fries, gravy and cheese curds--but came together in perfect harmony.  Mike had promised I'd enjoy it and I did despite my initial skepticism.  Overall, the restaurant is a fairly standard microbrewery with great food and people-watching.  I would definitely be interested in returning."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place because we just didn't know where to eat when we arrived in Montreal.  From the looks of it, it's your typical chain restaurant serving bar food and some pub-like cuisines.

Seems ok for a lunch spot as the locals poured in at noon on a friday.  Prices are a little steep for mediocre food.  Beer of the month was warm, but i think that's how everyone in Canada likes it?"}
{"text":"I went to here with my friend for some lunch after class because it was close to her work. I was craving French fries like usual so this seemed like a good place. I ordered the goat cheese tartine with beer battered maxi fries. The fries were awesome but when I decided they would be awesom-er with mayo all the staff seemed to disappear into the kitchen :(. When our waitress finally appeared she brought me back dijonnaise. I wish it was plain mayonnaise but she didn't give me the option... The tartine was good and not too heavy, my friend had some popcorn shrimp which were awesome as well and came with a spicy sauce. We also had their beer of the moment which had an apple taste. I would definitely like to return to try their yummy sounding burgers. I liked the decorations and the waitress was friendly, this would be a good place to go with a group of friends to have fun, eat some food and try a bunch of beer."}
{"text":"Decent place to go for dinner. Their food it pretty good, although the vegetables always taste very musty to me.
The beer is always good, even though you can only get their microbrewery beer. The seasonal beer are something I always like to try. 
Definitely go for their happy hour 5$ pints!"}
{"text":"The beers are made on premises (as the smell of yeast will immediately tell you) and the atmosphere can border on overly loud.  The food is generally good, with the Flamms (flatbread pizzas), poutine and beer-braised pork shank among the winners.  The one on St. Catherine's tends to be a little less crowded than the one near the Bell Centre."}
{"text":"Went back yesterday, for dinner. This time, the place wasn't so full. It was a nice day so we sat outside. We were seated immediately and greeted by a very pleasant server who asked if we wanted drinks and promptly informed us of the Happy Hour specials. We ordered drinks and no appetizers. A few minutes later, she came back with our drinks and asked if we were ready to order. We placed our order and settled in to our drinks and pleasant conversation. Not too long afterwards our meals arrived. As before, the food was great. We also noticed that management was covering the floor, keeping an eye on service flow and ensuring all bases were covered. 

As far as I can tell, Manager was correct the first time we came by. This team makes every effort to ensure that guests have a great experience. On this visit, they were all conscientious, customer focused, pleasant and on top of every detail. It felt as though the team was working together, and that staff was focused on the right task at the right time. Very different from our first visit and a great experience overall!"}
{"text":"I was there yesterday with my husband and his friend. I have very few regrets in my life and the Mac & Cheese sandwich is one of them. It sounds great on paper, but it's just gross in real life. The glass of coke was good though, and everyone else seemed to enjoy their food. 

If you like generic carby food, this is the place to go, but I couldn't emphasize enough that you should stay away from the Mac & Cheese sandwich."}
{"text":"Les 3 Brasseurs is a Canadian chain restaurant that has two locations in Montreal, one on the famous Sainte-Catherines Street and the other location that we tried, Sainte-Paul Street in the Old City.  The reason for our choice on this freezing sub zero winters night was simple, it was one of the only places actually open that was serving food. 

When we arrived it was pretty full with people and resembled a neighbor hood bar where everybody knows your name. There was old time memorabilia on the walls and lots of Canadian sport themed decor including the shirts on the waitstaff. We were seated quick in a small corner along the wall beside the bar with a great view of the kettles inside the on site brewery which was pretty cool to see. 


First, we placed our drink order. Simone had water and I decided on a Sangria ( which is popular in this city for some reason) The menu looked liked an newspaper and was even called The Gazette. I thought this was a nice touch to the ambiance of the place. My drink arrived and was very well balanced in flavor and fruity. 


For our appetizer we decided on (of course) Poutine. Although it looked great, when it arrived at the table, I was a bit disappointed in my choice. The fries were not fresh cut, and the gravy was overly salty.  It was still real cheese curds and the dish was okay, but not great. I probably would pass it over next time, as you can find much better Poutine in Montreal ( see my other review for Montreal Poutine).


Simone chose for her entree, Chevre Chaud with Greens. This was an open faced sandwich consisting of two slices of French Bread topped with Goat cheese and Tomato Bruschetta, served with a mixed green salad with Herb Dressing. It was good but the Tomatoes were a bit over powered with all the cheese.  Simone was able to finish all of the salad, tomatoes and bread , but had to scrape some of the rich goat cheese off from the dish.


My choice for an entree was the 3 Brassuers Sauerkraut. The dish consisted of a German Bratwurst, a Frankfurt Sausage (AKA-big hot dog) a thick slice of Grilled Ham, Broccoli Crowns, a Boiled Potato and a large portion of Beer Brined Sauerkraut.  I couldn't actually taste a difference between the Hot Dog and The Bratwurst which i found a bit troubling, but both were good. The Grilled Ham was average and the same you could find in any supermarket. The Potato was about as taste less as a potato can be, and the Broccoli was fresh but only luke warm. The absolute star of this dish was the Sauerkraut which i used to top every item on the plate. It was delicious and I wish the rest of the dish measured up.


In addition to my meal, I also tried one of the 3 Brasseurs Micro Brews. I decided on the Blonde Beer. Although the description said fruity and light with a refreshing aftertaste, i didn't find it to be any more or less enjoyable then the bottle of Labatts I have in my fridge. So i guess the moral of this story is that a chain restaurant in Canada is kinda like a chain restaurant in the U.S. The food was average, the beer was average, the ambiance was above average.  Overall, i'll give Les 3 Brasseurs a half-hearted three stars, but if I have a choice I think I'll stick to the independent establishments next time. ***"}
{"text":"Pros: easy to spot, clean, decor is pretty nice. 
Cons: terribly slow service and meh beer. 

It's basically a place to dive into when you can't find anything better or are too tired to make it to a better place."}
{"text":"I was looking for a good micro brewery in Montreal and this place was it.  The beer here is excellent but I have to say the food could've been better.  The thin crust pizza is a little bland and not as fresh/hot as it should be. The fries were oilier than I preferred.  The atmosphere here is very nice.  They have a bar area where you can have your lunch and interact with the fellow patrons.  Its also great for large groups especially if your friends like beer and are loud.  I had a pint of their brown ale and it was excellent.  Try their \"et cetera\" which gives you 4 beers to sample."}
{"text":"I got a poutine and the fries were horrible. They were hard and tasted like wet potatoes. The service was very underwhelming.

I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Summary: lol wtf is this sh*t?

Full Re-of the-View:
First off nobody noticed us waiting to get seated for what felt like forever, the place wasn't super busy either so no excuse there, unless they want people to walk out...hey maybe they wanted to save us the torment of eating there? We should have taken the hint, but we didn't. 
Bummer.

Seated, a miracle!
One drink got ordered by the hubster, I hadn't decided yet *shrug* figured when the waitress comes and gives him his drink I will know what I want and be able to order it.
Nope.
She runs past our table smacks his drink down without saying a word and storms off again. 

Eventually I get to order my drink and some food too (gasp!), I went for the roast beef sandwich and the well-hydrated dude across the table went for the quesadilla. 
BLAARRGGHH! 
Do these people not know what seasoning is? Or hell salt even?
Bland, hard, yuck. 
If you make mushrooms and beef bland you have failed at life, simple as that.
The quesadilla looked worse than your average Taco Bell disaster but at least it had some sort of flavour..nothing good, but hey you can't ask for miracles in this place (like edible food and decent service).
Our waitress had gotten lost at this point and we wanted to leave, so we had to poke the barman in order to pay for our \"food\" (ha! food..).

Oh! I forgot to mention that my fries contained one really old \"bottom of the fry basket for the last 10+ batches\" black fry, yay! I left it triumphantly sticking out of the mayo for them, as the fry equivalent of a middle-finger, it was the least I could do. 

Why do people go here???"}
{"text":"Since they brew their own beer here I was motivated to order the blonde, it was light and smooth! To keep things traditional we ordered the poutine and added the beer battered potatoes to it, and it was great! For the main course I went with the beef sandwich which was also very savory and flavorful and a guarantee that you will not leave there hungry. The only thing the service is very relaxed, thus you'll need a minimum of 1 1/2-2 hours to enjoy your meal."}
{"text":"C'est une chaîne, donc il faut juger comme tel, le menu n'est pas extraordinaire, mais il fait la job. J'aime bien la terrasse de cette succursale, avec la vue sur le quartier latin.
On y va quelques fois par année puisque c'est près de mon travail, et aussi parce qu'on sait que les enfants y sont bien accueillis malgré l'aspect brasserie du restaurant (un bon compromis pour un souper festif avec des enfants).
Personnellement j'apprécie leurs bières, j'aime bien essayer les bières de saison donc je ne prends rarement la même."}
{"text":"Il s'agit d'une chaine, ce qui a pour avantage de savoir qu'on ne paiera pas un prix de fou pour de la nourriture très bof comme c'est le cas dans certains restos du vieux.

La bière est soit détestée, soit adorée, dans mon cas elle n'est ni un ni l'autre, ce qui n'est pas mauvais non plus.

Niveau nourriture on parle principalement de junk, mais il y a moyen de manger santé tout de même. J'aime bien leurs tartines.

La terrasse est très intéressante, quoique leurs barreaux ne sont pas fixes (il ne faut pas s'y appuyer), et il y a parfois des parasols qui attaquent les gens.

Mon plus gros problème avec cette franchise est le service qui est plutôt décevant. Je leur accorde le fait qu'ils sont débordés vu leur emplacement, mais il y a tout de même moyen d'offrir un service plus cordial que ce qu'ils offrent."}
{"text":"While visiting Montreal, we ventured from our nearby hotel to catch some food and drink in a busy part of town. The atmosphere on the patio with nearby bars and restaurants make it a wonderful spot to visit. The food was excellent and the home make brew/beer is just as good! This is a great spot to people watch on a hot summers day!"}
{"text":"Not my favourite place, but it's alright. The beer is served quickly. The food, not  so much. The best thing I tasted here was the beer battered fries. All the rest was just OK. The hamburger was not of great quality and made me feel a bit nauseous for a a few hours. I asked for BBQ sauce and by the time I got it  my fries got cold (yes, I like BBQ sauce with my fries). The waiter was really nice and got me a new small portion of fries even though I didn't ask for it (but after I politely declined his suggestipn to re-heat my fries... what? who re-heats fries?). Otherwise, the beer is OK but I don't really like huge places like this one."}
{"text":"Service was a little slow at first, but improved. Beer selection is great. Had the Thai flatbread, which was good. Delicious beer battered onion rings. Large and comfortable restaurant."}
{"text":"We had traditional sauerkraut, cassoulet,and snacks with beer for lunch. Beer is good but the food is a bit overpriced. The cassoulet looks like smaller than menu."}
{"text":"I sampled three of their beers, the saison, the IPA and the blonde. I found the saison to be too malty almost cloying, and the IPA too high in IBU, not enough on hop aroma. 

The blonde was a well balanced beer that I enjoyed very much. My impression is that their beers have a similar yeast profile as Uninbroue's. 

They have invested a lot in this place.  It would be great to see more variety in their selection."}
{"text":"Steam trays usually keep prepared food warm without soaking the primary ingredients in moisture.  This is the secret to most secondary and hospital food preparation. Shared, no doubt, by the good people at Golden Corral. How Les 3 Brasseurs manages to put out dish after dish of room temperature, slightly wet sandwiches and burgers, is a miracle of ineptitude. It staggers the imagination that this location is almost constantly full during lunch and holiday months, and it fails to attempt to produce any memory other than that of being ripped off in a noisy, child-filled environment that plays offensively bad music and mind-numbingly stupid videos (are these house made, as well?). 

Stay far away from the rock hard soft pretzels and the rueban sandwich and the mystery meat burgers. The beer is often decent. The shrimp, when warm, can reach the rarified heights of a Northern Ohio Abblebys mid-management change. Ask for anything fresh and warm before placing an order, if you must go here. That way you have an out if you need to, and you will need to, send something, or everything back.  Verdict: the back of house is a shambles.

All that being said, I found that the servers are always very nice, hardworking and professional and, again, if you need a fresh beer, and are not picky about your food in the least, you could do worse."}
{"text":"Nite 1 in Montreal, we actually had a nice little time here...

Beer was very good.  Make it on site?  not sure, but the quality was pretty high.

I had the cheeburger-cheeburger and fries, and was definitely pretty okay.

I saw the pizza, and that looked good too.

We had good service.  All good, everything good.

This is a good place to come if you are an American Bloke.  They have TV (sports).  Burgers.  And good beer.

What else do you need."}
{"text":"Great place for a burger and beer.

The burger was big and beefy, definitely competes with some of the best burgers around.

The beer is what sets this place apart their white is one of the best I've ever had. The ipa is also very good with nice hints of citrus. The rest of their beer is very good bit not as exciting."}
{"text":"So great that we wen back again! Great poutine, unique drink menu, and good atmosphere. My only complaint is that my side of sweet potato fries was $7 and my drink was $4, so it's a bit pricey."}
{"text":"Went to 3 Brasseurs on a recommendation while in town for work. Happened to be during game 1 of Stanley Cup Finals with Montreal playing Ottawa. Great atmosphere for a game. Staff was friendly and the food & drink was good!"}
{"text":"Bien que « les 3 brasseurs » soit à la base fameux pour ses bières qui sont brassées directement sur place, je parlerai plutôt de la nourriture qui y est proposée. D'une parce que je ne bois pas de bière (oui, je sais, c'est mal...) et de deux parce qu'ayant des origines alsaciennes, autant vous dire que je m'y connais en choucroutes et en Flammenküches! 
Alors bien sûr, ils sont loin d'être au niveau des petits plats de ma grand-mère mais sur une échelle de 1 à 10, cela mériterait tout de même un 7. Mon seul regret en matière de Flammenküches est qu'il ne serve pas l'originale, celle avec seulement la crème, les lardons et l'oignon... Et SANS fromage gratiné. Mais bon, le reste des déclinaison étant très acceptable, on passera. Et puis leur paysanne est pas mal du tout d'ailleurs...
Côté ambiance et service, rien à redire, si ce n'est qu'ils sont souvent victimes de leur succès et que l'endroit est généralement bondé de monde..."}
{"text":"Went looking for a casual place to have dinner and a beer and found Les 3 Brasseurs. It was one of the more inviting places on Rue St-Paul on a chilly rainy night. It wasn't crowded but did seem to be an after work hang out for some locals. 

The service was good. I enjoyed the beer of the week. It was something between the regular blonde and amber. Love that it came in 1 liter mugs. Food was pretty good too. Had the poutine with pulled pork on top to start. Then a burger that was fresh and pretty tasty. Next time I would get the poutine without the pork. 

All in all it was good and I would certainly go again."}
{"text":"It was OK beer and  so so pizza.  Chain restaurant in Old town Montreal, looks unique from the street, but ends there.  Seems to be the Canadian equivalent of TGI Fridays."}
{"text":"We were two hot and tired tourists who needed to eat RIGHT NOW. We were on St. Catherine's.  The place we'd planned to dine at was closed.  We were seated, and I almost thought it was a mistake to come here. It looks like an aging Bennigans.  I was ready to bolt when our waiter came to take care of us.  I am glad we stayed.  Our flatbread style pizza was delicous!! The crust was thin, and the cheese had a delicous flavor that mixed nicely  with the vegetables on the dish.  We also had salad (ok for 3.49) and onion rings.  My dining partner ordered the onion rings, and it wasn't until the bill came that I saw the price:  8.99!!!! Our server stated that it was because it was real beer batter.  Well, I still don't think that justifies 8.99 for onion rings!! At any rate, it was a solid choice that afternoon."}
{"text":"Ridiculously slow service.  It took 45 minutes to get a beer at the bar.  And that was after a regular flagged down the server and said we needed service.  (After being flagged down it was still another 15 minutes before we were helped)

We also ordered the Flamm chips as a snack.  We were advised by other diners to not order anything else, as there food was not very good. The chips confirmed that.  

On a plus, the beer was good.  Or, maybe it just seemed good after such a long wait."}
{"text":"Reliable bar / restaurant that has good beer.  Always a good place to wind up at in Montreal.  Comparable to the Gordon Biersch chain in the states, Les 3 Brasseurs brews their own beer on site (supposedly) and they are all pretty damn good.  The waitstaff is very attentive and are all thankfully fluent in English as well.

The Burgers are good, the Flamms are alright, but they had this baked brie thing that was pretty damn good.  Prices for food and beer are about a dollar more than what you would expect in the States, but that's to be expected in Montreal.

Every time we go here, it's always busy but they are able to take care of anyone who comes in.  Tried to get a table at Le St. Bock down the street but it was jam packed and not a single person working there tried to accommodate us.  Like I said, this place is reliable.  There are plenty of other places to get better drinks, but it's nice to know that Les 3 Brasseurs is always there."}
{"text":"Overall :
We saw this place, not realizing it was a chain, and were curious enough to go inside.  We realized within 10 minutes that we had basically stumbled in to the Applebees of Montreal, with the slight difference that they had their own line of beers.  Don't waste your time.

Drinks :
These were the most bland, flavorless beers I've ever had.  There was a difference between the styles, but not much.  Not worth the water that went into making them.

Decor / Ambiance / Service :
Nowhere else in Quebec City or Montreal did a waiter or bartender try to shame me because I do not speak French.  My partner is fluent and so often I would wait for her to answer rather than ask for the person to speak English, but the guy behind the counter here was so impatient that wasn't possible.  It wasn't busy, it's inexplicable.  Decor was Applebees/Fridays/Chilis chic, and the terrible music videos above the bar rounded the experience out."}
{"text":"Food here was really good, had the beef dip, bruschetta w/ mozzarella sticks  and a couple of their blond beers. I think speaking French helps quite a bit in this place! I'd be back next time I'm in Monrrrreal."}
{"text":"Great place.  Poutines are awesome!  I am a beer snob and I usually lean towards IPA's, but decided to try the Amber.  It was clean, fresh and one of the best tasting draughts I have had in a long time!  Service was top notch"}
{"text":"We came here the first time we were in Montreal a couple years ago and really liked it but we didn't really order food then...just beer and shared a basic flatbread.
So we came back and the beer was still great but the food was not. Server was nice enough but we got sat right in front of the door with cold air blasting us every minute or so. It had seemed like the restaurant was really crowded when they sat us there but it turns out it wasn't and they just sat us there to torture us maybe?
If the beer wasn't so great, it would definitely have been a one star."}
{"text":"A pleasant surprise. Reviews online seemed mixed. The Sainte-Catherine location was only a few blocks from my hotel. As I'm always searching out the local beer, this was the plan for lunch.

Bartender was very friendly and helpful, guiding me through the beers. The brown I had was tasty and flavorful -- unlike the beers I had at two other brewpubs.

Food was also tasty. I had the smoked meat fllammekeuche (with pickles -- sounds odd, but it works). Sort of a super thin crust pizza. Very tasty and just right for a light lunch. 

Tried to return late in the afternoon the next day, but crowds were out the door. Evidently a local hotspot at prime times."}
{"text":"Had a late lunch with the wife and decided to try Les 3 Brasseurs on St-Denis. Place was nice and clean warm even on a gloomy day. Beer was good. Service as well. But a 15$ nothing special burger served with frozen fries. Big disappointment."}
{"text":"Brasseries ou les bières, plats ou autres sont très bons il faut le reconnaitre....
Si je met cette note c'est vraiment à cause du service, du temps d'attentes et comme je n'étais pas servis avant certains clients arrivés après moi j'ai décidé de partir tout en payant mes consommations (Bières), le manager est venu faire un scandale, il s'est carrément énervé, il ne s'est pas excusé ou autre... aucun respect du client et du service... 

Je suis très déçu par l'attitude de ce manager ce pourquoi je ne retournerai plus à ce 3 brasseurs Rue St Denis ."}
{"text":"I was at 3 Brasseurs and I had one of their veggie pizza! The wait to get a table was around 30 minutes but once seated, the service was great and the portion is huge. I finished it all and loved it! It was my first time and it didn't disappoint."}
{"text":"Les trois brasseurs c'est de la bonne bouffe pour un prix correct, (un poil trop cher pour certain) de la bonne bière et...leur cocktail limonade framboisière qui est juste dément.
Je suis fan de la salade césar avec poulet, à date ma préférée en ville! 
Bon courage pour trouver une place en terrasse en été...Mais on y arrive avec de la détermination!"}
{"text":"Location: On the trendiest street of Montreal, St. Catherine Street. Very easy to spot and great menu selection right outside the door.

Service: Our waitress was amazing and quick, very friendly and helped us pick which beers to sample with the traditional sampler (very cool!).

Drinks: After going through the five samples of home-brewed beer (white, light, amber, IPA, brown), we ordered a pint of white, which went perfectly with our meal. We also ordered a traditional sangria, which while delicious, was quite strong. You gotta love wine to have it! Fresh fruit was in the drink.

Food: As an appetizer, we ordered traditional BEER-BATTERED poutine. I cannot emphasize enough how delicious the batter on the fries were. The poutine was absolutely fantastic and the best poutine we had throughout our trip to Montreal. For our entree, we ordered burgers which were very thick and overcooked. Would much prefer a thick burger to be medium-rare rather than well done. The side caesar salad that we ordered with it, however, was amazing and was perfectly dressed. For those who are not accustomed to bacon in their caesar salads, be ready for it because Montreal is where you'll get it! (Even at McDonalds) 

Dessert: Our waitress brought us home-baked cookies to end the meal which she made for the customers. She was very nice and realized we were too full to order a full dessert so she gave them to us for free.

To summarize: Great beer, great ambiance, overcooked burgers and amazing staff. Recommend!"}
{"text":"Bon rapport qualité / prix. Digne d'une brasserie de centre ville. Toutefois si vous aimez vraiment les quesadillas si le gout est ok cela est loin du compte pour les amateurs de cuisine espagnole. Ma bavette était très bonne, dommage qu'il ait fallu renvoyer la première servie avant d'avoir la cuisson demandée (bleue). Accueil ok mais serveurs débordés pour être réellement à l'écoute."}
{"text":"Very good tasting beers. The blonde and amber were very good. The IPA was not as hoppy as us west coasters are use to but still very approachable. Don't leave here without trying the Poutine! Fantastique. Staff is very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"This Brasseurs is just as crowded as their other locations. Service was fine.

Ordered their blonde (L3B) artisan beer. A half pint was only C$3.75. Not bad, and quite swiggable. Of course, I got myself vodka and Red Bull - Canadian Red Bull (called \"Base\"), that is.

If you want a drink, and want it dependable, stop in. Still, there are better places in Montreal."}
{"text":"Les 3 Brasseurs is part of an international restaurant chain. Friends and I were thirsty, so we stopped at this particular location (on St. Denis) randomly. The venue was fairly large, fairly random, and fairly crowded. Considering the crowd, our party managed to score seats street-side, where others were already relaxing and people-watching.

Their menu was amusing, basically a faux newspaper; prices weren't bad. Our server was awesome, and even did a shot with us - there were quite a few shooters on their menu. A few of us had beers.

If I lived in the area, I'd stop back in for drinks."}
{"text":"À y aller pour une bonne bière et de la bonne bouffe. Prendre leurs \"pizzas\", les flaquelque chose, c'est pas pire pentoute. On a pris la salade et disons que je ne dirais pas que c'est leur spécialité.

Il y avait du wi-fi, gros plus!"}
{"text":"The service was alright but got the flammekueches and it was very delicious. The ambience and overall atmosphere is fun and a lot of menu options to choose from. I would return to perhaps try one of their burgers."}
{"text":"Decent pub grub for all. 

Service is a bit slow but the food is ok. 

We tried the french onion soup, Poutine and salads along w cassoulet. Everyone enjoyed their food. 

They have many beers to choose from. Good place if u appreciate that."}
{"text":"My friends and I always hit Les 3 Brasseurs in Montreal.  The beer here is tasty and you can get a liter!  The bar/restaurant reminds me of Germany.  They service great sausages and the Pork Shank is delish!"}
{"text":"It looks nice, it's full of people, they make their own beer (pretty cool to watch the process), however the food is just okay and therefore I don't really get what the hype is all about."}
{"text":"I very rarely write a one star review. This place is horrid. I mean it. I really really do. We sat outside on the terrace and it took a really long time for the waitress to come over. The Diet Cola was flat which was unfortunate. We waited over 45 minutes for the food to come and when it did, it was very disappointing. My fish and chips was ice cold, the fries under done, the fish greasy, soggy, and not crispy. The salad that my boyfriend ordered was good he said (along with his beer), and was quite pleased with his meal which made me happy at least. I told the waitress and she took the beer off the bill. Why not the offending fish!!?? Very confused. Anyway, it still cost us $40. Everyone around us waited equally as long for their food and none of it looked fresh or edible from what I could see. At least the seared tuna salad which was ordered by us was passable, if not pretty good. I have no idea because I didn't taste it - but my Honey said it had good flavor. This place is very poor. Please do yourself a favor and run very far away from this establishment."}
{"text":"This is my first trip to Montreal, as walking on the street and looking for a restaurant for a brunch, their beer menu catch my eyes. 

Food: I ordered their special brasseurs flames (sausage, red onion, mushroom) with the desert flames (I chose the banana flamms) for $14.50, which is pretty good deal. However I wish they put more onion n mushroom, it taste pretty good especially the flatbread is very crispy. It taste great with the Tabasco sauce. I had the white beer which is less alcohol, a pint for $5.95 is pretty good. 

Service: it was okay, the waiter was nice just that it hard to find him when we need something and ask for a check. Waiter too busy serving other tables."}
{"text":"Beer flight was on point with 6 nice beers. Service was lovely. Flatbread was totally ok. But it's the Roulette Russe that was unforgettable!"}
{"text":"J'aime bien mais ce n'ai pas une vrai micro-brasserie."}
{"text":"Was really excited about this place However, it took my wife and I 2 hours to have our 2 salads and order of poutine. I think it's an understaffing issues which reflects on the poor management. There are many choices on that street and I will certainly be moving on to try others. One and done for us."}
{"text":"I went to Montreal for the first time - and not the last - from December 30 2017 - January 1, 2018, on a whim, with a boy I just started dating.  Having had poutine only once before - sac le blur! how is that? - and being of the mindset that my happy calories should be saved for french fries and cheese and not cookies and cupcakes, it became our intention to eat some Motha Effin' poutine before we left.  Besides, it's important to have goals, especially whilst traveling.  Poutine seemed to me to be a perfect guilty pleasure to end out the year, before diets and resolutions (bleh!) were to begin.  In my defense, I'll say the cold sort of forced us off of the street and into Les 3 Brasseurs on New Year's Eve for a late lunch. In general, I prefer to support a Mom and Pop establishment before some big corporate empire but I did not realize this was a chain and all over the city, until we drove around on New Years Day and passed half a dozen.  In hindsight, I feel like I was the unknowing tourist in Manhattan, eating at the Red Lobster.  

The friendly hostess greeted us within seconds and seated us in under a minute.  Our waitress came over pretty quickly.  We each got a beer, and I was excited to try something new because they brew their own. My new friend got either an ale or a lager, I can't remember, but it looked and tasted like a Winter Warmer to me, which is neither ale nor lager.  I got their IPA, which did not taste like an IPA at all.  What was it missing? Oh, that's right.  Flavor!  In fact, I'd rather have had a Budweiser, and for you Budweiser drinkers, let me be clear, that's not a compliment. I had the thought to ask her if we got the wrong beers and then wussed out.

The poutine we ordered was good, not great.  My expectations were too high.  Maybe they always are... They say the best things come to those who wait, and I guess we didn't wait long enough. The couple of days fantasizing about gravy-, shredded meat-, and cheese curd-covered french fries had gotten me all worked up for something that simply did not deliver.  The meat was aight, the gravy was meh - and might have been from a Heinz jar - the cheese curds were tasteless (am I the only one who thinks cheese should taste like something?) and I wish they were a little more room temperature. The fries, the foundation of the dish, in my mind, were nothing to write home about. This dish deserves fries made to order, with the skin on, browned to perfection.  You know what kind of fries I'm talking about, fry lovers. These fries were the palest yellow, tasty (I'm a food snob, but I'd eat any ol' fry off of the floor if it fell off a plate) but not worthy of such a dish. 

Our waitress was friendly. I appreciate that she checked in with us since a Food Runner, not she, had brought our food out.  The place was packed, the spirit merry, with most of the patrons bundled up in their coats, hats and scarves at the bar or at tables.  I'm glad we didn't get anything else.  I wouldn't go into one of these places again except to get a beer, and if I got a bad beer again, I'd speak up."}
{"text":"This is my third time to a 3B and I find there quality of food, beer and service very dependable. 

This last time I had a group of 11 with me.  Checked earlier in the day if they could accommodate us later and they took our reservation--even let me pick out a spot.  

Sure enough our table was waiting and the service by Vincent and the whole staff couldn't have been more effeicient.  We had a Cirque show to catch at the Old Port, do it was a perfect location in Old Town.  Plus, when I told the staff our time limit and we were all paying seperately, there was no eye rolling or attitude.  (America really needs to adapt the portable card machines!). 

Excellent menu selection for pub food plus fare.  I enjoyed a Smoked salmon/shrimp flammenkuken.  Delicious.

I really recommend this place for some pub flare with style."}
{"text":"I'm a huge craft beer fan so having a chain restaurant brew their own beer is definitely a great place to be! Great food for all to enjoy and vegetarian options. I had the sausage plate, which was awesome but too many sausages to handle lol it's perfect for a night out with the guys or a casual date experience."}
{"text":"The food item that most people come here for is the flamm which according to their menu is \"not a pizza\", however that's simply the easiest way to describe it to someone.

Sure it isn't a pizza, but it's pizza like. Flattened dough with ingredients on top. Because of how thin it is, it ends up being extremely crispy which is delicious.

This little chain is typical of most micro-brew bar / restaurants. You know, exposed vats, beer steins, barrels, wood and iron. The typical things that would make you think...brewery.

It does get pretty packed in here but it is one of the places that the kitchen stays open reasonably late with decent bar food.

The Quebecoise flamm is by far one of the most popular from the reaction I got from the server when I ordered it. I can certainly see why, it is a simple combination of some of the tastiest ingredients.  Onions. Bacon and cheese.  All three of which are heavily enjoyed on their own.

This is certainly not a destination eatery by any means, but it is a place you can easily kick back at for some beer  and food.

Check out the meter stick, which is a meter of beer."}
{"text":"Terrible management. Worst 3 brasseur in the Montreal area. Received aweful service multiple times. Manager was screaming at his employees during one visit. Service understaffed and long waits."}
{"text":"This place is great for the atmosphere and location but their food shouldn't be what you come for, nor their beer selection. My husband and I had the wraps and there was much too much sauce to even taste the chicken and veggies in there...maybe that was a good thing? The other couple we were with had the flatbread pizzas which we tried and those too were meh.

Service was great, location was prime but other than that not a place I'd ever crave to go to."}
{"text":"4-star rating is more for the experience than the food. Our server was very friendly and welcoming. The whole family ordered the house beers. The special was a raspberry ale, which was great, not sweet just a hint of raspberry. We ordered the Duck Confit Poutine and were waiting a while for it. We received our entrees first and the poutine came after. We were in no rush so it was fine and the poutine was quite good. For my entree, I had the Maxi Chicken Brochette. The tomato sauce and vegetables were good, but the chicken was dry. My family ordered a Flamm, sriracha burger, and traditional burger. The Flamm was great, nice and crispy, while the burgers were okay. Visiting from the US so not sure if this is normal in Canada, but I thought it was odd the server didn't ask how the burger should be cooked and they ended up well done. Ended the meal with a delicious liege waffle and watching Michael Phelps win another gold medal. 

Overall, the family and I enjoyed our time. Our server was gracious and apologetic about the late poutine so we left happy and full."}
{"text":"This is my very first 1 star review, but this place deserves it. Service was slow, we couldn't order appetizers because we were told they would take as long to cook as the main course (??), and they took almost 20 minutes to get a waiter to take our order. Other issues were flat soda, no ice, and a lack of butter for bread. 

For making beer on the premises, the amber beer I ordered was, to be frank, not good. For the main course I ordered pork shank, which might as well been called pork fat shank, as there was more of it than the actual meat. Everyone's else's meals were lackluster as well. 

To put it simply, we spoke to a local the next day who said we would have been better off eating at McDonald's. Enough said."}
{"text":"This has got to be the weirdest waitressing experience I have ever had. 

This was the Friday lunch with the colleagues. We get to the main entrance and ask if there is room on the terrace. Response: No. You have to go all around to McGill College and ask yourself. 

We get to terrace and ask the waitress if there is room on the terrace. Response: No. 

We then ask her if there is room in the main restaurant. Response: No. You have to ask yourself. 

What kind of restaurant does not have a communication system of some sort where waiters can ask each other whether they have tables left?! 

Moving on. We get a table inside. We managed to order our food very quickly. I asked for no tomatoes on my burger and yet I got them. My colleague asked for no onions on her sandwich and yet she got them. We asked a busboy to give us some forks and knives. He said: Ask your waiter. In the end, we got them OURSELVES and I noticed how it made our waiter a little nervous.  

The food: My burger was a little dry. I make better burgers than this one and yet I am not a fantastic cook. I think my colleagues liked their pizzas. It was definitely overpriced. I'm not a beer person but the people who had a beer said they were average. 

Conclusion: Will not go back unless someone asks me too, because there is a hockey game on or something. Actually, I would probably try to convince them to go elsewhere. 

P.-S. When you leave the restaurant there is a little station where you can press a button to show your (dis)satisfaction. Needless to say we all pressed the red :( button very enthusiastically."}
{"text":"Chicken and waffles sandwich was very good.  There was a wait but it moved as expected, and the food was served in a reasonable amount of time after ordering."}
{"text":"my love for now. every time pass by, want to have a drink here. good place for afternoon relax."}
{"text":"Unless you're just grabbing a beer, you can do better than this in Montreal.  Saying that, their own beer is very good so if that's what you are after this is a good choice.  Good spot to watch a hockey game as well."}
{"text":"Very kewl, laid back place.  Brew their own beer!  Very nice atmosphere, quick service and super yummy flat bread pizza.  On an off note, the sink in the restroom was really unique!  Went here for lunch, no wait, got right in.  Great place to hang with friends and watch a game.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Try as we might, humankind cannot live on beer alone. So, order the maxi fries. I drankkk my firssst liter size IPA beeeeerrrrr and cu, cu, could not beee more haapppy.  Seriously, the smoked Rueben sandwich although not as smoky as I had hoped for, tasted great. The service was spot on, the staff; friendly and attractive even before the drinking began. 
My birthday and the excuse to watch the world cup had me coming back, 3 times over the weekend."}
{"text":"A solid choice for the weary traveler and or sight seer. Just as heartland brewery won't win any awards for its food neither will this place but it is essentially the same spot. Poutine was solid, beer was pretty good(in house brew only) and the pizza flat bread wasn't bad but what's really that good outside of the ny metro area? Prices were easy to deal with and place was nice enough. Think sports bar(wings, sampler platter, tvs and beer) meets brewery. It was definitely good enough."}
{"text":"Great beer, good food. As a pub, all you can ask for.
Except....service was slow and when active, brought the entre after the main meal. When I tipped only 10%, which was generous, the waitress showed displeasure and tossed the receipt back crumpled onto the table. Won't go back!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience and the vibe of this place.
Didn't care for the blonde beer, but the lighter beer was good and the sangria was GREAT.

Enjoyed the poutine and another house speciality. The waitress was really nice and ordered us a taxi because our phones didn't work.

I would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"I had a refreshing raspberry ale at the recommendation of my server for happy hour- it was delicious, I could drink this all night. I accompanied my drinking with some dinner... The French Dip, a beef sandwich with jus to dip, and salad dressed in their house beer dressing. Perfection! Staff are very friendly and happy to speak English, which is a real treat here in Montreal! :)"}
{"text":"Good beers and decent
food.  Gets loud sometimes, but it's
just fine overall."}
{"text":"Definitely nothing special about this place. It's a chain restaurant, and you can definitely tell by the lack of quality and good management. 

I've actually been to Les Trois Brasseurs more times than I can count, but that says nothing about my lack of affection for the establishment. I've gone so many times because I live only a few blocks from their locations on St. Catherine and it's one of the closest places to go watch a hockey game and grab a drink. 

The food is lackluster pub food. I usually get a chicken and pesto flamm since it's one of the healthiest items on the menu. Portion sizes are huge for Quebec standards, but not anything special. They do brew their own beer, which I can appreciate, but Quebec has far better beers to offer at other local brewpubs. 

My main issue with Les Trois Brasseurs is that they have consistently terrible service. On several visits we have waited over an hour for our food. More than once we have ordered a beer and had it not come until well after our food was served. Forgetting our order, not bringing something we asked for, or bringing us the wrong order is a usual occurrence.

My advice, go to Les Trois Brasseurs if you're out of other options. Otherwise, there are far better places to go to in the city."}
{"text":"Don't come for the service, come for the food and beer! 

We waited about 5 min after coming in the door before we saw anyone that worked here. Granted it was about 9pm on a week night. After that the service was sufficient.

Our group of 6 was seated shortly after. We ordered drinks which were brought out in a timely manner and we ordered some appetizers, the Toulouse sausage and the traditional nachos. At this point we had still only seen one employee. There were several other tables seated and several more at the bar. This place has much more seating available than was occupied. The appetizers were delivered, looked amazing and tasted delicious.

At this point, we ordered entrees. Entrees ordered included the spicy beer muscles, BBQ cajun chicken, BBQ pulled pork sandwich, and the cassoulet. The entrees were delivered in a timely fashion and again everything looked amazing and tasted delicious.

By the end of the night we have counted at least five different employees we saw during our visit.

Overall this was a good experience. What made it good was the beer the food and the great people we were with."}
{"text":"It's pub fare.  They make aok beers.  Screens are small.  Food is below average.  It's a Plan C when Plan A and B don't work out."}
{"text":"Stopped here for some beer to catch a little bit of football
Yup, lots of screens w games
It.s in the middle of a touristy area
The staff is on and off
Some are courteous and some are just ignorant rude
Beer is made there 
It was okay
I didn't love this place"}
{"text":"Great casual place that serves some classic european meals not easy to find in Montreal."}
{"text":"We stopped in to catch the euro cup and had a great time (even though Italy lost). We sat at the bar and drank their well crafted brews while sharing the sausage and olive pizza (called Fran...something) and the sausage and sauerkraut dinner. Everything was excellent including the service even though they were insanely busy. To add to the culinary experience the decor was awesome; along with 5 viewable vats at the side there were 2 vats hanging directly over the centre of the bar. I recommend this microbrewery and restaurant."}

{"text":"1st of all ...We end up there yesterday cause la belle et la boeuf was packed... although service was  nice;I have to say dont get the chicken wings! it was soooo salty my blood  pression was probably out of control after eating those wings. 2 of my friends took a burger and it didnt taste much she had to kill it with tabasco sauce and pepper, the pizz was decent and my chicken sandwich was ok.I asked for a cesar salad with the dressing on side....I had my dressing on side but my salad was mixed with some dressing .....so welll ya didnt eat that. The highlight of the meal was the desserttttt those  brownies bits were  the bomb.com  crispy outside, gooey delicious inside and the  caramel sauce So dessert  overal meal meh...."}
{"text":"Ehh. Beers were okay. Tourist trap for sure... they have a lot of tv's, well that's what they say. Not sure about the food tho... I do not think I would come back to this place. I would definitely stay away and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I liked it.  I got the gigantic vat sized jug of microbrewed beer so I was very happy.  The food was good too.  My kid ordered the Vladimir Putin platter of crap (french fries with gravy, cheese balls and grease) and we made love to it.  Took 5 years off my circulatory system but it was delicious.

This place is right on tourist trap road so if you're lazy like us you need to eeny meeny Minee mo a place..  this one is pretty good.   

Order the humongous jug of beer with the highest alcohol content and you'll like this place..."}
{"text":"I know this is a chain, and I normally abhor and avoid chains, but I really liked this place.  The beer was excellent, the servers were very polite and attentive (Everybody speaks English) and the food was way above average.  First time we went I had a flammekuchen with Gruyere and smoked meat with a slice of dill pickle on every quarter.  Excellent!  My wife had the vegetable version which was great as well.  Second visit I had a meat dish with ham, pork knuckle, sausage and an excellent sauerkraut.  Very, very good.  We had a great time watching the Canadiens at the bar after the meal.  Overall I would highly recommend this place, at least one visit to sample their beers which are a cut above your average brew pub."}
{"text":"We came here after eating dinner nearby to grab a beer.  We tried a couple of different beers and enjoyed both.  At first we sat outside, which was perfect as we wanted to do some people watching in the Old Town on our first night in town.  We were told we had to order food to sit out there, so we ordered a pizza even though were weren't hungry and then ended up eating half of it anyway.  It was better than expected.  We moved inside at around midnight and continued drinking at the bar.  This place was pretty rowdy and seemed to attract a lot of younger, heavy drinkers.  Exactly the place I would have loved when I was a student!  Not exactly the place a couple of 30-something married ladies want to go to catch up after not seeing each other in months.  

This place is great for large groups, younger more boisterous people or anyone looking for a nice beer selection in a busy bar."}
{"text":"Las pizzas y los nachos son muy ricos. Sin duda es un buen lugar para echarte unas chelas y cenar antes de empezar la fiesta"}
{"text":"Liked it enough. Not really a bar I would hang out at, but they have lots of screens so it's good for watching games. I did really like their Flamm (sp?) though - it's like a really thin-crust pizza but not quite; the one I ordered had bacon and raclette cheese on it and was delicious. Beer is pretty good and average price. Would come back again."}
{"text":"Came here again...improved quite a bit. Maybe it was just the server we had the last time I was here, but this time they were quick an attentive. Food was spot on, and also the drinks came out quickly. It still isn't an \"amazing\" place, but it is good pub food with a German twist to it."}
{"text":"Parfait pour finir la soirée, tout ce qu'il faut pour boire et manger. Le service est bien dans l'ensemble. Les télés diffusent les chaînes sportives. Ce n'est ni ma première, ni ma dernière visite."}
{"text":"It's pub food ... which I love. Nothing stood out as remarkable. The salmon was a large portion but dry and cooked too long (not overcooked necessarily). Probably a ploy for you to drink more. Blondes and Ambers were tasty beers. A decent mix of tourists and locals. Menu is completely in French but most staff are bilingual."}
{"text":"I had amber and blonde. Awesome beer, awesome pub food. They have menu in English and all of the staff speaks English and are very helpful."}
{"text":"I visited this spot last night and left feeling rather unenthusiastic. Our waitress was not super polite and only came to our table after we flagged her down. For a brewery, the beer was subpar. We ordered the nachos and a pizza; the pizza was tiny and had no crust, could barely serve two people. It also came out cold. The nachos tasted and looked like they were not fresh out of the oven, but were pretty good nonetheless. The interior of the restaurant was very nice, and the prices were quite cheap. I would recommend this place if you're looking for a simple night out with laid-back pub food- not if you want real, authentic, brewery-style beer and food."}
{"text":"I love their amber beer it is the best beer ever. Their food is ok but mainly you go there mainly for the beer. 

Ambiance is like a sports bar ambiance, not special. But again their beer is the best. 

They have a terrasse upstairs but I do not take a chance to go there and it rains so I will be wet. Better safe than sorry hehe. Cheers!!"}
{"text":"I came with my friend on a Friday night. The waiting time is extremely long, we waited 25minutes for the food. I understand that the restaurants was busy but the waiters were just walking around and not paying attention to their customers when they were ready to order! We were totally being ignored and really felt pissed."}
{"text":"Les 3 Brasseurs was ok. It wasn't anything special. It was your typical brewery/pub and has your typical bar food. The waiter and staff were very nice. We went on St. Patrick's Day, so it became packed around lunch time.

Considering they are a brewery, I noticed they had quite a few foods infused with the house made beer (I.e dips, chicken, etc.). Because I am pregnant and didn't know, I was playing it safe and didn't want to ordered anything that had alcohol in it. So I played it safe with a pizza and salad. Later I found out that when alcohol is cooked in foods it burns off and is used for flavor. I ordered a pizza with cheese and tomatoes on it and a side Caesar salad. My meal was ok, it filled me up but like I said previously there was nothing special about it. My husband ordered the Pulled Pork BBQ sandwich with a side Caesar salad. He enjoyed his food and said it was pretty good. 

Overall, Les 3 Brasseurs was ok if you like bar/pub food. If you aren't a big fan of this type of food I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"If this place were just based on location, it would be a 5. They are a local micro brew chain with a nice selections of different beers. This particular one is located in the Latin Quarter. I found this odd, because I think there were more sushi places on this road that Latin. 

Anyway, we hit the roof top deck. It was packed. The tables were right on top of each other. The weather was very cloudy and it looked like rain. The hostess was sure to let us know that if it started raining, we would have to leave b.c there was no more room in the restaurant. Odd, but fine. 

We ordered a baked brie app that was quite good. One order is fine for 2 peeps and it came with a small salad as well. Service was a bit slow and since it was outside, people were all allowed to smoke. For cold beers and a quick snack, it is a cool place to hang outside."}
{"text":"Food was decent, beer was cold, but service ... ended up with a bad server that is in to arguing with his customers. 

Came for happy hour - $5 beers between 3-6pm. 

We ordered our first beer at 3:10pm. Got the final check to leave at 4:35 and the beers were charged starting at $6.50 each. When we contested, he said we ordered before happy hour stared. Even when we ordered our second beers around 3:40 he said they didn't count because he said we placed our first order before 3pm. Never heard anything like this before. 

We knew the time when we sat and ordered because we came specifically for happy hour. But the waiter argued with us threateningly and we were pressured to pay the bill as is.  

Won't be going back. 
Too many other nice places nearby with better service where they don't threaten the customer and where we don't get ripped off."}
{"text":"Woah!
Je suis allée souvent aux 3B et ce n'était pas ma première visite à cette succursale, mais j'ai essayé pour la première fois la poutine au canard confit et ouf lala, un vrai délice! J'en aurais pris un tiers de plus pour combler complètement mon appétit, ne serait-ce qu'en ajoutant une petit portion de frites. Nous étions quatre, deux d'entre nous ont pris un burger des 3B, qui est un burger assez traditionnel. Un p'tit punch de plus pour qu'il se distingue serait intéressant! Très bon, toutefois. 

La Stanley Stout (bière de quartier) est à essayer pour les amateurs de bière plus foncée. Je n'étais pas une grande fan des bières des 3B jusqu'à ce que je goûte cette dernière. C'est avec une stout qu'ils m'ont eue, qui l'eût cru! Vraiment, je l'ai trouvée excellente.

Service correct, la serveuse s'assure qu'on a tout ce qu'il faut lorsqu'on reçoit nos assiettes et repasse une fois pendant le repas. Les desserts me semblaient peu attrayants, peut-être qu'un visuel m'aurait mis l'eau à la bouche."}
{"text":"We had hungry teens but wanted to walk down the quaint street that the restaurant was on. 
The hostess had a menu in English and that was a big plus for us! 
We were a bit chilled and decided to pass up their large outdoor dining area. We opted to sit inside where there was loud, live music playing. 
Our server was quite jovial and had a twinkle in his eye. 
We ordered some beer that they had brewed in the restaurant, it was good.
We started with the pretzel and sampler appetizers. It was a good thing we got appetizers because it took awhile to get our food.
My son got the French dip and was pleased.
I got the poutine which was fair.
My husband and daughter split the ploughmans platter which they enjoyed. 
We left feeling very full and ready to explore!"}
{"text":"This place transformed into a touristic destination. They have their own microbrewery that's not my favorite. I would suggest the flammkuchen, an alsacien dish; pizza like very thin dough. I used to like going there few years ago, not anymore as service and quality aren't as it used to be."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of a Canadian version of a Gordon Biersch, but with worse food (if such a thing can be envisioned). The building and interior are great: Victorian industrial with massive riveted steel beans, dark wood, and superb design. You'd think it one of the finest brewpubs in Montreal until the corporate graphics and other chain-like signs begin to sink in. 

The beer is brewed on premises in this local chain (supposedly there are some in Paris, too). It is good, but predictable: better than commercial beers but not the equal of the better independents. The food is de-tuned pub food done badly. There are many superior choices for food and for beer in the area."}
{"text":"We were walking through Old Montreal, decided for the first time on our trip to pick a restaurant by our own choice and not by recommendations of the locals.  Big mistake.  The restaurant had a lot of people, and the menu seemed to have good options, so we figured it couldn't be bad.  It was.  The only thing worse than a bad meal is an expensive bad meal.  My \"Euro\" sandwich was honestly worse than what I would get at Subway - dry and bland.  My husband's expensive steak was \"forgettable.\"  I was tempted to tell people passing by not to eat here, it was that disappointing.  Save your money."}
{"text":"Walking around Old Montreal and stumbled upon this place. Seemed inviting. Food was your average bar food. Beer was exceptional. As a microbrewery they had a wide variety of different beers. Had to try them all. The double IPA was a limited run, but was amazing."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place as I was looking for some grub while staying by the Montreal airport on business.  Place is huge, clean with an enormous TV wall that broadcasts several different things. 

Sat at the bar (as usual) and the staff was very attentive and knowledgeable about the beer and menu.  The gentleman behind the bar gave me several tastings to make sure I was set in the right beer for my burger. 

Oh, now for the burger...  I have the Brie Blue Burger which was cooked perfectly and the the fries were fantastic!

I'll be back for sure..."}
{"text":"Good food & decent service,
Only bad thing is that the table next to us had 4 drunk guys & one throwing up in a bucket.
Pretty gross & loss my appetite....
Hopefully next time the staff can escort him to a different area so he doesn't gross out other guests"}
{"text":"Food was amazing! My friend came here for her birthday and it was a good atmosphere. I split a duck confiti poutine and French dip sandwich. Both excellent. The group also shared white wine and beer sangria. Mixed reviews from the group, but as I personally dislike the taste of beer, I much preferred the wine one. Service was mediocre; they were very understaffed. It took a long time before our orders were taken and we had to ask twice for our first glasses of water. However, we told the waitress it was our friend's birthday and we were given a small fudge/brownie? No candle because apparently it's a fire hazard. We'd probably return just for the food though!"}
{"text":"Strictly a poutine review. Grew up in Toronto and haven't had poutine in years. I loved their poutine I just wish it was bigger! The place is a bar and is a nice relaxed place to sit back and have a beer and chat with friends."}
{"text":"People give it a hard time because it's a chain, but the simple fact is, they have a DELICIOUS white beer (among others) and the vibe is always good.  Even if it's not the kind of place you'd spend a whole night at, nothing wrong with watching the game, hammering back some massive glasses of beer, and eating a flammekueche.

I'm a fan, screw the haters"}
{"text":"This is a great place to go. May not be the typical food to eat in Montreal but hey who cares. They have great food and great BEER. The staff is friendly and speak English. Bonus for a guy like me who has a hard time with the English language, don't think I can ever learn another language. 
Come check this place out. You'll like it."}
{"text":"Nice tavern with large selections for casual lunch in Old Montreal. Nice waitress and service. Burgers offered only cooked well but was still juicy and tasty. The cheddar beer soup and onion soup were also good. Little disappointed in the goat cheese tartin although still tasty a bit overpriced for sundried tomato goat cheese on open faced slice of toasted bread. Thought it would  be served on pastry tartin. Lots of beer choices, beer flights."}
{"text":"I ordered a blonde beer and a 12 oz N.Y. strip loin steak. The food was good, but what really won me over was the beer. It was crisp and light and just plain better than anything I've had from a bottle or can. A microbrewery restaurant that lives up to its name."}
{"text":"Been there a few times lovely place and great food but tonight we brought friends from out of town. The guy serving is Phillip was great and really nice. But after we paid our bill and we were finishing up, nobody had said anything about what time to leave. This little man with a \"shaved head\" was incredibly rude and told us to leave. I said that our friend was just in the bathroom he turned and shouted at Phillip and Phillip told us we had to leave. What a shame this happened after a wonderful night, won't be there again , thank you little man !!"}
{"text":"This place is aight.  It's similar to any decent chain restaurant around.  The beer got mixed reviews from my dining companions (I don't drink beer that's promoted as \"high quality\").  One really enjoyed it and another compared the blonde to \"Andrew Hume's asshole\"."}
{"text":"The duck confit poutine is out of this world! I tried to find it in other Old Town restaurants...very few have it there. I also enjoyed a chicken quinoa salad. Getting to sit on the street was very lucky, as the vibe of Old Town is terrific. The tables are a little close together.The service was reasonable given the right quarters and the constantly busy staff. If you prefer a bar atmosphere the indoor seating is plentiful as well. If found it delightful both ways, so just decide which experience you'd prefer."}
{"text":"Un brasserie au coeur du quartier latin, à deux pas de la Grande Bibliothèque, de l'UQAM et du CEGEP du Vieux-Montréal. 

À l'étage, on peut admirer les 5 cuves servant à brasser la bière maison.  Blanche, blonde, rousse, brune ou noire, vous n'aurez que l'embarras du choix."}
{"text":"One star for the amber beer. Otherwise, the single worst meal in Canadian history - with service to match. Tragic."}
{"text":"Being a regular costumer for few months now, I always feel welcome. Not every Waiter / Waitress is the same, but some are just better. Amazing service at the bar! You have to ask for Iva ! Great variety of drinks, beers are local and they taste great. The food is always served quick and the order is made right. With great ambiance, and welcoming service, a good way to relax after a work day. They made a costumer for months now. I recommend the place."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, perfect location for us as it was just next door to where we were staying.  Tried the beer sangria.  Boring and tasted just like morning OJ.  Had a traditional flight that was much better.  Happy to try some new ones.  We shared a poutine/flat bread for lack of a better description.  Better than expected.  Was able to catch a bit of the Stanly Cup so that was a big bonus.  Staff was slow but quickly apologized and made it right."}
{"text":"After walking around all day, sightseeing, shopping and museum hopping, all we wanted was to sit down and have a beer. At 5pm on a Sunday night this was proving to be harder than one would imagine. A sudden craving for buffalo wings struck and off we were to find a pub-style spot with simple pub food and a couple of beers.

Les Brasseurs could not have been a more perfect spot. It was like TGIFridays, but with a brewery. They had wings (albeit dry ones with barbecue sauce and no bleu cheese), they had beer by the pitcher and all of that cheesy flair decor you'd come to expect from a chain restaurant. 

The service was slow (even with hardly anyone in the restaurant) and, given all of the friendliness we were used to from our Canadian counterparts, kind of aloof and non-existent.

The beers were really tasty...crisp and fresh. Because we planned on having dinner later in the night, we shared only a plate of chicken wings. They were crisp but kind of small and dry...with only a side of barbecue dipping sauce that had a bit of a kick.

While it satisfied and wet the whistle, with all of the good places to eat around this part of town, it's easy to give this place the once over and walk on. But if you're looking to spend a little money and have a filling meal with a decent mug of beer, give Les 3 Brasseurs a shot."}
{"text":"Ma première visite a ce restaurant
Beau décor tout neuf.
Plafonds très hauts
Meme si des bières sont fabriquées sur place il y a quand même un bon choix de vins au verre et pas seulement du vin bas de gamme ou maison.
Nous étions un groupe de 8
Nous avons commandes des entrées
Pizza minces 4 variétés sur la plaque. Delicieuse.
Planche de charcuterie. Aussi très bien présenté sur planche et servi avec marinades et croûtons.
Les calamares et les rondelles d'oignons laissent un peu à désirer. Pas certain que c'est fait sur place. 
L'atmosphère était relax et joyeuse.
Belle terrasse
Bel endroit pour une soirée de groupe mais aussi en couple sur une banquette.
Le service etait aussi excellent par une jeune serveuse à son affaire qui passait voir si tout était bien. 
Grand stationnement en face"}
{"text":"I haven't eaten at this location, so although I'm sure it's the exact same food as the other L3B's in the area, I won't comment on the food quality here.

I don't know what it is with their beers, it's something that I can't quite verbalize.  I tried several different beers: the blanche, the blonde, the IPA (which was a new item on the menu) and a couple of others, including a seasonal.  They all had this... funk about them, except for the IPA. Like a hint of clove and foot.  My wife noticed it immediately as well.  In fact, even though she doesn't care for IPA's, the IPA was still her favorite of the group (because it was sans funk).

If you're not limited to the immediate area, I'd branch out and try a different place for a good micro brew.  Or honestly, either stick to the IPA (or maybe the stout, which I didn't try) or find another place with a decent selection that's not made in-house."}
{"text":"The food was thoroughly good for a mid-level French Canadian restaurant -- poutine, mussels, Quebec beer. But the service left a lot to be desired. When we revealed we only spoke English, they were pretty rude about getting us English menus and would leave us for long periods of time. My companion and I wanted our drinks refreshed and had to wait about 10 minutes for it.

Because of these service issues, I can't recommend it. I wouldn't return."}
{"text":"I'm sure excellent meals have been served here, however, the day that I visited was definitely NOT one of them. My husband and I ordered Poutine as a starter and found it \"okay\". You could definitely tell the fries were of the generic food service variety, and the gravy tasted as if it came straight from the jar. My husband ordered the pork shank and mash and was definitely let down. There was far more inedible fat and connective sinews than actual meat. I ordered the \"peppy\" pizza which was okay but wound up picking most of the pepperoni off because it was filled with hard gristle! I really wanted to give them a decent review, and I'm sure that other locations in MTL are decent, however, this one just didn't hit the mark- at all."}

{"text":"Loud. Mediocre and Loud.
I have been trying to like this place for a year but I give up. Each new experience is worse than the one before."}
{"text":"Good service...Not so much for the food...

Two steaks ordered Medium rare...One arrived med/med-well...The other was blue rare at best...Pretty much raw

Noisy and busy but our server was great. I'm sure of we were not pressed for time she would have done the best to mack our food right too!"}
{"text":"Came with a group of friends and the food was fine, but way too pricey for what they offer. The french dip and sausage and sauerkraut are among the better choices, but almost $20 for each dish is too much. I tried the flatbread when I came here ~a year ago and was disappointed with what was mostly plain pizza dough, with a small amount of tasteless stuff on it. Delivery pizza is gourmet in comparison. 

The atmosphere is casual and they have good beer, so I can see this being a place to watch hockey, or a place to go with a large group. But if you're looking for dinner, I recommend you look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Okay - we were hungry and we wandered into here for an 'easy' meal and that usually means going to a chain.

The vegetarian pizza was so-so but had decent char.  I ran through the selection of beers and they were pretty mediocre.  A bit better than Brutopia on the beer front, so don't expect delicious beer here.

And my French sucks -- why did they name their chain after girl-on-girl three-titty bras?"}
{"text":"Loved this place. We wandered in after a day of exploring the city and had to wait a bit for a table outside. The location was perfect and the food was excellent. The best part of the meal was the beer which was unique and flavorful. The service was quite slow so I don't know if this is a place to go if you're in a rush. Great casual restaurant in the heart of picturesque Old Montreal."}
{"text":"...ended up here after doing a hike/walk around McGill U. Wasn't my first choice, but my friends were already seated and had ordered by the time I showed up. It has a vague-Heartland Brewery-esque feel to it (NYC reference for those that know) - a little contrived, authenticity wagging it's finger, with only partial affect, in covering up it's commercialism.

But look - you're new to Montreal - you've just done some heavy duty shopping in the area - and you're looking for a spot with guaranteed seating, some brews, some food - Les 3 Brasseurs isn't your worst bet.

Charcuterie - adequate
Flammekueches - decent (flat bread pizza - very thin crust)
Pork shank, sausage, ham combo - in the words of Anthony Bourdain - definitely a dish to make you feel funky fresh (don't plan on moving much after consuming this)

Beers abound - go here for a drink.

A little bit like a much higher level TGIF - as I noted before - Heartland Brewery-esque."}
{"text":"Staff was courteous. Food was okay. Barmaids offered excellent service."}
{"text":"The bottled beer is by far the best thing on the menu. The draft beers are pretty good, but not great. Do not go here for food."}
{"text":"J'y ai été pour souper.  Nous avons été accueillis par deux gars intéressés par leur discussion et moins par l'arrivé de clients.  
Le repas qu'on nous a servis était du niveau d'une cafétéria d'école secondaire. Petite portion, présentation moyenne.  
Rien d'impressionnant pour ce resto à la bonne réputation."}
{"text":"There's something about this place I adore.

Of note is the flamm- a very flattened pizza.  Anyplace I can get a yummy pizza-like substance along with a pitcher of beer for under $20 is great in my eyes.

Also love the beer mugs- I'm not gonna deny sneaking one into my purse many years ago (before I found out I could purchase them).

Guys who work here are easy on the eyes, quick to serve, and make for a generally exciting atmosphere of eating"}
{"text":"Subpar poutine. Fries were pretty disgusting actually. Beer was nice. Service was absolutely terrible. I sat for 20 mins with nobody coming to take my order, and sat for 20 more trying to pay. Probably will never come back"}
{"text":"Food was really good. They make their own beer which was okay, there's a beer option for everyone though."}
{"text":"Service and décor are actually great, unfortunately it stops there.  Great beer paddles, but unfortunately cradling some pretty iffy beers.  

The lint in the bellybutton -  Pickles.  You read right, I said it - pickels.   Quartered dill pickle dickin up my smoked meat pizza.  If you're a hardcore pickle freak this might work for you, but good god almighty - not for me.  Pickles and their accompanying juice warming on a pizza - GROSS"}
{"text":"Look, I know Les 3 Brasseurs is basically the Chili's of Quebec... but it's new and exciting to me. \"You're an ignorant American, you don't know what good food is, you're such a typical tourist,\" yadda yadda yadda... Spare me your judgment.

Our first option was a highly reputable BBQ place in the area, but when we showed up, the windows were boarded up... So we needed a backup plan. In a pinch on a Friday night, Les 3 Brasseurs came through with an open table for five in only 15 minutes, so I'd say that alone deserves some credit.

The beer was pretty darn good, on par with other house beers you might find at a chain brewpub in the States. Having a liter of it makes it even better; go for quantity if you can't have quality, right?

Unlike nearly every American restaurant chain ever conceived, the portion sizes here are absolutely perfect. It's quintessential \"French Women Don't Get Fat\" stuff. I had the cassoulet: a mélange of various meats mixed with white beans, a side salad, and a piece of garlic bread. Very rich but modestly sized, and left me perfectly satiated.

Our waitress was very sweet, and didn't mind that we didn't speak French. Our food came out in a reasonable period of time considering just how crowded it was. Everything's better in Canada! Well, except for all the taxes."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for a couple of beers at this brew pub.  It's conveniently located where all the action is in Old Montreal.  Had an IPA and a nitro Stout ($6.50 ea. CA).  Both were very good.  The Stout was very creamy with the nitro.  Service at the bar was quick and friendly.  Tastings were available first if you needed to make up your mind.  We tasted a Rhubarb and Hibiscus beer first, but it just wasn't for us."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a late lunch and was pretty impressed.  Good beer selection and looked to be a younger crowd but still good atmosphere - beautiful day for sitting and chilling outside.  Had pint of their Blonde brew and was pretty decent and followed it up with the Quebecoise poutine and the italian sausage flammekeuche.  Both were pretty good as well.

Overall everything was pretty good but not great or fantastic.  I'd go back again but will not be making a special trip."}
{"text":"Extremely slow service. Food came out 30min later, but looked like it had been sitting in the kitchen for most of that time. Nachos we're cold, the cheese on top was crusty, not the cheese you want on nachos. The pretzel is very dry - do not order. Just don't go here! So many better restaurants within one hundred feet of this place. If you go here and end up having a less than satisfactory experience, you have only yourself to blame."}
{"text":"I went there as part of a group lunch for a former colleague's retirement lunch.

We went in and were told that our table was on the 2nd floor. We went to the second floor and sat down. We were provided with the menu. I took a quick look at the menu and decided to go with the \"3 Brasseurs Burger\" which was $16+taxes+tip. It took awhile for our group to settle in since we were probably over 50 people.

When the waitress came to take our orders, I mentioned that I wanted the \"3 Brasseurs Burger\". According to the menu, it is hand pressed, fresh 100% beef burger with house-made maple Amber beer sauce, smoked Gouda & bacon. It was garnished with lettuce, tomato, and onion and served with fries. The lunch menu also included either a soup, a salad with house dressing or a mini-deli plate with baguette. I opted for the soup. It also came with a 1/2 pint of beer included (which could be substituted for coffee or soft drink). I opted to go for the beer and took the blonde beer which was one of the 2 recommended beers with this meal.

With such a large group of people, I was somewhat worried about the time since even though I had allocated a maximum of 2 hours and 30 minutes for lunch, I didn't want to be late getting back to work.

Surprisingly even with the large group of people (we occupied almost the entire 2nd floor), my order came very fast. There were a few speeches and photos that happened during the meal. I didn't rush with my meal and spoke with the people at my table throughout my meal.

I looked at my watch and since I had to get back to the office, I went to the waitress and mentioned that I needed my bill as I had to leave. She informed me that she was just printing out all the bills and would bring them in a few minutes. I asked if I could get my bill immediately and pay for it since I needed to leave immediately so I would not be late getting back to work. She gave me my bill and I paid.

All in all, I enjoyed my burger, fries, soup, and beer. Service was also fast once we were all settled in. The only somewhat negative comment that I had was that my friend who was sitting at a different table was offered by his server the option of getting a full pint instead of a half-int for an additional $2 (I believe). the waitress that served my table didn't offer me (or our table) this option."}
{"text":"The beer is the only good thing about this place. The food was HORRIBLE. We ordered the Metere of beer which was delicious and was great to try everything hey offered on tap. It came with a pizza which was disgusting, and we ordered the original poutine and that was gross as well. I would never order food- but like I said, the staff and beer was great!"}
{"text":"Cet avis est pour cet emplacement, pour la bannière voir l'avis suivant (http://fr.yelp.ca/biz/les-3-brasseurs-montreal-2?hrid=2uR7iI_fapF1Ex0o13n9bg).

Superbe emplacement, on brasse vraiment devant vous, du moins le midi. L3B dans le technoparc (bon à côté) offre un menu à prix réduit pour le midi. Très grande surface qui peut accueillir plusieurs groupes. Vous pouvez réserver, ce qui n'est pas une mauvaise idée les jeudis et vendredis. Quoique j'y trouve toujours de la place.

Un excellent choix pour une réunion d'équipe ou avec d'anciens collègues."}
{"text":"After wandering around on a bitterly cold Saturday in Montreal, my friend and stopped in Les 3 Brasseurs.  We needed something to eat after a few hours at the museum, and to refuel for our outdoor walking sessions.

While walking along Rue Saint Paul as most tourists do, we found this place abuzz with activity.  We figured what better way to fuel our caloric needs on such a cold day than with beer and poutine.  I mean, that is what you do when you're in Canada, isn't it?

My companion went with the poutine, and I actually opted for the cheddar soup in a bowl.  I strange choice on my part (I'm not usually into creamy soups), but I felt compelled to have something different and a bread bowl also sounded very appetizing.  I was happy with my decision.  It was exactly what I needed that day.  And did I mention the beer?  We went with the blondes - a perfect choice for me.  As a non-beer drinker, I was pleasantly surprised by this light beer.  There was absolutely no bitterness to it whatsoever, and that's exactly what I had hoped for.

Les 3 Brasseurs was in the perfect place at the perfect time for us.  We normally wouldn't have ventured into a chain restaurant, but as standards, this wasn't bad.  We had a nice time, the food was good, we were warm. Our server was polite, but I did feel that we were rushed out a little sooner than we would have liked.  A crowd was starting to fill in near the door, and that was our indication to hurry up instead of linger over our beers for a few minutes longer."}
{"text":"The house brown ale was okay, the stout on the rotating selection was amazing.  It's nothing that outlandish, but the service is good, and it's a good place to get some beers, poutine, and pub food."}
{"text":"Went with my grandmother as my \"birthday dinner\". We had the charcuterie platter which was delicious and each got the mussels. Although tasty, the portions were large and we were both entirely too stuffed by the end of our meal. Our tab was about $82 (one wine and one beer) and my grandmother gave the poor waiter $90. The waiter kindly accepted the 10% tip and wished us a good evening. I snuck off to give him another $10, props to him for not having called out my grandmother for the poor tipping.

The lost star is because the mussels weren't phenomenal, slightly overprice (but I'm cheap) but MOSTLY because the initial waiter serving us refused to serve us in English. If you don't want to give service in english, maybe you shouldn't be working in a section of town as touristy as the old-damn-port. Le sigh."}
{"text":"Amazing experience! Pub looks actually like a small brewery with all the pipes over the ceiling. Feels really cozy and the European vibe is felt here as well. We've come as 4 adults and had a booth on the back of the ground floor. (there are 2 floors, I believe that the second floor are more for groups). We've ordered the Poutine flatbread as a starter, and it was delicious! Later on we've ordered sauerkraut with sausages, fried chicken with Belgian waffles, lentil and chicken salad and Cesar salad, and everybody was satisfied and happy. Overall, the portions were generous. 
My husband tried their Amber beer and said it was good.

Would recommend and definitely would go to their branch in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Waited forever for a burger that we watched sitting on the counter in the kitchen. Was cold by the time we got it. Beer was mostly foam. Incredibly slow waitress even though the restaurant was pretty quiet. Food was cold."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Our bartender looked like Leelee Sobieski and was really chill and attentive. All the bar staff and most of the servers were really friendly too, with the exception of this one kinda short chick with dark brown hair who had a surly attitude. 

Even one of the bar-backs recoiled when he saw how nastily she responded when I simply asked if the glass she was holding was a \"growler\". She looked at me and was like, \"What?\" So I repeated the question. Then she said, \"I don't know, it's a glass,\" then stormed off. The bar-back and I exchanged glances, like, \"Damn, you mad bro?\"

Came back another night and was served by a very pretty, friendly girl with glasses and red lipstick. 

Anyway, overall experience was really good. It's too bad we had already eaten both times before coming here because I would have loved to try the food. Next time :)

P.S. Get a beer flight (or two), you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the 3 brasseurs burger and the fries were good as well. The beer was ok. Good with the food, but nothing to write home about. As far as service goes, our waiter seemed a bit gruff at times."}
{"text":"Good brewpub.  The dark beer was tasty and well-flavoured with a pleasant acidity.  The flammekuechen (flatbread pizzas) were tasty and filling - I enjoyed the smoked meat version.

Nice place for lunch after wandering around Montreal's Old Town on a cold day."}
{"text":"Decent food. Good beer. Lotsa TV's for sports! Nice bar. Good menu options. I would go there again if i wanted to eat, drink, and watch a game."}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday dinner and the staff was very accommodating for the large group. The atmosphere is really great but the food was a bit overpriced and lacking any real flavor. The best part of my meal was the beer-battered fries which came with a great dip but the main that I had which was the chicken avocado sandwich was just mediocre and definitely not worth $16 bucks. I recommend the place if you aren't looking for any great food but just want a nice place to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"Got lucky and got a table for the habs game! Flamekeuche is very good although a bit pricey. Poutine was nothing life changing but the atmosphere for a hockey night is on point. In sum, good for hockey nights but nothing life changing for a regular night!"}
{"text":"They make their own beer, it tastes fine, the staff is nice and very professional. I had the chicken caesar salad, you should too. Prices are not high, the cheapest beer in town."}
{"text":"C'est toujours un restaurant-bar agréable à aller et la bière est bonne ! Si vous ne coulez pas vous casser la tête et chercher une place pour un 5 à 7, c'est l'endroit idéal! On peut y retrouver des plats pas trop chers et qui ont bon goût (sans être extraordinaire) ! Vous pouvez aussi choisir de partager trois ou quatre entrées et en faire un bon moment !! :)"}
{"text":"Je n'ai pas besoin de vous vanter les 3 brasseurs, ça reste une brasserie populaire que tout le monde aime! Une bonne place à aller si jamais vous avez un spectacle au St-Denis le soir !!

De plus, ils ont rénové l'endroit, encore plus de places qu'avant !"}
{"text":"Je n'ai pas besoin de vous vanter les 3 brasseurs, vous connaissez probablement ! Celui du dix30 est très bien pour une soirée entre amis, une date ou encore un p'tit souper vite fait avant le cinéma ! Les prix sont raisonnables et c'est toujours une b"}
{"text":"Les 3 Brasseurs is a small brewpub chain in Montreal with about 5 locations, with a  new location coming soon in Toronto. They brew 4 main beers, a white, a blonde, an amber, and a brown. They also do quite a few beer cocktails. It sort of reminds me of a French-Canadian version of BJ's Brewhouse in the US. One of their specialties is called a \"flamm,\" which is more like an Alsatian tart than a pizza. These are pretty good, with mostly local cheeses and fresh ingredients as toppings, and with a thin pastry-like crust. They also make dessert flamms. In addition to flamms they have bistro fare, as well as sandwiches, burgers, salads, etc. We stopped by their Ste-Catherine location for lunch one day and each got a sampler of their beers. Vince got a québécoise flamm and their house specialty beer-braised pork shank. I got an order of duck terrine and the mussels provençale. The servings were huge, so it was way too much food. It was all pretty good, but not remarkable. I did like the flamm quite a bit. Service was friendly, and there was a festive sports bar type of atmosphere. I don't feel the need to go again, but it's not bad for some simple, reliable food. I'd probably have given it 4 stars if it didn't pale so much next to all the other excellent places I ate in Montreal."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for some beers and food on the way back from walk in the old port.  I ordered a light Brasseur special pizza, a friend ordered the same another friend ordered a Peppy pizza and one other friend ordered theRoyal Sauerkraut.  Of course the real reason we came here was for some beer!  We ordered the special brew beer which can't remember the name but was great.  We were happy with selection and quality.  Pizza was nice and light and beer was zippy good!"}
{"text":"Walking along Old Montreal, we decided to stop here for some drinks. 

We didn't expect much in terms of service since we were in a touristy, loud, busy bar, we just wanted our order to come when it's supposed to come.

We had the 4-oz glasses of beer with different flavours and the blonde beer, which were both decent. Service ended up being okay, as we actually had a good conversation with one of the bartender ladies. However, it was simply too loud and too crowded for my party to enjoy our drinks that we decided to leave as quick as possible after we're done."}
{"text":"Is a good option is clean and nice place. have a good bar fare. the beer is very good and they make their own beer. the poutine was very good. and the staff was helpful."}
{"text":"Un peu l'usine mais de bonnes bières et de bons cocktails.
Nous y avons seulement pris un verre donc je ne peux juger les plats.
Mais c'est un endroit agréable."}
{"text":"Good outside atmosphere. Good crisp fish n chips. Provincial Mussels fresh and tasty. Poutine was good. Service friendly but a bit slow. Food was slow coming out from the kitchen. They brought out a nice tray of mussels and then they went by...to another table that was seated after ours."}
{"text":"This was our first time in Montreal and walking we came across this restaurant. We ordered the chicken and waffles and the steak along with a sangria and IPA beer. We thought everything was really tasty! Satisfied and portions are decent. The menus are made made like a little magazine which is unique. We would come back."}
{"text":"This chain of restaurants and brew up is a consistent place to eat and drink.   We got a bacon cheeseburger and it was consistent average to below average...like most times we've been there.    The beef patty was kind of dry and the fries were not crispy.     We also got a house salad.  Nothing out of this world.  

We got a nice IPA beer, which is becoming more mainstream in Canada now...that was good.  

We sat outside on the terrace.   Lot of TVs inside showing the games."}
{"text":"Blergh. Go to Cinkos across the street instead. 

People must go here because they're tired of walking and just want to eat. At least that's what we did. 

The seating is very confusing as you can go
Upstairs or Down, though no one was on hand to help us figure out where we could grab a table on a muggy, crowded night. I'm sure plenty of folks get frustrated and walk away. Why is there a line for upstairs and so many empty tables downstairs?

The mussel appetizer was pretty good, though the mussels were on the smaller side. The charcuterie was good. The pork loin was a huge piece of meat that my buddy enjoyed. The salmon was a bit overcooked, bland, and sat on a bed of dry, uninspired white rice. The mixed veggies were fine but the plate as a whole was something you could cook for yourself with a bag of instant rice and a craving for mediocrity. Go here if nothin' else on the strip inspires you.

Service was friendly."}
{"text":"The beer was delicious and reasonably priced. The food was good and despite being packed the service was friendly and the rooftop patio was amazing. Great location and would recommend to others."}
{"text":"Jesus Christ, I've never had such poor service in my life. I visit 3 brewers very frequently and I don't know what's been happening recently but it's not looking good. Highlights of the night:

1. Our waiter had half our orders completely wrong and questioned us about it.

2. When the waiter realized he got the orders wrong he sent the plates back but 2 of us had to wait and let their plates get cold while waiting for the other 2 orders to be remade.

3. We ordered coffees and it took forever to come in. We ordered 2 coffees, they only brought one...But we waited so long that I decided to cancel mine.

3. The whipped cream on the coffee looked like it had gone bad and it was not good to drink. It was grainy and wouldn't mix with the coffee. We sent that back and asked for coffee without any whipped cream 

4. Not a single apology offered through out the night. We just got our bills and took off. 


If you love 3 brewers just skip this location because it was god damn terrible. Slow, inattentive, careless service to say the least."}
{"text":"Great beer Terrible service manager is a complete idiot. I came last night to have beer on terrace and they said they were closed so I went to bar. I came again to have beer on terrace and they said since I was not eating I could not be seated on terrace. Apparently they feel I am not spending enough money to be seated on terrace. The manager claims there is some rule saying I cannot be seated on terrace unless I eat. I had just eaten and I just wanted beer. I'm really pissed off and the manager is an asshole and a useless piece of shit.
I will never come back and they can keep their beer and terrace and stuff it."}
{"text":"Cool little rooftop deck on this brewpub chain. The location is good on Rue Saint Denis in the Latin Quarter. Beers were decent.

One thing to bear in mind for the American tourist is that Montreal is very smoke friendly and although they can't smoke inside any more, you will see smoking on patios and decks. I saw an American girl at an adjacent table bristle when the occupant of the next table lit up a ciggy.

The baked brie appetizer was good, but the service was slooooooow. Also, the tables were so close to each other that I was literally sitting at the next table. 

I love the line that the greeter gave us when we sat, \"You can sit here, but if it rains you are SOL\" - it sounds so much better in French though."}
{"text":"If you enjoy bad food and terrible service then this is the place for you! Our server was to focused on his top knot and sole patch and basically ignored us the entire time we were there."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of Les 3 Brasseurs, their food is really good, they have great beer as well. I've sat at their rooftop kinda terrace on St.Denis and it's so nice there! It's a good location to enjoy the summer, and the weather! I love how 3 Brasseurs is chill, you could go there for anything basically and it's nice for groups as well. However, I wouldn't suggest their sangria though, it was my mistake to get it, and won't get it again. It was more like a juice rather than a coctail. Definetely go there to try their beers and nothing else as drinks."}
{"text":"Food was good but service was horrible. Asked 3 different people for a Coke. After 20 minutes of not receiving a drink I gave up and just asked for a check."}
{"text":"I was in Montreal last weekend to race. Came here with a few friends/team mates to have dinner. We strolled around the town and stumbled upon this restaurant. 
The service was definitely friendly and accomodating. The food was eh...I ordered Les Brasseurs Burger-with cheese, bacon, lettuce, tomatoes, - can't go wrong right?
WRONG. I asked if I can have the burger cooked medium rare and was told it's always cooked the same. That should've been a sign.  Everything about my burger was fine except for the \"meat.\" It clearly wasn't a fresh made beef patty, looked like some compacted processed bits. The best part of our meal with the thin crust pizza we all ordered as an appetizer- that was topped with mushrooms, meat, onions and gruyere. May not consider this the next time we are here."}
{"text":"Good beer, mediocre food, poor service.. so many other spots nearby that are far superior..."}
{"text":"Came with a party of 3 and ate upstairs on the open air deck. It was really nice weather out and we wanted to enjoy the last rays of sunshine. Our waitress showed us to a table that hadn't been cleaned yet so the table was still sticky. She also forgot to bring us one of our drinks.

The food was decent; I had a hamburger (not the most canadian meal out there) and poutine (very canadian). It came out in about 25 minutes which really wasn't a problem. The food was ok.

Service: not great
food: mediocre"}
{"text":"On Yelp, you don't really notice that this place is a chain, but we definitely picked up on the chain-y vibe while there. 

We enjoyed our beer a lot and it was very nice the way the menu explained each kind of beer. It made ordering much easier and took out the guessing game factor. 

The food, however was somewhat subpar. We ordered the duck Poutine, which was fairly tasty, but served rather cold."}
{"text":"On a trip to Montreal, we stumbled upon this restaurant just in need of something quick and nearby. The menu looked interesting and affordable. It's a large restaurant, with outdoor seating and the restaurant itself is pretty open. I ordered the pork shank house speciality, which only ran about $15 so I thought it would be a good portion. It was humungous! Two large pork shanks, both fatty and tender, along with veggie sides (basically just a big piece of broccoli) and fries that I substituted for sweet potato fries. A bit too satisfied, I couldn't finish it all...

Everyone else's dishes looked really tasty, from chicken burgers to the steak. We also shared the appetizer Flammekeuches? which is kind of like a really thin/flat pizza. With bacon, gruyere cheese and onions, it was a nice light snack but only had about 1.5 small pieces each for 10 people.

Overall enjoyable! And they offered to do separate checks, which was convenient."}
{"text":"Une des serveuses est très impolie et agressif en plus ça prend beaucoup pour recevoir de demande 
C'était un terrible expérience pour moi chez eux !"}
{"text":"After walking around Old Montreal we stumbled upon this brewery/restaurant. Even though it didn't have five stars we stopped here because the place was packed! Usually a sign of a packed restaurant means that it is delicious! 

The best thing I had was my beer flight - which I highly recommend getting if you like to try different craft beers. 

The two items that I ordered (a sandwich that I can no longer locate on the menu and a salad) came with onions so i asked if they could not come with onions. Of course when the items go to the table, they both had nasty onions on it.

I should have just gotten a flammekueche because my sister's was delicious.

We also tried ordering the lavender creme brulee..but the waiter told us they haven't been able to serve it for weeks because someone stole the torch..."}
{"text":"Just found out about their happy hour actually (5 dollar pints!) I usually steer clear of this place in the summer because they pack the tables and chairs on the terrasse which leaves you with no elbow room for a game of charades (jk with the charades... but def not comfy enough for me)

We sat inside, filled up quickly around 5:30 and our waitress was super duper nice. 

Didn't eat anything but we got a free basket of \"chips\" and salsa and the seasonal pint was interesting enough. She said all the pints were on special so it's a win for all sorts of taste buds."}
{"text":"We were not impressed with this bar. We stopped in for some beers and some food for a late lunch.

The service was slow, they brought us dirty cups for water and it took a while to get served. 

The food came out cold/luke warm, it was clearly sitting around for a while. 

Nothing impressed us here, wouldn't recommend especially with so many other good spots."}
{"text":"Been here a few times already in the last 2 years. The drinks are good, beer. The sangria here is made mostly of juice then a hint of wine. It's kinda funny to see they bring the pitcher to the table then stir it for you. Ordered the burger, asked for it medium, was told no. MadCow Disease is still a risk ( apparently, ugh scary) 
Service is slow and not attentive. Good for a quick bite and absorbing the cold air conditioning."}
{"text":"This was a great experience for me being in Montreal for the first time for work.  We stopped here for lunch and I really enjoyed my meal.  I had braised pork shanks with their homemade sauerkraut - simply outstanding.  The meat was fall off the bone tender and their kraut is tasty too.   They have a diverse menu so a large party will be able to find something for everyone in most cases.  Can't speak to prices since I did not pay but I would not hesitate to come here again for a meal."}
{"text":"I would have given this place one star except the place has good service.

I had the burger (cooked with \"biere blonde\") with fries and their sampler beers.

The burger was way over-cooked and the bun was pretty hard. I guess this is what they consider toasted.  The fries were actually good though.

As for the beer sampler (there were 4), nothing to write home about especially for a brewery in Canada--land of beer.

Again, the service was good for a semi busy night which was appreciated.  I can't blame the servers for the lack of experience in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Restaurant was always very busy, but the wait time for a table was very short. Food was consistently average - above average but not spectacular. All of the versions of their beer have a little hop to them and A slightly bitter finish.  Had a flamm as my first meal and unfortunately while all the toppings were tasty, the flatbread itself was very soggy. The poutine was delicious on two different occasions.

Service was always polite but what you would expect in a big, busy restaurant."}
{"text":"On a weekend in Montreal, my boyfriend and I stumbled on this restaurant. We went in after looking at the menu and deciding it could be good. The beer was great- they brew it themselves and it had a good flavor. We got poutine and split one of the flatbreads. Everything was absolutely delicious! The wait staff was also very friendly and helpful with tips on where to go around the city. I would come back here on my next trip to Montreal!"}
{"text":"This place is a must-see! The service is good, the beer is good, and the atmosphere is extraordinary! Great music playing, cozy and comfortable construction  (both layout and materials), and an overall welcoming feel. Accept the embrace, Les 3 Brasseurs has a pour with your name on it!"}
{"text":"Je sais pas vraimment quoi lui reprocher donc j'ai mis 5 etoiles. 6 7 dollars la pinte de biere, service rapide, les tables sont aeres , c'est agrables .La musique est pas trop forte c est vraiment cool pour prendre un vert et parler !"}
{"text":"This specific location of Trois  Brasseurs is my preferred apres skating pub. First of all I really like the concept of this brew pub chain. They brew five pretty good beers, they also have beer of the month, seasonal choices as well as beer competition between the different brew pub locations once a year. The tasting flight called \"l'etchétéra\" is a great option to sample their classical beers. The varlet (1 litre glass) may be perfect if you are really thirsty and don't mind the heavy lifting. 

Trois Brasseurs has solid menu with delicious flammekueche choices, some good meat dishes and my beloved popcorn style crusty fried shrimp. What I particularly like in this location is the maxi poutine. You won't find it on the menu, but for an extra of two dollars they will substitute the regular fries with the maxi ones. I have to say this is one of my favourite poutine in town and it has been pretty consistent as quality. Sometimes the person bringing the food will be too much focused on bringing all the dishes together and you may get your plate a little bit cooled off, some other time the waiter may be a little bit distracted and you will end up with something you haven't asked for. Regardless the guys are willing to correct their small mistakes and service is overall ok. 

As this is a pub located in the old port, its atmosphere is quite unique, the pub is housed in one of the old stone walls buildings. The front part of the pub has tall tables and could be drafty during the cold winter months, on the other hand the back part of the pub is sheltered, but the kitchen personnel tends to open some door periodically and introduce more cold  air. The best part to sit is really in the middle of the pub, warm and protected, perfect for those who have decided to freeze on the skating rink or during other outdoor winter activities, and need to warm up. Finally the vibe of this pub is relaxed and this is another reason I like going there. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Good for a stopover on the patio when you're tired and weary. Good for a couple beers. But a bit pricey. And the food is mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Good place for a big group dinner, the food is decent and the beer OK.  

I find when we order a \"Meter of Beer\", we always end up asking for the 2 or 3 kinds that people are OK with.  None of them are really fantastic.

The german food is pretty good, but the Flamekuchen are not as good as they look.

Mainly have only been here because it's one of the few places big enough to host a big group on short notice, but probably wouldn't come here \"on purpose\"."}
{"text":"We were exploring the neighborhood... and couldn't resist stopping here for a drink... a well deserved drink after a full walking day. 

This is a chill, laid back, but really fun brewery. We ordered some bar garb and got some beer (I had something else to drink since I'm not a beer fan)... then we sat ourselves outside by the sidewalk. I seem to remember hopping across the street to check out a food outlet on the opposite side of the street.... I may have returned with some good finds.

In any case, it was interesting to see the tourists go by, see the locals hang in their hood. In fact my friend mentioned that he was going to opt to stay in an apartment here on his next trip just to soak in the neighborhood feel."}
{"text":"Standard sports-bar style restaurant. Service is okay - nothing to be remembered but no problems. 

The food was average - I tried the goat cheese tartine and was underwhelmed. It was a piece of toast with goat cheese spread and a few pieces of arugula. Not really the sort of cuisine you're looking to enjoy when you go out to eat! 

Wouldn't recommend you reach out to eat here but if it's around you and you're hungry - why not."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place again because it is where my boyfriend and I first meet but sadly it wasn't great.

Les 3 brasseurs is a franchise so I never expect much about the food, i like their onion rings and some of their beers. But the last couple of times I went I was really disappointed. The service is never quite right, all the waitress are nice but clearly have too many clients they can not manage your table properly, we have to wait at least 45 minutes to have water and to order our food, then because of the location the kitchen is also really busy so another 40 min for the food to arrived.

The food is not bad if you come for a simple snack, but I really think the burgers use to be good now they are grosse and same for the poutine. The meat is always over cook and there is clearly to much gravy. We took the chance to order the new item, the Poutine flamenkeush (pizza) and that was not great at all, the pizza was super soggy due to the overload of gravy (more gravy than fries) avec the pizza was bland.

Overall, not the best 3 brasseurs I went to. Don't even try to have access to the terrasse it would be worst."}
{"text":"Beer was excellent here, service was good too. We didn't get to try any of the food but for some reason it reminded of TGIFridays. I like how their menu is printed out like a Gazette and the variety is extensive. I also enjoyed the laid back ambiance. I have to say, when it comes to beer, coffee, and wine, Montreal has it together; well done."}
{"text":"Très bon service, surtout avec la serveuse qui s'appelle Anna. Merci mille fois. Bonne bouffe aussi!"}
{"text":"To begin, service is very slow. We have been sitting down for 15min and have not been asked what we wanted to eat or drink yet. Waitress passed our table 4 times already. Food is a bit pricey but we didn't stay we left we waited too long. Waiter saw us leave and didn't even ask us anything he just put our menus away."}
{"text":"After stepping into Montreal soil for the first time in my life (I'm a Jersey girl), I was ready for some delicious French/Canadian cuisine. My friends and I ended up here for our first Montreal meal. I'm very happy we ate here, because this truly set the bar for the rest of the trip.
This is what I assume to be your typical gastropub in Montreal, but we newcomers were overwhelmed by the menu, atmosphere, beef selection, and everything in between. The service was excellent and very polite and accommodating. And the food was fantastic.
I got an open-faced salmon sandwich (or whatever they called it) and I loved every bite. I'm always looking for new ways to enjoy lochs and cream cheese! I really liked this place and it seemed that the company I was with enjoyed it as well."}
{"text":"Great award winning beers. A great variety of micro brews. Also delicious poutine."}
{"text":"Gord and I spent a couple hours walking around Old Montreal this afternoon ... there are a lot of cool old buildings! 

Afterwards we stopped in at Les 3 Brasseurs (3 Brewers) for a couple beer.  We've been to a couple of their locations in Toronto and have had good experiences and have had so-so experiences . 

Apparently it is in one of the first Bank of Montreal sites ... they have been there for about ten years. They make their beer onsite. 

I had a couple of their blondes and Gord had their IPA and their Porter (their neighbourhood beer). Yum! 

Kayla was our server and she took good care of.  I liked that she was able to answer my questions about the building."}
{"text":"Went here on Friday night. fairly busy but we were still able to get seated with a party of 7 pretty quick. I had the 3 Brasseurs sauerkraut and beer sampler. I loved both and thought the prices were very fair here. Ill be coming back here next year for sure."}
{"text":"We stayed one block away from Rue St. Catherine and we just happened into this place after passing up a few pricier spots. It was very busy when we went but we happened to get a nice window seat streetside. Our waitress was very polite and spoke English perfectly,  she was a good help in advising our beer and meal selections. The beer was great, cold and fresh and tasted like craft beer should,  I had the Blonde Ale and my boyfriend had the Amber. The food was also up to par and very flavorful. The French dip sandwich was tasty and we'll cooked. The service was at a reasonable speed comparable to how busy the place was. I would eat there again."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times now.  (Great place to watch the St Patrick's Day Parade!  If you start freezing - Insider's tip- you can watch it while being warm inside and while drinking great beer).  The most recent time was last night.  It was just my friend and me and it was around 5 PM.  It was the prime time for dinner on one of the busiest streets downtown, on a Thursday.  It was no surprise that when we got there, it was super busy.  

The terrasse was packed.  There was room for two but the hostess said it would be really tight, so we decided to just enjoy the air conditioning inside instead.  I honestly wonder how many times the women at the front have to say that the customer has to go around to the terrasse side to see if there's room because they don't have communication with one another.   So.. they can speak to the person above them via communication systems but in this tech age, they can't reach someone 20 feet away?  It was odd.  

Other than that, I love their beers (some are odd- if you're not a fan of IPA just stick to what you do enjoy).

The service has its ups and downs.  I've always had a good experience when our server was male ( and no, it's not just because I'm female).  I've seen some of the females have breakdowns in the middle of service, crashing their dish carts into the glass casings in the middle of the restaurant.  It is really a hit or miss.

The food however- is good.  It's not amazing but if you're looking for a place to have a quick bite,   I usually get the quesadillas and my friends usually get the nachos or salads....  it's nothing to rave about but for $12, you get what pay for.  I have previously tried the Calamari and was unimpressed.  You don't get very much and you don't have the option of getting a marinara sauce like I enjoy; you automatically get the Teriyaki Horseradish Marmalade.

Overall, it's a decent place to get food- it's just not somewhere that I would rave about."}
{"text":"O verão deixou as janelas do bar abertas e as pessoas sorrindo lá dentro. Para a cerveja, para as outras pessoas, para o clima. Boa atmosfera. A atendente nos conduziu para uma mesa alta próxima ao bar centralizado com uns 9 bicos de cerveja fresquinha. Um simpático garçom nos atendeu, em inglês, para pedirmos o Menu de Degustação da Casa, com 5 cervejas. Muito bom!

{"text":"The ambience of Rue St Paul's cobblestones and sidewalk musicians are a beautiful draw on a sunny day.

My burger was very dry, a compressed 

A very traditional poutin was wasted on the oil used for for French fries, which needs a change. 

I had to ask for everything (plate, condiments) even though our waitstaff could see we were sharing food instead of individual orders. And the trainer with my waiter beer blocked my request for a sample. 

I mean it's an okay place but not a return for me, unless  I'm in the areaI, I might stop for a beer."}
{"text":"I visited Montreal for the weekend, and I came here for dinner one night.  It's a nice sports bar with a pretty decent menu.  The food was ok.  I had the spicy sausage and olives flammekeuche which is like a french, thin crust pizza.  I had the chili poutine, too.  This was very good - just like chili cheese fries.  The brie burger was also pretty good.  They make all the beers on site, so I got a flight.  The white beer was my favorite!  The service was good, too."}
{"text":"I can't even... Blown away by the poor service of waitstaff AND management AND kitchen! I visit 3 Brasseurs locations throughout Quebec and this is the only one I ever have issues with. Last visit was the reason I am posting though...

KICKED OUT BY POLICE AND TOLD NEVER TO RETURN because on our first beer we chinked glasses and one was still too hot from the dishwasher and broke spilling beer all over my laptop and friends expensive coat. I asked for assistance and the Director Sam told us to be more careful because we just broke a glass. This was untrue and he had mistaken us for another table so he apologized. But then when our appetizers were set down on the table the Manager Alex told us that the waitstaff did not want to serve us and he IMMEDIATELY asked us to leave. 

When we asked why he said it does not matter and began shouting \"THIS IS MY RESTAURANT AND IT DOESN'T MATTER WHY -- I AM ASKING YOU TO LEAVE! THIS IS A PRIVATE ESTABLISHMENT AND NOW YOU ARE TRESPASSING!\" I even have a video of him doing this. Then the \"Director Sam\" came out and said \"We are backing up the waitstaff decision and you must leave\" and he called the police.

So, we waited for the police to arrive and they were completely baffled as to why we needed to leave but did politely inform us that it is the law. We immediately went to the nearby Keg where you can expect to be treated like an upstanding citizen.

Other than that -- the last 4 visits our drinks were wrong, the food was wrong, we were overcharged, the kitchen staff was brand new, the management was consistently buying us drinks to compensate; and because of a HEALTH CODE VIOLATION I spotted they took $100 off one of our visits.

My advice: visit any other 3 Brasseurs location if you want to experience well-priced beer and decent quality pub food at above-market pricing. The service is consistent with most restos in Montreal but if you don't get EVICTED then you may still have a good time."}
{"text":"I will only speak for the drinks. The mojitos are very good. Their microbrews are decent too."}
{"text":"Lol I always come here on weeknights after 11 or 12 if I want to grab a quick drink with friends. Their blonde beer was actually quite good, and this comes from a non beer drinker. Anyways they have a good collection on dark choices for JD remy martins or cognac. The bar upstairs is huge with more rooms for people to sit around in cozy booths. I never really had food here as kitchens always closed by the time arrive, but from what my friends rave its good. Overall a good place to come hit for the location around on weeknights :)"}
{"text":"Me fascinó, la comida es excelente y la cerveza de la casa es sencillamente una delicia para el paladar! Excelente lugar para disfrutar con los amigos"}
{"text":"I am in Montreal for the first time for a conference. I am a big fan of pubs in the states, so naturally thats the type of place I sought out first. I've been to a few so far this week. Les 3 Brasseurs (the 3 brewers) is one of my favorites so far. All the servers / bartenders speak English and accept USD. The food is good. Try any variation of the poutine and you won't be disappointed. The beers are quite good, too. I've found that many Canadians don't prefer very bitter beers, but I do....so I was a bit skeptical in trying the IPA, but it turned out to be similar to an American IPA, so I was happy. There are at least 2 locations of this place in Montreal...and somehow I've ended up at both. It is spacious and a unique looking atmosphere. Fun!"}
{"text":"Not a good time. We were seated upstairs, which was fine. We ordered drinks & food. My buddy's Rum & Coke included a screw. After reporting it (and explaining that we didn't want anything comp'ed) we were given a stare-down by their security from across the bar while the manager & waiter discussed the situation. No idea how a screw got into his drink. 

Food was ok, normal pub food. I didn't try the beer, which is likely the draw for this pub. We ate & left feeling like we weren't welcome."}
{"text":"Scouring the Montreal day for the first time, we ventured in here for some food after a long 8 hour drive.  

I didn't expect this to be a pub, which is basically what it is.  The menu is in French, so I suggest knowing some.  Or do what me and my friends did, and pick things that we thought we knew.  I got the crevette frites because I thought \"frites\" meant fries (for an appetizer).  Well that was popcorn shrimp.  Even though it wasn't what I thought it was, it was really good.  I then got the New Orleans pizza, which is a flatbread.  It looked like nachos to me.  I thought it was good when it was hot, but eat it fast, because when it cools off, it isn't that good.  

They have their own beers, a happy hour from 5-7 on 2 of their beers (the amber and the blond), which is half off.  I wouldn't say to come here, but it's not bad."}
{"text":"Came here on St. Patrick's Day because we were looking for a bar where we could just get a drink and chill.

We ended up sitting at the bar, and from there we could see all of the TVs and other customers. The bartender was fairly attentive, but kept pressuring us to order food. I'm not sure why, but he asked about 3 times and even though I said we weren't hungry yet, he put the order in anyway. Well, since the poutine was there we ate it and it was decent. The beer was good too, this place is kind of a microbrewery, I later found out that it's a small chain with locations in Ontario and Québec.

Good place if you're looking for a normal sports bar and just want to relax for a bit."}
{"text":"La bonne brasserie bien connue des montrealais, plusieurs succursales, j'ai une préférence pour celle au coin de crescent ou le service est nettement mieux! La nourriture est bonne, simple, le choix idéal pour les soirées entre amis et les desserts sont très bons dont le cheesecake et la gaufre. Les choix de cocktails et bières sont diversifiés et plaisent à un grand nombre."}
{"text":"A brasserie should be judged atmosphere, menu and beer.  Les 3 Brasseurs delivers on all of those elements, especially the beer.

A friend and I had just arrived to town after a long drive from Boston, and needed to find something in a pinch.  It's conveniently located 2 blocks from our hotel, and even on a busy Friday night, we were seated right away.

All of the beers we had were not only delicious, but actually impressive.  The food (fish and chips, beef bourguigon) was also quite good. 

The service was prompt and friendly, even for a couple of crass Americans like us.

All in all, I'd recommend this place in a heartbeat.  If you're looking for a quick bite, a great beer in a convenient location, you really can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Great find in old city. After an entire day of hiking up Mont Royal and back down into the downtown area... I was tired, cold and ready for food & drink!

Their beer was delicious. I got the blonde, boyfriend got the red. I preferred mine over his b/c I'm not a big fan of hops... and let me tell you, the blonde was delicious. We like beer a lot and can say this beer was outstanding.

The food was good. We got the poutin prepared Quebecois style and one of their \"pizzas\". The pizza was fine. Thinking I was being \"cool\" I told the waitress we did not need an English menu so it was a surprise that the pizza did not have red sauce. Just cheese, peppers & sausage. It was still good and I was hungry, but I might have considered something a little more filling had I known.

Our waitress, Emily, was great too. Very nice and was helpful pointing us in the direction of the Metro and gave us a GREAT recommendation for a dinner spot near our hotel (see my review of Barraca).

Lastly, this spot was huge, lots of wood, tv screens and would be great for groups, kids & hoards of men lol. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"We were up in the Latin Quarter for a night away while the all nighter En Lumiere Festival was happening so it was quite busy.  We got to sit at the bar and the bartenders were very funny since they found out we were from Vermont the mecca of micro brew.  We will admit their beer is just okay.  Needs some more hops.  However their Black IPA was awesome and we could get a full pitcher.  We had their Short Ribs Flammekueche and of course some poutine.  Both were very good.  Yes it is a chain in Canada but their food is good and well priced especially with the US $ being strong."}
{"text":"Not bad Gastropub. Nice ambiance. Has a sports bar / cool underground lounge feel. They have a few tvs with sports on. 
Had the duck confit poutine as well beer braised short rib. With beers of course. 
The beer braised short rib was somewhat tender and for the price wasn't bad. The poutine was pretty good. Really rich with the duck meat, fat , cheese curds and gravy over fries. 
Had the waffle with ice cream and a brown beer caramel sauce which was really good. I would give this place another try next time I am in town."}
{"text":"I've heard of lot of bad things about \"Les 3 Brasseurs\" over the last few years but never had the pleasure to visit a location until I did last night. I'll be honest... reading reviews of the downtown location as well as well as other 3 Brasseur locations honestly had me hovering on the \"no\" option to the party invite earlier this week.

Let's put our cards on the table as speak honestly, if you're coming here expecting top quality food you will most likely be disappointed. If you're here for a \"5 a 7\" and want to taste genuine decent beer made in-house then you're in for a treat. 

Walking in, I found the decor modern yet warm. The area was spacious and the seating comfortable.

I didn't order any appetizers but ordered a chicken burger with some homemade white beer. Firstly, the beer was exceptional and I would come back to have some more. The chicken burger however was pretty mediocre, with a drought of condiments to be had (I shouldn't be asking for mayo and getting 1 packet). Truth be told, I've had much better chicken burgers in my life. The side order of fries was presented in this small sample cup that obviously was placed in a fashion to look gastronomic but instead came off to me as being very cheap as a tiny side order of about 20 fries wasn't good enough to accompany a $14 mediocre burger.

For desert I ordered their french waffle that came with ice cream and a cappuccino. The french waffle was tasty and hit the spot after a bland burger experience. The cappuccino was pretty bad as it was tiny,  far too strong and barely had any foam on top.

The service was friendly, quick and efficient until a gentleman kindly asked us to leave since we stopped providing them profits after engaging in a most significant group discussion for an hour after our desert. Was it rude? No, but it was a bit shocking to be asked to leave when it's nearly 10 PM but there were patrons at the door.

The price range is about average but be careful as it can quickly add up."}
{"text":"Having driven the long jag from southern Maine to Montreal, I checked into my hotel and was pretty much dead on my feet, and several nearby eateries had already closed for the evening.

Luckily, my hotel was around the corner from this.  The menus are bilingual, which is a nice consideration for the exhausted yankee, but I seem to have absorbed enough French over the years to be able to order poutine and a house beer in the native tongue.

Ah, at last, Real, Quebec poutine, Sure it was from a chain, and the beer was too hoppy and over-proofed, as Montreal beer seems wont, but seldom has an appetizer been as satisfying as that LTB poutine.

The flatbread pizzas were quite tasty as well. Something about the Canadian cheese just sends them from chain-good to actual good. While my dinner was more by necessity than choice, I was quite happy with it."}
{"text":"Solid microbrewery with great food. The poutine was outstanding (definitely recommend upgrading to the beer fries) as well as the salads. The beer complimented the food well. Service was friendly albeit a bit on the slower side."}
{"text":"I settled into a seat at the huge island bar nearby to a large screen TV hanging from the ceiling to catch a b-ball playoff game and get a bite. 

Their newspaper style menu lists a staple (ie. keep-it-simple) beer selection that includes color (coded) dots indicating pairing suggestions. If that wasn't enough the stainless steel tanks are in clear view, which reminds you are in fact in a brew pub, and the many menu items fit that moniker well.

Did I mention their beer is fairly priced compared to the average, and probably because they can deliver it right across the room without a truck.

Their selection of \"Flammekueches\" (a regional European style pizza) is quite extensive and with many topping combinations will suit your mood or craving. They seem to be a specialty and the portion is more than enough for one person - in other words you could share one and a salad with a few beverages and maybe have enough room for dessert. 

Since I mentioned dessert, they have that too. The cinnamon doughnut with ice cream fits just right with an after dinner coffee (in my opinion, so try your own combination and let me know).

One other standout was the above average friendliness and efficiency of the hostess, manager and bar staff. Moreover, in a touristy area, this is not always the case. Surely a topic to debate, but for now why take away from what this group of staff did on a quiet night where they could in theory  \"punched out\" early. With all the area competition, this gets two thumbs up."}
{"text":"This bar and pub was very close to the hotel where I stayed.  The food is great for pub food.  The chevre was delicious and the chicken European sandwich was just good.  The location is excellent and it has two large patios which face bustling streets.  The service was great as the waiter took his time go through the multiple beer options from this microbrewery .  We sat at the bar as the upstairs dining area seemed a bit stuffy.

Overall a great place to meet friends for casual food on a weekend night in this area."}
{"text":"Food was good overall, except grilled salmon was a bit overcooked. Veggies were abundant in this plate. Loved it. 

I like the ambiance there and service is fast. One thing I really appreciate is that kitchen closes late."}
{"text":"Originally we were supposed to visit Cinko across the street but it was SUPER busy s we decided to go with something we know, Les 3 Brasseurs or The 3 brewers as Ontarians may know it. Though not as bad, it was still super packed and we waited around 30 minutes to get a seat. No complaints though- its better than waiting outside in the cold for who knows how long for the place across the street. 

The menu is quite the same across all locations. Its pub fare like burgers, sandwiches and even their famed flammkeuche (similar to a thincrust pizza) but also cooked dishes and meat/cheese platters. I would say that the quality of their food is very good. On their own, both the burger and flammkeuche were very good...but I took things up a few notches...

TIP: Split a Chilli peppy flammkeuche and a bacon and cheese burger with someone. Cut the burger in half, cut the flammkeuche in half. Now each of you place the 1/2 burger in the 1/2 flammkeuche and roll it like a burrito. Not my proudest moment to be honest, but it was so good! lolol

Also, the fact that we split a 5L beer and it costed us less than $6 each is amazing. We all had around 4 glasses of beer!!! It could have easily costed us $20-25 each elsewhere."}
{"text":"What I hate about Yelp is that there's no Half stars. 3 stars is definetly a understatement of this place, and 4 stars is overated. 3 brasseurs as a local montrealer is a place you go when you don't want to think about a specific place to go. IMHO it's now more and more trendy, based on a franchise model that's working pretty well. They have home-made beer which are quite honest and good. I went back yesterday, had some beer. great service, and even if it wasn't really fast, it was ok. I think that this franchise should grow more and more and continue to establish a solide client bases but overall what I hate about this place it's that it's too big. There's too many people, and sometime if you don't feel listening to this repeating electro-jazz fusion crap (I like Jazz, but not that noise). This is the only reason why you can't consider this place has a solide 4 stars or 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Not a fan, OK beer, but the service was a little snooty. We had a drink and left."}
{"text":"We came for the drinks but we stayed for the beef. 
This place has literally the best beef I've tasted in a burger and it arrived at my table 8 minutes after I ordered it from our most helpful server, Hannah! Literally, she was phenomenal. 
I ordered the 3 Brasseur burger with the maxi fries. My girlfriend ordered the Brie Blue burger. While the flavors on my burger were perfectly balanced, the blue cheese was overpowered by the balsamic reduction on the brie blue burger.
As for the drinks, we were less than thrilled with the new editions to the beer cocktails menu made with Les 3 Brasseurs' white and blonde beers brewed on-site. The Moscow mule I ordered was missing the signature sweetness of a ginger beer. The strawberry rhubarb seemed more like a glass of white beer with a slight aftertaste of strawberry. The next time we come for burgers we'll plan to order IPAs.
Pro tip: Even if the line looks long, don't worry. On a Saturday night during Nuit Blanche we got a table for 2 in less than five minutes."}
{"text":"Their own beer was just alright. I don't particularly find it great or come back for more. On the other hand, the flatbread pizzas and charcuterie were amazing."}
{"text":"Arrived in Montreal this afternoon, we were starved and looking for somewhere to eat, we choose this place and we were not disappointed the menu as a newspaper was very cute idea,it was a wonderful lunch, we both order the flat bread and it was very good, this was a true flatbread super thin.. It is a large order for one person you will more then likely have left overs, to re-live the lovely lunch again :) 

The service was good and atmospheres was cool and relaxed price was reasonable felt like we got value for our dollar for sure, I hope to have a couple pints before the end of our trip :)"}
{"text":"Ok, this is a chain. Normally, we try to avoid chains when we travel but it was hot and we just wanted a beer. Well, they definitely have beer here. It's not great beer, but it's beer. I ordered the Brown and it wasn't bad. My bf ordered the IPA and it wasn't bad either. I feel like this is probably a good place to take people that are not fully into craft beer but they dabble or you're trying to convert them from the mainstream stuff.

We didn't order food, but it looked good as it came out when other people ordered it. We sat at the bar and the bartender wasn't very friendly at all. In fact, I wanted to order another beer but he was kinda rude and I didn't want to tip him more than I had to. Oh, and also he never really checked back in with us so when we finally got his attention we were annoyed and just wanted to close out.

This place served its purpose."}
{"text":"Had a late night dinner here on a Sunday night with my sister. I give 4/5 because they ran out of so many dinner options :/
Both items that my sister and I wanted to order were sold out which was no fun.
However, we shared a flamm pizza item. It is very large so it is nice to share. It was so good. It is extremely flat. 
I also order the raspberry beer. The drink is made with raspberry syrup and has a yellow beer that they brew. My sister had a sangria that is also mixed with the light beer. The drinks were delicious and only $5 Canadian dollars.
Overall, the place looks really cool. It is a fun brewery but come earlier in the weekend so all the food options are available :)

Also, the wait staff was great and food came quickly!"}
{"text":"The food was good. I had the \"Pork Poutine\" and the \"Limonade Framboisé\", but the wait time was crazy. If I didn't have the brilliant idea to buy a croissant and a coffee on my way there I would have probably passed out waiting for them to take my order. But it's not my first time there so I can definitely say that they were overwhelmed today. Sorry didn't have the time to take pictures I was too hungry for that. It's only after my second drink I remembered to take a picture:)

Well want to update my review today because I had an amazing customer service today. My friend and I had the pleasure to be served by the friendly Gabriel."}
{"text":"Came here on st pattie's day and they were chill about some people in my group being under 18yrs, the wait wasn't too long and we got to stand around a nice barrel
service was quite good and my waitress was very pretty :D 
I ordered the duck confit poutine (AMAZING) and most of my friends got the pulled pork, and they all said it tasted amazing. for the pretty low price, the food is very tasty and filling, and the beer is good
overall a nice atmosphere and good eat, would recommend to most of my friends"}
{"text":"No matter what city I go to, priority #1 is finding local breweries or brew pubs. Not only does Les 3 Brasseurs have an extensive beer menu, they offer poutine with several different topping choices. The menu also features colored dots next to each item to assist with been pairing, something that is VERY rare in my experience.Sitting right in the heart of Old Montreal, it was busy, but it was easy to get a seat for lunch on a Saturday afternoon in March. 

If you take nothing else from this review, take this: GET THE BEER-BATTERED MAXI FRIES! Whether it's in your poutine or as your side, make the upgrade, you will not regret it. All of the food we had was great. My flammekueche (basically a flatbread) was wonderful, my wife's burger was a little overdone, and our friends were pleased with their choices.

Order a beer flight, and make sure you get the neighborhood and feature brews. These are the major point of interest about the company as they try to keep up the tradition of every town/location having it's own beer (something I noticed very much in action when I was in Germany last year). 

This is a fun, family-friendly, laid-back brewpub where I could have easily eaten every day: lunch, dinner, or late-night. les 3 Brasserurs will definitely feature in future trips to Montreal."}

{"text":"I've had both good and bad experiences at a few of the 3 Brasseurs locations. Overall, the beer is pretty good. I'm not a big beer drinker, so those who are really invested in it probably won't be too impressed. For me, it just has to be cold and crisp. Their pitchers are also a great deal for a group of friends going out.

The food has been tasty. I like the flamms, but it's better to just consider them as flatbread pizzas. I love the spicy sausage and pepper one, and it has been consistently delicious. I've also had really nice chicken Caesar salads, they throw some bacon in, and the lettuce has always been crispy and fresh. I had an incredible dessert once: just a simple apple pie and ice cream. So delicious. Unfortunately, it was seasonal and it wasn't there the next time I went back. I didn't expect this place to have great desserts, but I think they do.

Other times, the food has been bad. I had a chicken sandwich that was bland and missing (expensive) ingredients, namely the avocado. I tried a bite of a mac n cheese sandwich and how on God's green earth can you take the cheese flavor out of cheese?! Completely flavorless.

Service has also been hit or miss. I've had friendly, attentive service and I've had a waitress basically refuse to bring my visiting family English menus."}
{"text":"After a job well done at work, my boss offered to treat my partner and I to dinner wherever I chose. Since my first experience here was great, I opted to come back for some good food and amazing beer.

We were seated after a little wait time, as it was a busy evening. Our waiter hurriedly brought our menus and left us for far too long. I had to hail him back to give him our order, not to mention wait for far too long for our appetizers, then in an ironic twist, main course, minutes after our appetizers. Not cool! The waiter was detached and really had a \"could care less\" attitude. I asked him about several of their house brewed selections, and his answers were brief, without much knowledge or description. 

After getting our main course, he never came back to check on the food, refills, etc. He was far more attentive to the pretty young girls across from us. Very unprofessional, to the point where I e-mailed them from their website. They sent me a $20.00 gift card, which I'm still afraid to use, since even with a $20.00 discount, that level of service will still be a rip-off.

They're lucky to get a 2 star, because the beer actually was amazing!"}
{"text":"I've been to 3 Brasseurs all over town a bunch of times even though I find the food and beer just alright. 
I probably will be back because I like the atmosphere and service. Even when it's happy hour, waiting times are never too long.

The beer itself is good, I like the blonde or the white best- their red has a bitter aftertaste and their stout is just too heavy for me.
Their beer cocktails are interesting, you can have them mixed with sprite, grenadine, shot of whisky, lemon liqueur etc. 

Food actually kind of sucks. They rarely ever have specials or change their menu, I find it so bland. Their \"pizza\" like dishes are lackluster. They used to have some with chicken as a topping and it was removed from the menu, no clue why as it was the only good one. Crust is too thin, cripsy like a cracker or soft like wet pita depending on the day...

Their burgers are ok, the beer battered one in particular, but fries are frozen and just so flavorless. They serve everything with that mustard/mayo sauce to mask their lack of flavor.
They serve beer battered thick cut fries as an appetizer dish, but you cannot ask for it as a side, instead of regular fries,  the waitress told me they are already individually portioned, so frozen, as a basket appetizer and it would be too much with a burger or anything else I was getting.

The wraps are a real mess, I've tried their avocado chicken wrap as well as a bbq chicken and it was always steaming hot with a soggy center, mushy pita. Looks like it came straight out of the microwave..

Fish and chips another awful mess, fish incredibly oily and soggy.

Their chicken brochette dish would be the best I had of the bunch but for 14$ the portion is incredibly small. I always like to replace my fries with a side of rice and unfortunately it looks like they only give you 3 spoonfuls. Once, their green beans were undercooked, hard, to the point of being raw.

I don't come here for the food, neither should you, unless you just want a burger or nachos- A couple drinks or place to hang after work is what it's for."}
{"text":"Good place hangout with friends, if you love to drink then this place is good for you. You can taste some different beers.

Their food is not bad, but depends. Same order you can taste various flavor if you go different days. So I guess they change their chef.

I like the place for the look. It's a place you should try at least once."}
{"text":"Came to this one with my friends. Compare to others. Everything is almost the same.  Maybe smaller than others but it's ok.

Le Jarret de Porc is delicious with 6 beers sample. 

They got a big TV on the middle of the wall with different stations. You can enjoy multi show at same time if you got a good spot to sit."}
{"text":"Only stopped in for beer. Oh boy do over they have good beer! 3 sizes @ decent prices! Choose to sit inside at bar.  Great space great bar. Friendly staff.  Old world ambiance.  plenty of high tables. We didn't order because we just ate  but Flatbread  looked really good . Can accommodate large parties. Definitely a place to hang out in with friends or solo.  A` votre sante`   Just  my opinion ."}
{"text":"I am a regular at 3 Brasseurs. It's a nice place to go with clients or friends. Their beers are pretty good - never life changing, but always good. The menu is overall good, but not spectacular. The Flamms are indeed good, easy to eat and never too filling because they are so thin, but the rest of the menu is... Bof. Burgers are typically overcooked. I'd recommend if you're in the mood for pub food with drinking buddies."}
{"text":"We were looking for some new place after the museum and knew St Catherine street had lots to choose from.  We saw this place and decided to give it a try.  Great flat bread pizzas and appetizers.  They have a huge menu and we enjoyed everything that we ordered.  I think this place is good for drinks and after hours libations."}
{"text":"3 brasseurs burger is good. It has maple syrup in it; gives it a nice balance of sweet n salty. Our server was really friendly and accommodating too. He asked us if we want our bill split even though we didn't ask abt it."}
{"text":"My friend and I came in during lunch time, on Thursday. Keep thought it will be a quick lunch. But I was dead wrong. It was a horrible experience, terrible service. The waiter is in hurry ( I think they need more staff) but it was a Thursday afternoon. So I keep it slide. The foods are average, nothing special. I order a Grilled Chicken and Avocado sandwich. The breads are too dried and over cooked. Chicken was too salty for my taste. 
Big disappointment."}
{"text":"The beers are excellent. I had the amber beer (much like a belgian ale like Leffe). The food is also great. I've had the smoked salmon flamm with capers and cheese. Most recently I had the alcasienne flam, which, had slices of kielbasa, sauerkraut and gruyere. It was good but I wish it had some sort of sauce since it was a but dry. The poutine, however was awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Les Trois Brasseurs is a great spot to go if you're looking for the sure thing. You're not going to leave Les Trois with a different perspective on life or what it means to have a good meal. However, they are sure to offer something that you'll enjoy, they have a good selection of beverages to choose from, and the service is solid. The place was packed the night I visited and from the looks of things everybody was having a great time. The location is perfect and you really can't go wrong with Les Trois."}
{"text":"We didn't know what to order so we decided on the 6 beer flight.  We liked the Blanche, the Local, the Munich and the Rousse the best.  It was all delicious.  We decided to top it all off with a Blanche mixed with maple whiskey, called Sortilège.  I would definitely recommend that."}
{"text":"The Flamm (flat bread w/ cheese and toppings) was really good and so was the poutin (fries with cheese curds and gravy) but I agree w/ Holly T. this place was like corporate chain acting like a local pub or micro brewery. I probably won't go back to Les Trois Brasseurs just because of the corporate-feel of the place.

They have four beers they make; a white, an amber, a brown and a blonde beer. The prices were sort of middle of the road prices, not super affordable but not overpriced either. All in all, just skip it."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying when I first started coming to this location, I was less then impressed. Then last year some dramatic changes happened and it has become our go-to establishment for our friends and our family.

The service and staff is incredible, the beer is always cold, and the food has made an incredible turn around from the stale and bland from just a few years ago. Salad, burgers, Choucroute 3B and the pizza dishes are all recommended.

Incredible turnaround and highly impressed with all the changes that have occurred."}
{"text":"I loved this place. The beer is excellent, light atmosphere, Big screens, quick seating, and the food makes no excuses for what it is. My wife and I have had 4 dishes here and my favorite by far is the French dip. It doesn't need dipping, it's wet already and is full of flavor! Horseradish sauce, tomatoes but the baguette it comes on is perfect, just the right amount of crispy crust, warm yet soft, like Cuban bread just a little lighter. It's perfect paired with the white beer."}
{"text":"Service 0!!!! Déplorable. Arrache le menu, balance les plats, me tape sur l'épaule pour me demander ma carte bancaire. Grosse différence avec le 3 brasseurs sur ste catherine qui est plus que correct en service + nourriture! Ici, cornet de patates douces commandée, on m'apporte 3 frites qui se battent en duel dans l'assiette et en plus congelées...Essayez! Je vous assure vous serez ravis du serveur blasé, on le repère vite."}
{"text":"Not on the top of my list of micro- breweries in the city but it is adequate and the food is more than decent. The strange thing is they happen to make the best Long Island Tea I have had anywhere to date, go figure gotta go to Montreal for a LLIT, who knew. This particular location is in the Old City and is a convenient stop to make as your stroll the area and find yourself in need of an ale refresher, lunch, heck even a dinner, I don't think you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"Came here 2 or 3 times during my trip to Montreal in July.  Their specialty is beer, but I actually don't drink beer, I had their Pinot Noir wine (they only had one), which was fine.  The rest of the people I was with loved the beer which is why we kept coming back.  It's in a very central location near lots of shops/hotels/etc.  The first night I ordered some hot wings.  I'm used to the buffallo wings in America, and honestly these wings didn't match up.  They just weren't spicy, but overall they tasted good.  Good enough for me to eat the whole plate of 'em!  Another night I ordered garlic bread with cheese on top, and my friend ordered french fries.  The garlic bread was pretty good, but the french fries were exceptional!  It's funny to rave about fries, but honestly, they were great.  They tasted more like potato wedges, but they were in the typical fry shape.  Very flavorful!  

The waiter/waitresses were all very nice.  We were at the bar the whole time, and we never had to wait long to order or be served, and they were fun to talk to :)  If there were a Les 3 Brasseurs in America, I'm sure it'd be one of my go-to spots!"}
{"text":"it was roughly twelve thousand degrees out and my husband and I were in serious need of some air conditioning and cold beer. It really wasn't even that cold in the place and I asked if they had AC on, but it was comfortable for a short while. The beer was good, not great. I thought the blonde version had a nice fruity note to it and the brown beer was described as my husband as \"okay.\" 

My chicken wrap sandwich was nearly inedible. After a couple bites, I had to stop. The nachos were....nachos. Nothing more to say here. There are probably much better places to eat but I wouldn't say no to stopping in for a drink."}
{"text":"Was the only place with the kitchen open late on a Saturday night , service was really good and the food taste very well !"}
{"text":"American tourist walking around Montreal looking for a place to grab lunch.  Saw a good amount of people inside so thought it would be decent.

Talked to the host in english, who sat us at a table, but he gave us menus entirely in French.  Tried to get the attention of 4 different servers for an English version of the menu with no luck.  Took 10+ minutes for server to finally come and ask if we wanted drinks and give us new menus.

Waited 20+ minutes for someone to take our order and no one ever came.  We ended up asking for the check and leaving to head somewhere else."}
{"text":"I had given this place another shot after being slightly disappointed in the past.

PROs
Good portion sizes
Good beer selection

CONs
SLOW service - means beers and burgers are served above and below ideal temperatures. This was the same issue as last time(s). It affects every aspect of the experience and kills the visit all together.
Anything outside the burger is expensive considering the food is \"pretty good\"

OVERALL
I gave 2 stars because this is still a decent place to have a beer and watch a game but, since this is a full menu, I'm holding it to a higher standard."}
{"text":"I went for supper there with two friends then went to the movies and came back alone to get a drink. Server couldn't care less... Waited 10 minutes to be served at the bar... It seems that when you're in a group you are more likely to get service. I wouldn't recommend that place if your alone or wait to friends to arrive (also happened previously)."}
{"text":"When some of the others in our group kept talking about this awesome microbrewery where we were going to go to dinner, I wasn't expecting a chain.  But that doesn't mean that it didn't have good brews and food.  It just wasn't what I was expecting.

We had a group of about 8 so it took a few minutes before they were able to find a table for us but our waitress was good with getting us all set up (although she did forget to bring me my water).  Prices are fairly reasonable but I didn't find the menu all that inspiring.  I wasn't feeling well so I was a bit jealous that my dining companions all ordered a sampler of their brews.  

I ordered the Euro-Sandwich which was grilled chicken, grilled zucchini, topped with cranberry salsa and brie in a ciabatta bread, served with fries for about $12.00.  It was good, but nothing to really write home about.  I was hoping for more cranberry but it was a pretty small dose."}
{"text":"This location on St. Catherine is simply a better choice for this chain. The seating was efficient. Our server was prompt (despite how busy it was), and both personable and courteous! His recommendations for steak (and their preparation) was great, and we were immensely satisfied! The creme brûlée was not as expected, but it was decent. Not a bad experience at all."}
{"text":"I have reviewed Les 3 Brasseurs  before and this one was no different. I will start with the good stuff, when you come here you know exactly what you are getting, nice beer,  a place for huge groups, and reasonable food. I also liked the fact that each restaurant has a different local beer so that is a nice twist.
Now for the negative part of the review:
This is a place that is around beer BUT Montreal has Amazing beer places so this one is just OK, I would not come here just for the beer. As I said the plus of this place is that is is perfect for huge groups which also means the atmosphere is not amazing. If you are looking for a cool pub this is a restaurant style place so go some place elese. If you are looking for a cool restaurant they serve mainly pub food so go someplace else. If you are going out with a bunch of friends (lets say all the people from your work, or a running group or just your hockey bodies) this is THE perfect place."}
{"text":"A simple idea but well executed - brewpub/sportsbar with good food (a specialty is  Flammekueche - an Alsatian dish meaning literally \"Flame cake\" - or in mainstream French \"tarte flambée\", which is a similar to a pizza but without the tomato-centricity).

Good selection of well kept beers too."}
{"text":"beer sample

as soon as we sat at the bar the bartender handed us a sample of their pumpkin spice beer... which was delicious! and I sure did order a full sized one. I think this is a popular little brewery in Montreal, I noticed them in a couple different locations. 

we just wanted somewhere cool to kill about 30 minutes while waiting on friends and got lucky with this place! the staff was fun, and dressed in costumes (it was Halloween weekend). the beers were delish and decently priced. from what I could see the food looks great but I've been fooled before by great looking food. I really wanted to venture back over to this micro brewery later in my trip but just never got the time. my short visit there was awesome though."}
{"text":"I think 3.5 is reasonable.  Was wondering around Ville-Marie and looking for lunch and this was the first decent thing we could find so we stopped here. It looks like a regional microbrewery chain, complete with vats and dressed up brewers on display by the front entrance. 

We tried the open-faced sandwiches - me, salmon & shrimp; him, goat cheese and tomato. Both came with salads. He got a pint of their Oktoberfest special, I stuck with water. The food was fine, crispy bread, can't really mess up smoked salmon, and the capers so big, they looked mutant. 

Really big place, 2 stories. Clean bathrooms. Service attentive, but not hovering. Accepts credit cards. Happy hour specials where the pints are priced as half-pints. I think it was ok to try, but I don't think I would make this place a destination."}
{"text":"I had expectations...maybe that was my problem. Beer wasn't bad, but food was average at best. My burger only came well-done (trust me when I say that I insisted on Med-Rare), but you can't get ground beef done any other way than WELL DONE in Montreal. Poutine was average as well...definitely much better places to go if you want some good poutine.

Only thing good about this place was the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch on a beautiful, but very busy Saturday afternoon.  Service was a little slow but the outdoor patio seating made the time fly by.  Tried the amber beer and was not disappointed!  Enjoyed the cassoulet and some onion rings for the main course.  All delicious, especially the onion rings!  I doubt I will ever have the occasion to return to Montreal but if we do, we would certainly look this place up again!"}
{"text":"Montreal really is a beautiful city.

As a native Bostonian, it's fun to go up to our northern frenchy neighbors and harrass/enjoy everything they have to offer.

I've been to this establishment, specifically the one on Crescent/Ste Catherine, several times.
The food is good and the beer is great. They get four stars for having insanely hot waitresses and bar tendresses.

Honestly though, it's worth a try, at least, simply because they brew thier own beer in house and it's actually quite good (especially the amber). I definitely recommend this to anyone!"}
{"text":"Came here twice while in Montreal and think it is a solid choice.   First time, just had beer because the kitchen was closed.  I had the amber and it was fine.  Nothing too unique.

Second time came for dinner with a bunch of friends.  We ordered the meter of beer which came with a pizza and that was a great deal.  I had the French dip sandwich and I liked that a lot.  My friend enjoyed his salad.

Service the first time was okay but Laurie our waitress at dinner was outstanding.   This is definitely a reliable place to have decent beer and good food."}
{"text":"Great pub had a few really tasty beers before we went to dinner.  Pepe was an awesome barkeep, friendly staff good beer and fun place to imbibe some local brews."}
{"text":"Great local microbrewery. Good beer selection, with a few oddballs just to keep you on your toes. Good food, laid back attitude, good beer, good bet. They win points, too for presentation with things like a mini keg you can order right at the table, a mètre de bière (that comes with a complimentary snack), and lots more. What's not to like?"}
{"text":"We were visiting Montreal and checked this place out. My wife and son got burgers and they were very happy since the burgers were cooked the way they like them . Often, my wife deals with undercooked burgers at other establishments and has to send them back. I had the chicken bacon poutine, which is a Quebec dish of fries topped with pulled chicken white meat, bacon, cheese chunks and grazy. It was very good and it's too bad one cannot find this in Boston, at least that I know of. I had an IPA and my wife a Belgian wheat ale since the 3 brasseurs is a brewpub. Both beers were good though unexceptional or challenging. I am used to IPA's with more character though perhaps Canadian/Quebecois tastes are different and these beers fit the bill up north. The service was very good, best I have had in a long time, anywhere."}
{"text":"Went with a large group on Saturday night.  Although the restaurant was very busy the staff made sure we were happy and the food was great.  Will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Nice pub/bar along the main street. We were initially attacked to sit at the bar by the lovely Sabrina who pulled two terrific pints for us. The beer was excellent and fresh. The view at the bar was also excellent and fresh. I'd come back here again.

Nice seating area facing the street so that you can watch the people go by as you're enjoying your drink and/or meal."}
{"text":"Les 3 Brasseurs has been an amazing success story. They have expanded rapidly and branched out to several Canadian and French cities. No wonder - the combination of brewery, resto and sports bar just works! 

The food is good, and offers a twist on all time favourites. The Bruno burger is not just a cheese burger, but a burger on ciabatta bread with goat cheese and pesto - and tastes as great as it sounds. The salad with salmon is very good, too. 

Guests can help themselves to complimentary peanuts from a big barrel and munch till their food arrives, which usually does not take long. The place can get pretty crowded especially during a game, but service is fast and efficient. 

My only negative point is that the flam kuchen -though delicious and crispy - cool way to fast. They are cold before I can eat even half of them. Heated plates might help!"}
{"text":"How frustrating!! We stumbled on this fantastic place on Saturday night - food looked great - could have eaten all of it!! BUT the problem was lack or beer - the two best sellers had run out!! Still the Munich special was fab and the waiter assured us the IPA and the Amber would be back on the next day! We left it till the Monday - thanksgiving day - and tried again. Imagine our despair when we hear that 'due to a big holiday weekend' they had run out!!! (Although I knew they had been without their top beers since at least Saturday night! Come on guys need to get your planning right - can't imagine how much $ business you guys lost due to a gap in supply!!! Wish I could say we'll be back but I'm off to NYC next week and then home to New Zealand. Happy brewing!"}
{"text":"Loved the white beer and the food was amazing!!!!! Great service and awesome atmosphere!! Definitely going back before the end of my trip!"}
{"text":"We stopped here before our first real day of exploring Montreal on foot.  It was a great place for lunch!  The staff were very friendly to us (I'm sure obvious-looking tourists), and we had a good talk about the place and what it's like during the evening.  We ordered the Bacon Mac and Cheese and a burger and split it.  The burger was under-seasoned, but with the topping and Ketchup and Spicy mustard was good.  The M&C was VERY good.  Considering we were going to be walking for the majority of the day, we passed on the beer, but I loved the beer menu and several among the patrons had the beers.  The waiter said their Poutine was exceptional, and we said we'd consider that if we had time later in the day (unfortunately we didn't).  Again, several tables had it and it looked really good.  Definite recommendation from us.  Friendly staff, a very good looking menu, and craft beer.  How can you go wrong?"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a sports bar type of feel, this is the place to be!

Especially if there's some sports game on, it'll get loud and crowded so if that's not your cup of tea, maybe check another place out, plus this is a beer place so probably not that great of tea ;)

Liked the decor of the restaurant, very lively and entertaining.  They brew their own beers here, but sad to say, none of which I was a huge fan of.  They do have a popular white beer that has grapefruit in it which wasn't bad if you wanted to try one.  Their IPA is definitely more belgian than IPA, at least to me (I am an IPA girl now thanks to my b/f, sadly I used to love belgians). 

Food was all right, nothing spectacular or mind blowing. They did have this mac n cheese grilled cheese sandwich which was pretty crazy but definitely felt my arteries clogging just looking at it!
 
bottom line, if you're looking for a more romantic feel, definitely better place elsewhere but if you wanna just hang out with the guys or watch a game, come on over to Les 3 Brasseurs!"}
{"text":"While walking around Old Montreal looking at all the souvenir shops and tourist traps we stopped and looked at the menu of Les 3 Brasseurs. My wife liked what she saw and we continued walking around the area to check the other local eateries. After walking around the Old Port area my wife wanted to go back to that \"brewery place\" we checked out earlier.

After a short walk we found Les 3 Brasseurs and took a seat in the outside dining area. We were promptly greeted by our server Jerome. My wife ordered a beer and I ordered a flight of beers to sample what they brew. We looked at the extensive menu and I decided on the pork shank with mashed potatoes and veggies my wife had the chicken. While waiting for the food we sampled their beers. We both decided that their dark brown stout was the best of the brews we tried and when Jerome brought over our meals we both ordered a pint.

The pork shank was fall off the bone good was well seasoned and tasted great. The mash potatoes and veggies were also very good. During our visit we became friendly with the couple at the next table who were from Australia. We had to get up to let them get to their table so we just started talking once they sat down. They were good company. Across the aisle were a group of college kids with a giant dispenser of beer for their table to share (see photo below). 

My only complaint is that the tables were too close together so be prepared to make new friends. We liked Les 3 Brasseurs so much so that a couple a days later we found another Les 3 Brasseurs location closer to our hotel and had dinner there. You can read my review of that location elsewhere on Yelp."}
{"text":"Fun a atmosphere. Great staff. Good food and drink.
Nice range of micro beers and food selection."}
{"text":"This place is terrible.  Nothing is made to order burgers can only be well done that should have been a clue.  French fries were not hot and when sent back they were hotter but not fresh.  Fish and chips - not good - even the ice cream from the kids menu was frost bitten.  Lemon drop drink was watered down.  Service was extremely friendly and accommodating but with such bad food there's not much more to say"}
{"text":"I had the french pizza thing, and it was pretty good.  Other people's food looked nice as well.  Overall the place is alright, and the prices are fair for a glorified bar downtown.  You won't leave hungry as the portions are nice.  It's a neat place to check out and its a microbrew, but it didn't impress me much.  It's good for groups who want to have some beers and grab a bite."}
{"text":"Late stop by on a long Tuesday worknight for nachos and Habs vs Canucks, except uh oh, we've got a Vegas vs Tampa Bay game on. Ummm, what?? Ok maybe somebody dropped the ball and forgot to change the 5 big screens in this place to a hometown game. Nope. From the time I asked for them to switch the channel over to the local game (right when I got  seated) the Habs scored, tied the game, and the 1st period ended. Great. Thanks for switching it to the right game at the end of the first. So my nachos are nearly done at the start of the second period? Why didn't I watch the game in it's entirety in my hotel room and order Uber Eats again? Hmm, I'm calling this visit a failure (nachos are nothing to write home about). I don't hate the brand, they've come through on busy nights before at other locations so...not writing them off quite yet. Even their spot at Yonge Dundas in TO seems to have their act together during packed free-concert nights in the summer, so no excuses Old MTL - get your act together."}
{"text":"While this place was a saviour and a half on a hot day I sadly am giving it a 3/5 and here's why:

The beer. The beer should be the best part, it is after all Les 3 Brasseurs.... The three brewers. I don't love their beer. I was disappointed by the IPA. I expect an IPA to be the right mix of hoppy and malty and this was obviously tamed down... I expect because this is a chain and less about focusing on the beer themselves so to make it appeal to more they dumbed down the hops but it didn't do it for me. 

The atmosphere was good, we sat at the bar which is pretty funky, neat old lights with the brew tanks visible and felt very brew-pubby.

The service was okay. Okay at best. It was really busy and people were running around so it's understandable, but it wasn't memorable. 

The location really did save us the most. We'd been wandering Montreal all day with our packs before our train and so this was a great place to stop in as is nice and close to the train but to be honest, that's about it.

I expect more in Montreal really. There are so many amazing breweries and brasseries around the city I expected more."}
{"text":"Visited from New York and decided on this restaurant!  The poutine was quite good and served as a great appetizer.  I recommend getting the poutine with house fries.  The difference is definitely real!  If I ever make the trip back to Montreal, I will more than likely visit 3 Brasseurs again."}
{"text":"There are very few restaurants that make me sit back and think about how I should be kinder to chain restaurants when I write reviews. And Les 3 Brasseurs was one of the those lucky few. While there is not way to avoid chain restaurants all the time. I try to support local places. So bare with me as I explain to you why I love this place. 

I was in Montreal for the weekend, visiting friends from Uni. I was also there with a friend from Cincinnati, taking him on his first Canadian adventure. On our first night, we were on our own and up to our devices for getting dinner. We chose Les 3 Brasseurs mostly because they brewed their own beer. I mean as a beer lover, that is just heaven for me. We got placed at the bar because it was a crowded Friday night. The bartender was very attentive and very beautiful. She was more then happy to speak English. And she pretty much gave us a college level course on their beer selection. We went with two liters of the Amber. I mean we were planning on drinking, might as well go \"balls to the wall\". Along with our beer, we ordered their Poutine. And while I try not to explain food as orgasmic. A plate of their poutine maxi is just that, orgasmic. My friend had the open faced seafood sandwich. And I ordered the Quebec Flammekuchen. Covered in a local cheese,bacon and onion. It was so good. We became friends with a few of our fellow bar sitters. And with the assistant to the bartender, he wasn't a busboy and he was allowed to take orders, just not pour them. Weird? Anyway. We kept ordering beer and shots of Sortilege ( a wonderful maple bourbon that is just amazing). Before we knew it, it was 2am. And we were very well gone. So with a few of our new friends we met at Les 3, we moved to a cheaper drinking hole. And the rest of the night is kinda blurry after that. But I will always eat here when I am in Montreal. Hell, until I find a better place. This will be my favorite place to eat in Montreal! Bring on the flame war."}
{"text":"Food was delish , drinks good. But getting our food was to long. Place was clean. With great view."}
{"text":"The service and food were not great. After asking for water 3 times (and asking the bartender who said they would bring it to my table) and receiving our food one hour after ordering (already cold and returned back to the kitchen) we decided to give up hope.

The only redeeming quality for this restaurant is their home brewed beer which I drank so much of I almost forgot how long our food took..."}
{"text":"We went company event here.  Fixed menu and drink coupons so not a perfect experience.  The servers were not very good.  They seemed unhappy and it felt weird.   The food was mediocre.  The chicken salad was hard to eat.  The burger was olk.  The pizza was good.  I think the staff made it hard."}
{"text":"There was not much for a vegetarian to eat.  I ordered a garden salad and some garlic bread.  They were both good.  The dressing on the salad was really, really good.  I ordered a beer cocktail (\"tango\") which I enjoyed more than I thought I would, and then had a blonde beer which was excellent as well.  My companions had sauerkraut plates with sausages, ham and pork.  The report was that the first two items where \"un-spectacular\" but the pork was tender and \"interesting\".  They also had an order of poutine which they enjoyed but was not as good as in other places.  After the initial uninterested and semi-rude people at the door our waiter seemed friendly enough.  We were served pretty fast, specially considering that they were insanely busy.  Would go back for more beer!"}
{"text":"Arrived in Montreal today and live visiting here.... Stopped in here as their 'pizzas' looked good. They are pizza like, just on a flatbread. 
The staff were friendly but we were unable to sit at a booth as they are for four people which annoyed me a little but guess I can understand they don't want to turn others away. This meant I had to sit at what I would refer to as bar stools and a tiny round table up high. Not a fan of eating like this - no problem if just having a drink! We did end up moving to a smaller booth when one was available. 
The food was really nice and we enjoyed the pizza and fries. The food was predictable and tasty. 
The service was a little ordinary tonight and we felt a bit under serviced. It took a long time until we could order then once we received our meals no one came near us until we asked for the bill. Not really impressed and would probably not come here again."}
{"text":"Decent place. 

Good service

Mediocre atmosphere if you get stuck in the back room. 

Beers were ok, nothing special. 

Had the Salt, Beer, Salt, Cheese, Salt and Salt breadbowl. It was...um....salty. Ugh."}
{"text":"Nous sommes allé dans ce resto car il faisait faim et qu'on n'avait pas envie de se prendre la tête, mais franchement on n'a pas été emballé. La bouffe était vraiment passable. Le burger sans sauce, le sandwich au porc effiloché sec et sans végétaux, alors qu'ils figuraient sur la carte et vraiment pas très bon. Le service était sympa, mais nous avons dû réclamer des couverts, puis le chou qui avait été oublié, puis encore le chou car la serveuse avait oublié... Si non il y a de l'espace et on arrive à s'entendre parler mais je n'y retournerai pas."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere of combining a sports bar and restaurant. There are a lot of food and beer options. I had the smoked meat poutine and blonde craft beer. A great casual restaurant that's perfect to catch a game, get a beer, and have a good meal."}
{"text":"This place was wonderful. The waitress at the door was a little annoying though. She placed our group of 10-15 people right by the door near the bar and then kept complaining we were getting in her & the customers way. Uhm.. sure lady.. You put us here... 

But anyway, the atmosphere was really nice. The place is spacious, 2 floors. The upstairs has all this brewing equipment showcased behind glass. It's pretty cool. They also have a huge barrel of free peanuts at the entrance. That's another thing she got annoyed at too! We kept taking peanuts and throwing the shells on the floor.. Yes, I know that is not good manners, but that is what the other patrons of the bar were doing! They don't give you any place to put them. There were tons of shells already on the floor. We assumed it was just custom to do that.

But anyways, this a great place to come with your friends, have some drinks, and enjoy each others company. Just.... don't sit by the door.. lol"}
{"text":"Liked their pork shank, the fish and chip are not so good, the salad and fries are also just so so"}
