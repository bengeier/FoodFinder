{"text":"Went there Saturday night - there were 4 of us, 2 couples.

Horrendous service!

1. Started with - Waiter refused to do separate cheques, suggested we calculate it ourselves at the end. Wanted to avoid this but we were not accommodated.

2. We did not get our main courses until over 2 hours after we sat down!!! Whenever we asked where the food was we were told \" it's being plated\". Two tables that had arrived after us were eating their food. They had obviously made some mistake but instead of owning up to it they kept lying.

3. After the meal, my husband who us in the hospitality business, asked the waiter nicely if they'd do anything for us for the inconvenience. We got one piece of tiramisu for the 4 of us to share, but our coffees were not comped nor any other part of the meal.
Instead the owner appeared at our table and proceeded to argue with us that it was our fault as we'd taken 30 minutes to order!!!!
We didn't argue back we just wanted him to
leave., he was so rude.

The food was very good ( although bread was cold and stale) - but we can go to many other restaurants in Toronto where we can get good food and great service. Try Paesanos in North York- same menu - excellent service.

This was just ridiculous, an example of the lowest of customer service.

Do not ever eat here!!"}
{"text":"Have been to this place many times.

Took an out of town guest there a couple of months back and she loved it.

However, last time I went (shortly after I went with the out of town guest), I was disappointed. Poor service and food was not as good as usual. 

Will wait awhile before I try again I think."}
{"text":"This place is cute inside, inviting, and always busy. It seems to be a favourite in our area. In my opinion the food is just average, however. There are better Italian restaurants in the neighbourhood on the other side of Yonge Street, like Trio or Piazzetta."}
{"text":"Love this place. Have been there many many times, love their Casserole Di Mare (seafood casserole), it is delicious. I get it every time I have a company to share it with - it is a dish for 2 people. The service is very friendly, and despite dated decor and crowdedness it feels like little Italy. If you are there in summer try outside terrasse in the garden, it is really nice and romantic."}
{"text":"Extremely POOR service!!  Waiter REFUSED to do seperate bills for customers !!  (It's not like it's a high-end restaurant in the financial district)
4 of us went there for dinner on Monday.  There were only 2 other tables of customers. Obviously NOT BUSY.   
we politely asked for seperate bills. Waiter responded \"I'll just give you one bill. As I noticed 4 of u are friends, right? You can divide by yourself ! \"  Despite the fact that our frd mentioned, \"But I ordered one more plate than others so my bill will be more expensive\"    Each of us end up had to calculate everything & even type our own amount into the machine, tear off invoice paper, re-type amount due to wrong input...etc.  The whole time while we PAY using the machine,  the waiter just vanished !! 
Very poor customer service.  NEVER GO BACK. 
Food....no taste at all. We all had to add salt."}
{"text":"After 10 years we decided to revisit this family run Italian restaurant. The food was delicious. The service was great. Good job"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Gamberoni. I went for a lighter dinner since I wasn't too hungry, and ordered escargot and linguini pescatore. The escargot was a surprisingly nice start, with red wine tomato sauce; the taste was adjusted well.. enjoyed it very much. The only drawback was that the escargots melded in with the mushrooms a bit. As for the linguini, it was a wonderful, perfectly-portioned dish with rich, diverse flavors. It went very nicely with the white wine sauce, and had an ample amount of seafood. Lastly came the tiramisu as dessert; as I was already quite full by then, the mascarpone was a little bit heavy, but otherwise it would have been great! The chocolate syrup at the top was also a bit on the sweeter side for my tastes, but I loved the brandy-dipped base. This is a must for those who love richer desserts, and they truly put in good quality ingredients."}
{"text":"Came here for a work-related dinner with 4 colleagues. Restaurant had an intimate vibe and old school feel. We all enjoyed the basic bread basket. It came with cold chunks of salted butter, which I personally prefer over butter that's room temp. I had the linguini gamberoni with the shrimp and scallops shown in the bottom left of the pic. It was a decent meal. We had no issues with the service. Only weird thing was the ads and statements that surfaced in random spots on the bathroom mirror."}
{"text":"We arrived on Friday evening at 7pm. My experience with Gamberoni was very negative. We started on a positive note - warm ambiance and decent wine. 

After ordering, we had to wait 40 minutes for our meals. I understand businesses can be busy at times, so it's not an issue. However, both meals were a complete disappointment: 

Linguini Gamberoni 22.95 - a seafood pasta. We counted 2 shrimps. 
Lamb chops:  Three overcooked, bite-sized lamb chops for $36. 

We escalated to the owner (older man). He spoke to us in a condescending, threatening manner. 

This was the worst experience I've ever had - and in my own neighborhood. I do not recommend Gamberoni.  

Service: 0/5
Food quality: 0/5 
Ambience: 2/5"}
{"text":"This is one of the many restaurants in the Yonge and Lawrence Uptown area. We came in on a Thursday night around 5:30pm and there was only one other couple in the restaurant with us at that time. 

As others have stated, the decor is dated and the place is run by older surly looking waiters. We did not get any attitude that night as others had experienced. The service was okay. I wouldn't say that it was attentive but we weren't ignored and they complied with our requests to top up

We ordered two linguine (one shrimp and scallops and the other one with salmon) and a veal parmigiana. The veal was the best dish. The problem with the linguine was that it was oily even though it was a large portion and they didn't skimp on the shrimp, scallops and salmon. All you could taste was the oil/sauce it was doused on and it wasn't very good. The veal was tender and breaded right and the spaghetti sauce was way better than the linguine sauce. They do bring you bread before your meal as they take their time bringing up the main dishes. 

Prices are a bit high which is in line with the area but unfortunately the quality of food is not up to par. 

I would rate it at 2 1/2* which was bumped for the service we got that night. 

I don't think I would come back as there are other restaurants in the vicinity."}
{"text":"Was just in Toronto visiting friends and they took us here for dinner.  The food was excellent, but a bit pricey. The portions were a nice size & everything was very flavorful and tasty. I would definitely return here on our next visit to Toronto."}
{"text":"The d√©cor is quite outdated, but I figured that was part of the charm. The waiters are all surly men...again part of that old European charm right?

Took their sweet time to come and take our order, very few properly Italian food...unless you only like pasta. 

I had the chicken marsala and the tiramisu, my boyfriend chose I believe something pork. 

It took close to 40 minutes for food to come. No explanation, no apology. 

But finally I thought, food...this should all be worth it. 

Nope, some of the blandest, greyest mush I have ever had the misfortune of eating. It wasn't disgusting, it was just offensively bland. 

But I had Tiramisu coming, that should be good. 

No, watery coffee sponge is more like it. 

Total price for 2 plates, 2 desserts and coffee?

96 dollars. 

For food I would be ashamed to serve at home. 

Never again."}
{"text":"Very friendly waiter.  I loved the seafood. Good place to go on a date!"}
{"text":"Not a super picky diner, so when I say there is no reason to eat here... Consider this: 

- 2 orders of the calamari special - all full of tiny, scrappy pieces.  Poor presentation 
- wine by glass - bottle must have been opened a long time ago...( and I'm not even a wino!!!). Just stale 
- waiter could not differentiate between a special and the similar dish on menu 
-3 waiters rotated, no sense of good service
- chicken limone dish -- looks like half a breast cut in half... Super thin, sparse plate 
- on plus side: great scallops 

Food portions small for what you pay for. Nothing really redeemable. I see the high reviews -- wondering why... Pass"}
{"text":"Lovely neighbourhood Italian restaurant. Decor is a bit dated but the food is spendlid.

The outside has this new look."}
{"text":"Never again.  This used to be a favourite but not anymore.  The service was terrible, and I mean terrible.  Yes it was busy, but give me a break, only water when we sat down and after half an hour, a basket of bread came.  Didn't get to order appetizers and drinks until the 45 mins later.  Of course at that point we ordered our meals as well,  The appetizer came after being there 1 1/2 hours and the meals came after 2 hours!!!  In between, bread was our sustenance.  I don't care if there was a party upstairs, we deserved service and did not get it.  The food which we expected to make up for the overly long delay, unfortunately did not.  It was not good AT ALL.  If I could give a zero I would.  We added salt, hot peppers, cheese, anything to make it good, but even that didn't work.  Although I am Italian and know how it should taste, I am not a snob and do appreciate good simple food.  Save your money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Serving up some of the best bruschetta in the city, Gamberoni is a low-risk option for good Italian. Not the finest dining, but quality food at fair prices. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"great, traditional italian food. you really get the home cooked dinner feel at this place"}
{"text":"If you are looking for true Italian faire, you must visit Gamberoni's, you will not be disappointed...  Upon entering thie establishment we were met and greeted by Mamu, who was extremely professional and attentive to our needs.  My table and up ordering the bruschetta, which is absolutely the best I've ever had!!!! I ordered the lasagna, which was placed in a bed of tomato/cream sauce which was phenomenal.  I have no complaints only compliments for Gamberoni's.  I will return again, when I am in town and Pass this gem of a restaurant of to my colleagues who come to Toronto."}
{"text":"First, let me ask who charges $8 for a bottle of San Pellegrino sparkling water? Perhaps the kind of restaurant looking to recoup the cost of having to prepare a second meal for us because our original dish was so intolerable? I don't know if this was their sly attempt to get back at us for not pretending our food was almost edible or if this is a regular scam they like to pull, but either way I'm grateful we made it out of there without food poisoning even if we left with suspiciously light pockets."}
{"text":"While the service was very traditional and excellent, I was not entirely impressed with the menu bar the gnocchi.  It was to DIE for!"}
{"text":"Tonight my boyfriend and I decided to go to Gamberoni for dinner. Having  just returned from a beautiful two week holiday to Italy  over the Christmas break
we were used to the amazing service we got in any restaurant we went to in Italy. Tonight at Gamberoni we  were seated at a table squished in the corner that we were not happy with. The restaurant was half empty  and we asked to have a bigger table where upon  we were given much attitude.
Finally the incredibly  arrogant and nasty owner, (one of the brothers) agreed to let  us sit at a table for four.
Eventually a waiter came over and my boyfriend had questions about the spaghetti with the seafood in it.
The waiter obviously had no idea how to do his job and in the middle of my boyfriend asking him what kind of seafood was in the pasta he abruptly turned and walked very quickly to the other side of the restaurant.
He did not return  and we weren't sure if he took our order or not.
About 25 minutes after that happened one of the very nasty owners came over to us to retake our order. He told us that the original waiter did not take our order.
When we asked him why the waiter took off his response was 'he's stupid what do you want me to do fire him'?
Instead of being apologetic he was Arrogant, condescending and just plain rude..
I have never experienced such unprofessionalism
in any restaurant I've ever been to..
We've also been longtime customers here so they know us and not one ounce of remorse..  There  
are way too many good Italian restaurants in Toronto for us to have to go back and take that kind of abuse and disrespect From a couple of miserable brothers who should know how to act in the service industry.
Arrivederci Gamberoni you now officially suck and you lost two great customers..."}
{"text":"Gamberoni is a hidden gem.  I have dined at the restaurant countless times and I have left satisfied and looking forward to coming back again.  My favourite meal is the veal cannelloni--it is absolutely brilliant--they also make excellent tiramisu. Based on my interaction with some of the waiters, they make the pasta dough themselves! Majority of the Italian restaurants I have checked out the food has tasted as though it was already pre-made frozen and they simply reheated it.

It may take some time for the meal to be  ready, however, it is definitely worth it.  I recommend you make a reservation because otherwise you will left to wait in line (especially on Fridays & Saturdays). A few minor negative observations (1) given how busy it gets sometimes the waiters are too preoccupied to attend to you [which is again explainable by the fact the place is completely packed] (2) I was not a major fan of the bread basket--it tasted a bit stale. I do not believe they have gluten free options but you should double check if that is important to you. The general crowd is older 40+ and I believe many of them have been dining there for many years (based on a few friendly conversations I have had).  Its wonderful place with lots of character and I think that if you are thinking of a place to have a date its a great contender."}
