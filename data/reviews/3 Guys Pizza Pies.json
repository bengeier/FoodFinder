{"text":"Good pizza, even if just a little pricey. Definitely a good change to have something different in the Brimfield area. We just got traditional pepperoni pizzas, order was ready when they said it would be. Didn't try the deep dish style. Hopefully they'll last longer than the last 3 places that were in this location...they did update the inside, so hopefully they plan on sticking around too. They don't use a whole lot of sauce, so that could be good or bad depending on your preference. Awesome pepperoni, too."}
{"text":"Good pizza.  Over cooked pasta.  A little overpriced.    Be careful though.  Instead of a small, medium and large...   They have a medium, large and extra large.   So when you THINK you are getting a large (at about everyone in the area's price for a large...   What ends up at your door is a smaller medium.   Tricky tricky way to charge more for less in my opinion.    Pizza is good though if you don't mind paying more."}
{"text":"Very tasty ! I love the meat lover's pizza.  Have had a few different pies from here and they are hearty."}
