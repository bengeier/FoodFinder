{"text":"I bought two chicken fillets delivery for my friend and I and it was a waste of my $40. The garlic bread is a hot dog bun with butter and my potatoes were not cooked, only good thing was the salad. The food came in a large portion but i did not enjoy the food so my friend and I did not finish. Lastly the delivery man was rude and blamed me for their debit machine not working. Not ordering from this place again."}
{"text":"This restaurant in a shopping centre in Scarborough.  Off the beaten path for me but I hope to find myself there again soon.  On a Saturday night the spacious room was dimly lit and quiet with few customers.  Just right for sitting in a corner with a friend and having a quiet conversation without the unbearable noise level that happens so often where there is good food and alcohol.  Though I did wonder later why a restaurant with such great food for the price wasn't busier.  Now, the best part: the food:  For starters, we had calamari, very nice and the yogurt sauce was great.  We both ordered the roast lamb plate (under $20).  A generous Greek salad arrived first, then the lamb - a big plate of it, tender and delicious.  The veg seemed fresh and perfectly cooked.  They may have been frozen, I am not sure, but they were good.  Then the potatoes, very nice.  Although we couldn't stop eating because it was all so good, there was still enough food for a Styrofoam box to be taken home and enjoyed the next day.  The house wine, Apelia, we tried in both red and white.  I don't drink much but that wine was very nice with the lamb so I had a second glass of the white.  Service was by a lovely man who was very friendly, knowledgeable, and accommodating.  http://tasteofgreekcuisine.com  The website doesn't seem to have a dinner menu on it, but apparently they even serve breakfast there.  I sure wish this place was closer to downtown where I live!  I loved the food and the prices.  It's the kind of restaurant where I want to try everything on the menu.  Jenny"}
{"text":"Order from them weekly and honestly, the service has declined tremendously.  Ordered chicken souvlaki on a pita and a salad.. paid 13$ and received no sauce on ANYTHING.  I decided to call back and let them know and instead of apologizing and noting the mistake, I was in a heated discussion with the owner.  Never ordering from them again.   Photo added for proof, since I'm lying"}
{"text":"The service was a bit skewed as we entered and waited with no server attending to us, finally we went inside to the counter and where greeted with nice people. So possibly they don't have someone at the front so you have to walk into the back to be seated. Anyway this was our first visit we wanted to try a little of everything from them so we took the combo platter which has 2 skewers of beef, chicken, and lamb with potatoes in a sauce, and rice in the same sauce. It came with garlic bread but more like a toasted bun. Anyway, we didn't enjoy the food. The beef was very fatty and thus chewy, as was the lamb. Too many complaints to list with the food. Anyway, decor was something like on the Danforth but strangely enough found in Scarborough. The place is very spacious with outdoor seating available. You can sit in the back area where it is dimlit or in the sunlight area in the front of the windows. Decor was much better than expected. Prices are a bit on the high side for what they are offering - your better off sticking to the Danforh for that reason."}
{"text":"We have ordered from here several times, mostly the large family platters. Sizing is quite large and a good quantity of everything. They package everything for you really well and overall delicious.  Sometimes the pork is a bit dry but overall a good place with decent prices"}
{"text":"We ordered here the other night and the food was either horrible, or so under par I would never order here again. Gyro dinner, lots of food, executed poorly. Meat was so salty I couldn't finish, it literally tasted of salt and nothing else. Potatoes were big, but bland and tasteless, probably could of used some of the salt from the gyro... Greek salad, pathetic. Both of our salads had a 1 olive each, really! Why even bother. Just iceberg with a sprinkle of feta and an overripe tomato, dressing tasted of vinegar, the ratio of oil to vinegar was waaaay off. tzatziki had one single flavour dill....it could have been pure dill sauce for all i know.   I would never recommend this place, nor would I suggest you go here, it was just awful."}
{"text":"I have ordered take out from this place at least once a month for about a year and I've never been disappointed. The turnaround is fast the food is fresh and portions are awesome."}
{"text":"Food not bad nothing special. Awful service, awful customer service. I ordered the platter for 3-5 people for delivery and asked if it was possible to substitute the pork sticks for chicken Souvlaki. I believe the owner's name is Kosta, he said no problem and rushed me off the phone as if I was inconveniencing him. The food arrives, chicken is burnt, garlic bread is burnt, and he charged me an extra $6 for the switch without telling me over the phone. The delivery guy called him because I didn't know why they were charging me an extra $6, and his response was 'its extra you have to pay it' and hung up. Honestly the food is just ok regular greek food but just for the bad service and cheap attitude of the owner. Will never go back. I don't ever rate on Yelp but this was such bad service that I had to sign up just to post this."}
{"text":"This is a really great place.  Best Greek salad town.  Always great food and nice guys.  Should have a higher rating."}
{"text":"Ordered from here a few times and they are pretty good. Sometimes the pork is a bit dry and occasionally they send rice when I ask for none. Otherwise great food"}
{"text":"This used to be our favorite local Greek place back when it was The Friendly Greek.  Since they changed over to Taste of Greek Cuisine, they have gone slowly downhill.  The food is still pretty good, but the service gives new meaning to slow and the prices have been raised a lot.  The souvlaki and gyros dinners we used to get were $19.95 now which is way higher than competing restaurants, so we will likely not go back again.    Today we went for lunch (no lunch specials here though, only regular menu) and ordered two sandwiches, souvlaki on pita and gyros on pita, and it took 35 minutes to get our food despite being the only people in the entire restaurant.   The cost for this was $20 + tip!  We were in the restaurant for almost an hour and no other customers came in during that time, so I wonder how they can stay in business.  The only staff working were the owner (who was waiting tables) and two other guys in the kitchen.  No customers, jacked up prices, and too few staff creating slow service just screams to me that they are slowly going under."}
{"text":"Came for Greek salads and LOVED THEM. The \"Village Salad\" on the menu was especially good. Order a Saganaki and eat it with the salads - delicious.   The veggies were fresh and feta was creamy with good flavor and not too salty. The food came quickly and the service was friendly and attentive.   Tables had enough room and the chairs were comfy.   It was exactly what I wanted! Happy all around."}
{"text":"I was working in the area and went a few times, it was average. The last time I went, I was waiting in the front for what felt like forever,  the owner was in the back. I just ended up walking out and going to wimpys, not waiting forever, your food isn't that good. The giy looks like a woman."}
{"text":"It was okay flavour-wise, but the vegetables were clearly from frozen and nothing was fresh. Quality was poor overall. Wouldn't order again."}
{"text":"I was actually very pleased with my experience here!  The only reason I'm not giving a full 5 stars is that when we walked in, the place kind of smelled like cigarette smoke.  You know the kind of smell that sticks to sofas?  It was like that and a bit off putting when you walk in.  Other than that, the food and service was fantastic!  My friend and I came from the Scarborough Bluffs and looked for something to eat in the area,  I went to Yelp to look for near by Greek places.  I was really craving Greek potatoes lol. The place is located in a really run down looking plaza, but as I've mentioned in a previous review, these kinds of places are the best.  We were the only ones there so service was great.  The two people working there were so friendly and accommodating.  They would bring us new waters as soon as they saw us running low.  We didn't even have to ask.  My friend and I both ordered the regular chicken souvlaki dinner with roast potatoes and rice.  You had a choice between roast potatoes or lemon potatoes.  SO glad I got the roast potatoes as these are cooked in the tomato sauce.  SO good!  They also put some of this sauce on the rice.  Everything was perfect.  The potatoes, rice, chicken and tzatziki!  The chicken was so tender and juicy.  You also get a salad and some garlic bread with this meal.  They bring both out prior to the main meal.  So you get a full size salad (see pic).  The garlic bread just looked like a hamburger bun cut up, but I can't even hate, because it was delicious.  They use actual garlic pieces on the bread.  You get A LOT of food and the price is pretty good compared to other places where they just give you a little side salad and no bread for way more $$$.  I'd definitely return if I was in the area and for those who live in Scarborough or planning to go to the Bluffs, you must try this place!"}
{"text":"Great portions, tasty and authentic cuisine. Owner is very polite, attentive and accommodating. In house service is excellent! You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I do NOT recommend. Slowest service EVER. We ordered Greek style bruschetta as an app, a chicken souvlaki on a pit and a gyro on a pita with a side salad.   The bruschetta took almost 45 to come out, followed by the most sad looking side salad I've ever seen. I will say the bruschetta was delicious. The salad on the other hand consisted of pure iceberg lettuce, 1 olive, 1 slice of tomato cut in half with a generous sprinkling of feta and salad dressing, which cost an additional $5. Biggest rip off of life!   Our mains were alright. My boyfriend loved the gyro on a pita, the chicken was just average for me, but I honestly couldn't even enjoy the meal after waiting for so long to get our food which looked like we could've gotten in less than half the time from a Greek stand in a food court.  We're all for supporting our local businesses but if you're going to open a restaurant, at least know how to efficiently run one. How this place has still managed to stay open is beyond me.  Now that I'm finished eating as I sit here and write this review, I wonder how long I'll have to wait before I get the the bill to leave... (Should've asked for the bill when we placed our initial order)"}
{"text":"Probably the best Greek food in Scarborough. I would definitely recommend this place over some of the restaurants on Danforth. Feels like a mom and pop shop and you can tell they love what they do. Large portions and for $7.95 the gyro pita had more that $8 of meat."}
{"text":"Really a nice surprise. Dropped in for chicken pita and salad.  I thought it was delicious... chicken tender, salad fresh and tasty and really nice people. Will order in another day. Great little spot tucked away."}
{"text":"Always hot when delivered, generous portions, always order the meat platter and haven't strayed from that."}
