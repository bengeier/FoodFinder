{"text":"Stopped in on our trip between Indy and South Bend in the afternoon for lunch - what a great choice we made! Fried pollock with fried cabbage and cheesy potatoes for a great price and wonderful flavor; chicken tenders for the little guy and he loved the broccoli. Other half ready enjoyed the broasted chicken (\"amazeballs, so juicy!\"), reported average mac 'n cheese but solid mashed potatoes and gravy.   Freshly brewed sweet tea was great and while we were too stuffed to enjoy dessert, they looked delicious. Had great service, too. We'll definitely be returning on future trips - likely getting an app, one dinner, and dessert!"}
{"text":"went for breakfast. arrived had was not greeted. order was misplaced and it too way too long to get my pancakes and dad's french toast.  pancakes arrived very heavy and doughy.  dad ordered 2 slices and got 3.  after asking a couple waitresses where the order was, a manager came out bad then did check with us about our food.  but didn't offer even a free coffee for the huge delay.  I was not impressed and don't really have the desire to go back. giving the 2 because the atmosphere is nice!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your money on this FROZEN FOOD! I thought this was still the Log House restaurant.  So I was coming for Log House home cooking. I didn't realize that this restaurant was bought by new owners.  I  loved the Country Fried Steak that log house made as a special from scratch. It was the best.  So I stopped in to check the specials a behold  there it was on the board.  I told the server I already know what I want.  When I got the it I could see it didn't look the same.  It was a purposely misshaped disk...  You know the frozen hamburgers that some idiot thought if they don't make it perfectly round then sucker customers might think it was homemade.  Same with this.  I tasted it and could tell it was frozen.  I only tried to get the server attention about 9 times and she just focused elsewhere.  Finally she noticed me 10 minutes later.  I said I can tell this is frozen from a box to the fryer.  She said,  \"yeah.\" I said I always came here for this dish and it was the best anywere!  Are there new owners or a change of cooks.  She said the restaurant was bought by new owners.  I  told her I don't come to a restaurant to eat frozen food.  I  could buy that frozen in a store for $2.99.  I  wouldn't because I can make it homemade. how hard is it to pound out roundsteak dredge in seasoned flour and egg and fry it?  Not very, especially for a restaurant.  It really bothers me when a restaurants put out sh*t instead of making the best food they can.  LAZINESS and lack of committed to quality.  And more so a lack of respect for their diners to give them frozen crap and expect them not to notice.  I left.  Turns out the old log cabin owners moved there business from the highway just into downtown Argos.  Heading there now!  Just say no to Fiddlers Moon's frozen food. And they need to take the Log House sign off the building!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite restaurants in the Plymouth area. We live out of town town and always go to fiddlers moon whenever we are in town to visit family. The atmosphere is cozy and quaint and the food is outstanding!  Prices are reasonable and staff is always helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"I've been eating here at least twice a month since they opened in November 2014 and keep coming back. Here's a few facts before I review the food. First, there are daily specials that aren't on the menu so don't expect to order the same thing every visit.  I've tried just about everything on the menu here are my favorites and some that I'd pass on: You can't go wrong with the perfectly grilled pork chops that melt in your mouth. This meal will feed two light eaters. The tenderloin sandwich topped with shredded slaw is first class and very filling but not so huge that you'll be eating it for days. If you've never had slaw on your pork fritter before you're missing out. The brisket sandwich, unlike any I've ever had, is the best sandwich on the menu. The broasted chicken takes extra time to cook but is well worth the wait, best in the county. If you're lucky enough to stop when pulled pork is a special you're in for a treat. Sometimes it's even part of a pork chop combo, again enough for two to share. The locals all say the spaghetti and meet balls can't be beat and I agree 100%. You'll get a large portion that you may find yourself taking home. Other items you can't go wrong with: pollock, catfish, timber burger, wraps, and soup bowls.  Sides If you like sauerkraut you'll love the fried cabbage as a side. I also recommend the mac n cheese, cheesy potatoes, and signature potato salad.  Dessert Don't leave without eating or getting one of Kent's Cupcakes to go.  Breakfast The Moosecakes \"pancakes\" are thick and filling. They tasted like they were made with wheat flour and that's fine by me. The waffle tasted much like the moosecakes but the fried cinnamon apples brought it to a new level. The scrambled eggs were cooked just right as was the savory sausage patty. Oh, and don't forget the maple syrup.  I love the atmosphere of the dinning room, music, and restroom decor."}
{"text":"So far, we've been here three times for breakfast. My sweetie absolutely loves it and I like it. The quaint decor lends an extra, pioneer feel to the place, as though stopping by at a long-ago eatery on the Oregon Trail.   The service is exceptional. Friendly, chatty servers have waited on us each time, and they are quick to make suggestions. Servings are hearty and reasonably-priced.   Someday, we'll have to give dinner a whirl. Until then, I'm ranking this little gem four stars."}
{"text":"Great comfort food! Its got a taste of Cajun and the seafood is amazing! Definitely coming again!"}
{"text":"really good food, everything at the table was delicious. they've given the place a facelift and cleaned it up.  the walleye fillet was some of the best restaurant fish i've ever had."}
