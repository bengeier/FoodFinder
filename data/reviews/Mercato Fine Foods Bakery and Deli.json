{"text":"The pastries, deli and hot plate sections here are great. I loved the meatball sandwiche and canollis!  This place has a very fresh and vibrant italian bakery feel, not too old but not too modern. The rich aroma of excellent espresso fills the air, and mixes with a wonderfully noxious aroma of meat balls and san marzano tomato sauce. Driving by here while its open almost always constitutes for a meatball sandwich run with a Chinotto, Brio or Orangina. You really owe it to yourself to give this place a shot if you're craving some italiano food.  The pasta and sauce are cooked perfectly, and by the taste I can tell the food wasnt sitting around under a heat lamp for long. Quality is the focus here, and it shows in the food.  Give it a shot, highly recommended."}
{"text":"Dropped in a couple of more times and had the Meat Lasagna both times.  First time was good and the second time it was a bit crusty on top like it was sitting there for a while but it was still good.  The meat was kind of minced."}
{"text":"Shortly after graduating University I found myself a quaint little job in the tiny Peel Regional town of Bolton, Ontario. While the gig was a first and in the midst of recession, businesses was ok and my co-workers were some of the best I had every had the pleasure of working with.   One of our favorite hobbies was going doing our Italian due-diligence and taking turns doing coffee/espresso runs for each other. At the time my coffee tastes were unrefined and without a Starbucks or Second Cup near by we lapped up the swill poured by Tim Hortons 2 and 3 times a day. That being said, we eventually grew tired of timmies and searched out more refined and more heavily caffeinated options. Enter Mercato Espresso.  Located behind their expansive pastry counter, the ladies of Mercato, dressed in their aprons and little fold out caps are dolling out espresso by the bucket full. And with good reason, it's a clean finishing, strong, bold espresso that will put hair on chest, regardless whether you're a man or a woman.  Before I glaze over something very important I mentioned in the last paragraph I should note that if you are looking for an excellent canolli, I would highly recommend you try one here. Obviously there are the two standards (cream filled and whipped ricotta cheese filled) but anyone who is anyone knows the ONLY way to do is ricotta. Hoo Ahh!  Pastries and Espresso aside what kept our crew coming back day after day was their ever changing Hot table at lunch. Unlike many other places, Mercato's hot table is extremely high end, things are made fresh consistently. Pizza is generally \"OK\", but thouse who know hot tables, know you never do the reheat pizza on the line, its all about the pastas, meats and veggies. The Lasagna and Veal (when available) are  outstanding - must tries!  Once you've picked up your espresso, canolli, lasagna and veal, they offer a raised seating area perfect for noshing - because you know you aren't gonna take this to go and make it all the way home successfully.   Eatcrest OUT!"}
{"text":"Excellent Gelato! 1 scoop is $4.00, and worth every cent! Or try their Nutella Sfoglia cake"}
{"text":"I've been to every bakery in the GTA but none compare to Sam's place Mercato! Do yourself a favor and have a ricotta zeppole"}
{"text":"If you've read my reviews, as far as bakeries go, you know I'm searching for Portuguese custard tarts.  This place has a lot to offer, hot meals, salads, pastas, breads, espresso, cheeses, gelato and pastries.  The only thing I've got from here are some pastries.  Cannoli's, some other things I don't know the name of and the custard tarts.  These tarts for me are the gold standard right now.  The taste is near perfection.  Flaky tart, not too thin and the custard is just the right amount of sweet.  That being said the custard filling isn't gigantic like other tarts either but it's just about perfect for me.  Everything is made daily there and the employees seem really nice and want to help.  Anyway, since this is my gold standard, I should give 5 stars but I'm still in search of perfection.  Highly recommended and I will always come back.  Would love to give my 2 cents on everything else here but I really only come for those tarts."}
{"text":"\"Leave the gun. Take the cannoli.\" - Clemenza (The Godfather) I consider myself a cannoli connoisseur, after all I did pretty much grow up in Little Italy. I went to a high school that was predominately Italian where the joke was that the English speaking club would meet in the phone booth across the street. I was in high school the year \"The Godfather\" hit the big screen (that makes me plenty old!). On top of it, after swearing off having anything to do with Italian men, I ended up marrying one. So in the end, I know a thing or two about cannoli.   First, let's be clear here, there are basically two kinds of cannoli. There are the Sicilian cannoli, a ricotta based filling surrounded by those brown, crispy sweet tubes. The other cannoli, from the northern region of Italy, are puff pastry tubes filled with a custard like concoction. Both types are usually dusted off with powered sugar. Both are delicious. I have though, always been partial to more standard ricotta cannoli. Some bakeries offer up a pistachio ricotta filling which gives the filling a slight light greenish colour.   La Sem has always been one of the standard go to places for cannoli but I live out in the 'burbs so finding a decent cannoli is a challenge. I love offering them up to company with Espresso on a Sunday afternoon. I have been blessed to have a really great Italian bakery/store called Mercato open up in Bolton a couple of years back. They house a pretty decent pastry case of those typical Italian type of pastries, which to be honest, aren't really my pastry of choice but when it comes to cannoli, Mercato delivers big time.   The fillings are always fresh, creamy and not crusty at the end. The shells have never been soggy and are always intact (this is the tell tale sign of freshness). Soggy shells are big fat no no. The ricotta filling is sweet with little tiny chunks of chocolate stirred in and you can taste the hint of nutmeg as well. That gets a big thumbs up from me! The Pastry Chef there told me that he will often use honey to sweeten the ricotta. Every Friday morning I stop in and bring in a half dozen into my office for my staff to gobble with their morning coffee. The Pastry Chef has taken to filling mine right there on the spot for me as he knows how much I love them and how much I appreciate them being so fresh.   Cannoli at Mercato are offered in two sizes, another big plus for me. I often find the bigger ones a challenge to finish off especially if you are serving them for dessert after a big Italian food extravaganza. Cannoli prices for the small ones are $1.50 @ and $2.50 for the larger one but are worth every single penny. La Dolce Vita!"}
{"text":"This place has an espresso bar, hot table, dessert counter, and fine groceries.  I haven't had a meal here, only bought some pastries.  The selection is good but it's very expensive.  For example, the Portuguese egg tarts are amazingly good, but they're $2!"}
{"text":"Good products and nice hot table. The pastries and cakes are always fresh but its a bit more pricey then italian bakeries in Vaughan. I buy bread there often and have tried most of the hot table items and have never been dissapointed.  I avoid buying pastries there because it gets pricey...but the pastries seem to be a bit nicer then most italian bakeries."}
{"text":"Great little place... Sam ( owner) and his staff are just super friendly people. Makes you feel like home. From the moment you open the doors and step foot through their bakery... You can smell the fresh baked goodness throughout!!! Great selections on their hot table, just out of the oven baked breads... Yum! cakes and sweets are just sinful, just an all around great place."}
{"text":"This is your typical Italian bakery and hot table. If youve been to Molisana, or Nino D'aversa... Expect something similar.   Their bread is quite good. They have cold cuts, Pastries, Gelato, and a hot table. Place is always busy. ALWAYS."}
{"text":"Went to Mercado based on reviews, it was around 7pm on a Saturday. I, took the tour around, nice place. Was thinking about eating at the hot table with the family but everything looked like it had been sitting for hours and starting to congeal. Bought some zeppole, staff seemed uninspired, pastries were on the pricier side, good but not great. I would try again, but am weary to buy at end of day, quality and service clearly lack at that time and the experience differs from the other reviews."}
{"text":"Come here for freshly baked bread of all sorts, desserts, gelato and prepared foods. They also offer Italian snacks and cold cuts too. Not too big but yet not too small. They have a eating area too if you decide to have a meal here."}
