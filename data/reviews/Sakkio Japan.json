{"text":"I can't even imagine how much chicken this place goes through in a week.  Anyway, the chicken teriyaki is great. They marinate their chicken and have a tasty balanced sauce that goes on top. I think it's only like $6 for a plate which is plenty for one person.  Sometimes they're a little inconsistent with portions and cooked-ness. They cook the chicken in large amounts at a time, and when it's done they keep it on the grill so I think sometimes some of it gets overcooked.  I can't speak for the other things on the menu, but I probably wouldn't get anything except the teriyaki."}
{"text":"Great looking store... Good food serve by great people with good customer service. I love the newly renovated mall, so clean and bright.   I was looking for place to eat and found this guy sampling outside as you walk in to the food court, taste it and the rest is history.  Order fried rice ( mountains), with mix cabbages ( they call is mix veggies) and order chicken teriyaki with the double meat.   Good food and i know whats and who prep my food  Will return when i visit the mall."}
{"text":"I used to like this place for mall food, but they changed up the ingredients that they use. I always liked the beef teriyaki and they used to use a ribeye or something but now they use these thin round processed meat \"things\" that have the consistency of shoe leather. Sorry, but I won't be back until the menu is changed.   Egg roll was like eating a cardboard paper towel roll. Most likely came out of a box and zapped In a microwave and the kept warm under heat lamps for 8 hours. Come on guys, you used to be halfway decent."}
{"text":"Sushi is unremarkable, yet better than average.  My wife fell in love with cucumber/seaweed salad that she has been trying to replicate.   Lots of good stuff to eat.  Location in mall, not so good.  Would go back more frequently if it were a stand-alone."}
{"text":"This was actually my second time here. I stopped in for lunch yesterday and it was so good I came back!! Definitely recommend the chicken Teriyaki Bento box! A little bit of everything and perfect portion sizes! The food comes out fast and is hot and incredibly delicious!!"}
{"text":"Being a mall employee, I eat here far too much and they've got my usual order down by heart. The food is prepared in front of you, it's reasonably healthy, and the quality is pretty reliable. The Chicken Teriyaki is the most food for your money in the Great Lakes Mall food court, and it tastes great!  Use the sriracha!"}
{"text":"OK, I am almost more ashamed of this than tongue wrestling with a cougar in a very fancy restaurant : ) This shi* is like crack, you'll always go back. The chicken Teriyaki is only thing that I get. It is slightly sweet and salty with a hint of garlic. The you pour a boat load of siracha on it for good measure. I will sometime forgo the rice and get extra vegetables. I do this so as avoid the food coma and probable 1000 calories. But if you want sheer volume go for the rice, and help us be the most overweight state in the most overweight country, hell get extra sauce or noodles too. Were talking enough to feed 2 or 3 people if you do that. Double chicken for 1$ ha ha ha. I need precious. The Styrofoam box is going to break. So when at the mall this is what I get, I do not go to the cheese steak and french fry place, no bourbon chicken for me, 2lb pieces of pizza for like 4 bucks, no way, Cafe Mickydee's, with no value meal, forget about it, Sakkio yo yo yo! I also like the fact that the chef's cooking up all that rooster happen to habla espanol."}
{"text":"Chicken teriyaki. Yum. Only thing that sucks is finding parking around terminal tower. Otherwise, it's quick to get, tastes good and is relatively cheap."}
{"text":"Now here is a complete surprise, a food court Asian joint with really tasty vittles. The lines at Sakkio are extra long for a reason, their grilled chicken is extra fresh and made to order. The portions are big, the prices are small. You can't ask for a better fast food lunch."}
{"text":"An ok place to get a quick meal if you are really hungry and in a hurry. Beats out all of the other food court fast food by far. The chicken teriyaki with rice is great, but everything else is kind of gross, out of a cardboard box type food. Simply put, only go there if you are in the mood for a large, inexpensive portion of really good chicken teriyaki."}
{"text":"I went here today for lunch BIG mistake. I ordered chicken terriyaki and a medium lemonade with no ice. The cashier gave me my drink with ice and I promptly asked for it without ice. The cashier then mumbled something that sounded like I didn't say with out ice. So I gave him back the drink and he went to fill my drink order correctly. As I began to wait a few minutes for him to hand me my drink his coworkers began to tell me that my order was ready on the other side of their line. So I began to ask the cashier for my drink...still no drink from that point I begin to ask for my money to be refunded. As I received my money back I noticed that the cashier was making sushi for another customer. It would have been more appropraite if he had asked another coworker to finish with me versus leaving me standing there. I then asked who the manager was and was told it was the cashier. Its pretty sad when an establishment lacks as far as customer service and the manager is the biggest culprit."}
{"text":"I stopped in to Sakkio recently for lunch. Teriyaki chicken was the deal of the day - $5.99 for chicken and rice. When you add veggies, which I did, apparently, the price goes up to $6.49. It was still worth it, however. There was a long line as the cook prepared the chicken. It took approximately 10 minutes to receive the food, but it was hot, fresh, and tasty!  They cook the chicken right in front of you. I guess that is why a lot of people eat here. The other similar eateries in the Galleria cook the food in the back where you can't see it. At first, it doesn't look like chicken because it gets scooped up out of a bucket in a ball of mush, but once it's cooked, it resembles the dark chicken parts that you're used to. I would imagine that A) some people would never eat here to begin with, and B) if they saw the chicken scooped from the bucket and splattered on the grill like I did, some people would probably walk away. It looked more like scrambled brains at the beginning of the process, but I assure you, by the end of the cooking process, it really looked and tasted like chicken!  I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"My wife ate here the day before and having heard nothing short of rave reviews I had the check for myself...Well she was spot on. Service was prompt and courteous and we were perfectly accommodated with little ice in my cup and extra ice in her's. The shrimp tempura roll was fantastic and should not be passed up."}
{"text":"I was very excited to have a sushi restaurant close to my house.  I was disappointed in this restaurant.  The sushi was served at room temperature and the calamari appetizer was small and bland.  Atmosphere is nice but service is slow."}
{"text":"I don't care how awful it may seem to absolutely adore a food court \"restaurant.\"  I love Sakkio Japan and really miss it now that I'm no longer in Cleveland.  I always ordered the teriyaki chicken.  The chicken is tender and comes piled on a mountain of veggies and rice (I prefer the white rice).  Get the extra sauce!  Sakkio Japan can always provide a quick, inexpensive lunch that is completely worth anything it may do to your stomach later."}
