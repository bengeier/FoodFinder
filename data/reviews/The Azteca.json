{"text":"This place is very special. It is so good. Family owned and run. They are very friendly and make delicious food.   It is worth the trip from Champaign or any surrounding community. The burritos are great. So are the tacos (pastor Mexican style is amazing). I'm currently eating their special called a Moyete. It's pretty much a huarache with meat and Mexican potatoes on their HOMEMADE bread!    Just come here. It's so frigging good.   - El Maestro"}
{"text":"We drive from Nashville to Bloomington a lot and this is a great, quick stop to eat when we're almost home, but know there isnt any food in the house :)   Cheap, simple Mexican food. The people that run the place are very sweet and give speedy service. Easy access from the highway. Even though there is another Mexican place close by, we always stop at Azteca. Consistently good!  Also a coffee shop next door if you need a quick pick me up :)"}
{"text":"This friendly little place near my home is a storefront with 6 tables and 4 stools, seating a maximum of 31. The service is rapid and the food really tasty. I'm surprised I didn't think to do a review of it sooner.  My wife and I have eaten here quite often, but on our last visit, she had the Carne Asada, while I had the Huaraches (1 beef and 1 chicken) and an Al Pastore Taco. The Huaraches remind me something of the Chalupas at Taco Bell, but Oh! so much better. We also had the Guacamole with chips. The salsa is good, too.  In the past, we've enjoyed a variety of tostados, mini-burritos, etc., etc. As I said, it's just a storefront without much in the way of ambiance, but with good food and friendly service, what more do you need?"}
{"text":"This place has great authentic Mexican food.  If you come here expecting something like El Toro or Dos Reales, you won't find it.  There food is great.  The Pastov Taco is my new favorite, but I have never had anything there that I didn't enjoy.    The service can be slow, especially when it is crowded.  The restaurant it self has more of a fast food feel to it than a casual restaurant.  The food more than makes up for these flaws."}
{"text":"Um real Mexican food in mahomet what? These tacos are better than some I've had where I live in Chicago. The staff makes you feel welcome, it's family owned...by the way...definitely would not compare this place to taco bell"}
