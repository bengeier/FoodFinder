{"text":"Went for my birthday. Had about a 10-15 minute wait to be seated after waiting for about 8-10 minutes for someone to ask us how many in our party. It was only my wife and I. So then we were seated with 6 others. And the table across from us seated 8 at the same time. We all waited exactly 1 hour for our chefs to appear. Our chef forgot a couple things an had to run back twice. Their chef was a bit more outgoing and a bit more efficient. They actually started eating they're rice and vegetables about 2-3 minutes before us. Then the hostess told them they were going to give them 10% off each of their bills. We did not receive this courtesy. The service was below average at best. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"We stumbled onto this restaurant by accident.  We originally wanted to go to another restaurant nearby, but we saw that the restaurant had recently opened so we gave it a try.  We couldn't have been happier.  The environment was great, the people were friendly, and the food was out of this world.  Yes, you get a bit of a show when the food is being prepared, but it was as tasty as it was fun to watch.  The hibachi tables seat up to 8 people so it can be a great group dining experience, too.  Will definitely go back.  Nice to have them in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I go here all of the time! Just as good as Shinto's in Strongsville for a fraction of the price. If you go, as for \"Tom Cruise\". He's the best cook. I can't speak for the sushi, but the Hibachi is absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"Good service but the decor is a little drab...could use an update.  Food is average and a little pricey."}
{"text":"Everything came out perfectly and timely. I have been to a lot of hibachi places and this one is on the top of my list."}
{"text":"It's a hit or miss. Sometimes sushi is great, and sometimes not so good. Still better than the most in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I've been to many locations previously, unfortunately the service at this particular location was terrible! First off they made us, a party of 18, wait for an hour and a half after making reservations. Then there were coupons purchased from groupon that they didn't honor. They were following protocol as far as the coupons, it would have been nice if the manager clarified this when we called, instead the manager mislead us to think we could use the coupons. Once seated at the table it took another 30 minutes to take our orders."}
{"text":"We were in town visiting family, and we particularly like to go out for hibachi at least once each visit.  This time, we went to Hibachi Steak House, and I hope we never have to go back...

First of all, I want to preface the remainder of this review by saying that the only thing that saved them from one star is the food - we ordered a sushi roll (I can't remember which one now) as an appetizer as well as hibachi dinners, and it was all outstanding.

What was not outstanding and easily ruined the entire evening was the chef.  I wish I caught his name so I can call him out specifically; we were told that the other chef our family members had in the past was great.  He was abusive, rude, and unprofessional towards only the female guests at the table.  He seemed to think he was being very funny and witty, but we were taken aback by how immature, mean, and sloppy he was.

A probably not exhaustive list of things he did:

- Used his spatula to fling bits of onion at my partner and I.  I was hit in the face, but my partner managed to duck in time.  I'm just glad I wasn't hit in the eye.  This was before the tossing of the shrimp game, which I declined to participate in (normally I do).
- Made fun of one of the other women's voice and laugh. He would mock it and laugh at her.  During the catch-the-shrimp-in-your-mouth game, he asked her to open wide because he was going to toss shrimp at her, and when she did, he gasped and made fun of how large her mouth was.  My partner interpreted his mocking as sexual innuendo regarding the guest's ability to perform blowjobs, but I didn't.  Whether he's right or not, it was completely inappropriate.  She looked genuinely hurt through all of this.
- Almost hit one of the other women in the face with a serving tray.  He meant to scare her, and thoroughly succeeded.
- Continuously made references to the female guests' asses.  This would be immature enough, but managed to make it more so by always saying that the yum yum sauce was \"good for the bum bum.\"  Again, he only said this to the women at the table.
- All, if not most, of the extra food left over after serving was given to my partner's stepmother, again with references to it being good for her bum bum.
- He attempted a trick of catching a packed bowl of fried rice right side up in his hat, but botched it and it spilled all over the place.  Fine, mistakes happen, but then he served the rice right out of his dirty hat anyway.

All this time, to the men at the table, it was \"sir, how is your food?\" and \"sir, is it cooked to your taste?\"  He was always polite and professional towards the men.

Since he was specifically targeting the women at the table, I was literally on the edge of my seat, wondering what he would attempt to do to me next.  I go out to eat because I want to relax, enjoy good food, and enjoy the company I am with.  This experience was not relaxing or enjoyable at all, in spite of the great food.  If it had just been my partner and I, we would have gotten up and left or at least spoken to management (since we were guests of our family members, I didn't want to contribute to the awkward situation any further).  Our family members said after that if they return and get the same chef, they will ask to be moved so they don't have to suffer through him again.

But hey, at least the food was good."}
{"text":"I agree with some other posts.   The night I was in there, the floor was filthy and dishes were piled everywhere.  Terrible.  I have given it a 3 star, though, because the food was very, very good and the services was great.   Not sure if I can go back if they continue to not keep the joint tidy.  Bleck!"}
{"text":"Sushi selections are limited (rolls mostly), and the rice doesn't taste like it has any vinegar.

Seaweed salad was a bit pricey considering that it's just seaweed, no fish.

Overall an *okay* visit."}
{"text":"Love this place!! I went here with my boyfriend while we were visiting family. He ordered steak and I had the bourbon chicken. I was so impressed! I live in a big city (Philly) and everyone is obsessed with the bourbon chicken near my school's campus. But it was 1000 times better at this hibachi, so i'm going to be pretty sad when I go back home. The steak was good too but I'm not a big steak fan so I can't really judge. I also really liked the atmosphere in general. And the chef made it really comfortable to be sitting with people we've never met."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout. Food was good, no complaints. Service was outstanding. I know that may sound confusing for a takeout order, but let me explain. I have celiacs (no gluten). So not only did the staff make sure that my meal was cooked separately to minimize any possible contamination, they also went ahead and labeled anything that may contain gluten on the actual takeout container. Even down to the little containers of yum yum sauce (which unfortunately contain gluten so I couldn't eat it). I really appreciated the thought and the effort."}
{"text":"3 stars is for the service. Idk if their chefs are on vacation but the new chefs are not good at all. Their food is horrible. I am a regular customer and but until the other chefs come back I won't be back anytime soon. If only I knew their names to call and check if they are back."}
{"text":"The teriyaki salmon was ok but overrated by other yelpers.  The cooking surface edges need to be deep cleaned.  Service was good.  The cook was about average.  The filet of beef was cooked just right."}
{"text":"Waited 50 minutes after our reservation time of 7:20 to be seated. Waited another 15 for the waitress to take drink orders, and as the children next to me are stating \"we have been waiting for 7 hours!\".   Long wait times(don't come if you're cranky) decent food..."}
{"text":"Abolutely disgusting!!!!

I wish this 0 stars was an option..because that's what it deserves.  Absolutely disgusting!! I would absolutely recommend anything any place but here"}
{"text":"I was here last night with my family. The food was great! Our hibachi chef was awesome! We had a great time."}
{"text":"My wife and I were in the neighborhood and decided to stop here on a whim. 

Upon entering the restaurant there was nothing special and two hostesses who weren't too knowledgeable about the menu. My wife and I decided to opt for just sushi and pass on hibachi this time. We had the usual maki rolls, California, Spicy Tuna, and Philadelphia rolls. We also tried the Ruby and Dragon rolls which were house specialty rolls which came recommended by the waitress. We also each got a side of fried rice. 

The food arrived in a timely manner and is what you would expect from standard maki rolls. The specialty rolls were very good. my wife and I really enjoyed the dragon roll. The ruby roll had a bit too much fish roe for our liking but was still decent. the fried rice, for some reason, was some of the best fried rice I've had in quite some time. 

All in all we had a very good meal at prices that were on par with comparable restaurants in the area. My wife and I will most likely return for another sushi dinner on Sunday, because they offer half price that day. I would certainly recommend the sushi for anyone interested in trying a new place."}
{"text":"This place has mediocre food; nothing special. We have eaten at the establishment here a few times but typically order take out when it's getting late and we are searching for a quick dinner bite. 

The only reason why we go is because we like the vibe; especially the vibe when you order takeout. It can be best described as Tarantino-esque. An almost silent HIBACHI restaurant is bizarre. A quiet, barely audible 'Asian' theme song plays on repeat. The clink of Fish tanks, no fish. Imaginary 'lines' employees don't cross over; almost like a game. The decorations don't make any sense and is probably last considered/reviewed in 1989. There does not seem to be any order or organization to the check-in process or take-out. 

Tonight, a very tall, bespectacled, man wearing a black turtleneck and a long black wool coat walked out like a robot. This is typical. 

All in all, such a weird place."}
{"text":"Great food and entertainment from the chef.  Ask for CJ for your hibachi grill chef!!

Definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"Visting my family from NYC, we chose this steakhouse out of the blue (the Winking Lizard used to be in this location). It was such a pleasure! We had Josh cook for us, who was AMAZING--so funny, cooked everything perfectly, and made no complaints and was totally ok with my younger niece switching her order last minute. The place is great, clean, and big. And it was the most entertained I had been for my whole visit back home. 5 stars! ;)"}
{"text":"We've been here several times.  The food is always excellent and the drinks are delicious! You'll never leave hungry as the portions are huge.  Try the filet mignon and teriyaki chicken combo, which is my favorite.  The strawberry daiquiris are the best I've ever had.   The cooks are always entertaining.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Fantastic all around. Prepare for an entertaining show and great food"}
{"text":"Half off sushi on Wednesdays. The rice and chicken is very good and fresh. Drinks are on the expensive side though but are very good. The deep fried filet mignon roll is really good. I like this location more than the Fairview Park and Highland Heights location."}
{"text":"Bottom Line:  The sushi is fresh and generally good quality, but the service is slow and sushi preparation inconsistent.  Prices are high compared to other sushi bars of similar quality 

I used to be a regular customer but will no longer patronize this business after a few bad experiences.  First, I have brought my family in on Sundays when it was not crowded and still had extremely slow service.

The straw that broke the camel's back was when I went in for a sushi lunch. I specifically came on Wednesday to take advantage of the buy one get one half off. I learned that they had changed their policy and are only offering this deal after 3 PM. Next, The sushi chef made my Alaska roll with the smoked rather than fresh salmon. When I complained, he told the waitress that Alaska rolls were made with smoked salmon. After she checked and found that I was correct, he finally agreed to make them again.  The waitress was apologetic but it really wasn't her fault.  Overall, not a good experience especially for around $50 for an admittedly large sushi lunch (3 handrolls, a roll, and 2 sushi).  I have given two stars because the sushi itself is always fresh."}
{"text":"High quality food that tastes amazing. Priced well considering you get soup, salad, sides, and a HUGE dinner portion. Appetizers are great too, try the tempura shrimp or veggies! I recommend ordering the Geisha (23$) for filet mignon, shrimp and chicken. Always delicious."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying this restaurant. I had been craving hibachi style cooking for a while.  I had been planning on visiting for a while so I checked out the menu online before going.  I have a picky eater so I needed to know what I was in for. I saw a possible meal for my little one online but not on the printed menu. When I inquired about it the waitress had no idea what I was talking about even after I showed her on my phone.  She said that it wasn't their website even though it had their address as well as their other location. At any rate we were seated by the hostess and while we waited for more people to be seated I noticed that the place wasn't exactly the cleanest.  There was still crumbs of food on the grill and on the sides of the grill.  The floor was also sticky and my glass of pepsi didn't look clean.  Another Yelp reviewer stated that the salad dressing was mayo.  I laughed when I saw it because it looked like a glob of spiced mayo. It actually wasn't too bad.  I ordered the combo hibachi dinner with strip steak and teriyaki chicken and fried rice instead of steamed.  The entire meal was way too salty.  I'm not sure where things went wrong.  The chef kept saying ooh this is Japanese ketchup as he poured lots of some sauce on the food. I don't know if it was soy sauce or not.  There was plenty of food  but it just didn't do it for me.  It wasn't worth what I paid and the fried rice was pitiful. Save your money and don't bother paying the extra $2.  I won't be going back.  Once was enough.  I'll stick with the chain restaurants.  By the way just a side note another Yelper mentioned the dirty fish tank that greets you.  Well its still filthy.  My kid liked it because it looked like Dori in Finding Nemo and followed his finger as he went from one side to another."}
{"text":"Families fighting... Salad dressing that tastes like mayonnaise. Not a fan. Won't be back"}
{"text":"After looking for restaurants on Christmas Eve after hitting the movies, we decided on trying the Hibachi Japanese Steakhouse. When we came in, we weren't sure if it was open. When someone came to seat us, there seemed like a long wait for a hibachi table. We had a regular table, and about 10 minutes after we were seated we saw a family that had been waiting finally get to their table. However, our regular table was fabulous! I can't speak for crowd sizes on normal days, but there was nobody sitting near us, so it was nice and quiet. Our waitress was great and checked up on us several times throughout our 45 minutes stay. It wasn't a very long wait for food: soup and salad came first, and then entrees. There was a choice of maybe 15 or so hibachi dinners that you could order not at the hibachi table, which was a nice touch because I don't like the chaos and noise of hibachi tables. Each hibachi dinner comes with onion soup, a salad, your choice of entree, and steamed white rice (which can be substituted for fried rice or noodles at an extra cost). I had a yakosabi hibachi dinner, which came with stir fried noodles, vegetables, a choice of chicken or beef, and steamed white rice, which came to a total of about $16. That might seem like a lot, but what I received could serve at least 3 people! There was a humongous pile of tasty noodles, varied vegetables, a HUGE amount of chopped beef, and a nicely sized side of white rice. I definitely did not finish all of it- I barely made a dent! I also ordered a kid's \"little mermaid\": a full sized Shirley temple mixed with pineapple juice, which was delicious. Everything was cooked nicely and was delicious. Would definitely come here again, and you have lunch and dinner for tomorrow!"}
{"text":"We got there with no reservation at primetime on a Saturday night, so we expected to wait a little while, but we did not expect the terrible service we got. They said it would be a 45 minute wait, and it was at least double that, probably closer to 2 hours. Yes, it was busy, but it definitely was NOT 2-hour wait busy, even if table-turnover time is slower at a hibachi restaurant. We spent this wait time at the bar, which was one of the worst run operations I've ever seen. The \"bartender\" didn't even acknowledge me for 20 minutes, and when she finally did, not ONCE but TWICE she took my order and completely forgot about it and walked over to serve other groups that arrived after me. Finally got my rum and coke and it tasted like it was 90% rum and 10% coke. Normally, I wouldn't complain about a stiff drink, but this was so absurdly strong that I might as well have been drinking about 10-12 oz of straight rum and I had to drive. After this, I was watching the bartender serve other customers and she made almost every drink with way too much booze. Plus, she was the only one tending bar and running around like crazy while at least three other women just meandered around with no sense of urgency. I didn't tip her for the poor service and in hindsight, I feel kind of bad, but a tip is earned, not inherently deserved, especially when the bar is only wide enough to seat maybe 8 people across..

While we were waiting at the bar to be seated, we got the strong impression that we were forgotten and went and asked few times when our name would be called to be seated because we saw people coming in after us getting seated. The hostess was visibly annoyed by this. I imagine a lot of them had reservations, so I understand this, but there is no way that every single group that came in after us had a reservation. After our two hour wait, we finally got to a seat at a hibachi and waited another 20 minutes for a server to get over to us. We looked at the sushi menu for an appetizer and saw rolls ranging from 6-10 dollars, which is a fair sushi price. We decided on the sushi sampler for $12 thinking that it would be a nice spread since it was double the price of some rolls. The people at our table got their sushi rolls and they were pretty standard nice size 8-piece rolls. We got our sampler...6 pieces. two dollars per piece is highway robbery. Not only that, but they weren't even temaki rolls, they were nigiri-zushi which is just rice balls with a piece of fish on top. No seaweed, no avocado, no cucumber....just a hunk of rice with a piece of fish on top, and only one piece per type. It was lazy and they should be embarrassed to call that a \"sampler\" and charge double price for it.
The miso was pretty good. It wasn't too salty or too bland like a lot of miso soups tend to be, and it had nice big chunks of mushroom in it. I was pleased with that element. The salad was mostly lettuce with not much variety and the ginger dressing tasted like mayonnaise with a little bit of the ginger dressing flavor. Definitely not the best dressing I've ever had, but it was tolerable.
The hibachi chef finally came out, I'd say within a reasonable amount of time. He was okay, did all the same things every hibachi chef does...big plume of fire on the grill, onion volcano, shrimp tossing, spinning the egg and saying \"egg roll,\" etc. but the chef seemed hurried even though we were literally one of the last tables there, he just seemed like he didn't want to be there. I had the mako shark and it was really good. The veggies that came with it were really good also. The yum-yum sauce was on point though. One complaint I have, however, is that the already pricey meals come with white rice but they charge you an additional $2.00 for fried rice. I've never been to another hibachi that charges you extra for fried rice. It usually comes with the meal.
So after the chef finished, we tipped him decently because he made some good food even though he wasn't a super personable hibachi chef. It may have just been because of how irritated I was that I wasn't that into it. The server was slow and not really very friendly at all, so I still tipped her but mainly because she was pregnant and not because she was a great server.
On top of all this, I think my bill was too high, but couldn't tell because it wasn't itemized. I didn't say anything, though, because I had already been there for 3-3 1/2 hours and I REALLY didn't feel like sitting there any longer and waiting for this not-so-friendly waitress to give me attitude then ultimately pay the ticketed price anyways. My group was planning on going out for drinks afterwards, but by the time we got out of there at 9:30 (we arrived at 6:00).  
Needless to say, I will not be visiting this restaurant again. I love hibachi-style Japanese restaurants and have visited several with a very similar concept to Hibachi over the years but this one was ruined for me by some of the slowest service I've ever had."}
{"text":"I would have loved this place if it weren't for all of the salt!! Seriously, wow - I know this cuisine is usually more on the salty side, but the amount of salt in the soup as well as in my veggie hibachi dinner was unreal. The highlight of the meal was definitely our server. He always had a smile and was so polite. Not sure if I would try this place again."}
{"text":"Staff was nice!  Hibachi / meats were good...a little heavy on the sauce.  Sushi rolls were also heavy in the sauce department and a bit loose.  Taste was good though!!!   We will come again, not sure when, but it's a keeper!"}
{"text":"My husband and I dined here this evening and he described it as a \"terrible dining experience.\" The table top around the grill was sticky, and the server brought my husband some raw sushi when he had ordered the smoked salmon. When my husband asked about this, the waiter said \"oh yeah, you can't tell it's smoked because it's, ya know, salmon.\" So why not mention that beforehand? Especially when my husband asked to see the list of cooked sushi?? After all that and they didn't even have the graciousness to remove it from the bill. My husband's had better actually cooked sushi from Giant Eagle!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately we had a similar experience to most of the other reviewers -- not good.  It was cold at our table with the vent open while we waited for our chef. The place seemed dirty, tables were warped and the floor was greasy. The server took a long time to greet us and take drink orders. When the drinks arrived they were wrong. One person asked for a hot tea, which never arrived, but was on the bill at the end. Another person asked for a glass to pour her beer in, which never arrived. We had to ask (and ask again) to get refills on soda and water. Special requests (e.g. steamed rice instead of fried) were ignored until we reminded the server. An appetizer was ordered, never arrived, and was on the bill at the end. 

The chef was pretty skilled and entertaining. Everyone thought the food tasted good, so that's a plus. 

Gratuity of 18% is added for parties of six or more, which is probably a good strategy since the service is so poor. After getting the bill corrected at the end, we vowed never to go back. 

Pros: Pretty good selection of food and entertaining/somewhat unique preparation. 

Cons:  Everything else."}
{"text":"I loved this location. Friendly staff and nice atmosphere. We went for Wednesday half off Sushi night. I was pleased with the selection and I think the Kung Fu is my favorite. 
We will definitely return. I took food home to take for lunch the next day. This was a great choice."}
{"text":"We just came here a few days ago and it was terrible. I usually try to see the best in my reviews but this was bad. 
We called ahead to see if we could make a reservation for a pretty big crowd, around 14 people. They gave us a time and said no problem. We arrived 15 minutes early and were told we have to wait. That was fine! Used to waiting! But they kept telling us we had to wait for over an hour! It was for 7:30, we didn't sit down until 8:45.  One of the busboys even told me it was total BS that she had to keep telling us we had to wait. We just wanted to eat. Our waitress was very sweet but they really needed more people working, not enough staff for a Saturday night. We were split into 2 tables but served at random times, no salad for us but our other table had it. But we are first and our guests waited till we were just about done to just start cooking. :/ 
We will not be returning unfortunately when Fuji steak house is right down the road and is always on top of their service."}
{"text":"Best sushi in town. We have sat at the bar many times and watched Willie, the sushi cheif, perform his magic.  He is a true artist. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Me and the girlfriend met earlier and decide to get a bite afterwards. We both decided on hibachi. Went to this place. Have never been there till today even though I've seen it many times from the outside. We go in with some other people and were seated together at opposite sides of the table. We went here late on a Sunday so no one was really there. Sushi presentation was great. On the other hand the hibachi part was not as good. Don't get wrong, it's above average food. It was just not to my liking. The shrimp and scallops were excellent. The atmosphere was nice and our server was really, really nice. Way to go Yen! Our cook was awesome and really made the experience great. And yes, they did do the shrimp toss."}
{"text":"Came in as a party of 10, & wow were we very pleased. it looked as if they were already closing, the server was still able to give us her full attention, I think it was sheera? We come to this place here and there especially my son that had his birthday. our group of teens loved the new chef cj we never had before. dirty jokes with the teens like cum-cum sauce that my son yelled out but still took at professionally and got them to laugh and have fun. Such a young chef  very skilled and cooked very fast, shrimp throwing was spot on across the room, Came in around 9 and we were able to eat and get everything done by 9:45 without feeling rushed. Will recommened to my friends and family."}
{"text":"Beware ,,, they charge a 6 dollar sharing fee if you sit and only order tea.  This is below average food, nice experience, above average price for poor quality food.  There are much better hibachi restaraunts out there."}
{"text":"Spent a whole day here and ate more than enough in ~12 hrs to weigh an extra large-sized toddler.

Especially loved:
-Basil fried rice, I don't even like rice but this hit the spot
-Some cucumber wrapped sushi roll with some fish inside, forgot what it was called but super refreshing and tasty
-Ribeye for hibachi, juiciest meat of the bunch
-Cheesecake, IDGAF that they didn't make it but I liked it
-The manager/bartender here (think her name is Stephanie?), would totally tap, perfect 10 in my book"}
{"text":"I can only speak to the lunch express, not the hibachi grill experience, but I always leave full and satisfied for under $12 including tip, which for lunch is not bad. I stick to the hibachi chicken options and haven't had a bad version yet. My favorite is the siracha chicken but I would also recommend the pineapple chicken or bourbon chicken, but you can't really go wrong.  You can get rice or noodles, and either a salad or soup. The onion and mushroom soup really hits the spot for me. If you want some extra spice in addition to the yum yum sauce, ask for some wasabi and mix it with soy sauce. 

My lunch bunch really enjoy the hibachi 2 meat combo for $13 to $15, and they pick two of salmon, steak, scallops, shrimp etc.  Tuesday and Wednesday are buy one get one half off sushi rolls. The spider and firecracker would be my votes. 

I will say sometimes the service has been hit or miss, but as of recently (April 2018) their new staff has really improved on the precious lunch staff. I am really shocked by the other reviews. The floor is sometimes sticky but the food is quick, the portions are filling, and the prices aren't bad for hibachi."}
{"text":"Have only been once.  I am always suspect of restaurants where the Sushi isn't made at a sushi bar right in front of God and everybody.  Sorry, Charley..."}
{"text":"We returned for a family birthday dinner. Our server, Cat and the Chef, CJ, did a great job. Cat was efficient and friendly and CJ was entertaining and professional. The meat and vegetables looked very fresh and were cooked appropriately to requested order - everything was good and in solid portions.

We had a Hawaiian roll which was really tasty, with nice salmon and avocado and a nice crunchy tempura inside with spicy salmon. Our 10 year old loves sushi and sushi rolls and she enjoyed that one. 

We had shrimp, chicken and steak on the hibachi along with vegetables, rice and noodles - a little of everything - and CJ did a great job juggling, joking, and cooking with the obligatory volcano, fake-out with the sauce bottle and all the other more or less expected parts of the cooking routine that went along with making good meals. Some of his goofy food jokes and puns were pretty good, and we've been to enough of these places that we thought we had heard all of them. He actually had some new ones.

We had seven meals for $175 including tip - we added a little onto the tip that was automatically added on, I assume, for our party size of seven (and that drives me crazy, too but I get it) - with non-alcoholic beverages and no dessert. Soup and salad go with the Hibachi combos as well as the usual dipping sauces, \"yum-yum\" sauce and a sweet sort of Ponzu. Although generally Asian restaurant salads are not really worth commenting on, I will say that the dinner salad was for whatever reason much better than the lunch salad I had in the previous review. The soup was tasty, although (and this would be my only extremely minor quibble of the night) I would have liked it to be hotter. (My wife thought it was fine.)

Overall, we enjoyed it very much. There are many options for teppenyaki style Japanese within 20 minutes of where we live, not far from Hibachi - another just down Rockside road, Broadview Heights, Brecksville, Beachwood and Macedonia all have one. For about $25 a person, we had about 10-11 meals worth of food and a great time which certainly competed well with any of those, and it's proximity means we will very likely be back."}
{"text":"I don't know what everyone is talking about!!!  I Really like the food here.The portions are decent and everything tasted fine. They have volcano drink they light on fire and you can get a free dinner on your birthday. The chefs are funny too. Yes it is VERY dirty though, but in a restaurant where they fling shrimp into their diners pie whole from across the hibachi what can you expect!?!?! They also squirt generous streams of sake down your gullet. I can't argue with that!  Yes, they have teriyaki streaking down their walls and you might slip and fall on a rogue shrimp but I have never had a bad dinner here."}
{"text":"Ewwww. So gross. The rugs when you walk in are filthy. The plates had chips on them, lettuce from salad was brown and so on.. very disappointing and not clean.

They need a good cleaning in restaurant."}
{"text":"Ordered the sushi maki lunch.  The tuna was fair, and the spicy tuna was not spicy.  The salmon was okay, and the California roll was bland.  I think they just had someone working with a basic knowledge, but I hope it wasn't their regular sushi chef. I also had an issue with pricing, they over charged me and stated that the owner changed the prices in the computer but not on the menus.  Guess what?  Not my fault.  I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I ordered takeout, Big mistake! First off my food was cold, I live not even 10 min. Away. I ordered noodles and rice, no noodles and minimal rice that was not cooked thoroughly. I called and was told I could return for some noodles, Uh NO!My Salmon was flaked and should have been whole. My onions had skin on them still and were not edible! My good looked as though it was left over from someone else's dinner. My Crunch roll was soggy, I just waisted $37 on some leftovers! Never again!!!"}
{"text":"It's not the best Hibachi I've ever had but it does the job.

My family and I decided to come here for dinner after shopping in the area. I had an immense craving for fried rice with yum yum sauce, so I did a quick Yelp search of hibachi restaurants near me and found this spot. 

Myself and my family came inside and waited a bit to be greeted, but the hostess was very friendly when she did notice us. We decided to opt for a regular table because we weren't in the mood for dinner and a show, so I can't speak to this place's hibachi chefs' performances.

This restaurant is much larger than I expected. I like the low-lighting and the decorations were nice. As some have noted, the tables are a bit sticky, but other than that everything seemed clean. Our waitress was very nice and attentive. The weird thing is that we were the only diners in the restaurant at 7:00pm on a Friday night. I don't know how this place would be if it were busy, or even if it get busy. 

As for food, all of my family members opted for hibachi of course. I got the filet hibachi, which comes with clear soup, salad, filet, rice, and vegetables. I was really put off by the fact that you need to pay extra for fried rice. Typically this comes with a hibachi meal.

The clear onion soup was OK. The fried onions seemed a bit off, like they were stale, and the soup had a kind of weird, chemical-y aftertaste. Our salad was interesting. The ginger dressing was creamy and unlike any hibachi place I've been to before. I can understand where people are coming from when they say that the dressing resembles mayonnaise. I enjoyed the salad, but can see how others may dislike it.

The main course, filet mignon hibachi, was underwhelming. My steak was under-seasoned, but cooked to a perfect medium rare, so I appreciate that. My hibachi vegetables were alright. The rice was bland. My family members got the chicken hibachi and similarly were underwhelmed by their meals.


Ultimately, I might come back here if the prices were more in line with the food. The hibachi entrees are expensive and paying extra for fried rice is odd for me. There are other hibachi restaurants in the area with similar prices and significantly better food."}
{"text":"So this place is your typical Hibachi place, which has a chef who will grill in front of you and entertain you while you eat. You can also opt to get sushi as well. They have a fully stocked bar and have daily bar specials. 

So I checked this place out because I had a Groupon. Contrary to other reviews, they did not give me a hard time with my Groupon-- I just followed the rules and made a reservation in advance. 

The ambiance here was okay. The entrance was nicely decorated and the bar was nice and clean, but just past the entrance I saw a hibachi station which was under construction, or in some random state of disarray. Not sure what was going on there.

The food was cheaper than other hibachi places (e.g. Bennihana), I had the Teryaki chicken which was only $14, so yeah, pretty cheap for hibachi. Most of the other seafood entrees were around the $18-20 mark. Portion size was great and compared to other hibachi places. Definitely enough to take home leftovers! 

However, the food did not taste as good to me as the other hibachi places I've been to. For instance, the shrimp and steak sauce served with everyone's meal tasted a little off. Steak sauce was much to sweet, and shrimp sauce tasted more mayonnaise-y than usual. The fried rice was okay, but more hard than fluffy. My chicken was good, but maybe not as flavorful as Benihana. Also, the salad dressing was thick and creamy, when I would prefer light and ginger-y. Overall, the food was still good, but not mind-blowingly excellent."}
{"text":"Had my first experience here the other day. The menu had quite a selection with mildly expensive food WITH NO PICTURES unfortunately.

I decided to get something to recognized to start off with, while we waited for our food the waiter served us salad and soup as an appetizer and I must say I really enjoyed the soup a lot, the salad they have us was also pretty good.

When it came time to make our order was when things got interesting, they would cook it on the grill right in front of it and to get to see the process of your food getting done which was pretty cool, but you have to be careful of the fire because its quite a sight to behold your first time.

The food I had overall was pretty good and the experience I had while I was there was nice too. I would definitely go back again and be a little adventurous and try out other things on the Menu."}
{"text":"We were here with a large group, arrived before they opened and were seated almost as soon as they let us in.  The waitress was very friendly, and we didn't have to wait really long for our \"chef\", or whatever you call them......haha.  They brought soup and salad first, both of which were good.  I've been here before, and it's always a fun time, though our guy this time was a terrible shot with the shrimp....lol.  The food was very good, but there was SO much, and it kinda tasted like the sauces were all the same.  My Bourbon Chicken sauce tasted pretty much like what was on the swordfish. Other than that, no real complaints, except that the floor seemed really sticky....eeesh."}
{"text":"We made a reservation, arrived on time, they were  not prepared, so our whole family (party of 12+) had to sit to wait in the bar for 30 minutes before being seated, once seated... No one ever came to take even our drink order for over 20 minutes. We asked politely many times to be served at least drinks. Eventually a female server came over and was very rude to my great aunt so we all ended up leaving for the Westlake Hibachi (Arashi) it was much better and cleaner."}
{"text":"Went for my birthday, Pretty good food, server and the chef were very nice to me and my friends and helped us with any problems that popped up.
Entertainment from the chef was pretty fun to watch with his tricks and jokes. 

Floor was a bit sticky due to too much soap in their mop water I assume. 

Was also pretty cold until the chef started getting up some fires.

Warning: They automatically include gratuity into the check if it's it's your birthday, FYI."}
{"text":"Both kids had the same dish, and ended up getting food poisoning. The place is kinda dirty looking, like it's on its last leg before closing. The chefs are pretty funny. After dealing with vomit and diarrhea, we won't be coming back."}
{"text":"The food was good last Sunday afternoon.  The show was typical.  The waitress was attentive.  The restaurant was empty except the five of us at the table.  (Something for church goers to consider.  Walk right in!)  Now the bad part.  They had a Groupon, which is what prompted us to try them.  All went well until the check came.  They charge an 18% gratuity because of the Groupon, and they don't warn you about it.  I get that this is done (hopefully) because of chintzy cheap customers.   I get it but I am not one of them!  (My ongoing theme is Why do we have to pay for the bad people?!)  Well, in my case, they cheated themselves out of 2% of the 20% tip I was going to leave.  That little gratuity thing left a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"I went with a group of 12 last night. It is a very tight squeeze for 12 around a cook top. We loved our cook. He was fun and personable. I've never seen deep fried sushi but the hibachi roll was delicious. They offered many meat options as well as combos so you could get a couple of items. The red blend wine was delicious too! We all loved our meal and I would certainly return!"}
{"text":"This was my second experience at Hibachi Japanese Steakhouse.  I'd rate the first experience as a 4 (decent food, decent serving staff, attentive chef).  However, my experience last night requires that I write a review to express concerns about this restaurant.  

A group of seven of us arrived to Hibachi for a reservation and were seated immediately when our full group was there.  The hostess sat another group at the hibachi grill directly across our table about five minutes later after we had received our beverages.  We wasted no time in ordering and placed our order the first opportunity given to us by the server.  We received soup and salad in a somewhat slow fashion, but tolerable.  Water glasses were empty for a while and we had to flag over our server to get more water.  After one hour and five minutes of being seated (we checked our watches), I tried to get the server's attention but she walked past us.  Five minutes later she came over to tell us that she put in some apps for us because of the delay without an apology and with our water glasses being empty once again.  I asked to speak with a manager and she initially tried to brush me off without agreeing to bring the manager over.  

The manager finally came over six minutes later.  The manager was equally as unsympathetic saying \"this stuff happens sometimes\" even as I explained that we were seated and ordered before the table in front of us and they all now had their hibachi food while we continued to sit there.  She said that our server put in an app for us so that should fix our problem.  I reiterated that it did not fix the problem since we were still waiting for a chef to come to our table.  I told her that the least she could do is comp a meal.  She tried to tell me she didn't have the authority to do that so I asked to speak to someone who did have such authority.  She said she would send her boss over.  That went unpromised as no other \"manager\" approached the table.

The apps our server allegedly placed for us did not arrive for another few minutes, thereby demonstrating that she had just placed the order when I tried to get her attention.  The original \"manager\" returned to our table after I requested from the server that the manager with authority come to speak with us.  Our server said that her manager told her it was already handled, without that \"manager\" ever returning to tell us the same (or to send the person who had authority to handle customer complaints).  I requested the manager once again because none of this was communicated to us, nor did we know what \"handled\" meant.  (i.e. we were still without a chef at our table)

The \"manager\" gave us the run-around during each of our two interactions with her.  She insisted at first that we would have an automatic tip added to our bill because there were seven of us.  I had to insist that I would dispute the entire bill in order for her to remove this.  My intention was not to avoid tipping - but not to tip 18-20% for a meal that took 1.5 hours before we even had a chef.  She never communicated to us that the tip was removed, but our later bill did not have it. 

The chef (Keith, I believe) was amazing and attentive to our table.  He was truly apologetic on behalf of the restaurant and made up for the first horrible 1.5 hours.  Likewise, we never saw our server again that evening.  However, we asked Keith if he could ask the server behind us to refill our waters when he had a chance (Kevin, I believe).  Kevin was great and took care of water refills, to-go containers, and brought us the bill at that time.  We ensured that both of these individuals were tipped for providing us with a good experience.

This restaurant needs to hire an experienced manager who handled customer complaints appropriately.  I have vast experience in the serving industry and understand that sometimes the kitchen falls behind and there are problems outside of your control.  The initial complaint was merely to make sure these issues were addressed.  The manager's response was truly unacceptable.  She lacked any sense of apology or empathy for the SUBSTANTIAL delay we had in receiving our food.  She made a promise she didn't keep (never sent over the other manager) and did not communicate with our table, but avoided it.  I'm not sure why Hibachi  has a manager like her, but I hope they provide her with substantial training so that others do not experience the same horrible experience we had.  

Kevin and Keith were amazing and turned an awful evening into a decent one.  I rarely complain to a manager, but when things are ridiculously slow, something needs to be done by the restaurant and not just putting in appetizers for greasy food that no one at the table wanted.  This would be a zero star for the first 1.25 hours of our experience.  I would give the latter half of the evening a much higher rating, but still a zero star for the management."}
{"text":"WTF !!! I follow some comments, but this is one of the most dirty place I ever seen. The food is a joke, and the \"chef\" doing some tricks with his fork and knife : big joke. Avoid this place!!!"}
{"text":"The best thing about this restaurant is the location- it's convenient for me during the work day.  I love sushi, so it's a treat to get a roll or two during work hours. I stopped in to place a to go order, since I had other shopping to do at the plaza. There were only 3-4 people at the bar during lunch hours, the restaurant was dark, and the hostess was pretty disinterested. Still, I ordered an Ocean Roll and 2 Japanese egg rolls- came to $18, which is pretty high compared to other Japanese establishments in the area. The hostess gave me my bill, then walked away while I was signing the check at the hostess stand. I then called out to her to ask when my order would be ready, since she hadn't told me. 15 minutes. Ok, that was reasonable. 

I returned a little early, and had to wait a few minutes, which was fine. 

When I returned to work several minutes later, I opened my lunch. The egg rolls were very good- crispy inside, soft inside, with lots of flavor. Still, probably not worth $4 for what we're essentially 2 spring rolls. The sushi was pretty good, but the rice was a little mushy, and the sauce was everywhere . It was just very messy looking. The portion size is what I would expect, but given the price ($14), the seafood portions could have been more generous. 

Takeaway: this place is ok if it is all you have time for. Otherwise, if you want great sushi for a good price, I would choose Pacific East, Otani, etc."}
{"text":"The absolute slowest place ever. Honestly waited over an hour for our food - and we were the ONLY people in the restaurant. They do know that sushi is mostly uncooked fish, right?

UPDATE: 2 hours from our initial sit down until we received our last sushi roll."}
{"text":"My family and I went there for the first time and we absolutely loved it. The chef was great. The server was awesome. And the atmosphere was great. We'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Best hibachi around hands down. You definitely get your monies worth. Food and service are both outstanding."}
{"text":"My wife daughter and I ate here last night horrible experience. First off chef lit match for fire and part of the match hit my wife in the face. Second thing is they throw hot grilled shrimp u try and catch. He threw one at me and it missed and hit my daughter in the face. Not to mention it almost hit my wife who is allergic to shrimp. Lastly they have a rule parties of 5 automatically get charged 18%. We had two parties next to us with desperate checks they thought were together and refused to take off gratuity. As I was walking out I heard manager state to waitress they put automatic tip because they were African american and they don't tip well. I flipped out and yelled at them and I think I am contacting the news. Please avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Hey Yelpers,

Here's are the TOP SIX things you need to know about Hibachi Japanese Steakhouse:

1.) The food here is merely average. The fried rice was a little disappointing and everything else was okay at best. Oh, and the salad was gross. Yuck. 
2.) Unlike some other Yelp reviews I actually found the service to be pretty amazing. Our waitress was extremely kind and refilled water glasses frequently.
3.) The decor inside is dated, feels slightly dirty, and features WAY too much oak for my tastes. The bathroom also featured some weird urinal/sink placement. The place was also kind of empty for a Friday night (probably reflective of other reviews).
4.) This may sound a bit weird, but I'm pretty sure that our chef was playing a caricature of an Asian hibachi chef. I actually found it a little offensive.
5.) The food was cooked in a really weird manner with our meat coming out first and the rice coming out last. It wasn't the way I've typically seen it done.
6.) The chef very awkwardly asked for tips at the end of grilling. Other people tipped but I didn't have any cash. I've never seen the chef ask for tips directly before. Typically I just tip at the end and assume the server and chef have an agreement.

WILL I BE GOING BACK? Unlikely. It's priced like a 3 to 4 star Hibachi restaurant but doesn't deliver the same experience.

Sincerely,
Neal"}
{"text":"Overly salted, they do not know when to stop. 
My wife and I had a combo of shrimp and scallops with an extra $2.00 up charge each for fried rice, otherwise you only get white rice. They use to give you fried rice as part of the meal, isn't that why you go to the grill for Hibachi food not white rice?
They start with a nice bowl of heavily salted mushroom soup with a nice salad (no salt thank goodness).
After the hibachi chef? makes a fool out of himself and everyone at the table and sings a horrible out of tune rendition of Happy Birthday in half Korean,  he starts to make the food.
The fried rice gets fried egg, then a heavy dose of soy sauce, lots of salt, a dose of salted butter or margarine,  a little more soy and a little more salt.
The shrimp and scallops also get all of the above even though it has it's own salt from the sea and also gets a dose of salty teriyaki sauce. You wind up tasting the sauce and salt rather then the sweetness of the scallops. Everybody at the table got their steaks, chicken and seafood soaked in salted brine. My wife can't even eat her leftovers because of her blood pressure issues. 
The food would have been good if we could have tasted it."}
{"text":"Hibachi.. uhh, ByeBotchy!  One and done for us. Crammed us all in the back room while rest of place was Empty, had to be about 78deg in there, plus our vent didn't work so we were choking on smoke!  The show was very basic, just the flaming volcano. No tricks, nor food flipping.  
The chicken was pretty good, veggies fine but fried rice was not great. Of course soup and salad was kinda lame. 
Told em I was Allergic to shrimp but they offered no sub. 
Most everything we touched had a coating of grease on it.  Ceiling tiles in bathroom were rotten with large holes & falling thru!  Good thing we had a Group-on or I'd feel like really complaining."}
{"text":"Not sure I'd come back here. We had to wait for our whole party to arrive before being seated which was annoying, but I was kinda thankful for in the end as it was really cold in the place until they started cooking. It warmed up real quick when the fire started rolling. Most stuff was heavy on the fried or super oily. The chef also had a super fake accent, kinda wondered if he practices in a mirror. The one thing I was really disappointed with was the chef lacked tricks. At the end he flicked shrimp into peoples mouths but no one succeeded on catching any."}
{"text":"Not the greatest Hibachi restaurant in the area, but for price and service, can't be beat. 
Our waitress was so pleasant and right on top of our refills (it was 5 pm, so it wan't too busy). 
The rice was not up to par, but the scallops and chicken were great. 
Sushi was very fresh. 
Chef was average. part of the fun of Hibachi is the show that the Chef puts on. He was really kind of boring-but the food was perfect . 
It was my daughters birthday, so her meal was free. 
The decor is dated, but I'm not there to sight-see. I'm there to eat! 
They added 18% gratuity, which is normally for parties of 6 or more, but the waitress earned it. We tipped the chef separately. 
I'll go back again soon."}
{"text":"They still have tiki face mug drinks! I don't know who that lady that replied to my earlier review was, but my hero server informs me that they still have tiki mug drinks!  Love love love"}
{"text":"Average overall. Lunchtime meal at the bar is a bad idea as they don't have enough coverage whatsoever. Parking is a nightmare and google maps will take you 7 miles away until it realizes it and sends you to Wendy's."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good! We were greeted by a nice friendly hostess. The service was prompt and the Mai Tai was goooood! I ordered the vegetable stir fry which was very good, definitely too much food! My husband ordered the meat trio which he seemed to enjoy. Overall a great experience and we would definitely come back."}
{"text":"We frequent hibachi in our house. It's entertaining for the kids and the food is ok. However, the last four trips, the entertainment value has been slowing decreasing. It seems like the chefs just don't care anymore. We went there last night for my daughters 4th birthday....apparently it was birthday night bc every table had one. I made a point tot the waitress to let the chef know. I also told the chef, however he neglected or forgot and I was left with a disappointed 4 year old asking me why all the other tables sang happy birthday. I promptly pointed this out to management and someone did come over and sing...however...it was a moot point bc no fire, no fanfare. 
The food is average at best and the prices are fair, but it seems like everyone there is giving up and doesn't care anymore. In my opinion, hibachi has been on a slow downward spiral for the past year. While Wasabi and Otani might be a little more money, the value is significantly better and worth every additional penny."}
{"text":"This place is the ultimate worst.   
I am disgusted about our dinner and service and management from last nights dinner.
First I am allergic to shrimp and the cook decides to fling hot shrimp off the grill into my husbands mouth with no warning. 
It did bounce off me.
Upon lighting the grill, the cook struck a match and a piece hit my chin.
The ultimate is there were 3 parties at our table.    Us and 2 black parties.  All parties of 3.   The black had 18% gratuities added on their checks as we did not.
Totally disgusted and I am thinking of contacting the City.   
I do not want to be in a city that is part of this culture."}
{"text":"I had never been here and will NEVER go back. The place is disgusting, even the floors are sticky. I ordered sushi to start with that never came, which is probably for the best. The place was empty yet our \"server\" could not keep up. The drinks, which took far too long to get, were shitty and small. Over all bad experience...never again."}
{"text":"This was the absolute worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant. When my girlfriend and I arrived we were told to wait, even though they weren't that busy and we had reservations. After 30 minutes we finally got seated and ordered drinks, which took 20 minutes to arrive. We saw a busboy clean a table with dirty dishwater and then we were told that the chefs were switching shifts which was why things were going so slow. They finally got the soup and salad out to us which were absolutely disgusting because the soup was cold and the salad looked like it was assembled by a three-year-old. At this point it had been almost an hour and a half and the chef finally came out but he was clearly untrained because all the food he made was improperly portioned and inedible. At this point I was hungry and angry so I told the manager I just wanted to leave and she told me I didn't have to worry about paying and then broke down in tears. When the chef saw that we were leaving he sarcastically yelled out after us. I don't know if it was just a bad night or if the quality of this place is just that lousy but I wouldn't have wished this experience on my worst enemy. I was embarrassed for them."}
{"text":"Seriously? These people have no clue. Went there on a saturday with no reservation expecting a wait. Were told 20-25 minutes. An hour later i asked about a table. Was told we were next. Another table got seated so i asked the hostess why that wasnt ours. She pointed to another and said 'thats yours'. 10 minutes later they seated another group at 'our' table! The manager was no help and the hostess couldnt care less. I cant make this stuff up!  If it's gonna be an hour or more, tell me, so I can decide if I want to wait.  1.5 hours later we went to Longos, got seated immediately and had some good pasta. I guess Hibachi doesnt know about Yelp.  Worst staff ever, can't tell you if the food is any good, because we never got seated."}
{"text":"Wow this place was fun and tasty even for 8:30 pm on a Monday night!  

Food was very, very tasty and even though the Chef was a bit awkward, it was still a fun time.

Drinks were pricy but had a wide selection of Asian beers."}
{"text":"I'm not a hibachi person, so maybe I'm extra hard on it, but I wasn't a fan. The smell from outside is intoxicating. It's meat. Delicious, red meat. But inside it was just okay. 

Reading a few other reviews I agree totally. The interior is meh. And the asking for a tip thing was very awkward. Also I couldn't agree more about \"playing a character\". I am not convinced his english was so limited as he let on. I asked what the blob of crisco looking stuff was and he wouldn't answer me. I'm sorry, but if you are going to make my food in front of me and I ask you what it is, tell me. I'm not running an inquisition here. 

The food overall was okay, I guess. I just wasn't impressed or excited. And it definitely seemed pricy, but I find that in most hibachi places."}
{"text":"We had reservations thinking Saturday night would be busy.we arrived at 615pm we waited 10 minutes to be seated
There was two grills that had people sitting.we were seated in front and waited here for 29 minutes and no one acknowledged  us.i went to front and no hostess.i saw two employees sitting at a table talking
I explained and they stated the hostess should of told us we were here.duh are you blind? The grill master gave a exact show we just observed across from us
Our bill with no alcohol was 80 dollars they charged us each two dollars for brown rice instead white
Come on. You can buy 50 lb bag for 8 dollats t.hey add the tip in bill so no matter how the food or service your stuck.the floors are very sticky walking on them
When we left at 745pm only two more customers arrived
I wonder why"}
{"text":"The hibachi chef did a really great job with my gluten free, celiac daughter and also my vegetarian daughter. He identified who had what diets, cooked the gluten free meal first and then the vegetarian one in an area separate from any meats, then cooked the other meals. 

The floor is slippery, as noted in other reviews, and it can be a little awkward trying to crawl in and out of the hibachi booth, but I liked that the hibachi bench was very deep so that you had plenty of room to put your purses and bags behind you, or you can even walk on that bench area behind you to get out. It was also nice to have the two hibachi tables facing each other (the chef's were back to back) to accommodate our large party. 

We all enjoyed our hibachi meals, and those who had sushi also were happy. The only negative was how hot it was inside the restaurant, especially on the hibachi side, on an already hot summer day. Otherwise we all had a good experience!"}
{"text":"Every time I come here I Have to get their Flaming Volcano alcoholic beverage (along with a couple of other cocktails), It is lit on fire and is absolutely DELICIOUS! Another plus is that the food is so good (Tsunami is my go to), and the staff is so kind. This is my favorite steakhouse to go to in the area. The manager walks around and asks how everyone's food is, just really good vibes here. It can get busy on the weekends, but the wait is SO worth it."}
{"text":"Get the Teriyaki Salmon! Everyone at our table was commenting on how they should have gotten it. You get TWO delicious fillets of salmon, soup, salad and rice or noodles(yum!) - so lots of leftovers for lunch the next day :)"}
{"text":"I wish I had read these reviews before going and wasting my money. 
Service bad, untrained
Food, old, no freshness, and quality far below other hibatchi restaurants. 
Management- this place is \"family\" owned, but no \"ownership\" is present, was told they can't afford to refund an unhappy guest but would give me a $ 20 gift card to come back, to which would lead me to have to spend more money as the menu is over priced. 
Giant eagle has better sushi, and pick up some ramen while your there. Get your business together Benny and train your management."}
{"text":"Excellent service! Everyone has a really warm hospitality and chefs are full of nice tricks! Thank y'all very much! I would totally come back again!"}
{"text":"Visited this establishment on a Friday evening with my family. What a disaster. Sushi was terrible, mushy rice. The large roll was $12 and came to the table the size of a regular roll for $5 and not the right ingredients.  Once pointed out, they brought a few extra pieces that were indeed the roll we first ordered, but again, the size of a $5 roll. They charged $2 PER PERSON for fried rice which only an egg and soy sauce was added. The restaurant was NOT clean and to top off our experience, they added more of a tip(we tipped 15%) onto our debit card which WE now have to dispute. My family is very fortunate, we eat out 3 or more times a week. This is THE WORST experience we've EVER encountered. Please don't waste your money! FUJI in mentor is terrific compared to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I was weary of the previous reviews but they seemed to be true. Food was average, service nice but semi rush, and experience for my wife and two kids poor for a first time experience with the kids. 

I even made online reservations and when we showed up they screwed up and didn't have them. Which turned up to put us on a 8 seat service with only the four of us which then made them rush us out of the table due to the volume of people waiting on a cleared seat.

Definitely not the best food for the price and which makes this even worse is the fact we live in the area and word of mouth spreads easily."}
{"text":"This place is sad looking. I would only come here to do hibachi in a group setting. It's not very crowded so you will feel the restaurant is yours. So dreary looking and always empty. Had the sushi, not bad."}
{"text":"Ugh.  I should stop there, but I want to spare you a trip. Hibachi is looking shabby and tired. I can always overlook that for good food and service.  The service was decent, the food was ok/unremarkable and the restaurant was filthy.

I have never written a review using the word gross, but...then again, my next stop after Yelp will be the county board of health to see what I can find.  It's been several years since I ate at this joint and tonight those pleasant past experiences were washed away faster than you can wash off Hibachi smoke.  

Cherry stems from prior guests were just some of the things littering our table and seating area - which, disturbingly had been \"cleaned\", smearing filth around.  Watching other tables get bussed, I understood the smearing process better.

When you go to a Hibachi restaurant I think you should assume there's a certain amount of smoke and grease that go with it, so please understand this is not a naive first time visit.

One of our party went to the ladies room where the dirty, messy restroom was topped off by tampon remnants.  A restaurant is not responsible for the piggy behavior of guests, but to some extent, filth begets filth.  Take a pass on Hibachi until they cleanup their act."}
{"text":"I really tried to like hibachi but sad to say this might be my last time going. The workers were helpful as possible but the food was just not that good this time. When we first arrived the floor was very sticky felt like I was stuck on a glue trap. We then proceeded to order our food once the food got to our table it was just okay. My noodles were very over cooked and soft. The noodles were also very salty. The food was indeed hot and fresh just over cooked. I've been here numerous of times and every time was just okay. For the price your better off eating at wasabi or Benihana. Also they charge a 18% gratuity which is very expensive for this place. Sad to say I will not be back here there are better options out ther for the price. Once again the workers are not bad and very happy just the food quality was not the best."}
{"text":"Terrible about sums it up. I will NEVER visit the Mayfield location again. The place looks dirty and dark. The waitress moved so slow and there weren't even many customers. The cook mixed my filet mignon with another customers strip steak and the portions he passed out were no where near equal. The icing on the cake was the 18% gratuity we were charged as a party of 2!!! The waitress wanted to argue and was insistent that my daughter and I were with the 2 other patrons because we ended knowing one another. Food may have been ok but it was overshadowed by the horrible service."}
{"text":"I'm giving this restaurant 3 stars because the food is good but the service leaves a lot to be desired. I ordered what's supposed to be \"express lunch\". When I called they said 10-15 minutes however it was more like 30 minutes! The cashier was just as unpleasant in person as she was on the phone. I was also charged an additional amount for requesting that some of the vegetable choices be omitted, nor did I request an additional amount of the vegetables I did want. 
 I ordered the lunch pick 3- chicken, steak and shrimp. It was served hot and tasted great. I may go back but I'm thinking I'll dine in next time. Hopefully it's a better experience."}
{"text":"Decided to take the kids to their first hibachi experience. This place was the closest, plus they had a Groupon deal... easy decision. I made reservations for 8pm Friday night. Never been here before, kids were excited. When we first walked in, we were greeted by a dirty, pathetic looking fish tank with only a fish or two in it. My daughter agreed and let out a long, drawn out \"uh, yeaaaahhhh\". Not a very impressive first impression to be greeted with. There weren't many people dining in, so we were seated immediately... which I would've expected anyway as we had reservations. We were seated at a table in which already had a couple seated. They asked our server how much longer until the cook comes. The couple told us that they had already finished their soup and salad and had been there a while and were thinking of leaving. But just as they said that, our chef came. I thought the food was pretty good, aside from my steak being a bit over cooked - I asked for medium and it was little on the well done side. The shrimps, scallops, and chicken were all well prepared. I thought the chef could've been a tad more entertaining, but the kids enjoyed the show and their food. Our server was really nice and attentive. Overall, a decent experience... but I'd advise to do something about that aquarium."}
{"text":"This is a very good place to eat except it's kinda dirty and sometimes not sanitary to the customers. Although a great pick for food service is great Ann's it is very good if you want a steak or fish."}
{"text":"Larger seating capacity than it looks like on the outside. Place kinda tucked in the corner. About a mile walk from lodging in the area. Walked in on a Sunday night. Not very busy and took some time to be greeted. All persons were helpful and professional. Ordered hibachi salmon and coworker ordered steak. Generous portions and were attentive to needs. Salmon was one of the better cuts I have had. The glaze a touch caramelized from the grill. Steak may have been slightly overdone as per order but satisfactory. Vegetables were fresh and cooked well. Maybe lay off the broccoli some."}
{"text":"Definitely have had better hibachi. Didn't taste horrible but certainly have had much better. Based on this experience I would go down the road to Wasabi."}
{"text":"As a business traveler in the Midwest I eat at about 100 restaurants yearly.  I have to say I was worried walking into this place in the strip mall area of south cleveland.  But, I was pleasantly amazed!  Sushi (yellowtail) was so fresh and my steak/chix/shrimp habachi was tender, lean, with low oils and completely hit the spot.

Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This place has been open in the recently renovated Alpha Plaza in Highland Heights for a few months now. I have been meaning to try it out because I really enjoy Japanese hibachi restaurants and want to support the businesses in this area.

My immediate review is that I was very disappointed and most likely will not return.  The first impression of the place was not great. handwritten signs on the front door advertising a Mother's day special seemed kind of low class. Then the two high school aged greeters at the door were very immature. There was a very gross floor cleaning machine in the front entry and the girl at the desk was eating Arby's.

When we got to our table our server was named Mei. She was not attentive and it was not a great impression. Because we were waiting so long I checked out the cheesy decor of the place and also visited the restroom which wouldve been a better fit in a dive bar than a steak house.

The service was slow and it took forever to get our refills on our drinks. The onion soup was decent but the salad was not appetizing at all. The ginger dressing had a terrible taste. I usually love the ginger dressing but I couldnt make it thru two bites. 

The saving grace for this place was when our chef showed up. I wish i could've caught his name because he deserves special mention. He put on a great show and his food tasted great! I ordered the New York strip steak medium-rare and he cooked it perfectly. The fried rice was delicious. My wife ordered the teriyaki chicken and she did not like it. The sauce wasn't good in her opinion.

So overall our check came to $37.60 for the teriyaki chicken, steak, two fried rices. We didn't order any drink other than water. 

Unfortunately, i feel bad rating this place poorly, but they definetly need to make some improvements to be charging the prices they are."}
{"text":"I have it three stars bc the service was kind of crappy and the food was not hot. I really don't know if I'll come back to this place. 

The waitress was ok in the beginning but as the meal progressed she got lazy. I sat in the sushi bar area bc I was alone which wasn't a problem. 

I ordered the New York strip and scallops which was a combo. The salad and soup came out and the lettuce was discolored and the onions were tough. 

My entree arrived pretty fast but she never brought any sauce that would normally be offered when you sit at the large cooking/hibachi table (Idk the real name). Instead she stood there talking to a guy who ordered take out about phone cases. About 15 minutes later she finally remembered I existed and asked if everything was ok? I told her I never received sauce and asked for a box and sauce. 

She did, finally, bring me both sauces and her lack of service was reflected in the gratuity. \"Good service prompts good reward.\""}
{"text":"I am not one to write a bad review but I have never had an experience like I have with this place. They tell you to leave your reservation on the answering machine.. so I did. I called back at 5 to make sure they received it they told me they are really busy tonight and 7 o'clock is not avaliable. So I asked for earliest reservation and they gave me 8 oclock. I came in at 8 only to hear that my reservation is running 45 minutes behind! My group and I tried to make the best of it ordered a few drinks while we waited and listened to the manager act completely unprofessional when another employee said to her \"there are customers who would like to speak to you\", she replied \" if they want to speak to the manager they can come to the bar, I don't have time for that\". I was appalled!! We did not want to stay at that point but our options were limited because we had made plans for after dinner (that we ran late for). We were the only ones who tipped the chef at the table even though our portions were completely off compared than the people we sat with. I called to speak to a manager today about my experience and all I got was \"okay... I heard your story, is that it?\". That is exactly why I am leaving this review. I am absolutely livid right now. That is no way to run a business I wouldn't waste my time or money here!!"}
{"text":"Good service, funny cook and great food. Plus you get a ton for your money. I got the combo deal, new york steak and bourbon chicken, which comes with soup, mixed vegetables, white rice, 2 shrimp and salad on the side, all for only $20!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a whim when an emergency sushi craving hit me after a meeting in Independence. I used Yelp--of course--to track down the nearest, non-crappy sushi restaurant and it turns out it was right across the street. Well, alrighty then! 

Hidden in the corner of a stripmall, the outside didn't look promising, but the inside was clean and very nice. I ordered sushi take out and did not try any hibachi, so please keep that in mind. 

With that being said, the sushi was pretty good! Not my favorite by any means, but I stuck with a safer order for my first time here. They didn't disappoint. The spicy tuna rolls featured very large hunks of tender tuna with a light, very spicy mayo inside. It was much better than the other spicy tuna rolls I've had that hack up the meat of the tuna into a mayo... If it's more like a blend, I'm not down. These had big hunks of fresh tuna which made me very happy. I also ordered one California Roll just to see how they did with one of the simplest rolls. This one I wasn't a fan of--but I think it was just because the spicy tuna was so.much.better. The seaweed on both rolls blended with all the flavors and wasn't chewy. The rice seemed just fine. I will admit, I don't really know the difference between a lot of different rices. I can tell if it's sticky vs. jasmine vs. brown vs. white rice --but that's about it. This seemed pretty fresh and was sticky enough to hold the rolls together even after dunking in wasabi-laden soy sauce. 

The wait was about 10 minutes for 3 rolls--so I know they were making them fresh. I probably wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but in a pinch--they definitely cured my sushi craving."}
{"text":"Definitely a favorite hibachi when I am in Mentor.  The food is good and the staff is fun.  We always have a great time."}
{"text":"Used to frequent the place but stopped for some reason, first time back and was extremely disappointed, food was good, service was good but the place was not very clean, really took a downward trend, maybe the owners have too much on their plate."}
{"text":"3.5 stars = nice hibachi tricks, good selection. not too pricey. chef at the next table could fling shrimp from 10 feet away into the diner's mouths and made most of the targets! if you have not been to hibachi before, they cook the food in front of you, to order, whilst performing various culinary tricks. entertainment while you wait.

atmosphere/decor is a little lacking, and it does take a while as you wait for other people to fill up your table. but the huge fireball makes it worth the wait.

one thing - some of the patrons were tipping the chefs, and they had a tip jar. i haven't seen this as other hibachi restaurants so i don't know if it's the norm here as well. not everyone tipped the chef."}
{"text":"Have been here for lunch and for dinner as well.  The food is pretty good, not fantastic but not bad.  While I am not a huge fan of the whole Hibachi show of cooking your food in front of you, the quick lunch is nice.

Quick lunch is basically the Hibachi food without the show and cooking in front of you.   Given the lack of other Oriental lunch options in the area, will probably be back."}
{"text":"Went here with some co-workers to celebrate the holidays and had a pretty good experience! They don't do hibachi in front of you on Mondays which we did not know, but since there was a large enough group the restaurant made an exception and set us up with a funny chef. Another thing that makes this place awesome is that they let me skip out on the rice and instead get more vegetables since I am trying to eat healthier. 

Overall, we all thought the food was tasty and will make this place our go-to for special work lunch outings."}
{"text":"I really like this place. It's my restaurant of choice when traveling to this area. I can always try something different and you can order hibachi from the bar which is awesome. The staff is friendly and accommodating. I really go in for both the people and the food. Will continue to frequent this place as long as I'm in town! The Japanese nachos are my favorite appetizer (I live dip and it reminds me of crab/tuna dip in a chip) the salmon sashimi is always delicious and the filet mignon hibachi was delicious."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the meals all three times we have been there. The filet and shrimp have always been seasoned well and quite delicious. I disagree that the ginger dressing on the salad is lousy- though different from other restaurants, the yum yum dressing is very good.   Everyone has different tastes and this should be considered. I do agree that the dirty fish tank at the front of the restaurant needs to be addressed by the management. The whole from of the restaurant needs a little TLC - but the hibachi tables and food is quite good."}
{"text":"I called in and order before leaving work so that I could just grab it and go. It was just barely okay, and it filled my tummy. That is pretty much what I was looking for seeing as how this isn't really a sushi place. In fact, I guess I really don't recommend the sushi at all. It was pretty bad. Their hibachi is much better.

On hibachi's website they advertise that Wednesday and Sunday are 'buy-one-get-one-half-off sushi days' yet when I asked the hostess why I was overcharged she told me the deal only applies to dine-in customers. Hibachi fails to mention that on their website or on their menu.

This place is dirty.

If you can find a different hibachi style-restaurant that is just slightly further then I would go there. Definitely if you want sushi do not eat here."}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised by the level of service at Hibachi.  The waitress provided attentive, excellent service on par with some of the best we've had.   The grill chef was cleanly amusing and interacted with our kids extensively.     

We ordered New York Strip, Shrimp and Pineapple Chicken entrees and everyone loved them.  The spicy salad dressing was a favorite with a bite missing from some we've tried at other Hibachi restaurants.

Best of all, my youngest had New York Strip from the kids menu for only $3.95 as all kids' meals are only $3.95 on Sundays."}
{"text":"This place is very average in all respects. Plusses- the do not skimp on the proteins and vegetables.
Negatives - salad dressing is mayo, no garlic, pepper, and bland fried rice.  Only 2 eggs for 8 orders of fried rice. The show was pretty borring."}
{"text":"My current favorite hibatchi. I usually stuck with the fancy chain ones. This gem is in a plaza and the good and service was great."}
{"text":"The food was okay. There's definitely better options if you are looking for hibachi though. The place was totally empty except us and two other people seated at our grill. The onion soup had a strange taste, as did the fountain drink. The grill chef was very friendly and nice but didn't do any of the extra tricks you expect to see at a hibachi place. They upcharge for everything. Your meal automatically comes with white rice, if you want noodles it can be substituted for 3 dollars. I've never been to a hibachi place that didn't offer rice and noodles automatically. It's a good starter hibachi place, but look for better places if possible!"}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant for the first time today and we're blown away!  The service was spectacular, making sure we always had beverages, our soup and salad were brought out quickly, and she was extremely knowledgeable about the menu.  The chef was remarkable with the best show we had ever seen at any hibachi steakhouse, and we have visited over 50 of them around the country through the years.  The food was prepared perfectly, and the flavors were delicious.  I can't recommend this restaurant enough.  I will be back regularly for sure."}
{"text":"I went here with my Dad, during my annual holiday trip home to Ohio. They sat us at a cook-top with two other couples. I ordered the shrimp hibachi dinner, and my Dad ordered the sushi. I thought both the food and the drinks were good, but I am only giving this place 4 stars due to the fact that I got a shrimp thrown at me. I guess I was supposed to catch it in my mouth, but when the chef yells something undecipherable and then throws a shrimp at you, you are not sure how to react. I was glad I was wearing a sweat shirt and not something nice! The other girl at our table ducked as the shrimp was thrown at her. I think it ended up in her hair. BEWARE: Shrimps are thrown!"}
{"text":"The worst service EVER! Lackadaisical high school hostesses tell us there's a 10-minute wait and we can sit in the bar area. Fine, but there is another entirely empty dining room, and all we want = sushi and tiki drinks (which I remember were great the last time I ate here), not a hibachi table, so I let her know. She seats us in the empty room with two sushi menus that appear to have last been printed on a mimeograph in the 1980s. We had only just sat down when our server arrived and asked about drinks. I told him we'd only just been seated and hadn't had a chance to look at the menu yet, but we'd start with water, please. 

What does he do? He tries to takes the drink menu OUT OF MY HAND. Oh HELL NO. Again, I tell him we haven't had a chance to look yet, and he tries to open the drink menu. Ok, seriously? What the hell. Go get us some water and we'll tell you what we want when you come back. 

Incredibly...nay, epically awful service. I wasn't paying premium prices for that. We left. 

It's a shame. This place used to be good. I wish I could give it zero stars but no such luck."}
{"text":"Don't go to this place! They have horrible foods they are expensive as hell! The Groupon is a freaking waste. We waited so long for someone to take out drink orders my husband had to go to the bar to get me a drink! It's just so much wrong with this place! I'm now going to the better business bureau..."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a no star I would! Where do I begin our server was great but the service was so slow! How is the kitchen backed up when they cook in front of you? We ordered appetizers and our food was cooked before they even came so we just told the server we didn't want them. Next there is no way on the world you have your chicken, steak on the same tray as your seafood especially for people who don't eat that red meat. Next thing, after we were done and got our bill you meant to tell me 18% gratuity for 1 person is right? Absolutely not you can't tell me what to tip my server and you add to my bill without my consent. Who's to say he/she was worth 18%? Never ever again I'll stick to Wasabi!"}
{"text":"Wouldn't recommend going here if you have any allergy or dietary preference. Just left after a very bad experience. I have a severe shellfish allergy which we alerted the waiter to when we came in. We even asked that they not seat anyone else at our table so that we didn't disturb their meal. Everyone at my table agreed not to have the shrimp that is included with the meal. Stressed this multiple times. The chef comes out and prepares the rice and vegetables. Then the steak. When preparing the chicken he then reveals a covered bowl of shrimp. I decline to eat my chicken because it's now been cooked next to the shrimp. Not the chef's fault because the waiter didn't inform him there was to be NONE at the table. None the less, I can't eat anything further. The meal goes on and the chef proceeds to try and do a trick and throws a shrimp into my plate. My meal is completely ruined. Not only do they leave the meal on my bill for me to pay for but tack on 18% gratuity. Typically I would leave 20% and did in fact rip the chef separately, but in this case, I certainly would not have left that tip. I more then understand mistakes happen, but to jeopardize the health of a customer and then punish the chef who wasn't informed is not the type of restaurant I would ever wish to frequent. Last trip here."}
{"text":"Chef was very entertaining and paid a little extra attention to my daughter. $5 mai tai on Sunday and it went down nice and smooth!! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Good food and hibachi chef was very entertaining.  They gave me 7 dollars off bill for birthday even though it was a few days past.  A few issues with clean plates and cups."}
{"text":"Yummy cucumber avocado rolls for the non-meat eaters of the world! Great prices as well!  I've never sat in the restaurant to eat, which is the only reason this place does not have 5 stars."}
{"text":"Food was cold soup was cold sushi was above room temperature I think they got there temps all wrong here the things that are supposed be cold are not and vise versa portions are small for the price bad ventilation and smells like fish sauce  !!!!÷"}
{"text":"The most  frustrating thing is for two foreigners with thick accents from different countries to negotiate over the very involved and detailed sushi menu...No offence but I and our waiter were totally lacking the linguistical backbone to lean upon in order to understand each other. He sounded like this bird to me ( all vowels and sighs), I sounded like a very angry hungry bird ( all consonants and attitude)...Suddenly I regretted dropping out of the sign language class in the community college during my first year in America. As a result I got the sushi (not bad at all), and he even got the tip, but seriously they should consider a paper version of the order...just a thought."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this a half of one star. Absolutely terrible. The shrimp had poop in it, rice was served last leaving our other food cold. Just not appetizing. Lost my appetite. We will not be back for a very very long time."}
{"text":"It is not high-end steakhouse place by any means, but the food was still filling and flavorful. The service was decent. Everyone was laid back, which was quaint for the atmosphere.

My only gripe was that the floors felt slippery and a bit sticky. It made for an awkward situation as my guest and I basically slid our way to our chairs, as if we were skiing. 

Overall, if you are looking for the Japanese steakhouse experience, but are not trying to break the bank as much as some of the other high-end steakhouses, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"This business could care less about customers.  On Sunday night I had exactly one take out and they forgot the rice which was half the dinner.  Left me with broth, tiny salad, 6 shrimp and limp veggies for 22.00 with my tip.  called them...tough luck they said we will refund 3.00.  Told them attitude stinks it was their mistake and have owner Benny call me and he did not care enough.  There are far better hibachi style restaurants than this very sad example."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite hibachi in town. Food quality , service and price beat any other competition. I visit this location once a month and have never been disappointed. They have a great sushi menu that was recently updated I try something new every time. The Halloween roll is my favorite. I guess they are working on interior improvements I can't wait to see the whole rest. complete!"}
{"text":"Wow where do I begin. Walked in around 7:30 and there was only one other table with people. First thing we noticed was how it was a time machine to the early 90's. Nothing has been done to this place in years. The lighting was very dim, most likely because they were trying to hide the stains on the walls that we noticed when walking in. We sat down and ordered two cocktails that we immediately sent back. This is the first time I think I have ever sent a drink back to the bar. The ginger beer was flat, and that margarita tasted like limeade. We settled on a bottle of sake since we knew it came in a bottle already. Once our sake came the music stopped, and asked if they could turn it back on. We were told it was from the servers iPhone, and it had died so we would have to wait to hear music until she charged her phone. We couldn't help but laugh. Next, We ordered the shrimp and scallop hibachi dinner. Soup was good, then came the salad. The lettuce was obviously a mix that came pre packaged in a bag. Then they topped it with an orange looking ranch dressing that was warm. Once our chef came to prepare our food, we hoped that it would get better. We were greatly mistaken. The scallops had a fishy taste to them, and were very rubbery. The shrimp honestly wasn't horrible, nor were the vegetables. The rice was thrown on the grill for about two minutes with some soy sauce.  I've been to many hibachi restaurants and have never quite had such a horrible at experience as this one.  I'm never one to complain but this was unacceptable. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Yep I got dinner out on Mother's Day. However it was around 7:45 and I figured we may miss the crowds. We came in right after a huge party. I've been here a few times and this was the busiest I've ever seen it. There were only two other people in the non-hibachi side. 

Started off not great: My hot tea tasted like typical black tea with coffee - gross. Ordered an appetizer and four rolls. My Spicy Tuna showed up first, followed by another roll a few minutes later. After at least 5 minutes, a third roll arrived. We had finished two rolls before the appetizer arrived (for what it's worth, it was the appetizer combo - a crab roll, an egg roll, and two pieces of yakitori). A few minutes after the appetizer we got the last roll. I should note there was no explanation, only after we asked were we told \"a few more minutes\".  Luckily we were sharing rolls (had to ask for plates), which the waitress didn't seem to know - so it seems like it's even more rude to give me my rolls first.

The sushi was good enough but not great at all. The White Tiger was actually kind of gross and didn't stay together well. The Spicy Tuna was good and the Rainbow Roll was the best out of the bunch (but still not the best I've had in Cleveland). However the menu mentioned buy one roll get one half off on Wednesday and Sunday (fried rolls not included), so for a deal I don't need impressive sushi. The appetizer wasn't that great. The chicken was tender but neither of the rolls were very good at all.

The weird order of our food arriving was annoying but not a deal breaker. Another weird thing was the employees hanging out watching tv and eating in the dining area. At any given time there were between two and four employees there. Two of the employees appeared to maybe be off work since they only got up to get refills of the beverages. I was a waitress and a bartender for a while and never allowed to do that (at one place if I wanted to stay after my shift I had to change my shirt). Also, the waitress wasn't terrible but not that great (for example, when I complained about the tea tasting weird she said, \"Well I guess I could make you another pot....\" and when I said no thanks, she started to walk away. Um, can I get another beverage? I got a replacement beverage, but then couldn't find the waitress when I wanted a refill). Again, none of these things are deal breakers - just made for a very weird dining experience.

Our bill came (with the aforementioned deal listed at the bottom) but no 1/2 price rolls. Huh? I inquired because no where was it listed holidays were excluded. The waitress went to check and said today didn't count because it was Mother's Day (maybe they should indicate that holidays aren't included). Sorry but that's a huge downer to me. While I like that this place is not far from where I live, Wasabi is under 2 miles (probably closer to 1) away and has superior service and sushi. I've found that Sushi Rock and Pacific East are better. In the end, minus tip, the total was $72 and completely NOT worth that. At all."}
{"text":"My wife and I went today because we had a Groupon for $20 toward our bill! We were pretty impressed by the food and service. Overall really happy with our visit. 
The chef that prepared our food was hilarious and kept us engaged while he cooked. He made jokes and kept us laughing. Well worth a tip. Make sure you bring cash to tip the chef- or it makes
For an awkward ending. 
Food was awesome- I had the bourbon chicken (amaaaaazing) and the teriyaki chicken. I preferred the bourbon chicken over everything I was served. Veggies were seasoned well and the fried rice was spot on. 
Only negative was the cleanliness of the surrounding Resturant. Felt a little dingy and outdated. Our plates needed to be wiped off again before we could use them.
I would highly suggest going with a large group or as a date and meet some new people. The people we sat with were awesome!"}
{"text":"If I had to review this place solely based on the Hibachi experience I'd probably have given it at least three stars.

The Hibachi grill was pretty standard. The food was OK, not great, and the chef did a nice job with the grill entertainment.

Aside from that, this place is awful.

The first thing I noticed was how empty it was at 6:30 p.m. on a Thursday. That should have been my first clue. Then, I couldn't help but  notice how dirty the place was overall. My feet were sticking to the floor as I walked to our table and once I sat down my shoes were almost glued to the floor. 

Our server was pretty bad...and that's being kind. 

My 13-year old son ordered a California roll for dinner. My 10, soon to be 11-year old daughter ordered the Pokemon (chicken/shrimp Hibachi). My wife had the pineapple chicken hibachi and I had a chicken stir fry hibachi.

Again, the Hibachi was fine. The egg rolls we ordered could have been frozen and microwaved and the soup was pretty gross.

I had planned to be very stingy on my tip due to our server's lack of attention to our table. With no other tables--I'm not exaggerating, we were the only group in the hibachi side of the restaurant--our server should have checked on us, at least to refill our drinks.

I was shocked when I received the bill to see 18-percent gratuity already added, which pushed our dinner total for four (two adults and two kids) to $91.50. 

Seriously? 18-percent gratuity? No wonder our server seemed careless. He was. He already was getting 18-percent, why work harder?

Our purpose for visiting the Hibachi was to celebrate my daughter's birthday. It was her choice. She wanted the sparkler cake dessert. Unfortunately, this Hibachi didn't have it. They did have a cheesecake my kids were excited about, but apparently the restaurant was out. They settled for sherbert, which might have been in the freezer since the day the place opened. At least they ate the whipped cream.

We won't be back and I don't recommend this place to anyone else."}
{"text":"A co-worker and I ate there after being disappointed w Wasabi down the street earlier in the week. Habachi's portions are bigger than Wasabi, and in my opinion the food was better, too. I enjoyed it, and, with it being down the street from my job I will be back. I am a huge sushi fan, so I am happy to endorse this restaurant over Wasabi in Independence"}
{"text":"Got lunch from this place today with my colleague. We called and placed a pick up order. We work relatively close so we walked over. The staff was friendly and efficient both on the phone and in the restaurant. I ordered the 3 roll lunch special with salad. The price was great at $13 but the quality was definitely lacking. I ordered the spicy salmon, spicy tuna, and the yellowtail rolls. The rolls had so much rice and were half falling apart. I should have asked for more soy sauce cause it would have masked the flavors and made it taste better. I didn't eat it all and it was a little bit of a struggle to get down what l did. I didn't much care for the salad dressing either. I prefer a ginger dressing. Don't think I will be ordering the sushi again maybe next time if my friend wants to go again I will try the hibachi because that did smell pretty good while I was there."}
{"text":"Dirty....Dirty ..... Dirty
If you drop silverware or chop sticks... the 5 second rule doesn't apply. 
The floor was greasy, chairs kept sliding all over the place. Most of the laminate on the table tops around the hibachi grills were all bubbled and scorched and coming apart around the grill from the heat. Our table area felt as it was just wiped with a rag dipped in water and just wiped, the chairs had a coating of grease on them, almost the texture on the underside of my grease hood at home after I cook bacon.

Mens bathroom was filthy, looked as though it had not been cleaned in 4 days.
Staff had not changed paper towels and just left the roll on the sink.

Most of the employees are either fresh out of High school or just starting college, so I guess that would explain why this place probably hasn't gotten a good attentive cleaning. Spend more time doing your job than trying to look fashionable.

** Have some pride people .... CLEAN THIS PLACE!! ***

Bait and switch when it came to specials or coupons.

I ordered a bottle of cold sake (not a cafe of the warm house sake) and was missing a shot or 2 from the bottle. I mentioned it to waitress and she said thats the way it came?!? Really?? My first bottle was filled to the top of the neck, just like every other beer/sake bottle I ever bought.

Hibachi chef was more interested in rushing our group of 8 to get to an entire group of college girls. Usual routine was totally skipped. Cook, shrimp toss and  leave. Thanks dude for a crappy show!! 

If its down and dirty, overpriced hibachi with a lousy show that suits your pallet, and sake bombs is your idea of a good time, you've come to the right place.

On a brighter note, service from our waitress was good and pleasant. She just needs to recognize when the bartender is pinching my sake from a pre-filled bottle.

Food Quality was typical, nothing ecstatic.

Would I return... NO - I'd drive 1/2 further to a cleaner restaurant. and get a real hibachi show."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get hibatchi! The food is always great! And the portions are huge! My favorite drink is the mango daiquiri. 

My friend and I went here for dinner last night and Devin was our chef. I've had him a few times before and he is always nice, funny, and always does a great job preparing an amazing meal! 

One thing I was upset about was the fact that we had a coupon for \"buy one entree get one free.\" Yes, this sounded too good to be true and it was. Unfortunately, our server informed us that the company that printed the coupons made a mistake. They informed us that all they could do was offer $10 off of our meal. Working in the service industry I feel that the management should have honored it. Instead she came over and told me there was nothing she could do and was of no help, and proceeded to tell me I could call the hotline of the company who created the coupon for them to tell me that it was their mistake not the restaurants.
I will Definitely be back for dinner soon, but I hope they fix this issue soon!"}
{"text":"Been dining here for years.  I think the food is amazing!  I always get the steak shrimp & scallops!  They also offer some tiki style cocktails!  Always friendly service they never miss a beat"}
{"text":"Well i have never given 1 star before but here we go.  My girlfriend and I decided to try this habachi place having just moved into the area.   When we approached the entrance we noticed half of the electric sign was out and what appeared to be a bird nest, probably a hawk or eagle from the size of it, was hanging from between the letters.  Little did we know this was a portent of things to come.  Upon entering we were greeted not with the buttery smell of clean hibachi but by a fetid scent that hung just on the edge of recognition.  While walking to our chairs we noticed the area appeared to be under construction with missing wall paneling and removed trim with dried glue all along the wall.  However the telltale signs of a project in the works we absent as evident by the greasy coating on every surface.  When we approached the hibachi grill the table around it looked like a formica laminate fresh from the 80's.  With areas so worn the green tile color was rubbed off to a dull brown showing the layer underneath.  The service was terrible and half hearted and when asked what the server would recommend to first timers, in a dead eye monotone she said its all good.  I ordered the iced green tea, my girlfriend ordered the rootbeer.  Tea was okay, rootbeer tasted like syrup, so did the second one.  My girlfriend asked for water instead.  Then we both ordered the geisha combo which is filet, shrimp, teriyaki chicken with veggies and rice.  I ordered miso soup instead of onion.  We both ordered fried rice instead steamed.  The miso soup had a handful chives and the seaweed was thick and chewy.  It reminded me of trying to   chew through a cardboard box.  After a few spoonfuls I gave up.  The filet was a redish brown color before cooking which looked like it was either about to turn bad or had been frozen and then thawed out.  The chicken was whitish and looked like it had been frozen as well.  The shrimp was okay but bland if there was a okay portion it would have to be the shrimp.  I dont understand why the steak and chicken were so low quality as right nextdoor is a giant eagle with a full butcher shop to fresh cut meat.  The veggies were wilted and brown, the salad had brown cabbage and yellow brown lettuce.   The chicken was chewy and flavorless.  The steak was bland, the veggies tasted of oil, the celery looked like the worm in a tequila bottle.   The restaurant was empty and our waitress only came by twice.  The bus boy came by at least 8 times and refilled my tea once at the end of the meal.  All in all the best use for this place is to increase the sales for the china house carry out two doors down.  If you hate someone buy them a gift certificate for this habachi."}
{"text":"They did not honor our reservation when we came. They said it was busy and we had to wait in line with walk ins and the wait would be at least 45mins. The manager on duty (Stephanie) was very rude. Ive never seen worse customer service in my life.  I will never come to this restaurant again. I will also write other reviews regarding the experiences i had here on this day."}
{"text":"The chef and food were delicious. I am a sucker for the yum yum sauce and I was truly craving it (and I was visiting from out of town). The service: snails pace. It wasn't the weekend but it was dinner time and to only have one person trying to take care of 4-5 tables is unacceptable. I was about to take a nap waiting on water and a box!"}
{"text":"Not sure what happened to this place but the sushi was horrible tonight. We are so disappointed in this place. Just horrible!!! Go somewhere else!!"}
{"text":"Service was very slow tonight.  Normally This place is good and we love it. Drinks took about 30 mins. The cook didn't entertain very much. We had to ask for refills.  Kinda disappointed.  This used to be a very entertaining place to go."}
{"text":"I'm just not used to a family style restaurant that is not kid friendly. No high chairs, no milk, long waits for nothing.  The show was good, the chefs were good.  Management look at the reviews about the cleanliness, because the restrooms were horrendous.  This alone may keep me from returning."}
{"text":"I'm only giving one star because the miso soup was good. To start it off, the place was empty when my boyfriend and I arrived. That should have been the first indicator that our experience was going to be disappointing. 
The dressing on the salad was literally mayonnaise. The yum yum sauce tasted pretty mayo-y too, but the boyfriend didn't seem to mind it too much. The hibachi was nice and efficient, we were the only people there though.  After a few bites of my meal I notice a hair so naturally I pulled it out. I'm normally not one to complain if I'm unsatisfied but I draw the line at hair. When I told our server she offered a new plate of rice, which I refused and then she took my plate away. When she returned she told us she took $2 off the bill for the rice...and then she said 'none of us have long hair, that's not our hair'.  Keep in mind before I said anything about it I made sure it wasn't my hair...I have RED,CURLY hair. The hair I found was brown and about 5 inches long. Oh yes, every employee we encountered besides the man who grilled our food had long hair. The guy who prebussed our soup/salad dishes had his hair in a ponytail. Don't try to make the guest look at fault, especially in this situation. I understand hair falls out, but I don't want it in my overpriced food. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"I'm pretty shocked at these reviews as well! Used to go to this place as often as possible. Yum yum sauce is amazing! My Go To was always the Hibachi Combo (filet & shrimp) & it was always cooked to perfection and delicious! PLUS, I always had leftovers! 

The staff was accommodating & friendly. There was a wait ONCE there from what I remember. The staff also remembered me every time I was there! Fabulous place! Check it out!"}
{"text":"Dinner out on Mother's Day was great! I expected a longer wait due to the holiday but was seated promptly and great service continued! The chefs know how to entertain and most importantly cook delicious food! I enjoyed the filet and salmon and family members loved the chicken and shrimp.  The server recommended a drink special and I was not disappointed. Definitely worth a visit and will return many times! My new favorite Japanese steakhouse!"}
{"text":"I was not expecting good things based on the other Yelp reviews of Hibachi, but I was pleasantly surprised.  The atmosphere at Hibachi is very nice and they were easily able to accommodate our larger group of 20 people.  The service was very good and they made sure we were taken care of.  I cannot comment on the hibachi as I opted for sushi, but the sushi was fresh and delicious.  The seaweed salad was also very cold and good.

My dining mates enjoyed the hibachi and the chef made it entertaining.  The portions were very large and everyone left full and happy.  I have no complaints about my experience at Hibachi!"}
{"text":"We had a bit of a wait, but we had a wonderful dinner.  They've raised their prices considerably since out last time here. 
We had a large party, and ordered hibachi shrimp, scallops, filet, chicken and lobster.
The cook was cool and the children were entertained. The quality of food was good.
 Interior is looking a little dated, but the staff is friendly and our waitress really went out of her way to make sure the kids had what they needed.  A solid three stars."}
{"text":"Food was horrible and very over priced. Only reason for 2 stars is the staff was very friendly and quick. I will never go back."}
{"text":"Coming to hibachi for our family has been a tradition for over 15 years.   Now that they've moved to Andre building, it enhances the experience even more. Not only are the servers attentive, but the chefs make a conscious effort to make the experience interesting, to say the least. I highly recommend coming to this location for any special occasion."}
{"text":"The entrance Windows are filthy I should of stopped there. The entire place is disgusting. Looks like everything wiped down with greasy rags. Bar glasses hanging filthy, umbrella hanging cobwebs, restroom smelled so bad due to kotec dispensers overflowing yuk. Don't go here"}
{"text":"My wife and I were doing some shopping nearby, so we decided to give Hibachi a try. It's located in a recently renovated strip along Alpha Drive, so i expected the inside to look relatively new and modern.

First impression wasn't the greatest. A large dirty fishtank greets you upon entering. While waiting (10 minutes) for a table, I was finally able to locate the sole fish still living in the filth. Hand-drawn poster boards line the walls of the hostess area.

The young hostess apologized for the wait, and we were finally shown to a table. The restaurant is fairly large, with about 10 hibachi tables in back, with a few traditional tables and a bar up front. The decor inside is very plain, and it was freezing at our table. Not to mention that the floor under my feet was sticky.  Once we were seated, we proceeded to wait at least another 10 minutes before a server showed up to take our drink orders. To break up the monotony, I decided to use the men's room. The best thing I can say about that experience was there was actually paper towels and soap. The urinals were dirty, and the floor was sticky as well. At this point I had half a mind to get up and leave -- if we weren't so hungry from waiting so long, we probably would have. 

Our meals were served with the standard onion soup and salad with ginger dressing that every hibachi joint serves. This was by far the worst ginger dressing I've had at a japanese restaurant. It tasted more like thousand island laced with horseradish. If I wasn't so famished I probably wouldn't have eaten it.

Luckily for all involved, the chef that showed up to cook our food was very friendly and talented. The food was pretty good, on par with hibachi fare from other local establishments I've had. The menu has a decent selection of meat combinations. I had strip steak and swordfish, which was excellent.

Bottom line: decent value, but the sub-par ambiance and spotty service knocks Hibachi steakhouse out of contention for my money. I would rather spend an extra $5-$10 and dine at Wasabi or Benihana. We will not be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Got seated last night with our party of 4. Not one server came to our table for 15 minutes. We actually had to get up and walk to the bar to get outlet pylon drinks. Ridiculous! FINALLY she came, no apology given for the long wait and immediately took the order. The \"chef\" also took too much time in getting to our table. 
Where I think the big issue is, when the table is full and people order the same entrees, why do some of the people get more food than others that ordered the same thing. But pay the same price. Even it out
People! To us, the Place has the best hibachi but last night was a doozy! Thank god we hAd great company to get use thru it."}
{"text":"Found a Groupon for hibachi Japan- absolutely fun time. The food was delicious and fresh and great entertainment from the chef. I tried the \"love potion\" alcoholic drink and it was amazing as well. Nothing bad to say about my experience!"}
{"text":"We went there for my friends birthday yesterday. I totally felt like we were in \"Seinfeld\" episode with the Chinese restaurant. We had reservation but it took them 20 minutes to notice us, another 20 minutes we were sitting with nobody approaching up for anything... we were sitting between the kitchen and the bathroom with the smell of the bleach and miso mixed together and then when finally had the chef cook for us he pointed out that the exhaust is not working... in hibachi restaurant ????
Do you think I cared what I ate after all?
Thumbs down:("}
{"text":"I don't like that they do not have hibachi for lunch on Monday or Tuesday. Stephanie T. reached out and told me that this is because customers have told them that they want to get in and out in these days. However, they do offer Hibachi during lunch hours the other days of the week. 
I would like the option. If I'm in a rush, I would not sit in the Hibachi area. This is the reason I go to a \"hibachi\" restaurant. I personally like \"the show\". If they were to offer this daily? I would surely return. 

Thanks Stephanie T. for reaching out. Love when businesses show they care!"}
{"text":"I went there on Monday the 22nd. I was served by perhaps one of the rudest waitresses. She didn't even wear the uniform because I guess she couldn't be bothered.

 She were three couples at the table. All of us ordered appetizers of sushi. The waitress didn't realize did the sushi chef was it in that day. When she came back to take new appetizer orders she only asked one couple at the table if they would like anything else. My wife and I had ordered lobster and worried if you leave the most expensive ticket on the table even though we were going for the birthday special which took a whole 15 dollars off of a $50 ticket.

Even though my parents or the second couple at the table intentionally stop the waitress from walking away she still wouldn't turn to look at me and my wife to take new order appetizers.

When I got the check she had already added in an 18% gratuity. So I guess she felt covered that she didn't have to provide proper service. when I asked her about it she told me that because of the birthday special they were automatically adding the gratuity. I was tempted to call over the manager and remove the birthday special just so I can't deny her the tip for her bad service.

The performance of the cooking was okay I've seen better. And the lobster was drowned in so much sauce I could barely taste it. Would not recommend!"}
{"text":"Quite possibly the worst hibachi experience in my life,the menu was very dirty that should have been my first warning dirty silverware had fillet and lobster took about35-45 minuets and there were only 3 other tables rubbery lobster over cooked fillet poor service at the bar and we were the only one sitting there.will not return"}
{"text":"The food is good for the price. It is a huge place with lots of tables. I would say the yum yum sauce here only qualifies as yum and the salad dressing cannot touch the ginger dressing of Benihana. But it is fun and they offer coupons."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a nice meal on Sunday at 2:30 P.M. with the family. My mom and  son were so excited about going to Hibachi for the 1st time and seeing the cool show put on by the chef. 
It was very amusing and entertaining.
The pineapple chicken is truly delicious as is the ribeye steak. We also really enjoyed the veggies and noodles. The portions are very generous and the food is very high quality.
We had a groupon, but overall the cost was a bit high, but it was a splurge.  The staff was attentive to our needs and the chef was a delight. I'd go back again and try some other delicious foods there.  Overall it was a very enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"I went to the hibachi restaurant with my mom just for a bit of something different.

Our chef, CJ was awesome.

My only complaint was that the waitress got my side dish wrong (noodles) and then the chef had to slim down on the portion because he needed to split it 3 ways instead of 2.

But overall as I rated above a fun time and great food."}
{"text":"You guys have to clean this place better . Floors and carpet areas are horrendous , the portions and food when we were there was great but please clean it up you could have a great place if more care is taken . Your food is only as good as how clean the place is ...."}
{"text":"Went there last night. Sat down & waited 15 minutes for server. Was told there was only one server on. They didn't care that there was more than one table that had not even been approached by anyone. We decided to leave. The womens restroom was extremely dirty. Plates were also dirty. Everything was sticky. Will not return."}
{"text":"Is it the best Hibachi I've ever had? Definitely not. Is it tasty and reasonably priced? Definitely so. Does management need a little adjusting? Probably.

We stopped in on a busy Friday night, and we were promptly seated at a grill with two other couples. We only waited a few minutes for our server to appear; after grabbing our orders, soup and salad arrived within one minute. The service was really the winning point of the night. Our server was attentive, refilled our drinks, and took our plates at the right time. I can't say how many times I've been at a hibachi and I still have empty soup/salad dishes taking up space as the chefs fling around the food. The service was A+ and they even seemed severely understaffed.

The quality of the meats was great; everything tasted very fresh. This place offers mako shark, which is pretty cool. Their menu is really expansive for being such a small space. I ordered teriyaki chicken, and my SO ordered a steak/shark combo. The dinners came with vegetables and as much sauce as you could handle; the chef just kept pouring it out. Everything tasted great except for the fried rice. I think the chef put it the grill way too early in the cooking process; it was crunchy instead of fluffy.

One of the drawbacks is they seem to want to squeeze every ounce of money out of their patrons. I've never seen a Hibachi restaurant that charges extra for fried rice. Here, it's $2 per person. We received a Groupon as a gift, and that's how we discovered this place. However, we were told before paying that since we were using a Groupon, we were automatically charged gratuity. This was not explained to any other patrons at our table, so I can only assume they were free to leave their own tip. Honestly, I was a bit offended. That exchange made me feel the management thought of couponers negatively, and left my SO and I with a bad taste in our mouths after dinner. God forbid Grouponers be educated enough to tip properly."}
{"text":"If you are going to try this place remember that they cook your food at your table. It's interactive and prepare to have a shrimp tossed at you.  Don't come here expecting a quiet calm dinner. Don't come here and complain you smell like food afterwards. ..I warned you.

Now that you know the type of mindset you need going into this place let's get to brass tax...

I think the food is above average. Some people rave about the steak but to me it's good not great.  However there is so much variety that everyone will love something here.

Cost is high, portions are large...very large.  They put on a great show at your table. If anyone complains about the cost they are a cheap ass. When you consider everything you get when you go here the cost is going to be higher than Applebee's. 

Don't be scared about negative reviews. If you like hibachi type places this is a good one to try.  Some people expect everything to be perfect and cheap. Some people don't know they cook food at your table and that means you will smell like food leaving this place.  That's not their fault...that's just what happens when you sit at a stove top for an hour. 

Ignore the bad reviews, go check this place out and eat some amazing food. Personally I'd recommend the scallops and filet.

Fire in the hole!"}
{"text":"First of all, it's my friends birthday so we called ahead to notify them we had a large party and we would be using groupon, the said we could but not on Saturday. I.e. We gave advance  so we arrive (party of 16 to 18) and they sent us out until we all arrive, upon arrival, we waited 10 mins with no service, I had to walk to the back to get someone to usher is in (another 10 min wait). Upon sitting we were notified they will only accept 3 groupon, however 12 people purchased it. We tried to explain the situation but the manager won't budge, so we decided to pay what was left, but was dissatisfied with the service. So we paid twice basically.  We were notified we could use the Groupon another day,  but what reason do I have to come back here. I will give out my groupon and I will have the other 17 people share their experience. I always give reason of doubt to business and try to be fair, but the fact we called ahead,  and was still denied is why the review is low"}
{"text":"The one star goes to the food, which wasn't bad. 
Awful service; I mean it! The worst service I've ever received, ever!
It started with the hostess not knowing what to do with all the people who were piled up in the door. We had a reservation. Then the manager or owner came and told her something so she started sorting people to their tables; but it was still a total mess.
We asked to sit for dinner, not hibachi.
Drinks came probably good 15-20 min after we ordered them (we just had a beer and water).
Then we ordered some sushi and some hot food. The sushi came relatively fast but when we asked about the hot food the same manager/owner almost got mad and said: I'm so busy here I didn't have time to go to the kitchen to get it yet. WTF?!!!!!
We never did get our miso soups, which I guess were getting cold in the kitchen, even though we asked for them a couple of times.
Then came the check and there was a mistake on it, of course. I waited for her to come back and pick it up - she never did. I finally went to the bar where she was standing, cleaning glasses and chatting with some customer at the bar. When I said: I'd like to pay now, please? She was like: oh ok... like she was doing me a favor.
I didn't leave any tip; and it takes a lot for me to not leave any tip, cause I used to be a waitress and know how important those are.
Obviously, we will never be back."}
{"text":"The sushi is really good. The hibachi is very expensive and only so-so. The Hawaii roll is my favorite. I wish they still had their half price sushi night."}
{"text":"I've ate here a couple times with my family. The prices are typical of hibachi but the rice and noodles are additional. The restaurant is in the shopping plaza on Lorain near Giant Eagle. The staff has been OK. It's not the best hibachi but it's ok."}
{"text":"I came here last night to just enjoy the night with my husband. It started off great; the server was wonderful, the food was delicious, but my concern lies with the bartender. She was actually doing shots with customers (I'm assuming she knew them considering they went behind the bar at one point), was obviously very drunk, and even better- she was swearing like a sailor. Constantly yelling the \"f\" bomb and then went on to calling the people she was with (pardon my language) fags. This definitely disrupted our peaceful night out, but the Indians won, so it wasn't ruined. It was just so classless and annoying. Food and service was 5 stars though."}
{"text":"Worst hibachi restaurant I have ever been to! It was filthy. Soup was super salty. Salad dressing was so thick in texture. Food was par. Was asked if we wanted rice, friend rice or noodles. Didn't tell us that fried rice is $2 more and noodles are $3 more! Came with a party of 8 for a birthday dinner. Service was horrible too. Our server had an attitude problem and kept messing up our orders. Avoid at all cost. I'm never coming back!"}
{"text":"I had sushi at the bar area. It was overpriced. And the sushi was just ok.

A lot of sushi is just ok. Here is a brief checklist to qualify sushi. I will probably never use it again because I don't eat sushi anymore.

Rice tasted refridgerated? No
Were there sesame seeds? Can't remember.
Did the wasabi and gari look like they were pre-wadded before refridgeration? Can't remember.
Were the chopsticks plastic, good wood, or splintery wood? Can't remember.
Did the soy sauce come in a Kikoman container? Can't remember.
Was there plastic grass separating the sushi from the wasabi and gari? No.
Was the nori crisp? No. It's ok, it never is.
Was there a good vegetarian selection of sushi? I don't think there was.
Did the chef who prepared the sushi interact with you in any way? No, it was brought out to me, I think.
Did the sushi fall apart under reasonable chopstick handling? No."}
{"text":"The worst food I've ever eaten at a hibachi steak house we was over charged and service sucked and the food was awful I guest people go for the drinks because I will never ever eat there again nasty food,  nasty prices, nasty additudes just nasty don't waste your money please.."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb!  Warm cozy atmosphere!  Very interactive, and the food is great!  There has NEVER been a dish I did not like or I had a problem with!  Food is always cooked perfectly as requested.  One of the best Filets I have ever had.  Also they give a great birthday discount ($12 off) either the day before, the day of, or the day after one's birthday.  It is a great deal and great prices.  Always have fun the with Hibachi Chefs!"}
