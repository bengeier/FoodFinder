{"text":"Came here for restaurant week and was so disappointed. Got sat an hour after our reservation and the only reason I am giving it 2 stars is because they did a phenomenal job with trying to make sure we were taken care of. That being said the food was meh.....I have heard the same from a lot of ppl and told myself I would give it a try. The atmosphere is nice but I don't think it's worth the money food wise."}
{"text":"Everything from the atmosphere to servers to appetizers to dinners were absolutely fantastic! It caters to every age group and lifestyle! Reasonable noise level and with 10 year old twins, very \"kid friendly\" for a trendy adult atmosphere. Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Our waitress was lovely, but the wait time was outrageously long. The restaurant had emptied out before our dinner arrived--I think we waited over an hour. The food was not that good... My chicken taco was so dried out that the meat was crunchy and flavorless. This is not our first time waiting forever and then getting so-so food, so I'm finally leaving a review."}
{"text":"Pretty active bar scene on a Wednesday night, the place was packed as was the dining area. 
Ordered the meat loaf...yuck! And this is supposed to be one of their signature dishes. The meatloaf was dry. It was sitting on a bed of very dry mashed potatoes that almost seemed like they were instant and they didn't add enough water. With it were some peas that we're shriveled up.  
At least the drinks were good. And that is the only reason I would go back here."}
{"text":"I hate giving this place a low rating because the food was good and our service was excellent, but my boyfriend and I had a horrible dining experience due to the following:
We decided to try this restaurant on a Sunday. It was crowded, and still early, so there were families nearby. Despite this, a gentleman and what appeared to be a stripper were all over each other next to our table. This was our date night, so watching a girl sit on a guy's lap and make out with the guy next to me was disturbing. I later found out that this guy was an owner, a friend informed me that his name is Mills. 
Not only this but we were seated at one of the banquettes against the wall, where I had to slide into the table to be seated. The purses/bags/random clothing items from the party next to us were spilling into the section where I was sitting, and they did not bother to move them so I could sit. Once again, the party next to us was that of someone who owns part of this restaurant. 

If I wanted to have a date at a strip club, I would do exactly that. I'm all for watching a lap dance, but not on date night where I'm dropping $100+ on a meal, and not in front of families and children. I highly recommend rethinking this business strategy, or at least practicing mild class."}
{"text":"After having read so many positive comments and reviews, I was really disappointed after my experience here. The food was underwhelming and the staff was not very accommodating. Sadly, I don't believe that I'll be returning anytime soon"}
{"text":"The Mushroom Crepe was excellent and an incredible hearty vegetarian dish. Wish there were more places in Charlotte offering such a variety of options of just veggies but this spot is always dependable."}
{"text":"It's my second time at Nan and Byron's and I'm still not impressed. You can imagine my shock when my friends were charged for Parmesan cheese and mayo.  When my friend asked for fresh cracked pepper  on the somewhat bland shrimp pasta the waiter pointed to the pepper on the table.  The waiter told us that the kitchen won't give them a condiment without a ticket so they are forced to charge for it.  

The service was mediocre both times. 

The menu also needs some work.  Everything is fried, has cheese involved or seems unhealthy (a beet burger-but it's fried).  Don't get me wrong, I love fried and I love cheese but there should be a couple healthy options."}
{"text":"Nothing special. I had the crispy beet burger which they forgot to put the cheese on. Ugh. Also, the mashed potatoes were pretty bland. Its a cool little spot with nice interiors, maybe good for drinks - but you're better off going somewhere else in South End when it comes to the food."}
{"text":"This was my third time here. We went for lunch at an off time so it was very quiet in the restaurant. 

They provide a basket of some spicy popcorn while you wait for your food. Yum. Make sure you have some water on hand  if spice gets you. 

This particular visit I went for the salmon soft tacos. They came with more than enough lettuce, tomato, the most delicious guacamole and cheese for days. The flavor on the salmon was perfect and I was more than full as you get three tacos. 

My friend got the turkey club and loved it. 
She also got some salted caramel dessert, which I snuck a bite, and it was ohmygod good. 

I love this place. I love the country chic decor. It's casual and comfy. 

The only issue I had was.. It was dead and our server wasn't the most attentive. She was just standing around talking while we waited for water refills. I'm not one who needs much - but I could see this being an issue if it were busier.  

Overall- I would most definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Went here last night with my girl for dinner. The food was great! we got several dishes and split them so that we could try a bunch of different stuff. Our favorites were the poppers and the meatloaf, but everything was delicious. This is a great local spot with a very unique vibe and design. We will definitely be coming back many times."}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend (who lives out of town) here because I love the atmosphere and I have always been told how great the food was. The service was fine, our waitress was nice and attentive for the most part however the food is what lacked. I ordered the prime bistro steak, it came with mashed potatoes. While the food was just okay, it came out cold and my steak was slightly overdone. I am not a fan of cold mashed potatoes.The drinks were good but I felt very small for the price. I wish I could give this 2 and a half stars because it is a fun place but way too over priced for what you get. 

Favorite thing here is the popcorn! It's a nice touch and delicious so make sure you get it! The oysters are also a great app!"}
{"text":"We are repeated take out diners.  We live close by. Used to love this place but after repeated errors on our meals just find it hard to go back.  Below is a list of issues:

Consistently don't provide the right temperature of burger. They always under cook.  No exaggeration. I am not sure they understand the difference between rare and anything else.

They overcook fries.

Have forgotten to add meat to the tacos!!! Like zero meat.  I have gotten a shell with veggies!

Added cheese to burgers that was not requested.

Forget to add our soft drinks to the order.

The food itself is fine. The service delivery is lacking.  I can't be the only one with these mistakes.

While we catch most of them before we leave, it's not my job. They need a head chef that monitors quality because it is not there. Too many mistakes."}
{"text":"went there for first time earlier in the week for lunch and it was great- enjoyed it so much that I made resv. for my kids and hubby for Sunday Brunch- it was Extremely disappointing- a waste of money-
 flies were landing on food- a lot of it was undercooked and   getting servers to wait on us at the start took 10 min. to get a glass of water and a greeting from someone-
 it was not even busy then. was not worth the 24 bucks per person.
  Nan and Byrons  can do good food, but Sunday brunch is not  when  they. are doing  it..... don't try to do clever \"riffs\" on classic dishes- just please do them well and pay attention to them...."}
{"text":"The most lively restaurant any day of the week in Charlotte! You're guaranteed to have a delicious meal no matter what you order on the menu. I started with a caprese salad, followed by the beet burger, and finished with delicious strawberry shortcake. I thoroughly enjoyed my meal, the service I received, and the atmosphere. Definitely one of the best restaurants in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"We had Easter brunch here this afternoon. First time here. I can't say enough good things. Food and service are tops! Will definitely go again soon."}
{"text":"First visit.  Sat solo at the bar for a quick bite.  So this is more of a snapshot than a review.

The Good:
 - Beautiful!  Love the finishes, lighting, ceiling tiles, just great design.  I'm not a concrete bar fan but this one is even pretty cool.  The entrance is especially awesome!
 - Bar Service was warm, genuine, names being traded, good menu knowledge
 - Popcorn offered is nice
 - Had the shrimp and pasta, shrimp were excellent, pasta a little salty for me but a decent meal

The Bad:
 - The only negative was sitting at the bar the TVs are mounted so high you have to crane your neck in order to watch the game
  

Grabbing a quick bite at the bar is not enough to cast an opinion of the overall food scene.  But I have confidence that Jamie is offering some great meals."}
{"text":"My husband and I are visiting my cousin I'm Charlotte and decided to come here before hitting up some of the local breweries. The food was AMAZING! We had popcorn to start and I had the prosecco mojito which was good but sweet. I ended up ordering the shrimp n grits which was divine. There were plenty of shrimp, not too much grits and the sauce and seasoning was great. Would highly recommend.

The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is because after we got our food we literally didn't see our waitress for the rest of the time. We waited for about 30 minutes which was fine because we were talking and the bartender had to go get our check. Service wasn't the best."}
{"text":"Have to say I was pretty disappointed in the experience. Liked the atmosphere but food was a tad marginal. Service was slow, salad was ok and shrimp dish was so-so. Might give it another chance but I doubt it. Also, several sides to choose but nothing green....what's up with that. Again, pretty disappointing and I would not recommend."}
{"text":"After visiting 5Church and absolutely loving their food, I was fortunate enough to experience Nan and Byrons when it first opened up. Just like it's sister restaurant, Nan and Byrons lives up to it's expectation. The inside decor is gorgeous and makes the restaurant warm and inviting. I typically sit on the bar side, while the other side of the restaurant is better for larger groups or couples looking for a more intimate setting while eating lunch/dinner. There are also TV's on the wall of the bar so it's a great setting for sports or big television events. 

When it comes to their food, I'm obsessed with the French Dip during the day and the Beet Burger at night. Both come with a choice of a side and I usually go for peas and carrots or the Mojito fries. I'm also obsessed with the popcorn that's served as an appetizer (in lieu of the traditional bread and butter.) When I'm not drinking my usual vodka water, I opt for the Nightshade Martini or the Farmhouse Lemonade. Both sweeter vodka drinks that accompany my meals nicely. 

The staff is awesome and they all make every customer feel as if they are welcome. I go to this restaurant probably 3x a week and will continue to do so. :)"}
{"text":"The burger with the martini fries are so yummy and seasoned well. The service was really well and were very accommodating to the large group of people we had come unexpected.  The menu is a little pricey for what it is but they give you what you pay for I think."}
{"text":"If you want to pay a lot for \"just ok food\" go here - they have such great ideas but missing favor - I order a bunch of apps - all sounded amazing but had no taste -also thought drinks were suppose to be good - they are but you don't taste the alcohol - I probably would not go back unless someone else really wanted to go 
I had high hopes and even considered a party bc the place looks cool but food Not memorable"}
{"text":"We went to Nan & Byron's thinking it was a trendy South End restaurant that was bound to have good food since its owners were 5Church. We were fooled from the minute we walked in the door to see a mostly empty space. Not a good thing in the restaurant business. However, there can be off nights. Our disappointment was compounded by a really crappy wine by the glass list and popcorn with Old Bay Seasoning that really wasn't as enticing as it may sound. My Cobb salad was nothing out of the ordinary and my husband can't remember what he ordered as it was so unremarkable. The staff were great. The restaurant is well done, but the food meh!"}
{"text":"We visited here for dinner during restaurant week. We had a great meal and loved the ambience.  We decided to give brunch a try. My husband loved his breakfast burger. I ordered the Huevos Rancheros, which would have been good if it wasn't for the salt!  It was so salty it was inedible. I was extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"Desperately in search of a place to eat on NYE's ...because our evening came to a holt when our plans fell through. 
We were in NoDa at 6:20pm popped up open table and snagged a 6:45pm slot at Nan & Byron's. 
It was said on the phone that this was a birthday dinner, yes the mister has a New Years Day Birthdate.. sucks for him. lol
Anyhow we arrived and we were pleasantly greeted, pretty hostess without the overly fake greeting and smile. :)
Someone shortly came over and addressed the mister by name and presented him with a HAND WRITTEN birthday card that included a 10% off our next visit.
How nice was that?? 
Great touch guys, we were ALL impressed.

The decor is a quirky mix of rustic polished over with modern design with a touch of glam. Loved it. 

Food- we ordered 3 apps, steak and meatloaf amongst our table, 
everyone was pleased with their dishes, we did however send back 2 steaks due to being a little to rare for our taste.
They happily sent them back and came back out as quickly as possible.

The only suggestion I have would be to add some steamed veggies to the Sides menu, although I subbed mine for a salad.

Overall, Nan & Byrons is a great place for comfort food without having to go to a place that smells like a rest home, know what I mean??

I am so pleased at their service on NYE and cant wait to go on a normal evening.
Though this definitely gives us a big push to go to 5 Church asap.

Thanks to the Team at Nan & Byrons."}
{"text":"Management/ owners hold no reservations about screaming at employees in the middle of a busy restaurant. If you find yourself there on a busy night, don't stay too long because they will ask you to get up to make room for \"other diners\". Everyone who works there looks like they hate their lives and I'm sure their \"professional management staff\" has a lot to do with that. The food isn't bad, but you should choose to give your money to a company that treats people like actual people."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the hype is about. The atmosphere of the place is very cool and I wanted to really like the food but it didn't happen. Overall I think the menu is nothing original, it is just falling the pattern of \"this isn't your mom's recipe\" type of thing. 

The service was great and the drink list was good and had interesting options for cocktails. But that's where it ended. 

The roasted chicken was dry and not that much flavor. (Harris Teeter sells better chicken!) The pork shoulder was also extrememly dry and served on a bed of BBQ beans that taste \"fresh from the can\". Tried the apple cobbler desert and it came out barely room temperature and not cooked fully. Guess it needed more time in the microwave. 

Charlotte has a lot more places that offer similar food but done incredibly better than this. I hate to see restaurants that spend tons of money on atmosphere then go cheap when it comes to the food."}
{"text":"Me and my fiancé ate here the other night, during its first week of business. This place was awesome. We were sat by a large open area, the garage door was pulled up and the whole restaurant was open to the outside. It was cool outside but not freezing so we did not complain. The waitress was friendly and knowledgeable and got our drinks out in a timely fashion. 
The restaurant serves popcorn instead of bread, and it is seasoned with cayenne pepper and Sazon, making it have a nice kick to it. 
I ordered the farmhouse burger, which came with a homemade pickle and homemade poblano cheese, It was easily the best burger I've ever had in Charlotte. My fiancé ordered the steak with corn and mac n cheese. He loved it.  For dessert we ordered the brownie with homemade peanut butter ice cream. It was delicious.
All in all we had a great night, and we will definitely be going back. It's worth a trip to check this place out."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I have been here several times and have always had a great meal with great service.  I would certainly eat here again."}
{"text":"Got the Wagyu Flank and it was AMAZING!  A little noisy but we did have two large parties on either side of us.  Will definately be going back."}
{"text":"Such an amazing space...  I wish, wish WISH it were better, they have a fantastic location and the design is fantastic, I love the details.  This was my third attempt and I am finally writing about it.  I kept trying because I want to like it.  This time, I made a huge mistake opting for the $21 buffet, I really do not know what I was thinking.  Why would I want something that is out in the open, everyone that is seated walks right past the uncovered cheese, dips and sweet treats, ick.  The bacon was undercooked and rubbery, the fried chicken was so dry you could barely get it down, the deviled eggs were warm (I am clearly a health nut) and there wasn't a green to be found other than a cheese filled spinach dip and a teeny salad that was positioned next to the seafood offering.  Needless to say, I will not try it again."}
{"text":"Had dinner here for a friend's bday dinner. Atmosphere was nice. Servers were polite yet not very knowledgable about the menu or drinks. The pimento cheese spread was not what we expected. Very disappointed, however the cheese dip served with homemade potato chips was amazing. A must have!!!

Parking is an absolute nightmare. We thought they had valet and come to find out it's only on certain nights. 

One a side note DO NOT SIT IN THE ROOM OFF TO THE SIDE. There is AC and it is extremely uncomfortable. When asked about it. The sever said its always like that. Very poor circulation."}
{"text":"Just went here for Father's Day.  The food was terrific, and the service was excellent!"}
{"text":"Great spot in South End for a week night or weekend dinner. Also a fun bar to sit and enjoy some cocktails at. 

Once you sit, you will get to munch on some spiced popcorn. 

I've had the meatloaf... Twice. It was yummy. 

Services was good and servers were friendly.  

Valet parking (on busy nights)."}
{"text":"Very cool atmosphere. I had the meatloaf and it was pretty amazing. Looking forward to going back and trying something else."}
{"text":"I've seen some of the negative reviews on here but my experience was great. They must have gotten their act together. This was my first time so I had nothing to compare it to.

Great service. Megan was really top notch. Knew the menu front to back and had genuine suggestions to steer you. My group got the pork chops (their signature dish), shrimp and grits, and the beet burger. All were very well made. We also tried the home made Oreos which were awesome.

Good vibe in there. Lots of people. All around really fun night."}
{"text":"I used to LOVE this place, went all of the time, solely for the beet burger. The recipe changed! No more thick beet medallions - the burger is now more deep fried breaking than beets. Disappointing! I haven't been blown away by other menu options. Hoping they go back to the old recipe. 

Hubby likes the burgers a lot, as well as local beer options."}
{"text":"This review is solely based on Sunday brunch: Meh. Made reservations and had to wait while they seated someone who showed up late for their reservations even though I was on time. Service was entirely disinterested in working that day and made it quite apparent. Bloody Mary's premixed and lacked flavor. It's kind of hard to screw up a mimosa but it basically tasted like vaguely fizzy Tang. Every time I went to the buffet LITERALLY EVERYTHING was empty or they were taking the ladles away. Wait what??? Why the sshh are you taking away ladles for no darn reason?? Most food once I could get any was just ok. 
Bathrooms clean. Parking limited. Not sure how this place gets on \"best brunch in Charlotte\" lists..."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, great food and the service is perfect!  Popcorn to get you started and the chicken soup is nothing like grandma's!"}
{"text":"Came for my birthday and it was great, so my sister and I decided to bring my parents for a family dinner. My mom ordered a burger well-done and it came pink the middle and her whole meal was cold. 
I'm gluten-free and ordered tacos with corn tortillas. I told the waitress I was gluten-free while ordering and they still brought flour tortillas. I sent them back and they brought back the same plate - with flour tortillas but they had heated it up. Everyone else was done eating my food came back so I had to eat fast and by myself and they still charged us for the tacos."}
{"text":"We just went for brunch and ordered their eggs benedict and french toast. The french toast was delightful and the only complaint about the eggs benedict was the sausage was more turkey burger than sausage. The kale was a unique touch, but my plate had a bit too much of it. Luckily, it was easy to remove the excess to my liking.

The atmosphere was fine for a Saturday brunch and I really love the fact that they  have only local beers on draft.

Biggest complaint was that our waitress was HORRIBLE. It took her 15 minutes to take our order, and then we never saw her again, except for when she passed over our table every 5 minutes walking to her other two tables. We never had a single refill ofnour drinks, she never checked to see if our  order was correct, never even acknowledged that we were eating there and when I finally flagged her down for my check, all she said was \"sorry\". (In my opinion, if you are overwhelmed with 3 tables, you should find a new career).

We will go back to this place since the menu looks so good, but I can't see this being one of our regular places."}
{"text":"Worst drinks and food that I've had in Charlotte in years. If you love hot drinks and cold food this is your spot!!! The manager did take care of somethings to try to fix what the kitchen had so badly messed up. You would think when a table went so wrong they may not charge you for mustard but nope they charged us. Waitress was very sweet but needs a bit more training. All in all a waist of an evening."}
{"text":"Definitely try the Farmhouse Lemonade, and the smoked pork spring roll!  Both are delicious!  My husband had the seared tuna and I had the Hanger steak and we both enjoyed them.  For dessert, I had the Chocolate torte, he had the banana pudding, and both were delicious!  Looking forward to returning to try more!"}
{"text":"We have been anxiously awaiting the arrival of Nan & Bryon's in Dilworth. We live two blocks away and frequently walk to dine at Lucianos and 300 East. Our first disappointment is being served wine in juice tumblers. For heavens sake, who wants to drink red wine out of juice glass. (On a separate occasion, the GM told a friend of mine if he didn't like the wine glasses, he should order a vodka...I said 'WHAT'?).
Secondly, I am vegetarian, the choices are minimal but ok. I ordered the Portobello entree with two sides. My entree arrived on top of my sides. The flavor of all 3 things was now just ick. While I was away a week ago, my boyfriend revisited with friends and tried a shrimp entree. Still underwhelmed. Now they have rolled out lunch at the same prices as dinner. Personally, I'll give this place 2 more tries but it's unlikely that I'm going to drink wine out of a juice glass. Dilworth has a lot of nice restaurants who are anxious to please."}
{"text":"The menu has changed and some of my favorites have disappeared. They seem to be concentrating on steak which is a bit of a disappointment with Sullivan's so close.  The food was solid and the service good, but not very exciting."}
{"text":"We tried Nan and Byron's tonight for the first time... the service was friendly and efficient.  The food was good...  I stepped away to use the ladies room and that's where the good review ends.  The room is very dark... tissue all over the floor... in the stall that i occupied there was no place to hang or put a handbag except the floor.  Though there is room for more than one sink, there was only one with a very small counter that was soaked.  A line waiting for the sink caused me to be very quick, but the room was too dark to reapply lipstick or comb hair and the counter way to wet to lean over for a closer look.  It never ceases to surprise me that the comfort and cleanliness of the bathroom is overlooked."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Charlotte.  The restaurant has a trendy yet comfortable vibe and I always know I'll leave satisfied.

The spiced popcorn (free before the meal arrives) is a great touch.  My favorite entree is the grilled portobello with an amazing onion hollandaise sauce and a sweet potato and blue cheese gratin (its amazing) plus perfectly-cooked brussel sprouts.  We usually don't get dessert at restaurants, but we always get the house-made oreos at Nan & Byron's."}
{"text":"Used to love this place.  Service was slow and waiters were grumpy.  Popcorn came without the usual seasoning.  Food did not come out warm.  Manager just standing around talking.  Sadly disappointed tonight."}
{"text":"Nan & Byron's closed for a private event, but forgot to adequately block tables available for reservation. I received a confirmation email for a brunch reservation to celebrate my fiancé's birthday....when we arrived, we were told they were closed. To top it off, the hostess did not seem to believe I had a confirmation, until I showed her the email. Very disappointed in the lack of professionalism, and the restaurant's ability to adequately close reservations when hosting private events."}
{"text":"Nan's is my new favorite restaurant in Charlotte. I've eaten here several times I have never been disappointed. My friends and I like to go for dinner and drinks and stay and hang out at the bar after. I have also brought friends from out of town here, and will be bringing my parents when they come to visit. The restaurant is warm and inviting, and the energy is always up no matter what time of day it is. Sometimes it takes a minute to get your table (and yes, you need a weekend dinner res), but once you're seated the service is FAST. I have been to nan's several times and I am still noticing new things about the décor. It is clean and modern but has a lot of rich, interesting touches. From the ceiling to the floors, they did a great job...seriously, look up when you're in there :)

So far I've had the kitchen sink salad, added chicken with the siracha ranch. It was awesome...its not exactly a healthy salad (it has chips on it) but it was delicious & different. I've also had the chicken, got the mashed potatoes and corn as my sides. One of my favorite meals. The appetizers are great - peppadew poppers and train wreck fries are my favorites. My friends are still raving about how good the meatloaf is. 

The drinks are very different - they put a unique twist on classic cocktails. I've tried the Jalapeno margarita, sparkling mojito, farmhouse lemonade, g'night moon, and the refashioned. I like all of them - favorite is the refashioned, and my girlfriends are huge fans of the lemonade and mojito. The margarita has a little kick to it but just enough.

On weekend nights the bar scene is pretty good. A lot of locals from the south end come in and the crowd is casual yet classy. Saturday nights there's a DJ and I've seen a few dance parties breakout...its always a good time. 

Overall, I love this place, and I'm excited for the warm weather - looking forward to enjoying drinks and food out on the patio. Glad the south end got such a wonderful new addition!"}
{"text":"Full disclosure.  I didn't want to like this place.  All I could think of was...\"Gee whiz.  Another American comfort food restaurant. How boring!\". Since it's by the folks who run the chic and upscale 5 Church in Uptown, I also (incorrectly) assumed this would be the same \"see-and-be-seen\" trendy atmosphere, not something suited for the South End, where the vibe is decidedly more eclectic, casual and laid-back. 

But since N&B's opened, I've been at LEAST 10 times (No joke!  It's close to work) and every time the food has been delicious, the service fast and friendly, and just like my friends and coworkers say...reasonably priced and unpretentious. 

First off, yes, there are staples like grilled cheese and tomato soup, prime rib, and spaghetti and meatballs. These are all fine.  But what stands out, and is simply fantastic?  The beet burger (lunch and dinner) and the meatloaf burger (only for lunch). 

Let me wax poetic for a moment about the glory of the beet burger.  This genius burger includes crunchy deep fried slices of beet, goat cheese, avocado, onion, greens, buttery soft bun.  This makes for a very good sensory experience.  Add a side of greens with peach vinaigrette, and it makes for a really satisfying meal for $8.50. 

Did I mention, I don't really like beets? 

The new meatloaf burger is a relatively thin slice of their silky, meaty meatloaf, griddled with Sriracha hot sauce ketchup.  It too is excellent...and not like your traditional meat loafs. 

The atmosphere is casual and comfortable...a complete 180 from the old Vinny's Raw Bar decor.  This means my husband can wear workout gear, while I wear work clothes, and we can dine together and not worry about feeling out of place. 

BONUS: The food comes out fast.  Also, instead of bread, you get a basket of salt and pepper popcorn, which is a nice snack and change of pace to bloat-inducing bread and butter. 

TIP: People who don't want to valet for dinner service, park at the Rite Aid lot and walk about 25 feet over.  Note...the Rite Aid says they'll tow anybody who isn't a customer...but after 10+ meals here, I have yet to witness or experience this myself."}
{"text":"Not impressed. I really had high expectations for this place based on the reviews but I was highly disappointed. There were 4 of us and who ordered different meals. But, there was one thing in common.... Bland bland bland. Don't recommend!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on a weekday, no wait and was able to enjoy one the last nice days at a table outside. No issue with service.  Instead of bread, they bring out seasoned popcorn. Was not about to start my meal getting popcorn stuck in my teeth...it was a bid odd since we weren't even drinking cocktails.  Ordered the pork belly appetizer; the pork was dry, tough and not very flavorful. Entrees included steak and a chicken dish. The main proteins were cooked well, however the sides were lacking in flavor and did not compliment the dish. We did not elect to try dessert. Overall I would not go back or recommend this place, I was just happy the main proteins were half way decent."}
{"text":"Dinner last night was really good.  The pork chop was awesome.  The bartenders were especially accommodating with a special drink request for me.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Not good, prime rib was like steak and eggs at IHOP. Mac cheese tasted liked noodles w reduced milk! Someone needs to help this place out, the acoustics are that of a tunnel and you can't hear anything people two seats away are saying!"}
{"text":"I have been to Nan and Byron's several times now and love it more each time. The Nightshade Martini is hands down the best martini I've ever tasted. My favorite entree is the 8 oz. Prime Rib with the mac n cheese. The mac n cheese is a MUST TRY. Great service, great environment - definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I have been waiting for this place to open for months because it is in my neighborhood, and I finally got to go there tonight.  I went alone and sat at the bar and ordered the spicy margarita (excellent) and then dinner.  It's a dark, chic-looking place clearly in tune with the South End area, but the food is traditional American with a lot of twists.  At the bar they serve everyone popcorn, which has a spicy kick.  I ordered the chilled shrimp with New Orleans spicy remoulade, then had the spaghetti and meatballs.  That's not a common entree on restaurant menus these days, but this version was outstanding, and it had a lot of bite as well.  They seem to make lots of things spicy, even my drink, and I really like that, though it may not be for everyone.  Nonetheless, the review is my opinion reflecting my taste only, and it's 5 stars for me.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Delicious! I'm addicted to the popcorn they bring to the table! Love the atmosphere!"}
{"text":"So anyone who has read any of my reviews should know that I am a excellent cook and it is really hard for me to find food in restaurants that really excites me. Of course Nan's is in this category. We went for Fathers day Sunday Brunch and the staff was great. The buffet was the only thing available and the selection was excellent. The taste left much to be desired. The line started with muffins and Danish which were fine but not homemade. Next was a seafood tower with excellent shrimp oysters and crab legs wonderful cocktail sauce( mines better) and two salads. Dressings were nothing special and the Caesar was a little too creamy for my taste. Next was potatoes and eggs. The potatoes were under cooked and eggs over but hey it's a Buffett. Grutss were good bacon and sausage were there and that famous meatloaf was too herbal for me . I need to go back and order from the menu"}
{"text":"Great spot for drinks, brunch, lunch, or dinner.  I've been for all four and everything about this place is consistent and convenient.  Love the deviled eggs, beet burger, and mac & cheese!  I think I like it best for happy hour because the crowd is a good collection of all types.  It's definitely a favorite along with 300 East which is harder to get a reservation.  I also like that it's in walking distance to a bunch of new brewery type places.  I'd raise my review to 5 stars if the portions were bigger and if they didn't charge extra for dipping sauces.  I like to dip fries in salad dressing and charging for a tiny bit of dressing is a bit stingy.  But that is minor gripe and I'll be back again and again."}
{"text":"\"The service was good.\"  A death knell from a 17 year old.  Food service-esque fried fish--really?  Great atmosphere, but vastly better options out there.  Needs work.  I wouldn't drive past Mac's, The Liberty, or Lebowski's to get here."}
{"text":"Sunday Brunch Buffet Review:

- Food: decent selection (pastries, biscuits & gravy, bacon, sausage, shrimp & grits, eggs, pancakes, french toast, home fries, mac & cheese, potato chips & pimento cheese, chicken fried rice (?!), crab legs, shrimp, and oysters). but, nothing tasted above average except the biscuits and sriracha ketchup. most of the items were not fresh. oysters were terrible.

- Service: absolutely average, if not slightly awkward. 

- Value: meh. For $21, it wasn't worth it for me. I know, I know, you get a mimosa or bloody included... but the mimosa was super weak and the bloody was tiny, and the food didn't make up for it. Bistro la Bon's brunch buffet is better."}
{"text":"Nan and Byron's has excellent food, a well-trained and friendly staff, and a fun atmosphere.  I went on Tuesday night with friends and ordered the hushpuppies to start, which arrived absolutely delicious--perfectly fried with honey butter on the side.  I ordered the beet burger as my main course, and as a vegetarian who has encountered many \"veggie\" burgers, this one blew my mind. The burger arrived on a perfect brioche bun, smeared with avocado (my favorite). The beets stole the show, lightly coated in panko breadcrumbs and fried to achieve that perfect crunch when bitten into. I even tried dessert- strawberry shortcake, which was equally amazing!  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Had my first experience tonight. The bartender and waiters were very attentive and seemed very knowledgeable about the menu. I do feel it was a little over priced but had a great variety to choose from. However, toward the middle of my meal I got a bad taste in my mouth. It wasn't the food.I witnessed someone I had not seen earlier talking to the employees as they were trying to accommodate a large party in the \"garage room\"  I guess that's what you can call it. Apparently, the tables were not done to this persons liking. At first I thought it was a customer not satisfied with the positioning of the tables. I sat there and listened to the way this person was speaking to the employees being very loud and rude. I looked around to see that other tables were listening as well. After I saw this person go to an empty table I realized he worked there. On my way to the restroom I stopped an employee and asked who it was. I was told it was the owner. I was shocked and even more shocked when I walked out of the bathroom and saw him leaning up against an empty bar table( at the front of the restaurant), checking his phone and eating what appeared to be a banana... I never once saw him check on a table. He could have but I never witnessed it in my 2 hours of being there. He certainly never asked us how we were doing. It's hard for me to want to return after seeing the way he treated his employees. This was enough for me to download yelp for the first time and give a review..."}
{"text":"We either got the waiter's first night or they need improvement. It wouldn't have been that bad, but the food was over-priced for the quality, which was exacerbated by the service.

I think it has potential, but a little ways to go."}
{"text":"How to start this out? First impressions of this sister restaurant of 5 Church is less than mediocre. From the front when you first walk in you expect a place that's gonna give you great choices of meat, fish, and poultry localized, and taking advantage of the great farm to table scene we have here in Charlotte, but what we came to find out that's it's nothing more than the \"college kids craigslist apartment of the culinary world\".  Not one thing matches each other. NOTHING! The decor and ambience were very nice, open floor plan, very inviting, beautifully rustic with an urban feel, but only leaves you with the giant question mark or sour taste in you mouth from wanting more. (Looks aren't everything) 

When we first sat down we asked what exactly was the concept of the restaurant, and we were informed that it's \"comfort food\"? The only comfort I found was ending this Enigma of a night and asking for the bill. 


In regards to the food, poor selection, limited menu, no creativity nor flavor, and overall bland. Only 12 items that suspiciously resemble what I can receive at a place that's on the corner of 5th and church (hint, hint). It's like 4 people came up with an idea of what sells at one place, we'll through it on a menu, and add smashed bland potatoes, or a truck load of crispy onions, re-name the place in a different location and call it a day. We all understand Charlotte is not a culinary Mecca if you will, but this tom foolery is not pulling a fast one on anyone. I mean pop corn to start out at the table? Really? Something that's cheap and adds no complement nor nutritional value to the apparent question mark that's already lingering in the room. You just end up asking yourself why?

The one saving grace of this place, was something so small and minute that I wouldn't even call it saving. POPOVERS! Tasty and savory. About the only thing that actually challenged my palate whatsoever."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner recently.  I found the menu to be limited but ordered the Shrimp Pasta which I thought was just okay.  Had a bite of a friend's fish and chips and thought that the fish was very breaded and mushy. The smoked poblano cheese dip was very good though.  Atmosphere is very noisy.  Probably would choice to go elsewhere for the money."}
{"text":"Pros: popcorn! They give you buttery, perfectly seasoned popcorn before the meal. A different and unique idea than the standard bread. My husband's pork chop was perfectly cooked. Lots of menu options and I like that they have vegetarian options, like the beet burger.

Cons: the two apps we ordered weren't worth the price. The fried oysters were tiny, but tasty, although underseasoned. I didn't feel like we were getting our money worth. I ordered the meat loaf, which was dry, and the mashed potatoes, which were underwhelming and like the meat loaf, also a bit dry.

We may or may not come back."}
{"text":"First time here for a late lunch but what we got was great!! The jalapeño margarita was one of the bests I've had. The tomato soup and crab cheese half sandwich was good.  Ambiance was great.  Staff was very friendly. Service was good!! I would come back when I come back to Charlotte.  I also heard they do an awesome brunch on the weekends with bottomless mimosas! That's always a great touch!!"}
{"text":"The dessert left me feeling a little sad, the french fries were delicious (especially when drowning in ranch), and the burger... a burger is something I never forget. I got the Farmhouse Half Pounder with smoked poblano cheese, a house-made bbq sauce, and bacon. This was a Top Ten burger easily and worth every bit of the $13 price tag."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere but I was disappointed in the Sunday brunch. For $23, I would liked to have seen homemade pastries, lots of fresh berries, something inventive rather than plain scrambled eggs, home fries, hotel standards. etc. Upsides are the pimento cheese, and if you like cold steamed shrimp and crab legs. I'll definitely come back to try the non brunch menu. Tip... Don't expect mimosas before noon. State law. Looks like the place would be more fun in the evening when candles are lit and the glass garage door is thrown open for a more indoor, outdoor setting."}
{"text":"We only have come here for Sunday brunch but they have a great selection of food an did taste great.. I do love that the mimosas are only $2 a piece after the first one which is a great deal. We have been there a few times now and food is good. I am sure we will come back for lunch or dinner another time."}
{"text":"We came here on Friday night for a date night! We made reservations in advance and I am glad we did because it was packed! 

Seating:
-We walked here so I can't comment on parking. We got seated right when we walked in. The place is pretty small so be prepared to be sitting stupid close to another group/couple eating. If you have ever seen the movie Valentines Day, it is like the scene when they are out to dinner. Anyways, not a huge deal but I felt bad getting out after we were done eating cause I almost hit their table!

Drinks:
-I thought the drink selection was pretty pricey. My husband got a craft beer (about $6) and I got some white cran cosmo (about $9). My drink was tasty but I am not sure if there was any alcohol in there! It wasn't strong enough for my tastes. 

Food:
-Ok this is where Nan and Bryon's earns its stars! The food was excellent!!!
-Starters/Appetizers: They give you complimentary popcorn that was awesome! We also ordered the fried oysters, which was the appetizer special for the night. Oh. my. gosh!!! They were so good. I have no clue what was in the sauce but it was this spicy tangy mix. Awesome!
-We decided to split the meatloaf with sauteed corn and mac and cheese as sides. They brought it out split up on two plates, which is so appreciated! The meatloaf was incredible and the siracha ketchup was a perfect combo. It was a little spicy but I just took some off and solved that problem. The corn was delish! I think I could eat like 10 servings of that corn. The mac and cheese was good, not amazing but definitely good. The meatloaf is served on top of the mac and cheese and corn so beware that when you order two sides, they will basically be mixed together. I liked this cause our sides complimented each other!
-Decided to forgo dessert but it sounded good.

Overall, great place and I can't wait to see where it will go in the futre."}
{"text":"Weekend Night Dinner:

No tables available, seemed like a very busy place, private party in a tent, but plenty of room at the bar so decided to eat there with a friend. Atmosphere at this place is really nice.

Drink service was really poor, our bartender struggled with making an irish coffee, had to be sent back twice. Also had to explain how to make an old fashioned to her, which is a fairly simple drink.

Had the cheese and meat sampler for an appetizer, fantastic. The goat cheese is great, as well as the sweet beef.

I had the portobello mushrooms for dinner which were fairly average, the sweet potato casserole was too starchy and salty. My friend had the steak salad had good presentation, but steak was very well done.

Price was average, I believe total bill was $68, server really struggled on how to split a bill, took about 15-20 minutes.

Didn't find anything here that would have me coming back."}
{"text":"First time for the brunch and was impressed given it was their first day serving brunch. 

Omelette was very good with fresh quality ingredients. Portobello mushrooms, fresh kale and tomatoes. Rye toast was very good as well. 

Only complaint would be the extra charges for jelly and hot sauce. That should be provided with the meal. 

I will be back!"}
{"text":"The service is absolutely terrible: hostesses didn't greet us, our waiter (or I would say bartender because it sounds that they only have bartenders and bus man) give our table to someone else, explaining that his shift his over (the most unprofessional behavior that I've never seen) and our new waitress was very rude and couldn't figure it out what we ordered so we have to repeat again everything.... In addition she removes our plates without asking us anything... If I give 1 star it's because the food was okay, we get the scallops, mac and cheese and sweet potato but the desserts was absolutely disgusting (cheesecake and apple tart). So please stay away from the restaurant, for the same price you can find a better service and better food aswell. I am not usually a picky person but this restaurant is absolutely a mess, and of course we won't come back."}
{"text":"I had an opportunity to get here a few weeks ago and better-yet twice within that one week. My first visit was centered around the bar as the plan was to check out the atmosphere of what appeared to be the new hot spot restaurant in South End. Having just recently moved from Uptown to a South End I was anxious to see what the fellas from 5 Church had going on. 

Snagging a spot at the corner of the bar offered a great view of a pretty busy restaurant for a weekday. The bar tenders were attentive and friendly even considering a full bar. After 30 minutes or so I I had to take a peak at the menu and decided that contrary to my initial plan of \"drinks only\" I was going to grab something small. Now, when a restaurant aims for what it appears Nan and Byron's is aiming for I like to give a good test of the menu and order something a bit atypical. That said, by offering a hot dog and mac and cheese a place like this I couldn't pass this opportunity up. It wasn't even on the kid's menu! Let's be honest, if you can nail a hot dog and mac and cheese at what appears to be a quality restaurant than more power to ya. Certainly I agree that with this order I couldn't have possibly expected much, but again, it is Nan and Byron's that offered it and so I had to take them up on it. 

Unfortunately I was pretty disappointed. I can't complain much about the value as these were some of the less expensive items on the menu but I can certainly complain of the quality. Honestly, if you are going to go out on a limb by offering a hot dog at a place like this then I'd expect you would at least reward the customer daring enough to order it. The presentation itself was good but the flavor wasn't much greater than what you'd expect from your most basic hot dog. When I asked the bar tender what we were dealing with she admitted she thinks it is a Nathan's hot dog...boiled! Not grilled, but boiled. Who in their right mind boils a Nathan's frank! As for the mac and cheese I can't really speak much about it; not much to write home about and although creamy couldn't help but think \"Velveeta\". I'm sure it wasn't and maybe I'm more of a baked mac and cheese guy but this wasn't doing it for me. 

Although I will admit this isn't the end of the world for food delivered to my bar stool but I don't think I would be happy if I placed this order from a table. However, this is the point of the experiment, no? Try something from the menu so atypical that likely very few people would order it in an attempt to test the integrity of the one who decided to place the item on the menu to begin with. It is that mindset that brought me back to Nan and Byron's for \"round 2\" less than a week later to try something more typically ordered.

On my second visit I decided to go for more or the full experience; grab a table and order something more typical. When my girlfriend and I arrived it was Friday around 9:30pm. Upon entering we were greeted by the hostess who was quick to ask us if we had a reservation. I thought it was strange to ask considering the number of tables available. Since we of course didn't have a reservation the hostess asked us to take a seat to wait for the next available table. Now, I'm not sure if this was a ploy to make them seem busier than they were or possibly an attempt to limit the workload on their staff. Either way it is always frustrating to wait for a table when 1) you are only a party of two and 2) you can see empty tables. At the end of the day it wasn't more than a 15 minute wait so not a huge deal. 

Once we were seated I began to take in the atmosphere itself. The setup of the restaurant is great and the design is appealing. I can see this place being a good go-to for a casual date night. As per my previous experience I can attest to the friendliness of the bartenders and could see a drink or two first at the bar before grabbing a table for dinner being a great date experience. Additionally, who could say anything bad about the decision to serve fresh popcorn in place of the old standby bread? Who doesn't love popcorn?!? By the time the waiter took his second pass we were ready to order and I went with his recommendation which was the meatloaf while my girlfriend went with a standard cheese burger. The meatloaf was okay in that the consistency was good, not dry etc. Serving size was good and the roasted corn was very good thought maybe a bit \"too roasted\" with some bites. However, although I can understand the difficulty in getting the spices right in a meatloaf it truly had waaaay too much rosemary in it. Unfortunately the overwhelming flavor of the rosemary overpowered any other possible flavors and made for a less than perfect experience. The mashed potatoes had some pretty good flavor but were cold in both my order and my girlfriends.

I can't say I wont be back here but I'm certainly not going to rush back. I think this place is certainly worth a shot and with a few tweaks can easily bring my rating up to a 4-star."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was good; food was inconsistent. I ordered the mussels as an appetizer; they were horrible. The menu said they were PEI mussels, but there is no way. They were small, tiny little things. And they were served with one very small piece of bread in a huge bowl of sauce. Do NOT order these. For entrees, our table ordered the tacos, the filet and the pork chop. Filet was excellent, pork chop average and tacos very good. For dessert, we had a brownie sundae, which was obviously microwaved. The first few bites we so hot I burned my mouth and the last few bites were inedible because the brownie was rock hard. The filet is why I'm giving a second star. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Love this cute place!
I had their beet burger with sweet potato fries and it was sooo good! I don't know which one I liked better, the burger or the fries!! 
We also had the deviled eggs for our appetizer but that was just okay...and the popcorn they serve you for free, I can do with out that too..its just whatever!

But I will definitely be back for the beet burger and sweet potato fries =)"}
{"text":"I have been to Nan and Byron's twice.  Once with a large group and one with another couple for dinner.  They definetly did a much better job with our smaller group.  So I would probably not choose somewhere else to dine with a large group for a special occasion.

The atmosphere in there is kind of a farmhouse feel but upscale casual. Parking on a busy night is kind of pain but they do have valet which is nice. I got the meatloaf and really enjoyed it but did not feel like it was anthing extrodinary.  I think that their cocktail selection is what I enjoyed most.  They had a wide variety of cocktails that were fun to try.  I would suggest stopping in here for a drink at the bar for sure."}
{"text":"As a girl who appreciates the delicacies from the coast, I hated the seafood on the brunch buffet. Bloody Mary's were the worst I've had in Charlotte. Meh!"}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere. Sweet hostesses that seated us on time. Food, service and bartenders were all five stars!  Looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"I went with a group of friends for restaurant week. I started with the Caesar, as did one of my friends. It was a pretty typical Caesar salad. Another friend got the Cobb salad, which looked amazing, and she said it was. For the entree part I ordered the chicken with corn & mashed potatoes. The chicken was cooked quite nicely. It was pretty flavorful, but what set it off was the sauce that came with it. The corn was what I would've expected. Mashed potatoes a bit above average, I could've easily eaten more. The deserts were nothing spectacular. 

But on the service side; phenomenal! The server was incredibly knowledgable. He also knew the perfect balance of being attentive, without overbearing. Additionally he also time our meal perfectly."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love Nan and Byron's. It's a hip restaurant that has made a name for itself in the Charlotte dining scene. Unfortunately it has been a let down the two times I've gone. The first time was for dinner and the experience was \"okay\". I ordered one of their chicken dishes and some other fusion appetizer. There was a long wait to receive our meals and when it arrived the dishes were just merely acceptable--if anything, rather boring. 

This second time I wanted to give the restaurant another try. I was hopeful that it would be as good as what everyone has hyped it up to be. Unfortunately the results of my visit were much worse than the first. From their dinner menu I ordered their Tuna Tartar (raw) and their Braised Lamb (medium rare). These are two risky but common dishes, and if done well, are usually quite wonderful. Unfortunately one (or both) of these dishes gave me food poisoning later on. Nothing severe, but unpleasant to say the least. Not sure what went wrong there, but I can say the lamb was a rubbery mess that was hardly edible and something I really should've sent back to the kitchen.

The service also did not improve the second time around. The wait was even longer for something less than satisfactory. The only redeeming factor of my visit was the Banana Pudding for dessert which was surprisingly good. It's a shame everything else wasn't. I can assure you there won't be a third try."}
{"text":"NOTE TO MANAGER** you need to train your staff to warn customers if the plates are 500 degrees when they put them down in front of them! I have bad blistering after lightly touching the plate to scoot it over and it would have been easy for her to have said \"Ladies, these plates are hot so don't touch!\" The plates were just waaaay too hot anyway. All 3 of our meals looked like the been sitting under a heat lamp for 10 min. And did we get free anything for that? No, just mustard to put all over it to take the pain away.

On separate note, we came for Queens Feast at 6:30 and you'd think they'd want to get us in and out as things got busier. Basically the service just slowed to a hault by 7 and we waited forever to get our meals and drinks. We even had to take our desert to go. And the deserts were pitiful. Key lime pie was supposed to have berries - but none. Smores cheesecake had a lightly browned marshmallow on top of regular cheesecake - pitiful. Although shrimp and grits was good, none of us will be back."}
{"text":"Wow. What a disaster. 

We were sat by the service station. A broom handle loomed over my head. The place was not even a fifth full. It was brunch and we chose the buffet.

At the buffet, every single plate was wet. Not slightly damp, but covered in water. The plates are right next to the host station, I guess that everyone stationed there chose not to notice us wiping our plates dry.

The pastries were cut into smaller pieces (quartered, etc) and dry. The potatoes had so much salt on them, it burned my tongue. And the oysters on the half shell!!! Whoa. They had \"melted\"- flattened out and filled the shell and now had a firm texture. In a word- disgusting.

I covered my mostly untouched food with a napkin, the waitress asked if I wanted another plate for the buffet. Uh, no.

Never again."}
{"text":"OMG. I hate this place.  Okay, it's a love/hate relationship mainly due to too many good choices on the menu.  Beginning with the appetizers, soups and salads, I wanted to try so many things.  So, we split the Peppedew Poppers (try saying that 3 times fast without laughing) as they were highly recommended, and I ditto that recommendation as they are flavorful, but not too spicy (in-between a bell pepper and a jalapeño).  They have 3 soups to try, and we tried the chicken tortilla which was very chunky with lots of corn and good amounts of chicken.  It was more of a thicker brown mole base broth, but still flavorful.  I like that they have two salad sizes (small and large) for reasonable cost and allows you to have somewhat healthy start to the meal in a starter size.  We tried the side/small cobb salad and it was just the right size and full of good ingredients.

After all of those starters, we had to tell them to not to refill the complimentary spicy popcorn which they keep refilling at the table (yes it is good), we moved on to entrees.  Friend got the fish and chips which was done properly in the traditional sense, but not too greasy and she was happy.  I had the roasted chicken mainly because I wanted to try two of the sides offered.  The chicken was flavorful like a jerk flavoring and they give you a nice breast/wing + leg/thigh that are quite tasty.  I went with the brussels sprouts recommend side and peas/carrots, and they balanced well with the meal (both good).  Needless to say, a great meal, and we had to each take To Go containers home.  Friendly and knowledgeable staff were very attentive.  I am looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Try the beet burger...delicious...it's all beet with no fillers, topped with boursin cheese, a little arugula, and some avocado.  I would definitely order it again.  We sat at the bar, service was quick and the bartender was friendly and helpful as it was our first time there. Parking was difficult but worth the extra effort it took to find a spot."}
{"text":"My sweaty yoga girls and I came for brunch again on Sunday 17 Jan... we had a VERY good experience, service-wise, and thoroughly enjoyed the brunch buffet!  Thank you to our sweet server, and the gracious hostess who took care of us!"}
{"text":"Went back to this restaurant for the first time since opening week and was extremely disappointed. The service was slow and unpleasant. The food was average at best. The manager on duty kept hovering over the bartender with an attitude. I talked this place up and to boot my friend felt ill the rest of the night after eating here. I will not go back again."}
{"text":"We sat outside for brunch. The staff was nice but the wait for food on Sunday's is forever! The kitchen gets backed up because of the buffet and a la carte. If you're looking for immediate food go with the brunch. 

I had the salmon Benedict (pretty small). The French toast is really good though but super sweet! 

I'd say the wait is why it loses a few stars and the Benedict wasn't super amazing."}
{"text":"Disappointments across the board. The one thing this place has going for it is the ambiance. Server was super friendly and offered good conversation. Unfortunately our meal was a disaster. . .chicken tacos were overloaded with Jicama, which competed with the dry Jamaican jerk styled breast. The braised pork tacos were even worse with a dried shredded pork rind presence; it left your mind with the unpleasant experience of trying to imagine how good it should have been. The oysters (which are amazing at rooster's and 204 North!) had too much competition on the plate with heavy slices of pineapple and seed laden jalapeño slices to compete with. Amazingly, the smoked chicken wings were drenched in so much rub they too created competing flavors. Overall, it was a major disappointment, but the combos should have rocked... maybe a new inexperienced chef??? We'll never know, we shared our poor food production with the friendly waitress and only received our full bill with no greeting from the manager. Won't be recommending, but on a high note the local craft beer was high class 10/10 and the server was nice."}
{"text":"Was here once prior and had a nice time. Returned for their 2 year anniversary night with the select $2 menu and was extremely disappointed. 

Had a reservation for two people and did not get seated until 30 minutes after. Okay, I get it, you may have taken too many reservations to sit, but 30 mins is pushing it for a two top.

Got sat and were greeted 15 minutes later. Ordered drinks and food at the same time. Received our drinks about ten mins later by another server. Look, the restaurant was busy, but this was now over 45 mins to get a drink after our reservation time.

Saw our server 45 minutes later to be asked if we wanted dessert (not having received our meal yet). He realized how long the wait was for our food and said he was checking on it. 25 minutes later he still hasn't returned with an update. 

We left cash for our drinks and left without receiving our food. I understand food takes a while when the place is packed, but at least give us an update after apologizing for the delay and \"checking on the food.\" Both of us were servers and would have been understanding.

Anyway, we won't be returning unfortunately."}
{"text":"Our group of four had a reservation for a late dinner here on a Saturday evening.  We chose to eat inside, although there is an outside dining area.  At first, I thought it would be more crowded, but we were seated immediately.  The server got our drink orders quickly.  I had the four taco platter and could only finish one of them.  The other people in our group were happy with their meals which included: deluxe burger and side of Mac and Cheese; special taco platter with shrimp; and a shrimp, sausage and grits mix.  
The service was very good, but I thought the prices were a little high, but they may be comparable to the area."}
{"text":"Great brunch on sundays..the menu us fresh and I like the way it is setup. Tables are outside when the weather is nice. Service for drinks were fast both times I visited them. Average price if you need to compare them with other brunch places. I will comeback"}
{"text":"Pop corn- They bring this in place of bread.  The seasoning that comes on it was a hot spicy OMG hot not expecting that.  I ended up getting plain and sprinkled salt on it, then it was good! 

Tinny drinks - gin a tonic & vodka tonic
  * came week and tinny

Salmon- my friend said good, but really nothing special.

Yukon gold mashed potatoes - needed serious doctoring. Wouldn't get again!

Mac n cheese - came with breading (not a fan of crusties on my pasta) the pasta was very soft, but the taste was decent"}
{"text":"After having a handful of very good meals here, today I got extra lucky when I scored Kevan as my server. He is a self-professed food and drink connoisseur who nailed every recommendation with amazing accuracy. We had the nightshade martini to start (pomegranate juice with muddled cucumber and mint leaves to add some unexpected fresh flavor twists) followed by the kitchen sink salad and then the beet burger. Admittedly, I have seen that beet burger many times on the menu before, but immediately discarded it as a possible choice. It took server Kevan's encouragement to give it a try -  and boy am I glad I did as it is absolutely my favorite burger on the planet at the moment!"}
{"text":"I have ordered delivery with Foodie call multiple times.  Normally the food is very good, however there have been 2 times that the sauces have been way to salty.  I ordered the chicken pot pie this week and the chicken was salty and the brown sauce was way too salty.  My guess is they are salting the chicken, then using stock with salt already in it, and then adding salt and reducing it down and not tasting their sauce.  Really need to fix this!!  Everything else with the chicken pot pie was really good and liked the flaky biscuit/pastry served with it.  I also got the cheese plate and I really liked everything on here :)"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite restaurant...ever. It was so good that I can't wait to go back to Charlotte again. Really stellar beer selection and the burrata was out of this world good. I can't say enough good things about this place!!!!"}
{"text":"Joined some friends, waited at the table for fifteen minutes with no server coming over, so I decided to go to the bar to grab a drink. I waited about five minutes there before being acknowledged. Some really poor service."}
{"text":"We went here for the first time on 9/8/15 
I will never go back!!! The service was very unprofessional. We ask for dirty martinis and they tasted like dirty soap water.

Jamie, if you want your business to continue, you should teach your staff how to be professional and courteous to the customers that are walking through your door.

And just a side-note, I was born and raised in the Dilworth area so I know the changes that have and are happening and this place will not survive. I don't care how many restaurants you own.

As a realtor I would not recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"I wanted to wait and give Nan & Byron's a fair shake and go a number of times, especially since I love their sister restaurant 5 Church. It has a very different vibe than 5 Church- a more casual, yet still hopping atmosphere with rustic interior touches. I've been here for cocktails, dinner and three times for lunch. It's totally appropriate for SouthEnd.

I highly endorse it for a place to meet friends for cocktails. Their cocktail/bar menu is inventive and delicious. The bartenders are pretty speedy and friendly. 

As Chad mentioned, the popcorn they give you is a nice way to give your mouth something to crunch on that I believe is nonfat (it's not oily, salty or buttery). It's a good thing because food comes out really really slowly and often not coordinated. In my experience if you have a table of 2, the meals come out at the same time. But if you have more than 2, it's your guess at what order/timing everything will come out. I don't mind that at a tapas place where you're sharing plates with friends, but in a business context where you have  a sandwich and someone else has another sandwich or salad and you're not sharing, it's polite to wait until everyone has their meal.  The other complaint I have about the timing is that the three times I've been for lunch have extended to a 2-hour lunch unnecessarily. Apparently you should announce a the beginning of the meal to your server that you need to get back to work. After about an hour and a half, the last time my coworkers and I had lunch, we asked for the check (even though we weren't done) because we had to get back to work and the server seemed genuinely surprised. Huh? It's a weekday, why wouldn't we have to go back to work??? It was bizarre. Anyway my point is, it's totally fine for a catch up lunch with a friend on a weekend, but beware of a long lunch if you're a working stiff. 

To the food... the peppadew poppers are really interesting and if you're willing to throw caution of calories to the wind, I highly endorse them.  The meatloaf is very grilled - I like the taste of it but the hubs did not. I appreciated the sriracha ketchup.  I do not really like the chicken- it runs very dry and the green beans I've had twice and both times they were over cooked.  If I were to go back for dinner I'd like to try the mushroom with quinoa or Tofu since their vegetarian entrees seem to be more interesting than their carnivorous ones.   For lunch, I definitely like the beet burger with boursin - it's my favorite thing on the menu. They brag about the farmhouse burger but there was something about it I didn't like. It was either the BBQ sauce or the poblano cheese, but the consistency and taste wasn't so good. Based on the wait my burger was \"dying in the window\" for a while and the cheese coagulated leaving a grainy, weird consistency. So my tip is definitely get the beet burger- you can't get that anywhere else, build your own burger. My friends really like the South End chicken hoagie too.  Though one time two of them got it and they came out at 2 different times and had different things on it. 

For dessert, the shortcake is very heavy. We were able to take 2 bites of it and the rest went uneaten. The PB&J was very interesting and different so my favorite of the two. Next time I'd try the brownie sundae with chili sauce. 

Bottom line- 2.5 stars - this is a place for cocktails or a place to go if you need something greasy, but just make sure you're not in a hurry or expect fantastic service."}
{"text":"The drink menu and bartender service is outstanding. I come here for happy hour with friends because it's so much quieter than other places in South End. However, the food is really underwhelming. I haven't eaten anything there that I felt I couldn't make at home."}
{"text":"I went to Nan and Byron's on their soft opening night and was super excited to dive into the menu as soon as we arrived. We valeted our car (which was complimentary that evening) because apparently there typically isn't enough parking in that lot. 

We were seated immediately upon arriving and our server was energetic and helpful, although she did seem a bit nervous but, hey, it was their first weekend being open! 

We ordered several things from the menu and a couple items stuck out: the siracha meatloaf and cheesecake. The pricing seemed to be fair considering the menu items were more of a casual fare than sister restaurant 5Church. The atmosphere of the restaurant is a bit similar to 5Church in the way that it's hip, classy and comfortable. I actually did notice a few TVs throughout the restaurant as well, which would be nice while eating dinner here on game days. 

My only complaint was the Pimento Cheese appetizer was WAY too heavy. My boyfriend and I couldn't even finish the plate. I'm sure that's an easy kink to work out, though. 

All in all, I would definitely go back to Nan and Byrons to try their other menu items, especially on a warmer day when the garage door in the dining room can be open! This pace will definitely be rocking during the Spring/Summer because of it's fun atmosphere & open-air dining room."}
{"text":"OK Nan and Byron...this was my last trip.  Given that your blocks from my home, I have given you more chances than you deserve.  After multiple meals from dinner to brunch, you have left me with no choice....from the marginal service, to the limited menu and poorly served meals, less than fresh seafood, to not being able to keep the food for the brunch buffet warm or available I'm calling it quits.  To future diners, you have been warned so don't let the trendy setting or good cocktails lure you to a bad experience.  We have better options in the area."}
{"text":"So I finally made it here and left a little underwhelmed. 

I was not impressed with the parking situation. Seriously, even on a Tuesday night when you would think there would be plenty of open spaces....there just were not any. So you can valet or hope you don't get towed in the Rite Aid parking lot. Good luck with that! 

For me the menu was pretty limited. Now, I'm not saying they need 17 pages of choices but I would have liked something outside of chicken, fish and meatloaf. The side option selection was much better. 

I went with a burger, a side of mac and cheese and a cold glass of Triple C's Smoked Amber. Everything was just fine. Nothing really knocked my socks off and converted me into a fan but for what it was....A-Ok. 

What bothered me the most was that this place is SO loud. I couldn't hear anything. I seriously spent most of the night repeating things to my waitress and dining party which eventually turned into me yelling just to avoid repeating...No, thank you...I'll pass. 

I've been, checked it off my list but I won't be running back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Started out at the bar and the atmosphere is great. The service at the bar could be better,  it wasn't busy and it still took along time to get a drink. The waitress was very friendly and helpful. The food was good and plated beautifully. We will be back for dinner in the future."}
{"text":"I've been to Nan and Byron's for lunch twice now and have thoroughly enjoyed each visit. My favorite part of Nan's is the décor. I would describe it as modern farmhouse chic as they incorporate natural wood, cowhide rugs, metal chairs, and rustic embellished walls. The back dining room has a garage-style door that opens up to a patio. Really love everything about venue.
 
The food features a twist on traditional southern comfort food with dishes like meatloaf, farmhouse burger, mac n' cheese, deviled eggs, shepherd's pie, and more. Nan's offered a brunch buffet every Sunday for $21 with a la carte options as well.

I've had the Southend chicken hoagie ($10) and crispy beet burger ($8.5), both off the lunch menu. The hoagie featured marinated chicken breast, sautéed peppers and onions, lettuce, tomato, American cheese, and spicy green sauce. It was a disastrous mess to try and eat gracefully but was a delicious combination of flavors. Note: I substituted the American cheese with poblano cheese...Yum!

 The crispy beet burger was my favorite of the two and came served with boursin cheese, arugula, red onions and avocado. The crunch of the beet paired perfectly with the creamier textures of boursin cheese and avocado. Can't say I've ever had anything like this sandwich and it was delicious (plus light enough to return to work without napping!)

I also had a bite of the Farmhouse burger and was impressed with flavor and texture of the patty but was looking for a little more of the barbeque sauce that was supposed to be on the sandwich.

Both times service was helpful and attentive, especially after we noticed a pricing error on one of our ordered items. Would definitely return to Nan and Byron's and am hoping to sample brunch and dinner menu items soon."}
{"text":"I think this place is a 3.5 across the board. I've been here a few times for dinner, and once for cocktails at the bar. The inside is so quaint and homey. The bar is so inviting and just calls out to you - I've enjoyed many a cocktails there. I remember having the Nighshade martini, which I liked. The cucumber and mint helped tone down the strong, tart pomegranate flavor. My husband and I recently came in for dinner for the 3rd time. We started with the mussels. I'm a huge mussels lover so whenever I see them, I pretty much always order them. These were decent, but something about them seemed off this time compared to previous. Ours were lacking the garlic flavor and the bread was a little mushy. While I was so tempted to try the beet burger (still on the bucket list!), I had the signature tacos for my meal. I really like how they have so many different options to choose from - I got the jerk chicken, beer braised pork, ground beef and crispy shrimp. The pork was my favorite - not much taste to the jerk chicken, and surprisingly, there wasn't much meat! The meat to taco ratio was really poor, in my opinion. My husband had the meatloaf and he liked it. The service was relatively slow, though. unfortunately, no great pictures since we sat outside (they have a neat patio!). I still want to go for brunch. It's a shame this place isn't reviewed higher - they have a great spot and beautiful decor inside. I still think there is much potential to be had!"}
{"text":"I really like Nan & Byron's. I love the experience of eating there, I think must be the atmosphere. It is so nice yet so cozy inside! It feels really intimate even though it's not very quiet and usually pretty packed.

The food is always very good. On Wednesday night we ordered the cheese and meat board. It was delicious. There is half price wine on Wednesday nights so it worked out perfectly. My boyfriend got the burger, which he loves there, and I got the Burrata salad with Salmon for the first time. It was my favorite thing I have ever ordered there and one of my favorite salads ever. SO good.

While the service can be very hit or miss here, my experience on Wednesday night was great. Our server was attentive, knowledgeable, and never pushy. I do wish their service was more consistent. 

One last tip- is you like sweet drinks, order their signature strawberry lemonade vodka drink! So refreshing and not overly sugary."}
{"text":"I haven't written a bad review in a long time, but Nan and Bryon's is just asking for it. 

I'm with a group of friends and decided on Nan and Bryon's after a stop at the new dog bar (Lucky Dog). We called and there was no wait on a Saturday night, which was the prime selling point (perhaps a red flag as well). 

They sat us quickly and I settled on the shrimp and grits. The waitress completely sold us on it and sadly, a complete let down. The portion is tiny and the grits were hard and absolutely terrible. I finished the shrimp and andouille sausages because I was starving. Afterwards, I'm still starving! I was concerned about the portion size and even asked the waitress. She said she would be able to provide a side if we need it, which is great. Unfortunately, she never asked and never came back! The bf got the \"chicken pot pie,\" also flavorless and not at all special. On top of that, both of our meals were over $20. I much rather go to Cluck N Cup down the street for my chicken pot pie ($7!) and basically anywhere else for shrimp and grits. 

The last time I was here I ordered a medium rare steak. Instead, I got well done. I sent it back and they came back with rare. I kept it because again, starving. I think I've given nan and Bryon's enough chances. Sorry, not sorry."}
{"text":"What an utter disappointment. The dinner was mediocre, but the service... the service was truly the worst I've experienced in years. There were only a few other tables in the restaurant, but our server disappeared for long stretches of time, and when we finally could get our check, there were so many errors and upcharges. I had to request that she remove an entree we hadn't ordered, and she added various upcharges that weren't accurate. I'd heard good things about the restaurant and had high hopes, but I wouldn't visit here again."}
{"text":"OK, let me first--- spill the beans, I heart the chefs at 5Church and Nan and Byron's, I can't help it- they are both dreamy and sarcastic, so therefore I can't resist their charm or their poblano cheese dip French fries, so sue me.

I have been multiple times, brunch, lunch and dinner, the other day I ordered a cup of coffee.  I couldn't believe how good their coffee was, that alone gets the fifth star from me.

There were three of us and we ordered a large Cobb salad to share,  they divided it for us in three tiny bowls.  That was way beyond the call of duty..  

So excited to hear they serve breakfast, ready to go check it out and drink some more coffee!!  Naaaaah, I'm gonna drink booze.  For extra credit points must get a jalapeno margarita!!!"}
{"text":"Visited this place on opening weekend, and boy we're we in for a treat. Just landed from our flights from MD. We freshened up and headed right over there, we had reservation, seated right away.The place was packed our server was a little off beat but she kept everything running smooth after missing ordering our appetizer.
The ambiance was nice, the decor is simple and chic. I must say I fell inlove with the food and drinks, I don't eat beef and had to try to husband meatloaf, the aroma was just too tempting not to try it.
The manager or maitre D came to greet us, after telling her that it was my husbands birthday and we are OT from Maryland. She sent us desert and a card wishing him a happy birthday with a 10% card for our next visit.

Upon our last night in Charlotte, we wanted to do late dining and had reservation at the Bernadin but their kitchen closes at 10...... and wanted to really relax and not be rushed during our meals. If you guessed we came back here????? You betcha, they were open until 11pm on a mOnday night.
Again The food and service were superb. Also for the quality of food that is served, the price is very very reasonable.
As we left that night I long to revisit Charlotte just to eat that meatloaf again... Ooops I went beef yall  (which I haven't eaten in more than 10years) ... I ate that meatloaf like it was my last meal...

Kudos and hats off to Nan & Byron
Great for dates
Great for groups.

Kisses to you"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh this place was amazing. 

We went on Saturday night for dinner at 8:30. Which by the way was the easiest reservation to make ever because their website was so convenient! 

Anyways, we went for dinner. When we were seated they brought popcorn to the table and we ordered drinks. My drink was delicious I don't remember the name but it was proseco, white cranberry juice and dried cranberries very good not too sweet.  We then started wth the pick five meat and cheese platter which was awesome.  I liked that we got to decide which cheese and meat we wanted! 

My boyfriend got the ny strip steak which came with truffle fries ( yum!) and broccolini. And I got the salmon which was a huge portion(!) on top of Yukon potatoes and broccolini with a balsamic sauce. Everything was delicious. It took a little while for our food to come but they gave us a free drink to compensate. 

Oh, and Don't forget dessert! We got banana pudding and homemade Oreos. That's right homemade Oreos, and they came with a glass of milk! Both dishes were great! 

Over all I've got to say this is my new favorite restaurant in Charlotte! It's five stars for me for sure. Everything was delicious and the staff was super nice too! This place is a must try."}
{"text":"Had dinner here on a Saturday night. We sat at the bar which was perfectly fine as there were no available tables. 

I had the steak tacos and hubby had a cheeseburger with Mac and cheese as his side item. The meat in my tacos was underseasoned. Husband enjoyed his burger. The Mac and cheese was okay, but not spectacular. 

The atmosphere is very nice, and the bartenders were attentive. Other diners were offered popcorn while waiting for their food, though...not sure why we weren't offered any. We also got the feeling that they were trying to rush us out. 

I won't actively avoid returning here, but also won't go out of my way to come back. The overall experience was alright, but not worth the price."}
{"text":"Great selection at the bar. I tried a rum drink but the lemonade looked delicious. Customer service was top notch. Kitchen closed at 10pm and we got there just 20 min before. I ordered the mushroom ravioli. I love how the flavor of the mushrooms really pop out. The white cream sauce was kinda salty. The peas helped the flavor. My friend got the steak salad and said it was perfect. The steak was medium rare and flavorful with a tangy mix of dressing and fresh greens. The decor was nice, lighting soft. They have a mix of high tables, booths and regular tables. On cold evenings don't sit by the front. The large glass doors allow a lot of the cold in when opened. They had a beer garden in the back. I'd come back just to try the many options on the cocktail list."}
{"text":"Two stars. One for the service and the other for the decor and atmosphere. 

Appetizer- Some kind of poblano dip we shared and it had a gravy like consistency and I hate to say it, tasted like hot dogs a bit. Ran out of chips as there weren't many to start with.

Meals- I ordered the fish and chips and the coating looked like a well done french baguette. The fish itself was over cooked and the fries seemed to be out of the freezer.

My wife ordered their chicken sandwich.. Simple right? Nope. What looked like a merita bun a piece of lettuce and a tomato... No flavor at all. Then the peas and carrots side looked like something you grab from teeters freezer aisle.

Then our friend had a grilled cheese sandwich that was one piece of toast cut in half and toasted... The cheese was barely melted and the tomato soup had the consistency of marinara sauce.

The only person at our table that was happy was the one who ordered the brunch buffet. So that is a plus I suppose.

I wanted to love this place but they missed the mark big time with the food. I really regret not asking the waiter and the front of the house manager to try the food. 

They really were apologetic and accommodating and the service as I said was pretty good. But they really need to know the quality of the stuff they put out so they can serve with even more confidence."}
{"text":"Friends asked me to come out and meet them at Nan & Byron's for drinks and apps. It was early for dinner - around 6pm, so parking was a breeze - but they also have valet for later when parking get crazy.

Southend is filled with good places to eat and drink, and this is one of them. Easy casual atmosphere with some posh touches here and there. Whether you are dressy or casual, you will be comfortable here.

Loved the deviled eggs and the peppers as apps.

The beet burger, the kale with poached egg and the sweet potato fries - all amazing!

The brownie dessert - yum!

Drinks: The jalapeño margarita, the rosemary bellini - oh yum!

A great place to meet friends, a good date spot too."}
{"text":"For starters, I love the look of this restaurant. This place is very rustic/farmhouse and is very aesthetically pleasing. The food was good but I was not ~blown away~. I decided to venture out of my normal comfort zone and go for the beet burger. No regrets here, it was quite tasty. The sides however are what were lacking. My friends and I all got different sides for the most part and they were all just ok, not great for what you are paying. A lot of my sweet potato fries were burnt so that was pretty disappointing. 


Great and friendly service though and I would go back to try another dish. I got their special Gin cocktail (forget the name they call it) and it was good. Also tried some farmhouse lemonade which was good as well."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that if it was just food that I was evaluating it would have been a 4  star rating...however, I have to rate the entire experience.  My partner and I visited last evening and had a nice dinner - food was excellent, the popcorn that they serve when you first arrive is very flavorful and the wait staff was efficient.  

After dinner however, we decided to stay to have a drink or two at the bar - this is where things went south.  They had one bartender serving the entire restaurant and she was simply overwhelmed.  It took more than 10 minutes to get a beer and once finished took at least 15 min for her to even notice that our beer and wine glasses were empty.  We wanted to order an appetizer to snack on, but simply couldn't get her attention.  For our check, we had to stop the manager and ask for our check, which he brought to us after another wait period.  Bottom line, they really need help at the bar during the peak hours - they honestly lost money we were ready to spend on more food and drinks....

If you are going to Nan and Byron's, expect good, unique food choices - but expect a long wait for drinks, unless we came on a fluke day where they were simply understaffed."}
{"text":"I was on my way to Tupelo Honey, but they weren't open at 10:30 so I decided to stop in and check this place out instead.  I pulled on the fork and bellied up to the bar.  They had a good assortment of local beer and a friendly bartender.  I decided to skip the alcohol and went straight for the deviled eggs.  They tasted as I expected.  Nothing spectacular, but still hit the spot for deviled eggs.  The presentation was nice and they came out very quickly.  
For my entree I had the meatloaf sandwich with a side of mac and cheese.  The meatloaf sandwich was awesome with the spicy ketchup.  It was everything I expected and more.  Tender meatloaf on a delicious bun with spicy ketchup?  What isn't to like?

The mac and cheese?  I think there are as many mac and cheese recipes in the south as there are stars in the sky.  We all have a preference for a different type.  I personally prefer the big ziti-type noodle in bechamel type sauce with baked-on cheese on top...almost like a macaroni casserole.  This was almost the opposite.  The noodles were big spirals and were awesome, but the cheese was smooth like velveeta.  It still tasted good, but I prefer my Mac and Cheese to have a bit of personality.
The real star of the meal was the bartender who kept my tea constantly full.  Great service and good food = repeat business in my book."}
{"text":"Ambiance = pretty good 
Service = okay, but a bit slow
Food = good
Prices = a bit on the high side 
Drinks = good selection but a bit pricey

Good for groups, but bring a side of patience and an extra $20 for good measure"}
{"text":"I was excited to come to Nan and Byron's for my friends birthday brunch. I was a little skeptical though about the mixed Yelp reviews. But I decided to give it a try. I really do hate writing bad reviews but this time it's warranted. First, the service was really slow. Although we had a large party of 9, 5 of us ordered from the a la carte menus and everyone else had the buffet. It took an hour for our a la carte dishes to get to us. And there were only 3 more parties of about 2-3 people each in thise parties. So there is no need for our service to be that slow. When our food arrived, the home fries we ordered were burnt to a crisp. I posted a picture of the burnt potaties. We were saddened that the chef actually sent the plates out with burnt home fries. The bacon on our burgers wasn't even done and it wasn't crispy. They did get the temperature of my burger correct. Sadly to say, this wasn't a good experience at Nan and Byron's that's why they're getting a 1."}
{"text":"Me and my family came here for brunch on July 2nd. I really wanted Chicken and Waffles, but they didn't have that on the menu. They did have a buffet with sooooo many food choices. I could list it all...and I will! Pastries (muffins, scones, cookies, cupcakes), Grits, Silver Dollar Pancakes, Sausage, Eggs, Bacon, Fried Chicken, Home Fries, Carved Beef, Gravy and Biscuits, Salad Bar, Crab Legs, Oysters, Macaroni and Cheese...that's just a little over half of the items. lol

Anywho...Everything was absolutely AMAZING! I will be back soon! Oh...Service was great! I wish I could remember my server's name. Overall...A+"}
{"text":"We've been meaning to have dinner or brunch here for quite a while, but just never got around to it.  We finally bit the bullet and went last night, as they're part of Restaurant Week.  Of all of the menus available, this one spoke to us the most.
We arrived and were greeted and seated promptly.  We were surprised when we found out that a drink was included on top of our 3 course meal, and we both enjoyed  a glass of red wine.  They have a nice beer selection, with 5 or 6 Charlotte beers on tap (NoDa, Birdsong and Triple C) and 15-20 bottles.

On top of that, seasoned popcorn (nummers) and a deviled egg.  The deviled egg was okay, but it ain't grandma's! It tasted \"right\", just not up to the standards you would expect at a southern Sunday lunch.

For apps - Fried oysters on top of a slice of pineapple with a sliver of jalapeno. Good, not great.  Sweet Potato Soup with a chunk of chorizo.  Very rich and delicious. We would order again in a second!

For main course, I had the CAB Hangar steak with sweet potato/blue cheese gratin and my lady had the Pan-Seared Scallops with oven-roasted sweet potatoes, caramelized Brussels sprouts, red wine bloomed cranberries.

Both were incredibly tasty.  Both would be ordered again and I will recommend this place to any well to do attorney who wishes to treat a group of co-workers to a nice dinner!

We are on a bit of a Brussels Sprouts kick as of late, and these did not disappoint. Charred to perfection and seasoned well too.

To surmise, we'll be back and in the words of Biggie Smalls \"If you don't know, now you know!\""}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriends are here for brunch neither of us has ever been here...very nice ambiance, hostess was nice and welcoming they are open from brunch from 11-3 and they hv a buffet for $23 only one person in our party got the buffet and she said it was jus ok I got the salmon Benedict deliciousness would definitely recommend give that 5*. Another friend got the French Toast it was great as well. Another friend got the tacos and she said they were good...Our waitress was fantastic as well very attentive. Would definitely highly recommend this restaurant will hv to come back for dinner one day also they close at 3 and open back up for dinner at 5..."}
{"text":"I always recommend Nan & Byron's when asked about good Charlotte restaurants. My husband and I keep coming back here. The ambience and style is great and love the outdoor seating option. One of our favorite things is the popcorn starter. So delicious and unique. We've had the meatloaf, pan roasted chicken, steaks, and an amazing poblano cheese dip starter that is no longer on the menu. Never a bad meal and always nice service!"}
{"text":"My wife and I made our first visit for lunch.   Arrived early,  seated promptly and server was pouring water within 2 minutes.   We split a club sandwich and mohito fries with a great dip and it was delicious.  Plus,  they offer Coke products!   My wife said it was the best sandwich she ever had!   Fair prices,  professional server,  casual atmosphere and exceptional food put this restaurant at the top of our recommend list."}
{"text":"Service was mediocre, food was hit or miss.  The chicken was well seasoned & juicy. The signature farmhouse burger was overpowered by the barbecue sauce. Although this isn't a kids restaurant they do have a kids menu - but the owners/chef don't seem to know what kids like. Overall our experience was OK, but we won't be back."}
{"text":"This place was great while it was still fairly new as I went 4 times within the first year it was open. I'm assuming it closed because not everyone felt the same way? Never had a bad experience. Not sure what happened to the South Blvd. location, but I definitely miss it. The filet w/ potatoes and red wine reduction was outstanding. Craft cocktails were always solid as well."}
{"text":"Nan & Byron's is confusing to me and I'm not sure they know what they want to be either.  They seem trapped between trendy bar and upscale dining.  Our server was very good, our reservation on point, and our table all ready.  But, upscale dining was a big miss.

The food was mostly a disappointment for our party of 7.  The ribeye was universally condemned as a poor cut and overcooked with many crying foul that it was a hanger steak masquerading as a pricier cut.  My daughter's pork chop entrée was returned as overcooked and missing ingredients  (the replacement was fine).  My scallop dish was tasty, however for a $25 entrée the scallops were small and few.

With so much great dining in the area, N&B is not even in the running.  Maybe if I want some popcorn and a beer I'll pop in."}
{"text":"As a frequent 5 Church patron I'd be waiting on this place to open for awhile. Lot's of hype and chatter went on for months about Nan and Bryon's. The good news is the hype was real! 

Really enjoyed the food, atmosphere, cocktails, and decor. Pricing was slightly less then 5 Church which is nice. Quality of food and portion size is spot on. 

A must visit Charlotte restaurant."}
{"text":"Went for business dinner and was extremely disappointed. Ordered Farmhouse Lemonade, their signature drink, and while tasty it was a very light pour. I'm a complete lightweight and didn't notice anything after 2 rounds.

Service was polite but extremely slow. No complimentary popcorn. Few patrons, waited over an hour for food while surrounding tables were served. Food was cold. We all tried each other's dishes. The mushroom soup was viscous and dirty tasting. I've never had a mushroom soup that I couldn't eat. It was like drinking gravy. Waitress didnt ask why it was untouched. The meatloaf was bland and looked old. Vegetables were frozen peas and carrots out of the bag, seriously...they couldn't cut up their own carrots. Mashed potatoes were gummy. My boss didn't finish her scallops but didn't say anything. Ordered a side of grits, there was no salt in them and they were gummy instead of creamy.

The staff seemed fine. I think the problem is in the kitchen. They don't know how to manage the orders and the food isn't fresh or seasoned appropriately. I hope they fix this, but I'll never know. There are so many better places in Charlotte to eat.

Oh, and grammatical errors on printed menu...."}
{"text":"Ah-choo...from the girl who cannot stop eating the complimentary popcorn laced with Cayenne seasoning. Despite the fact that I kept sneezing, I couldn't keep my hands off of it either. Nan and Byron's is the newest, coolest restaurant in South End. 

They have a great menu filled with comfort food, which just makes you feel like you're eating a piece of home. Although my home never served up portobello stuffed mushrooms...I ordered that with a side of peas and carrots. Delicious! Hubs ordered the chicken and stopped talking to me over dinner because he couldn't break away from the meal. 

Parking is free (like I keep reading from their tweets). However, the parking can be a challenge, unless you are early birds like we are. It's rather small and if the entire restaurant is full you'll need to find parking elsewhere. When we were leaving other patrons were desperately looking for a place to park. Quickly eyeing us leaving a prime  front-row spot, they stuck the car in reverse, and was happy as a lark to get our spot. 

Noise level can get quite rowdy. It's an intimate, rustic setting, but not much to absorb the chatter from all the busy tables. We visited during a holiday party time and it got quite loud. Thankfully we were at the end of our dining experience when the party got into full swing.  

Looks like there is great potential for when the weather is nice for a couple of outdoor tables in the front. Nice. Looking forward to returning and trying out the rest of their menu."}
{"text":"Overpriced, small portions. I ordered the Greek salad. It was the worst food I've ever had. The dressing was bitter and it tasted like I would imagine dirt taste. Another member of my group also ordered that salad and they hated it too. Someone else in the group ordered the shrimp and grits. He said it was good but portion was so small he left hungry.  The other person with us got the pork chops. He liked his food.  He was the only one of the 4 that was completely satisfied with his selection."}
{"text":"Food was good, nothing spectacular on the small menu, just traditional comfort food, nothing to really rave about.  Atmosphere was ok, pretty loud in the main dining room and tables were seated very close together so everyone was trying to talk over the tables near by.  Service was great!  Overall it was a good dinner, but probably wouldn't go back for more nor do I feel the need to try other items on the menu that I didn't get to try this time."}
{"text":"Let me first off say the food is really good. The only drawback to this place is the tables are VERY close together and it is very loud. Would not be a great place to bring to have conversation."}
{"text":"Did brunch at Nan & Bryon's.  Basic brunch w/seafood at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"This is the second time to Nan and Byrons, both for brunch.  The first time was phenomenal, today was the exact opposite.  Had a reservation for 1:15 and did not get sat... ever.  Ended up eating at the bar (BARTENDERS WERE AWESOME).  I have managed restaurants in New York City prior for 7 years and have never had an owner place the blame on patrons.  After inquiring about when we would be sat the third time.. the owner \"apologized\" and by that i mean said sorry but you did add two people to your reservation.... In fact what he had done was place the blame on us.. at this point we had been waiting an hour past our reservation time.  He offered no drinks, no table, no solution.  Will not be returning and will be spreading the word throughout the race community as well."}
{"text":"I had date night at N&B tonight. We enjoyed the meatloaf and petite filet. My steak was overcooked by the manager quickly fixed it and offered to take care of a round of drinks and a dessert. We sat in a cozy booth that felt quite intimate. I was slightly confused on the service. Our waiter rarely came to our table, the manager and \"back server\" interacted with us more. We hope the tip was split with them."}
{"text":"Service is great here. Goes well with the whole southern hospitality theme. Food is alright. They brand themselves as an upscale brunch place but the presentation of the food not! 

Tip: Try and avoid ordering a cappuccino here."}
{"text":"Not impressed with this restaurant. I rarely ever give a one star and here are the reasons why Nan and Byron's is getting this type of a review.

Walked in and greeted by the hostess. Little early and went over to the bar. Ordered a Crystal Cosmo which was okay. Other friend joined us and ordered a water. Bartender never brought her glass of water.

Hostess comes over and says our table is ready and to check out at the bar. Ask bartender for the tab, he says he has other thing to do. He get a drink for someone else and then he takes chair and moves it and gets preoccupied with other things and not with the customers at the bar area. I am still waiting to be checked out. Hostess comes back 2nd time to seat us but I haven't been checked out. Another staff member brings me the check. I give her cash. She short changes me. 

We finally get seated. There were no complementary popcorn. We split the Signature Taco. The Beer Braised Pork was dry and had no flavor stacked with tons of arugula. As for the Taco- it is a flour tortilla- you would think it be soft but it was hard. Someone over cooked it. Asked the waitress is the taco suppose to be this hard when the other one is soft? She said that is how it is and then she says let me see and takes it and brings back the item in a softer taco shell. 

Ordered the Prince Edward Island Mussels- Not crazy about the sauce which is like Campbell's Tomato Soup. Was not my cup of tea. Have had way way better Mussel's than the ones they serve here.

We decided not to go for desert for we were not pleased nor impressed by the food this evening. One of my friends, who was here like last November said they were not on their game tonight. She did not eat her Brussel Sprouts because it was not seasoned. 

My friend asked the waitress for the check. She never came with the check. Then, my other friend asked for the check again.

This place is not even busy. Looks like more staff here than patrons.

Tonight, the food and the service was not good. Wait staff takes forever to bring you the check. No smile or customer service. The prize goes to the hostess and reception area, who greet the customers, seats them and says goodbye after the meal. They did a great job.

We will not be back. Too many restaurants in Charlotte to select from."}
{"text":"I stopped in here for brunch one day with my husband and could not believe the spread for the buffet they had. I was sick that day and not feeling like eating a whole lot or I would have gotten it for myself. The buffet included a drink such as a mimosa or bloody mary and of course the entire buffet which had crab legs! The price was $21 which is good when you consider one drink is about $8-10 anyway. My husband ordered it and went back several times. They had a great selection of items. I ordered an omelette and the hash browns were delicious with good spice. 
I can't wait to go back for dinner one night."}
{"text":"Went here during restaurant week. Lots of things to like about this place: valet parking, pleasant hostess, nice decor. It was too cold, but they appear to have a pretty sizable patio area which I'm sure would be great in warmer months.

I had the sweet potato soup to start, which was topped with sour cream. I wouldn't mind the sour cream as a decorative glaze, but it was entirely too much. Made the soup too bitter when mixed. For the main course, I asked for the Wagyu flank, medium rare. Definitely came out much closer to rare. I didn't send it back because our server was pretty busy, so didn't want to be a pain in the neck. But yeah, they definitely undercooked it. The dish comes with a sauteed broccolini which really underwhelmed in terms of taste. No butter or salting. Sort of just plain broccoli.

I think this place is close to four stars, but needs some improvements. If they can cook the meat closer to order, not overdo it on the sour cream, and add some taste to the broccoli, I'd add a star. Overall, though, a nice spot to grab a bite."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were really excited to come to Nan and Byrons from the great reviews. Unfortunately,  our overall experience was not exactly what we hope it to be. Upon entry, we were not greeted. When we were sat the hostess was very rude. Our waitress was not very detailed in the fact that our table was not given popcorn, a pitcher of water when every table had it. 

The appetizer for myself was crispy calamari. It was very spicy. I personally do not enjoy calamari with tentacles.  My boyfriend got the tomato soup that tasted like ragu pasta sauce. 

My main course meal for myself was the Chicken Pot Pie. This was luke-warm but good. My boyfriend got the hanger steak which was also luke-warm and the Mac and cheese was burnt. 

Both desserts ( Nan's banana pudding and Smores Cheesecake) came out warmer then it should of been.

We even had a table next to us that agreed with everything we said while we were leaving. 

Overall, we felt rushed, we finished our three course in 40 mins! 

We don't believe we will return."}
{"text":"Service was spotty and perhaps the staff was overwhelmed by Queens Feast reservations (this place was not packed) but our server didn't understand the menu and how to add drinks on our tab. 

The popcorn they put on the table was burnt and the tomato soup was very very salty.

My pork chop dish was way undercooked (pork should not be raw in the middle nor on the ends. I sent it back and they cut off the ends that were raw and bought it back. Sad.

I ordered a side of Mac and cheese for the table and it never came. I ordered a second cocktail and the confused waitress said it would not be at the special pricing so what other liquor would I like in the tropical mule, rum was my answer and charge me for the regular cocktail. This place didn't even promote special cocktail prices on their Queen Feast menu so maybe the staff should just say: if you would like a cocktail off the invisible QF menu its regular pricing. Easy 

The ppl next to us were in mid entree and our desserts were delivered to their table. Just a big old cluster fuck. I've had my eye on this place for awhile and it was disappointing to have this experience. One and done."}
{"text":"Small portions for the money, plates look plain and without any garnish. A wanna be upscale restaurant should not compromise on quality or presentation. Having flies around brunch buffet only topped the experience."}
{"text":"Did you say farm to table?  Why yes I did.  Did you say indoor seating that slides open on warm days? Why yes I did. Did you say they use interesting flavors and textures on their menu like chicken wings glazed with ghost peppers in honey mustard sauces and crispy cornmeal fried beat sandwiches topped with a avacado and boursin cheese on a brioche bun? What about the timid folks what will they eat? Burgers, steak, meatloaf,  chicken, ok. What's for dessert?  Fudge brownie topped with coffe ice cream and Ancho chocolate Chile sauce. OK. When can we go?"}
{"text":"Expected so much more! We had been wanting to try this place for a while... So disappointed! We went for a quick dinner with our daughter and were shocked at the quality & quantity of food for the prices. 

We dine out frequently and certainly do not mind higher prices when it's worth it. Our meals were tiny and only what I'd call average. 

Example: the scallops- one of the most costly items on the menu. Came with 3 scallops. And they weren't prepared well. 

Example: the crab cake appetizer. Came with 2 very small crab cakes. Tasted more like breadcrumbs than anything else. 

The only positive thing I can say we're the signature drinks were tasty and fair priced."}
{"text":"There isn't one thing I can complain about here. I'm grateful to have a new addition like Nan and Byron's in Charlotte. 

I recently had brunch at Nan's, which was exceptional. The smorgasbord was heavy on goods like crab legs and shrimp with grits and low on boring pastries. I sat outside on the patio, which is super cool with its funky garage doors. I've also had dinner here, which is just as great. I am absolutely in love with the beet burger, a refreshing treat for a pescetarian like me.  

All of the staff members are young, friendly and attentive. Definitely not any stuffiness here. So, if you're looking for superior food, a cool atmosphere and a trendy crowd/staff without the pretentiousness, you've stumbled upon the right spot. Can't wait to go back for brunch or dinner soon. P.S. - Don't miss the peppedew peppers as an appetizer. They are the most heavenly, creamy bites of deliciousness."}
{"text":"Nan & Bryon's reminds me of a cute spot you'd find in the West Village of NYC or in Austin, TX. It's cozy, and is very different than most of the other South End restaurants. It's 5Church's sister restaurant, so expect to see some similar ingredients, but the asthetic is VERY different. Whether sitting at the bar, or in a table in the main room, its cool vibe and comfortable atmosphere is great.
Wednesday nights to Saturday nights are crazy, so make sure you make reservations! They're open 7 days a week, including a brunch menu (that will soon transform to a brunch buffet..think Heist Brewery). The portions are huge, and you get Cayenne spiced popcorn to start. Like many places in South End, it's more on the casual side. They're known for their comfort foods, and additions of spice (like siracha or jalapeno) in their menu options.

Drinks to try: Jalapeno Margarita, South End Gin, Refashioned
The Jalapeno Margarita is topped with their signature Grand Marnier \"cadillac foam\"...which I would basically like to just pour in my mouth.

Food to check out: Beet Burger, Chicken

Sides: Winter Roasted Brussel Sprouts (if they have them, they're a special option off the menu), Mac & Cheese

I'll be honest, I'm a past employee from Nan's, but wouldn't write this review in bias. However, from knowing all of the  \"behind the scenes\" action, I can tell you that the service expectations are higher than many restaurants around Charlotte. Management trains staff to be fully knowledgable on the product and service standards, and it absolutely shows. Servers and bartenders live and breathe the menu, so if you have any dietary questions/restrictions, be sure to tell them!"}
{"text":"This is a cool little spot tucked away in the midst of the rising condos and apartment complexes that are starting to dominate the South End.  It's easy to miss but has ample parking and valet service is available as well.

The restaurant is in what (I think) was an old auto body shop.  They did a really nice job of modernizing it and taking advantage of the charm that the vintage look brings.  Very hip, eclectic atmosphere.

In the few times I've been here, I've tried a variety of things.  Most recently, I got the pork chop which is one of the more popular items.  It comes with a mustard sauce on top and sitting on a bed of grits.  The chop was good but the sauce was overwhelming and I had to scrape it off to even enjoy it.  I'm a big fan of spicy mustard but they just completely over-sauced it.  

There are some good drinks - try the refashioned if you like bourbon.  Very tasty!

Desserts are pretty good and include: banana bread pudding, pumpkin cheesecake, warm brownie with coffee ice cream on top.

All in all, this place has a lot of potential but hasn't quite reached it yet.  It's good,  but it could be great.  I look forward to seeing if they are able to work on stepping it up a little bit in the preparation of the dishes.  They recently revamped the menu so this appears to be a focus for them."}
{"text":"EPIC! Every time I go there it's EPIC. Nothing but great food. It's a must go to place in Charlotte. Hands down some of the best food in the city. Nothing but love for this place and the person I fell in love with there."}
{"text":"Have only been here for brunch. Price of an entree and 1 drink is about the same as the entire buffet which includes a bloody or mimosa (no brainier). That being said, if you go here you will eat too much. 

Typical American food brunch with some prime rib and (cold) shrimp and crab legs. Quality wise I wasn't overly impressed for a $22 brunch, probably won't bring here again, but nice to check it off the list. 

Most people make reservations so it will be really hard to go with a group without one. (Again, speaking about brunch.) The bar was open when I went so we just sat there without a reservation. 

Keep in mind, Sunday's in the South= no drinks before noon. I always forget that."}
{"text":"Great local spot near uptown Charlotte.  I have been here for lunch and dinner - both really yummy. The deviled eggs are delicious - I can't resist anything truffle oil!  And the kitchen sink salad is the jam."}
{"text":"So I returned to Nan's for the first time for dinner since the opening weekend (I frequent the brunch quite often and love it as much as the Saturday night drinks and dancing) and once again, I was NOT disappointed.  

I went on Friday night and the weather was quite awful, so I didn't think it would be that busy.  I was wrong and it was packed! Despite this, we were seated very quickly and the service was awesome every step of the way.  The manager even came over the personally check on how our evening was going.  I started with the arugula salad which was amazing.  I decided to take a leap of faith and try the beet burger (I've never had a beet burger before) and I'm so glad I did!!  The beet was perfectly flash fried and the mac and cheese side was to die for! I washed it all down with a Nightshade martini, which I highly recommend.  It is delicious and so fresh tasting! And I was quite surprised, but I finished my meal with a cup of coffee and I was one of the best cups of coffee I've had - I need to find out what kind it is!

I will definitely return for dinner and can't wait to try the other menu options!"}
{"text":"Just went last night and was more than willing to give the restaurant the benefit of the doubt being that it just opened. However, that benefit was not even needed! Service was spectacular, came out quickly, and the food was simply SPECTACULAR. 

I am allergic to corn so I couldn't eat the popcorn that comes out before the meal, but my husband said it was simply AMAZING - the right seasonings. Nice touch! 

The food was GREAT and completely reasonably priced. Well worth it! The chips are great as a side, and the fries were good too. 

We live nearby so we walked and can't comment on the parking, but there is always parking nearby if you don't want to valet. You just have to be willing to walk maybe, oh, 50 feet. 

The drinks looked AMAZING and I can't wait to go back and try them.

Overall, definitely coming back. Great experience, the apps looked spectacular and the restaurant seems really well run too. If it's this good early on I'm so impressed."}
{"text":"Such a disappointment. My boyfriend and I came here for the first time during restaurant week. We went at 5:45 to avoid crowds. When we got there, we were seated at a two top with very uncomfortable chairs, so I asked if we could sit at the booth side. We were told that we couldn't because every table was reserved, but by the time we left only half the restaurant was full. Immediately we felt rushed by the wait staff. We were pressured to order quickly and eat even quicker. Each course was brought before we had a chance to finish eating. The food was so heavily salted and seasoned that it was hard to eat. The whole time, we felt as if we were being rushed through. Walking in the door, eating a three course meal and getting the check took 38 minutes. The whole time, at least 5-8 waiters and waitresses stood in the back chatting and hanging out. It was so uncomfortable seeing this as I was eating. Overall, we could not enjoy the experience because we were being rushed through. We spoke to the couple at the table next to us afterwards, and they felt the exact same way. Big disappointment."}
{"text":"It's hard to decide what to eat when everything sounds so creative and delicious. I settled on the scallops with Brussels sprouts while my husband got tuna with tofu and edamame. We both liked out dishes but agreed the scallops were better. The cocktails Are just as tasty as the good, I highly recommend starting with one such as the re-fashioned or dancing cranberries. While the food isn't mind blowing - it is pretty good and the service and atmosphere make the experience even better. Definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"First time here. They really gave the old Vinnie's a complete new look. Decor fits the menu. Bar service was good. Initially service at the table started a little slow but he picked up the pace through the meal. The food was good. Nothing to complain about, just wasn't \"over the top, gotta get back there really soon\" in my opinion."}
{"text":"Five stars for the service!  We have the most bubbly server ever!  Super sweet and made great suggestions since it was our first time here.  We came with the kids and sat outside but what a cute place with whole American goth theme going on.  Popcorn instead of bread? Sure, thank you!  A nice little touch.  My husband and I both had the gin cocktail with the cilantro syrup(can't remember the name of it) and it was delicious and STRONG!  We started with the mussels and sweet chili wings.  The mussels were okay but not the best version of prince Edwards islands I've ever have.  The wings weren't the best either.  The chicken tasted as if it were fried early that morning then reheated and tossed in sauce .  The kids were happy with their pasta and burger especially after being told the burger was cooked in bacon fat!  My husband had hanger steak maybe which he was impressed by and au gratin potatoes which he didn't eat.  After the server noticed he wasn't eating them she asked if she could replace them and he opted for the Brussels sprouts which were perfect!  My scallops were HEAVEN.  Cooked to perfection with creamy potato puree and Brussels and the mandarin oranges added a NICE FLAVOR!  The kids went for dessert which they were not impressed by but honestly I don't think these desserts were super kid friendly and I wish we would have been warned about that.  Nan's Oreos were homemade cookie sandwiches with almost bitter cookies and the plate was decorated with some sort of whipped beer concoction.  The s'mores cheesecake was okay but finished with what tasted like Hershey's syrup.  All in all I would def come back because I really enjoyed my food and drinks but maybe I will leave the kids at home"}
{"text":"I met a large group here and had terrible service. Isn't that where we should start? Let's face it, if they had the best food I had ever eaten maybe I wouldn't have written this review but bad service trumps good food any day!
Had reservations for 7:30. Didn't get seated until after 8pm! It took probably an hour and half to get our dinner. I had the pork chop. They went out of their way to notate how it was cooked \"Medium\".  I don't know what the standard is on a piece of Pork, so I just assumed that would be cooked just right. Not too under cooked or overcooked. It was overcooked. Still had good flavor, but definitely not what I would consider medium. 
The jalapeño poppers were good, but not great. Overall I really feel like the service really ruined it for me. I may go back and if I do I will update my review if I have better results."}
{"text":"I liked Nan and Byron! It was so loud in there so you had to yell to your seatmate but besides that I really liked the vibe and decor of the place. The service was really awesome and someone was always there when we needed them either to fill our water or to check in on how things were going. 

I loved the popcorn they had out at all the tables. Since I was starving it was great at holding me over until the appetizers made their way over. We started off with the deviled eggs which I wasn't a huge fan of but my dining companion loved them. We got the poppers based on the recommendation of Nikki W and they were really good! For dinner we split the meatloaf which was tasty along with the cheesy macaroni and cheese goodness that we got as a side.

For dessert they had a brownie sundae with peanut butter ice cream. That thing did not disappoint. It could have used more ice cream but when one of the waiters noticed we had a lot of brownie left he even offered to bring us more. I really appreciate that level of service!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious!! And the waitstaff was friendly but it threw us off when they brought our red wine out in a water glass. It didn't seem to fit the ambiance for the rest of the experience. I ate the meatloaf and was very satisfied. I also love that they bring popcorn out as a starter to everyone."}
{"text":"I really, really wanted to like this place more. For some reason or another, I've had Nan & Byron's on my list of \"must-try restaurants\" for a while and with them participating in Charlotte Restaurant week this Summer, I decided this would be a good opportunity.  My friend made reservations for early Saturday evening (7-18-15) and we had no trouble getting parking spots in their limited parking lot. 

The exterior really feels reminiscent of a small firehouse (which I believe the space was before it was turned into a restaurant) and has a very intimate and modern feel on the inside. Our waitress greeted us and let us know about our meal options. We both ordered from the restaurant week menu (which included an alcoholic beverage of your choice) and munched on the complimentary popcorn basket. I really liked the popcorn, it has a subtle spicy kick to it.  I ordered a glass of Malbec and started off with the crispy oysters. The oysters are each served with slices of jalapeno and pineapple. A nice balance of heat and sweet. Unfortunately, the oysters are quite bland on their own and I didn't find them to be that crispy. My friend ordered the sweet chili wings and I much preferred those over the oysters.

For the main entrée, I went with the wagyu flank steak. It was served with \"crushed\" aka mashed potatoes and broccolini. I was HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED in the steak. I asked for it medium and it was inconsistently warm throughout. Lukewarm steak is just a no-no. The potatoes were the warmest thing on the plate and they had nice flavor thanks to the scallions that were mixed in. The broccolini was just....there. I had a few pieces of it but I much prefer regular ol' broccoli.  My friend ordered the filet mignon and she was also disappointed in her meal.

For dessert, I went with the key lime tart. Of course the one thing I don't take a picture of ends up being the best part of the meal. This was a winner. I looked at their menu and it doesn't appear to be a regular offering of theirs. They should change that right now. It's the perfect summer dessert. The tart was served with blackberry sauce and the balance of the acidic lime and sweet blackberry worked so well together. Not too heavy and nice light flavors. I could've probably eaten an entire dish of that.

The service was great and very considerate but I was so disappointed in the overall meal, especially since I had been looking forward to eating there for quite some time. I'm going to blame the business of restaurant week for the meal quality and I hope to return to different experience trying out their brunch/lunch menu."}
{"text":"First time trying this place. I was very excited reading after the menu online. Parking is ridiculous. Very small spaces and not nearly enough. The restaurant is beautiful. Decor is chic rustic and really classy. The staff is great. Everyone was warm and friendly and checked on us often. Now the bad news. My party of 5 ordered a diverse selection that was more misses than hits. The deviled eggs seemed past their prime. The egg whites were tough.  The pimento cheeses dip is good and a little spicy but the toasted bread was cold and way over toasted. The wings were good but the portion is small. The tomato soup is inedible and more like marinara sauce than soup. The seared tuna was very good. The pot pie is interesting. It is deconstructed. The roasted chicken is very good and the gravy has a nice flavor. The 'pie' is more like a large doughy dumpling with no flavor. The veggies were basically raw. So crunchy I don't think they were even heated before they were put on the plate. The banana pudding is not pudding at all. It is sliced bananas and whipped cream in a tart. Nothing fancy or worth having again. Not a place I would recommend."}
{"text":"Really great variety here. Had the Spicy Bloody Mary - Amazing! Biscuits were so good. Buffet was clean, neat and had a great variety. Pleasantly surprised. I'm definetly  going back."}
{"text":"I really really really wanted to like this place, and I've been excited to finally try it.  The fella and I went on a Tuesday night and thought with the day (random Tuesday before Thanksgiving), time (8:00 pm) and weather (ungodly rain), it might be a little less crowded.  We were wrong.  Since I really did want to like this place, I'm going to start with the bad stuff so I can end on a good note.

THE BAD

Parking: The parking is still as annoying as it was with Vinnie's.  There's a valet, but he just directed me to a space coming available in the lot.  The fella wound up two blocks away in a random lot.

Hostess: We checked in at 7:55 for our 8:00 reservations.  The hostess acknowledged us, and then ignored us to answer the phone, which is one of my biggest restaurant pet peeves - always deal with paying customers first before answering the phone.  So, we checked in with the host.  Then the hostess seated two other groups.  We went back to the host, who apologized for the hostess and finally seated us.

Seating: If there are two of you, you'll get stuck a two-top table in the middle of everything and everyone.  The fella got bumped into countless times by waiters and patrons alike.  It's a flurry of activity, and it's cramped quarters.

Wine Glasses: So, the wine glasses look exactly like the water glasses but just a tiny smidgen smaller.  The fella wasn't impressed with the lack of wine glasses or the fact that the wine came in a glass that wasn't bowl-shaped.  He was even less impressed when the waiter accidentally refilled his wine glass with water.  Considering there was about one-fourth of the wine left, I was the least impressed (as the bill payer) when there was no comp on the wine... seriously?!?!  

THE GOOD

Food: Believe the hype about the peppedew popper appetizer ($5.50).  They're sweet and cheesy and delicious.  The meatloaf ($14.50) with sriracha ketchup was a great spicy twist on an old favorite.  (However, the mac & cheese and baked beans sides were just okay, and I didn't love that everything was stacked since my baked bean sauce kept getting mixed in with my meatloaf ketchup.)  The fella got the chicken ($14), which was a little dry but had a nice kick, and the slaw and mashed potato sides were excellent.

OVERALL

The fella has already said he'll never go again.  I'd try it once more just hoping that tonight was an off night, but... ugh.  At least get some real wine glasses!  Talk about squashed excitement."}
{"text":"I got the famous beet burger. Really great option for vegetarians, it was really good. Not a huge fan of fried stuff but I still liked it. I sat outside with my pup on a pretty day."}
{"text":"Awesome lunch on the patio on a beautiful sunny day! I've been anxious to try this restaurant since it opened! I knew going in I had to try the beet burger! Unique and delicious! My husband doesn't like beets but he tasted my burger and liked it enough to say he would order it sometime. It wasn't \"beety\" or earthy tasting. I had a hard time deciding on a side dish, but our waitress suggested the sweet potato waffle fries. They were good but too salty for my taste. I would order again but request less salt! My husband got the farmhouse burger and said it was good, but he felt bloated the rest of the day. Will definitely go back!! Yum yum!"}
{"text":"This is the second time that I've gone to Nan & Byron's, once when they first opened and the second with a large party. In this review, we'll focus on the large party experience. 

This past friday night I was put in charge of organizing the dinner plans for a friend's 30th birthday dinner. My biggest pain point was the large party reservation process. First, when my reservation increased to over 10 people, I had to get in touch with the catering sales manager. The hosts on the phone would not take my reservation as they explained to me \"they weren't allowed to\". No problem. I can talk to someone else, but then I was expected to get in touch with that person, not the other way around, well it kinda ticked me off. Insert first pain point of customer service irritation. The next day that I called to change the reservation, I was instructed that once again \"I\" needed to get in touch with sales, and then I was informed that I would have to sign agreement, put a credit card on file and pay a $10 cover for any no shows. I get it - no shows and changes in reservations flat out suck, they do. However, when the most expensive entree on the menu is less than $20, I find this process a bit tough to swallow. Exhibit B of pain point. 

Now, after getting in touch with catering sales manager, I will say that she was very timely, professional and accommodating with the process. Not sure if this was on done on her behalf, but in lue of having to split up our tables inside the restaurant, we took the chances of sitting outside. Since we were gambling all our dinner plans around weather circumstances, the large party booking process was dismissed. Guess what... it turned out to be a glorious Charlotte evening. One that would have been perfect for sitting in the sweet Carolina air. Guess where my party sat... inside. After all the muss and fuss of not being able to find a table inside, that's exactly where we ended up. Strike 3! 

Moving on to the actual dining experience, our server was a doll. He took good care of us, kept the drinks flowing and timing was good except at the very end, when it took a solid 30+ minutes for checks and all. Food was average, drinks were yummy and decor was fab as always, but I certainly walked away feeling like I had just taken a big ol' swig of bitters from behind the bar. 

All and all, I might swing by for a lunch if that's where a friend wanted to eat, but it probably won't be on my list of recommendations anytime soon."}
{"text":"We had a pleasant dinner here recently. The waiter was very nice and the food was delicious! We started with the Peppedew Poppers. They needed a little something extra, like maybe a bit of goat cheese or some spicy heat. But, I love peppers and they were perfectly crispy! We split the chicken and the pork chop. Both were really very good. The bacon & blue cheese popover that accompanies the chicken was flavorful and baked just right. The cheddar-jalapeno grits that accompany the pork chop... I could have eaten a bowl of them by themselves!"}
{"text":"Great specialty cocktails and even better food.  The beet burger is phenomenal and the pimento cheese dip appetizer is a great way to start the meal."}
{"text":"After one hour enjoying our lovely meal, we were asked to leave for an upcoming reservation. It was probably the rudest thing I've been asked from a restaurant ever. I've worked in hospitality for years and would never do that to a group of guests. Awful treatment means that I will never recommend or visit this place again. Ever. Never."}
{"text":"Went on opening weekend, valet told us \"good luck\" getting a seat w/o a reservation. There were 10 open tables!
First off, all their cocktails are $10 and I don't mind paying that for a good one, but they MEASURED each pour of alcohol in each drink. It would take me $100 to catch a buzz.
We got the mac and cheese (tasted like velvetta), chicken breast (very bland and dry), and recommended French dip (no).  The best part of the whole meal was the Wasabi dipping sauce for the fries (not saying much). I'm not one to write a bad review, but this place did not impress."}
{"text":"I went to dinner last night with 3 friends. It took a while for the hostesses to seat us (even though we had a reservation) and it was not at all overly busy when we arrived.  I did enjoy the atmosphere, the cocktail service was initially slow however they did pick up the pace when the appetizers and dinner started to arrive. We asked to be seated inside, which was great at first, but they opened the garage door shortly after we sat down and my friends ended up getting really hot... it is still summer here and we were not looking to sweat it out in a patio like setting. The drinks were good, food was good, atmosphere was good... Even with the mishaps on slow drinks and front staffing, I still give it 4 stars. We enjoyed our night regardless of the heat and I like their vibe."}
{"text":"Had been waiting for them to open for a few months after following their posts on FB, etc. Went there on a Friday night after them being open for only a week. I can say it lived up to my expectations.

The menu was somewhat limited, but what they had all looked good. They started the table out with some popcorn instead of customer bread, chips, etc. It was great. I believe it was just regular popcorn with a light sprinkle of cumin. Very subtle, very good.

We had the dry rubbed wings as an app, they were also very good. 

For entrees. we had the pork (pork shoulder) and shrimp (over pasta). Both were very good. The only possible negative is that the entrees ( at least some of them) don't come with any sides. The side looked good, but were ala carte.

Not to be left out were the drinks. They were quite interesting - more craft than your normal fare. My wife had the Nightshade (actually two) and I had a local craft beer. All good.

Service was quite good, especially for a brand new place. All the inevitable kinks were worked out.

Overall N&B's lived up to my expectations and is a welcome addition to South End. We'll be back regularly."}
{"text":"Nothing special here.  Went for Sunday brunch.  The buffet looked very delicious, I had an a la cart omelet that was very good, however nothing to write home about.  Service was rather mediocre as well.  Nothing horrible about this place, but nothing special either.  I will not go back, due to the abundance of better places in the area."}
{"text":"The brunch buffet is fantastic! From chilled shellfish to homemade pimento cheese to typical breakfast items like bacon and eggs, they have something for everyone. I'll def be back."}
{"text":"Last night, my friend and I ate dinner at Nan and Byron's to celebrate her birthday. It was my third visit and her first. (My first visit was actually on opening night.) We had a reservation and were seated immediately. I was glad we got one of the tables that's half booth since those are more tucked away than some of the other tables. Our server was there immediately to pour us water and bring the complementary seasoned popcorn.  

I had a sauv blanc I hadn't tried before - Frog Head I think - and it was really good. My friend had one of the craft cocktails that the server passionately recommended and she really enjoyed it. We had the deviled eggs appetizer, which were extra creamy and super delicious. I'm kind of picky about when restaurants try to get fancy with the deviled eggs, but these were just how I like them. For my entrée, I had the shrimp, which I'd had once before and it always delivers. It's shrimp on a bed of pasta sautéed with garlic, butter and wine. It isn't heavy at all and the butter/garlic flavor is just heaven. It's comfort food without being weighed down with a heavy cream sauce or some other such thing. My friend had the mushroom, which came on a bed of quinoa with two sides - she picked the corn and the mashed potatoes. She said it was really good. I'm not a mushroom person, so I didn't try it. 

Just like at their sister restaurant 5Church, I have had consistently satisfying visits to Nan and Byron's and will keep going back. I've sampled several menu items at this point and have been really happy with everything I've tasted. The complementary seasoned popcorn is always a fun munchie with which to kick off the meals. The only problem I have with it is how hard it is to decide what to get every time. 

I'm looking forward to the warmer weather to see what it's like when they open up the garage door that runs along the front. I also have yet to experience their patio seating."}
{"text":"Today was my second visit to N&B'S and I was more impressed my second go round then my first. Had their pan seared Sea Scallops with a fried green tomatoe with pan seared crab cake as my app. Finished it off with their smores cheesecake. Everything was great! Great service and great food. I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Not exactly the best experience. My wife and I walked into N&B's about 7:30 Thursday evening.  We didn't have a reservation and the wait was about 45 minutes.  Not a big deal. 

We went to the bar to have a drink for the wait.  My wife had a couple of the mixed drinks on the menu, which she said were delicious, and I said were expensive ($9 & $10). We also had some popcorn while we waited, which was pretty good.

We took our seat around 8:10.  First negative - the table was right in the middle of the crowded bar area where dozens of people were standing on top of us.  If we had known that would be the table, we definitely would have opted to eat at the bar 45 mins earlier.

Second negative - we sat at our table for 18 mins before the server even came to take our drink/food order. Once we placed the order, it took an additional 13 mins to get our drinks (31 mins after we sat down).  The food came relatively soon afterward.

My wife had the mushroom and I created my own burger.  We both agree that although the food was good, it was nothing we would recommend. It also seemed a little pricey for what you actually got. 

Overall, not impressed."}
{"text":"I am not impressed with this place at all. We ordered the mussel appetizer which tasted odd. Service was great and the manager took the appetizer back and came back to tell us that the chef agreed. However by that time I didn't want to try anything else so we finished our glass of wine and left."}
{"text":"Awkward server
Overly salty shrimp and polenta
Poached eggs on a Benedict that were served hard boiled
Under seasoned Benedict 
Big disappointment"}
{"text":"Decent Saturday brunch buffet with seafood. There were a lot of options including: crab legs, oysters, smoked salmon, eggs, grits, biscuits and gravy, bagels, fruit, bacon, sausage, and salads, etc. I'd probably like to try somewhere else out first before returning, as it was just okay here at N&B's. Nothing really stood out or was memorable."}
{"text":"Had dinner here for the first time last night.  Food was amazing.  Great drink menu and solid beer selection.  The beer menu is not vast by any stretch but the few they have are very good- lots of local brews too.  
Started out with deviled eggs and cheese dip apps. Eggs were good.  The cheese dip was unbelievable.  Couldn't stop eating it.  Had the Farmhouse Burger as my entree. Very good!  cooked perfectly- very rich burger so try not to eat eggs and cheese dip before you order the burger. Service was great

The decor was really cool.  I had flashbacks of the old decrepit Vinny's.  What an amazing transformation."}
{"text":"Went for late night, kitchen was still open at 11. Nice.

Food was ok, they were serving burgers and appetizers at that point. Fine by me. Nothing outstanding but no low points. Menu was trying really hard to be frisky, kind of like when your boring aunt makes a push to become the cool aunt.

The decor is so contrived and lame. This is the kind of restaurant that gets made fun of back in Seattle. It looks like they went into the sysco food systems catalog, opened to the chapter titled \"trendy 5 years ago\" and checked every item on the list. \"Free Idea: Decorate a restaurant with Edison bulbs?\" -Jesse Thorn (@JesseThorn) 

It's fine, just not especially good."}
{"text":"Not sure what's up with the other negative reviews. My wife and I went the other night and loved it. Service was great, staff was friendly and everything was wonderful overall. The food was delicious. I had the pork chop and it was awesome. It was cooked perfectly and the grits it came on we're hands down best grits I have ever had. We will be back."}
{"text":"Nan and Byron's is a nice place for some drinks and hang out with friends but I have to say that the food is mediocre and lacks a lasting impression on my taste buds. We ordered deviled eggs and chilled shrimp for appetizer and it was ok. The deviled egg was of creamy consistency but the chilled shrimp was rather bland. I got the salmon dish which was one of their well known dish but the salmon was bland as well. It was grilled with nice grilled marks but it was a little fishy. I did however enjoy the sautéed kale and potatoes that accompanied it. 

 The server was nice and patient in taking our orders for a party of 8 without fail as to forget anything we needed and was prompt in getting what we needed. We were there on a Thursday night and it was not crowded. 

At last, for dessert I got the strawberry shortcake. That was pretty good with fresh made sponge cake, strawberries and a light cream in between the layers. 

If I went back to nan and Byron's, it would be to get drinks and appetizers."}
{"text":"Tried Nan and Byron's today for brunch and was disappointed in all phases. 

First after being seated nobody came to our table until I went and asked the hostesses. We were seated around other tables being waited on and everyone working clearly saw we needed service. It was rather busy for Sunday brunch but they clearly had enough staff working at the time for the volume of people. For the rest of the meal, the waiter's attention was spotty at best and only checked on our table a few times. 

Moving on to the food, two in our party had the brunch buffet ($21 with a drink) and I ordered an omelette off the menu.  The waiter managed to spill coffee while filling a cup and walked off without attempting or offering to clean it up. We had to ask a nearby waitress at another table for something to clean it up. The impression I got from the two who ordered the buffet were disappointed with it being mediocre at best. The crab legs (selling point of the buffet) were overcooked and almost not worth the hassle or effort. The rest of the items were average and were on par with something you'd get from a mass catered event. Definitely not warranting of the $21 price. They were done with their second plates before I received my simple omelette with toast and home fries. The omelette was horribly overcooked and bland and they cut up sausage links (served on the buffet) to use in the omelette. I could have cooked a better one at home in 5% of the time it took to receive my plate. 

We also overheard/saw two other tables that had issues with their food or service and were being comp'ed or receiving discounts for their meals. Clearly there were multiple issues going on outside of just our table and experience. I am definitely puzzled why this restaurant was as busy as it was and with many positive reviews. 

I will not return."}
{"text":"This was the one pick of our restaurant week selections that I was most excited about. Loved the decor and the feel of the interior. We got there before the big crowd so it was laid back relaxed and pretty quiet. The servers were on top of their game and the courses were served and a perfect pace. There was no rush to get us in and fed and out. 
We had the oysters and the Cobb salad for starting course. That was the beast Cobb I've ever had anywhere. The oysters were good but were just odd to handle. The pineapple base they have is a great compliment to the heat of the Jalapeño.
Main courses.....we had the pan seared chicken and the NY strip. The chicken and green beans were perfectly cooked, the Gorgonzola popover was over cooked and rubbery, blueberry marmalade was good though. My honey's steak was good not great and the fries were a little dry. 
Desserts.....lord have mercy. Ok one of the reasons I wanted to put N&B's on the list of to do's was to try the banana pudding. Ate the whole flipping thing and dared my honey to take one solitary bite. Not really but yeah it was goooooood. I got a taste of his Key Lime tart, they aren't kidding about the tart part. Tart part...hahahaa sorry I thought it was funny. 
Anywho, the guy and I have decided that this place will def be a do over spot. Try it out the food is really good and the prices on the regular menu aren't all that bad any day."}
{"text":"Om nom nom. This place is great. We were here over the weekend for Charlotte Restaurant Week. It was our first visit and we were very impressed. The sweet chili chicken wings were the BOMB! The Wagyu and Hanger Steak were delicious, and the sweet potato & blue cheese gratin was incredible. We will definitely be visiting again soon!"}
{"text":"Waiting to try Nan and Byron's since I heard it was owned by the people from 5 Church, ( which I liked okay -thought it had potenial, but too pricey). We got there a couple minutes before 5 ( they open at 5PM) but there was quite a few people in the restaurant already and at least 6 people at the bar. We were the first people in our group of six. We had no reservations but assumed coming in that early we could eat a quick dinner. We were greeted by two hostesses, which we relayed our 'no reservation'  dilemma too and they said - no problem ...but then nothing. We stood there and looked at them and they finally said..\"We will not seat you till your complete party gets here\" Okay, so we went to the bar. Which had 4 bartenders behind it. It was a bar for around 12 people. Five already seated and drinking. My husband and I sat down...found a bar menu and waited...and  waited...and waited. Its a small bar, the bartenders were right in front of us, FOUR of them..no one acknowledged us ..at all. After about 15 minutes ( a long 15 minutes ) One of them said without any apology, \"What can I get you?\" We ordered a \"Reoldfashion\" off the menu, a  13.00 drink. It was good and we were very thirsty. The rest of our party arrived and we were seated. We ordered the Peppedew Poppers for our appetizer, they were good, not great. The Cayenne Sprinkled Popcorn was great! That is free and refilled on the table!  We all placed our orders for entrees. There was three orders of Fish and Chips and Two Beet Burgers and a Philly Cheese Steak. I ordered the Beet Burger because I had heard it was unique and good, Everything came fairly quickly. I was very disappointed in my \"BEET\" Burger, It was to be fried beets with cheese and avocado. It was two of the smallest little slices of BEET fried and layed on this big bun. It felt like I was eating a burger with out any kind of actual filling - just relish. If you are serving a BEET Burger then have some BEETS on it , not just a tiny couple of thin slices,  I would not recommend this. My husband's Fish and Chips were not cooked, batter was wet and fish was cold so it was taken back to the kitchen. It took over 25 minutes to get him something to eat. They brought his back out and it was cooked and okay. The very best thing they had were the Mojito Fries and the Sriracha Ketchup. Fries were crispy and covered with mint and lime and the ketchup, well I love Sriracha!! The manager did come to the table to say he was sorry about the fish for my husband, we said it took way too long, but nothing was done about it. I was hoping to like this place but I do think it was my last trip to Nan and Byrons"}
{"text":"My sisters and I had lunch reservation. We were greeted & seated immediately by a great staff. The food was undeniably delicious and we all loved our choices. A little bit on the pricier side but if you're okay with that, you won't be disappointed. I will definitely go to Nan & Byron's the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"In a lot of ways I was torn to make this a three star review but I can see the potential in the place.  First thing to know is the parking seemed a bit tough and probably will continue to be until the newness dies down.  They have valet but when the valet parking spots are literally right outside the front door it kind of defeats the purpose in my opinion.  I will just walk to my car at that point but Baku is the same way.  

The decor is super cool, they have done a fantastic job revamping the old into a new fresh space.  With metal ceiling tile in the color of cooper, everything has a brown tint and that gives people a warm and cozy factor.  There didn't seem to be a bad seat in the place either, no seating was obstructed from some sort of interesting view.

First to the table was popcorn....interesting choice of freebie but different and I like it.  The beer, wine and cocktail selections were bountiful and I ordered a beer.  It came out without a glass (it was a can), which is ok, but probably should have asked if I wanted one.  Secondly it could've been colder too.

I ordered deviled egg and chilled shrimp apps and then the prime rib with peas and carrots and coleslaw side.  All were great, the food was perfectly cooked and arrived in a timely fashion.  The raining deviled egg champ is still Queen City Q in my opinion though.  

Service was great and the tableside manner was certainly on point.  All in all, this will be a fantastic addition to the area and I certainly expect it to do very well for some time to come."}
{"text":"Craft cocktails that shine and american comfort food kicked up a couple notches, all in dark and cozy atmosphere that still feels energetic and bustling.  Hard not to attract a crowd with that kind of synergy.  As the \"new kid on the block\" with plenty of social media presence, expect reservations are necessary, unless you dig the roulette of an open bar seat.  While parts of a dinner experience here are great, others are a bit more unbalanced, but should get worked out as the kitchen and service staff settle in.

Table service begins with drinks and the delivery of popcorn to your table, seasoned with a little siracha salt and Sazon, a latin spice blend.  Great for munching, deceptively easy to continue devouring.  The staff will not let your basket get empty, so just be forewarned unconscious munchers.

The drink menu showcases a cocktail selection that is relatively brief but clearly thoughtful with ingredients like cilantro simple syrup and a host of muddled fruits.  Bitters also figure in a number of drinks.  I tried the Southend Gin and was quite pleased, as this gin-based drink rose above the sum of its parts to be both bright and refreshing, without being too sweet.  The wife went darker, with the bar's take on an Old Fashioned.  Again, the mix of fruits and rye whiskey was skillful and allowed each ingredient to play its role.  Clearly a sipping drink, as it was quite potent.  A small selection of local beers and a small collection of wines round out this menu.

To start, we tried the deviled egg appetizer, which comes 4 pieces to an order.  They were good, with a nice creamy texture to contrast against the firmness of the egg, but there was nothing really popping here.  Given the menu's prevalence of peppers, this felt a bit like an opportunity missed.  

For entrees we gave the meatloaf and the chicken a try.  Meatloaf was a manageable slab that benefitted from the kick of the siracha ketchup.  I had it served with a special side of brussel sprouts and the mojito fries, which are hand-cut fries mixed with mint and lime salt.  The chicken came with our picks of mac and cheese and a side of corn.  The chicken was a full quarter, with a smooth green sauce very sparingly dolloped along the edge of the chicken.  Sadly, it was a bit dry, especially compared to other local restaurants that focus on rotisserie chicken with South American spices and flavors.  Upon asking for additional green sauce to help with this, it was a bit of a poke in the eye to find a $.50 surcharge on the bill.

In both cases, the kitchen has a clear penchant for trying to present the protein on top of at least one of the sides.  Not sure why, other than the side portions (at least the mac and cheese and brussel sprouts) were quite small.  As in, \"we could count the number of pasta pieces served in the mac and cheese on 2 hands,\" small.  Same for the sprouts.  Both were quite well prepared, just disproportionately small, and this coming from a guy who strongly believes in quality over quantity.  The fries order was properly sized, but the very heavy amount of salt used made them hard to devour, even if I did like the flavor combo of lime and mint on my potatoes.  Unfortunately this was the weakest portion of the meal and is hopefully something that evolves as the kitchen gets its feet firmer on the ground.

Service was fast and expedient, and I like the \"all hands on deck\" approach whereby your food and drink are delivered by anyone who happens to be close when the order is pushed out from the bar or kitchen.  Even on a Friday night we got in and out in just under an hour.  If that sounds a bit rushed, you're right, though our server was always gracious to check in without being too pushy.  A slightly more relaxed pace would suit the vibe inside, though, and this is something that should settle down as time wears on. 

While this first menu might not be a true foodie stop for truly inventive cuisine, it shows there are many sparks of promise here and the kitchen is led by a team from which great things are expected.  So I certainly will come back, sample through more of the menu and then watch as things evolve.  The space is great and the drinks are, alone, worth a trip in.  With time, and a settling in, this restaurant will be an asset to the city and a welcome addition to dining and drink options in Southend."}
{"text":"I hate not giving this place a better review based on the food alone but I have to do it. The crispy beet burger is amazing! It's worth trying at least once. The issue I have is being overcharged. We ordered 2 cheeseburgers for the kids and got charged extra for cheese. We were also charged extra for ordering fruit as a side when it was listed on the kids menu as an option. It took us an additional 15 minutes to get the bill re-calculated so we could leave. The management needs to fix this. If things are extra, disclose it on the menu, or tell your waiters to disclose it."}
{"text":"I've been to Nan and Byron's several times and give them a solid 4 stars. Lunch is great - the meatloaf, tacos, French dip are all stellar. Their restaurant week menu was lovely. Brunch is a standard Charlotte brunch buffet, nothing too amazing there. But if you're looking for quality, no frills brunch convenient to the South End area - Nan and Byrons is worth a stop. As far as service goes: when they're good... they're GREAT, but it's been hit or miss in my experience."}
{"text":"High class service and delicious food! We had a wonderful server and awesome experience. We sat on the patio and enjoyed a delicious brunch of eggs Benedict and Classic eggs over medium.

Service was great; we were promptly seated and our server (Ryan) so beyond friendly and very knowledgeable about the restaurant and good. The buffet looked out of this world but we ordered off the menu, which was equally as good!

I would recommend this for a casual and enjoyable brunch on Sunday! Cheers!"}
{"text":"The food wasn't bad, but not for the price. The Chili fries (I forget what they called them) were awful. The Server was very slow, but he was very nice. The owner, or one of the owners, came by the table to see how we were doing, we told him our issues. He was Actually the rudest person we've ever come across, and solely because of him we will not be going back to Nan's nor to 5 church!  Definitely do not recommend it."}
{"text":"Great meal and the Valentine's menu was a good bargain.  The Lamb was cooked perfect and very flavorful.  Our server Meghan (sp?) was wonderful attentive enough to take good care of us and not too intrusive.  The scallops were tender, cooked perfect and tasted so fresh.   Crap cakes and tuna tartar were spectacular first courses.   Although my favorite was the Saint's Cut bourbon cocktail!!   Very lively spot and hard not to have fun."}
{"text":"We were in from out of town and reviewed several article for the best places to go for brunch. Nan and Byron's was one of the five or so that consistently were on all of the lists. They had a very good variety of items on the brunch buffet, including vegetarian options. The sweets were very good. Come of the salads on the average side. A couple of stir fry options that were there I can't comment on because they were near empty when we checked them out at 1130, and they were still next to empty not having been refilled the entire time of our stay. The best item on the buffet was the fried chicken to be honest. I really would have expected the buffet to have been a bit better than this for it to have been on the top ten of every list we looked at, perhaps it was an off day for them I don't know."}
{"text":"The rudest staff I've encountered at a restaurant! The hostess was quite possibly the rudest girl I've ever encountered!!! We did the brunch buffet at 12p which was a huge disappointment. They ran out of biscuits, deviled eggs, potatoes.... No fruit. What actually was on the buffet was cold and not good. Not worth the $25...."}
{"text":"This is a cool place and great for a date night.  The pork chops with cheese grits were fabulous!!! The Brussel sprouts were delicious as well. Call ahead and make reservations."}
{"text":"We chose Nan and Byron's for our Mother's Day brunch, and couldn't have been more pleased. The setting was casual enough for our 4-year-old to not be a distraction, the service friendly, and the food outstanding.

The buffet choices included a terrific selection of dry-rubbed chicken wings, shrimp n' grits, and meatloaf, along with fresh fruit, sliced salmon and much more. I found myself going back more often than I expected, and walked out completely satisfied. 

With a convenient South End location, spacious patio, generous beer selection and wonderful food, Nan and Byron's will definitely be on our go-to-list of great Charlotte restaurants."}
{"text":"We had heard good things about Nan and Byron's so we decided to try it out. To start out we ordered the SouthEnd Gin, Farmhouse Lemonade and the NightShade martini. The drinks were refreshing, though the favorite was the Lemondae. We started off with shrimp cocktail and spicy cocktail sauce. ($10.50 for 5 good sized shrimp). The Prince Edward mussels in a wine and crushed tomato cream sauce ($11) and the sushi grade tuna tartar ($10). Both were very good and I would order both as a main entree. One disappointment was that the mussels came with one thin slab of bread. There were 5 of us sharing the mussels, which had been suggested as a good appetizer to share. When we asked for more bread to soak up the delicious sauce, the waiter came out with one more slice. We then asked again for some more bread and they came out with a longer slice of bread (WTH????). We decided to take the sauce to go and get a loaf of bread on the way home because we were obviously going nowhere with this. (Management needs to rethink this - going to George's Brassiere for our favorite mussels there is no shortage of bread). There were plenty of mussels for the 5 of us to share and the Tuna Tartar was split by 4 of us. (Those 2 are the best deals for the money) The entrees that were ordered were the pan seared scallops, pan roasted chicken, seared tuna and grilled salmon and the kitchen sink salad. All of the entrees were very good - the blueberry and blue cheese popovers were amazing!! The roasted brussel sprouts were something we all could have passed on - not a great flavor and I like brussel sprouts. The seared tuna dish had 2 good size pieces of tuna, though our friend said he would have been happier with the tuna tartar. All in all we will be back and are hoping for one in Ballantyne!"}
{"text":"We wanted to try a new restaurant so decided on giving Nan and Byron's a try.  My girlfriend and I  found the atmosphere pleasant and the staff friendly (but very green).  Our food was served lightning fast which told me it had been precooked or partially precooked prior to us ordering.  When I pay $20 for a simple chicken dish, I at least expect it to be cooked fresh.  The chicken was very dry and flavorless as well.  Quite frankly, I found the entire meal to be flavorless, very boring and we felt rushed based on how quickly they brought us our food and bill.  For what you get, this place is way overpriced and very forgettable.  I guess I would go back if someone put a gun to my head but hopefully that won't happen for quite some time."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere and great mixed drinks. I have been here about five times and have never been blown away with the food and have always been disappointed with the price and small portions. I understand that meat is expensive, but is it really necessary to put child-sized portions of vegetables and other sides on the plate?

5 Church and Nan's is under the same ownership, and I would give the same review of both spots. These guys create great drinking places yet seem to fall short on the food."}
{"text":"Went here for a Sunday brunch and absolutely loved it. Ambience is very rustic, loud and for $22-ish (I forgot exact prices) you get their whole breakfast brunch buffet including things that you don't normally see such as crab legs, oysters, shrimp cocktails etc.  Of course, the regular breakfast items like pancakes, eggs, sausages etc are a part of it already (although I don't really care for those items since I'm not much of a breakfast type of foods girl).  I went there for a surprise birthday brunch ordeal -- and so with so much commotions, didn't really get to eat as much. lol :D 

Def would try to make another effort to go here again next time when I actually get to enjoy my meal.

Very busy spot for brunch so be prepared to wait. Also, this restaurant took over my beloved Vinnie's Raw Bar Seafood restaurant."}
{"text":"Quite disappointed in our visit today on Memorial Day. After being seated and given our glasses of water we received zero attention from the staff. I should preface this by saying they were most likely understaffed and weren't expecting customers on a holiday. We noticed several tables had been sitting for a long time with no food or drinks on the table. Then we saw a family sit down and didn't get any service for over 15min, they got up and left. We followed suit and left with no apology from the manager. I'd hope they can plan ahead next time for a holiday weekend."}
{"text":"Maybe we just didn't get it. Weird vibes, they're a mix of different things. We live by here and it's always super busy but maybe we just went on an off day. Food was okay, overpriced."}
{"text":"I'll echo what a lot of yelpers before me pointed out... Nan and Byron is really nothing special. In fact, it's a really expensive nothing special. I'll take average food at low prices and will champion outstanding food at high prices but just ok food that breaks the bank, well, sucks! I wish I had just taken you all at your word and skipped this one. 

We ate at the bar. The hostess was fairly unfriendly but the jovial bartenders made up for her. Beer selection on draught was pitiful. They had a really limited selection and shockingly 3-4 empty handles. So, they had the space for more beer and a wider selection, just choose not to? I'm confused. Anywho, due to the lack of good, craft beer, I ordered the sparking mojito. At $11, this was quite possibly the biggest rip off of the night. About 90% prosecco (a glass of prosecco would have only run me $6, btw) and 10% mojito, I was disappointed.  

We ordered a meat and cheese board and the pork spring rolls to start. Luckily we had a chance to make it through those before ordering anything else. The meat and cheese was fine. Nothing special but priced at $15+. The spring rolls, touted by the bar tender as \"outstanding\" were a serious let down. The appetizer cost $10. For 2 dry, bland spring rolls. That's $5 per spring roll for all the math majors out there. 

After realizing this place was not worth the money, we choose to pay out tab (over $50 for 2 drinks and 2 apps!) and leave. I found myself wishing we'd gone to just about any other spot on South or East Blvd. Lesson learned!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Hush Puppies as a Appetizer, the Classic Burger (medium well) and a Angry Orchard Beer (all for $21.64) not a bad deal. The food was great!!! It can get a little Noisy inside but don't let that stop you.....we made a reservation on Open Table which worked out great! I look forward to going back here again soon. Maybe for brunch"}
{"text":"Semi upscale but casual restaurant with really good food. Highly recommend the beet burger. Would be a great place for a first date, just be sparing with the cayenne popcorn.

The brunch buffet includes a mimosa, Bloody Mary, coffee, or juice. I think the buffet has the same items on the menu including typical breakfast dishes as well as crab legs and oysters for $23. We were told by the server that the buffet is the way to go since ordering a la carte can take 30 minutes. Next time I will happily wait for my food instead of getting the brunch buffet."}
{"text":"Fun lunch and not so crowded or noisy that you could not hear one another. Very pleasing experience.  Loved the atmosphere, and the cuban sandwich was great.  The starter popcorn that they offer is wonderful.  Wish I had the recipe!  Service was wonderful and the restaurant was very clean and we thoroughly enjoyed our visit.  Cleanest bathrooms I have seen in a restaurant!"}
{"text":"The decor is low-key, sedate.  I really like how the entrance is open and inviting.  They mentioned they are going to do a patio area going from the building out towards the street.  It sounds awesome, but parking is already a bit tight (though they do offer valet), so that might be an issue for some.

We were there early for a quick appetizer right after work and so it was quiet still.  I don't know that I'd be happy dining there when it's super crowded in the bar area.  Although there is a wall between the dining and bar areas, it is partitioned in a way there would still be a ton of noise.

We enjoyed the food and the servers and staff were all friendly and made us feel welcomed and comfortable.

The food selection seemed good with good wine selections."}
{"text":"NOTHING about Nan and Byron's is worth your time and money! I should have known when checking out the website, it makes no mention of a Chef on the  \"Review The Team\" tab.
Only the Business Owners are featured. 
Why? Because there is no Nan, no Byron, and definitely no Chef in the kitchen preparing your High Priced food!!! These 3 business owners are laughing all the way to the bank!  
Picture this...
*Valet parking, and then being seated IN A TENT with no ambience, and a bowl of dried out partially burned popcorn placed on your table. Popcorn? Um, no thank you.
*Wait staff was friendly and eager to please but obviously under educated on the fine art of restaurant service. A staff member asked if he could clear the table when we were obviously still eating. Their role is more of food runners and worker bees than proper restaurant staff. 
*Porcini Mushroom Ravioli $11 were FLAT in shape and taste; rubbery in the mouth and swimming in chicken stock. The menu claims to include truffle, but I highly doubt it.
*Signature Shrimp Tacos $17.95 were literally thrown together without talent, love or flavor!
4 soft taco shells with 2 medium sized shrimp each, a WAD of shredded carrots and no sauce. Yep. Not. Kidding. 
*Grilled Portabella Mushrooms $15.50...sigh, were to start? It was all just...Insulting!
The plate arrives with 3 obviously reheated and overly done flattened oily shrooms... the beige sauce that they call charred onion hollandaise was slopped onto the plate and had developed a hardened film on top of it from being reheated. YES. Seriously. The sweet potato and blue cheese gratin was a small box of lasagna type food...Very heavy and rich in flavor...and not in a good way.  One Brussel sprout was tasty. 

Head shaking...So. No. I do NOT recommend Nan and Byron's. Poor Quality. High Price."}
{"text":"I took my husband here for Valentine's Day brunch. He ordered the brunch buffet which included a good variety but it was somewhat thrown together. They included items like eggs, sausage, pancakes and then there were random items like chicken fried rice, hush puppies, and pimento cheese with crackers. However, the seafood was a great bonus because he loves seafood. Unfortunately,  I'm allergic to seafood (and other things) so I ordered from the menu. I have to say that I wasn't very impressed though. I ordered an omelet with white toast. When I received my omelet there was wheat toast on top. I'm allergic to whole wheat and reiterated this to the server. The waitress came out and asked if I had an allergy. I stated yes (once again) and noted that that's the reason I initially asked for white toast. My food was brought out again but there was nothing overly spectacular about it. The home fries were hard and salty, the toast extremely hard (as it was old) and the omelet bland. I'm a true foodie so I am very disappointed when my meal leaves much to be desired. When the check came I noticed that I had been charged for items I never ordered or even received. The waitress seemed dumbfounded when I advised her of the additional erroneous charges. So ultimately they couldn't bring me what I asked for and then charged me for things I didn't ask for. This experience left much to be desired."}
{"text":"We went with a family group of 8 to Sunday Brunch this past weekend. The food was amazing. When we arrived, even with our reservation, we were put on a waiting list. After waiting for 15 minutes, we inquired about the wait, and the hostess was a bit snarky. But, the manager came to the rescue and made things right immediately.
Tiny little issue aside, the food was great and the manager checked on us frequently and provided us with free desserts. The desserts were amazing. Their take on \"oreo\" cookies and milk was a breath of fresh air! Amazingly delicious. 
All of the food was fantastic. We will definitely be returning to try dinner!"}
{"text":"I love the southern style menu here. The inside is rustic, yet intimate. Their food is one of a kind, and I love that they have deviled eggs on their appetizer list. Definitely somewhere everyone needs to try. Great drink list as well!"}
{"text":"The owners of 5 Church have done it again with Nan and Byron's. We started lunch with the Pablano Cheese dip and the Poppers. Both were excellent! I ordered the meatloaf sandwich due to the stellar reviews on Yelp and I was glad that I did.  The pan seared meatloaf was full of flavor - crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.  The Mojito fries were good but not great.  I think I had built them up in my head to taste a certain way and they just didn't live up to the mint/lime flavor I was expecting.  

The ambiance inside the restaurant is pretty trendy.  Certainly a cool place to enjoy a nice meal and a few drinks with friends."}
{"text":"I did not start off on the right foot with this restaurant. Their first contact with me was a phone call threatening to cancel my reservation if I did not call back to confirm \"due to the increased business of restaurant week\". I only had a party of 4 scheduled and looked on OpenTable to find there were still plenty of spots available leading up to my 6:30 reservation. It was for a Wednesday after all. This irked me so much I almost cancelled in favor of finding another restaurant for my group. 

By the time Wednesday rolled around 2 of the group were unable to attend so I easily updated the reservation. Part of me wishes I had not done that because our reserved table for 2 people was an uncomfortable high top at the bar. However people were generally helpful in retrieving my purse whenit kept falling off the chair with the rounded back. 

We started with a complimentary bowl of popcorn which had an interesting spicy BBQ seasoning on it. I ordered the tuna tartare as my appetizer which was delicious! I loved the sauces artfully spread across my plate to compliment the tuna. My sister said the fried oysters were delicious and I take her at her word since she left none for me to try!

I opted for the $5 upcharge to get the scallops. The plate contained 4 large and correctly cooked scallops but the seasoning on them was far too strong. I would have enjoyed the dish more if it had more of a scallop taste. 

The cheesecake at the end had a very coarse crust but the filling was good. 
The meal was delicious but the atmosphere and experience were lacking. I will probably return for drinks but not for dinner."}
{"text":"I went with my family for Easter Brunch. The food was pretty good. I really enjoyed the smoked Salmon. They also had cold crabs, and fresh oysters included. The Carving stations, they had ham and turkey, which was a little cold to me, but overall everything was Great! I will be going back."}
{"text":"i didnt order the meatloaf but tried someone elses....yum!  the Sriracha ketchup makes it.  also tried someones beet burger, holy deliciousness, next time im ordering that.  i got prime rib and was disappointed by the taste, temperature, and ratio of edible meat to pure fat.  farmhouse strawberry lemonade was so yummy i could have had 10 of them. they do an impressive job with the sautéed kale and 2  for the deviled eggs, and im super picky about those.  the prices are perfect and you cant beat that rustic vibe with the roll up garage door leading to the patio seating."}
{"text":"Nan & Byron's has been on our \"must try\" list for a couple of months.   As soon as we walked in, we could tell that the restaurant has a very fun vibe to it!  The hostess was very pleasant and we were seated right away.  

Our server came over right away with a basket of fresh seasoned popcorn.  I'm a popcorn NUT so this was the perfect way to make a great first impression!  We asked for drink/beer suggestions and were pleased with the recommendations.  My husband ordered the Meatloaf with Mac & Cheese and he loved it.  I ordered the Crispy Beet sandwich and it was awesome!  (It's like a larger version of the delicious beet sliders at their sister restaurant 5Church)

Although the restaurant was pretty busy, we never felt rushed and the server did a great job of spreading the love around to all of her tables.

It was a great meal and a great dining experience and we can't wait to go back for dinner and to give their Sunday Brunch a try!"}
{"text":"Nan and Byron's is my new favorite restaurant in the Southend. Everyday I drive past it and have wanted to go in. This weekend I finally got the chance. We showed up about 45 minutes early for our reservation so we just hung out at the bar and got some drinks. When we got seated we were put in the outdoor area that had a tent over it and some heat lamps. It was very crowded in the restaurant since it was the Saturday of Valentine's Day weekend, but it was freezing in the tent. We asked if we could move tables once we sat down because we all had to sit there in our winter coats to be even remotely warm. They moved us to a table that was still in the tent but closer to a heat lamp. While it was a bit warmer i definitely would have preferred to be inside since it was only 30 degrees out. That is where my complaints stop for Nan and Byron's though. 
We started our meal with the Sushi Grade Tuna Tartare to split between the three of us and it was fantastic. I don't like Tuna Tartare when it is ground up but this was cubed tuna and was very buttery and delicious. It was a perfect palate cleanser to start the meal. I had heard wonderful things about their popcorn so we asked our waitress for some because it didn't look like they were giving it to everyone. It completely lived up to the hype. I would have never thought to put Cayenne on popcorn but now i can't see eating it without it. I ordered the Spiced Prime Bistro (medium rare), my dad got the C.A.B. Filet Mignon (medium rare), and my mom got the Pan Roasted Chicken Pot Pie. While ordering my dad also asked for a small Caesar salad but it never came. By the time we realized it never came we were already halfway through the meal and didn't think it was worth the trouble. My Spiced Prime Bistro was great. My only complaint about it was that it was a bit more medium than medium rare. The potatoes were to die for though. I could have made those my entire meal. My dad's C.A.B. Filet was also great and so was the Pan Roasted Chicken Pot Pie. The puff pastry was an awesome substitute to the normal pie crust for chicken pot pie. Like I said this is a great restaurant and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We visited on a Friday night.  It was very busy, but were seated not too long after our reservation time.  We stopped by the bar while we waited for a few cocktails.  Overall the cocktails were okay.  I had a lemonade cocktail which really just tasted like lemonade and had more ice than cocktail so it disappeared fast.  My second cocktail with rosemary was pretty decent.  Others in my party had the jalapeno cocktail, but they weren't too impressed.  Our waitress was nice enough, though definitely not warm and fuzzy.  We had the queso dip for an appetizer and we all found it to be pretty addictive...you just wanted to keep eating it.  And then our entrees came out in record speed.  Like...\"Did you already have the plates made and you stuck them in the microwave?\" fast.  I had tomato soup and grilled cheese.  I was expecting some fancy grilled cheese on some type of artisan bread with a hearty tomato soup, maybe topped with some creme fraiche or housemade croutons for pizazz.  But it was just plain old soup with average taste and regular cheese on white wonder bread.  I was not impressed.  Others in the group had meatloaf which they said was spicy and they thought it was a solid 3 stars.  I would come here if people wanted to meet here for drinks and appetizers, I guess, but I will not be returning on my own accord."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about Nan & Byron's! We enjoyed a meal together as a small group before deciding to book out the entire place for our company holiday party. 

Laura (the manager), chef, and staff, went above and beyond to make sure every detail was perfect. She worked with us to put  together a delicious menu that vegans, meat-eaters, and those with nut allergies could all enjoy. They printed out special menu's with our corporate logo, laminated a BINGO game we planned on playing, and Laura even went to our office to pick up a slide show we put together that we had trouble emailing. They were so friendly to us and very observant of our needs- you couldn't find a better group of people as far as staff is concerned. 

 We had the (awesome) opportunity to try nearly everything on the menu between the two meals. My favorites were the brussel sprouts (a seasonal limited-offering but they are perfection), the peppadew poppers served with the best ranch on the planet, and the brownies. We also sampled many-a- beverage to narrow  down our cocktail selection. My two favorites were the Farmhouse Lemonade and the Night Shade Martini- fresh and very tasty! 

The place is relaxed and casual enough for a night out with friends, but also softly lit and would make a nice place to take a date. I highly recommend it for groups as well.We had about 50 people and they were able to take care of us perfectly. 

I will definitely return again soon!"}
{"text":"Welcome to SouthEnd!

This new restaurant in SouthEnd is going to an immediate hot-spot.  The atmosphere, the food, the service - it's absolutely fantastic and a testament to the people who came together to open this place!

We tried four different cocktails, some Cabernet, a couple burgers/fries + wings.  All were wonderful.  The wings had good spice but were not too hot!  The burgers were custom and cooked to order!  We shared an amazingly rich and chocolatey warm brownie with a salted caramel sauce.  

The cocktail list is innovative!  It's a great menu with plenty of options.  You are sure to find the drink for you in this mix! 

Jump on OpenTable now and enjoy this new joint.  Cheers."}
{"text":"Everything about my experience at Nan and Byron's was perfect! I recently moved to Charlotte, and it was at the top of my list of places to try. I took my mom for restaurant week last weekend and was extremely happy with my choice. Every detail of the decor was so well done and I loved that they had the heaters outside. We were a little worried about having to sit so close to the table beside us but we couldn't even hear their conversation. 

We started with the jalapeno margaritas and they were awesome! Fresh jalapenos and whipped egg whites on top. None of that fake lime sweetness that you get with some margaritas. Worth the $12. Instead of bread they bring out this delicious spicy popcorn that they put their wing dust on. I would take that over bread any day. It went perfect with the margs too. 

I started with the wings with the ghost pepper honey mustard and OMG they were the best wings I have ever had. Perfectly crispy and the sauce was great. I cannot wait to go back and have those again, probably on a Tuesday when they have half-priced wine! I typically don't like oysters, but anything fried is a different ballgame. I had a couple of my moms fried oysters that were served on a pineapple plank and topped with a fresh jalapeno and loved them! 

I had the salmon entree and it was very good, but I thought it needed a sauce. It was just missing a little something. I asked our server for some of the sauce that came with the wings. He was like ranch? That's embarrassing. It was such good homemade ranch that I couldn't even tell thats what it was though. All of the dill in it ended up being the perfect compliment for the salmon. So um, I suggest ordering ranch with your salmon...when in the South right? 

My mom got the hangar steak with the sweet potato blue cheese gratin and it was amazing! I am not a blue cheese fan but it was still delicious. 

We got the key lime tart and s'mores cheesecake for dessert with coffee and Baileys. Both were good but I wouldn't have ordered dessert if it didn't come with the restaurant week menu. 

If you can't tell by now, we loved the food. The service was just as good! Our server Bryan went above and beyond. We let him know we were in no rush and wanted to hang out and he took his time and never made us feel rushed even though I am sure they had reservations coming in after us. He was attentive, friendly and made excellent recommendations. It never felt like he was interrupting the meal! He did an excellent job. 

I can't wait to go back as I pretty much want to try everything on the menu and I definitely want to try their brunch."}
{"text":"The atmosphere of the place? Excellent. Of course, I might just be remembering Vinnie's, and they've done a great job reimagining the place. It looks great. Staff up front is fiendishly friendly as well.

On the downside, the bar can get incredibly loud if you're there at the wrong time, which is to say if they are busy and you really don't want to be in a bar, but would rather just sit and have a nice dinner. The problem with this is that there are a few tables in the bar section, which is where they may seat you. Fine if you want to sit in a bar, but not so much if you want dinner.

I will certainly second the popcorn that is brought out with a nice kick to it - very cool, and something you don't often see (I'm sure it's cheaper than bread too, but that doesn't really matter). The only problem is that there isn't a great way to get it out of the basket and onto the plates they give you - not a good choice if you're at a large table of people who don't really know each other. Having bowls or spoons or something would help here, and speaking of large table, we went through that popcorn in no time flat, and it was never refilled. Even chips at a lower-end Mexican place get refilled, so not sure if it usually is or if we hit them on a bad night, but we didn't see any more popcorn.

The menu was actually really interesting, but poblano cheese served with house-made chips had great flavor, coupled with a strange consistency to the cheese made things seem really off. On the plus side, we ran out of chips on this dish, and those were replenished quickly. Guess they had more chips, but not more popcorn. The poppers were odd - you take a bite, and half of the breading falls onto the plate, while a large chunk of pepper remains in your mouth, and most of the cheese drips onto the plate in the form of grease. Not the best presentation I've seen, though the sauce was good.

Oddly enough, the drinks were also refilled quickly - water, sodas, even beer. Maybe it was just the popcorn, but even dishes from the kitchen came out rather slowly, giving an overall impression of slowness to the whole night.

When the main courses finally came out, it was a haphazard arrangement. The pork was a chunk of meat - and I don't mind a bunch of pork now - but little else, served in a bowl. Why serve a big chunk of meat in a bowl, with no bread or anything? Sure, you get a side, and that's okay, but a plate would be a much better choice. Corn (off the cob) is also served in a bowl, with no spoons, so getting it out with a fork is a challenge, and though there is spice available with sides, such as sriracha by itself or with ranch, it's charged per serving (and they don't mention this up-front, which is annoying). Flavors are good, but a bit on the bland side. Even \"crispy\" fries really aren't.

It may have been an off night, but I'm not sure I'll give them a try again soon."}
{"text":"We had gone to try out Nan and Byron's for the first time. Instantly liked the atmosphere and vibe. 

We had reservations and immediately sat down. The waitress was helpful with the food choices and served us our wine and subsequent dinner fairly quickly. The food was fantastic and instantly discussed how we wanted to come back and try again. 

Every table was full that night, and I could see when I walked to the restroom, so was the bar.  There were a few people waiting to be seated, but nothing crazy. Just a busy night at a restaurant. 

We had been at our table for 45-50 minutes as we were finishing our wine. A male hostess, for lack of knowing his real role, came an asked us if he could have our table to seat others. He said he would buy us drinks at the bar, but didn't offer us a seat at it for there were none. 

We had just paid the bill 5 minutes prior. We agreed to leave the table and stand to finish our wines. Both of us surprised that we just got kicked out of our table after spending a lot on dinner. 

When the same male hostess came back around, I stopped him to say, \"I've been to a lot of restaurants, and never have I ever been kicked out of the table after spending almost $100 on a meal\".   His response was that he was sorry, it was a busy night and he was only doing what he was told by the owner. My reply in turn was, \"busy is what happens, if he wants people to return again and continue to be busy, you don't kick us out.  Please share that with him\". 

I would have given this restaurant a 4 star, however, after being removed from our table in less than an hour, I'm giving it a 2."}
{"text":"First time an it was amazing I started with the caprese salad than grilled salmon with kale an potatoes . The salmon was perfectly flakey delish not to mention the beet vinergrette wow an I don't like beets lol my friend ordered the beet burger I did have a bite an I was very impressed. Great taste they lightly fry it or bake but on a bun w avacado n cheese I'll try that next time. I finished that meal off with their turtle cheesecake wonderful it was NY style mmm it was smack your mama delish.Lookin forward to next time an I saw a lot of people ordering the app hush puppies mm"}
{"text":"I drive by this place everyday and have wanted to try it for a while now. So when my dad came down it was the perfect time to try something new! We arrived and had no trouble being seated outside. Our server was very friendly and so personable but not extreme menu knowledgable. But alas a sweet face and being friendly will get you farther. The beer menu was great since I had just been talking up all of our local beers to my dad. They had all local crafts on tap and my dad went with the Jam Session out of the noda brewery. I had the farmhouse lemonade which was delicious. So light and had fresh strawberries and lemons. The cayenne laced popcorn was wonderful. And being a bit more health conscious, I much more preferred that to bread or chips. For dinner I had the meatloaf (because anything with siracha is delicious) and my dad had the pork with baked beans. My two sides I chose were peas and carrots and mashed potatoes. My issue with the menu is it seems to be going for a farm to table concept? But no organic meats and very few veggies to chose from. (The only vegetable side was peas and carrots). 

My dinner was decent. Nothing overly special about it but I ate it all. My dads pork was wonderful. Very tender and didn't need a knife at all. The beans were a bit sweet but not with sugar? Maybe a spice of some sort. Very different. Overall the food was pretty good but the atmosphere here was awesome. Service was a tad on the slower side. I will be back but I want to try the Sunday brunch (which seem to be where all the 5 star reviews come from)."}
{"text":"My BFF turned 30 this past Sunday. Her only request was recognizable food & an excellent cocktail list. Nan & Byron's in South End came highly recommended by friends & local media, and they did not disappoint.

We started with the Train Wreck Fries. These were amazing. The delicious fries were covered in chili, poblano cheese, sriracha ranch, scallions. We completely killed this platter of fries. We didn't finish them, but we made a pretty significant dent in them.

Before our dinners came out, we also enjoyed our cocktails. I had the 'Farmhouse Lemonade' which was Bacardi Limon, Strawberry Vodka, Limoncello, citrus juices, muddled fresh strawberries and lemon. Our table wasn't quite outside, but we were close enough that it was pretty hot. This is was super delicious and so refreshing.

Brittany had the 'Nightshade Martini', which was Pearl Pomegranate Vodka, POM Pomegranate Juice, muddled mint and fresh cucumber. I didn't have any of hers, but she loved it. Her only change would have been that the cucumbers should have been soaked in the cocktail.

We both LOVED our dinners. I typically go for seafood, but everyone raved about their red meat entrees. They were in the process of changing their menu, so the prime rib I had planned to get wasn't an option. So, I went for the Delmonico. It was 10 oz. spice rubbed and served with crushed Yukon potatoes, crispy onions, and a red wine sauce. This was absolutely delicious. The meat was tender and full of flavor, and the potatoes had a really cool texture. Different from mashed potatoes and smashed potatoes, and very tasty. The cloves of garlic that came with it were also a perfect little flavor surprise.

Britt had the meatloaf. It came with sriracha ketchup, but she wasn't sure if she'd like it, so she asked for it on the side. I didn't try any of this, but she loved it. I couldn't get over the size of the portion. It was a HUGE serving of meatloaf, veggies and potatoes.

Unfortunately we both finished our meals, so neither of us had any desire for dessert. Well, there was a desire, but there was no room. At all. But our meal was worth it. Everything was delicious and our server was wonderful! I'll definitely be back on a future Charlotte visit. so"}
{"text":"Business lunch today here and it was fabulous. Sweet potato waffle fries with the Farmboy burger and it's hard to be disappointed. Juicy, cheesy, bacony. All the goodness. Great variety of sandwich selections. Really want to make it back for dinner before too long."}
{"text":"3pm on a Saturday. Starving in South End after a painting class at the new Pinot's Palette. We tried to go to Tupelo Honey but the parking lot was chaos. So, we decided to hit N&B's instead.

This was my first time checking out the brunch menu... and it will not be my last. My friend Dre and I are not very good at making decisions, so we put our menu decisions in the hands of our server. By the way, she was just fantastic. She suggested we do Shrimp & \"Grits\" and the Beets Benedict. 

OH.MY.WORD. The Beets Benedict... I would like to write a love song for that dish. Absolutely amazing. The crispy beets, poached egg, creamed kale and red pepper relish... wow, tremendous combination. The Shrimp and \"Grits\" is actually done with creamy polenta. So good. We ate every single morsel of food.

I went with my go to cocktail here.. the Nightshade Martini. Our server suggested the Saint's Cut for Dre. Great cocktail. Bulleit Bourbon, St. Germaine, Prosecco, citrus juices. Not super bourbon-y. 

Great staff, amazing food. This place just keeps getting better. (Spoiler alert: be on the lookout for brunch to transform to a buffet style this weekend)"}
{"text":"We went to Nan And Bryon's this past Sunday for brunch. Still adjusting from my move to Charlotte from Florida, I was disappointed to be reminded that mimosas and bloody mary's won't be served until 12; we were there at 11. The buffet purchase includes a mimosa, bloody mary, or other drink. Regardless, we both elected to do the brunch buffet as the menu looked solid. Once at the buffet line, I grabbed a little bit of everything: smoked salmon, scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage gravy with a biscuit, a deviled egg, a small veggie frittata, cavatappi (seafood) pasta salad, a fresh oyster, and bacon mac and cheese. Everything was good, but nothing jumped out as a spectacular item. I was full from my plate but would have gone back for more bacon mac and cheese if I had room. I wouldn't have valued the meal at $21, especially since the alcoholic drink wasn't included in our visit."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, this place is currently in my top 3 for favorite Uptown/Southend lunch spots, however, they are 1 more bad experience from being at the bottom of the list. I love the popcorn they bring you (they dont have it on the weekeds though, bummer). I always get the same thing, turkey club with mojito fries. I am obssessed with the mojito fries, however, last time I went with 14 friends and made everyone try them and no one was quite as excited as I was about them. I still stand by them being amazing!!! 

The location is pretty convenient on South Blvd, parking is tight, but if you arent taking all day there is a RiteAid parking lot next door. 

I have been here a dozen times, everytime my experience is the same... food is great, server is always nice but slooooow and always forgets things. I am always surprised at how empty this place is over lunch, but I believe it is because no one can go there on a 1 hour lunch break. Even with it 1/2 empty, they still cant get you in and out in around an hour. I am getting a turkey club and fries!? Still takes sooo long!! Last time my club was missing bacon and they never brought my sauce I requested. 

A few weeks ago I had a 1 oclock reservation for me and 14 friends. We finally sat down at about 1:50, luckily we all stood around the bar and had drinks or we would have been gone! We were all starving, luckily we got appetizers because it took them until 2:30 to get anyones orders. Our food came out a little after 3... 3 people had messed up orders, everyone was missing something, drinks were rarely filled, and the waitress had no personality and no urgency. 

It saddens me to report that the service is so slow and terrible, I have friends who wont even go there with me.... this place has such a cool atmosphere, location and tons of pottential... they need to get it together before they sink!"}
{"text":"This was only my second time to Nan and Byron's and I feel compelled to say the first time was a great dinner experience! 

This time, however, I went for brunch and will not be returning. I took a group of 8 people as I had 7 girlfriends visiting from out of state. I researched the brunch menu before we went because I wanted to be sure to choose a crowd pleaser. 

The website said that we could order from the breakfast menu or choose the buffet. When we got to the restaurant the waiter told us that not all of the breakfast menu options were available and my friend (the only one who didn't get the buffet) could only choose between three things. 

Waiter didn't know if the bar could make a Bellini and took longer than normal to return with the answer.

After a very long wait and many of the buffet-eaters being through with their meals, our waiter came by and spoke to my menu-ordering friend and said her food was almost ready. 

After an even longer (and noticeably inconvenient) wait, the waiter then came back and told my menu-ordering friend that he was mistaken and she couldn't order off the menu. Instead, she would have no choice but to get the buffet!! After that long of a wait and now being forced to order off the more-expensive buffet and he didn't even offer her a discount or a free beverage. Not only were the rest of us done eating by this time - he had previously told her that he checked on her food and it would be ready. Unacceptable service!

Then he came by to pick up our credit cards at the end. If you've ever been to this restaurant, you know they put your credit cards on adorable, individual clipboards. After taking a very, very long time to process our payments (8 separate people, I understand) he returned to say, \"We don't take Discover.\" Could he not have noticed the Discover cards when he picked them all up individually?

To top it all off, as we were leaving we heard a different waiter tell another table about a mimosa special. Seven out of the 8 of us had just ordered mimosas with our meals and paid a higher price. 

Nobody in my group complained once! We didn't complain about all of the long waits, about the menu not matching what was online, or my friend being lied to about our waiter checking on her food. 

While the food was delicious, having waiters who are not knowledgeable about the menu, the bar, OR the payment systems is unacceptable and ruined our dining experience.

I wish Nan and Byron's much success (and a better staff training program!)"}
{"text":"Soooo good! Have been here twice and both times it was amazing. The chicken is sooo good but excited to try other things as well.... And all the sides are delicious. Their drinks off of the drink menu are TOO good!!!! Definitely give them a try. Also, they service we received was both times was excellent! Can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food, drink and service. I highly recommend it. Nan's was able to quickly accommodate a large party for us even though we had no reservations and it was packed. Def try the new filet and chicken dish they just added to the menu!"}
{"text":"Nan and B! 3.5 stars.

Our party of 6 had reservations at 8:00.  We had to wait about 20 minutes for our table, which was slightly annoying but mitigated by a delicious cocktail, the Saint's Cut. Bourbon, St. Germaine, prosecco and citrus juices.  Never in a million years would I have thought to combine bourbon with St. Germaine. It was amazing!  I downed that one pretty fast and then ordered the Refashioned.  I am a girl who LOVES an Old Fashioned.  This cocktail packs a serious punch.  Bourbon, orange and peach bitters and muddled strawberries, oranges and cherries. Don't let all that sweetness cover up how strong this drink really is!

Appetizers: I am not usually a cheese dip lover, but the poblano cheese dip is out of this world. Smoky and cheesy...not your average queso!  Wonderful with the chips.

Those peppadew poppers were also fantastic. The deviled eggs were fine but nothing out of the ordinary.

Entrees: My husband ordered the Meatloaf, which I wish I had gotten.  The sriracha ketchup on top was too spicy for him but just right for me.  He asked for it on the side, but his wish was not granted. 

I ordered the crispy beet burger and found it to be quite bland. However, I LOVED the Brussels sprouts that I chose as my side.  I am trying to figure out what sauce they are cooked in. Hoisin maybe? Sweet and tangy. So yum.

Dessert: No question--get the cheesecake. It's of the light and fluffy variety and served with the most delicious caramel drizzle. 

My only real complaint is that we felt rushed the entire meal.  It was very obvious that they were trying to turn our table as quickly as possible.  I prefer to savor my food and enjoy the meal as a dining experience, rather than wolf down my food and get out. Just me? I think not."}
{"text":"The saltiest bite of food I've ever had...yuck!!!

I won't be going back.  Taste your food, chef...c'mon!"}
{"text":"While Nan and Byron's is a good lunch place, they provide a pretty poor dinner experience. 

We were denied seating in the main dining room (which we found out was due to an inexperienced hostess), ending up in the bar with club music blasting - and this was on a Sunday night. The food was also very sub-par - their signature popcorn was barely seasoned, the cheese dip appetizer was literally in the shape of an ice cream scoop (felt like we were in a cafeteria), and some signature potato dish was just a compressed square of potato and cheese, which was obviously from some massive pan, no attempt to make it appear nice at all. 

Keep in mind, this is not a cheap place. I'd stay away from this place for dinner."}
{"text":"Came here for restaurant week.  They give you popcorn beforehand which is a yummy little snack as opposed to bread.  I had the meatballs and they were delicious!

Heard its a great place for lunch as well, although I've never been."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this spot more.  I figured it would be good based in yelp reviews.  Went for Sunday brunch last week.  Blahhh. The best thing on the buffet was the chicken and mini brownies. Eggs were those cheap carton ones and spongy.  Also for the price there wasn't an extensive selection.   I was most disappointed by the oysters.  They were very fishy and on top of that lukewarm.  I mentioned to the hostess that they might want to put more ice in to keep the oysters cool. She seemed very concerned but when the manager came out all he did was push around the already warm fishy oysters."}
{"text":"Two stars this visit- both for the craft cocktail. Deviled eggs were dry and flavorless. Tuna tartare - devoid of anything that would make it unique. 
I guess the owners reap accolades for new restaurants, and hope the old tired ones can continue to ride on the coattails.
Ugh. Done with this place."}
{"text":"We dined here on Thursday but I've been putting off writing this review because I could not decide how I wanted to rate this place.. but I finally came to a decision- 3.5 stars. The food was tasty, for the most part, & our server was friendly, but there was some confusion about what sides we ordered and some of the food we received wasn't even warm by the time it got to our table. Fortunately, management stepped up & took care of things.. well, mostly.

As soon as we were seated, we were given a bowl of the addictive, seasoned popcorn. I'm a mindless snacker & we ended up going through 2 bowls throughout our meal.. plus we took a fresh batch home :) I ordered Dancing Cranberries, which consisted of prosecco, white cranberry juice, and dried cranberries. It was very good & what an apropos name for this drink! The little cranberries were bouncing around due to the carbonation of the prosecco.. pretty amusing.. or maybe I'm just easily amused?

We got the peppadew popper app & it was quite good as well, though nothing amazing. I think I would have preferred a different type of pepper, with a little more spice & less sweetness, but that's just me. I mean, it was still tasty.. you really can't go wrong with fried, cheese-stuffed peppers!

For my entree, I went with the mushroom & for my 2 sides I went potato on potato & got the mojito fries & mashed potatoes. BF ordered the meatloaf with slaw & corn as his sides. Our entrees arrived in a timely manner, but this is also where the confusion started. My mushroom had its quinoa stuffing but there was also some corn under it & I got my mojito fries. BF got his meatloaf, also with corn under it.. & sweet potato fries? We were each given a side we didn't order but our server said we could still keep them & brought out our other sides shortly after. Problem #1 solved.. or so I thought.

The second problem was that our food wasn't even warm. In fact, my mashed potatoes were straight up COLD. Not acceptable. My mushroom was room temperature & BF's meatloaf was barely warm, but he was still ok with it. I let our server know that my entree wasn't even warm, let alone hot, & told her it wasn't that big of a deal & if she could just stick it in the microwave to heat it up, I'd be fine, but she was extremely gracious about it & said they could cook a brand new one for me. I appreciated that but I don't like sending food back because it makes me feel high maintenance. I let her take the mushroom & kept quiet about my mashed potatoes & just took them home (they turned out to be very good after I heated them up).

My food was actually better than I expected, when it finally arrived, hot. I did notice that mushroom #2 was significantly smaller than mushroom #1 but whatever, at least I finally had an edible entree. The only thing I didn't really enjoy was the quinoa stuffing, but the portobello itself was deliciously marinated & nicely grilled. The mojito fries were also tasty. Normally, I'm pretty apprehensive about mint being in savory foods (the same way I feel about fruit inside salads.. *shudder*) but the flavors worked very well & I loved the little bit of tartness. I think BF liked the meatloaf & he said the sriracha ketchup was subtly spicy (which to him is a good thing).

After we were done eating, our bill arrived & our server let us know they comped the mushroom for all of the trouble, which was pleasantly unexpected. However, we also noticed that we were charged for the slaw, when we shouldn't have been. I know, it's only $4, but the slaw was supposed to come with my BF's meal.. whatever. I just let it go because they DID take the mushroom off the bill & I felt like I was being super high maintenance all night. Still, it was a bit of a wtf moment.

Despite all of the trouble, I can definitely see the potential in this place. They really do care about their customer's experience. We will be back & hopefully I will think this place is more than A-OK :)"}
{"text":"This is just a quick review since I stopped by for a beer or two before visiting the art thing a couple yards away. 

Beer is what it is - no complaints there.  If I complain about the beer, then that's pretty poor of them.  Service was exceptional.  Bartenders were attentive and they had infinite staff just standing around ... which is exactly what you want when you're a new restaurant/bar.  You've invested in making this restaurant fully operational and want to draw in diners.  Liven the place up, and make it feel like it's poppin' (Cf. La Tagliatelle). 

The receipts come with a donation line allowing patrons to donate to the Levine Children's Hospital or something, so please donate!  

Looking forward to coming back here to try the food.  The reviews have got me hungry.

dmo out"}
{"text":"Definitely a unique spot! 

Atmosphere:
I think the front door describes the atmosphere perfectly. The doorhandles are a pitchfork and shovel on large modern glass doors.

The staff:
I've gone twice and had two different experiences. 
The first time we randomly stopped in and we came in pretty casual clothes (We came in our clean workout clothes). They seemed to do a minimal job and tried to get me out the door and borderline rude. 
The second time, we were better dressed and the staff was more friendly. However, I still felt they were not very attentive and did an OK job.

The Food:
To start, they bring out spicy popcorn. 
I had the meatloaf and the wifey had the tacos. I think the meatloaf is the best in Charlotte so far. For comparison, the meatloaf at King's kitchen is excellent but comes in second place to this. The wifey really enjoyed the tacos."}
{"text":"Brunch is Awesome. You can choose from salads to meatloaf and shrimp with grits to crab legs and french toast. It was wonderful. Panthers game was on too and it was nice with the garage door open. My 3rd visit and I am always suprised."}
{"text":"I just saw that it has closed, I could have told everyone one that, the food was a absolutely horrible and the staff had such a bad attitude every time I went, I had been there three times and could not figure out why I was waisting my money and time, but you have to suck it up sometimes to be with friends, another creations of 5Church, someone must have a good publicist for  5 Church and is sister restaurant's, I don't see the fuss"}
{"text":"Happy Thanksgiving. I have a lot to be thankful for. This place and the experience I had was definitely not one of them. To save you some time, my honest opinion is that I woulde NOT pick Nan & Byron's for anything again.

My wife and I decided to see my family in Dallas during Christmas break so we stayed in Charlotte and I chose Nan & Byron's for lunch after the Novant Health Thanksgiving parade because Capital Grille was all booked and I go to 5Church too often. The fact that the same management runs 5Church made me feel confident about my decision.

They weren't ready when we walked in. We walk in, tell the guy who greeted us that we had a reservation and he goes, \"you don't have a reservation?\" in the way that sounded like 'why are you here so early.' I did have a reservation by the way. He just didn't hear me right the first time.

He shows us the table and while we walk towards it, there's the entire restaurant employees sitting in a circle chatting although their business hours clearly started. By this time, I'm pretty much thinking this is going to be a disaster so let's try my best to have fun.

So, we wait for the apps, and we got happy because the biscuits and the salads were good. The turkey and the pork were not good, on the other hand. I tried to be a good sport though. And that was my Thanksgiving lunch at Nan & Byron's, where I didn't find a reason to go back to."}
{"text":"I wish there was a way I could rate the food and then serivce seperate.  I guess if I average the two it would be 3.5

I loved the hostesses...they were super accomodating to my large party of 12 for a Monday night.  Celebrating a birthday, I brought a cake with me and without me having to ask, they asked if I wanted it back in their cooler until we were ready.  Wow...yes..thank you.  I didn't even have to ask and I just felt like they really appreciated us being there.  Our wait staff was really friendly and nice, slow, but nice.  They brought drink orders out in a decent amount of time, however they forgot my first drink twice and took a moment for them to brink me a second round.  But I still thought the over all services were good.  They even brought out the cake in the end, and cut it for me.  Nice. 

Food - Less than par.  Sorry.  My arugula salad with chilled shrimp didn't have any taste to it.  I figured the shrimp would have been grilled...not like a shrimp cocktail on top of lettuce.  Boring.  Hubs ordered the meatloaf and it tasted as if it were frozen, they thawed it out, and put it in the microwave and then covered it with ketchup. He wasn't impressed, and neither was I.  I had a bite of the mushroom dish and that was ok.  Lacked flavor.  

Bottom line, the atmosphere is great, outdoor patio area is really great but the food I was not really impressed with.  I would come here however for drinks and that's probably about it.  It was pretty pricey too.  For chilled shrimp and some lettuce, it was $7.25.  Smh...."}
{"text":"Four of us thought we would try this place out. Overall, it was a good experience and somewhere I would go again; however, I may order a different entree. 

The popcorn is good as are the deviled eggs that we ordered as an appetizer. The Noda Pale Ale is tasty, too! 

As for my entrée, I ordered the meatloaf with corn and mac and cheese. The meatloaf was a little pink in the middle (something I do NOT like!), but the mac & cheese and corn were great. 

Next time, I'm thinking of trying the Spaghetti and Meatballs. 

Cute interior, BTW! :)"}
{"text":"Always a good date night dinner spot. From their old bay type seasoned popcorn to their decadent desserts, there's something for everyone on the menu. 

My fiancé always gets their salmon and claims it as his favorite in Charlotte. I tend to wander on the menu, from the crispy beet burger to the bucatini pasta, everything is always prepared beautifully and tastes great. 

My only one disappointment...their mushroom soup. I just wanted it to be thicker, or have more flavor...something in it was just missing."}
{"text":"What happened to Nan and Byron's??  The first few times I visited, shortly after they opened, the food was good and the atmosphere was fun.  However, of late every time I have been I have been so disappointed.  I had tomato soup that tasted like marinara sauce and grilled cheese that was nothing special.  The cocktails are nice but the place is so empty it's not a great scene.  They have such a great location and great decor, I hope they can turn it around!"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere of Nan and Byrons. I think our group came up with the description of rustic eclectic for it haha! So thankful they had valet because the parking there was so scarce. We were promptly greeted and seated when we came in (we had reservations FYI). I enjoyed having the complimentary popcorn seasoned with what I believe was Old Bay. Very different but appetizing! I had the deviled eggs for a starter and wasn't blown away. The catch of the day was my entree and I loved it. Seasoned perfectly and it wasn't too little or too much food. The wait for our food wasn't long at all which is a plus. For dessert we split the banana pudding which was delicious. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars was because the music was so painstakingly loud. Our reservations were for 8 pm. Which is a little late but we felt like we were screaming at each other at the table to be able to talk over the music. The waiter did say that it kind of turns into a little \"club\" atmosphere around a certain time so I understood but it just seemed a little too early to turn up the music that loud. Friendly staff and good food. I would go back but maybe a little earlier on a weekend."}
{"text":"Just ok.  The winner on the brunch buffet was the cocktail shrimp.  The loser of the whole experience was the waitress, no personality and terrible service!  Coffee was ok, my husband likes it but I've had better.  Most of the hot items were cold on the buffet...the food could have been warmer or fresh off the griddle/oven.  And you have to toast your own croissants/bagels/breads.  They had crab legs on the menu but they were cold and hard to eat when you sit a few inches away from your neighbor.  It s a one and done kind of place, tried it but did not love enough to come back."}
{"text":"Food was great and service at the bar was fantastic until the business picked up. Then it felt like they'd 'gotten our money' (and we spent a lot) and our entree took a very long time to come out as did any follow up drink service. Felt like we'd been forgotten once it got busy. Decent food but too many other good options around town."}
{"text":"My favorite place. Meat and cheese plate and the portobello mushroom are amazing. Such a cute environment!"}
{"text":"Don't get the buffet brunch. Definitely not worth 23 bucks. I found the food to be sub-par, you get one drink, and not a big selection. We should've ordered  off the regular menu . The food looked fresher, obviously. But then again, I'm a picky bitch. You all might love it. Ok, the \"sausage gravy\" tasted odd with NO sign of sausage anywhere. Scrambled eggs looked dry, \"homefries potatoes\" were bland and tasteless and weren't homefries, they were roasted potatoes,
That's all. The shrimp was pretty good and the sauces were tasty. I didn't try the crab legs. The sticky buns were broken up and  liquidied in a sugary, Carmelized sauce and they were FUCKIN SCRUMPTIOUS !! Best thing, I thought. They had cheese and fruit, blah blah. I don't eat that shit for breakfast. I need bacon and eggs, and all that.  For me, because I prefer typical breakfast food, it wasn't worth the price and the quality suffers. I wouldn't go back. My fat ass is till trying to get into the Tupelo Honey Cafe!!'"}
{"text":"I just tried some new additions to the menu that I had to write a review on. Nan and Byron's have added two new steak dishes and a seasonal fish. I've tried the Delmonico which is their 10oz rib eye. I got it med rare and it was great! I also tried my date's catch of the day which is a fish wrapped in banana leaves. The fish was steamed and very mild. I loved the sauce. I thought that was cool and it put a little Asian twist to the dish. You want to try a good cocktail? Try the Refashioned especially if you like bourbon. I'll be back real soon."}
{"text":"Two simple dishes, fish and chips and a small cheeseburger for a child turned out terrible. We didn't finish the meal. I tasted my daughters burger and it was some small frozen patty with lots of gristle. My cod fish had a hude section of brown and chewy fish. Ugh. So easy of a dish but they must be buying cheap food and crappy cooks."}
{"text":"What a disappointment and poor experience. I almost gave them 1 star. Our waiter was bumbling over his words and couldn't answer any of our questions. 

My friends asked if there were any non dairy creamer options. He had to go find out, and then advised us they did not. How do you not have a single non diary option in the whole place?! I asked what drinks were available prior to this and I was advised coffee and juice, so I ordered plain coffee even though I wanted a latte. Once my friends asked for the creamer options he mentioned the coffee bar options. Ugh! I then traded my plain coffee for a sad, cold latte. 

We also had a wobbly table which quickly became an issue once food was served. We waited as he placed napkins etc under the table. 

We had the shrimp and polenta, which was too salty. We also had the beet Benedict and it was so bland. Not to mention our poached eggs came out hard boiled. We had to send it back to the kitchen for another and we were still disappointed. 

We will NOT be back. Sadly, I took out of town friends here. This makes me question trying 5 church."}
{"text":"Decent, but nothing great.  Cool atmosphere.  May be better for appetizers and drinks.  Because if you're doing to serve simple comfort food at those prices, it had better wow.  It does not.  Not bad, just nothing special.

I had meatloaf, mac and cheese, and sweet potato fries.  Meatloaf - nothing to write home about; in fact, we make better at home.  Mac and cheese - this had to come from a Kraft box; absolutely bland.  Sweet potato fries - very good.  

Parking is tight - be prepared.  I may go again, but it's not a \"destination\" meal."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place, which is why even after my first mediocre experience here, I was back to give it another shot recently.
I'll admit they absolutely deserve 5 stars for their service, ambiance and vibe. But, I'm there for the food, and in that department I've been disappointed twice. All their appetizers are good, the main courses however (at least the ones I have tried; 5 out of 9 of them) are below average. 
The first time our table had a few different items: The steak - which was terribly under-cooked, and looked so unappetizing that my friend who ordered it hasn't eaten steak since that day, two months ago! Of course, the manager apologized and took it off our bill, which was the right thing to do & that is why I would give their service a full 5 stars. Other items on our table included the Chicken entree and the shrimp pasta. The chicken I remember as being decent, while the shrimp was not memorable. 
On our second visit there we had a good experience with the cocktails and appetizers, but again were disappointed by the main course. This time I had the grilled mushroom, while my husband tried the pie. The dishes weren't bad, but there was nothing amazing about them either. The price neither justified the portion nor the flavor. I'd go back there, but only to enjoy their bar, ambiance and the appetizers!"}
{"text":"Wow.  Just...wow.  You need to definitely come here and check this place out!

The parking is small, but finding a place to park and then walking your patootie into this restaurant is SO worth it.  As soon as you walk in you will see the hostess stand right smack in front of you.  They have a coat rack for you to hang your coat on the right and plenty of space for you to wait for your party to the left.  It is comfy seating with cushions on the bench for you.

Now, the food.  Oh my goodness, YUM.  So with this restaurant, instead of receiving the traditional bread, you get popcorn.  I repeat, POPCORN.  Did I ask for a second basket of popcorn while I was here, yes I absolutely did!  It's so delicious!  Seriously, I want to have that popcorn every day because it's the bomb diggity.  If you don't know what appetizer to try, get the Deviled Eggs.  You won't be sorry.  As for the meal, I had ordered the Braised Lamb Shank.  It was so good I felt like I was in a dream world.  

The service here was absolutely wonderful.  Our server was very nice, and also patient as I kept asking questions about the menu to pick what I absolutely wanted.  Such good Southern charm all over here.

Please check this place out as they are definitely worth a try.  I plan on coming back real soon!"}
{"text":"I ate here for Queen's Feast/ Charlotte's Restaurant Week on Sunday, 1/31/2016 at 6:30 PM with 2 friends. I would ideally like to give Nan and Byron's 3.5 stars, but can't do half.. so I decided to go up rather than down.

Our original reservation was for 6, but we were running late and they accommodated us by moving us to 6:30. The staff is super friendly. Nan and Byron's is very appealing to the eye. It has a funky and creative entrance that is glass and the door handles are a shovel and a 4-pronged rake. The glass immediately draws you in so you can admire the very neatly designed copper ceiling. There's a coat rack to the right, restrooms to the left and you're directly greeted by a check-in desk upon arrival. Past check in is the brightly lit and fully stocked bar with many stools to the left and 2 rows of high tables paired with chairs. The bar serves a good variety of local beers and wines. There are also TVs to watch sports or entertainment. To the rear of the main dining room, is a one-step up elevated booth area with 4 tables. Off of the main dining room to the right is another fairly large dining area with regular height tables and chairs. It is dimly lit. There is also an outdoor area that is open in nice weather and wrapped in plastic in the winter. The kitchen is off to the left of the main dining area.  

As a complimentary starter each table is presented with flavored popcorn. It is very airy and has a slight kick after taste. Two of us weren't big fans of it, while the other person loved it. 

An alcoholic beverage was included in the Queen's Feast menu at this establishment. I choose Riesling, while my counterparts chose Absolut vodka with cranberry juice. One person tried a sample of a local beer called Copper. We had waters all around. 

My personal choice of appetizer was the Cobb salad. I loved the lettuce. I believe it was green leaf lettuce and 4-6 full pieces were on my plate surrounded by sides of crumbled egg, blue cheese, avocado and halved cherry or grape tomatoes. I omitted the bacon, since i'm a vegetarian. The lettuce and tomatoes made the cobb salad very crispy and fresh, but overall it was more creamy due to the avocado, cheese and egg. It was supposed to come with blue cheese dressing, but didn't have any (or much), which worked out well. It was tasty and I enjoyed it. One friend also had the salad, but without the blue cheese and opted for another type of dressing. The other had sweet chili chicken wings. The first order came out cold and then when a steaming replacement plate came out, she decided she didn't like them and the other person who got the salad ended up eating a majority of them. 

My entree selection was Grilled Portobello Mushrooms drizzled with charred onion hollandaise with sweet potato blue cheese gratin and Brussels sprouts. The portobellos had a definite grilled flavor and my two meat eating friends both agreed it was delicious. One even said it tasted like steak! Nice portion size, about 4 medium sized portobellos! The sweet potato blue cheese gratin looks like a thick piece of ham and I questioned our waiter, who said \"no, that's not meat.\" Haha. It was surprisingly very creamy and tasty, even though i'm not a big blue cheese person.. it was very interesting, creative, thinking outside of the box dish! I'm also not a huge fan of Brussels sprouts, but these were excellent.. practically my favorite part of the meal! They were halved, naturally buttery, crispy on the outside and seasoned well. I believe they were either just grilled or steamed and grilled. They were so good.. stole the show! I packed part of my entree to go and enjoyed it for dinner tonight at work. The sweet potato blue cheese gratin wasn't as good as when it was first prepared, but still edible. 

My friends both ordered the filet mignon. They were both happy with it, stating it was buttery fall off your fork tender. It came with crushed potatoes aka mashed- they were good, but nothing to write home about and I think green beans. 

Lastly, I ordered as a treat the Key Lime Tart with blackberry compote sauce, vanilla Chantilly, lime zest and a fresh blackberry. My favorite thing about key lime pie is the contrast and merge of flavors between the sweet, dry graham cracker crust and the tart key lime filling. The blackberry was a fresh, juicy reminder of another natural fruit flavor. I initially ordered it to-go, but ended up eating it all after tasting it in the to-go box! My comrades both opted for the s'mores cheesecake with graham cracker crust. The marshmallows are made in-house and surprisingly a toasted dark chocolate fudge cocoa nib is placed in the middle of each one. 

Our waiter K.T. was very polite, engaging, kept our drinks refreshed and checked in frequently. Nick, the owner also visited our table after the chicken wing fiasco. He was pleasant and apologetic. 

Good atmosphere, decent food and would consider returning!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice: once to sit at the bar and watch the Pacquiao/Mayweather fight and another to have brunch. The night of the fight we enjoyed chatting with the friendly bartenders and eating the complimentary popcorn. The popcorn is unexpectedly spicy, so at first it was off-putting, but holy hell, it became addictive. 

For brunch we weren't hungry so we nixed the buffet. Looked good though, especially the raw bar. I ordered the grilled blackened salmon which is served over sauteed spinach and a delicious fried beet. Overall, the brunch was good.

It's convenient to the East/West station of the light rail. It's got a decent-sized parking lot too. I live a mile away so I'll be back one day to try the brunch buffet."}
{"text":"They did an excellent job remodeling the old Vinnys. We sat on the dining room side.. was good at first but then a table of 5 sat next to us that were very loud/obnixious.. later some sort of holiday party arrived and my friend and I could no longer talk because we could not hear each other. 
The spicy popcorn was on point... I would have ordered an app if I had not filled up on it so its almost a lose for the resturant. I had the burger with mojito fries... was not asked how I wanted it cooked, the receipt said 'medium well' so not sure if the waitress chose or thats the only option (it did not come out medium well either thankfully).. the lettuce was put on the hot burger so it was a wilty mess.. waitress had mentioned I could have 'no lettuce' but didnt say why, figured it out when I received it. I had the mojio fries as the said, loved the flavors but I believe the fries were frozen. For a smaller place with a smaller menu I would expect fresh cut in house fries. Friend had the french dip and sweet potato waffle fries.. her fries were good, I assume also frozen but not sure. Nothing was really memorable... I would go back again to try a few more menu items... would like to have seen a little more creativity/options on the menu.. I think the apps were the most creative. I would also sit at the bar or on the bar side and avoid that dining room unless you are the loud/obnixious people :-)"}
{"text":"Heard mixed reviews but went for Sunday brunch after friends highly recommended it.  Service was good and pleasant - atmosphere/decor good but the food was highly disappointing.  The brunch buffet bar was completely empty.......they were clearly not prepared for the crowd.  Rather than wait I ordered something off the menu.  Blackened salmon benedict......2 micro size pieces of salmon served next to a dry muffin and overcooked greens with a lackluster sauce.  My friends waited on the buffet refill but the food was disappointing.  Overall not impressed."}
{"text":"We went to Nan and Byron's last night and sat in the front room. We were absolutely starving and glad they could take us right away with no reservation. 

I ordered the meatloaf, which had sriracha ketchup and it was delicious. For my sides I had peas and carrots and mojito fries. Yes, that's right. Mojito. Fries. It's like a hint of lime chip but a little more sophisticated. Yummy.

I gave it 4 and not 5 stars because I asked for Brussels sprouts since many yelpers were raving about them. She said they were seasonal. I asked if there was a comparable vegetable equally good right now. She said no and said since it's Sunday they didn't really have much. Your restaurant is open 7 days per week, no? A restaurant of this status (especially one that offers 2 vegetable sides with each meal) should offer seasonal/green/good options on each day of the week."}
{"text":"I had high hopes, I really did.  I wanted to love this place but I just had a so-so experience.  I do plan on returning and will update this review when I do!!

When I first walked in I immediately fell in LOVE with the atmosphere.  It was intimate and swanky and I loved the soft lighting provided by the tea lights at each table.  The vibe was definitely \"cool\" and the offer the perfect setting for a date or a girl's night out.  

The basket of popcorn offered before the meal was unique.  Don't get me wrong, I ate the whole thing and then some...but I'm not sure I felt it fit with the overall atmosphere.  

Anyway, on to the main meal...

We started with the Peppedew Poppers.  They were very good.  They had great flavor and they weren't too \"hot/spicy\" which I appreciated.  They were served with some sort of dill sauce and it just made the whole picture complete.  It was very tasty.

I ordered the Peruvian style roasted chicken which has the bone in and was sitting on a cilantro based cream sauce.  I was given the choice of two sides and I went for the baked beans and sweet potato fries.  Let me just say this meal was wonderful.  The chicken was tender, seasoned perfectly and fell off the bone.  It was juicy and there was plenty of meat.  The baked beans were okay and the fries were waffle sweet potato fries which was unique and still good.  I wish they came with some type of dipping sauce though because every other sauce/dressing I tried was incredible..why stop at the fries?  So that all sounds great right?  So, what's my beef?  Well, the meal came out lukewarm to cold which was NOT okay.  I didn't want to complain so I continued to eat the meal but I know it could have been so much better.  

My friend ordered the meatloaf with mac n cheese and the mojito fries.  Her meal came out room temperature at BEST.  She was not as gracious as I and she told the server (who took forever to even check on our meals) that this meal was literally cold.  The mac n cheese was super bland and the mojito fries didn't seem very mojitoish (if I may).  They were good fries but nothing special.  The server said he could take her plate back and \"warm it up\" which just didn't sound appetizing to my picky dining partner.  What was he going to do?  Nuke it?  No thanks.  Meatloaf can swing either way so the thought of cold meatloaf being reheated in the microwave pretty much made her and our table nauseous.  He apologized and offered to bring her something else.  She opted for the house salad that came with a peach vinaigrette.  Once again, FAIL.  The salad was just bare.  It was lettuce with some dressing.  There wasn't even a crouton.  Looking back on the menu I realize it doesn't promise anything more but geez!

The waiter apologized for the inconvenience but it wasn't very convincing to be honest.  About 20 minutes or so later a manager finally meanders over and apologizes in somewhat of a smug fashion.  He said he heard we weren't satisfied with the meatloaf and wanted us to know he took care of it on the bill.  I know that in theory is the \"right\" thing to do but for being a local restaurant with a lot of hype, I expected better customer service.  I mean, no kidding she isn't going to pay for the meal.  She took one bite of the fleshy cold meatloaf.  They still made it seem like it was HER issue, not theirs.  They should have offered a free dessert, a free beer, just something that made them seem to care a bit more and it didn't happen.  In their defense, they didn't know my meal was cold as well.

We did end up ordering the vanilla bean cheesecake that was covered in a salted carmel sauce.  It was good.  It was rich, creamy, small portioned but good.

While we were waiting for our check we noticed the table in front of us sent their food back.  As we were leaving we asked why and they said because it was COLD!!  They ordered the meatloaf and the prime rib!!  They said management handled it very well so they were pleased with their experience but both sent their entrees back. 

I don't know if Nan just had an off night or if they were backed up in the kitchen, short staffed, etc.  I can think of all types of excuses but I didn't have the best experience unfortunately.

I still plan on returning because I think they have some great menu items, they are reasonably priced, have a decent wine list and I love the atmosphere.  I just hope my next visit is a bit more satisfying!!"}
{"text":"I am going to return to Nan & Byrons, because I know they deserve another shot, but this experience was a little \"meh\".

We stopped in for sunday brunch before noon, with a reservation, hoping we'd miss a bit of the crowd. They sat five of us on a four-top that barely had room for four once you add in the amount of beverages usually consumed at breakfast (water/tea or coffee/juice), but we managed. 

I ordered an orange juice first, then my sister ordered an orange juice a few minutes later. Mine came in a tall glass with ice and by the looks of it looked fresh squeezed (or I was hoping that's what the separation of water and juice meant) hers arrived in a short glass without ice, perfectly mixed together.

Our server had never worked a brunch before so she couldn't answer any questions about the menu. She also didn't know how to add an egg to a breakfast (someone wanted three eggs, only two arrived on the plate), and when someone wanted their eggs \"well done\" (half jokingly), she never clarified and just rang them in as over easy. I asked if the side of fruit was just a simple market diced melon/pineapple blend and she said yes, actually it comes with yogurt and granola on top. Not the end of the world for me, but some people might not want that. 

My mother's entree came out with a few of the appetizers, so when we were all eating our main dishes my mother was left eating her tiny side of garlic shrimp. It was a little sad. While she was (slowly) eating her shrimp, my fiance was attempting to eat his charred, dried up sausage, I was trying to figure out how one of my eggs was barely poached while the other was a solid mass (I can't even say poached \"hard\", it was further gone than that) on top of my barely warm beet benedict, and another guest was a little hungry without his third egg and had to ask for a side of sriracha ketchup three times. 

Yes, I loved the beets. I want to order them again, but I want them to be hot. I'd even take luke-warm. The french toast went over well. There were some highlights, but almost $20/person without a beverage for brunch demands more, especially being charged for the sriracha ketchup. 

And does anyone know what the donation line is for on the bill? Who am I donating to?? There wasn't any information about it anywhere, and that seems weird to me."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorites in South End. It can be great for a casual lunch with a friend, or for a nicer date night. Their burgers are amazing (especially when topped with pimento cheese and served with a side of mac & cheese In addition, their Sunday brunch has something for everybody, no matter what mood you're in. The space is decorated nicely and the service from the staff is absolutely great. I'll continue to be a regular here. When I can't make up my mind on where to go for dinner, I always choose N&B's as it's always a safe bet! 

If you're visiting or new to the area, give this place a try! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"My wife and my daughter and I gave Nan & Byron's a try for their Sunday Brunch buffet. Nice selection with a few of the usual items - scrambled eggs, sausage links, bacon, biscuits, grits - and a few that were a bit more unusual including a huge tray of oysters, large shrimp, meatloaf squares and a good few things made with sweet potatoes.

I particularly enjoyed the shrimp (with a New Orleans remoulade, but would have preferred a classic cocktail sauce) and the sweet potato au gratin. Sliced salmon was good too, but I didn't really feel like waiting for the toaster to toast.

Service was okay with a waiter who refilled Diet Coke often but coffee not as much. I think he was maybe disappointed that we didn't go all in for the refillable mimosas or bloody marys. We're not all booze drinkers, ya know?

Parking's challenging with a small lot but there are some spots to be found on the street."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on a Friday.  When we arrived the hostess was on the phone, but was quick to seat us after she hung up.

We were seated in the dining room, which at the time, was maybe 20% full.  By the time we left around 1:00pm, the dining room was completely full.  I like the layout and the feel of the dining room with lots of natural light coming in from the windows and the garage door.

We started with an app of Train Wreck Fries ($10), which our waiter said was the perfect size for a group of four (which was the exact number of people in our party!).  I was disappointed that when the fries came out, the dish was significantly smaller than I expected.  The taste was decent, but not worth the money.

For my entree, I chose the Meatloaf Sandwich (sans mayo) with mac and cheese as my side.  The sandwich arrived looking pretty on a brioche bun (which is the bread used in all sandwiches, per our waiter).  I was excited because of the siracha ketchup that was on the sandwich, but was disappointed that the amount was too small to make a taste impact (they did provide additional siracha ketchup on request).  The taste was good, but didn't wow me.  I think the sandwich would have been better with a thicker slice of meatloaf which would better the meat-to-bun ratio.  I liked the mac and cheese (cavatappi noodles) the cheese was smooth and the portion was a good size.

I'm glad that I got a chance to visit, but I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"I feel robbed of food and service. Ordered a veggie egg white omelette, came out with yolks. Server brought me out a new one with egg whites only and shortly afterwards a manager came out and said my meal would be comped (hence the 2 stars). Veggie omelette has very few vegetables and was greasy. Yuck. 

Others at the table complained the food was so so. I was shocked by the expensive prices at this place. Not worth it.

When it was time for the bill, we told our server we wanted one check. ANOTHER server comes out with 3 separate bills. I had to tell the server the manager comped my meal and that we asked for one check.

Horrible service. So many other restaurants in South End where your money will be well spent. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"A great find!! My sister and I have been looking around Charlotte for a place to get good cocktails (the perfect old fashioned to be specific) and some appetizers/tapas to munch on. I'm not usually a foodie, but our bartender's (Phil) recommendations were addictive and my sister and I each had more cocktails than we planned on they were just too good! We have made Nan and Byron's a regular spot thanks to this experience.

Recommendations: Cadillac Jalapeno Margarita, Refashioned, Porcini Mushroom Ravioli, Sushi Grade Tuna Tartare"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is cool, service was average, food is pretty good, but pricy for what you get.

Best tip about this place: get the deviled eggs app!"}
{"text":"The poppers were alright, and managed to keep us satiated until our entrees came out.

The maglev at the bar is way better than the cabernet. The cabernet lacked any body and fell flat as a red.

I ordered the meatloa and was underwhelmed. There's nothing special with it. The Mac and cheese was bland with no creaminess. The sweet potato fries were crispy and standard. However, it's a good value as an entree that comes with two sides.

My friend got the steak, which caused immediate envy amongst pout table. A thick slab of prime rib roast on the border of rare and medium rare. I had a few bites and it was full of fresh beef flavor, much better than the meatloaf.

The service was lovely, and that really is a huge part of dining. Not a bad place, but the good can use a little more love."}
{"text":"We had a weekend brunch there. They give you an option with a buffet or regular menu. Buffet is a little pricy, but worth if you have a drink. If you are taking a Bloody Mary or Mimosa, definitely consider a buffet, cause a drink itself isn't big. I had  Eggs Benedict, it was very yummy, it doesn't come with a side, but it was enough for me."}
{"text":"My wife and I went the Nan and Byron's on Saturday night with friends of ours. We started with drinks at the bar (beer and margarita) and the margarita was good (as was the beer). After a 35-40 minute wait we were finally sat for dinner. 

We ordered the poblano pepper dip and the poppers, bot of which were really good. And they were willing to bring move chips for they dip which made that even more enjoyable.

For dinner, my wife got the Pork and I got the Meatloaf. The Pork was very bland while also very sweet, but not in a good way. The Meatloaf was like bark and the supposed sriracha ketchup tasted like Heinz ketchup. 

Collectively, we decided that the food was better suited for room service. 

Lastly, we couldn't figure out the concept for the restaurant. It seems like they want to be southern, but then the menu doesn't fit that. 

Overall, Nan and Byron's is not worth the trip. Go to 300 east around the corner for a better meal."}
{"text":"Nan & Byron's did not disappoint when we went for dinner on NYE. Tried several appetizer's and chose the steak for my entree. After grazing on appetizer's I did have a difficult time selecting a healthy side option that leaned more towards a green veggie. Opted for the Kitchen Sink salad for an up charge, and it was superb! The service was top notch and the hostess's were very welcoming and down to earth. We definitley will return!"}
{"text":"What a fun birthday celebration! I had only been to N&B's for a Yelp event, so I was excited to actually have a dinner. We grabbed a table outside, which is quite pleasant even though you're basically in the parking lot. The entire night our server was on point. She was friendly, but not too much, quick and helpful when it came to offering up dinner suggestions. The manager even came over to check on our meal. We made reservations and ate early, around 6:30. I would recommend this, considering this place tends to get busy. I really like the decor of N&B's- cozy with a twist. 
Now on to the food... 
We all ordered the red wine blend that was on special, perfect way to start off the night, follow by their complementary popcorn... spicy and a little odd, but not bad, just not expected. We ordered the poblano cheese dip. Wow, It's heavy like you would expect and served with homemade chips, the only problem, you may completely ruin your appetite with this appetizer. 

On to the main dishes- Between the meatloaf, tacos and my pork chops, everything was great. Heavy southern dishes all with a modern add on spicy grits and salmon tacos. The only downside, the majority of the menu was very heavy. I didn't think they had a lot of lighter options to choose from. The menu is a little on the pricier side- ranging from 18-30 dollars for an entrée, but I do think the pricing is justified. 

The night was sealed with a sweet treat of turtle Cheesecake, on the house.... What a nice surprise, they even wrote Colin a birthday card and gave up a coupon for a return visit. Damn, that is some good marketing!"}
{"text":"So I finally made it to Nan & Byron's for dinner and had the opportunity to try their meatloaf.  Actually the key words there are \"Had the opportunity\" for when I asked the server what to try, I went with the chicken instead.   But more on that later.

The place is noisy.  We were seated in the bar area and it was cramped and crowded with bar patrons surrounding our table.  It was not the best place for a dinner group which had reservations. 

Now the chicken was amazing.  The skin was crispy and the flavorful and the chicken itself was so tender.  The sides I ordered were mac n cheese and corn.  Both were small portions and both were quite meh.

Service-wise, I thought they were off.  Water glasses went unfilled.  I waited 20 minutes for a 2nd beer.  I asked for extra green sauce for my chicken and that took forever as well.

I am not ruling out another trip to N&B's but I think I'll stick to late lunches and the beet burger.  The service is much better.  It was less busy and much quieter so you could actually hear conversations."}
{"text":"Nan and Byron's is a great spot. It has a rustic old wood and iron kind of feel. A few friends and I hit it up today (Sunday) for brunch. The brunch menu offers a $21 dollar brunch buffet that offers what seems like a bunch of great options, especially the seafood/raw bar options. The buffet also comes with a free first drink - either a bloody mary or mimosa. After that they are each $2.50. If you don't get the buffet your first bloody mary is $9 or $7 for a mimosa and you still get the discount of $2.50 after that. 

None of us were in a buffet mood, so we just ordered meals off the a la carte menu. I would like to come back another time and try the buffet though now that I know what they have. 

Two of my friends got bloody mary's and one got a mimosa. I will say that I think the drinks are TINY, especially for $9 for your first. Even my friend said that it was good, but not $9 good. The bloody mary was nothing special. Even when it came to the table there was no garnish or anything in the drink. Others sitting at the bar that we saw had a garnish of a pickle or olive or something. I also noticed in pictures on here that others had garnish as well. 

One of my friends got an omelette where you pick the ingredients you would like in it and it comes with home fries/breakfast potatoes. The other three of us got the breakfast burger which was basically a bacon cheeseburger with an egg on top. When you order, you order how you would like your burger cooked and how you would like the egg cooked. Both came out perfect! It was so good, You could tell that the burger was fresh (not frozen) meat. The egg yolk ran just the right amount to cover the burger and give it that breakfast flair! I would recommend trying it!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice. Once for lunch once for dinner great service and food both times. French dip and Mac and cheese are awesome."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was cool, very cozy farmhouse style with reclaimed wood tables and Edison light bulbs. 

The waitstaff and management were very friendly, but not hovering. Although it was odd that all of the waitstaff were lined up in the dining room like they were waiting to pounce if your fork was laid down or your drink was a little empty!

 As for the food it was just ok. Not great not bad. I had the braised pork with Mac and Cheese which were both kind of bland. My husband had the  roasted chicken and veggies. All fresh! Simple but good.

The menu selections were simple but if done well could be good."}
{"text":"The best part of the whole experience was the wine because it was half off.  When I arrived, there was a huge party taking up the entire bar area - which has happened the past two times that I have been there.  It seems they would put the party in the back room, but instead they took up the whole restaurant.  I ordered the tacos which were a joke.  They came in cheap flimsy tortillas and although I ordered what I thought would be \"steak\" tacos, it came out as ground beef.  I seriously could've gotten better tacos at Taco Bell and wouldn't have to pay $15.  Or I could've made better ones at home from a box.  I thought about sending my meal back, but I hate doing that.  I ate the popcorn because I didn't want the tacos.  Disappointing experience from what I thought would be one of the better upscale places on South Blvd.  My last experience was just as bad, but I thought I would give it a second shot.   I will not be returning."}
{"text":"In a nutshell, good food marred by bad service.

It started with a hostess who seemed annoyed by her job and decided to seat all the tables next to each other even though there was plenty of space in the restaurant.  Our waiter was personable, but failed to tell us about any specials or give us a drink menu and when we asked, he described their Queen's Feast dinner offering which was strange since we were there for lunch.

We ordered the chicken soup, a side of green beans, and the famous beet burger.  We also let him know that we were in a hurry (due to a meeting) and if he could please expedite our order.  He was smiles all around, assuring us he would.  The popcorn came out quickly, so we munched and waited.  And waited.  And waited.

If this had been a full restaurant I would have understood the delay, but it was well after the lunch rush and there were no large groups seated before us.  When the food finally arrived, my girl had to immediately return her soup. The waiter had put his thumb on the inside of the bowl while carrying it over to our table.  That's a huge screw up.  When we sent it back he didn't even ask why.  Another service faux pas.  

The beet burger was as good as everyone said it was and the green beans were nice if a bit salty.  When half-way done with our food we asked for the check.  Again, we were in a hurry and let the waiter know this.  So we waited.  And waited.  There's nothing more infuriating than needing to be at an appointment and watching your waiter shoot the breeze with a colleague instead of printing out your check.

He finally drops the check off and disappears.  I put my card onto their clipboard then tried to grab his attention.  He was nowhere to be found.  I was reaching the boiling point when my girl just got up from the table, tracked him down, and handed him our check.  After all this BS you can imagine what my tip was.

Our lunch was disappointing.  Even though the beet burger was fantastic, I couldn't really enjoy it because I was so pissed off at the inconsiderate service.  If the place had been slammed I would have understood, but this wasn't even a half full restaurant.

No clue if we'll go back.  Their menu is tempting, but what's the point when the piss poor service makes your stomach turn?"}
{"text":"Trying new places during restaurant week can always be hit or miss. Nan and Byron's is a big HIT! Excellent staff, we let them know it was an anniversary, they noted it, sent champagne , an anniversary card and small app. Of marinated strawberry and cheese , small touches that made an impression before the food even hit the table and The food was incredible! We had the crispy oysters app, the hanger steak  and the scallops both came with creative side dishes loaded with flavor. Along with its very comfortable (on a hot humid night) indoor outdoor dinning areas it was a HIT all around . Already looking forward to going back with friends."}
{"text":"I have many other places I could spend 50 dollars for brunch for 2 people!  They ran out of fried chicken before 1 pm. The buffet was just OK."}
