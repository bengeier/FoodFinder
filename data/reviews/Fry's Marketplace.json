{"text":"I have never had such a horrible shopping experience. Not only were there two employees in an aisle that just stared me down without moving so I couldn't get down the aisle, when I checked out I had to bag my own groceries while I saw four employees behind the registers just talking, and a \"supervisor\" pushed past my cart (pushing it into me) so she could get past me without even acknowledging my presence, or the fact that perhaps I could use some help with the $150 of groceries that I was bagging from her store. I WILL NEVER SHOP HERE AGAIN! There is always (always) something wrong with this store, from the abandoned boxes of groceries always in the aisles and blocking the food to the just abysmal customer service. If this was a one time thing I would forgive it, but after being yelled at the previous time for having 16 items in my cart (in a 15 or less) by a woman who wasn't doing anything and wasn't taking care of anyone else to almost tripping over the carpet and wet spots by the soda machines, I have had it. Just awful. Oh, and half their produce is always bad, so make sure to check it carefully."}
{"text":"I completely dig this grocery, well as much as a dude can dig a grocery store.  I just happen to always go here because it is so close."}
{"text":"Always have a nice shopping experience here, friendly cashiers, and they make sure you get out quick, rarely is there a lane with more then  3 people waiting. They get 4 stars for not having a starbucks inside."}
{"text":"Every time I have to pick up a prescription from the pharmacy is a nightmare! They take forever!!! I always need to call to make sure they start working on my order.  The stuff in this pharmacy just don't care. Horrible customer service!"}
{"text":"Great service! Great neighborhood and area. No paranoid constitutionists walking around with big guns on their hip. Everyone is conscientious and keeps their weapons concealed. Overall a great shopping experience. The Starbucks inside is also good."}
{"text":"I've been here 2 or 3 times now 1 hour before closing time. The cashiers close up their registers to leave the selfserve registers open. It is very difficult to check out when you buy large quanities of food here. I do not know of other supermarkets that do this. It seems rude to close up so early. 1 star for eye rolling employees."}
{"text":"I go here all the time because it's the closest store to me. I am amazed by how many times in a row something will be out of stock that I'm shopping for. Even worsely, the pharmacy is terrible at stocking even medicines that I receive each month. I am always so shocked and disappointed when they repeatedly don't prepare for my refills or are ill prepared for a new one or equipment such as a teaspoon syringe to administer med to my baby this week. Also the drive thru window for the pharmacy is taken advantage of and I've literally seen one car sit there for over 30 minutes before as I'm stuck behind them and in front of someone that blocked me in. If the script isn't ready, have them come back, not sit and take everyone else's time too! Plus to fill a script takes several hours here. I dropped one off at Walgreens last night and they just needed 15 min. My family and I are taking all of our prescriptions to Walgreens for now on!"}
{"text":"I love love love this store. It's always clean, everyone is friendly and helpful and I can always find what I need. So much so that I can usually never get out of there for less than $100. They've got a computer for inputting your deli order so that you don't have to wait at the counter. Just enter what you want and they'll get it ready while you shop. Their produce section is usually very good (the only exception has been the sweet potatoes are lacking a bit lately, which is probably because they're not really in season), and the seafood and meat counters always have really fresh stuff.

Since it's a Marketplace, there is also a home goods section but I try to stay out of there. I may end up buying the whole store."}
{"text":"This place is the MECA of good prices and friendly service. A wine bar? I didn't go-but grandma did! :)"}
{"text":"Great store, I do all of my grocery shopping here.  The employees are nice and extremely helpful."}
{"text":"This store is incredible.   Everything is done right!  The produce section, the deli, the sushi, Starbucks inside; all are outstanding.  I wish we had a Fry's in San Diego.  When I lived in AZ. I used to shop at Fry's all of the time but wow...they have really taken a grocery store to a whole new level.  This actually makes shopping  fun.  Prices are amazing, nice wide aisles, pleasant lighting, extremely friendly staff.  In addition to the usual grocery items they have a large selection of other items including minor automotive, household items etc and great gas prices.

I can only think of one possible addition and that would be to have the deli make a couple of breakfast sandwich options in the morning to go with your Starbucks coffee.  I think this would be a big hit for those people who are doing a quick stop in or live nearby and are looking for another fast and simple breakfast option.

Lastly, the parking lot is huge with no other competing businesses.  

It's exciting to see a business doing everything right!"}
{"text":"Not sure what I can really say about a grocery store. This one is bigger than the average store. Cool, all the better."}
{"text":"Tonight I went into the store with my two children, we used the self checkout. When we went to ring up our two items, like always something did not ring up the posted price. I entered my VIP number however it was still wrong. I called the clerk(Amber) over who I found to be very condescending and rude. She asked me how much the posted amount was and I told her.  She said she would need to check that out herself. I followed her back to the area and neither her or I could find ANY signs or prices that confirmed the price it was ringing up. She then said , I'm going to have to go with price it's ringing up as.  I asked for a manager. I waited in the aisle for the manager when he arrived he was very nice and he determined that I was Right about the price and he honored it. Here's the problem.  Well I was in the back waiting for the manager, Amber decided to Bad mouth me to another employee. Amber stated \" if she thought I was going to let her get that for the price she said, seriously she's wrong.\" She took pride in telling the other employee how she was pleased with herself for giving  me attitude??? She ended the conversation with \"SERIOUSLY I JUST LOVE  PEOPLE\" and then rolled her eyes. Well, you may be wondering how I know this information since I was in the back of the store.  Unfortunately   Amber proceed to have this entire conversation as she belittled and bad mouthed me without the knowledge that my adult children were standing  in the  self ckeck area and they overheard every rude comment she made about me. I reported her  to the Manager but he didn't seem to really care about this girls unprofessionalism. I Hope Amber doesn't treat all her customers this way!!! If she doesn't LIKE people maybe she shouldn't  work around them. I believe she needs to retake the Customer Service training!!!!"}
{"text":"This ribs are so good when you BBQ them this Labor Day weekend,  I am highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We just recently returned from vacation. During our vacation we shopped at several stores from our hometown. We couldn't wait to get back home and shop in Fry's. The store is always clean , well organized and staffed appropriately.  I joked with my sister that I can now shop for food, booze, amazing sushi and get a pair of tennis shoes In one place. Thanks Frys's"}
{"text":"My favorite Fry's location.  In addition to a large selection of groceries, there's a little bit of everything else here, like dishes, small kitchen appliances, home decor, clothing, and a fairly large cosmetics department.  Customer service is usually pretty good."}
{"text":"I have been shopping here for a year but it was so poorly stocked tonight I left half a cart in the isle and went to winco. The shelves were bare."}
{"text":"Pretty much done with this store. Between the poor attitude of the employees, and the sub standard produce.....this place is way over rated. I'll go out of my way , and go to Albertsons & Winco......."}
{"text":"Maybe today wasn't a day to shop here ,I love  frys ,here daily , great food choice , I always find it here 
First stop Starbucks, maybe I should have stop here , the girl today was really not friendly at at , granted she was the only one working , taking orders and making them , but really no smile, no hi , just \"what's your order\"bam here's your drink , can't remember her name but it did start with \"V\"
Then on to shopping for a few things I needed , last stop deli , one other man there , getting his order , lots of workers chatting , that's all good , then one person from the deli looks right at me and says , did you grab a number , well you might do it , I said really , only me and him ,. She wasn't going to help  me unless I had a number , by the look on here face , I walked away ,yes it understand the numbers and I do grab them , but in most  cases they don't even follow the numbers and today wasn't like I was going to get list in the shuffle ,
It must be to close to Thanksgiving for these workers . I think I will stick together one on combs, they go above and beyond to help out .."}
{"text":"They claim to have lower prices... nope. They just mismark items so you don't realize it until AFTER you have checked out. Third time it's happened. Done with Fry's. Worth the drive to WinCo."}
{"text":"Wade, the Assistant Manager, was so helpful today!  I was stranded in the grocery store's parking lot with two tired kiddos and needed help.  He used his personal phone (as there was no phone book available) to look up numbers and provide recommendations for auto help.  Thank you Wade for your kindness, generosity and amazing customer service!  Just another reason to shop at my neighborhood Fry's!"}
{"text":"This particular Fry's is my grocery of choice.  It is still fairly new and has a large offering of all kinds of food, housewares, pharmacy, etc.  The staff at this location is helpful and friendly.  As of late, the produce has been less than good and that is why I am deducting a star.  Other than that, the store is very clean and bright.  Fry's Marketplace is definitely my favorite of the chains and I will continue to shop there often.

Tip: Avoid this store like the plague on the first Wednesday of every month.  That is senior discount day and it is extremely crowded."}
{"text":"Awesome service from all the staffs especially fish/meat department.  Great produce, fruits and love the sushi guys.  Sushi guys know their customer service.  When they didn't have the Unagi I was disappointed.  I asked them if they were going to have any they said give us few minutes and they made it fresh for me.  Best grocery store and I love the discount I get at their gas station.   I just wish they had covered parking that would be soooo awesome!!!"}
{"text":"I experienced excellent customer service today at the courtesy counter. This is my home store and I love Frys market place."}
{"text":"Great store. Friendly staff. New lower prices are welcome!! Good produce and meats. Nice flower shop on site and now a Starbucks for the coffee crowd. Convenient gas station out by higley rd"}
{"text":"Pharmacy tech was unfriendly and there were no notifications when prescriptions were ready.  I waited in front of the counter and was not told when my prescription was ready.  I had to go up to the counter 3 times in 45 minutes before it was ready."}
{"text":"As far as the grocery section of this store is concerned,  it is pretty nice - seems like they might be having trouble adapting to a Kroger plan-o-gram, as items are hard to find and their placement in the store doesn't always make sense.  The staff is as courteous as any I've encountered since moving here. 
Now -about the pharmacy - totally different attitudes and staff doesn't seem aware of what they are doing.  I had my prescriptions transferred from Kroger in Ohio - they were good until February 2015.  Three of them Fry's refilled and noted \"no refills\" on the bottles; even though my doctor had approved.  They did not have one of my medications and said they had to order it.  That was okay with me.  This was on a Tuesday and I was told the medication would be available on Friday.  I went back on Friday and the pharmacy worker told me that the order had come in but hadn't been unpacked yet.  At no time did he offer to go and get it for me.  I asked him what the cost was going to be (since I have new insurance) and he said, \"$25.00\".  On Saturday I went back to get it; and the woman pharmacy manager told me a price that was almost 10 times the one I was quoted the day before.  I pointed at the young man who had given me that price, and she said, \"How would he know?\"  I pointed out to her that he was looking in the same computer she was.  She turned to him and he looked at me and said he had never told me that...now, come  on, folks, I didn't pull that price out of thin air.

To make a long story short, Walgreen's now has a new customer.  Go for groceries but steer clear of the pharmacy if you can...I would have been a bit appeased if someone had apologized and said it was an error - but I was offered no explanation or apology...guess the customer doesn't matter to the pharmacy techs."}
{"text":"This is literally my favorite frys ever. The frys on Gilbert and ocotillo is obviously lit but this frys is still my favorite I'm so attached hahaha"}
{"text":"This is a great grocery store!  It is super clean and always seems to have those hard to find ingredients!  The wine special is pretty awesome too!!"}
{"text":"This grocery store is massive! They have anything and everything you need. The only downside is on the busy weekends the produce goes extremely quickly. The fish and meat is always a lot fresher than other frys. I love this store!"}
{"text":"I tried the ClickList, order your own groceries on the website and then pick them up.  I really liked this service.  It was very easy to order online and then just go pick up your stuff.  I love having this option!"}
{"text":"I like Fry's because they have a good produce section that is usually well stocked. I also like that they have a larger health food section than most grocery stores. They also carry furniture and home goods which are fun to look at."}
{"text":"This store has really friendly staff and practically everything you're looking for. 

Recently, we've started using the Click List for all our grocery shopping. The staff is super friendly and deliveries groceries right to my vehicle. 

They let me know exactly how the order went and if they were unable to get something on my list. 

Love this store."}
{"text":"My favorite grocery store! The staff is very friendly and helpful (aside from a couple cashiers I avoid, like red-vest Courtney), the sales are terrific, the interior and exterior are very clean, and the gas points are a nice little bonus."}
{"text":"The deli was pretty busy tonight, they have our favorite boars head meats which we only eat; turkey and chicken with all the flavors. 

The deli baristas are slicing, weighing, wrapping and bagging all in sync with the ebb and flow of deli customers with their number in hand.  

We do not mix our meats and Regina was ready and willing to clean her machine and let us pick and sample our many choices.

Most Kroger family groceries have a deli 
and often have boars head and we have tried many in different states, so we are familiar with their Delis.

I say all that to say how much we appreciate the service we received.  Regina went above and beyond our expectations, we never felt rushed, but well served in ever enter action.

We will be back."}
{"text":"This is a review for the Starbucks inside. I ordered a Vanilla Rooibos  tea from an employee named Taylor. (A branded item from Starbucks) Taylor said, \"This ain't Dutch bros lady!\" I was appalled. I let him
know it was a drink Starbucks has and he said he didn't know how to make it with a rude tone. I was so blown away by the rudeness and lack of customer service I left and went to the Starbucks down the street at Bashas."}
