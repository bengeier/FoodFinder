{"text":"So good last Saturday that we came again this Saturday. I saw the reviews for the great fresh made food but when I got to the place I thought I had the wrong address because it looks a little empty/ deserted. DONT LET THAT FOOL YOU - TRY IT!! It's nothing to look at, and the menu is small, but it's thoughtfully put together, and the food is fresh, tasty, plenteous, YUM!! We tried the breakfast burrito (homemade tortilla, heaps of fresh potato hash, eggs, bacon...) and the croque Monsieur with jalapeños (perfect comfort food, creamy, just the right amounts of ham, sauce, cheese, thick bread, toasted - with a fresh salad and homemade dressing) - and today tried the chilaquiles and steak quesadilla. Both excellent. Good music, clean, helpful staff. They are newly open so don't expect perfect operations yet, but a great community diner."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Other reviewers are right, not much to look at from the outside, but don't let that deter you!  Hubby ordered the chilaquiles,  we both agreed it was our favorite! Smoky and spicy, absolutely delicious. I ordered the huevos rancheros and that was also amazing. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Um, yum! Read all the great reviews and I decided to stop in for the blackened fish tacos. Service, portion size, price and food was great! I will def stop into this new, hidden gem from time to time. I stopped in for dinner solo and hopped on the free wifi to knock out some adulting.   Anyone who says anything but AMAZE things about this place is a hater. #DontBeOneOfThosePpl"}
{"text":"My guy and I went for breakfast and it was awesome!! He got the biscuits and gravy, the gravy was very flavorful and just the right consistency. The biscuits were also tasty! I ordered the chilaquiles and I am not joking when I say they're as good as my mom's, and that says a lot! This place is very new and I look forward to sharing it with my friends and family. Can't wait to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Please do not let the exterior turn you away.  This restaurant has some of the best authentic mexican food.  It is a family business that takes pride in their food and service.  They are very friendly and personally interact with you to ensure the food is great.  The portions are big, and  served hot and fresh.  Overlook the exterior and give them a try, you will be happy with both the food and service!"}
{"text":"loved the tacos! the location is perfect for brunch. right off central and southern."}
{"text":"So I've been reading all these reviews about this location for some time and I figured let me give it a shot. I will tell from the outside it doesn't look appealing but that's never stopped me before, some of the best restaurants are whole in the walls.    I will tell you that if you order the breakfast burrito you better have a good appetite because that thing is loaded with all sorts of good stuff I had to call it quits on half of it. The taste was great I would order it again, I like how it has thick slices of bacon in it.  My wife ordered the French toast and by far i think that it ranks high up with one of the best French toast that I have ever had, the fruit that's on top makes it.   I would definitely eat here again, the family running it seem very nice and friendly and I'm glad to have a nice breakfast joint next to home, who know I might even explore there regular menu.  Im giving them 4 stars just because I ordered online and my order wasn't ready, but I will add that they were super friendly and made it right, it's hard to find places like this.   So please support your local business and give them a far shot just like I did you won't be disappointed.  Ps i will be back to give you a far shot at 5 stars"}
{"text":"This is a greasy spoon. It's good. Food was a bit well done...borderline burnt bacon. But fine for the price. What is strange is that the building is an old Burger King. They made little effort to hide that. The building is dilapidated and and the roof obviously leaks. The play area from the old Burger King makes the place look odd for a restaurant. Needs some TLC."}
{"text":"We've been back several times now.  Unfortunately some of the other items on the menu were not as satisfying as the ceviche blanco - which is a standout dish.  The burger was too salty and just so-so (Along with the fries).  The beef burrito came with red sauce and cabbage (like on a fish taco).  The cabbage did not go well with the sauce or the beef.    The service is always very attentive and it continues to be a nice place to go."}
{"text":"Great food Don't let the exterior fool you this place has great service and excellent food. Support this business"}
{"text":"I stopped in today for the steak tacos, and they were delicious. The two tacos were bigger than I expected and came with rice and beans. The side salsa was tasty, too. The service was very good as well. They came by more than once to check how I was doing. I will definitely? be back!"}
{"text":"The breakfast burrito is top notch as you could taste all of the fresh ingredients like potatoes, bacon & green peppers etc. ....along with the little bit of gravy that is also inside of it.  The only slight negative is one that I talked to one of the owners about and that is the fact that the taste of their coffee was good...but it would have tasted better if they used real coffee cups and not styrofoam cups."}
{"text":"Delicious food, huge servings, fantastic coffee. Great music. Great staff. If I lived in the area I'd frequent this restaurant regularly."}
{"text":"If you want good breakfast and customer service I highly recommend this place.  Bacon is BOMB!!!"}
{"text":"Had a client meeting cancel and decided to go here for breakfast with my business partner. Without question, this place is a gem. I had the breakfast burrito and it was excellent. Arguably the biggest breakfast burrito I have ever had. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"A hole in the wall kind of exterior(and interior) but judging a book by its cover is not what you need to do here. My niece ordered the French toast and I ordered the breakfast quesadillas.....delicious and on point. No exotic flavors or interpretations of classic dishes- just flavorful tasty comfort food. Service was very friendly- nice people here...and the prices are low. My niece wants to come back tomorrow....."}
{"text":"The people are very nice but I always call it like I see it. This place could have gained two more stars if it had some charm. I've seen bus terminals more interesting than this place. The food we had was very good but it was a  bummer that a couple of menu items were not available and we were asked to make second choices.   The menu is as transient as that bus terminal I was talking about. No flow, no direction and  the same discourse continues in the ordering and serving, it felt awkward.  My suggestion to the owner, A cafe should be table service period. Tear down the fast food counter or fill it with a mural and get some swinging doors back to the kitchen. Build a bussing station and put a POS near the entrance door and you let people sit where they want.   With all the avid energy you guys put into the partial self service concept you have now, you will make better tips bringing water, coffee and tea refills. Take orders and serve the food on real dishes and not a mix mash of styro and dinner plates.   Buy 5 or 6 old camo nets from a army navy store and cover that awning out front, sweep it out and dress it up for some tables. Just driving by I would be curious to eat under camo nets more than the remnants of a dust storm. Wait, that's the answer! Call yourself haboobs and dress it up like an Apocalyptic Breakfast Zone. Wait! That's the new name of your restaurant! The ABZ"}
{"text":"South mountain cafe locally owned and operated. We had the chilaquiles and they are bomb! The Candied pancake hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Horchata is soooo good and on point.  Hidden gem.  Food was fresh, flavorful, and delightful.  Filling, good size portions, fast.  We will definitively be return customers."}
{"text":"Our first time here and after eating breakfast, I know this will soon be our go to place! We can't wait to come back and try the many different options for breakfast, lunch and dinner. There's nothing like this place even close to this area. I love that it's a local family running this restaurant and you can tell by the attention and love put into the menu and preparation of food. Please take the time to look past the exterior of the building and realize just what a gem this place is! The owner is just 20 years old and running it with his dad. I give him a lot of credit for being creative and motivated. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Unassuming restaurant. Best salsa ever in Arizona. I have been on a quest for a great red salsa. They have it here. Tastes great and has a kick at the end. The staff is great! Order at the counter and they bring your food to you. We were the only ones in the restaurant since it was early. We asked questions and they answered all of the questions.   We ordered the South Mountain and the Candied Pecan Pancakes. This was enough for the two of us to share. The eggs I ordered scrambled, perfectly cooked. Not dry and quite tasty. Bacon was thick and cooked to perfection. The potatoes which dh could not get enough were cooked crispy on the outside and nice and moist on the inside. The spices used on the potatoes were delicious. My breakfast also came with watermelon. Sweet and wonderful in the summer time.   We asked for red chile and salsa. The red chile tasted better as it warmed. They only use it as a marinade to cook a meat, but being from New Mexico we had other plans. I want to try it again on the meat next time. Back to breakfast. We added salsa to the eggs and it was great. We finally had a great place that made salsa not too hot but with a kick at the end. PERFECT!   The biscuits were perfect! Was this a southern restaurant? WOW! The sausage gravy was just like my grandma could make. I never would have expected biscuits and gravy to taste this good in ARIZONA!   Pancakes. Moist, sweet, to use this word again PERFECT! Dh did not want to share like I had shared my breakfast with him, but eventually he shared with me. I am picky about candied pecans and the pecans were scrumptious. All the flavors together mixed well and were a real treat. Not much syrup needed.  This place is quite deceptive. We were not sure it was open or not and dh did not want to eat there based on the outside. I saw the reviews and knew it had to be good. So I dragged him along. I told him since we got up so early to drop off at the airport I deserved to try this place. He was more glad than I was when he was finished. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Came in for breakfast since there are really no options in the area.   Food was fresh and very good!    Outside is a work in progress, food inside more than makes up for outside.    We will be back another day to give lunch/dinner a try for sure!"}
{"text":"Great new breakfast and lunch spot in South Phoenix. This area is sorely lacking in locally owned restaurants with good food and service, and they have both. I'm thrilled to see this place show up and I will be going back soon."}
{"text":"The food is so good. Everything has so much flavor, the best part is it's not expensive. The staff here at South Mountain Cafe are extremely nice and courteous!"}
{"text":"Food and customer service is excellent! The gravy fires are a must! The area may be a little sketchy but don't let that detour you from this gem."}
{"text":"We had breakfast here and it was delish! Food came out looking great and tastes wonderful! Don't let the outside fool you...give this place a try. Food is totally unexpectedly good!"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in the valley to eat at! I noticed this place the other day and tried it out! I was amazed of the quality of food they served me and my family! The price is unbelievable for the amount of food you get! You get a lot for your money and it's good enuf to eat everything! I would highly recommend this place for large families on a budget!"}
{"text":"New local/family owned quick service restaurant. Serving breakfast and lunch, but a dinner menu is on the way. Had a tasty steak burrito and wife  had chicken taco combo. Food was tasty and  good value for the portions. Super clean dining room and restrooms. Very friendly service. South Mountain area is sorely lacking independent restaurants, so give this place a try."}
{"text":"What's Great: Service (Fast Casual) Food Philosophy/Approach Cleanliness  What's not Great: Parking Lot (who care's?) Building Exterior (you can't see it while eating delicious food)  We used to be in the business,... and when we realized we were one of about a zillion choices  for consumers,.. we had to narrow down just exactly what we were going to be not good at,.. but great at???  We decided it would be:  Excellent Product and the Golden Rule; treat (service) others as you expect to be treated. Teaching our employees a simple motto; \"We are not screwing around here\"   It is so refreshing to find an eatery with the same values!   Stopped into SMC this morning for breakfast, three orders ,.. cooked to perfection. I won't bore you with what we had, because it was all outstanding! My advice is scan the menu, order what you like,.. I think there is little chance you will not be delighted.  Chef Z. has it going on."}
{"text":"This place is incredibly priced and the food was delicious!! You get a very large portion to the point you probably can't finish it all!  If you haven't tried before I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Don't judge a book by its cover , it is said. In this case, don't judge a place by its exterior or its surroundings. There is a small gem living inside and that gem is this. The owner is very young and owns South Mountain Cafe with his dad. The family puts pride into their service and the food, which is simple but good, comfort food. Yesterday, we decided to give South Mountain Cafe a try. I'm so glad that we did. They were serving breakfast and it was almost 1100am. In fact, on the weekends, breakfast is served until 300pm! Score! I love a late breakfast/brunch on the weekend! I had Huevos Rancheros, I just knew they would be authentic and low and behold , they were. The tortillas are hand made and fresh, as are the beans. The ranchero sauce was tasty too and not too spicy. My husband had the South Mountain Breakfast. A pretty standard two egg and bacon breakfast except the sausage gravy was like no other he or I had ever had, ( there are many good versions and my husband would know , he's from Charlotte, NC, after all!) . This gravy had lots of sausage but also sweet onions and sautéed green peppers and were under the home fried chunky potatoes. Yum. He only wished they had given him more! The bacon was very thick slabs and cooked just crispy and right. The coffee was hot and you serve your self ; the initial ordering is counter service and they will bring you your meal and check on you thereafter. I was impressed at how friendly and eager to please the owner and his family were! The place is clean and basic. Again, this isn't fancy in decor, it's super basic. You will drive in and question where you are as you nearly bottom out your vehicle in the heavily pot hole filled parking lot! Trust me, this place is s gem... good food, great service, family owned and local! They have great looking meals for lunch and dinner too.. where in South PHX can you find a Croque Monseuir , for example?! Here!"}
{"text":"Our first visit today. The breakfast food was good, but we suggested that they not go so heavy on the breakfast potato seasonings. They were a little stingy with the pancake syrup and jam. And the coffee creamer should remain chilled or refrigerated. Also, they need new signage with BOLD lettering. The current sign is easy to miss.  Because they are so new, they still need to visit each table to collect feedback. We felt a little ignored after we ordered, but we'll be back to try something new. Generously giving them 4 stars today for their breakfast food. So many South Phoenix restaurants have failed shortly after opening because they refused to collect and follow through with customer suggestions. Hopefully, this place doesn't make the same mistake. Good luck to them because we certainly do need more quality breakfast/lunch/dinner options here in the 'hood. Pricing is reasonable for what you get."}
{"text":"Amazing new breakfast and lunch restaurant in South Phoenix. Support a locally owned place with great food and service."}
{"text":"This is a good place but you have to remember, it's still in the beginning. The food, solid. The service is quality too but they still have some kinks to work out. Good people who obviously care that you enjoy yourself and your food. Be prepared to wait a bit for a  drink and your food, but still, good food.  I recommend anyone give it a shot and I really am hoping for big things from this place."}
{"text":"I was curious about the new South Mountain Cafe heard a lot of people saying it was really good on Yelp stopped in there and it was really good. Jose one of the owners along with his family were really personable family and hard workers. needs some good reviews and also needs good advertising if anybody knows of any good free advertising for this local business it would be great the food was great and the place was great too. They work very hard to get it where it is. just need more people!"}
{"text":"Very tasty food!! My husband and I were trying to find a good breakfast spot in our area and we are very happy we came across this place! Fresh squeezed orange juice from actual oranges not just a labeled box, great seasoned potatoes and fluffy pancakes, south mountain cafe serves up great tasting food! We will definitely be back. Anyone looking for a better alternative to Denny's or IHOP, then this place is a must."}
{"text":"Stopped in for late brunch. We had the breakfast burrito and red posole. Both delicious and came out fresh to order. Would definitely go back. Prices were great and we actually think the location is perfect."}
{"text":"OMG! What a fantastic breakfast! This is my second time here, the serving size is nice, the gravy is delish, and the potatoes are just down right sinful! Next time I hear biscuits and gravy calling me!"}
{"text":"I went there this morning on a whim, the food was very good. The portions are big, and the food was very flavorful. The staff was very friendly, I spoke with Joe. The owners are local, they know the area and the history of the location really well. I will definitely be returning to try other items off of the menu."}
{"text":"Very good biscuits and gravy and the rest of the menu sounds delicious!  Very friendly and knowledgeable on how to grow a business. I was getting the vehicle worked on across the street talked to the cook who was outside and decided to give it a try it is quality food not just quantity. Yes the area doesn't look so appealing but if they keep there focus on taste and presentation they'll go far."}
{"text":"Believe the reviews that say don't judge a book by its cover.  We've balked at this cafe for months now until a quick search of restaurants reminded us of the 5 star reviews.  From the outside this place looks unassuming, one might even say uninviting. Don't  be fooled as we were.  The inside is clean and comfy, the staff friendly and food definitely flavorful.  A good bacon and egg breakfast and some perfectly seasoned potatoes without the hassle of a 45 minute wait to be seated like you usually find on a Sunday.    My partner had the croque monsieur which passed my Parisian taste test! Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I was admittedly underwhelmed by the curb appeal of this place originally. However, I'm so glad that I overcame my hesitation because I am so pleased with this restaurant! My husband and I have been twice now to make sure it wasn't a fluke, and we will absolutely be back many more times. The menu has all kinds of different things to offer for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Our food both times has been really excellent.   Most importantly I wanted to say that this cafe seems to be owned and operated by a really lovely family. The first time we came in, it was pretty dead but the man working took the time to come over and chat with us about where we live, what restaurants we like in the area and how we heard about South Mountain Cafe. The personal attention was so nice and it was really lovely to know that they live locally. This community is a better place with them here!   You can expect a hybrid order at the counter/table service experience with no frills here. I'm excited to see how this cafe grows and changes (and hopefully thrives) as time goes on!"}
{"text":"Friendly Service, Good Food, Family Owned and Operated   I got a Groupon and thought we would make the journey to check this place out. We were greeted warmly by members of the owner's family. The son who is super attentive and genuinely welcoming helped us select the proper menu items to satisfy our hunger.  I had the chorizo beef breakfast and it was a tasty treat that left me nice and full and ready for a nap!  The coffee is self-serve and taste good, but maybe drinking several cups of it might've been a bit much for my stomach mixed with the char easel. LOL. That's totally my fault though for thinking that coffee is water and downing it when I'm thirsty.  When you're pulling up you could almost not even notice this place. As the exterior isn't anywhere near as inviting as the interior.  Stop by and give them a chance and your stomach will be glad you did."}
{"text":"I went here after a training in the area. I would have never chosen it based on the outside, but yelp suggested it. It looks like Lalo Cota worked on the exterior there. I actually drove past it twice (mainly because of some road work). I had the chilequiles and they were delicious! The beans and rice were well seasoned, the tortillas were nice and crispy. I'm looking forward to trying more things on their menu. The service was great. I was the only customer there at 12:30pm on a Saturday..."}
{"text":"This place is super delicious! It doesn't look like much from the outside, but the food is fabulous. I had the fish tacos, my boyfriend had the steak burrito, and we shared the blonde poutine. Later we tried the civic he with friends. It is really unique and flavorful food! There's American and Mexican food."}
{"text":"My friends and I went to this cafe yesterday and found it amazing.. I had the blackened fish tacos made with tilapia...a bit of spice but very flavorful. My two friends had the Steak Quesadilla which was very flavorful as well.  The inside of the cafe was clean and the kitchen very orderly.. I had a chance to chat with Chef Jose and a very nice person.. His son Jose was an awesome host for the cafe. This place is a gem and would recommend it to anyone who want's something out of the norm.. Great Latin American Food...I'd give it 10.stars if I could.."}
{"text":"Let me say that I am an individual that will support local business any time I can. We were in a larger group and more than a few of us were disappointed with the food and portion size for the price. I ordered the American Breakfast and was taken back by the small pancakes that were still batter-tasting. They were too dense and undercooked. I did not eat them all. The eggs over-easy were good but the \"green pepper\" part of he meal was two thin slices. The \"thick bacon\" was falsely advertised. The bacon was the skimpiest bacon I've ever been served, anywhere. To be honest, I only ate the food because I was hungry. The highlight of my meal were the crispy French fries and ketchup I sampled (that someone else ordered). As a local business, I'll give it one more try. This review was being given one star and I only bumped it up to two stars since the owner came out and offered an explanation for the food and service- indicating the cook was a no-show and was operating with the help of his sons."}
{"text":"Went by tonight and they are closed. Shame, I was looking forward to it. Sign said they were turning into a mariscos joint....just what we need in central!"}
{"text":"This has probably been the best restaurant experience that me and my boyfriend have ever had. Not only was the food awesome, but the staff was just as great. The food was just like a home cooked meal except I didn't have to cook. The staff made us feel like family. We will definitely be back to try lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"We have been fortunate to find and love some of the best Chefs in the Valley and the creations that they offer. The common thread with all of their restaurants are that they are locally owned and sourced with local food. Peg and I have heard about South Mountain and Chef Jose Zacarias Sr.  and were determined to check it out. We ate breakfast this morning (served by Jose Jr,) and just smiled. Locally produced good, simple, honest food. Basic and beautiful. The standard stars of eggs (perfectly scrambled and over easy), crisp bacon, simply prepared roasted potato chunks and peppers and light fluffy pancakes (though I only had about three bites...didn't want to overdo....surprisingly....).  In the middle of a neighborhood that has an overload of chain restaurants...I strongly encourage you to support this family. Case in point, as we were entering the restaurant, the Chef was scrubbing down the threshold to the front door, then stopped and helped Peg step up the steep curb while I was getting the door,..and then he went to the kitchen. All Chefs that we know wear many hats...and this one was no exception.  Dr. B"}
{"text":"Sometimes, the best food is served up in places that don't look like they serve up the best food -- and this is one of those places.    To be brief, the specific location and building exterior might make you think twice about venturing inside, but please don't let it deter you.    We decided to check this place out late on a Sunday morning after seeing it was \"hot & new\" on Yelp, and I'm so glad we did!   It wasn't busy that morning, but when the rest of Phoenix finds out about this place, I have no doubt it will be!   It's an order at the counter then have your food brought to your table type of place.  I ordered the South Mountain Breakfast - Eggs, exceptional thick cut bacon, home fried potatoes with a sausage gravy that's whipped up with onions and peppers and a whole lot of deliciousness.  Their twist is definitely in that gravy and I liked it, a lot.   They substituted my toast for a biscuit at no extra charge as well -- I mean if there's sausage gravy on the plate, I gotta get some biscuit to soak it up!    This is clearly a family owned and operated place, and the staff was very courteous and helpful.  We had great and attentive table service after our orders were delivered, and were offered to-go cups for our drinks once we were done.  I had a hard time deciding what to order, which of course means I will be back to try other things on the menu.     Great spot for a weekend meal, for sure.  Delicious food at a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"Hidden gem! Excellent food, friendly service. I've tried multiple menu items, haven't been disappointed. You won't be either."}
{"text":"Excellent experience! My father and I were on our way to hike South Mountain and stopped in for breakfast. It is obvious that the owners and staff take pride in what they have created. The food was great. Big portions and excellent quality for low prices. The entire place, including the bathroom was spotless and clean. The staff was friendly and even had great hiking recommendations!  Best part was the child-drawn pictures of food and family on the wall. I am proud to support a local, family-owned business and I highly recommend you do as well!"}
{"text":"This is a lovely restaurant with excellent options! It is right next to my work and I frequently walk over; I always get great food and nice service. Thank you so much for sponsoring our Teacher Appreciation Week!"}
{"text":"LOVE the fries! They always give great portions of food, and the fries are some of the best I've had in South Phoenix. The rice and beans are great also. Thanks again for sponsoring lunch for the teachers at PCA, we appreciate you!"}
{"text":"Do not be deterred by the outside of the building. This place is awesome!  Great service! American breakfast was delicious- potatoes mildly spicy. Kids loved pancakes and French toast. Huevos rancheros were excellent as well. Definitely recommend for breakfast- have not tried any of their lunch/dinner food. Casual ambiance, good for kids."}
{"text":"Been twice, and the food/service could use some love.  Last time I arrived 20 minutes before they closed and they were out of almost everything.  Totally understand if you are a mom/pop shop with limited supplies, but it's never good to have to turn away customers before your close time."}
{"text":"The food at South Mountain Cafe is amazing ! I'm absolutely addicted to the tilapia ! You've got go give them a try !"}
{"text":"Nice to have options in this area.. I ordered the French toast, one slice was too burnt to eat.  Also would have preferred strawberries on top, not apples.  Our table was wobbly and there was a puddle of water at our feet.  Next time I'll take it to go and hope for better."}
{"text":"Great little place. A true cafe diner experience in south Phoenix. Great customer service. Sparse decor but they are just starting out. I'm glad the food was fresh and made to order. I had the biscuits and gravy with Sunnyside up eggs. Everything was done perfect. I'll be back to try dinner."}
{"text":"Never judge a book by its cover.  This saying totally goes with this restaurant.  Before our drive home, we needed breakfast and came across this place based on the high Yelp reviews.  But when we pulled up, I became VERY weary.  It was an old dilapidated fast food restaurant, that looked almost abandoned.  I almost thought it wasn't open for business.  We went in anyway and I'm glad we did. The menu consists of American and Mexican dishes and a fusion of both.  The servings are totally worth your money.  Best of all, the food was delicious.  Both my kids enjoyed their breakfast meals.  It was like eating something cooked in a fancy restaurant, cause the quality was excellent.  Friendly service from the crew who I assume are all family members, so that was a plus.  As we finished up, the restaurant started to fill up.     Definitely a place worth trying out, just don't let the outside deter you.  You'll miss out on something great."}
{"text":"I went for dinner last night and everything was amazing. Fish tacos were fresh and the fish was grilled instead of friend and greasy. My husband said his steak burrito was very good and my son loved his steak quesadilla. The french fries were super crispy and we ate them all. Because it was the grand opening, they gave us free corn to try. We loved it. I will be back for dinner again.  We returned today to try out the breakfast. My son loved his egg sandwhich. I ordered the American Breakfast. The pancakes were light and fluffy and the eggs were perfect. I was not a fan of the potatoes but I brought them home and my husband thought they were great."}
{"text":"So delicious! Seems sketchy at first but it really is amazing food! Mom had breakfast and I had their jalapeño ham and cheese.... huge portions and really well put together. Will make this a regular thing"}
{"text":"My first time experience wasn't so pleasant here. The food was cold. It didn't have a good presentation and it all just didnt have any flavor. After putting everything aside i finally decided to give this place a second try. Maybe try their lunch and dinner menu perhaps it would be better than their breakfast. According to the yelp app, the restaurant closes at 9pm. As we arrive at the restaurant a young man tells me that they are actually closed. Which is something that really irritates me because if that's the case i suppose that they could change their online schedule. I dont think ill be back. Was disappointed twice not gonna be disappointed a third time"}
{"text":"Great food, different and delicious menu. Family owned by local south Phoenix family. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The food & service was amazing ! I had the French Toast. All 3 slices cooked to perfection, very fluffy and the candied apples on top complimented the French toast so well. My boyfriend had the American Breakfast, he never  gets full when we go out to eat breakfast, but this time was different. He couldn't finish his food. I had never seen so much food for such a low price !"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and the food is great. And the people are even better. It's as if they welcomed you into their home. Such great service and conversation."}
{"text":"It's great to have another breakfast option in the south mountain area . I had the American breakfast and man then Pancakes where great , fluffy and tasty , great bacon as well . Over all everything was good and I would come back again. I also had some tasty horchata"}
{"text":"I had the Biscuits and gravy and it was delicious. Up and coming little place. Family owned! On the south side. Would give it a try! Laid back setting and great customer service."}
{"text":"As soon as the door opened I was immediately greeted with a welcome and how is my day. Before I even had a chance to say what do you guys have the menu was already placed in front of me the gentleman who took my order explained that breakfast is all day and everything is delicious. My dad had been in here with my brother they had ordered the fish tacos previous. I ordered the fish tacos and they were amazing really really good. On the outside it can look a little rough but it's still brand new however don't let that fool you they are very busy if you use the eat 24 app they are mad crazy when it comes to deliveries this place is a nice oasis in the food desert here in south Phoenix whereas you're only options are Guadalajara and Panchos unless you really crazy fast food all the time which I do not. Everything here is homemade they make it from scratch it take the time to make it but they do give you exceptional customer service again don't let the outside full you if you're driving by get in the parking lot get out of your car and try them they are amazing"}
{"text":"Don't let the exterior or interior fool you, this is one of the best breakfast burrito places in the area.   I almost drove right by it (twice) but thankfully Waze politely corrected me (twice).  Simple, delicious, filling, and they don't skimp on the good stuff or try to fill their breakfast burritos with just a bunch of potatoes. A+."}
{"text":"Good morning neighbors. We checked out South Mountain Cafe this morning. This place is destined to be a little gem in our community. SMC is family owned by a dad and son team, Jose and Jose Jr. Dad is the chef in the back with decades of experience which shows in the food. Jose Jr. Is managing and making sure everything is satisfactory.   Like many of my favorite places in South Phoenix, the exterior is a little unpolished, but once inside you will find an immaculately clean restaurant. I have to say it's one of the cleanest I've seen. Probably Dad's years in the business shining thorough.   Now, let's talk food. I ordered the South Mountain Breakfast. Only order this if you have a big appetite or someone to share. All of the servings we received were large portions for a good price. But they haven't skimped on quality. The gravy on my order and the pancake in my son's order were either home made or quality mix. They didn't have the after taste that less quality mixes have.   The pancake..big fluffy, covered in candied pecans and whipped cream. We also ordered the cheese crisp breakfast. Which was a cheese crisp, covered in pico de gallo and an egg. The SM breakfast came with potatoes. Normally, I ignore potatoes, they are just bland. Not these, they are cooked with purple onion, red and green bell pepper, giving them a very home made taste and lots of flavor.   Jose said that their goal is quality food at a reasonable price. I think they are well on their way to that goal.    They have officially been open two days, so forgive any operational opening glitches. They are very customer service oriented and attentive."}
{"text":"I am so grateful that friends more adventurous than I suggested I come here. Quite honestly the exterior appearance is such that I would likely drive by without a second thought. That would be a mistake - the food is outstanding, the staff charming and it's all reasonably priced. There's something about the warmth of the family ownership that just makes me want them to succeed. To this end I bring everyone I can in for breakfast or lunch - and all of my guests are more than happy, delighted even, and state that they are going to return again."}
