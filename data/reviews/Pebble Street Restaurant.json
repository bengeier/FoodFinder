{"text":"Food is not bad. It's ok if you do not expect any service at all. They'll just drop the food on the table without telling you what it is. None of the waitresses will bother to even ask who ordered what dishes, so pay attention or you'll be eating someone else's food."}
{"text":"Food is very good, price is reasonable. Service is meh...  If you go during rush hour, the wait for a table is brutal... But if you want Chinese food this is the only place in the NE/SE that's Good!"}
{"text":"Not bad . Not great  Food quality is decent . Menu has great dishes . Execution sucks . Service is nowhere to be found.   Too bad the place could be very good with some passion and or management"}
{"text":"I had the lucky opportunity to visit last week with 4 other friends. The service was quick and I found the servings were smaller, however it was worth the price.  Great variety of food to choose from and very flavourful as well. I found the cheesy baked mussels were amazing and the deep-fried milk custards were crispy and delicious. The shark fin soup was also okay, the best part was probably the sesame oil which gave it a very rich texture and amazing aroma~  Their specialty drinks are not too bad, however I found the taro powdered bubble tea too watery and the bubbles were overly soft and squishy. Yet, throughout our meal, the dining room was about half full. In addition, its sister restaurant which shares the same managment, work staff, and kitchen had a couple of customers. However, there were only a few patrons and many were there for the special hot pot deal.  I found the washrooms to be rather unkempt and there was only one stall for each gender, this seems to rather hazardous for peak hours...  Overall, I found the presentation of food and the flavour to be amazing. However, the quality of drinks and the lack of attention for the washrooms lowers its rating."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever. Not only there is a communication gap, but the customer service is non existent."}
{"text":"Great place for snacks, congee, fried rice, noodles, fried noodle. Alway consistent with quality.."}
{"text":"This is a cheap and quick place to eat lunch or dinner, if your not fussed about good service and decent food, then this is the place to go. I had their pork belly on rice and it was good. Sorry i was starving so no photos."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if I'm supposed to rate on my visit today or in general.  I came today expecting what I have not only seen at many other Chinese restaurants but actually,  this very one as this is not my first visit.  My rating is based on the average of all my visits (1 star for every visit before,  5 stars for today = 3 stars at the moment)  In my years in Calgary I've been here many times and the experience was horrendous service, great food.  Today, to my surprise, the food was great AND the service was okay.  While most people say \"okay\" is nothing to be proud of, in a Chinese restaurant,  that translates to amazing!  The waitress checked on us twice!  And we didnt even waive her down!  People!  That's progress!  On to the food.  The menus are pretty large with selections for everyone.  I favor the Hong Kong style foods as it is a little more unique than the typical Chinese food that tends to get ordered by the non exposed customers.   Make sure you order a lot of hot sauce, they get chincey with it.    Baked mussels, duck soup, and pan fried hk noodles left me and my beautiful date happier than Buddha's belly.  Now the hard part ... leaving the T&T parking lot without hitting a random idiotic pedestrian.  FYI: The parking lot literally has people trying to jump in front of your car to make a fast buck.  Tread carefully."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch whenever I make a trip to TNT supermarket for groceries! Their menu has several items from different cuisines-regional chinese, japanese, and even portuguese dishes.If you come at a specific time-they'll have dim sum items available. The prices are also pretty fair.  Their dining room, which shares the same kitchen as the dimsum place next door, can seem a bit awkward as you sometimes end up sitting in the larger tables in the middle of the room, which is ok because in more than one occasion have I enjoyed dinner and random conversation with strangers."}
{"text":"My go to place for quick bite to eat at a Chinese restaurant. The bonus is its in the pacific mall which has a TNT grocery store. Have lunch and get some shopping done.  There's tones of parking stalls BUT it'll take you 15+ minutes to find parking all the time. The restaurant atmosphere is not meant for quiet dining but the food is really good and probable one of the top ten best Chinese places to eat in Calgary. There's a wide selection of noodles, rices and side dishes to please any palette. The price is good not overly expensive for Chinese \"fast food\".  However there service is lacking but Chinese restaurants are not known for good services! There's only two washroom (F/M) on the pebble street restaurant side and it's not very clean .... It's better to use the food court washroom if needed."}
{"text":"Ohhh pebble street. This is a hit and miss restaurant.  The servers... Are good 1/10. They're mostly rude, they never smile, they're very loud when it comes to cleaning tables. It feels like they're using their silverware to drum their plates. Sometimes I think they do it on purpose to make your ears shatter and bleed.  I said 1/10 times they're good right? There was this one time that their chicken wings were raw blood and everything, and the server gave us dessert for it. He was a cool server. But that was like 7 years ago.  Not kidding, I go to this place only because their food is good most of the time. But when it's a miss, it's a terrible miss. Their drinks are just nasty. Those iced teas? Gross.  I asked the waitress (from several different occassions FYI from different waitresses) to give me soup the same time the main dish comes out (combo meal). Because often, by the time they give me my main meal, the soup is cold and I like hot soup with my rice.  And the waitress smirked, and said that she can't do that. She can't or won't? I don't know. And another waitress, smirked as well, and just plain said no. And then another (note several times) said that they aren't allowed to do it like that. Rinse and repeat. Maybe the establishment just really won't give you your soup served the same time as your meal? I don't know?  Why is it that so hard?  Anyways, you get the point, service is horrible, they don't ever smile. They're rude.  Well now, the food is good. My favourite is the portugese baked rice or the chicken and cream with Rice. It comes with their tea drink, or coffee. I always say no to either cuz their drinks there are nasty, and I am not a picky person either! Their ramen is nice, and their soups and noodles are good as well.  Their appetizers are over priced, I think. The last time I bought their chicken wings was when I got it raw, it wasn't a good deal.  Recently, I find that their servings are smaller than they used to be, and more expensive.  The place itself is nice to look at at first but when you are about to sit down you see butt prints on the seats and how cracked the pleather is. The tables move and jiggle a bit here and there but that was only 1 table in a span of 10 years.  To be honest, I don't know why I keep going back. Maybe because my parents always go there and they're used to crappy service but good food. Or probably because it's convenient and it's there.  I give it a 2/5, almost passing because of old furniture, extremely crappy, unfriendly staff, and increased prices/decreased portions."}
{"text":"ALLERGY ALERT! The chili oil sauce that is on the tables contains mini dried shrimp. I wondered what gave it the extra flavour and suspected it was dried shrimp and I was right. I found several in a large tablespoon of the stuff at the bottom of the chili jar, there is no indication anywhere that the sauce might contain shellfish. This is a typical Hong Kong type of cafe restaurant and they expect that most of their customers will read and speak Chinese and if you don't it will be a less than satisfactory experience especially where service is concerned. It's good cheap eats, I had a huge portion of shrimp dumplings with tossed noodles.  I don't want to sound prejudiced but it's a typical fast Chinese food restaurant, the menu is horrendously hard to read, they skip the numbers of items on their list if they have a picture of it. Most of the lunch dishes are under $10 with some around $11-12. Some specials allow you to add a specialty beverage for $1. It features HK style cafe dishes that are a fusion of Southeast Asian, Italian, and whatever they think works. If you enter Pebble Street from the parking lot entrance you will eventually realize that Pebble Street and Forbidden City are run by the same company, there is the cashier counter to your left and past that allows you entrance into Forbidden City restaurant and to your right is the cafe.  Hot tea is served in a plastic tumbler right after you are seated. I would grab a printed take-out Pebble street menu though the prices are outdated (available at the cashier counter as you enter). It is much easier to read though there are no pictures it is definitely less confusing. The level of English spoken is from poor to not so poor so don't expect to discuss more than what may be in a dish and even then I'm not sure that if you have allergies that it would be safe, so for those of you who are gluten intolerant or have other allergies I would eat at your own risk. It's decent Chinese fast-food and most dishes are just under $10."}
{"text":"One of few HK style cafes I enjoy in Calgary.   Large menu and lots of booths.   This restaurant is attracted to Forbidden City but you are only able to get a limited amount of items and vice versa.   Staff is very and quick to clear your tables when you have appetizers.   My go to here is the baked Portuguese chicken rice and wonton soup.   Portions are decent and pricing is right on for what you get.   It can get busy during lunch rushes especially on weekends.   Overall have to try this place for authentic HK cafe food."}
{"text":"We were Calgary on this weekend for dog sitting. On Saturday, We had early snack dinner at the Pacific Place Mall before the grocery. The restaurant named Pebble Street. It located right outside the mall and beside Forbidden City Seafood& Dim Sum Restaurant. There are lots of parking spaces for people to park their cars. People can go shopping at the mall, and then find a restaurant to eat. The location is such convenience for people.  We arrived the restaurant around 4:15 pm. Even though it's very early before the dinner time, the restaurant was still half full already. I couldn't believe that lots of Chinese people have their dinner this early at the restaurant. We found a table and the waitress brought the menu to our table fast. Then, she began to serve our drinks. The menu was very colorful and each dish has a picture, which made us easier to order the food. There are so many selections on the menu. We couldn't decide which one we should have. After a few minutes discussed, we decided to order Noodles from this restaurant. The prices of the noodle bowls are about $10 or less, which is a very great deal. I had it's Beef Flat Noodle Bowl with hot milk tea. My boyfriend ordered Beijing Duck Rice Noodle with cold milk tea. Our noodles came out fast. The noodles were well cooked. Vegetable in the soup was fresh. The soups were very hot and tasty. I believe both of them used the same chicken soup base. Each bowl had lots of meat. Both noodles bowls were large portion so delicious and tasty. We ate them all. My hot milk tea was OK. It was very simple, which tasted like Milk + Tea. My boyfriend's cold milk tea was very different from mine. It was super delicious and had very strong flavors. The whole meal cost us $19 include the tax. Add the tips, we spent $21. It's such a great experience at Pebble Street. We enjoy our dinner there. Definitely, we should come back to this place again."}
{"text":"Good prices you'd be able to work with. Great tasting daily specials but you can't compare pebble street to the sister restaurant, Calgary court (downtown). The service isn't great here. Seems like a lot of sass coming from the waitresses and the worst attitude when taking your payment. Whether your left your tip on the table or tipping with change instead of on the machine, not to worry, they'll remind you!"}
{"text":"Is there a zero review option? I just walked out of this place, it is currently 7:45pm. We walked in at 6pm and ordered our food. Two other tables came in afterwards that got their food and drinks. We didn't even get our drinks. The manager didn't bat an eyelash when I tried to flag her down. I'm famished and now sitting at McDonald's."}
{"text":"Went here for a lunch, seated myself and a waitress came to take my order 10minutes after. Then I waited another40 minutes for the meal to come, all i ordered is a curry pork rice. What kind of restaurant take 40minutes to cook this? Its not even rush hour. They were not busy at all! Not even a drink on my table. Never coming back"}
{"text":"After a night of volleyball on Monday, we've decided to grab a quick bite at a nearby Chinese restaurant and found this Hong Kong Style Café.  Atmosphere - Typical of a Hong Kong style café. The place was clean in sitting areas but I wouldn't recommend snooping around or paying too much attention to the finer details. Service was okay.  Food - Better than expected. The food was flavorful but a bit unbalanced. The cream sauce on our noodle dish was a little heavy and the curry on rice was spicier than expected. As with most Chinese restaurants, the food was also a bit greasy, but that was exactly what we were craving for after a night of volleyball.  Value - Decent. Portion size reflected the asking price. They also did not skimp out on the protein unlike some other Chinese restaurants I've been to.  Overall - Good place if you are craving greasy Chinese food after a night of shenanigans and you don't care much for the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I love 95% of the food I order from here. I have been coming here for the last 10 years and I try to try something new everything so it's safe to say I've tried over 60% of their menu as some items I'm constantly just addicted to so I always reorder like their olive pork fried rice, Malaysian curry, dim sum, nanjing beef noodle soup, peanut noodle soup and so much more but these are probably my top favourites. Don't expect the customer service to be super friendly here though but you can expect your food to come out fast and delicious"}
