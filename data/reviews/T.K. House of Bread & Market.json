{"text":"Great breads but the cream puffs and eclairs are to die for and OMG you gotta try the bachlava - did I spell it right?"}
{"text":"Great service 5 quality! The delivery service is awesome and the packaging is nice and most especially the food is pretty and delicious. Thank you for caring for your costumers."}
{"text":"Last night we had the best dinner ever. Everything we ordered was so good and not to forget how affordable it is. Definitely will be coming back soon."}
{"text":"Was at Discount Tire getting a slow leak fixed and was honestly just trying to waste time waiting on my car.  I found one of the best ways to wait on a flat tire.  It's a small bakery/deli/market specializing in Armenian food.  Simple but delicious.  The market is pretty cool with some Southern European specialties.  As we left, the baker gave us some Armenian bread...and that's why I'm writing this review.  It was out of this world.  I consider myself lucky for stumbling into this place.  Now I'm a regular."}
{"text":"Let me tell you what. This is not Ordinary unhealthy or fast food place. This market is Definitely for me, the best in Vegas. I Could come here, everyday, 24/7 if possible, I Highly recommend this place to ANYONE! The food is great, Fresh meat, Fresh Deserts, and fresh Dairy. The Workers there are the Nicest people ever. Costumer service here, is the best  you can get   Anywhere. You can come here either to Shop for Great Armenian/Russian food, or just get a bite to eat! I bet you will wanna come again! :)"}
{"text":"I always try to support small businesses.  I visit Las Vegas on business every few weeks and I had a good meal here in the past.  I ordered take out while visiting with friends and it was a huge disappointment. The spicy cheese burekka was very good. The lamahjoon was excellent.   The pizza was pretty bland and the crust fair at best, but this item was ordered by my friend and I did not expect this restaurant to excel in a cuisine that is not within their area of expertise. Unfortunately, we ordered piroshikis in a variety of flavors. They were ALL RANCID, not just light rancid, but very, very rancid.  I suspect the oil they used had been recycled too many times.  It was inedible. I called the restaurant to let them know.  The gentleman on the phone thanked me for the information but did not offer an apology nor suggested a refund or replacement for those items."}
{"text":"This is the best place for kabob! Hands down.  But the adjarski xachapuri is probably the greatest food ever made!!!  And the pizza is so much better than expected...! I love this place!"}
{"text":"Over rated day old bread! Not a good experience but will try again and update my review!"}
{"text":"The food and dessert here is both unique and delicious! I had the chicken lula and chicken kebab with the rice, tabboleh and hummus and tiramisu and a Russian donut with Nutella! Everything was amazing, the flavor phenomenal, the tenderness and moistness of the chicken was unparalleled! Very reasonable prices for amazing food, I highly recommend this place, and they even do deliveries and party trays! Well worth every penny and very nice staff also! I am bringing home some Russian donuts for my girls tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Good food and really nice people. We tried some kind of spinach thing with phyllo dough Which was delicious."}
{"text":"I don't know how to spell what we ordered but everything was so fresh and delicious! Victoria was super sweet and helpful! Highly recommend this spot if you want to try something new and extra tasty!"}
{"text":"We were missing LA so we ordered a few ajarskis to take home and they were SOOOOO GOOOD! Better than in CA"}
{"text":"The worse customer service. When the owner sneezes in his hand and then he continues touching food with his bends with out washing. That's discussing and sick.  Where is the health depart?  When confronted about his actions, the owner didn't even care. He laughs and says who cares. Never going to this sick place with germs."}
{"text":"This place is amazingggg!  The people are so inviting and friendly, their food is fresh and absolutely delicious (some of the best in town), and the atmosphere is familiar!  They have fresh bread made daily along with tasty pastries, their meat and cheese selection is more than decent, their market has almost everything you need, and the welcoming atmosphere makes it worth supporting your local business!!!  Definitely one to check out!"}
{"text":"Me and my family were in Vegas so we decided to have Armenian food so I started searching on Yelp and the first one that pop up was T.K House of bread and market so we decided to give it a try as we were heading home from Vegas. When we got there we were greeted by a very nice man which he was the owner. We ordered the Ajarski all I have to say is you will eat your fingers with it because it was that good. They have all kind of food pizza, BBQ and more and it's also a market so if you want Armenian food that is the place to go because thumbs up it was delicious. And to the gentleman helping us and serving us thank you so much we will see you again very soon."}
{"text":"I love this place! The staff is so friendly, the food is fresh made to order, and everything comes out in a timely manner. The food always tastes great, and o am always a happy customer! My family loves to come and we'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"Very good food people are nice and clean inside.. I always get the beef lula and it's amazing!"}
{"text":"I got the chicken kabob and Lula. Its Delicious! Cook and staff were great, this is must eat here. !"}
{"text":"This review is for 3.5 stars.   Quantity and variety of the entree is very nice. I order delivery and my meal was door to door and fresh in an hour. My chicken and beef kabob came with about 3 large chunks of perfectly grilled, thick meat. The chicken and beef were about the same in terms of taste, both with some Mediterranean spices to give it some flavor. The entree had some runny hummus, tasty tabouleh, a thin, hard pita, and some fine rice. I was disappointed in the pita as I'm typically a fan of the fluffy variety, same with the hummus as I like it chunkier - but I guess this is TK's style. In all the meal was about $13. I also order d a Greek salad for $8 which was humongous and had fresh ingredients, but it seemed lazy (large chunks of tomato, not a lot of feta. But again, this was all delivery so presentation isn't going to match a sit down atmosphere. T.K. in total was good and a nice option to go or delivery, but I wouldn't say it's the one and only stop for good Mediterranean in Vegas."}
{"text":"A wonderful place to eat and to do a grocery shopping! The best Meddle Eastern food provider in the area! If you haven't tried it, make sure to stop by and grub something! Don't miss out, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Its really good !  Seriously delicious  We need more home cooked meals liked  So delicious so yum  Really wow"}
{"text":"There is a pretty neat market inside, I'll have to check it out again but when I went I was looking for bread but there really wasn't any. Kinda weird it's a bread market with no bread.."}
{"text":"great place.i love their bread and pastries. friendly stuff. recommend 100%"}
{"text":"Ordered four combo plates and a Greek salad.  All came with rice, hummus, tabbouleh and nan.  1st combo was chicken Lula and beef kabob, which was ok.  The beef tasted flavorless for a kabob, but the chix Lula made up for the flavor.  2nd combo was beef kabobs, as mentioned flavorless, so big disappointment and no sauce.  3rd and 4th combo was a mixture of chicken/beef kabobs and chicken/beef Lulas, again the kabobs kept coming up short with the flavors.   Greek salad was nicely portioned.   As for the meats I'll come back for the lulas, but not the kabobs.  I guess you can use the hummus for extra flavor since I didn't get any taziki sauce in my combo."}
{"text":"It's a great place to eat. It's also a great place to buy good quality products. Very friendly and polite employees. I am very happy with this place and I'll sure come back there. Great Armenian kitchen. I recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"I don't know the names of anything I bought but everything I tried was wonderful. The small cheese pastry and the thin flatbreadish pizza were flavorful and fresh. I took a raisin bread loaf and pomegranate soda home and both were very tasty too.   All were great and inexpensive. I'll be back to taste all of those beautiful sweets."}
{"text":"Great food. Very authentic. I will definitely be going again. Huge selection of desserts ,an overall excellent choice for Armenian food."}
{"text":"This is mostly a market with a food service counter and a few tables. The food was reasonably priced and very, very good. We enjoyed every dish including the dessert of which they had a good selection.   Service was friendly and the owner and his mother, the cook, greeted us and chatted a bit. We went late shortly before closing and we ordered a lot. I think they were just curious to see who these nuts were.  The market carried a good selection of Eastern European/Middle Eastern goods with a deli counter. Will definitely go back for the food and market."}
{"text":"Used Uber eats and got it delivered in less than 30 mins. Food was perfect and very delicious. I ordered Greek salad and chicken and beef lula and tabuleh. Enjoyed every bite. Well worth the Uber eats. Going to order again. It was healthy choice tonight."}
{"text":"We always order lamajun & Perashki from here and we absolutely love it. The lamajun (meat flatbread) Is very tasty and crispy which I love. The Perashki is great to! Today we ordered the Ajarski Xachapuri (cheese bread with egg)  and I have to say, it was definitely the best Iv had here in Vegas. Overall in my opinion they have great food and a nice market."}
{"text":"So we're driving down the road and we see this sign for the House of Bread... It looks interesting, we go inside and it's a Russian Deli and Market. Behind this counter are these delightful Russian people serving all sorts of Russian fare, which include meat and potato turnovers called Peroshki's, various breads and desserts as well. Freshly made Borscht and luncheon plates. What a great find!"}
{"text":"Great food, great people and Exceptional customer service!!! Defiantly going back to this place. Very warm and welcoming people. Very warm atmosphere. Will recommend to everyone!!!"}
{"text":"Interesting little place.  It is basically a lunch counter in an Armenian grocery store.  Limited menu but good authentic food.  When you order, a woman that could be your grandma shuffles to the kitchen and hand crafts your meal.    Everything is delivered on disposable plates, plastic flatware and styrofoam containers but none of that matters.  The food is delicious and the portion sizes are perfect.  While you eat, the pastries in the cases start calling to you........ they have a wide array of Armenian pastries as well as some of your favorite classics.   We ended up bringing the desserts home because we were too full from dinner.  If you don't mind a Formica table with mismatched chairs in the corner of a grocery store, then you will enjoy this place.  We will go back here when we want a no fuss dinner."}
{"text":"I was told by a fellow yelper that this place has fresh lamajune, so we decided to check it out, They have lots of good looking pastry and lamajune was on the menu up on the wall but when we ordered it they said they were out waste of a trip, maybe if I'm on that side of town again ill stop in and try again."}
{"text":"I ordered a few dishes to be delivered; they were conscientious with my notes about allergies, which is a plus. The dishes that I ordered were:  * Chicken soup. Very tasty, infused with thin-sliced carrots and some other sources of flavors. And a good deal at $6 (it can be a meal in and of itself).  * Beef kabobs. A little tough for my taste, though I did like the flavor. And I liked the bread and hummus that came with the dish.  * Chicken kabob and luna. Better, imo, than the beef kabobs. I'd order it again.  The kabobs and lunas are not cheap, but unlike certain other restaurants of the cuisine, I have confidence that they are using better-quality ingredients, not loaded with salt and other preservatives.  They have a number of other dishes that I would like to try, too, and I look forward to getting more food from them."}
