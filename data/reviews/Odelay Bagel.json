{"text":"Really a great, low key spot. Will be going back for more. Best bagels I have had in Phx."}
{"text":"I'm really loving this place.  It just has a great vibe and the food is simple, unique and delicious.  Bagel and lox is my favorite.  The service is friendly and personable. And the coffee?  I'm an espresso drinker and a double shot in a ceramic cup is always consistent and good.  It's kind of out of the way if you don't live in Ahwatukee but if you're looking for a chill place to spend few quality minutes, this place will deliver."}
{"text":"I would give it 6 stars but they only let you give 5. This place puts einstiens and bagelnosh to shame. On top of that they are playing David Bowie only today in tribute. I spilled my drink and it went all over the table the floor and my sandwich. The staff was super polite about it and not only did they make me a new drink but also a new sandwich!! Great food,coffee and service!!"}
{"text":"So happy that we've found this place! Our family loves it! Good coffee, amazing bagels, and the staff is always so welcoming. Plan to make it a part of our normal routine"}
{"text":"I went into this place on Saturday morning hoping to find a location where I could get a great breakfast sandwich. The actual physical building was a nice-looking place on the inside but the  breakfast bagel that I ate was really, really bad.  I know that some may think I'm picky...I even asked myself that, but this is not about being picky...I don't think anyone would eat this sandwich and say it was even decent.  I'm writing the harsh words in the hopes that they will make a change, because I would like to see them succeed in the breakfast food area."}
{"text":"I was going to give odelay five stars specifically today because of the incident that the user JF has twisted into their own reality. You grabbed my order and didn't pay attention goof ball! The workers  figured out immediately what happened and fixed it insanely fast with great kindness. JF, your order was complicated (I know you left me with your bag) also this was not a twenty minute wait. It's a shame when people feel the need to drag a small business with smart (community) kids working hard to earn money for school. Other than that, their Bagel and cream cheese selection is unique and super yummy! What a great place for the Ahwatukee community to hang out with their families."}
{"text":"This place recently opened up down the street from my house and I'm loving it so far!  The cold brewed coffee and freshly made bagels are amazing. The staff is very friendly and inviting.  The decor inside is awesome and feels comfortable, you could definitely hang out here while enjoying your bagel and coffee.  Side note: I definitely recommend the Asiago bagel with Italian herb and chive cream cheese  and their delicious cold brewed coffee.  Keep up the great work guys!"}
{"text":"Some of the best bagels I have ever had   And the coffee rocks.    Had the lox  I will be back here soon"}
{"text":"This place is extremely cozy and has a great menu. My kids had the chocolate chip bagel and absolutely loved it. I had the feta and Spinach cream cheese and I would highly recommend. Ahwatukee needs more cafes such as this one."}
{"text":"I went to Odelay for the first time yesterday to celebrate a milestone in training with the women's running group I coach. I met Ryan, the owner, and he is energetic and really looking to create a great experience and atmosphere for his customers--and he does it exceedingly well.  He went above and beyond the call of customer service, as any locally owned shop should do. Through the suggestion of several of the runners in my group, Ryan had agreed to put up a sign congratulating one of my runners on her accomplishment (running at least one mile a day for 365 straight days), so that she would be surprised with it when she went to the counter to get coffee upon completion of her run.  As a fellow employee of a small business, I can say with authority that this type of treatment is the defining reason everyone should support local businesses. As a coach and athlete, I appreciate that Ryan leaves a water cooler out very early in the morning for local athletes to rehydrate and cool off.  Runners, cyclists and people out for a walk are sure to tip their respective hats to that thoughtful treatment, especially in our extreme weather months. Oh, and try the black pepper parmesan bagel while you're there."}
{"text":"Great, relaxing, cool place for breakfast or lunch. Fun ambiance , good food and coffee selections. Lunch sandwiches are fresh and tasty. Service is great and the owner is an exceptional businessman with old school service, quality and integrity in mind. I am hard to impress but he has impressed me! I highly recommend the place as a hang out or stop by restaurant. Keep up the good work and thank you."}
{"text":"Crazy. I've lived in this neighborhood for years. Sometimes you miss what's right around you. A bagel finished just before I walked in by a passionate owner. What else can you ask for. Ryan and the folks at Odelay are great. Please support them!"}
{"text":"These are some good ass bagels and schmear! The staff are super friendly too. Down with Einstein, long live Odelay!"}
{"text":"I tried Odelay last week cause it's on my way to work and I wanted to find a great local breakfast spot to pick up every now and then. This is not the place. I had such great hopes for it when I walked in the door. They have a great vibe going on and prices aren't too outrageous but once I got to work and pulled my toasted Asiago bagel with plain cream cheese out I found a half toasted and half blackened rock! The guy completely burnt my bagel and instead of making a new one he just tried to cover it with cream cheese and hide it in the foil. I tried to scrape it off but it was burnt so much the whole thing tasted like licking an ashtray. I can't believe they would serve a bagel like this! It went in the trash along with my hopes for a great new breakfast stop. I will stick with my A.J.'s tea and bagel from now on. It's a little out of my way but it's much better priced and never burnt to ash!"}
{"text":"Great place for bagels. The menu isn't very big yet but it's still good. Clean inside and definitely more unique than most other bagel joints."}
{"text":"Coffee is amazing! Jalapeño cheddar bagel with garlic Sriracha cream cheese is the jam!"}
{"text":"Okay, I'll admit it, I Really like this place.  Ordered two dozen bagels for Thanksgiving and everybody in our family was impressed.  But then I ventured to the most flavorful combination yet.  Jalapeño/cheddar bagel split and toasted with bacon/horseradish cream cheese.  I know what you're thinking, but don't judge till you chew.  The Jalapeño flavor is not in your face, but somehow a smooth deep background flavor in the bagel that is full of flavor with gentle warmth.  That same careful integration of flavor applies to the cream cheese, and together, amazing.  My family went GaGa over the veggie cream cheese on just about everything, and the young kids came to blows over the cinnamon raisin bagels.  Big mistake not to have a couple more of those.  Awesome job.  Genuine, real deal."}
{"text":"Excellent place for coffee and bagels, will definitely go again and Recommend to others. Great customer service!!"}
{"text":"Best bagels. We are from NJ, and lamented bagels since moving here to Scottsdale. No more. This is great. Friendly staff. Good quiet location. Perfect."}
{"text":"Bagels really weren't that good and they are super skimpy on cream cheese. Also went for an egg sandwich but they were out of eggs. Then why have them showing in your display case? Read good things but I was disappointed."}
{"text":"Wanted to go since they opened.  Have known the owner,,Ryan, since he was a kid. Motto tell u, this place has awesome lattes !!!!!  And we split a bagel own face Sammie that was ncredible.   Not the heavy, doughy bagel u get at some places...light and soooo tasty!  My daughter n law and I split this huge, oh so yummy Brie and ham Asiago bagel with sliced apples on top!   Incredible!   I have newel ever been a fan of bagel sandwiches. This blew my mind and changed my mimd.  Go odelay!"}
{"text":"This place rocks! The food is delicious and the lunch sammies are so cool! Went with mom and we had the turkey Swiss and the ham and brie, both awesome!  Mina served us and she was so friendly and efficient! Loved her!"}
{"text":"I like that we have Odelay Bagel as an option in Ahwatukee.   The bagels and cream cheeses have all been good. I've tried several varieties of each and I've never been disappointed. The garlic siracha cream cheese is as good as it sounds.  Their coffee is also great. The only thing keeping this from a five-star review is speed / service for coffee - more than once, I've been completely done with my bagel or breakfast sandwich and I'm still waiting on my latte. It's good when I get it, but slooooooow. Plan accordingly.   The staff is friendly and the ambiance is cozy."}
{"text":"Excellent bagels, great staff. Best bagel spot in the valley, hands down. Jalapeño bagel with horseradish bacon spread is the way to go."}
{"text":"This is a friendly local business with great coffee and bagels!  For lunch I've enjoyed a bagel sandwich with turkey and bacon, and recommend it.  I look forward to going back."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic!  I love the selection of cream cheese smears. The bacon horseradish cream cheese was incredible!  Really great bagels, fantastic coffee and awesome people.  Definitely a must."}
{"text":"I got the egg and cheese sandwich. It was tasty. The iced  Americano was good, but not the best."}
{"text":"Between Odelay and Bagel Man, these are the top locally owned bagel places in the area. Enjoy both of them and usually alternate between them. Each is a notch above the chain places with Bagel Man's offerings bigger than Odelay. While BM offers the standard fare, Odelay serves some innovative items such as parmesan and black pepper. Really hard to choose between the two so I  just go to both."}
{"text":"Super excited to try a new locally owned bagel joint. Arriving at Odelay, it's clear that some thought was put into all the design and esthetics. Outside is a large water cooler that is solely there to fill the large dog water bowl below- as a dog person I think that is super rad, +3 points Odelay.   Entering the business and you see a beautiful rustic wood wall and other great design elements.   As I waited in line, I observed the employee at the counter struggling to get the iPad to accept the credit card payment of the customer ahead of me. For about ten minutes she tried to run the card and it wouldn't take. The customer was clearly getting annoyed (understandably) and I felt bad for the employee, as it's not her fault that the system was buggy.  I was trying to send the employee an ESP message to offer the customer a free coffee or comp one of the bagels- something to make up for the very long delay. But nothing. When the customer finally got her order she was clearly unhappy and left the place quickly. I can guarantee that a free coffee or bagel for her would have made a lifelong customer, but I bet she never returns.   When it's my turn I order a half dozen bagels and a single serve side of butter. I'm charged $10.84. I pay and don't really think about it, but then realize I just paid $3.00 for a tiny side of butter. That is insane, because that's the price of half dozen and a decent side of cream cheese. So a tiny side of butter is the same price as a large cream cheese here somehow?  Getting home- the bagels were better than average, but a bit undercooked. Strangely- there seemed to be a million sesame seeds on each bagel- but none of them wanted to remain on the bagel. Weird.   Overall this place is better than Einsteins, but not as good as Chompie's. I highly suggest some front of house training to learn how to fix little mistakes and ensure you don't lose customers. There is a lack of communication between the cashier and prep staff.  It seemed as though the employee didn't know what to charge for a tiny butter, so I ended up paying the same price as I would have for a decent sized cream cheese.   I wish them all the best, but for me this place is one and done."}
{"text":"I really don't get all the good reviews for this place, It was average at best. I live in Ahwatukee and would rather drive to fountain Hills to DJs bagels for a good bagel."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere at Odelay! Ryan is awesome and super friendly. The Bagel Man was closed today and we wanted a bagel. Happy to have found a new local place to try. Espresso was fantastic and bagels were awesome!"}
{"text":"Great tasting bagels. Nice and clean shop. Very friendly staff. I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Great spot! Fresh made bagels, smears, and hummus every day, and their coffee is on point!"}
{"text":"Really not a fan of this place. The bagels are overpriced and lower quality than you'd get from a grocery store. I've tried a few different options and nothing was good. The salt bagel tasted more like blueberry, the everything bagel might as well be an onion bagel, and the cinnamon raisin bagels are basically a plain bagel with a faint hint of flavor. They're dense and chewy. If these are fresh, they probably need to figure out a better plan because they seem stale compared to a truly fresh bagel.  I wanted to like this place as it's within walking distance of my house but there are quite a few options nearby that are better. They should probably just stick to coffee but that's overpriced and nothing special too."}
{"text":"We were are in Phoenix on vacation and ran across Odelay Bagel from google maps while looking for a place with coffee and bagels. This place had both so we were game to try. Omg. So good! Staff were friendly and very knowledgeable. Our group of 4 had 3 different kinds of bagels (Asiago, errthing, and Honey wheat) with 3 smears (Italian herb and chive, jalapeño, horseradish and bacon), and one of the bagels made into a bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich. Not disappointed. At. All. Intend on running over there again before we fly out at the end of the week. We tried also the iced latte with caramel, cappachino and some sort of Mexican blend coffee, all of which were delicious! Great food, great coffee, great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"If you don't get the black pepper parm bagel with the garlic sriracha cream cheese, you simply don't know what happiness is. Best bagel place I've ever been to! I will drive hours to eat at this place."}
{"text":"Love the idea of supporting small business. Good coffee,  tasty bagels, WiFi, good customer service. Indoor and outdoor seating."}
{"text":"My kind of small hang out.  I stumbled on this place this morning.  The bagels are seasoned on both sides. Love this place"}
{"text":"This is my FAVORITE bagel shop, ever. Ryan the manager is the coolest dude on the planet! Black pepper Parmesan bagel is what dreams are made of. Get you some"}
{"text":"Love this little place! Just voted best bagels of Phoenix in the New Times. Cool coffee shop hipster atmosphere. Really good home made bagels & cream cheeses. I love the horseradish & bacon cream cheese YUM. Don't spend your money at one of those \"evil empire\" coffee shops. Eat local and support Ryan and his awesome staff. Would post a pic but I ate it all already"}
{"text":"I'm an iced toddy junkie and Odelay's does not disappoint. Not skimpy sized either. (Not a fan of green apron chain's burned coffee flavor for comparison). Ryan and co. Are the best. Friendly, will chat with you and the atmosphere is chill. Grab-n-go or hang for 3 hours. The bagels are, hands down, THE BEST in town and being a large dude, the bagel sandwiches can be shared they're so big! I struggle to finish one on my own. It's a coffee/bagel shop, so if you want more, it's not the place for you. Fresh is king at Odelay, you'll enjoy the atmosphere whether w/friends or catching up on work in your laptop (free wifi, but that's common these days). Check 'em out! They are THAT good."}
{"text":"I'm a pretty big stickler for bagels: I like them done a specific way, and I don't accept mediocrity as an excuse in my quest for the perfect bagel. That said, walking into Odelay bagels on a Thursday afternoon, I wasn't holding high expectations. But boy was I wrong: after being greeted by an extremely friendly woman as the sole barista/cashier in the store, I ordered an ice coffee and an onion bagel with cream cheese and lox.   Aside from the inviting atmosphere of the place, I really enjoyed how fresh everything tasted. Even though the coffee was great, the best part was the bagel (as it should be in a bagel store). Slightly crispy on the outside, soft on the inside is the perfect texture for me. Add that with light, clearly fresh plain cream cheese and tasty lox, this was an awesome bagel experience. I've had the supposed \"best\" bagels from NYC, Cleveland and D.C., and this bagel place in the middle of Arizona is up there with them"}
{"text":"Best in the world. Been a lot a lot of places, but by far my favorite.   Will definitely refer friends and family.   Great service and great food."}
{"text":"Had heard this place was good but hadn't had an opportunity to stop by.  Went today and had a bagel and shmear.  It was amazing but not nearly as amazing as the owner and young man who was working there.  They were very friendly and courteous.  I had a taste of their cold brew coffee...it was awesome!  I will go back earlier in the morning and get one soon.  Want to sleep tonight or I would have had one.  Thanks and I will be back soon."}
{"text":"This is a great independent Bagel and Coffee place! I love this place! Bagels made fresh! The Lox and Bagels are the bomb! Owner Ryan is very friendly and personable! Support local Ahwatukee!!"}
{"text":"Great local spot. Freshest bagels I've ever had. Try the Everything Bagel with cream cheese. Mmmm."}
{"text":"It's a quaint local spot that has friendly enough employees but I was under-whelmed by the bagel sandwiches.  The prices are a bit higher than the competition and I have an issue with dirty aprons and counters.  I really feel when I come in and there are 4+ people behind the counter and not many customers they could have had someone cleaning up the restaurant.  I have to agree that the bagels taste like dense circular bread.  The other pet-peeve is the greeter that is wearing an apron that doesn't look like it's been washed in a week. This is not how you want to represent your business.  Sorry, I couldn't give a better review to them..I love supporting local businesses.  Maybe they can clean up their act and I'll give them a 2nd chance."}
{"text":"Went to Odelay Bagel for the first time with a group of friends. Our bagels were amazing! I had a garlic bagel and it was one of the best I've ever had. Coffee is good too. We were all very happy with what we got!"}
{"text":"Authentic water bagels. Perfect density, flavor, and freshness that matches the best west of NYC. Nothing is artificial about these bagels! Talk to the owner and you'll understand what pride is given towards the ingredients, baking process and pure TLC melded into these delights."}
{"text":"Really improved since I went when it first opened. Fresh bagels and excellent ice coffee. Great service! I love the decor. This place is always less busy then Nosh and way better. Try it out.."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is great! We live just down the street but had never made it here. We happened to be up early so stopped in. Their staff is VERY friendly (but not in an annoying way). We ordered bacon, egg, and cheese bagel sandwiches and they were so good! I wish I had ordered a plain bagel too because I could tell from my sandwich that their bagels are awesome and I wish I could have tried just that too. The bagel was slightly fluffy, chewy, and delicious. They were making another batch when we came in so that's pretty cool. Prices were reasonable and I loved the décor and general feel of the place. It feels relaxed and calming. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great place for coffee, ice brewed tea and my favorite the Chi tea.  Menue consisted of bagels with all the fixings. They offer 2 kinds of gluten free muffins that are delish.  Small place with nice vibe. Artwork, pride for a shop small, shop local Ahwatukee business. Bagel breakfast sandwiches made fresh to order.  Please keep in mind it is a bagel shop...so don't expect pancakes and croissants, unless you don't see the sign that reads Bagels. Then feel free to ask for things that do not exist...It always amazes me when that happens and people get upset.  It is like going int In and Out Burgers and asking for the surf and turf. Ahhh people."}
{"text":"Best bagel in the west. Black Pepper Parmesan bagel toasted with Garlic Siracha cream cheese is the best! Great place for entire family.... dogs too!"}
{"text":"Delicious! I have been missing Flagstaff a lot lately (after being up there for almost a decade) and this place hit all the right notes -- and more!   I had a large chai tea, and an asiago bagel with spinach and feta cream cheese. The schmear came with feta cheese sprinkled on top. It was so delicious. Better than what I was craving 160 miles away. My boyfriend ordered his usual: a lox bagel and a coffee. Both of us were beyond delighted and satisfied.   It's small and cute. Comfortable and relaxed.   Can't wait to come again!"}
{"text":"We love Odelay Bagel! The bagels and spreads are delicious, we especially enjoy the Asiago Bagel with cream cheese and lox. The service is always friendly. My young daughters look forward to dropping in. It is always easy to grab something to go as well."}
{"text":"I've never had a bagel with lox, so I finally decided to try it. This was the best bagel I've ever had. I was very impressed not only with the bagel but the aesthetics of the restaurant. Cute, clean, delicious and welcoming."}
{"text":"What a disappointment!! The bagel man was closed so I came here as it was just down the street.  The cashier was HORRIBLE it seemed like I was an inconvenience.  They couldn't print a receipt and their credit card reader didn't work.  The bagels were waaaaaaaay over priced for a bacon egg and cheese bagel.  I almost walked out when I noticed the guy behind the counter making the eggs in the microwave!! My hunger pains and lack of time caused me to stay.   I haven't taken my first bite and I already hate everything about this experience......ugh hopefully their food is not as shitty as their service or I am in for a horrible Monday breakfast.  Update:  As expected the sandwich was HORRIBLE!!! There was enough pepper to kill a small child.  The egg tasted bland and the bagel was nothing to be excited about.  If I could give some negative stars I totally would.  What a waste of $5.14!!!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best bagel places in town. I overheard them say they boil their bagels, (old school!) which would certainly make a favorable difference.   I've only been in a couple times and both times ordered the bagel and lox. The bagel was perfectly chewy and super fresh and they gave a generous amount of salmon with a huge slice of tomato and plenty of cream cheese. (it also comes with onion but I got it without) It was so delicious and actually quite filling.   The girl working the counter, Heaven, was very nice and welcoming - a real pleasure to talk to. Such a nice change from the places where the person behind the counter barely looks at you.  This is the kinda place where it would be easy to become a \"regular.\" A great addition to the Phoenix bagel scene! (If that's a thing - ha!)"}
{"text":"Great bagels, great coffee!  Food: Ryan, the owner, is fanatic about his product! He takes great pride in his coffees and teas, and especially his bagels. And it's justified! The bagels are hand-made on the premises each day. My favorite is the jalapeño cheddar bagel with horseradish bacon smear. Excellent!  Cost: Very reasonable.  Service:  Ryan and his staff are always smiling and friendly. And fast at filling orders.  Atmosphere: Casual. Very casual.   Overall: I agree with other reviewers, this is probably the best bagel shop in Ahwatukee. It's a bit off the beaten path, but head on over, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"One of the best bagel sandwiches I've ever had. You have to try the garlic sriracha  Cream cheese"}
{"text":"Found this place on a Sunday morning. I had a great breakfast bagel sandwich and my wife loved her hot ham and brie open faced sandwich. Also had a good cup of Nicaraguan coffee while listening to live music. A nice Sunday morning. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is a perfect small business I want to see succeed in our neighborhood.   They are friendly, so knowledgeable about baking and offer terrific choices in coffees, teas and bagels."}
{"text":"I had a doctor appointment at the office across the parking lot and after fasting all morning I was ready for a bagel! I've been meaning to get to this place, and it didn't disappoint. I ordered the toasted asiago cheese bagel with veggie cream cheese and a hot chai latte. If you're like me and you like loads of cream cheese on your bagel, this is the place for you.!! The latte was sweet and hot and delicious. The young man behind the counter apologized that he was the only one working that morning to let me know that it might take a little longer than usual. I appreciated him letting me know, but it really didn't take that long! If it had, it would've been worth the wait. Great food, great service."}
{"text":"These bagels are honestly so good and fresh! They have an awesome assortment of cream cheese, which are all delicious. And their cold brew is life changing!"}
{"text":"Very good bagels.  Great selection of cream cheeses.  I had the bacon/horseradish which was good.  The menu is very limited but if you're in the mood for a bagel and coffee, you're in luck.    The bagel and lox was priced well and delicious.  It was $6.50 I believe.  An individual bagel will run you about $2.50 with cream cheese.  There are numerous coffee/tea selections.  The coffee is really good but priced a bit high.    I'm happy to have this option for a quick breakfast in Ahwatukee and look forward to going back."}
{"text":"From Texas and went to Bagel man across from hotel was closed (Monday) and found this place on yelp and glad I did!   Good berry smear et bagel!  All flavors of lattes etc are sugarfree and that is great for a diabetic!!"}
{"text":"The best bagel and atmosphere in Phoenix. There are a few things you have to try; the black pepper & parmesan cheese bagel, the garlic sriracha cream cheese & the Jalapeño hummus. This will be your favorite place in no time."}
{"text":"This was the first bagel shop I visited when I got back from out of country. I'm glad I did! Great customer service with great bagels to match. Perfect mix of light crispy exterior with the soft chewy center. I especially like how they season both sides of the bagel rather than the single sided seasoning job most other bagel shops do. Keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"Odelay is easiest the best bagel I have ever had. They put  in an extreme amount of blood, sweat and tears into creating a perfect bagel that takes 24 hours to complete. The outside is crispy, while in the inside is as soft as can be. Also, the in house smear is amazing and complements the bagel to a T. Do yourself a favor and go to Odelay the next time a craving for bagels hits you, you will not only be receiving an awesome product, but also supporting a local business."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff,  had nice music playing and the decor is hip and modern.  I like that they had local artists paintings up on the wall and they even had a suggestions board for cream cheese and bagel creations.  The bagel I ordered was fresh and very tasty.  Not at all like your typical chain bagel shops!"}
{"text":"I'll admit, I primarily came here for breakfast because of the name Odelay which reminds me of that Beck album. :) I only knew that this place existed actually from seeing a big banner posted on the side of the orthodontics building in this center.   We walked in and was greeted immediately by the friendly cashier. I loved the bagel and cream cheese selections. Some of them are very unique and ones I haven't seen before. I felt like starting my day with some kick in my step so I had a jalapeno cheddar bagel with horseradish bacon cream cheese and a cold brew.  The bagel was nicely toasted and I felt like it had a good amount of cream cheese on it. I couldn't taste a lot of the sharpness that horseradish typically embodies but the creaminess was reminiscent of the type of horseradish sauce you'd find paired with prime rib. The bacon was plentiful and in large chunks and I thought it paired well with the bagel.  I wasn't a big fan of the cold brew, which had too much of an acidic flavor for me.   There's a small little patio in the front with a few tables if you'd like to sit outside. When we got here there was a live performance going on, and while I appreciate that they bring in artists to sing, quite honestly it was really loud and not very relaxing for me to sit inside and hear someone sing in the morning. I don't mean to be harsh, but the singer wasn't very melodic to me and my first thought when I heard her sing Jewel's \"You Were Meant For Me\" off key in the higher octaves was to escape to the patio."}
{"text":"Funny story how I ended up going to Odelay Bagel Company. I was at a local Irish Bar last night and met the owner though and found out he had started up this place only a few months ago. He noted that he had to be up and making bagels at 2 am (baker's hours indeed!). I promised I would come by this morning and check it out. Well, I'm glad I did, he has a lovely establishment and a great selection of freshly made bagels. I bought both the black pepper Parmesan and the Jalapeno cheddar bagels and also the bacon and horseradish and the Italian herbs and chives smear. I also had a chance to say high to the owner again who had indeed, been up early, making all the bagels in the bagel bins.   The bagel type he makes reminds me of Noah's bagels that I've had in Los Angeles, being more of the lighter style of bagel versus the extremely chewy New York style of bagel. The nice thing, certainly makes them easier to slice when you get home (though you can get them toasted and smeared at the establishment.  I noticed that you can also get your bagel with Lox (sorry, not a huge fan of the smoked fish on a bagel but I know many people love it) and the establishment also makes a nice array of coffee based drinks (the store has an espresso machine) and teas, and they have fresh brewed iced tea.  I will say I certainly look forward to going back and trying some of the other bagels and it's nice to see someone successfully starting and running his own business who obviously knows what he's doing.   Oh, when you drive up, the signage above the story says \"Bagels & Coffee\" - the name of the business is on the glass window so you know, that is the place.   My only request, think about a peppercorn potato bagel - it's my favorite one at Noah's in California. Looking forward to my next visit and hearing more of the owner's story about how he got into the bagel business - I only heard a bit of it at the Irish bar but it sounds fascinating.  P.S. - he also employees extremely nice and well-mannered kids from the local high school so when you support this place, you not only get some great bagels and coffee but you support a local business that provides work opportunities for young people in the community, so a win-win all the way around.;-)"}
{"text":"I went to their shop after passing their signage stating \"best bagel in phoenix\"... Not exactly true.. Their bagels are basically dense circular bread. They do have a decent selection of cream cheeses, drinks, and a small variety of bagels but when it comes down to it... Their bagels are mediocre. They arent something I would brag about nor give any type of award for... How the bagel shop down the street didn't win the new times award is beyond me...  The atmosphere in the shop is actually pretty neat. Real hipster vibe using pallets as wall decor and local art hung up on the wall.  My biggest reason for giving a 2 out 5 star is seriously the bagel. When it comes down to it, the hype of the signage around the plaza didn't live up to the expectations of best bagel in town.  Just goes to show that the new times awards are just a high school popularity contest..."}
{"text":"Have been here several times and love it! Fast service, convenient location and the bagels are great! They also serve breakfast sandwiches which are very good. The atmosphere is relaxed with an urban feel, very comfortable. You can bring your dogs to sit out on the patio with you. Quaint and cool! Oh, and the coffee is GOOD!!"}
{"text":"Quality people. Quality products. Cold brew coffee is a must have over summer and pair it with fresh bagels, and you have a winning combo. I'll definitely be back to try more of their variety! Their cream cheese is so good. I had the Italian herbs and chives and it was so good. Seriously one of the best I've ever had. The bagels are all so fresh, and the toppings/ingredients are all top of the line and the quality comes through in the finished product."}
{"text":"Amazing bagels and coffee!! The service is also incredible! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Delicious bagels, choice coffee, and a down to earth staff. On my first trip, I was met by the owner, Ryan. Real approachable and friendly guy. He offered some advice as to what went well together, so I took his advice on it and felt satisfied with my meal. I'd highly recommend anyone give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Awesome hole in the wall bagel shop. Great homemade bagels, cream cheese and lox. My wife and I have been to bagel shops all over az and this is by far our favorite. Everything is consistently good and the people are always extremely friendly and fast."}
{"text":"I have to say I absolutely loved my bagel here. I went after 1:00 pm and there were still a lot of the popular flavors left like chocolate chip. They have a large variety of bagels as well as cream cheese which was a nice surprise.   I had a toasted chocolate chip bagel with honey almond cream cheese. I was so impressed with the cream cheese. It had a perfect balance of cream cheese and honey and then they sprinkled a dusting of finely diced almonds. The end result was amazing. I don't have a photo because I ate it all which rarely happens. Looking forward to going back and trying more of their flavors."}
{"text":"Great tasting, fresh bagels! Beats a bunch of places on the east coast!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place sooooo badly. Here's the deal, their bagels are a tasty form of bread but in my opinion they're not authentic East coast style bagels which is what I was hoping for. They're just not correct in that regard. Outer part is wrong texture, inside wrong density, flavor wrong. That doesn't mean that as a piece of bread it wasn't good or wasn't tasty, it's just not really a \"real\" bagel. It should also be said that most people don't care about real bagels, but for me, these are a pass. I gave them 2 stars for nice atmosphere, friendly staff and having Infusion brand coffee but I wouldn't. It the bagels again. For me the search continues!"}
{"text":"Best bagel I've had outside of NYC. Friendly staff. And water outside as I pass by on a run. Small and great vibe... sure it's a bit pricier than a chain, but so worth it."}
{"text":"Always fresh always friendly service. Ryan has the best bagels and cream cheese with unique flavors I have found. Love the black pepper parmesan bagel with garlic siracha cream cheese. You will not regret it!!"}
{"text":"Great staff and delicious egg sandwiches...also great iced coffee! Also they have water and water bowls for dogs outside, which is cool. I one time saw a really awkward customer be a meany to the manager and they handled it like a champion. Two thumbs up"}
{"text":"I LOVE odelay, everyone is so welcoming and accommodating. The prices beat any other competitors by a mile for what you get, the nice man at the register Quinn was kind enough to help me make a decision when I couldn't. He was also very informative of the menu and allowed my sister to get what she wanted by adjusted to her dairy free lifestyle! Thanks so much to the family of odelay, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I'm an east coast bagel snob and holyyyyyyy! I never write Yelp reviews but this place is so good! Bought a bakers dozen for 20! Awesome price and great quality! Def go here people."}
{"text":"These are the best bagels east of Chicago; hand formed, proofed overnight, and boiled before baking, producing a true bagel - crunchy crust and chewey inside.The lox beats most deli's, and if you are not a fan of smoked fish, the sandwiches are also delicious. Coffee is roasted for them and they know how to make true espresso drinks - no fake pinarello foaming up the milk."}
{"text":"Great selection of bagels and spreads you've never heard of before!"}
{"text":"Hands down best bagels! So tasty. Worth the drive if your wanting good food and the vibe is great too. They know what they're doing for sure!"}
{"text":"What an awesome bagel shop. I think this bagel shop could be the revitalization, the shopping center at the bottom of Equestrian needs. It has a very hip environment, and the owner Ryan and staff are easy going, fun loving people, that help make the atmosphere. Odelay is exactly the type of shop that Ahwatukee needs more of.   The quality of the bagel is impressively crafted, with a crunch to the outer shell and a nice fluffy inside. I go at lunch time and their tea and turkey bagel sandwich is incredible... I've been to Odelay Bagel for 4 days straight this week. If you are a local resident and you want more spots like this, come and show your patronage.   *They are still new and still figuring out processes so the service is a little on the slow side. So don't go if you're in a big rush. But give them some time and they will have that ironed out for sure."}
{"text":"By far the best bagels I've had in the valley! You won't be disappointed! I highly recommend odelay bagels."}
{"text":"One of the best bagels I have had in my entire life, and in walking distance from my friend's house in Phoenix. They offer a large variety of bagels and cream cheeses, in many interesting flavors. I loved their wheat bagel with strawberry and cinnamon cream cheese, and wish I could have tried more.  They also offer many coffee selections. I got an iced americano, and it was the biggest ice coffee I have ever gotten. And the price was fantastic! The staff was super friendly and helped me pick out cream cheeses. Service was also quick and food/coffee was prepared exactly like I wanted it. Odelay is definitely the best bagels in the state of AZ, so make sure you check them out!"}
{"text":"My eggs, bacon and ham was heat up in a microwave. The eggs were hard and the bagel was soggy for some reason. Overall I'm not going back. It was gross. I only decided to try it because the bagel man was closed"}
{"text":"Love this place! Came in for lunch and had the turkey bacon swiss bagley sandwich.  Super fast service, delicious food and inviting atmosphere. What more could you want? Been here for breakfast and enjoined great coffee. Tucked in the strip center at Equestrian and Warner/Elliot Loop. Stop by and find this little jewel, you will be glad you did."}
{"text":"Deliciousness! Applies to coffee, bagels, and smears. I have not yet been since additional food items have been added to the menu, but am very much looking forward to checking out the new menu offerings!  Current favorite smear is the Italian Herb. I love the unique flavors of smears!  Coffee is amazing, even the decaf!!!  Bagels are super fresh.  I hope they do well in the location. Even knowing how good the food and coffee is, on the days when time is short and I need to get to work quickly, I choose an alternative venue due to the proximity. If it was located along 48th Street, I'd be there every morning!!!"}
{"text":"Great tasting fresh bagels with exceptional espresso! Had am everything bagel with lox, was not disappointed at all with this price point. The owner is fun and talkative, outdoor seating, and hipster-esque interior are welcome additions to this quiet location near hiking and biking trails."}
{"text":"Their Black Pepper Parmesan Bagel with Italian Herb & Chive Cream Cheese is a heavenly combo! Even better when you add the lox, tomato and capers."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!! Very welcoming and relaxing and the bagels are fantastic!! Can't wait to try all of the cream cheese combos. :) Über yummmm coffee drinks too!"}
{"text":"We love this place. Customer service is awesome and bagels are amazing.  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"This is the closest thing to NY bagels but... it's BETTER than any bagel I've ever had in NY.  Endless possibilities. Knowledgeable staff and fun atmosphere.  If you like a really good cup of coffee this is the place! Very reasonable prices. $2.25 for the best bagel and cream cheese in the valley. Unique bagel options such as Black Pepper Parmesan and Dill Rye go great with their fresh made smears such as Italian herbs & chive, spinach feta, horseradish bacon and many more. So happy to have found this place"}
