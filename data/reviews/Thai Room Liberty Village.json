{"text":"Ordered from foodora, fast delivery and food was hot hot hot.  Ordered the dinner for two. too much sauce in the red curry chicken ? Pad Thai was okay but I'm not a fan of tofu and there was a lot.  Probably won't order again as it didn't really hit the spot."}
{"text":"I ordered shrimp pad Thai and it was really mediocre. The sauce is subpar. It's like the McDonald's quality level of Thai food. Over priced for what you get."}
{"text":"This Thai restaurant serves some of the worst Thai in Toronto. If you want a completely westernized experience, here is your place. The majority of the dishes have heaps of green pepper so that's the foundation of the dishes, they put lots of sugar into them also, so it tastes like a Chinese food fair dish, and to top it off, they don't use fresh chili, they put dried out ones that have been left to dry and taste moldy and horrible. I have tried this a few times because it is in my local neighborhood, and I can't say I really have enjoyed it once. I have told them about what authentic Thai is like (spoke to the manager) and I went back only to find even more green pepper chunks and sugary syrup all over it... BLAH."}
{"text":"Pretty good neighbourhood thai place. Very quick service, and generous portions. If you don't feel like cooking this is a great place to order from in liberty village"}
{"text":"Avoid at all costs!  Ordered for pickup.  Sat in the restaurant for an hour waiting for a simple order.  Very slow.  When order arrived I went home, opened it up, and found it incorrect.  At this point all I wanted was to get a hero burger but the staff at the restaurant claimed they could not provide a refund - I had to talk to a non-present manager.  I was able to get a refund for the missing item.  I will never return to Thai Room."}
{"text":"Ordered the pad thai and it was not good. The sauce tasted like a jar/can bought and NOT HOMEMADE (if homemade then that recipe is not good).  Missing bean sprouts even in the Pad Thai. Pad Thai was not good at all overall.   ordered the green curry chicken. Again horrible dish. Lacking flavour and not spicy. Weak dish.  The green mango salad was nice, thank goodness."}
{"text":"Have ordered takeout from here twice now.   The first time we ordered soups we had never had before and they were ok - however we will never order again.    The more recent time we ordered pad thai (one regular and one curry). The portions were very generous, the food was ready quickly and this was by far the best pad thai we have had yet.   Glad that we gave this spot a second chance!"}
{"text":"Everything tasted old. It made my wife sick as well. Delivery was quick on Just Eat, but I would rather wait for fresh food."}
{"text":"Today (9/2/2015 lunch), it was my first time buying take-out from this place.  Overall, I have to say \"Very disappointed\" in both food N staff.  I picked up the take-out paper menu and called to order pad thai with chicken, stir fried glass noodles with chicken and shrimp, mixed market vegetables from Lunch Special menu.  The girl who picked the phone was not very nice.  I inquired her about \"10% for $20 or more for pick up only. Not valid with any other offers or coupons\" shown on the menu, and she just asked me if I want to take the 10% discount and that's all.  Then she told me the total bill which didn't add up to my calculation and I questioned about it.  She said that 10% only applies to regular price order, but it didn't say \"including lunch menu\".  So, I told her to forget about the 10% and I just take the lunch special menu.  Then she told me that only chicken available for stir fried glass noodles.  I told her the menu said \"chicken or shrimps\" and asked her to check.  She replied she has been working there for a long time and knows her menus, N refused to look at it.  I found that it is very misrepresented on both the menu and the staff working there.  She then apologized when I picked up the food but the damage was already made (food was already cooked).  The owner should look into it and ensure that the staff are fully trained and their knowledge is up-to-date."}
{"text":"I've come here once. Just before the lunch rush.   I ordered three items off the menu. Spicy beef, fried chicken wings, and pad thai. I enjoyed them all.   Service was great. One was training and new. I'll definitely come again. Probably not during a rush though, because it gets busy."}
{"text":"I didn't really like the food here. I ordered online and delivery was prompt so props for that, but the pad thai I ordered didn't taste good at all! Would not buy from here again! :("}
{"text":"Horrible take out service. Always when you call the waitress put you on a hold and never comes back. This happens not once or twice every time I think of ordering a pick up.  Once I went in restaurant. I specifically mentioned twice No Egg as I am alergic. They still put egg in my dish. I called waitress then she said I forgot to mention.  Horrible service.  2 stars are only for food."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by this place! Tried it for the first time recently with my boyfriend and we were both impressed with the quality, flavour and value. Got takeout and service was prompt and friendly. Ordered the Lemon Vegetable Tom Yum soup which had a nice sourness to the broth, and the Malay Curry Chicken which had a great variety of fresh vegetables along with a tasty sauce (with some heat behind it- perfect amount for me). Portions were very reasonable for the price point, especially with the 10% discount for pickup. Will definitely be returning to try it again!"}
{"text":"I called in my pick up order- their website said 10% off for pick up orders only- they denied this, saying it's only for dinner menus and not lunch (where does it say that?) so they did not honour it.  When I went to pick up my order I received zero smiles or thank yous. Two women were staring at me with such intense suspicion I felt as if I was robbing them somehow. They made me feel extremely uncomfortable and as if I were unwelcome.  So due to their lackluster food, their horrible service and inability to honour discounts clearly noted on their website, this will be my first and last visit to Thai Room in LV.   Go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Great Mango Salad! Chicken Malay curry is tasty! And the golden curry is so yummy! The curry padthai is better than the regular one. We have only done takeout - quick and food is hot when delivered!"}
{"text":"Just moved to the area and ordered takeout from here. Had the crispy tofu and Malay curry chicken. Both dishes were very tasty but what surprised me the most was the amount of food delicious food you got for the price- they were not skimpy on the chicken in the curry and I actually had enough in the tofu appetizer itself to consider it a meal. Another plus was that they have a $25 minimum delivery order, compared to most places in the area that wouldn't deliver to me because I hadn't ordered enough. I'm definitely going to order from these folks again!"}
{"text":"Amazing service, food, and peanut sauce. Staff were friendly and beyond accomodating! I ordered the samosas to start and the chili chicken as a main and both were beyond expectations. will def be back"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was quiet, and the service was good. I usually order a few items, and provided they are delicious I stick with them for good. If I had to pick something to change it would be the option to switch the steamed rice out for fried rice; however, in order to do so it would be at an added cost. It also seems like the waiting staff keeps on changing (been twice in a row different waitress). Not sure if it's that hard to find reliable help now-a-days."}
{"text":"I order in often, and being so close to Thai room  I used to get it weekly. But after awhile it was just not as good.   I found that ordering the same few items over and over they were just not the same. Curry pad Thai, with lemon? Without? Bok Choi ? You get the point. Some nights the food was very good, others not so much.    I've have had difficulties many times with the staff and the whole 10% discount. They are basically guilty of false advertising. Dinner for 2? No discount! Want to switch an item? No you can't. Why? No clue because last week it was no problem.    I also find it quite pricy. $14 for chicken curry pad Thai? Rice noodles are dirt cheap! Not to mention I'm picking it up myself. I do find the lemongrass soup to be good. No complaints there. But lack of consistency, and a pricy menu have me heading  into the twilight of my Thai room days.  Overall score: 2.1"}
{"text":"This place is sketchy !!! I have no idea how they are still opened in liberty village. There's no one eating inside. Came here on a weekend. I felt extremely uncomfortable while the 3 servers was staring at my table the whole night because we were the only customers inside.  2 stars for having parking and the service was relatively fast since there was 3 servers and 1 table on a weekend night.  The food seemed suspicious to me. I had a strong feeling they are recycling the chicken and noodles because they don't want to throw it out. Non of the dishes I ordered tasted fresh like other Thai restaurants. Probably won't come here again. Very disappointed by my experience ! Probably explains why we were the only customers eating inside."}
{"text":"First time eating here and was very impressed. Best coconut rice I've ever had. So much coconut milk! The pad Thai was really good too - very saucey which I liked as I find many places do it so dry and bland.  Red curry had great flavour. Take out had generous portions. Definitely not my last time ordering from here!"}
{"text":"Meh.... I ordered online and it said it would take 45 mins, so I waited patiently and walked over after 45 mins was up. When I arrived I had to wait an extra 10 mins even though my food was sitting on the counter in a brown bag.  I had the Pad Thai, which was ok. It had decent flavour and the portion size was HUGE... however I was just not over the moon about it. (plus, it had Tofu in it and the online menu description did not list that)"}
{"text":"This place has to go too.. WOrst thai food I agree. Cheap ingredients."}
{"text":"I went there once. Only because I had guests from out of country visiting. It was a big mistake. Food was lower than average and pricey. I spent $160 for 4 people. I have experienced a LOT of Thai places in life. This is most definitely not one of the good ones. The food quality was poor. Presentation was poor.  Sometimes, small quantity but good quality matters more. I don't mind spending money on good food, but perhaps, I should have visited some other place."}
{"text":"Food came quickly, but my girlfriend found a hard, rock like thing in a spring roll when she chipped her tooth on it.  Restaurant did not care whatsoever.  Disappointing."}
{"text":"Just called to order something for delivery. Had asked the lady on the phone if they deliver for lunch specials. She abruptly said no they don't even have lunch special on the weekend and proceeded to hang up. No customer service whatsoever. With such poor reviews I wonder if they will fix some of these problems. The Vaughan location was my favourite for so long and was hoping this one would be as good but didn't even get that far."}
{"text":"Avoid while Flu season is up, my girlfriend and I got the stomach flu after ordering the shrimp pad thai."}
{"text":"We got good delivery from here last night and  YUM yum yum!!! First of all I love the option for delivery by just eat it's super convenient. It only took about  30-40 mins to get to us too! Gotta love it. I got the fried rice with beef and my bf had the beed pad Thai and both were amazing!!!! It's a little pricey for take out but for what we paid we got enough good for atleast 3 more solid meals so no complaints here."}
{"text":"I've ordered takeout from Thai Room many (many) times. Like other reviewers, I've had issues with their \"10% off for pick-up\". Sometimes they deny the offer exists.. They've often forgot to put things in our bag as well. This happened a couple times with spring rolls, soup and peanuts (which is honestly heartbreaking when you're looking forward to pad thai).   Overall, you'll find pretty good thai food here and I'm generally happy with the food itself. I usually order the same menu items and rarely are they the same. My favourite is the curry pad thai. The flavour is usually very good, but sometimes it's just better - saucier, more tofu/chicken, random vegetables make an appearance, etc."}
{"text":"For some reason, my order never came through even though I clearly pointed out to the server what I wanted on the menu. I sat there waiting for over 30 minutes, thinking that maybe my dish takes a while to make, while all of my friends got their food way ahead. I told the server about it and she came back with our group's receipt, reading out everyone's order just to double-check, but my order wasn't even on it. She came back and said that apparently my order was thought to be a delivery (???), so they made me a new one. By the time my food came, most of my friends were done eating and I've lost my appetite. What made me confused was that the place wasn't even packed; in fact, there were many empty tables, so the slowness of the service doesn't even add up.  The only good thing about this place was the server. She was very nice and sweet when she talks to the customers. It just sucks that I'm giving a bad review for this place."}
{"text":"I'd give this place 3.5.  This is our go to takeout place for Thai when we are too lazy and don't want to cook or eat at a restaurant. They do have seating if you want to eat dinner here as well.  The food is good and fast. We usually get the Pad Thai and the Spicy seafood noodles. In the spicy noodles there is a good amount of various seafood, and the noodles have a nice kick to it. I enjoy the pad thai because it's not too sweet and the sauce isn't too ketchupy like some places.   If you are craving Thai food in the area, I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"I've been here for lunch before and it's a nice place to eat-in. We ordered it for delivery last night and were pleased.   We got the red curry, which was tasty but a bit thin, and the peanut chicken, which was good. The spring rolls were good also but the sauce could use some acidity/tang as it was a bit too sweet.   All-in-all, the food was good and the delivery was quick. We haven't tried many thai places in Toronto and while we may experiment with others, we wouldn't hesitate to come back to the Thai Room."}
{"text":"Pro : Great service, nice looking restaurant, food i was delicious and not over spicy. Good Portion.  Con : A bit expensive for Rice and chicken  Curry after all about 18$."}
{"text":"Most Thai restaurants in Toronto get 0 stars in my books, so a 3 is a pretty high score. What is it with Thai food in this city? We have so much multi national culinary delights yet on the that front TO disappoints... Our neighbours to the south fare a lot better, cheaper and more authentically in almost any town you go to. Having said that, Thai room LV is close to my home, friendly albeit a little pricey.  The food is good and the portions feed multiple. I'm a big fan of the basil tofu and green curry. Recommend."}
{"text":"Very polite and awesome service, big fan of that!  Food is well made, good ingredients, not the most interesting Thai I've had, and their combos are not very... exciting. But the food is comfort thai, and it hits the spot when you need Spicy fried rice and Chicken/Shrimp Pad Thai. The spicy beef curry is quite nice as well. Overall, impressed with service, prompt delivery and their basic but well made fare!"}
{"text":"Terrible service, we ordered take out and was told it will be ready in 20 min. On top of the 20 min we had to wait another 30 min. When I asked why is taking so long I was told that they are short staff. When we placed the order the could've mentioned that it'll take so long so we don't actually have to waste our lunch break just waiting in the restaurant. They didn't even apologized to us :( Unless something is done about the service will never go back!"}
{"text":"I discovered Thai Room about a year ago when I got a flyer in the mail.  I decided to give them a try and ordered take out with a coupon I received in the mail and I am so glad I did!  Everything I have ordered from them has been really good.  I have tried the mango salad, vegetable spring rolls, green curry chicken, cashew nut chicken, Pad Thai, mango sticky rice, and more that I can't remember.  I have loved everything I've ever tried and I would highly recommend Thai Room.  Recently I visited their restaurant (usually I order take out) and the service was quick and our waitress was very friendly and attentive.  It wasn't too busy and they have comfortable, spacious booths to enjoy a nice meal with family and/or friends."}
{"text":"After an afternoon of shopping for furniture, my friend Emma P. and I stopped in here for a late lunch/early dinner.  The place looks pretty low key, very clean and nice decor.  We ordered shrimp chips and dip, whole fried red snapper with yellow curry,  lamb curry and a bottle of Pinot Grigio to wash it all down with.  The shrimp chips were really good, but the dip they were served with was absolutely amazing!  Both the lamb curry and the red snapper were delicious, as was the wine (but that goes without saying).  Our server was really nice and friendly, the place didn't have many people in it, but they were killing it in take out and delivery orders.  There must have been 10 ordered picked up while we were eating our meal.  Overall, I really liked this place...good food, good service and good price point."}
{"text":"So we get these coupons in the mail for free appetizers or pad thai if we order so much food at the Thai Room. So besides the 20% off which expired end of January the other coupons had no expiry date. When we placed our order we were told the coupons were only good for lunch which wasn't stated anywhere, and that the coupons had expired. Even though this wasn't stated anywhere on the coupons they wouldn't allow us to use them. The waiter also told us they were having problems with other people coming in and not being able to use the coupons.   While waiting for our food we noticed that they were still handing out the coupons at the bar and when you first enter the restaurant.  Seems like a scam to me. On top of that the food wasn't all that great. Pad thai was probably one of the worst I've tried and the food was pretty expensive.  This place just opened up, Not sure how they are going to succeed."}
{"text":"Tried the mango chicken here and it was pretty awful. Bland and way too sweet for my liking. Its really pricey too. Service is fine hence the 2 stars."}
{"text":"Pros: Great food, amazing quality of meat; quick service, great customer service Cons: A bit too much Tofu in the pad Thai so if you are not a fan of tofu get reduced amount."}
{"text":"I've always had a positive experience here. The food is good. Nothing mind blowing but for the price, you get a good portion size and the flavours are there. I would recommend Thai Room for anyone in Liberty Village as it's quick, close and reliable."}
{"text":"Tucked away in a corner of Liberty Village. If you blink, you might just miss this spot.   I had ordered four dishes and for me the standout was the red curry chicken. The rest of the items I had were okay. Had to try the ginger chicken. It's one of my faves in Thai cuisine but this one had a slight bitter after taste. The chicken satay and spring rolls were good but in comparison to other spots in the city, I may try some other selections first before this.  I have to say though, customer service and atmosphere were a definite plus. Really like how helpful and patient they were with my onslaught of questions.   Though it may not be number one for Thai, I have to say, for a neighbourhood dining out spot its a nice change from the surrounding pubs,"}
{"text":"We decided to check out this thai place in our neighbourhood on a Thursday night. It took us a good 15 mins to find this place after reaching the designated address. The plaza is really big and this place is located just behind the Brazen head bar on E Liberty street. We came to find a deserted restaurant. We were just crossing our fingers that it wasn't going to be a terrible experience. The ambiance was quite nice but the staff was talking a bit loudly and we could hear them complain about take out customers. While we were seated, there were quite a few customers who came in to get take out.   The waitress was prompt in taking our orders and getting our drinks. We ordered the red curry with chicken and the Thai fried rice. We were pleasantly surprised with the flavours. The rice was quite delicious and the curry was good too. During our dinner I noticed that an insect had fallen in to the curry. We alerted the waitress promptly who offered to replace the dish for us. Overall we enjoyed our experience. We will be back to try more dishes!"}
{"text":"I think this is the epitome of a 3-star restaurant. This is my goto for if i'm working late at the office, but it's pretty much only because Liberty Village doesn't have many reasonably priced options. Their pad thai is not very good - it's not ketchupy, at least, but the seasoning isn't really there. Same goes for the spring rolls - they're bland and i can barely tell when i'm eating filling or dough. On the other hand, the green curry is quite good, as is the mango chicken.  Service is super friendly, and food comes quickly."}
{"text":"I am liking it more now that they have a much more extensive menu. I've tried every single thing on the menu, since I've been coming here for over three years. The red curry is still my favorite, followed by the green curry. The noodles , pad Thai etc are not especially great here so stick with the curries. The appetizers are also good, especially the shrimp rolls.   Important note: in the three years coming here I've never had a delivery order and do not plan to, ever. Deliveries are just a horrible idea, and the food is ALWAYS worse when delivered or even picked up. Do yourself a favor, and quit the habit of chomping on food in front of your tv and come down and sit down in the restaurant and have a proper dining experience and proper food quality."}
{"text":"My group of 5 came in on a Saturday at around 8pm. There weren't many people seated in the restaurant. 4 tables were occupied. It took them a few minutes to greet us and then seat us. Another 10 minutes for them to bring us water and menus. There were only two ladies working there. The decor was nice and place was quite clean. We finally put our order in 20 minutes later. The waitress apologized she said the phones were ringing non stop. It seems to be a hot spot for Ritual orders and take out. That was probably priority. Food was delicious. I got a Tom yam soup and beef skewers.  Just like Thailand! Only downfall was the service and wait time.  If you are not in a rush I recommend going here. But take out seems just fine."}
{"text":"Asked for rice noodles, got rice instead.  Also their definition of grilling seems to be what an average person would call frying.  Taste is fine. Otherwise not satisfied."}
{"text":"Ordered from Thai Room for 1st time tonight: food delivered hot within 30 minutes. All 3 dishes -- springrolls, mango salad & mango chicken -- were fresh & delicious. Delivery guy was friendly, helpful & courteous. I'll definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Not quite as authentic as other places in the city (ie Sukothai and affiliated restos), but definitely a step above the diluted flavours of the average Thai resto in Toronto. Dishes taste a bit on the safe side, sweeter, and lacks heat. I requested hot sauce on the side, thinking I would get chills, but instead received Sriracha from the bottle. Overall, still a 3.5 star Thai experience, given the value and cleanliness.  Service is as good as it can be for a place that is severely understaffed. Only 2 servers for busy lunch time crowd. They managed dine-in, bar, regular takeout, and ritual orders. Despite the lack of service I received, I still tipped them extra because they were so overworked and doing a half decent job of keeping things afloat. To"}
{"text":"This place isn't bad, but it's nothing to write home about. It's close to work, and doesn't take too long for food to show up. The place is clean and service is decent.  I usually order the chicken green curry and rice, which always arrives hot (which I like). I've heard the pad Thai is underwhelming and the other noodle dishes have generally the same underwhelming reviews from my friends.  It's a very safe Thai place."}
{"text":"I ordered and had the worst experience ever. It was lunch time, the driver call me to say that he can not park and that I need to come downstairs if I want my delivery. Thing is I was pretty sick with a big headache, so I explained to him. He ended up knocking 5 mn later at the door, knocking like crazy on the door really loud, so I just mentioned that my headache was still pretty strong. He said \" I dont care if you are sick\". Nice. Then I had this unnecessary speech about how far my condo is, and that I should have come downstairs. And that morning customers bothers him. Seriously?? I told him to shut up, as he was really agressive and my head couldn't stand it anymore. then he started to yell so I closed the door. 5 mn later, phone call from the deliver man mambling something in another language with fake girl voice. I just can believe it ! so I called the restaurant, explained it, manager calls back a few days after, saying how sorry they are and that it inadmissible. That they will get back at me with a commercial gesture to apologize. 1 month after, nothing. I call to order some food, and the same guy come to deliver. I say I remember you, he replies yes the girl who were sick I remember! He denied calling me of course, saying that he was not stupid enough to call me with his phone ( well smartass, you did and I have screenshots) anyway, I give him the money and a bill fall on the floor. As the gentleman he is, he point it and said \"pick up\" excuse me ??? \" pick up\" . I can t believe what is happening!! He ended up leaving the food on the floor and taking the bill. UNBELIEVABLE!!!!! Special mention to a portion of rice paid but not in my order. I called back the restaurant ( it was yesterday) and gave my phone number again, nobody even  contacted me. This guys are a joke, disrespectful, unprofessional, just order somewhere else. Edit : it s been a month, I called a few times and ask to have a manager called me back... still no heard from them!"}
{"text":"Best Thai in Liberty Village. Their delivery is quick and if you order online you get free spring rolls and Samosas*wink wink*.  I've had the Shrimp Pad Thai, Chili Chicken, Mango Chicken, Coconut Mango chicken and they have been a hit everyone! We also get the spring rolls and coconut rice to share. All delicious"}
{"text":"Been here few times after discovering it thanks to my co-worker.  They have decent chicken pineapple fried rice - kinda wish they have more chicken in it - as it's spread out pretty scarcely compared to the amount of rice.  Pad thai is nothing special - it's a bit too sweet compared to other pad-thai specialized places in Toronto.  Price isn't great but it's actually not bad considering other places in Liberty.  The service is okay and there are ample amount of seatings all the time."}
{"text":"I realize there are many negative reviews about this place but I couldn't disagree more!  This place is awesome! very convenient location, incredible food and very generous serving sizes. The interior is pleasant and the service is very friendly.   I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who loves thai as much as I do!"}
{"text":"Food: 2/5  Didn't know a green curry could taste sweet.   Service: 1.5/5 was told we only had a limit amount of time.   Price: 1/5  Pricey maybe because they have some nice renos"}
{"text":"Pretty okay.   Ordered the:  coconut cashew veggie- very peculiar meal, thick vegetables and no real flavour. Also had 3-4 pieces of cashew only.   Pad Thai- generic   Spring rolls are delicious   Sticky rice is good"}
{"text":"Have ordered from here a few times (eat in, and delivery).    Staff has always been great, and the food is always good.  I have always enjoyed my dish every time I've ordered - and I'm always willing to try new dishes there.    They are very eerily empty every time I go, but the service is great, so I don't really have any complaints.    Nothing super amazing to rave about - although a friend of mine LOVES and SWEARS by their curry."}
{"text":"The food is average, but the service is terrible. They brought the curry without rice and had us sitting there waiting, brought the wrong dishes twice to our table, took an extremely long time to get us the bill, and tried to charge us for the two mistaken orders. On top of that our server seemed to hate life. Don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"Terrible food.  Will probably never return.  Over seasoned, over cooked noodles, and the chicken was rough. The pad thai I ordered is nowhere near how good pad thai tastes. The overwhelming amount of seasoning put into the dish  basically cloaked any sign of taste from the ingredients. I would love to write a longer review but there's not much to say because my dining experience ended on the first bite; too much salt.  It also really bothered me that the restaurant wastes a huge leaf of raw veg on garnishing the dish; it's very obvious they don't use this veg on anything else so are they really just waste good vegetables to \"garnish\" the dish? (I'd like to add the end product was not aesthetically pleasing)  With the abundance of Thai restaurants available in Toronto I'd recommend skipping this one, you won't miss much. There are also far better options for food just inside Liberty Village, and resorting to this restaurant should never be needed."}
{"text":"A quick update to let y'all know that they're also on foodora and their vegetarian lunch for two is enough for four. Delicious tofu and spices for all!"}
