{"text":"I like their pizza and subs, the large meatball sub is good and really two meals in one !"}
{"text":"The prices are reasonable and the food is good.  Portions are decent. Had a salad with my eggplant parmesan and was darn near full just from the salad. Atmosphere is lacking, but the staff are friendly. I would recommend!"}
{"text":"I ordered last minute takeout on a Friday from this location, and it was excellent. The staff were friendly, and the restaurant appears clean (although not very big). The fettuccine Alfredo with broccoli was great, not greasy or too heavy, and a very large portion. The mozzarella sticks were huge, and I had another meal for the next day with the large portions of everything. The meal was very affordable as well, and I would definitely order from here again."}
