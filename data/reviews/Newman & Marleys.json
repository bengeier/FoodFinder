{"text":"Best hotdog and sausage I've ever eaten along with the best prices around.  You definitely get your money's worth and the owner Jerry is a great all around guy."}
{"text":"I seriously thought that \"religious experience\" hot dogs were only available in New York city or Fenway Park.  I was wrong.  Jerry, the guy who runs the cart makes an incredible dog.  While I was ordering people were coming up and telling him how good they were.  The \"Jerry Dog\" is easily the best hot dog I have had yet.  5 stars, dude!  Wow!"}
{"text":"Newman and Marley's as it is known now is beyond amazing. The skinless weiner experience is like no other. You must get the pretzel bun...beyond religious experience. Big thanks to Jerry who is super cool owner and makes the cart unique. Put on your weekly to do list. Your taste buds will thank you."}
{"text":"I've been eating at this food truck for years. Only issue I have with them is they don't move around. I've worked Downtown for years and can only eat here when I'm close by. The food is fresh, delicious and they are friendly. The prices are very affordable and some of their special items over the years include pretzel buns and crabcake sandwiches which are both amazing. I love sodas you don't see everyday and they have Cherokee Red with is my favorite strawberry soda. I've tried all the menu items hot dogs, sausage and kielbasa I've never been disappointed. In the Spring and Summer I certainly take advantage of the opportunity to grab a hot dog and sit in the park while people watching."}
