{"text":"Fanucces is a great classic college spot. It has the great family feel you look for in a local spot and you can get great pizza at an affordable price. The staff is kind and will remember your name. If you're looking for a quick affordable bite, I suggest stopping here."}
{"text":"Stopped by Fanucces for lunch after dropping a package off at Amazon next door. I figured, why not stop and try something new?  I'm glad I did. Being in the middle of CSU's campus, they probably get a lot of business.  When I walked in, I was greeted and I perused the menu. I asked if there were any lunch specials and I was told they offered a slice of pizza, two bread sticks, and a refreshment for $6.99. For the same price, they also offered lasagna, bread stick, and refreshment, which is what I opted for. I grabbed a Fanta orange soda from the refrigerator and drank some of it while I found a seat, snapped a few photos, and checked in on yelp. A minute later, my name was called and my steaming hot lasagna and bread stick were sitting on the counter.  I returned to my seat and took a couple pictures of the food. Then I tasted the lasagna and it was spectacular! It had a lot of yummy sauce on it, which I really love. It was soft and cheesy - perfect! The bread stick had garlic butter melted on it and it was perfect for cleaning my plate with after I finished the lasagna.  I wish Fanucces was closer to my office as I would definitely eat here more often. I found the lasagna to be better than Vincenza's. I wonder if they're pizza is better too."}
