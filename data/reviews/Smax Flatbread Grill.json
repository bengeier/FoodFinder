{"text":"Bread and lamb both tasted good and fresh. Service is also good."}
{"text":"Delicious lamb gyro! Added grilled mushrooms, onions and peppers as well as their amazing roasted red pepper sauce. Would have been 5 stars if they had hot sauce!"}
{"text":"Very very good! The cucumber sauce and roasted red pepper sauces are delicious and tastes so fresh!"}
{"text":"This food truck comes to my office once a week and today I decided to give them a try. I ordered the lamb gyro and it was great.  They give you a very generous amount of lamb. The staff was smiling and joking around with each other. I always think if people are enjoying their work than it shows in their product."}
{"text":"This is a new food truck to our office in SouthPark. I have been twice.  My first meal was a Lamb Gyro, which was great.  Lots of lamb, tzatziki, and trimmings.  $8 includes the tax, which is nice. and I felt the sandwich was a good value.    This week I tried the Greek Salad, and was not so impressed. It was a generic chopped iceberg lettuce salad, with bits of tomato, cuke, peppers, along with a few slices of the canned sliced black olives (not kalamata) and a VERY few tiny pieces of feta - this doesn't pass at Greek Salad to me. I think you can do better.  But I'll be back to try another sandwich."}
{"text":"This truck regularly comes to my office campus and I'm glad I finally tried it.  I got the steak philly with pasta salad and would order it again.  Friendly staff and cooked quick.  Definitely worth a try if you see this truck out and about."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times now. Tzatziki is outstanding and definitely homemade. The gyros and the Philly cheesecake are the only things I've eaten, but would highly recommend."}
