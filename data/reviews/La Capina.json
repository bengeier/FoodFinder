{"text":"We ate here a few years ago. Not sure it has changed. The service was fine, but the food was terrible. We reached ordered a pasta, one tomato one some kind of white sauce. They were gross. It was like ketchup and Kraft dinner, but nearly as satisfying. This is not traditional or tasty Italian. I will not return."}
{"text":"So sad that la capina is no more. One of my families favourite spots to gather for baptism, communion, graduation etc. chef always came out to speak with us. Was very accommodating with the menu. Never once told they couldn't make a change in regards to the menu. We had made a reservation at a different restaurant for a baptism and the restaurant was closed with no notice. The owners of la capina  it only accommodated our party last minute, they even opened the doors early just for us. Quaint atmosphere. Large portions. Good people. Going to miss this place."}
{"text":"Amazing food - absolutely love the gnocchi - Gorgonzola sauce is great but they allow you to switch up the sauces and I always go for the Arrabiata sauce.  Great service, reasonable prices.    They also have gluten free selections and a children's menu."}
