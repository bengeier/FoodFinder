{"text":"If you have any sort of event, make a cake here! I ordered two custom cakes for an engagement party from this Menchies. The owner, Mark, was helpful in making suggestions on how to create a unique cake, and did whatever he could to make the design on top exactly what I wanted to bring joy to the couple. 
Not only were there exponential possibilities of ingredients for creating your own cake, but they were delicious too! If you are craving frozen yogurt, need a custom cake, or just want to hang out in an uplifting environment, come to this Menchies."}
{"text":"The people who work at this Location are always so nice! I was so excited to see a location open up by me when I relocated here from Florida. Keep up the delicious work!!!"}
{"text":"I tried the mix berry and grapefruit ones, the berry tasted too artificial and the grapefruit tasted like orange....the only upside is their toppings, a lot of choices and fresh but I won't go back again, I prefer more natural flavoring so I can taste more yogurt."}
{"text":"Super frustrating experience here. Arrived to a sign on the door saying \"cash only\" - frustrating, but I guess it happens - go in and start to try to select flavors - 5 or 6 flavors were out .... pretty much half ... the person we were here celebrating couldn't get a treat....

When I asked the young lady in attendance what the deal was, why so many flavors were out, she said \"it's the machines, there's nothing I can do\".  I don't buy that and I won't stop by menchies again.  Poor, poor, poor"}
{"text":"Menchie's is a really fun experience. This review is actually for all the Menchies, not only the one at this location. It's really similar to Yogurtys but Menchies is more generous with their sampling with little paper cups.

There are many flavours here and they keep switching every week or so so there's always something new. Some of my fave: red velvet, original tart, green tea, mocha, peanut butter, pina colada tart, pistachio, chocolate, cookies /n cream, pomegranate tart, green apple tart, boysenberry.

They have regular flavours, no sugar added, low carb, and dairy free. Something for everyone!

I am not a big fan of the many toppings, but I always get the bubbles that look like tapioca pearls, but burst like caviar. The lychee one is the best!

Wish they had this place when I was younger - there are lots of kids there along with teenagers hanging out at night."}
{"text":"Yum!  Love this place, small family business, good people.  Tuesdays they have special $5 no matter how much fro yo you get.  I bring our kids 1-2X/week and never get sick of it."}
{"text":"Came here with a colleague as it is near work and loved it. The location is awesome and the variety of ice cream choices is awesome too.  The place is very clean and the toppings have their own little lids, which I love as it keeps everything in place.  Very clean and friendly atmosphere.  Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Best yogurt shop in Scottsdale! Fresh fruit, friendly staff and a clean store!! They have AWESOME promotions!!! They even have shakes that taste amazing! I'm here all the time, I love it!!"}
{"text":"Staff are extremely helpful and nice!  I love this location!  Just beware when it gets late and close to closing because the rowdy high school teenagers that live across the street at the apartments walk around the parking lot area causing chaos.  Last time they were racing stolen shopping carts and almost hit my brand new car."}
{"text":"Love their yogurt. They add new flavors quite often my fav is pumpkin, pb and marshmallow."}
{"text":"I came to this Menchies the other day and it was really nice.  They had a bunch of different flavours of yogurt.  The girl working in the store was also really nice.

The only flaws were a few machines did not have yogurt and a few flavours were really runny.  When I went to sample one of them it went all over my hands.  Luckily they had a tap that was accessible so I rinsed my hands.

This location has less toppings than other locations but I was really happy with my experience.  They also have a promotion where you get to fill a smaller cup as high as you want with the purchase of a hot dog (they smelled aMaZiNg).

I would definitely recommend this location if you want to satisfy your Menchie craving."}
{"text":"Excellent froyo!  The red velvet cake was spot-on and they have a great selection of toppings.  I liked that the candy toppings were in dispensers.  I've had a number of experiences where the candy is out in the open and get stale.  Unfortunately, I don't live near a Menchies but perhaps this is a good thing.  ;)"}
{"text":"Menchies is a nice place with a good selection of frozen Yogurt. My daughter loves it here. Great selection, free samples and good prices is a combo you can't go wrong with."}
{"text":"The best frozen yogurt place, hands down! They always have a variety of flavors that changes often. I personally love the sorbets! They have a great selection of toppings too. Then, when you are ready to check out, you spend a lot less than any other froyo location. At competitors you can end up paying $10 a person! At Menchies, you spend $5-$6 less! The staff has always been friendly and tolerate children well. My family and I love this place!!"}
{"text":"Best frozen yogurt I've had in a long time!! 
The toppings are amazing! The yogurt was delicious. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"This Menchie's location is awful. The employees are loud and careless. They talk with so much profanity and volume. So unnecessary to be talking so loudly in such a small space. The \"fresh\" fruit section is made up with a bunch of old, soggy fruit. The oats were stale and sticky; there were rock hard raisins that could break a tooth! The yogurt itself was edible -- average. For two small cups of frozen yogurt, it totaled $8. I guess you get what you pay for: cheap yogurt and toppings. Won't be coming back to this location again."}
{"text":"Clean and teenagers behind counter are always friendly. They constantly have new yummy flavors to try. The only downside here is that this franchise doesn't offer any checkin or yelp deals like the one on Scottsdale Rd."}
{"text":"Awesome yogurt shop!!! Wonderful flavors, awesome selection of toppings. Clean and inviting atmosphere. Sydney who works there is always so friendly and courteous to me and my family when we go there for froyo. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The cashier had no idea how to work the system. Couldn't input the coupon I had and printed the wrong receipt. When I asked for my receipt he didn't know how. A little training would go a long way."}
{"text":"After going to NailSense, my pal suggested that we go for a frozen yogurt fix. 

I've only been to the Menchie's in the Annex so I wasn't sure what to expect. It's a franchise so the layout is identical to their other store. They even have THE wall dedicated to recognizing all the celebs who eat (or pretend to eat) 'froyo' from Menchie's.

Parking - tons of it on residential streets; there's also metered parking. 

Had the cookies'n'cream with cheesecake bites. Was a tad cheesed that there weren't red velvet cake bited.... ;)

My experience was okay. At the end of the day, these frozen yogurt places all seem to be the same."}
{"text":"Wide variety of flavors, they have some new flavors that they cycle in and out that are usually really good. All their toppings are fresh and yummy. I'm a big fan of their pineapple flavor frozen yogurt. Staff is super friendly and it's located in a low key area where mainly families come. So it's a perfect place for a family to enjoy a treat together."}
{"text":"Big fan! I really enjoyed the \"spin the wheel\" Wednesdays. Looking forward to trying it out on a Tuesday though-- pack all you want in a small cup for $5!

Best flavors: Creme Brulee, Tiramisu, Java Coffee."}
{"text":"Best frozen yogurt in town! Fresh fruit, real Oreos and toppings, always clean in the store, and friendly team members! What else can you ask for??"}
{"text":"Best froyo in Scottsdale!

I like froyo, well I like gelato but I try to avoid ice cream for its fat, so froyo is good alternative for someone like me watching for weight gain.

They have great choices for frozen yogurt, I have my favorite but all of them are good. My favorite topping is mochi and pecan. Their texture is so different, I like to mix things up to enjoy different texture. 

It's always very clean inside, small eating area both inside and outdoors, enjoy your froyo while watching people.

Service is good, staff is always friendly and patient for those like to take time deciding what he/she wants.

Good place to reward myself when I did something good."}
{"text":"Menchie's has best yogurt in Scottsdale an great staff best service fun place to visit all around"}
{"text":"At this rate with a Menchie's opening up in every neighbourhood, it feels a little silly to post yet another review. Like reviewing a Starbucks, this one is 65% about the shameless FTR grab. Yeah, you know it. 

An excellent location, this Menchie's is directly across a Yoga studio and in the midst of coffee shops and bistros. Though not a single froyo shop is within walking distance. The closest one is Yogurty's located at Lawrence and Ave Rd. 

This one is infested with children and kids in high school. I don't know what it is about Menchie's but it's definitely favoured by children. They had about 10 flavours of froyo; Green Tea, Peanut Butter, Frozen Hot Chocolate and Red Velvet amongst others. I wish they'd have some unsweetened options other than the Tart flavour (my favourite). The toppings at Menchie's are better than those of many other Froyos in the city. 

I was pretty surprised to overhear a cashier mention a loyalty card, as I've been to Menchie's many times but have yet to be offered one. I'd be here again when the kids aren't everywhere."}
{"text":"Wow! What a great place for kids! We had such a great time making all our specialized concoctions... my kids beg me to take them there, and I am always happy to do so. So may combinations, and there is something for everyone. Thank you menchies!!!"}
{"text":"Went there tonight for the first time.  Great service great selection.  Friendly staff.  Can't miss toppings.  Close to my house.  This could become a habit. :-)"}
{"text":"Fun place for family with lots of flavors and toppings! My daughter loves this place. It's always clean, and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"The variety of yogurt is great, the extra toppings makes it standout. It's just what you need on a hot day to cool you down. The service is good it's a self serve place, so you choose what you want. You pay by the weight of what you put on a bowl or waffle bowl."}
{"text":"Yummy yogurt flavors & lot if toppings. The only thing missing was fresh pineapple. Great prices. Go...you'll be happy"}
{"text":"Probably the biggest franchise of froyo shops in Canada, Menchies has become my defacto choice when I'm craving some froyo. So how does this location stack up? Not great. 

I mean at the end of the day it's frozen yogurt and it's still delicious so who cares but this location should aspire to do better. Maybe it's bad luck but flavours occasionally aren't ready and just pour liquid into your cup which obviously sucks. After that they have an adequate selection of toppings, all the standards with probably a few too many gummy candies and not enough fruit, they have ~10 varieties of similar tasting gummy candy and only strawberries for fruit (or maraschino cherries if you're a weirdo who would count that). Some of the other toppings like the crispy crunch crumbs had formed into a single rock solid object that couldn't be chipped away at. 

Largely the staff has been totally fine but on our first trip a coupon we had was denied because the owner's had switched and the new one didn't honor it and on a more recent trip my girlfriend and I had managed to make it through the whole process and stood at the till for about a minute before someone finally emerged from the back, I was half-ready to just check ourselves out if no one showed up soon. 

Finally, the store isn't particularly clean, but I get it, especially since this store seems to attract more families with young children then some of the other locations. 

Overall it's fine but they could and should be doing better."}
{"text":"Awesome store! My daughter loved the yogurt and all of the toppings they have. A very fun experience for kids."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to this Menchie's location. We were excited to find it and although it wasn't a bad experience is say they had some work to do to get to a five-star experience level.  We weren't greeted upon entering even though the person working that day wasn't with another customer.  The stations were relatively clean but a few places could have used some attention.  I was disappointed by the variety of flavors.  A number of options but not much for those of us that like the basics - plain vanilla, chocolate, etc.  we were finally greeted when we arrived at the counter and although the young lady was relatively friendly she didn't have any excitement or energy to her.  The frozen yogurt itself was good and the pricing structure is what you'd expect.  Not a lot of room for eating in but that's okay too.  So it was a good experience but not a great one."}
{"text":"In the cutthroat world of the frozen yogurt industry, stores are willing to do whatever it takes to differentiate themselves from the shop around the corner. Rumors abound about sabotage abound. There's the one about \"professional samplers\" who stay in a shop for hours just sampling and never actually purchasing a cup of yogurt. Then there's the one about switching out regular chocolate chips with spicy chile chocolate chips. Whatever it may be, you've got to be careful these days about which frozen yogurt establishment to which you pledge allegiance, or you might wake up to find a cup of melted Strawberry Burst in you bed.

But seriously, Menchies is delicious. I honestly can't differentiate most of these yogurt places, but they're mostly all good. Menchies has a great selection of flavors and toppings and the stores is clean and bright and makes you want to eat frozen yogurt into the wee hours of the night. Their salted caramel is especially scrumptious and I recently enjoyed the Key Lime pie flavor."}
{"text":"Yay for frozen yogurt!  Open as of 7/22. It is located next to the Shell Superpumper gas station. Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Had a late night sweet tooth and Menchie's was where I ended up! Amazing flavored with an abundance of toppings. I will be coming to Menchies a lot more!"}
{"text":"The yogurt is great as well as the location but it would be nice if they would turn up the air conditioning because we are all sweating like pigs."}
{"text":"Good froyo with better prices than the other joints in the area. Customer service is always spot on. ****4 Stars."}
{"text":"Interesting concept. Not sure about the weight based cost but with that said, I definitely enjoyed the indulgent treat. 
I was not walked through the concept but caught on quickly. This is like a salad bar only frozen yogurt. You simply grab a cup and load it however you want. I went for peanut butter and chocolate yogurt with hot fudge and oreo cookies. It was $6.50. Not bad for a loner but I wouldn't want to pay for a birthday party of 12 year olds..."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this Frozen Yogurt shop. I give Menchies's Scottsdale Towne Center 5 stars because they deserve it! The mass amount of varieties of yogurt flavors is incredible and you are able to sample as much as you want and still get your cup of yogurt. The employees are at a constant rate of giving you your best experience you have had at a frozen yogurt shop. The promotions are awesome and the waffle bowls and shakes are even better!! The store is very sanitized and well put together. I am always leaving Menchies's with a smile and a positive attitude. Highly recommend this location to anyone looking for a good treat, a smiley staff & a good sit down with the family!"}
{"text":"I just love this frozen yogurt place. They have amazing flavors and amazing toppings. I am pet much a regular customer now, make a visit atleast once a week if not twice. 
The best its their red velvet flavored frozen yogurt which is just so super delicious.
Love it love it love it!!"}
{"text":"I love me some Menchies!  I frequent this location several times a week-and this is the BEST froyo shop in town-due to excellent customer service-it feels like a warm hug when you walk through the doors!  The owner understands that hiring wonderful employees brings loyal customers.  Great selections abound-and lest we not forget- $5 Fill Up Tuesdays!  Makes it my fave day of the week."}
{"text":"Nice yogurt place in a pretty trendy side of town. We love hanging here and people watching outside. Yogurt is delicious and a great dessert to wrap up a dinner with in a hot Scottsdale night. Nice, clean, appealing and trendy. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Overwhelming odor of disinfectant caused my SO to lose his appetite. Left feeling nauseated. I got some anyway and it tasted great, but the evening was pretty much ruined for him."}
{"text":"When I saw another yogurt shop being built here, I must admit that I had my doubts. My family had been frequent customers of another chain nearby, and before discovering Menchies, I would've said the other chain was the best. Not so. Menchies has a cheerful, welcoming atmosphere that makes the customer feel at home. They trust you to get your own samples and still buy yogurt (no limits on samples). The texture, flavor, and unique options for both yogurt and toppings make this my new favorite froyo place. 

Other locations have the same products, but I have to mention that the staff at this location is especially friendly and helpful! Whether I need assistance or not, the workers always make a point to make conversation and interact with me. Makes getting good yogurt an even better experience!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan. Guilty as charged about once a month I eat yogurt with Reese's after the gym (go figure). Nice employees and love being able to taste the yogurt first. Bring back the Cinnabon!"}
