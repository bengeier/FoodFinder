{"text":"Went there for lunch.  Had a great Gyro and a special of the day.  It was very authentic and very tasty.  Young lady at the counter was very friendly and helpful. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"The food is awesome. They used to have a fountain machine, but now just bottled soda and water. The lack of a public restroom for customers is the only reason I don't give it five stars."}
{"text":"The best gryo I've ever had!  My wife and I stopped here on a visit to Cleveland since it had been a while since we've had a gyro, and because of the decent online reviews this restaurant had. My wife got the authentic Greek gyro (with pork) and I had the American version (with lamb). This was the first time I had heard of a restaurant serving a gyro with pork, so I was very curious as to how it would taste. My taste buds were exploding with delight when I took a bite of the Greek gyro! The flavors were wonderful, and the meat was tender and juicy! The American gryo was just as delicious. Nice thick pieces of tender juicy lamb, not the thin dry slices of lamb that you get at your typical restaurant that serves gyros. Not only is the food amazing but so are the prices.  If you're in the Cleveland area and are in the mood for a gyro, I highly recommend you swing by Lakewood and give Greek Village Grille a try."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from there one day and it was fantastic. The food came in under 10 minutes which was a huge plus. The gyro itself was perfect. Nothing was too overpowering and baklava was a nice little treat at the end. Definitely will order again"}
{"text":"Great Gyros and the fries are amazing. The prices are reasonable and service was fast and efficient."}
{"text":"I have been a loyal customer to the Greek Village Grill for years. I frequently get takeout or delivery from there (at least once a month). I experienced the rudest driver tonight that I could possibly imagine. Despite ordering online and having the opportunity to add specific instructions for the delivery (I live in one of the high rises on Lake and we have a particular entrance to use for deliveries), I was called by the driver and berated for information that I had already specified. Upon delivery, not knowing that the driver was the one that called me (I assumed someone at the establishment), I told her about my experience and that I wished she convey my experience to management. She proceeded to look under the receipt and find the information that she needed to successfully deliver my order and then used the fact that it was \"under the receipt\" to defend her performance. Are you kidding me? The gyros offered here are tasty and offered at a fair price. The customer experience that I had was abysmal and is demonstrative of a downward trend that I have noticed. It's a shame. I do enjoy their gyros. Honestly, I don't even want to eat the food this driver delivered. Who knows what such an angry and incompetent person may have done to it?"}
{"text":"Quality of the gyros is fantastic.  Well seasoned, authentic, great portion.  Quality of deserts is excellent as well.  Eating in the restaurant is great.  The tables are awkward and uncomfortable but the food is worth it.  The place is small, but not crowded or cramped.  The problem comes from their delivery service.  The food arrives on time, but is usually wrong.  My company ordered several times from this restaurant, and 6 times out of ten the order was not correct.  You guys need to analyze the root cause of the problem with your delivery service on large orders, before you loose customers.    Also, thankfully, they don't ruin gyros by putting lettuce in the mix.  KEEP DOING THIS!  Lettuce on a gyro is criminal!"}
{"text":"Not what I expected to be. It was okay. DO NOT get the frappe or the fries... Too much meat on the gyros.. Overall disappointed"}
{"text":"Let's face it, this place is all about the gyros. I've tried different items on the menu, but they were so so and I wouldn't be moved to order them again. The gyros however are delicious! They shave the meat right off the skewer to order and its plentiful and juicy. This is my go to gyro spot."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a fast and delicious lunch or dinner- this is a great stop. Authentic flavor and all of the ingredients are FRESH. The American gyro and the Philly gyro are our favorites. The fries are also fresh and tasty.  For dessert- the cheesecake is so so. The baklava is outstanding.  Large portions but worth being stuffed!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent gyro, the American, tastes just as a gyro should. Tomato, red onion and better than good tzatziki sauce over so much meat that I had a nice portion for dessert from what had fallen off. The fries didn't disappoint either, plentiful, hot, and perfect w vinegar! This place will be a future stop for sure."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best gyros in Lakewood!!"}
{"text":"The 5 stars is for the food. Best Gyro I have had ever. The owner or cook or whatever needs to lose the female groupie hanger on. The intimate conversation between the two across the counter makes the customer feel as though they are intruding on something private. Not a comfortable feeling when the groupie keeps giving you looks like \"hurry up and order your food and get the hell out\""}
{"text":"Dried out meat and limp soggy fries. Tommy should have stuck with his Lakewood location. He's spreading himself way too thin opening up restaurant after restaurant without knowing how to maintain quality control."}
{"text":"My friends and I love the Greek Village Grill.  I used to live in Lakewood near their original location, which is a little cramped for space but the food is always excellent. The new restaurant here in Broadview Heights is just one notch better. Much more spacious and brighter than the original location and the food is just as fantastic. I went out of my way for lunch to stop and check it out.  The staff was very friendly, and my gyro was overflowing with delicious ingredients while also wrapped tightly to hold it all together. The fries were hot and crispy but could have used a touch more seasoning (I will remember to ask for extra seasoning next time around). My food came out within 5 minutes during a Thursday lunch around noon with several other people in the restaurant, but all the food was made to order, hot, and fresh.  I am a frequent customer of Greek Village Grill for a reason. I will certainly be returning to this location again. The new formal dining restaurant they attached next door will be next on my list of visits."}
{"text":"Finally!! Yummy, authentic Greek food outside of a festival. I admit that I only had the Greek gyro, but the pork was juicy and seasoned well. The meat and pita were grilled in front of me, and everything was served hot. My family had some of the other  more traditional dishes and enjoyed them as well. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for carry out after getting a haircut on the west side. (Yes, I did remember my passport).  I was very impressed with the chicken and pork souvlaki platters -- perfectly cooked and nicely seasoned, served with a fluffly rice pilaf, very ripe tomato slices and tzatziki and pita. Everything was great -- the pita tasted homemade, the greek salad was very fresh and loaded with quality feta.  Unfortunately the  tzatziki tasted like it had sour cream or mayo  rather than yogurt in it -- neither of which I eat. Also,next time I would order the same thing minus the huge clump of raw onions in each container which smelled my car.   Cute hole-in-the-wall atmosphere with Greek decor, although I don't think I'd ever actually stay to eat -- it was super sweaty warm inside w/ open grill smell permeating the air. Big boon: they have Greek Mythos beer which goes perfectly w/ Greek food.  Now, will they please open a branch on the east side?"}
{"text":"The first several times I ate here was after a night of drinking, and let's be honest, almost everything tastes better after you've been out drinking all night. They are open until 4 AM on Friday & Saturday night, so there is usually at least a handful of people in there shortly after last call. Upon visiting for dinner, and completely sober may I add, I can say this is not just a late night spot to fill your belly before you slip into your alcohol induce slumber.  This is essentially a take out place so I won't hold it against them that they only have 3 (possibly 4) bar height tables with 2 bar height chairs per table. They are basically there so you have somewhere to sit while you wait for your order, not necessarily so that you can eat-in.  The menus is rather diverse. You have your choice of gyro style: 1.) regular (tomato, onion & tzatziki sauce OR 2.) dirty (onion, yellow mustard & fries). I'll admit I've never been adventurous enough to try the dirty option. They offer your classic lamb/beef as well as marinated pork, marinated chicken, marinated charcoal-grilled pork, marinated charcoal-grilled chicken, Greek seasoned country pork sausage, ground beef & a vegetarian option. As you can see your options are plentiful. They also offer a jumbo gyro which is double the meat, but trust me you don't need it unless you haven't eaten for days. They also have something called the Mount Olympus, which is described as \"The Ultimate Gyro\" & will run you $20. It frightens me to imagine the immensity of this beast of a gyro. They also offer a wide selection of hummus, dips, salads, entrees/platters, side dishes & desserts. The only dish other than their gyros that I can vouch for are their dolmades (seasoned rice wrapped in grape leaves), and they are delicious.   The prices are very reasonable, $5 for any style/choice of meat gyro. The portions are huge, several pieces of meat always sneak out of my pita & onto my plate. The quality of the food is excellent & the service is ultra quick."}
{"text":"hidden gem! one of few greek places on westside. great to hear staff chatting in greek. moussaka and pastitsio are great."}
{"text":"Gyro was dry. Ordered a large fry and got 10 fries. Very disappointed. Waited 15 minutes and no one was in there. Will not return."}
{"text":"Always fast and friendly.  I love the pork or chicken gyros.  Stuffed grape leaves are also great. Can also get side of gyro meat."}
{"text":"Phone service was horrible and rude. Delivery is awful with long waits from what was said to be delivered...but food was good. But after three times of awful customer service we are done, food isn't good enough to deal with it."}
{"text":"This place makes an awesome gyro. We always do takeout, but they have an eat-in dining room as well. Everything is make to order, so expect to wait about 5 minutes for your food. I always get the American gyro and my husband gets stuffed grapes leaves. Everything has always been great!"}
{"text":"Not sure what the deal is lately. If I come in the afternoon for lunch, I get a great gyro, done in reasonable time, with decent service. Anytime in the evening, it's just shit. Lazy, cold, way too many onions, onions that don't have the yellow core removed, people bitching at each other behind the counter, and shit attitudes."}
{"text":"Love this place the Greek fries are seasoned to perfection the gyros are awesome it's a must try in Lakewood"}
{"text":"Just pure Disgusting is all I can say about my visit today. I came in here a few months ago but since the didn't have falafel I never really came in but yesterday I wanted to try something different and this was not a bad choice seeing the blonde haired lady was rude and had a nasty attitude about me asking questions about the food. I brushed it off and since the food wasn't bad I let it slide but today I go in and the red hair chick is there and before I came in I called and  tells me a customer that she has no manager in the store (of course my mouth hit the floor) so I said I'll just walk down there I get in and  there is a guy who looked like a regular customer sitting there. So I asked for a manager again and the same red hair chick tell me she's the only one running the store so I yet again brushed it off and placed my order and when I did the customer or who I thought was a customer got up to go make my food. He never washed his hands or put gloves on and when he touched my pita with his bear hands I said no this is not gonna work I want a refund and she look at me like I didn't something wrong. She gave me 8 dollars back when my order came up to 6 dollars but she had a stank attitude she wasn't paying attention or she just can't count idk because there was no manager to speak with. From what I witnessed today this place should be shut down or have all new workers. The food wasn't bad but the service was absolutely horrible I will make sure myself or my customers NEVER come there again."}
{"text":"Lets just say I immediately called my doctor after eating a gyro from here. Got delivery and the Gyro was very close to falling out of the bag due to all the grease that had leaked through the bag. I was disgusted, and quite honestly, apologetic to my arteries. Sorry Greek Village Grille, I'll stick to waiting for my girlfriends family's greek cooking.  is there a, \"good for: high cholesterol\" box I can check?"}
{"text":"I don't go here anymore much. Not as muchmeat onsandwiches as they used to put. They had an onion problem which seemed to be fixed on my last visit. The onions were drying out from the grill heat, wilting quite badly & they still used them. Why I stopped going. Went backto see not as much meat on the sandwiches now. Too bad, I really liked some of the special gryos they make. But for $8 each meat it up Village!!"}
{"text":"I am not a happy person. We waited for an hour and 30 minutes for our food to be delivered for almost none of our food to actually be correct. I asked for a rootbeer and they gave me a coke. I expected hot food and I received COLD food. My pita wasn't grilled. All of it was cold and soggy. NOT PLEASED. I asked for ketchup and didn't receive it. I paid extra for cucumber and they didnt give me any. I wouldn't even eat it because it was so soggy. I am not one who is super picky about their food, but I will not be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Everything says open till 3am. Showed up at 1:37am on a Saturday. With doors open was told they were closed. No one was drinking, or happened to even closely looking \"drunk\". Was blatantly denied service. Will be following up with management, but from the looks of the filthy workers, they did us a favor. Went to Angelos, and was treated with utmost respect. I WILL spend a lot of time doing all I can to make sure no one else deals with this type of awful, awful service. Don't wast your time, go some where your welcome."}
{"text":"I got take-out from here this past weekend, and was not impressed.  The first three things I tried to order were met with \"we discontinued that.\"  Ugh.  They desperately need to update the online menu.  They did give us a paper menu with several items blacked out when we picked up our food, but that won't help much since I don't plan on returning.  They messed up our order, forgetting items and not following directions to omit ingredients.  The food was forgettable.  I would have given it 3 stars for food taste/quality.    The prices are high for what you get."}
{"text":"amazing food and environment. the amount and quality of food and meat you get is unmatched. feel like i'm really in greece when i'm eating there."}
{"text":"I almost want to try every gyro place just to prove that Greek Village is the best. I can't explain in words how amazing I find this place. I love the american gyro, the roasted red pepper hummus and the feta fries! I always recommend this place to anyone who wants a gyro in Cleveland.   The extra plus side to this place is that they deliver!!"}
{"text":"Seriously???? Four dollars to deliver cold food to my house? Four dollars that doesn't go to the driver but four dollars that goes to the restaurant. How obscene is that?"}
{"text":"The Greek Village is a great place for food. I love the gyro bites their perfect with a side salad for lunch. The service is fast and friendly it's not easy making a decision on a meal because everything is so delicious."}
{"text":"Have been here twice now.  First time was rock solid, most recent time was incredibly \"Meh\".  My wife and I shared a gyro sandwich platter, which came with all the fixings...but the tzatziki sauce had no kick to it (tasted more like yogurt or sour cream).  We also ordered a side of small spinach pie appetizers and they too were not very memorable.  I am a lover of Greek food, and Cleveland is a city that is sorely lacking in that department.  Unfortunately (with our last experience here), I doubt I'll be running back there anytime soon."}
{"text":"Best gyros I've had around town! Seriously though, they are delicious and huge. About $7 a pop too which is reasonable. I also recommend the feta fries.   Great after bar meal if you are at one of the neighborhood bars (Richland, McGinty's, LVT, etc..) Just make sure to brush the inevitable onion stank off your teeth if you plan on getting lucky."}
{"text":"So I was in class, starving to death and imagining all the different delicious foods I could possibly eat. I remembered the Greek village Grill around the corner from my house and decided to give it a shot as I am huge fan of gyro! and what can I say...it was incredible. I had the Greek Gyro combo and a baklava for desert.   It was a piece of heaven. The meat was deliciously seasoned, the tzaziki (sp) was not too garlicky and the pita was great as well. i could have done without the fries but that might have just been because by the time I got home they were soggy. The baklava was great too and I will pay for it tomorrow at the gym!   i will be back...100% and try some of the other items as well!"}
{"text":"Probably the best, most authentic Greek restaurant I've found in the Cleveland area! The portions are massive, the fries are some of the best I've ever had, and the lamb gyro is AMAZING! The atmosphere of the restaurant was wonderful, and the staff were friendly as well. Perfect experience, albeit a bit messy! ;-)"}
{"text":"Chicken Gyro can be dry and overcooked.   Mousakka and Pastitsio are very good.   Staff is friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I was in my car pondering lunch when I found myself at Broadview and Rte 82, so I turned in and went to Greek Village. I've been to the sit-down side, the Ouzeria, this time I went to the carryout side, Greek Village Grill. I ordered one of their ample selection of pita sandwiches, which are offered as gyro or souvlaki sandwiches of chicken or pork. The gyros/sandwiches are all $8. I also purchased a bakery dessert and a drink; total was $13.50. A little more than I like to pay for lunch,  but there was a dessert which is not something I would usually get but it looked really good.  I ordered to go and ate the chicken souvlaki sandwich in my car. I was surprised to find fries wrapped in as part of the sandwich. I ate those first; they were pretty good with the tzatziki sauce. The sandwich was very tasty, seasoned chicken, tomato, onions,  and the sauce. The Flatbread was soft, fresh and warm.    Although the flavor was great, really great, I didn't like the potatoes wrapped in and also, this sandwich is best eaten outside and wearing a garbage bag with head and armholes cut out. All in all, tasty, very messy, and at $8 a little more than I want to spend for a gyro. The semolina cake is soaked in lemon flavored syrup and is delicious. I'll probably be back because everything tasted great."}
{"text":"I used to really enjoy this place until they started charging me almost $7 for a pita, lettuce, cucumber, and sauce. How about create a vegetarian sandwich that's reasonably priced?!    Also, the delivery drivers will make up hours every other time you call in case they are feeling lazy and don't want to take out an order."}
{"text":"Our last visit tonight was very disappointing and we won't be back.  Gyro meat was hard and dry on the edges.  Overall, sandwich tasted \"off\".  Dolmathes were served cold, and were slimy and swimming in oil.  No tyropita, though it's on the menu.  No desserts.  Counterperson seemed bored and disengaged and was watching \"Cops\", which blared in the dining room.  Tiny, thin, useless napkins and a general impression of trying to cut corners.  Next time we'll go to Niko's."}
{"text":"I tried the gyro quesadilla and was blown away. Not only is the food good but the customer service is excellent. Thanks guys for the great service and excellent food I will be seeing you guys real soon."}
{"text":"The restaurant itself is small yet very clean. I've had food from here before and it was good, and this second visit was even better.    I got my order for takeout and had my food in less than 3 minutes and it was super affordable.   I got the American Gyro on a wheat pita and the spinach artichoke dip with warm pita wedges.  Both dishes were very hot and fresh.   I'll start with the spinach artichoke dip and pita wedges. You get a generous serving of the dip with warm pita pieces. I found it very hard to stop eating the wedges on the way home they were that good. The dip was delectably salty like a good spinach artichoke dip should be. I wanted to eat it with a spoon.   The American Gyro has the traditional beef/lamb mix, a sauce and topped with onions and tomatoes. There was a generous portion of gyro meat and plenty of that sauce. It was absolutely delicious.   I saw that this establishment is open until 3am on Saturdays which I am sure they make a killing on these days because these gyros would be the perfect ending to a night at the bar.   I can't wait to return again."}
{"text":"This is one of my go-to places in Lakewood for take-out. I've made my way through a lot of their menu and haven't had any complaints. I'm guessing most people do the gyros, and they're pretty solid and well priced.   My current favorite is the Olympus platter. The half-size is enough for two meals and has allll sorts of magic happening in the dish.   I see a lot of people complaining about the service -- not sure what that's about. This is a no-frills shop whose focus is the food. Don't want to wait an hour for delivery? Pick it up.   We had one mishap with a pick-up order and they left off a dish. When I called back, they knew who I was immediately and delivered the remaining dish to my apartment so quickly the food was still hot."}
{"text":"So 7$ for a gyro? I got it to go I should of opened the bag while I was there,it was the size of a kids burrito. No value here, your better off getting a burrito from chipotle that dwarfs the size and get your money worth."}
{"text":"We've ordered delivery from Greek Village twice this week, and I have to say we're very impressed.  Cheap (and huge!) Gyros, delicious Dolmades, super fast delivery, and they're open late - all great, in my book.  I hope they stick around, because we love 'em!"}
{"text":"I have to say I'm a bit disappointed in this restaurant. I came in tonight excited for a little Greek experience. I ordered a jumbo gyro which was alright. I also ordered a large Greek salad which was overpriced for the portion size. I ordered a large order of fries which were subpar. The last item I ordered was pastitsio, which was burnt on the bottom and tasted like it had been sitting under a heat lamp.   I would like to stress that the portion sizes are overpriced in my opinion.   Overall I was not to happy with my experience and most likely will not return."}
{"text":"This place used to be a great place to take away gyros but now it's totally trashy establishment with very nasty and rude staff that fight with each other and with customers.. they no longer take pride in their food and the appearance of their business."}
{"text":"Talk about amazing cheap eats!  If you like Greek food, you WILL love this place.  Generous portions.  I went there for lunch today.  Had the Gyro with lamb (as good as it gets) for $4!!  I tried the hummus - all I can say is WOW!!  Also had a huge tray of their FRESH CUT fries for $1.50 (also very good)!!  For dessert, a chocolate covered baklava (made by the owners mom) - yummy!!  Friday, Saturday - they are open until 4am - forget the late night pizza, get a gyro!!"}
{"text":"Great gyro when you are getting carry out.  Definitely get the jumbo with an extra pita."}
{"text":"Just a heads up! Ordered delivery one time in the evening and it was delivered professionally. The food was perfect. The menu and website state that they deliver until 3am on Saturdays. I called around 2am and was told that they are done delivering for the evening. This was extremely disappointing, especially considering that the restaurant is situated in a town lousy with bars. Unfortunately, we had to order our dinner from Nunzio's this night. Can't wait to order their food again at lunch time or early supper when it's convenient for them."}
{"text":"Came here again today- this time to get take out.  I ordered the same dishes that I did last time, though not necessarily by choice because, once again, the Mousaka was not available and only the vegetarian version was.  Is it that this dish is extremely popular that it does not seem to be ever available?  There were no other customers in the restaurant at the time.  In any case, we remembered that we were ok w/ the vegetarian version of the Mousaka last time so we ordered it again, as well as the Greek Gyro combo and dolmades.  The dishes were waiting for me when I arrived.  I ordered the Greek Gyro again because I wondered if last time the dryness of the meat was just bad luck.  It wasn't- it was dry again this time.  I wonder if the American gyro meat is just more forgiving because it is more processed.  If I ever come back, I think that I'll order that.  The gyro was heavy on the raw onion- I had to remove most of it to make the sandwich edible.  The fries that I got were soggy, though well flavored.  The trip back to my home is all of less than 2 minutes, so I don't think it was just that it got cold.  My wife says that they are not double fried, which is what gives fries the crispy exterior.  My 8 month old did enjoy them, however, so that was a plus.  The mousaka was ok.  I don't think that I'll ever order it again- it could have been more strongly spiced.  Really wish they had the non-vegetarian version.  Probably the highlight of the visit was the tasty lemon flavored potatoes that came with it, although the Yelp menu seems to indicate that you get a side salad and pita wedges, along with your choice of sides.  This is not the case and the combo that we got was disappointing for $12, especially since we really had wanted the non-vegetarian version.  Dolmades are one of our favorite Mediterranean side dishes- at their best they are wonderfully tender stuffed grape leaves with delicious mix of rice and onions, oftentimes with some ground meat mixed in.  We love them and order them whenever we get the chance.  These dolmades were a real disappointment- soggy and falling apart once we picked them out of the package, the rice interior was like mush, not at all like the tender interior with a little bit of chew to it that we are used to getting.  Usually me and The Wife are scrapping to get the last one but we ended up leaving 3 lonely dolmades for leftovers.  It pains me a bit to write this, because I really want this restaurant to do well and I rarely leave bad reviews- I'm a bit of a Broadview Heights cheerleader, but I'm not sure if I'll ever come back to this place, even though I really do love gyros.  Maybe I'm an American gyro person- I'm not sure."}
{"text":"Um...nah...not impressed.  I ordered the Chicken Souvlaki and some almond cookies.  I took a bite of of the chicken and I don't know what type of seasoning that was combined and used when cooking the chicken it made me gag.  It was too much going on, I couldn't even force myself to eat.  It left a bad taste in my mouth the whole day even after I brushed my teeth and tongue and used listerine!  The cookies were horrible too...only took one bite and threw everything away."}
{"text":"This place is very disappointing lately. The feta fries are seriously a joke now, barley any cheese, it was also unmelted shredded cheddar...wtf happened to provolone and feta? Like it's called feta fried and you served me fried with in melted cheddar cheese and tomatoes.  Also if you're closed, maybe tell Grub hub and other delivery services, just a tip. It's says they're open when they're not."}
{"text":"Tasty and affordable. Not the best Greek ever but it's also not expensive so you get a good meal for the price. Honestly, huge portions. Bigger than necessary but I'm fine with that. Very nice employees and a very small place so i always get carry out but if you're nearby, it's a good place for a meal."}
{"text":"Every time I've gotten takeout here, I've been pleased. Food is cooked in front of you. Extremely casual. Delicious pitas. I've had gyros here, but my favorite is the Athenian Platter. So good."}
{"text":"Everything I've had from here is absolutely phenomenal... and they deliver!  Open late for after-the-bar or mid-party munchies, this is one of my perennial favorites.  I live in Cuyahoga Falls now, and I still travel the 45 minutes or so just to eat their delicious food!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great gyros, and not a budget buster. If you're in the mood for a gyro they got you covered. Beware the onion. You'll be noticeably stinky well into the night after one of these. But that's the price you pay."}
{"text":"I will never eat here again. They have consistently messed up my orders over the past year, sending the meat dishes instead of the vegetarian ones, as well as the wrong salads, and forgetting to put feta in the spanakopita. They are terribly over priced for the amount and quality of food you get.  After calling an complaining, asking for my money back, they continually wanted to send a new order to me. Even when I drove the food back personally, the cook still wanted to make a new dish. Sorry, but no thank you.  It's disappointing because this place was so good a few years ago."}
{"text":"Damn good gyros esp. the gyro burrito. $8 for burrito that makes Chipotle look like dog food. Always delicious and authentic."}
{"text":"So I'm not too familiar with gyros as this was my first one but I'm so glad this was my first one! Greek Village Grille reminds me of a Mr. Hero setup. I like how they don't serve just regular gyros. You can get a gyro bowl, burrito or quesadilla. I opted for the chicken quesadilla but your other options can be a mix of beef and lamb or pork. Because lamb can be a bit gamey, I picked the chicken and it did not disappoint. The sauces on the side add a nice touch. The sauces included their tzatziki sauce and this orange sauce that had like a Cajun feel to it. Both were amazing. My meal wasn't spicy however I highly recommend using the tzatziki sauce if you ordered something spicy. Although they only offer bottled beverages I bought 2 bottled beverages for $3.50 which is very reasonable. Although my quesadilla was $10 I was stuffed when I was through. It was a very laid back place with friendly staff. Highly recommend if you want something quick to go or have time to sit down and eat!"}
{"text":"Ok. 5 stars for sure. This place is great, authentic Greek food. LOVE! Mostly order takeout which is relatively fast. It is fun to go in from time to time and few like you are in a little cafe in Greece."}
{"text":"Absolute quickest delivery in lakewood! They always say 30 to 45 minutes but it's always like 15 to 20. I've had almost everything but i love the hummus, athenian platter, the fries, the village salad, Greek green beans just to name a few... and tonight i asked the girl to pick me a bottle of red wine and it went perfectly with my dinner.. Thanks guys! Please keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Delicious food.  Wonderful salad, wonderful veggie sandwich.  My husband's pork gyro was amazing too.  Lucky to have them in the hood."}
{"text":"Decided to try again just in case.. BIG MISTAKE!  Walked in to a dark and cold place..  Ordered  2 American gyros  and a salad.. $19.50 for rock hard meat gyros and plastic tasting tomatoes in the salad..All while listening to the crew trash talk a woman in the dining room, calling her a b*tch etc. ( the fact that people  are actually sitting in this  dump is a shock).NEVER AGAIN! FOOD IS ABSOLUTE GARBAGE. I would normally return this crap, but actually afraid of the big guy behind  the counter getting his \"Cops\" marathon  on the t.v.. WTF"}
{"text":"Stopped for the first time for lunch today. It is not a very large place, and appears more to be for take out rather than eat in.  Tried the American gyro. It was good, but a little greasy and messy. However, it had great flavor and a generous portion of meat.  Also tried a pork souvlaki stick. It was served with a lemon wedge. It was moist and had a nice flavor.   The person I was with tried the Chicken Soulvaki. They enjoyed it, but found it rather awkward trying to get the chicken off the skewer for the sandwich.   The place had a steady stream of people while I was there. The prices were reasonable.  From 11am to 3pm, the regular size gyro is a dollar off.  I would go back again.  Don't forget the napkins!"}
{"text":"Update...after initial contact and NUMEROUS emails to the business...owner has still not kept his word. Spoke to some friends in Medina (their newest location) and they tried it once...same service, product and pricing issues!   I renew my suggestion...RUN AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!  There are many authentic Greek restaurants and even more Gyros available that are not only better priced, but made with attention to details and respect for the customer!"}
{"text":"I had a gyro and an order of spanakopita. The gyro was quite good.  The meat was VERY generous and shaved fresh right off the rotating spit. It could have used a few more tomatoes, but was still very good.   The spanakopita were awesome!!! Just two dollars for 7 or 8 triangles. They were very fresh, crisp and yummy! Total meal $6.50. I will be back and will try one of their delicious looking dips!"}
{"text":"Boy this place used to. Be so amazing. Really has become mediocre. Salad is descent but not for $8 and then add Gyro meat.. Small portion and Semi dry and average flavor. Ordered grape leaves asked if there was Tzatziki in the bag.Of course that was missing too. We need a better place in Lakewood or the owner needs to care... ugh"}
{"text":"Well well well...1st of all,  I'm visiting from Texas so I've never been here before. We were wanting delivery from somewhere unique. I chose this place because it had 4 stars and good reviews. Well I ordered at 9:08pm on the PayPal app. And they didn't deliver until 11:30pm. I had called numerous times throughout asking for the status of the order and they just kept saying it was on the way and it was just a busy night.  I'm not sure how busy Monday nights can be... when we got the order,  the order was incorrect. I had ordered 2 \"Arizona\" drinks and 1 pepsi- we received 3 coca colas. I had also ordered a side salad with ranch and received tomato, feta cheese, and cucumbers with some yellow sauce. My plate was ok tasting,  it wasn't really amazing. But I give this review an extra star because the side potatoes were delicious and my food was still warm despite them taking 2.5 hours to deliver.  My boyfriend gyro was made \"dirty\" which just had a bunch of fries added inside it, looked like more fries than meat.  I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone visiting Cleveland."}
{"text":"This place is always fresh, great food & friendly! Never any issues!  Will always recommend!"}
{"text":"Authentic Greek pork gyro is a must try.  Friendly staff and great food at good prices"}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait more then the estimated delivery time. I do like this place and have been a customer for years but delivery sometimes is a problem and can get frustrating."}
{"text":"Tommy, if you are the heavily tattooed guy, then you were there.   And yes there was lettuce. But the lettuce was not chopped and ready to make salads.  The girl behind the register was very apologetic for not being able to get the salad out quickly.  I was done with my gyro and souvlaki sticks and ready to leave when the salad came out.  Equally so she was apologizing to all the customers for the delay in getting food out.   I am a bit of a regular and I am glad you have this place because I love Greek food.  But do not imply I am lying about my experience.   Take responsibility and honor your customers or your investment of time and money in your dream will be for naught."}
{"text":"I've used to go to this restaurant 3 times a week when I went to Lakewood High and order either the mykonos, the village, or the....(the one with mustard and fries) gyros. They do gyros right and unique. From chicken to pork to the american with beef and lamb and on top of that 10+ specialty gyros as well. Oh and you can also get a WHEAT pita, yes a WHEAT PITA. They're french fries are amazing, although I recommend to eat them at the restaurant because they can get soggy when they get wrapped to go, tasty salt and oregano fries. The Hummus and Roasted Red Pepper Hummus is amazing, so delicious. The baklava is their 2nd best item, you can tell if it's good baklava if they took the time to fill each layer inbetween instead of doing what most people do and just put the sheets together and fill one layer.  Atmosphere, very Mediterranean Greek with the white and blue like the flag, very beautiful music generally playing and of course they had the world cup soccer games playing on the TV when I was there a few days ago. The staff are very friendly and do a great job always whenever I get an order.    Although I haven't gone here that much being on a workout diet, I still get the hummus with wheat pita every now and then and the village salad with american meat. I've probably spent well over 500 dollars together eating there, I haven't had one issue there ever."}
{"text":"I spent the better part of a month in this neighborhood, and ended up stopping at Greek Village Grill a couple of times.  It didn't wow me, but if you're in the mood for Greek food, it gets the job done.  The restaurant is very clean, and everything is made-to-order, which is really nice.  I tried both regular gyro and the chicken souvlaki.  The meat was fine for both sandwiches, although I preferred the chicken.  In the souvlaki, the chicken itself was delicious, but it had so much sauce the pita disintegrated almost immediately.  I'd order it again, but with the sauce on the side perhaps.  The fries were flavored well, but not quite crispy enough for my taste.  It's a little bit expensive for an every-day lunch, but on the other hand, the portion sizes are large, so you get your money's worth.  Three stars for \"A-OK\" sounds about right.  I wouldn't go out of my way for a meal here, but I'd happily stop by if I was in the area."}
{"text":"As far as gyros go it was on par with any others I've had. Its nice they stay up late since its right next to The Richland, which doesn't serve food."}
{"text":"best greek food place in Lakewood.  Not one ounce of food left as it was just delectable.  when you think of greek, you come here for a mouth watering experience."}
{"text":"2 stars because I've had the food and it was good from what I remember. The problem is, when I called tonight and tried to order specific things off the menu, the girl on the phone was confused by me asking for a Greek Gyro and and American gyro even though they are both on the menu. I proceeded to then order three separate side dishes and they were out of all three side dishes I requested. Not sure how you can have a restaurant and not stock the main food items, especially during the dinner hour?  All I wanted was three gyros and some sides and all I got was attitude by the girl taking my order. Maybe next time will be better."}
{"text":"The gyros here are good. I would recommend not to buy the gyro balls because those aren't very good! I usually buy my gyros from here around 2 am after a good night out. The best part about this place is decent food that will deliver to your house...hard to find places like that!"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout from here for the first time. Got a lamb gyro, and a Greek salad. Salad was delicious as was the gyro. The gyro was small but still yummy. They charge 2.00 delivery fee. I will probably just eat at the restaurant next time and not do delivery. But all in all the food was very good."}
{"text":"I swear I was going to take a picture of my food... Apparently it was one of those types of food that once you take a bite you can't stop. I found out the hard way. I wanted to so many times to stop and take a picture and post it on Instagram and my snapchat story but I couldn't pull myself away from the gyro and the spinach feta dip. I had to keep going. Paranoia started kicking in halfway through. Everyone around me wanted to take my food away from me. My precious. They can't have my precious! I must keep eating! Eat it all before they take it away!! IT IS MINE!!! NOBODY CAN HAVE MY PRECIOUS!!!!!     Sorry. It happened again, and I wasn't even eating it..... Yes... That good..."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and good pricing. Pleasant people offering solid, friendly service. They even sell meat etc. to go. That helps people like me who live 40 minutes away."}
{"text":"I had a gyro at this place and that night and for the rest of the next day I was so sick!  I should have guessed something was wrong when my gyro wasn't slices of lamb like i'm used to at normal Gyro locations.  This place served some kind of ground up meat.  It didn't taste bad but something was certainly wrong!  Never again."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall gyro place. I've never seen this many versions of a gyro. At least 15 with just one type of meat. Of which they have at least 3. If you enjoy variety. This is your place. Genuine Greek music playing on full blast. Bathroom must be in the back. Good food. Good prices."}
{"text":"Let's just say we will go back! We were craving Greek food so we went. Gyro was good, salad was a Greek salad can't goof that up. The Greek fries were great and the best was the Pastitsio. Oh, the feta saganaki was very good."}
{"text":"We went here for a take-out feast of Greek food. The two young ladies taking orders and working the cash register were very friendly and helpful which is always great to encounter. The prices however, I think are a little bit high and I really disagree with charging extra for lettuce on a gyro when all you want to do is substitute it for the tomatoes. Now on to the food:  American Gyro - It was okay, the meat was a little too salty for my taste.  *Spinach Artichoke Feta Dip with Fried Pita Chips - Amazing! The kind of stuff you know is clogging your arteries but you don't care.  Dolmades - Stuffed grape leaves were okay.  Spanakopita - Spinach and cheese were okay.  Fries - Normal. *Small Greek Salad - Nice and tasty. Perfect addition to all the meat entrees.  *Souvlaki Platter - Get the pork, very good on pita with some onion and tzatziki sauce. *Roasted Red Pepper Hummus - Very tasty! Baklava - Had an odd taste of cinnamon or something to it.  Galaktobouriko - Cold and syrupy, but a strange dessert I could not stop eating.   All in all, it was a nice sampling of Greek food, and I would go back for a couple dishes like the Spinach Dip and the Souvlaki Platter. Mmm!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great atmosphere and food. We go back time and again. I know Greek food because I'm greek! The service is wonderful, definitely don't hesitate to come"}
{"text":"It's been a very busy week for me, so I've been trying a whole bunch of different cuisines/ takeout/ delivery places that I haven't had a chance to try since I've moved to Lakewood. I have absolutely been craving Greek food for weeks, and this place is delicious!! I ordered the Athenian Platter with the chicken souvlaki as well as a small Greek salad. Both were very delicious and had the right amount of seasonings and love put into them. (:   I ordered it on the way home from the gym, and they were at my house with my dinner by the time I got home from Rocky River (so fast!!!!!) The woman who delivered it was very friendly, and I will definitely be ordering from them again!!! Thank you for feeding me tonight! :D"}
{"text":"Had a gyro and fries for lunch today, and they were so delicious and fresh-tasting. This place has awesome Greek food, large portions, fair prices, and really friendly staff.  It's a gem!  If you want to eat in there are about 3-4 small tables, but it's mostly for take-out I think."}
{"text":"Terrible. Don't waste your money. The meat in our gyro's were bone dry and overcooked. Two of our dips were spoiled as well as the orzo side dish.  We later called 3 times asking to speak to a manager and never received a call until 2 weeks later.  The manager was rude & unapologetic. Very disappointed.  Will never go back.  If you're in the area craving Greek food, drive 3 miles down RT 82 to Dolma."}
{"text":"It's like a tale of two restaurants. (With apologies to Charles Dickens). Our first visit there several months ago was good. This last visit did not reach the level of ever returning to this place. My companion and I went in for a quick dinner bite. Ordered Greek salad with gyro meat topping and the baked feta cheese with pita bread. Where do I start. Absolutely no hospitality- no greeting, smiles, even an \"f\" you would have been better than the complete lack of acknowledgement we were in their restaurant. We noticed the cook didn't slice off fresh gyro meat for our order but our salads came with dried-up gyro meat that you would have to assume was cut much earlier. The baked feta was not hot and dry as we'll. we felt like we were eating leftovers. Took our money and said nothing at the conclusion of our meal. Would I go back? All I can say is \"Never on a Sunday-or Monday, or Tuesday or Wednesday or Thursday or Friday or Saturday!"}
{"text":"I was introduced to this place by my fiance as a late night food place for us to hit up after a night out.  His only complaint is that the food can be very salty.  I have been here a handful of times now and mostly for a take home dinner option during the week.  I always get a chicken gyro and hummus...never been disappointed.  Both are awesome.  My fiance typically gets a platter of some sort...TONS of food on it!  Excited to hear the owner is opening a spot downtown on West 9th Street.  Only draw back, sometimes parking can be a pain depending on the time you go there."}
{"text":"Beware!!  The Village has fine food and they're very friendly, but their hours and posted delivery times that they advertise to their website are not consistent with how the business is run. You may call at 10pm on Saturday and they're closed, or midnight on Friday and they quit delivering, etc. It's frustrating and bad business."}
{"text":"I'm beyond perplexed. I was placing an order for their regular American gyro and said \"I'll have it with lettuce, tomato, tzatziki sauce, no onion\". To which the girl behind the counter said, ok that will be extra. I said what will be extra? She said, the lettuce. Ummm, what? Isn't lettuce a given? That's like going to Subway or Jimmy John's or Dave's Cosmic Subs and them charging you extra, for LETTUCE. So, for $7.00 you get pita and meat. I was so annoyed by what had just happened, I walked out, gyro-less. Not because of the $0.50 extra cents for the lettuce (probably another $.50 for the tomatoes and another $.50 for the tzatziki sauce... I couldn't get past the ridiculousness of the lettuce charge to find out...), and went to Subway. I can see extra for out-of-the-box add on's like cheese, olives, mushrooms....but LETTUCE?! Poorly run business. Oh and by the way, there wasn't another soul in the place... probably because they charge $0.50 for lettuce."}
{"text":"Delicious spinach dip, vegetarian moussaka... Small place no frills or alcoholic beverages.  Would eat there again perfect for take out."}
{"text":"Super rad.  Speedy delivery, cheap, friendly service, and awesome food.  Everything I ever wanted in a greasy gyro place."}
{"text":"They have really gone downhill lately. We used to order from this place once a month, but lately the food quality has gotten so bad. My husband and I order spanakopita, American and chicken gyros. The meat in both gyros are very dry, especially the chicken. The spanakopita is the biggest disappointment because it used to be so good, but the past few times we've ordered it, it's either burnt or or soggy. This past weekend we gave this place one last shot and it ended up being terrible again. Dry meat as usual and the spanakopita was so terrible, it looked and tasted like it was sitting out for days. The dough was very thin and stale tasting and the filling tasted overly sour. I had to throw it away! Unfortunately, that is the last time we'll be ordering from them."}
{"text":"hands down the best gyro spot in ohio. LOVED ITT!!!! so happy this place is right down the street from where i live :)"}
{"text":"Both orders were made incorrectly. Bartender never bartender before. Horrible service and sub par food"}
{"text":"When hungry for a greek treat, go Greek Village Grille! Can't go wrong with this place as far as food is concerned. I drive by this place almost daily and wonder everyday, how the food was here. So today on my day off, I decided I give it a go. So I ordered that Gyro with lamb and beef. And to say the least, it was delicious. I wish they had more seating and more than just bar stool height tables and chairs. That's why it gets four instead of five stars. Food wise, it stands with the best gyros I've had. They have chicken, pork and my fave lamb and beef. Greek salad withe feta cheese, hummus and ah-so tempting baklava. Murray's review says they are open till 4am. If I was up that late and was hungry, I'd go there."}
{"text":"Came on a whim with the parents because we were curious and I'm ALWAYS in the mood for a gyro. Although once we arrived, I got distracted by all the other tasty - sounding stuff and I didn't get a gyro. Oops.   The place was totally empty when we arrived, but that meant the nice guy behind the counter could help my overwhelmed (and occasionally indecisive) family decide!   We started with the dolmades. I'm a sucker for stuffed grape leaves and these were stunning. Warm, savory, melt in your mouth awesome. And the tzatziki that came with them was out of this world! I need to check if they sell the stuff by the gallon because I'd totally buy it to have at home.   Mom and dad both got gyros--pork and lamb respectively. Both ended up eating them with a fork because there was so much meat and filling that the gyro was just falling apart! I had a taste of each and give two thumbs up to both.   I had the stuffed cabbage (can't remember the whole name... Lahanasomething) and was very pleased. The lemon sauce was tasty, the cabbage wasn't watery, and the filling was very savory and even a bit sweet, which went well with the lemon sauce. I chose the Greek green beans as my side. They were a bit spicy which was exiting!   As I mentioned, the place was empty when we arrived but the bar portion was filling up slowly. Turns out they do live music on the weekends! We had to head home before the show started, but I want to go back again to get a gyro and to listen to some live Greek music :)"}
{"text":"I've tried several items on the menu including gyros, salads, fries, Diwali, and Greek platters, all have been delicious! Great for takeout or delivery"}
{"text":"love the authentic greek salad and the gyro was superb, cooked on a spit outdoors, what more can you say....very good dishes."}
{"text":"Awesome local Greek place. I've gotten takeout from here a couple times, and they totally remind me of my now-closed favorite gyro shack from my time in New York City. I am very, very happy to have a sweet place like this literally on my drive home from work. Quality and quickness are great, as is pricing. AND they offer a seven-pound mega-gyro challenge that I will take when I want to throw off the shackles of any semblance of a healthy lifestyle."}
{"text":"place was ok, but I think the high reviews here are more a symptom of the dearth of greek restaurants in the Cleveland area.  so, the people just dont know any better.  for the price I paid, the portion was too small.  I left hungry.  also, didnt like the looks of some of the workers in there.  Too american and shuddered to think that one or more of them may have made my food.  Owners seemed to cater to their workers to much instead of slapping them down and putting them to work and making sure they were serious and on-task.   the food wasnt bad, but nothing earth-shattering.  I've had better."}
{"text":"Place is full of arrogant morons.  Tried to order and got put on hold for 10 minutes....when I called back I got attitude.  Miserable customer service and I wouldnt give them a dime....."}
{"text":"Plenty of options when it comes to the gyros which are a solid product. Open late and will not disappoint."}
{"text":"I have to first state that due to my diet restrictions, my reviews are based on what I can specifically eat and how/if the restaurant is able to accommodate their menu to meet my needs. This generally means that I cannot eat what a place is known for.   I ordered the chicken kabobs with some rice and hummus. The chicken was dry and had no taste what so ever. The rice was ok and the biggest disappointment was the hummus. It was just bland.   If you want to sit down and eat inside, there is very limited seating and it was extremely hot inside, so I ended up taking the food to go.  The people I went with said that the Gyro was great. Based on my meal, I think I will try another Greek restaurant."}
{"text":"SUMMARY:  It's oook.  FULL STORY:  It's ok.  Definitely more like low-key, late-night food. Veggie quality isn't the best, but they do use big cucumber rounds. Tzatziki is pretty good.    For a bag of pita, it's the frozen / thawed 6\" white flatbreads -- it's a bag of 10 for $8.   You can pretty much count on something being left out of an order and/or out of stock... every time.  Note: Delivery through GrubHub"}
{"text":"I will start by saying this place has the BEST red pepper hummus I've ever had.  That being said, I still have to give a 3 star rating based on the service.  I went today for lunch.  We ordered 2 gyros and an order of hummus at 12:30.  It took nearly 20 mins for the hummus to arrive.  At 1:15, I approached the counter to cancel the gyro order, but they were just about to bring it out so we took it to go.  45 mins to get 2 sandwiches is a bit much when you only have 1 hour for lunch.   People who arrived 30 mins after us were receiving their food before us.  There was obviously some kind of mix up but nothing was communicated to us.  We just sat and waited.      It appeared there was only 2 people on staff.  The cook, and a girl running the register.   She appeared overwhelmed with answering the phones, ringing folks up, and trying to run food all on her own."}
{"text":"It's honest.  It's a Lakewood staple, and they deliver delightful bags of greasy, fatty delicious meat to your doorstep.  The food is good, consistent, and filling.    I prefer the pork gyro dirty style.  Paired with a side of onion rings means a great gut-bomb to put you to rest for the evening and satiate hunger.    Eating in isn't a fancy experience.  It's tables, chairs, and not much else- but it doesn't NEED to be anything else.  It's a gyro place that stays open late.  It doesn't need much more."}
{"text":"First time visiting today.  The chicken Gyro was garbage.  Bald cook behind the counter with bad attitude and poor hygiene.  I saw him pick something off my chicken with his fingers while it was still on grill.  Chicken under seasoned....it wasn't a chicken gyro like advertised...it was a chicken pita WTF?  I can get that at Wendy's.  He was slamming cupboard doors...Felt bad for the young girl working there. Def will not go back"}
{"text":"Looking for take-out that is fairly speedy but delicious?  This is the place to go.  I've stopped by for take-out about a dozen times on a friend's recommendation and have never been disappointed.  Usually I have the moussaka with green beans, grape leaves (with a yogurt cucumber dipping sauce), or a gyro-- all are A1.  Can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"I'm upset with myself for living so close to this gem and not visiting until this evening. My boyfriend and I decided to finally try this spot and we were not disappointed. The place is very unseeming from the outside, but I love all of the details that go into it.   Before we went, we tried to look up the menu on their website but were frustrated that it was blurry and could not be enlarged. This was not a big deal as we just went in to look at the menu.   They have a lot of different options for food but we went the traditional route and tried some gyros. I got chicken based off of all the rave reviews I saw and it was delicious. My boyfriend ordered the American and his was even better! We also checked in and got a huge free order of fries and order spinach artichoke dip with pita bread. It was beyond tasty!  Overall I enjoyed everything about this place from the decor to the food to the super friendly staff. Our order was also ready very quickly. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Service here has gone down hill. I don't know if they have new management or not but it really seems like it. We ordered 4 gyros one with a change (sauce on the side). There  was no sauce on any of them and there was only 1 cup in the bag. The food otherwise was good. The wait time was pretty bad but not horrible.  The last few times have been the same. Last time we didn't even change anything. Ordered 3 thing as is off the menu and each of them was missing something.   Oh yeah.. and they were out of chicken last night too. I ordered at 5:30 and they were already out of chicken. So soneone didn't order correctly or they dropped it  but either way 2 of us had to change our order."}
{"text":"Their grilled chicken is wonderfully fresh and juicy, and the dips are delicious!  Their pita is the best I've had outside of Greece, and the staff couldn't be nicer. And quick delivery too!  Everything arrived at the right temperature. I look forward to ordering again!"}
{"text":"Oh yeah! Love me some GVG! I can't believe I never knew about this place until a couple of months ago. Back in March I was having gyro withdrawals after eating at an AMAZING place in Florida (see Plaka review). If only I had known I had a place right in my backyard that was competitively delicious!   Fast, fresh, amazing and cheap food. The owner and staff are all super friendly and they are open til at least 11 most nights. Altogether awesome place to take care of your gyro cravings. We've had the chicken gyro, American, and Greek gyros. All fantastic. They even have a decent selection of Greek imported foods and beers for takeout. It's going to be dangerous living within a half mile of this place now...must. resist. the. urge. to GVG! Oh what the hell....get you some!"}
{"text":"ok my review is strictly based off of the service not the food.  food was good that's why I gave them 2 stars.  first it took about 1hr from order to delivery, then he forgot my drink.  no utensils and the napkins were soaked in oil.  I don't blame the driver, but I do blame the establishment.  how they can deliver hummus and rice pilaf with no spoon or fork is ridiculous.  and the napkins I have no idea if the napkins were used to wipe a counter or if the oil leaked everywhere.  again food was ok but everything else was crap."}
{"text":"I always get my gyros from here. I usually get the 'small' gyro, which basically just has less meat. The regular size is overflowing and while it is delicious i usually end up wearing half of it because I'm a mess in all aspects of the word. The fries are great too when fresh, but when you get them delivered they tend be soggy... but that's the price you must pay when you're too lazy to drive two minuets up the road."}
{"text":"Yes, back again today and finally I forced myself to try something different than the American Gyro. Got a combination chicken/pork gyro (hey, I didn't say I made a DRASTIC change) and, man, it was awesome as usual. This place has got it going on. It's not Lola but what it is is special all the same. I've said it before and will say it again, great food, very reasonable prices, extremely nice people...what, you need a written invitation??? GO!!! Enjoy.   You're welcome. :)"}
{"text":"I like what the owner is trying to do with the place, I really can respect that. And I've given Greek Village many tries before coming up with this review. I always get a stomachache after eating here. And each time, its been different food. And the counter service is 50/50 at best, sometimes they're really nice, others I felt like I was an outsider.  Not cool Zeus, not cool."}
{"text":"Had the souvlaki plate, the greek salad and a pork gyro.  I liked the souvlaki plate the best.  Although the pork was salty, it was nicely grilled.  On the other hand, the pork gyro \"with everything\" was mostly filled with pork and very little anything else.  While it is admirable to stuff your gyro with a lot of meat, this isn't like a corned beef sandwich--I actually like to taste some tomato and onion in mine.  Also, the prices were kind of high overall.  Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Authentic Greek food comes alive here! The gyros are absolutely amazing and can be devoured within seconds, pace yourself! The calamari is cooked well, But lacks a great deal of flavor; add some lemon and you'll do fine.  With a wide array of food to choose from, you cannot go wrong with selecting a class Greek dish, just ask! They are great for ordering out or dining in, if you are able, try the mussels; bravo to that!"}
{"text":"What a great place for delicious, greasy food! I got a late-night lamb gyro the other night with an order of fries. Yes, it made my stomach a little uneasy, but what do you expect from this kind of food? It hit the spot. But watch out. There are so many onions that you will still taste them after two teeth brushings, haha."}
{"text":"Best gyros we've had I CLE so far! I'm going to attempt the Mount Olympus challenge one day also!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice so far, and both times I was really pleased with the service and the food.   Really sizable Gyros and Souvlaki for less than $5!! Right on!  This is the real deal, carved off of a vertical rotating spit.    The \"Greek\" gyro made with pork rather than the usual Lamb/Beef meat alloy was a great surprise.  Moist chunks of seasoned pork go really well with the standard toppings (though moist chunks of pork go well with pretty much anything, don't they?)  The fresh-cut Greek-seasoned fries are good, and though I personally haven't strayed off of the sandwich menu, I've been told by reliable sources that their dips (hummus, etc.) are amazing.    Hard to say if these gyros are better than my beloved Mezza's in Westlake.  At the very least, they're just as delicious."}
{"text":"Skip this place.  I have been there twice. First time they screwed up my order.  It was  to go.... found out when I got home.  Second time they did it again.   We won't get fooled again!"}
{"text":"Best Gyros around.  Finding an actual authentic Gyro place isnt easy but Greek Village is fantastic.  Good portion size as well. They have a ton of different crazy gyro options to try out. They also deliver and are open late. Tey the double meat option for a couple bucks more. Sure to fill you up."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of when Angelo's Pizza used to be decent. When they had the white boxes with blue writing. The Greek Village Grille is housed in the former location of Angelo's. The food is pretty good and at good prices. I cannot figure out for the life of me why people wait in line forever for Steve's gyros at Westside Market. This place has gyros that are just as good and you don't have to waste your life away in line for them. If you are drinking next door at the Richland Cafe, you can place an order at the bar and Greek Village will run it over to you. Richland is a decent place to drink. They now carry craft beers and redid the interior. One of my friends met a girl at the Richland and took her across the street to the Lakewood High football field and had sex with her on the 50 yard line. A very romantic night indeed. Another friend recently met a girl at the Richland and took her home for romance. He described a certain move she performed as something out of the Matrix. I think I may start hanging out at the Richland! And eating gyros from Greek Village!"}
{"text":"This mom & pop greek restaurant was phenomenal!!!  I got a JUMBO gyro,which was enough for me to eat and take some home as well.  The gyro meat was seasoned beyond perfection.  Even after I was full, I found myself still nibbling on the meat, just because the taste was so tempting.  The staff there was very down to earth and made our time there even better.  The fries were pretty good as well.  Even better - they are open late and they deliver!!!!  I wish I would have found this place sooner!"}
{"text":"I went to a potluck today and needed to bring grub. Seeing as how the peeps i was visiting don't want dog hair in their food, i decided cooking at home was not an option. What to bring....everyone loves Greek food!   I stopped on the way and ordered three portions of spanakopita, one grape leaves portion and two little containers of powdered cookies. It took all of ten minutes. Bravo! The service was very friendly even in this stifling heat. Total was 15 bucks and i think everyone got a taste of these goodies. And no dog hair. I didn't think this place would make it based on location and the economy, but it seems to be thriving. I wish them many more years of success."}
{"text":"Horrible service and they charge you for a big gyro but give you regular size. And the. They lie about it."}
{"text":"Just ordered dinner for tonight, got here quick. Food was amazing - will definitely order again"}
{"text":"Yummy gyros. Fries are usually a little undercooked for my taste. Prices could be a little cheaper. Overall a good place to order from every now and then when you're craving a gyro! Nice that they deliver. The spinach artichoke dip is delicious.  EDIT: 9/10/2016 My previous review of this place was much better, but I had a terrible experience tonight so I had to update. The service was just terrible. I live 6 minutes away. I ordered online at 6:12 and got my food at 755. Nearly 2 hours later. I called once to check on it to make sure it went through.  She told me the delivery guy had 4 orders and mine was on its way. Great, its gonna be cold. It was barely lukewarm when it arrived. Food is great. Also, don't know if there is something wrong with their online ordering but I did not receive the item I ordered and when I called back she insisted I had ordered it. So I spent 6.50 on a tub of tazitki sauce instead of my delicious spinach dip that I always order. And it took 2 hours to get it. When I called they offered no solutions. I will go elsewhere from now on which is too bad because a gyro place that delivers is awesome! Unfortunately the service is just too lacking :("}
{"text":"For those who've never tried this cuisine, based on our experience you'll have the best first impression of Greek foods by starting with the 4 and 5 star choices.  . The Greek Village Grille wasn't my first time scaling the craggy edges up Mt. Olympus.  In addition to stateside Greek restaurants and stands I've made my own pita bread, gyro meat, tzatziki sauce, mousaka and baklava only because the hit-or-miss of the flavorful foods of Greece became too bothersome.  I had quite good results with my own---but would love to find a place that could serve it up without my lifting a single phyllo sheet.  The results here ranged from Oh, YES!---to Oh, NO!  GREAT .......  all 5 star ~ PITA (white)    extraordinary---none better...like little pillows for Aphrodite  ~ AMERICAN GYRO MEAT    the flavor of the lamb and beef combination was nothing short of mythological perfection...no mutton hint at all...fairly thin-sliced---the best and only way ~ TZATZIKI SAUCE    the other \"nectar of the gods\" ...where did they get this recipe from?  Zeus, himself?    IN-BETWEEN .......  would order again  ~ SPANAKOPITA * * * *    very good preparation...phyllo texture just right with slightly crisp exterior...but filling a little too-undercooked---would have been much better with just another 2-3 minutes cooking time added  ~ DOLMADES * * *     perfect leaves...a touch too-intensely flavored ... fabulously seasoned, but better if a little less used...rice too soft ~ FRIES * * *     unfortunately, cooled down too much by the time we got it home ...I'll bet they're very good fresh, eaten in  THE WRATH OF HADES ...  XXXXX (5 Don't Do It's) ~ GREEK GYRO, Dirty Style         Instead, got what I'd call the DIRTY GREEK. No edible pork pieces.  A scary mix of scraps---fat, gristle, and sinew---that would normally be trimmed off and thrown away.  A stew straight from the netherworld, I picked through it for meat---a tiny bit here, a few shreds there.  After ending up with the equivalent of maybe a couple of bites, I gave up.  Had this been the only choice made off their menu, I'd be afraid to try anything else, so very likely would never return.  (After this visit I read an earlier review by someone who liked this gyro and wrote that the fat or other (?) was the \"nature of the beast\", or something like that.  Not for me.  Never ate food like this growing up---or now---or ever.  I've never even fed anything like this to my dogs.  If I did, they'd look up at me puzzled, then walk away from their bowls.  For anyone who doesn't mind scraps in their food---awlgh---be my guest.)    ****WHAT SAVED THEIR STAR STATUS**** ~ AMERICAN GYRO Regular Style * * * * *    blend of roasted lamb and beef topped with tomato, raw onion, and tzatziki sauce, wrapped in their pita.   Excellent.  Will be back for this, but will steer clear of ANYTHING with pork. ."}
{"text":"Late night  gyro craving spot!  Open until 3 am on Friday and Saturday. Wow~ I can't wait to go back to try the chicken gyro.  I had the original Greek which is pork.  Pork?  Who knew that is the authentic way to order.  Hubby had the American version of lamb/beef and brother got a feast of all 3 meats with pita and sauce.  The sauce is so yummy and the pita is fresh, soft and warm.  If you want Baklava, go early.  They were already out.  Staff was friendly and hardworking folks."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Excellent service! The chicken gyro is awesome! So flavorful! The fries were perfect! I don't think we can have a chicken gyro at another place after having the one here."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place!! I've had it on multiple occasions. I've dined in, carried out, and actually had it delivered last night (to downtown through grubhub!! I was feeling lazy and was super pumped when I saw them on the list of restaurants!!!).   The food is GREAT, the people who work there are SO friendly, delivery was fast and everything was fresh, and everything is very decently priced (I'm talking everything under 10 dollars - except the platters/combos)! We were talking about GVG the other day, which prompted me to get food delivered last night. Amazing as always.   I know their specialty is their Gyros, but it's SUPER veggie friendly, too :) I always get their veggie wrap - lettuce, tomatoes, cukes, onions, greek spread, feta (you can add more toppings), on a warm pita. Their seasoned fries are decent, I've only had them once and wasn't all that impressed, so haven't had them since. I lovelovelove their spanakopita! And, their hot spinach and artichoke dip is ridiculously creamy and delicious - served with pita triangles that are flash fried and add to the awesomeness. I wasn't crazy impressed with the Tyrokafteri (spicy feta dip) - basically tasted like feta with hot sauce mixed in. Still tasted good, though... I mean it's CHEESE.. and hot sauce! And it came with the delish, fried pitas!  They just opened a location in broadview heights. I hope they continue to expand and open new locations :) (maaaaybeeee a downtown one??? I'd probably be their number one customer!) - but for now, I'll continue making my way over to the Lakewood location :)"}
{"text":"Great, authentic Greek cuisine made fresh to order!  Tommy, the owner is very friendly and a great cook.  You can't go wrong with the American gyro, but the Greek gyro (marinated pork) is also very delicious!  It can be a bit fatty sometimes though, but that's the nature of the beast.  The chicken gyro can be good, but can also be a bit dry sometimes.  I've had the (American) philly gyro and it was overstuffed with tasty goodness!  The dolmades (stuffed grape leaves) are awesome!  If you get them along with a gyro and beverage, your meal is set!  Side salads are also fresh and crisp!  They're open late!  (3am on weekends)  Great late night meal!  Opa!"}
{"text":"Nine of us went together, so I got to taste a ton of stuff from the menu.  Tyropita, feta saganaki, dolmades, american gyro (not greek), tzatziki, rice pilaf, and gyro balls were all REALLY good.  However, I was not impressed by the pastitsio, and the kritharaki was so bad no one would eat it.  The chick working the register was nice.  It seemed like it took a long time for our food at a fast casual place though.  I would go back and just get appetizers next time."}
