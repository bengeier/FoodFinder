{"text":"This quaint cafe is located in the industrial area but only minutes off of Blackfoot Trail.  Definitely worth the trek off the beaten path to dine here!  The food is wholesome, fresh ingredients, freshly baked muffins onsite with great sandwiches, soups, salads, daily specials and their specialty is burgers.  If you are adventurous and like a twist to your scratch made burgers, this is the place to come.  They have a Clubhouse Burger with turkey, bacon, cheese and barbeque sauce.  The Donair Burger is made with lean ground beef sliced thin and piled high with cheese and their special sweet sauce. Then they have a Japanese Burger with wasabi mayo, pickled ginger and teriyaki sauce and a Hawaiian Burger with swiss cheese, ham, pineapple and terriyaki sauce and they all come with lettuce, tomato and fresh cut fries from real potatoes (not the prepackaged frozen ones) all for $7.50 - Unbelievable!  All their sauces, soups, stocks are freshly made not bottled as I can taste that a mile away.  They also do catering as I saw some amazing platters of wraps, sandwiches, fruit and veggie platters heading out the door as I was coming in for lunch.  Simon, the owner is friendly, accommodating and takes great pride and joy in preparing his food for you.  They are open Monday to Friday from 6AM to 3PM and Saturday from 8AM to 12 Noon for breakfast.  I tried their Super Breakfast which comes with 3 eggs, 2 strips of crisp bacon, 2 sausages, 2 slices of ham, potatoes and toast for $7.50 - it was soooo good and I felt bad that I couldn't finish it!   So run, don't walk to check out this great little cafe that is now on my foodie radar!!  You can get a  great meal and a drink for under $10, so this is a hidden little gem that I needed to share."}
{"text":"I am so impressed by the quality and value at this little cafe.  When you walk in, its spacious, clean and inviting.  Theres a table that has coffee, funky mugs and some to-go cups so that people can just grab or refill their coffee.  Theres a little hand written sign as well that advises that refills on your fries are always free.  The gal behind the counter is smiley, friendly and welcoming.  they seem to have two specials every day.  The two i have seen is a warm lunch special, and a homemade soup and biscuit special.  Both times I tried this cafe, I got the hot lunch.  Day 1, it was a honey garlic chicken leg on rice for 7.95.  Today, it was baked spaghetti and meatballs with garlic bread for $7.95.  Tuesdays and Fridays they have a free treat with your lunch as well.  Both meals were awesome.  The chicken was cooked to perfection, juicy and a nice flavourful honey garlic on the skin.  Today the baked spaghetti and meatballs was cooked to perfection, not spicy, but flavourful, with melted cheese on top.  The best way to describe this place is it is home cooked food in a restaurant.  nothing about these meals have been processed.  I could tell that the meatballs were handmade (not the perfectly symmetrical ones you get out of a bag).  These guys are the real deal.  I am blown away this place is not lined up out the door.  It is always steady in there, but at these prices and quality it should be a stampede."}
