{"text":"The flavors are so authentic to Vietnam. The pho was great and the beef stew has to be the best in Charlotte. Definitely give it a try."}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Vietnamese food! really nice service!! Recommend make your own role, and a lot of good soups. Canh chua soup, bun sandwiches are excellent."}
{"text":"The pho was delicious. My boyfriend didn't really get what he asked for but he still enjoyed it. It was a bit dark and awkwardly quiet for the environment, so it kinda made me feel uncomfortable but food was still delicious. Our server didn't have much to say to us until the end. Music came on when we were about to leave though (3PM).  Definitely would come back to try the other foods!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious, and the service was great. If you're looking for authentic, well done Vietnamese food this is the place to be. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the pho, chicken wings and especially the seafood hot pot. FYI. The hot pot is for sharing so much to share. Enjoy."}
{"text":"The restaurant owners are super friendly and the food they provide is out of this world delicious! Gives a great sense of the pallet of Vietnam"}
{"text":"This building, which housed the much missed Ben Thahn, seems to be a magical place for Vietnamese restaurants because the newly opened Hoan Doan is already looking mighty promising. While the pho was not as impressive as the one its predecessor put out, this joint has a lot to offer. The fact that the waitresses are a couple of super cute, charmingly bubbly girls that are very good at their jobs doesn't hurt their case either. I didn't notice any of the normal hiccups that plague most newly opened restaurants. The only little thing I noticed was that the pho took a little longer than normal to arrive but that could have been because she was timing its arrival after we received our egg rolls.  So about this food then...I ordered the egg rolls, and a medium combination pho. The egg rolls arrived (extremely) hot and were wonderfully crispy on the outside. The inside was filled with a very well seasoned mixture of ground pork, mushrooms and other veggies. I could have eaten 100 of these. Yum. The combination pho, which had a little bit of all the meats, rare steak, brisket, meatball, fatty flank and tripe, seemed very authentic though I did want a touch more intensity in the broth flavor. The meats were all great, my first time eating tripe in pho, and the meatballs were especially tasty. There was a nice little bit of fat in the broth, which I appreciated since I usually request fatty broth. I ordered the medium and could have easily been set with the small. My man had the same realization but expressed that with a small there might not many leftovers. I saw and smelled other food go by and there are definitely other dishes to come back in to try. The combination rice dish, for example, smelled so amazing that I had to ask the waitress what it was. That is what I will get next time.  While I might go elsewhere when I get that hankering for pho, I will undoubtably return to try the other dishes and receive excellent service like I did today (always love when a waitress doesn't even give my water the opportunity to be empty). I hope this place sticks around."}
