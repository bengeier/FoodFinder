{"text":"We were driving through Madison and stopped on a recommendation. We both ordered grilled tenderloins and received fried. The server never checked on us or refilled our drinks...never even looked our way. We have now been waiting for 10 minutes for our check. I would understand if they were busy but they're not."}
{"text":"Not a lot on the menu but the food was good and the scenery was great! There are several places to eat within two minutes of this place, but it's worth trying!"}
{"text":"Location is awesome!  I love sitting on the river and watching the water quietly roll by.  Only that would make it better is good food and service.  They go thru servers quickly.  I'm a craft beer guy and all they serve are macros.  I still enjoy a corona on the river, but a choice would be nice.  Everything is basically fried or was frozen.  It's still worth the experience to sit on the river and watch the sunset, just don't expect a fine dining experience.   A year later:  I'm sick of going down to have a nice dinner on a beautiful evening and having it ruined by nonexistent service.  Seriously, how hard is it to train servers or hire decent staff? The food is basically acceptable, but that's all I can say.  I ordered a club sandwich and opened it to add condiments and realized I was given rotten lettuce. The addition of rubber feet on the tables and chairs would be smart to cut down on the noise of lazy staff dragging them across the metal hollow floor.  Now to top off the evening after waiting 20 mins for my check I was told that it was cash only!! So I was prompted to the ATM machine which charged me $3.00.  If the next owner doesn't improve things I do not plan on voluntarily supporting this business.  It is honestly an embarrassment to me to have this place in Madison as a tourist place."}
{"text":"Day trip from NW Indy. 2 hours 20 minutes door to door. Overall the town is a GREAT destination. If you dig old architecture and waterfront it's an A+. Super motorcycle ride down. Great burger, the little woman had  what she termed a \"very good\" chicken salad which is a rare rating. We really like waterfront joints. This is really a joint and or dive. Service was good but it was 3pm on a Sunday so not much of a test. Once again not a fufu location but a very good bar fare location. The unknown diner digs it! Great biker destination."}
{"text":"Service was fine, food was run of the mill factory food from GFS. To the guy that said best burger I've had in a long time, where've you been prison?  Please."}
{"text":"As you walk up to the restaurant you have an idea of what you are getting into... the steep walk down the ramp will not be kind to the elderly or children beware. Inside you will find limited, cramped seating with a bustling short order style kitchen. The best place to sit and enjoy the view is the outdoor seating, highly recommended. The outdoor atmosphere was a mix between a red lobster and dirty fishing barge. The operation is cash only which is a downer for me. They do have two ATM's on site, one of which did not work and for a $3 convenience fee you can have access to your money.  The service was a little unfriendly and not very helpful. Having young children with us seemed to agitate the staff. Moving a table together only fanned the fire. After several minutes, we were finally offered the chance to order. We tried to order drinks and food together but we're interrupted when our waitress walked off... The kiddos had grilled cheese and chicken tenders, my wife had a fish sandwich and I went with the chicken club. The food was decent about what you would expect from a \"bar\" style restaurant. No drink refills were offered even when I prompted the waitress. One plus to the restaurant is the ability to feed the fish with the left over food.  Poor service, cash only, and mediocre food... stick to Main St when you are in Madison."}
{"text":"We loved this little place! Don't go for gourmet fare but for pub grub, we enjoyed ourselves. I had the fish sandwich and it was very good. We bombed this small, charming restaurant with many people all at once. They handled it with good humor. Our food came out all at once and our drinks were kept filled. What else can you ask for? Well, you could ask for a charming docked boat as a restaurant and a beautiful view of the river! I'd go back in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"The Lighthouse is our regular spot when we visit Madison and in the mood for a bountiful feast.  Setting along the Ohio River while having a great sandwich, sipping an amazing margarita, and watching the sun set is pretty hard to beat.  What can I say except food is very good and the staff is very friendly.  Well worth the climb back up the ramps to the sidewalk...  anyway to work in an escalator for us old folks????"}
{"text":"you should come on in here for the river view but expect slow service and mediocre food. but its a great place to drink a cold beer and watch the river.   oh yeah and the guy who said the burgers were good and to try the house mustard was probably talking about shipleys tavern."}
{"text":"Simple dive bar to goto to have drinks on the river. Had some drinks with a friend of ours Jim and Nancy Macke with me and Toey. Just an average place to have a few drinks to enjoy the outside on the river bank of Ohio. Ordered some jalapeños poppers and a mix drink. I would come here again for just a few drinks and enjoy the nice weather on the river."}
{"text":"The menu is run of the mill pub food. Ribeye sandwich was a bit tough the beer made up for it though (Yuengling, not available in KY). The kiddos enjoyed the coleslaw, patty melt, and cheeseburger. Downside is they only accept cash, glad I noticed the sign at the top of the ramp or I'd been washing dishes. The big draw is being able to dine on the river and not just next to it. Kids loved feeding the ducks and catfish fries and bread. Was a great choice for family dining but not too fancy and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant for the first time during the Chataqua(spelling?) art festival a few months back. You walk down a ramp to the boat restaurant that sits on the river. We sat outside, the inside was small and packed. This is a cash-only restaurant, but they do have a ATM inside if needed. Our waitress was terrible. Not only did she not bring straws to the table, and when asked she said they ran out, the service was slow and she was unfriendly. My fiancé walked right up to the outside bar and got straws from the bartender. The food itself is decent, with a moderate price. I had the Rueben, wasn't too bad but nothing to write home about. My fiancé had the grilled cheese and fries, which were pretty good. On paying for the meal I told my waitress I needed change. After waiting almost 10 minutes, we flagged her down. She acted like she totally forgot I was owed change. Terrible service, and yes it was busy due to the art festival but not at capacity. The view is wonderful with a cool dive-diner vibe, but the service has to be addressed to keep this place afloat-pun intended!  I may give them another try if we go back to the art festival next year, but did not have a goo first-impression."}
{"text":"Probably the best burger I've had in a while. My only regret is it was too big for me to finish. Definitely try the house mustard."}
{"text":"Pleasant atmosphere dining on the river, service was semi-attentive (there was no one around inside or outside when we arrived and had to find our server to cash out), food (fish sandwiches) were average and they only accept cash."}
{"text":"Staying briefly in Madison we decided to have lunch here on a Saturday during Memorial Day weekend. It was busy, but not packed.   So thankful this day to get out of the sun and sit in a shaded place for some lunch. The waitress who brought us our menus said it might take a bit of time since they were a bit busy, but we were in no rush so that was fine with us.   We got to order drinks and food pretty quickly anyway and drinks where then served not long after. As always it surprised me with the inflexibility at some restaurants when ordering. I don´t eat potatoes (not chips, not fries etc). When asking if I could have two servings of the slaw that was coming with my burger instead, the waitress friendly shook her head and said it wasn't possible... My burger was then served without the potato chips, but of course, still charging me full price, even if I don´t get the same worth.   Food tasted good! Ice tea was cold and good. I saw that one of the other waiters refilled the ice tea to his guests without them asking for it, but that was not happening at our table, and I didn´t ask for it either.  Service was promt, even though it was a bit busy, food was ok (far from wow, but still ok). Location is really what one is paying for choosing this restaurant, and its a great location, just on Ohio River!"}
