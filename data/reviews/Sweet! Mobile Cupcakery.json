{"text":"Great cupcakes and great service!   We had the Sweet! truck at our wedding back in September 2014 and it was a huge hit with our guests. Then in November 2015, my parents had 2 dozen Sweet! cupcakes delivered to my house for my birthday. Then, yesterday, we had Sweet! cupcakes delivered to our house for our son's First Birthday party!  Every time, Dave (the owner) has been great to work with. Always responsive and very prompt. And, most importantly, the cupcakes are absolutely delicious!!! Can't wait for the next milestone so we can order more cupcakes from the Sweet! Mobile Cupcakery =)"}
{"text":"Two words: cherry blossom -- that's all you need to know when you come up to the truck and you're still indecisive about what to get.   This is one of the most heavenly cupcakes I've ever had. The cake itself is moist and fresh. The frosting is light and it's not like some other cupcakes that leave your teeth sensitive after eating, nor is it underwhelming either. It's just right.   They participate in Walnut Wednesday's starting in May, but today was preview day where all the trucks get inspected. Service was fairly quick and the owner was there today, he was very friendly. Prices are good, I believe it was $3 for one and 2 for $5.   My only regret was that I only purchased one! I guess moderation is key. :)"}
{"text":"I am a sucker for a REALLY good cupcake, and I had yet to find one in CLE. Either too dry, too sweet, crunchy frosting...I mean, frosting isn't supposed to be hard or crunchy. Eww. I'm SURE there are places I must try, but haven't yet, but lucky for me this truck showed up at my office.   I grabbed a white cake (almond flavor to it) with vanilla buttercream and a buckeye cake. Both were totally delicious, moist, and the frosting was impeccable. Just the right amount, not too sweet, and definitely not crunchy. And that was 8 hours later when i finally got to eat them. (note: no sweets binge this time...I shared!) I need to track this truck down again. I'm in love. :)"}
{"text":"Saw this food truck next to Umami Moto at the Cleveland Institute of Art. I then deicded I had to get a cupcake! Picked the buckeye and was not disappointed! A little but pricey, but as soon as I had my first bite it was worth it."}
{"text":"Checked out this cupcake truck at the Fairview Park Food Truck Festival and I will have to say I am digging the pretty blue paint job! The staff was nice especially with trying to hear people over the loud band playing. Now for the cupcakes!  The cupcakes will run you $3 for one or $5 for 2. I think the $3 price tag is a bit much so I am glad they lower it slightly when you buy in bulk. I sampled Strawberry Lemonade (maybe it was raspberry? Don't remember because I ate it too fast), Salted Caramel, Wedding White (The Billy Idol), and Red Velvet. In all of them you could taste the great flavors they offered, my only big complaint would be that the cake itself was a little on the dry side and would easily crumble especially for the ones made with yellow cake. Other than that these cupcakes were good! They are the standard cupcake size and had a perfect cake to frosting ratio (one did not overpower the other). My favorite was the Strawberry Lemonade. Wedding White had a lovely white cake that had a slight almond flavor to it. The icing on the Red Velvet seemed to be light on the cream cheese flavor and had more of a standard light texture frosting compared to the thicker/creamier cream cheese frosting I am used to. The caramel syrup on the Salted Caramel seemed to have soaked into the cake which added a tasty, but needed, moistness to it.    I would rate these a solid 3.5. The best cupcakes I've ever had still goes to Cora Cupcakes in Painesville, but Sweet! Mobile Cupcakery definitely does a fine job as well. Give them a try next time you see them around town!"}
{"text":"First, the good stuff- the cupcakes are really, really tasty. I've had several varieties, including the Buckeye (peanut butter-chocolate) and the lemon-banana. They do not have too much frosting, nor is it so sweet that your teeth will hurt. However, every time I've visited, service has been really slow. Not sure if that is due to indecisive customers or the person doling out the goods, but it's annoying."}
{"text":"Hit them up while waiting for my lunch from another foodtruck during Walnut Wednesdays.   No line, friendly service, takes credit/debit card. Should get there early though because they were sold out of about half their options later in the afternoon."}
{"text":"I stopped at the truck tonight at Lincoln Park, during the Farmers' Market. I was looking to take home something sweet, and thought I would give their cupcakes a try. I love the salted caramel cupcake from A Cookie and a Cupcake, so I thought that I would try Sweet's for comparison. YUCK! Way too much salt in both the frosting and the cupcake. I spit it out. I am not a person who spits out sweets. It has to be BAD for me to be unable to eat it. It was disgusting. On the salted caramel alone, I would give them one star. I did also get the buckeye cupcake, and it was okay. I've definitely had better. However, it was edible, and so that's why overall I'm giving them two stars. I may try another flavor, but I will be very careful in choosing, and warn everyone to stay away from the salted caramel. It was gross."}
{"text":"Terrific cupcakes!  We were so pleased with the Mobile Cupcakery experience! We called many mobile trucks in town but all had closed for the winter. What?! But not these guys!  We called, picked a day, location, time, headcount and flavors. Done.  They arrived the next day and treated everyone.  Very reasonable priced Great customer service Really moist, flavorful cupcakes Impressive truck  A great treat!!"}
{"text":"You know when you bite into a cupcake and it's too dry and has a mountain of ridiculously sweet icing on top? Hate that! Well, you don't have to worry about that with the cupcakes in this truck! I got the buckeye cupcake when this truck was at Walnut Wednesday. The line was short and fast. The guy who helped me was SO nice!! And the cupcake was delicious. Like i mentioned earlier, it wasn't too sweet- just perfect. The cake was moist and tasted fresh, and there was just the right amount of icing on top- buttercream that was again- just the right sweetness.   DELISH. Can't wait to try the other flavors!"}
