{"text":"After hearing from a co-worker about how awesome Opa was, I wanted to try it out. This was a few years ago, and I was still getting used to Mediterranean food. So one day I decided to break from the norm, which was often just chicken burgers, and try it.  First off I had no idea what to order, so I asked the cashier what he recommended, of course he said the Chicken Pita wrap with greek salad. One bite and I was in love.   One thing I noticed though, is that this location seems to make some of the better pita wraps, but it really depends on the effort of the person who is making it, and the craftmanship the worker is willing to add.  But Opa definitely was the starting point to my foods that come in all kinds of wrapped goodness addiction."}
{"text":"Hey,   So, I've been to LOTS of the Opa's in Calgary and area, and one thing they have in common is that they are all AMAZING. How do you say 'delicious food that's good for you?'...it's Opa, as far as I'm concerned.   The Opa that I've been going to lately has been the one in Sunridge mall, but I've been to the one in North Hill Mall, SouthCentre, Chinook, Market Mall, Crowfoot, Canada Olympic Park, Cochrane and Signal Hill too, and probably some other ones that I'm fogetting. They are all very good.   Today I got the number 8 on the menu, the low carb plate. It's basically a greek steak skewer with a greek salad, and I got a drink with it, for less than $9. I can't believe how good it is...like, that's the thing. I've been eating at Opa for years, and I've always gotten fantastic food there. Usually a place has a few bad days once in a while, but I've always had fantastic food at Opa..   One of the nice things about Opa is that you can choose what kind of greek skewer you want. They have chicken, steak, salmon, shrimp, gyros, souvlaki and maybe some others that I'm forgetting. I couldn't believe when they came out with salmon. I was like, what the heck, salmon? But you know what, it is absolutely FANTASTIC. I can't believe it...I didn't know you could have salmon 'Greek style', but apparently you can.   The number 1 on the menu is any skewer with a greek salad, pita break grilled and sliced into 4 pieces, with a roasted potato ,Greek style, awesome rice and tzatziki sauce. Number 2 is similar, except the salad is Ceasar salad instead of Greek salad. Number 5, Opa fries, is a wrap, with choices of fixings, tzatziki sauce and fries. The thing about the fries is that they are not just ordinary fries. Nothing at Opa is ordinary. Everything is done Greek style, and it is amazing that way. They put spices and lemon or lime juice on the fries and they are AWESOME !!!   I just want to mention something too. Like, if I go to the mall, most of the food is just junk. That's the thing, Opa is NOT junk at all. It's the furthest thing from junk you could eat. Opa is FANTASTIC...it's the kind of food you'd pay twice or three times more at a sit down restaurant. I really can't stress that enough. It's so healthy and delicious...people something think that you can't combine the two...well think again! Opa's done it with all of their food.   Sometimes, I don't understand why people eat the junk food at the food court right around Opa, and not Opa for the same price. Let's not confuse 'fast food' and 'food made fast'. You might think they are one and the same, but THEY ARE NOT, not by a long shot. With Opa, you can have that delicious, healthy food, for the same price as the other places in the food court AND made in the same time that it takes for the other places in the food court to make junk. Opa basically redefined what people can eat at malls.   The staff at the North Hill location are totally awesome. They're nice and friendly and you can tell that they believe in what they're making...and I believe in it too. They laugh at my cheesy jokes, which is nice of them. The staff and the Sunridge location are awesome too. They're friendly and they make the food really fast.   Opa, you guys ROCK. 5 stars all the way baby."}
{"text":"I was at this Opa today and it sucked!  Here's how it all played out folks. I went with 3 coworkers for lunch. We got to the mall at 1130 so that we could avoid the lunch rush. I had Opa on the weekend at a different location and it was so good I thought i would go back. As a vegetarian, the falafel option is a good one for me.  There was a girl behind the counter who looked like she should have been in  \"Night of the Living Dead\" eyes glazed over, completely ignorant to the fact that myself and someone else were waiting.  She was making a huge bowl of Salad ( I guess getting ready for the lunch rush I was trying to avoid).  A few minutes later ( literally) another staff member came out and was putting frozen kabobs of chicken and beef on the grill. She then stopped and took the guys order in front of me....then about 4 minutes later she got to me, another 5 minutes I was getting my food.  By that time the line was huge but that didn't affect the zombies behind the counter, they just kept continued to move at the same pace.   By the time I got to the table my coworkers were done! They had gotten thier food and eaten it in the time it took me to get mine.  Worst of all the greek salad was bland, watery and lacked any zing at all. I pitched that in the garbage. The falafel was good.   I can handle waiting, I can handle alot from service people if they are pleasant and acknowledge thier customers. This whole experience just sucked. I can't even say bad service, because essentially i was served by two robots, devoid of any interaction, work ethic, or warmth.  OPA! I dont think so..... i wont be back to this location."}
{"text":"Very good!  ...especially for mall food in a food court.  We stopped at the mall after traveling all day for a quick dinner.  OPA caught my attention, because the food looked very fresh and the staff seemed busy cooking and dishing-up plates with positive energy.  The menu sign also enticed me.  I ordered the OPA platter with shrimp.  The shrimp was cooked on the grill right in front of me and then th"}
