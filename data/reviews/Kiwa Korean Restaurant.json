{"text":"Finally a Korean restaurant we've been looking for! Authentic Korean restaurant with great service (a rare find), good quality ingredients (couldn't taste MSG), and a nice, calm ambience. They focus on the main dish itself, rather than providing excessive side dishes. Reasonably priced. We've had the bibimbap, gamjatang, and sauteed pork. A definite favorite in Calgary."}
{"text":"I have tried many Korean restaurants and have not been WOW'd until I tried Kiwa.  Kiwa has really good authentic Korean food I highly recommend them to anyone who is looking for some good eats. The seafood pancake is light, crispy and full of seafood, the best I ever had. The Gamgatang is super flavorful and delicious. I love this restaurant so much that I have been there over and over again."}
{"text":"It is good to finally have a Korean restaurant in this part of town.  The food is decent but the portions were a little small.  It was short staff too when we were there.  We will be here to try out their other menu items.

Parking can be challenging with KFC and a popular Vietnamese restaurant next door."}
{"text":"Food lacked quality and quantity. They charge for seconds for side dishes. They only allow either water or tea, not both."}
{"text":"Average Korean restaurant, selection is alright but it def is less compared to most, portions are decently sized but again if you are comparing it to other places then it's a bit less.

Been here about 4 times and I can say that it's very consistent in quality and service.

It's nice and quiet and hard to find tbh, you don't really notice it when walking by but if you are looking for some decent Korean food in that area I would say go and give it a try"}
