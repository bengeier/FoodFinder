{"text":"I've had takeout all over madison, and this is hands down the best. Fresh food, lots of variety, and of course, no greasy, MSG-filled monsters.  The last time I was in there, I heard someone call and ask if they had shrimp cocktail. The employee answering the phone was like, \"Absolutely not. We have CHINESE food.\"   !  ...Nice.  You gotta appreciate that.  [Apparently this location is changing its identity to Lee's something.]"}
{"text":"This is a great place to come for a well-priced Chinese meal. It's definitely nicer than Panda Express, but not really upscale either. The portions are also very generous, and we left more than satisfied."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese place here in Madison. My sister told me about this place but never went til about 4 years ago. We don't go there very often but they always remember us. The wait staff is very friendly,which I have never experienced in a Chinese restaurant ever. They know customer service to the T. I never have to ask for anything. The tea cup is always full. Service is prompt and quick with a smile. Food is the BEST. Take out is very quick too."}
