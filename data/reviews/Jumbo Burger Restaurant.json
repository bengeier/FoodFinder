{"text":"My favorite place in Pickering for home style burger and fries. George and his wife are outstanding people and make sure you are taken care of. Breakfast is a good option good too. Prefer local places like this to the chain eateries that have popped up."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a dive but it is also an excellent secret.   The staff is beyond friendly and although it is very outdated, the food really makes you feel like you're eating at home. Their breakfast is outstanding, I always get a western sandwich with cheese and it is filling!! This is always my first breakfast choice, however, let it be known that they are not open on Sundays!"}
{"text":"Finally had their Homemade Cheeseburger and it was delicious.  Price is good too.  I once worked at a restaurant that made homemade burgers that were amazing, but Jumbo Burger's homemade burgers are the best as of tonight.  I look forward to trying their Steak on a Kaiser next."}
{"text":"Craving for some breakfast and found this place on yelp. This hole in the wall restaurant is now one of my favourite breakfast place in the area. The decor inside is very outdated and kinda ghetto. I was surprised to see the amount of people inside.   Ordered the eggs with bacon, and the portion sizes were HUGE. Most places I've been to give you 3 strips of bacon, but I was totally surprised when my plate arrived with 5. For $7 you get 3 eggs, 5 strips of bacon, generous portion of home fries, and 2 slices of toast. Coffee or Tea included in the price as well!   The service was great and super friendly.   Cash only!"}

{"text":"working late again and passing by this place.  I cant resist.  Today i ordered the banquet burger and i dont think it gets any better than this.  A nice tasty well seasoned burger with bacon and cheese and whatever toppings you like on it.  The service is friendly and now the cook is my new best friend.  I have to stay on a time line but i will be back in town soon and i think i need to return because if the burger was this good, then whats the souvlaki like or the steak sandwich.....gotta try it all."}
{"text":"Well Let talk about jumbo Burger Restaurant. What can I say besides I've been going to this greasy spoon for about 15 years now and will keep going for many more years to come. First I want to mention he owner and his wife they are the most friendly people with an awesome staff. Service is always friendly and helpful. Now let's talk food they have a great menu with lots to choose from as you can see from my pics. I always get the home burger with bacon and cheese its big juicy and full of flavour but what I go for the most is the breakfast hands down the cheapest and best tasting. The thing I like the most about this place is where he gets his eggs and meats from which are local farmers so the eggs are nice and fresh and the bacon OMG the bacon is so good nice thick cuts not super salty and oh man the peameal bacon slices are huge. You know what everything you get from this place is big in portions. Another one of my favs are the homemade soups that they make. They have different one every day and they are all good super hardy jammed packed with ingredients you definitely don't just get a bowl of broth. You know what I can just keep going on about this place and there food so I suggest just to give them a try and I know you'll be back again and again. Did I mention the prices are awesome but it is cash only"}
{"text":"Amazing! Friendly and super affordable.. can't believe after all these years I have never been here till now."}
{"text":"Excellent choice for me and my family after a day at the Toronto Zoo.  The portions were huge, so big in fact, that I was the only one to finish my meal which was the fish and chips. The fish came in 2 large pieces with ample fries on the side. Our waitress was friendly and helpful.  They certainly won't win any awards for interior decor, but if you're hungry and want some man-sized portions, this is the place to go in Pickering."}
{"text":"With so many good reviews, I had to see what this place was all about, especially since it's not too far from home. With a name like Jumbo Burger, I was looking forward to a good burger.  Impressions? It's dark in here. There's a larger dining area towards the back of the restaurant with dim pendant lights and a fan hanging from the ceiling. This place could definitely use a makeover. Or maybe that's just a part of its charm.  Their menu has a lot of choices for breakfast items, sandwiches, some Greek souvlaki and gyros, and some old school diner favourites like hot hamburger, grilled liver, ham steak, and pork chops. They also have regular (frozen?) and home made burgers. That's what I came for!  I ordered a home made banquet burger (cheese and bacon) and I got a good old fashioned burger with a slice of cheddar and lots of bacon for 6.95. Fries with gravy was an extra 3.50. The burger patty definitely looked hand formed and it was seasoned, maybe with some Mediterranean influences. It was good and the fries were crispy.  Looking around at what other diners were having, all the portions were huge! The souvlaki looked and smelled good. I may just have to try that next time."}
{"text":"None of us expected this little hole-in-the-wall to have such amazing food, so we were pleasantly surprised. I had the club sandwich, and the fresh grilled chicken was so moist and juicy I was amazed. I can't make it anywhere near this good at home... I hope to be back!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great value.  The best spot in Pickering for breakfast by far."}
