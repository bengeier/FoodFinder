{"text":"My co-worker recommended this place, so me and my other 3 girlfriends gave it a try. It's a huge place, atmosphere is very welcoming and spacious with lots of tv in all corners. We ordered non-breaded chicken wings,with chipotle sauce and tasted really good, the girls love them.Then we also tried their thin crust pizza, I had the Four Season and finished it to the last piece.If you like to just relax and chill with great friends, this place is good for you, if you want a fancy place then you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"I saw a deal on Groupon for these guys do I thought I'd check them out. The place is on Victoria park and Steeles.  Plenty of parking. Came Saturday for dinner and it was empty. There were literally only 2 people sitting down in the whole place. Anyways we still decided to give it a shot so we got the Margarita pizza, pulled pork potato skins, a Philly cheese sandwich and a burger. The burger was OK, nothing special. The Philly cheese was oily and disgusting. The pizza was undercooked and missing seasoning and the potato skins were the best part of the meal who again were just OK at best. Overall for a dead place it took quite a while to get the food out and it was definitely not worth the wait. We will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting. Dead. Nasty. Feel sick. Wings freezer burned, steak had a burnt taste although not burnt dessert inedible. Yuck. Would have left after walking in if I didn't have a groupon. How this place is still in business is beyond me."}
{"text":"The other reviews that are 1-2 stars are pretty accurate. Empty place yet still extremely slow service, subpar food. Didn't seem very clean, fruit fly was in my beer. Don't even bother, save your money."}
{"text":"I have been sitting at the bar now for over an hour. The bartender spent the first 15 minutes arm wrestling and flirting with her boyfriend. When I finally ordered I got a beer and ordered a pizza. An hour after ordering she tells me she has no idea where my burger is. I respond that's fine I didn't order a burger, where is my pizza. She says oh right Chicken Jerk. Again I say nope, pulled pork. Needless to say I will never be back, I've been waiting for an hour for a pizza that has never arrived. I am packing up and I am leaving."}
{"text":"Tried this place today and wasn't half bad. A little pricey considering they aren't an upscale restaurant and seem like a pizza, pasta and wings sports bar type place.  I ordered the pesto pizza and it was pretty decent. The poutine was alright. Service was pretty good, meal was out after 15 mins or so, too bad they served the appetizer at the same time as the main entree.   The Italian waiter is a nice guy. Overall, would come back here if I want a quick bite and can't think of anywhere else."}
{"text":"I don't normally write negative reviews, but I feel like I have to for this little 'restaurant'.  So where to start...so many issues...  Lets start with the positive: +Wanted to try their Junction beer; waitress was nice enough to inform me that beer is terrible so don't bother.  Good.  At least she was honest.   +waitress provided overall good service, and was pleasant and helpful  Now for the negatives...the FOOD!!! Went in with a Groupon.  It was around dinner time, and there were 3 tables that were occupied.  Place was dead...    We sat down and ordered 2 appetizers: Calamari and Nachos.  Calamari came out soggy, and some pieces were still raw.  Gross.  We didn't order sushi squid.  Nachos were meh...nothing special.  Price for appetizers $24!  Next the entrees.  We ordered Steak, ribs, salmon pasta, and chicken pesto pasta.  All the food looked and tasted meh (already a compliment).  Steak was ok, nothing special. No flavor.  I imagine all this food would tasted way better at other pubs and bars.  List prices were 19+22+15+19=$75!  Not a deal for the type of quality they are serving.  Finally, the desert.  Boy oh boy.  Just when we thought food couldn't be worse, we were offered 3 types of cakes for desert - apple pie, NY cheese cake, and carrot cake.  SO we ordered NY cheese cake and carrot cake.  Deserted looked and tasted like they have been sitting around for a couple of days.  It was nasty.  Cheese cake looked and tasted dry.  We took a few bites of the carrot cake.  All the while, we were looking for traces of mold.  I half jokingly told my kids and wife that if any one of us had to get our stomach pumped due to food poisoning, we would sue this place. $12 asking price for desert.  Junction Bar is certainly NOT even worth the amount I paid for the Groupon.  Wish I had known this before I bought the darn thing.  I will never, ever go there again.  Everyone should stay away from this place."}
{"text":"Amazing place by my work, I've been there a few times now and the specials are great. I tried the jerk chicken poutine and it was excellent, definitely getting it next time I go there. Amazing specials for appetizers are great and they have a lot of drink specials. I am definitely recommending this to all my work friends!"}
{"text":"This was really terrible. We ordered nachos and they took around 30 mins to come. When they did they were small, with very little toppings, cheese that was melted in some places and not in others, and not nearly enough dipping salsa and sour cream. Guacamole was not blended properly, so large chunks of onion. I ordered the wings. They took another 45 minutes to an hour to come. Sauce was ok, but they were all deformed. Some were unrecognizable. Some had large burn marks. Not cooked fully through. My dining companion got the spaghetti chicken parm. Spaghetti tasted like crappy store bought spaghetti with sauce that nobody looked forward to their mom making. Service was atrocious. Not attentive. Didn't fill up my water glass once.   Get it together or you will cease to be."}
{"text":"I've stopped by a few times now.  Very friendly wait staff and their food recommendations were spot on.  There are enough TVs in the back to show all the games. I've had the pizza and the P.L.A.T sandwich, both of which are really good.  The portions are big enough for any hungry appetite. The menu has been carefully thought out so that you don't have your typical deep-fried bar food selection.  The bruschetta with ricotta was light and tasty, and I'll be sure to order the grilled calamari again. I can't wait for the patio to open!"}
{"text":"Came here for game six of the raptors nets series. It is in an industrial Plaza. It has a huge patio that would be nice for summer. It is pretty big inside but not that many people were there, which took away from the playoff atmosphere. However at least I didn't have to stand around waiting for a table. They had half price apps and 5 dollar Labatt pints on raptors' game nights. My girl got the pint but it was flat so they gave us pints of whatever beer we wanted until they changed the keg. We ordered the jerk chicken poutine and nachos. The nachos unfortunately were burned in a lot of spots. Also we weren't finished eating it and they took it away. It was awkward to tell them not to. The jerk chicken poutine had an interesting  taste. It wasn't amazing but not terrible. Had a white sauce on it that complimented it pretty well. Minus taking the nachos away, the service was actually pretty good. The waitress was really nice. I think they need to promote a bit more and expand the menu to get a bigger clientele. It could be a great spot in the future. 2.5 stars"}
{"text":"Went here after work on a friday night, they have specials every day, friday was sapporo for about 5$. The food prices were also very fair (picture attached) our server was what really made our experience delightfully memorable. Chico was really helpful from the moment my friend and i walked in. He told us about the daily specials, and recommendations on the best items on the menu, he always checked back with us frequently enough that our glasses were always filled, and that every thing up to par. He was definitely the highlight of our experience, not to mention his amazing sense of humor."}
{"text":"The full rack of Baby Back Ribs came with a coleslaw and the sweet potato fries. These sweet potato fries were so skinny and crunchy! I really enjoyed these. (But still not worth the extra two bucks.)  The coleslaw was a good combination with the ribs. The baby back ribs were actually delicious! There was just enough sauce on the ribs and it was tasty. It also was a little over-grilled though but it take away from the overall taste.  It was a lot of food for me and I ended up packing up my share to enjoy later at home."}
{"text":"Average bar with no vibe.  Not much character to the place, basically just drywall with laminate bar top. Menu a mish mash of dishes, none of which are exceptional."}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday evening, place wasn't busy only a couple other tables were taken. Very friendly service, was told that for a limited time, ALL MENU ITEMS ARE HALF OFF (Anniversary special) I'm like WHAT?!?!? ALRIGHT!! GOOD!!  I got the chicken quesadilla. There was not enough cheese and not enough chicken, but was jam packed with vegetables. I got fries on the side with gravy. Fries were so-so (bit salty)   My BF got the full rack ribs combo (comes with full rack ribs, cornbread, fries, and coleslaw).  Full rack ribs - serving size good. Pretty good fall-off-the-bone ribs  Coleslaw, cornbread - good i guess  Fries - a bit salty  What could be a huge turn-off is the wait time for your food to arrive. We waited at least 30 mins for our food to arrive, and I have seen another couple on another table already starting to look quite anxious since their food hasn't arrived yet.  The restaurant is spacious, got TVs, and it sits in a very nice location.  I would go back ONLY because of the HALF OFF everything promo. Otherwise, this restaurant doesn't really stand out for me."}
{"text":"Saw the deal on Groupon and decided to give it a try. Walked into this large but empty restaurant with a sign saying \"please seat yourself\" at the door. Service was alright. Server always had a big smile on when serving us but overheard her gossiping with her coworkers.  (very very loud!)  Pull pork potato skin was surprisingly tasty but I wish they had put in some vinaigrette to balance out taste from the potato skin. Shrimp and pea linguine looked ugly. I expected to see them serving whole shrimps but instead they chopped off into pieces. Most importantly, the whole plate had no taste/flavour. I had to add salt and pepper in order to finish it. We also ordered a full rack of ribs. Rib itself looked good but the fries wasn't crispy and tasted like it sat in the oven for the longest time. We ordered sundae for dessert, half melted when it was served.   Won't come back for food, might come for a beer."}
{"text":"The Junction Kitchen & Bar is located in an industrial area right at Markham and Scarborough border.  I went here with a group of friends on a Sunday evening and the venue was completely dead.  There were only two other tables during our time there and you sort of wonder how they are surviving.  I can only assume their business is great during the lunch hours on a weekday.  The menu selection is similar to a typical sports bar, but the choices are relatively limited.  I ordered a Salmon salad for dinner as I was not too hungry after a BBQ and ordered grilled calamari and sweet potato fries to share.  The Salmon Salad comes with mixed greens, oven dried tomatoes (I asked them to remove it), avocado and salmon filet topped with a lime salad dressing.  The salad was average, the dressing was decent and it blended well with the salmon and make the salad taste kind of fresh.  The calamari and sweet potato fries on the other hand, were below average.  The venue is HUGE with a huge projector television at the back (for World Cup/Sports), a live band stage set up and a pool table.  What impressed me the most is this huge photo they put up on the side of the restaurant wall, the photo  has one big star player from each soccer team in the world cup and I could not resist myself from taking a picture of it.  Overall, I think this restaurant was below average, but if there is a game night and you would like to go to a place with a big projector, that will have spaces without making reservation and do not want to travel too far, then this place would be sufficient.  But if you are looking to sit down and enjoy a nice dinner, maybe another place would be a better option."}
{"text":"Formerly VIVA CITY, the Junction Bar has been opened for less than a year under new management.  Firstly its close proximity to a lot of work places make this place a viable go-to place for after work drinks and grub.   The place is quite spacious, it makes you wonder WOW what's the capacity of this place.  However nonethless there's plenty of seating in the front where the pizza station and in the back where the bar and pool table, and stage are. They've got daily specials from beers and grub so there's plenty of food options everyday.   For starters we had their Jalapeno poppers; which was about a 2/5; the size of the actual peppers was small and it seemed as though the food was microwaved.  After finishing off my pint of Stella, our food wait-time was long and though our server was apologetic and sweet its unfortunate that this was a bad first impression as a business. I had their Sandwich special served with a house salad on the side. Presentation was nice, however the quality and taste was mediocre.    Overall the service was lovely, however the quality of food is not to standards. On the brightside if you're looking for a great sports venue, this is the place to come for drinks, and a some okay-food."}
{"text":"I'm a hospitality individual, so I am normally very understanding and patient when something goes wrong. The staff are usually doing their best and sometimes, bad things just happen. But this place was 100% the WORST managed place I have ever been to. Where do I even begin?  So in advance we had let them know that there would be approximately 40 of us coming to the Junction, because the band playing that night was a friend who was celebrating his birthday. We arrive and we don't even get a smile or a \"welcome\" or even an offer to be seated. We find our own large table with some friends/families and sit down.  Water does not arrive until 1 hour later. On top of that, our server, a middle eastern ish man in maybe his 40's/50's, tells us they don't serve hot water......... I ask another guy and he happily goes \"ofcourse we have hot water.. we're a restaurant\"...   We tell the manager in the blue shirt and the short blond hair and this guy goes \"you got to understand, you reserved for 40 but you're not even sitting in the same area. so my servers are mixed up and things are slow. I'm just saying you have to understand\". NO. we do not HAVE to understand. I would if you didn't say it in such a horrible tone of voice. First off, how are we all suppose to fit in that area?! It was tiny! so we were spread along. Second, how are you MIXED UP? Theres only one party here, theres hardly any other guests because its pretty much just our people, and you're now telling me you can't handle having guests seated in the tables that YOU have set out. If you can't handle a small party like us, then how are you a \"fun bar for young people\"? This tells me that they normally don't have any business.. nevermind the jerk server telling us that they're broke anyway. Well no wonder. you have a horrible manager who can't come up with simple solutions and then blames the guests.   We tell the server we will need separate bills as we are multiple families sitting all in this giant row of a table that THEY set up. He goes \"Why!? Why do you sit together if you don't plan on billing together\" and he is dead serious about this too.   Server RELUCTANTLY takes our order 1 hour later. OH and food gets here another 45 minutes later and he gets it wrong, which normally I'm pretty forgiving because people make mistakes and I get it. But he ARGUES WITH US. and rolls his eyes and everything. so fine. whatever. we wait patiently for our food to FINALLY come.   OH best of all, when I lift up the hot water cup and tell him we would like a refill when he has a moment, he says again that they don't have hot water...   Forget about getting the bill. that took another 30 minutes. We were there so long I could probably have knit a scarf, a sweater, and matching mittens. HORRIBLE. so obviously, he's a jerk that whole time too, but as we're getting change to pay, he suddenly gives us his first smile. TIPS. Oh don't worry, he got NONE. Forget it. I have had servers mix up my orders, forget my orders, get too flustered, etc, and I have been understanding because it happens and we're only human. I'm very forgiving. But when you actually TALK to us like we're just annoying little ticks on your back and you roll your eyes at us every time you talk to us, you can expect to NOT BE TIPPED. And your manager is a massive jerk who obviously cannot handle his job. Can't even serve a restaurant thats not even fully seated yet. Good luck if you guys ever do get popular.   I can honestly say with 100% certainty, that this place is horrible in service, in food, and their prices are WAYYY too high for food of that quality. The manager should be replaced as he was honestly the worst. He had no tolerance for questions, didn't respect us as people, and gave us excuses about how it's our fault he's busy, and their service staff need to be re-evaluated. I would never return."}
{"text":"Went there today for the first time. I had a groupon so I decided to try it out with a friend. It was for 1 appetizer (max 15$), 2 entrees (max 50$) and 1 dessert (max 14$).  The environment was nice. We weren't greeted when we entered we had to stand there cluelessly for a few minutes before someone came up. A waitress was working at a station next to us but didn't even look up to greet us. The guy who seated us was alright, didn't seem very enthusiastic but whatever.   We got the pulled pork potato skins for a starter and the entrees where baby back ribs full rack and the seafood pasta. The portions where good for the original price.  I really liked the starter, and the food tasted good as well. I was quite satisfied with the quality and portion. We didn't get an option on dessert, they only had 2 options on the menu but the guy serving us didn't ask. He just brought out a slice of royal chocolate fudge cake (another person posted a pic of it on Yelp). It's not worth it for 7$ (original price) but since it came with the groupon it was alright.   Overall, food was good, might visit again if I'm in the area. Only downside is their customer service. There were only 2 people out front so We had long wait times for someone to tend to our table even though there where only a couple of tables of people. 3.5 stars for the good food but customer service needs improvement."}
{"text":"I've decided to up my review as the manager or owner does make a big effort to provide great customer service to unsatisfied diners, and because of this I'd like to give this restaurant another try. Haven't eaten here again but will soon."}
{"text":"As a yelper who speaks the truth, this place has absolutely unacceptable service.  We had a party of 40 and reserved seats weeks prior, therefore they should have been well prepared for the big party. Instead, they are flustered and are angry at us for bringing so many people.  I'm sorry?! Excuse you! You shouldn't have agreed to taking in so many people then. Not only that! They were also really angry that we were doing split bills! You run a restaurant, you should be prepared to take that request in. It's awful that they not only say 'why?' But also give us lots of attitude.   After getting seated, they don't bother giving us any water and we didn't even get menus until a half hour later. The water didn't come until I got fed up of asking about 30 times and I had to personally go up to the bar and ask for the manager for water. He then had the audacity to tell me about our situation that we had such a huge party that he had to pull our party apart and not have us sit together and then he added that his servers are now confused! Well it is MY job to tell you to calm the eff down (excuse my language) and try to talk to your waiters? No!!!!!!! You need to calm down and just deal with it; how are u a manager?  Let me continue with my very unimpressed review.... I had to actually waiter my own table. HOW RIDICULOUS DOES THAT SOUND? I have never done this in my life... And people actually thanked me. Yes I don't know everyone at my table...    I'm deeply unimpressed. Its a 0.5 star for me.... I don't even know where I got 0.5 for.. They should just shut down. Seriously. Done"}
{"text":"Raptor Game Night Special is a sweet deal especially if you a cocktail drinker! All regular and signature cocktails for $5 when the regular price for $10! All appetizers half price!  We shared some apps and drink some spicy cocktails... and cheering on the Raptors!    All for $5 during Appy Hour: Watermelon Fizz ($7) The Junction ($10) Jalapeno infused tequila Junction Signature Caesar ($10) with Bacon Infused Vodka  All Half Price during Appy Hour: Jerk Chicken Poutine ($8) Pulled Pork Potato Skins ($10) Calamari ($11)  Special of the Day: Corn Battered Fish Sandwich ($9)  Pool for $1.50 a game ...  Service was attentive and excellent!  Since The Junction Kitchen & Bar was relatively new, there were a lot of things they were quite unsure. Sound was on mute during Raptor games until we requested to have it turned on. Management kept playing with the remote control during the game.. those all should be sorted out prior the beginning of the game!   Beer special was a little weak with only Labbatt Blue for $5 a pint... .. I guess I would stick with my foo foo drinks"}
{"text":"I've tried this place before when it was called Viva City. I didn't like it at all back then so I was pleased to find out that it's under new management.   I tried the fried chicken and rice. It was OK. Mediocre. Portion was small. Price expensive. No free drink refills.   I will probably go again, but it will be as a last resort."}
{"text":"I'll keep this short, because this place doesn't deserve for me to waste anymore of my time on them...after waiting close to an hour for our lunch(yes it was busy but cmon) they have the audacity to place a meatball sandwich with moldy mozzarella cheese on it in front of me. The server then states that it's not mold(this before I even say anything) then rushes off. Chico comes by, attempts to cut it off(yes, like I'm going to eat the f'en thing?) then rushes off to the kitchen after I berate him. Told us our iced teas were no charge(seriously, like I'm paying you?). I can assure the mgmt, I will not return, and with over 500 folks in my office a block away, well, you know what comes next..bad advertising..."}
{"text":"We had a work function at this restaurant today.  There were 12 of us in total.  The service, ambiance, and food were merely okay. I ordered the pulled pork pizza and it was a good size for the money   The pizza only cost $10.  The massive amount of extremely vinegary bbq sauce was a bit too much. The thin crust and the cheese, as well as the quality of the pulled pork were all quite good.  I expected the crust to have a more baked texture however even though I know it was baked it almost seemed fried?  One of my coworkers ordered the macaroni and was very happy with it.  Another ordered the hamburger and was not very satisfied.  Two of my coworkers ordered chicken wraps and received turkey wraps instead and thus were quite frustrated.  Overall the meal was merely okay."}
