{"text":"We came here with a group of 8 around 5pm, not a busy time. As soon as I got a bite out of the food I felt like I was in India. I could tell the spices they used in their dishes were not from here. The food was tasty and spicy. I ordered vegetable fried dumplings for an appetizer- they were not what I expected. But as soon as I tried everything else I was amazed. They also made everything without onion and garlic- another plus. The service was alright. They brought the food out quickly. But did not come back to our table at all to check for a re-fill on drinks or clear our table of any extra plates. If you love indo-Chinese it's definitely a restaurant worth coming back to."}
{"text":"Love the variety of the different cuisines.  Fresh and delicious vegetable!  Every dish customized to your preference of spiciness.  Try a mango lassi, refreshing!"}
{"text":"Great Indo Chinese restaurant. Its is worth going from Charlotte. Loved Chicken Manchuria and drumsticks."}
{"text":"Well, surprising food in a surprising place. Since we've been here, we've been looking for a new favorite Chinese place that compared to where we are from. We've eaten at nearly all of the Chinese places in Gastonia searching for a spot we could frequent without having to wonder if we tried anything new, would it actually be good.   Our previous Chinese place in Virginia had some out-of-this-world General Tso's chicken and so far nothing has even come close to what we would like. This place....it's oh so very close it's scary. Certainly far surpassing any other General Tso's chicken in Gastonia.   We plan to try more things from the menu , so far we loved both dishes we ordered. We equally shared our plates with each other because they were both great.    Atmosphere was ok. The staff was great. Super polite...and most of all, genuine.   We got some to-go menus on our way out the door, will be perfect for Sunday football order out dinners"}
{"text":"I placed an order for takeaway. The reviews looked good so I thought I'd check it out. Ordered the fried chicken dumplings as an appetizer. They are pretty good, especially with the dipping sauce but nothing special. I ordered the Mongolian beef which had good flavor but the beef was TERRIBLE!!! There were big, thick chunks that were so chewy that my jaw hurt and I still couldn't even chew them down. I'm not going to write this place off just yet but I'm definitely not getting anything with beef again! The beef was so bad that I went to 2 stars, not a single piece was tender. I think the same dish with chicken might have been good coz you can't go wrong with chicken right?"}
{"text":"Have entrees on menu from China, India, Thailand and Japan.  Just tried hot and sour soup and Thai peanut wings.  Looking forward to trying other things"}
{"text":"I have been looking for something to satisfy my recent food craving. I am sick of the regular bland food I've been having. WE FOUND IT!!! We came here with high hopes and it was better than expected. We had the Mongolian Paneer, Indian Curry Chicken & Hot & Sour soup. All were very good. We hope to bring others with us next time because we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Some friends and I have been missing great fusion food ever since Fu Lin closed in Charlotte.  We stumbled upon this place and after getting our dishes, we felt confident that we found a sufficient replacement as the flavors brought back nostalgia.  Thats when it happened.  My friend saw the owner/chef of Fu Lin come out of the kitchen!  So ecstatic he decided to get back into the business and open this place.  The food is unique, flavorful, fresh and always satisfying.  You can order Indian, Chinese, Thai or a fusion of them off the menu.  It is worth noting that every dish has a vegetarian version with paneer, cauliflower or tofu- so anyone can partake in the wonderfully flavored sauces and curries.  Don't worry vegans you are covered too!  Definitely worth the drive."}
{"text":"Food was great, decent portions, fresh and hot. It would be nice to have a menu someplace online."}
{"text":"This is awesome I had the pan fried noodles o m g it's a must a lot lot of food  wow please stop by and the lettuce rap o my my"}
{"text":"Nice addition to the neighborhood. Been there 3 time now and a good meal each time. My wife loved the vegetarian meals on the menu.  Also finally a place that when you ask for spicy you get it. So many places don't give you spicy even when you asked for it. Looking forward to trying more on the menu"}
{"text":"Had lunch here yesterday with a friend. We were the only customers when we got there and when we left. That should have been a clue. The waiter bless his heart was as dry as chalk and several times I had to motion him over for a refill of water. The food was not good at all. The only thing I could eat was the crab ragoons. During our lunch we encountered a flying type of insect buzzing around our head and table. It landed in the window I took off my flip flop and smushed it. Then there was a battle with what I guess were gnats. We had very large aggressive dirt dobber visit our table several times. The kicker was when we were getting up to leave we saw a live spider on our table about the size of a nickel. With each bug we were swatting and I told our waiter about all the bugs and he never said a word. What was most surprising is that who I believe was the owner was sitting at the booth next to us chatting with a male who was not eating. I feel like he should have asked us if we were in need of something or apologize for all the bugs, but he never even acknowledged us. When you encounter 4 different types of bugs at one sitting there is a problem. I could not eat my food so it was a waste of time and money. I had so much look forward to eating here, sadly I will not be back nor recommend it."}
{"text":"If beef and broccoli is the measure of any Asian restaurant, this place hits it out of the park! Portions are sensible the price is cheap and the food is fucking delicious!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here for the first time yesterday. We came here on the recommendation of a coworker (thanks Roshan). The food was awesome.  The staff was very polite and genuine. She and my wife struck up a conversation about pants my wife was wearing. :)    Anyway, we each got soup, Hot Sour for me and Egg Drop for my wife. A big bowl of soup arrives shortly after and both were excellent They came with some of those fried wonton strips too. For my meal I ordered the Manchurian Steak (the menu says chicken, but you can substitute steak for $1.00).  I ordered it extra spicy. Sandi got the Teriyaki Steak. Her comments were that the veggies were hot and crisp, and the flavor very good. Everything was also cut a bit smaller than expected, and pleasantly so.   The Manchurian Steak was really nice.  The spice for me could have been kicked up a few more notches, but I really like hot and spicy foods. It's only a matter of a few more visits before they learn me. The meals also came with a choice of white or fried rice.  We both took the fried rice and it was nicely done as well.   So over all we give them 5 stars and more of our business!  Thank you Tang Lin for a really nice meal."}
{"text":"Food and service are great.  Never sat down to eat always have carry out.  I have not been disappointed since coming here 6 months ago.  I am very selective about my Asian food.  Try it you can thank me later."}
{"text":"Horrible experience, horrible food.  How much expanding do I need to go into?  Waitress did. Pt know what she was doing.  And upon reflection, neither does their cook (no chef there)."}
{"text":"Fantastic food!  This place was a complete surprise and a total delight.  Looking through the menu can be a bit overwhelming since there is so much to choose from, but I have yet to have a bad item or experience."}
{"text":"What a great find in West Gastonia!  The menu has 4 different types of cuisine and the portions are huge!  Excellent food quality and service."}
