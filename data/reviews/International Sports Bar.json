{"text":"Amazing food and great staff!! I love the live music on the weekends aswell. I am a regular here and highly recommend it. I also read every review and saw someone say the place was closed down. That is completely un-true as I would have known it closed since I have been going there very often for almost a year now. I have spoken with the owner several times and the chefs they are all very friendly. I also actually seen them wash their hands multiple times as there is a hand washing station you are able to see from the side of the bar."}
{"text":"I heard about this Portuguese restaurant from a co-worker who insisted that they have the best Bife a Casa (steak with a fried egg on top with a sauce and potatoes). I would call this place a sports bar - there are tv screens with soccer or other sports on and there is a bar at the back with regular Portuguese men having beer but it is a restaurant with clothed tables. The bife a Casa is soooo good we have never tried anything else off the menu.  I finish the whole thing and the portion is very generous. The red house wine is also very good.  Always leave happy after dining here."}
{"text":"I was here to watch a soccer game on sunday afternoon. chicken wings arrived extremely dry. It must have been over fried. And server looked like clearly not want to be there on sunday. so don't expect a smile."}
{"text":"This place has quickly become one of my favorite places to eat Portuguese food.  So far all of the foods I have tried have been amazing (the octopus is a definite favorite!) The service is usually pretty good and on the weekends they have live music.  Prices are reasonable and portion sizes are good.  Lots of parking right outside."}
