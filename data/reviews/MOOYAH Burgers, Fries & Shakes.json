{"text":"Excellent burger place! I don't like five guys because the burgers are always soggy, mooyahs were just the right amount of juicy. Fries, fresh buns, and shakes were awesome too. Good quality ingredients and friendly staff"}
{"text":"A coworker told me to come here. Drove all the way from far east side. It was so worth it. Me and my friend wanted to try everything. Burgers are giant. Frys too. The shakes were great too. I like how soft the ice cream was. 

Now the reason I downloaded this app to sign up and leave this review. Lucas. He made this visit amazing. He brought us our shakes first. The shakes were not labled so me and my friend's were switched. By the time he had came back we had a both just started to drink from the wrong shakes. He offered to make new shakes. That was way over our expectations. We asked for new straws and some spoons. But thank you for offering new shakes. It did not stop here. Lucas walked the food to our table. He offered sauces and brought us a few to try. He came back tward the end of the meal and offered boxes. I asked for some more sauce and he brought another small cup of spicy ranch (best sauce ever) and a lid. Lucas made this visit amazing. There were 11 people I saw working and I'm sure they are all great. But Lucas you are awesome, keep up the great work."}
{"text":"I think this place is wonderful! This is a great concept! They make burgers to order and I love their Sweet potato  fries!"}
{"text":"Avererage burger, a bit greasy and the fries were cold.

In my opinion there are much better places for a burger, but if you are in the area and really want a burger then you could go here."}
{"text":"It's like $11 dollars for a burger, soda, and fries. 

If I could describe how the service works I would say it is like a subway with burgers. 

The fries are fresh and they're good.. real good! The burgers are really NOT good. You're a burger joint and the burgers suck every time I've been there! So bland and dry. I had saut√©ed onions on mine and I tried one on its own and it was not seasoned and soggy, it was so gross. 

By the way, it you get \"fried onions\" on it it not fresh fried onions it's the canned \"fried onions\". You know, the stuff your grandma puts on the green bean casserole? 

I think I'll just get a shake and fries whenever I go there."}
{"text":"I've tried a few different menu items so far since Mooyah opened, and I am so glad they have a veggie (black bean) burger available! The only other black bean burger I've tried was from Smashburger and I couldn't finish it because it was super hot/spicy. The Mooyah black bean burger is not like that, so my mouth was very happy with that! Their shakes are thick, and delicious. Oh, and everyone who works there is very friendly, which is always a plus! 

For those with kids, perfect place. For those looking for a fast-casual burger joint, perfect place. If you don't like crowded places or kids, maybe don't come here. But I will be back!"}
{"text":"Mooyah is located at the intersection of good food and lousy service. If you're trying to compete with Five Guys, you have to excel in something other than food quality and taste. Mooyah just hasn't found that \"thing\" yet, as clearly demonstrated during our visit. 

Sure, the restaurant was clean, the workers were friendly, blah blah blah. What frustrated me was that during our visit, the second register was not opened even though the couple in front of us was taking a long time to make up their minds. We probably stood in line a solid five minutes while three people stood behind the grill (two workers too many), and another worker was just standing around, trying (in vain) to look busy. It would not have been an issue to open another register and take our order. The man in front of us apologized, and I should have told him that it wasn't his fault that we were still standing there. 

I hope the management can train up their employees to function as a team and recognize the needs of customers, so that future visits are more pleasant. Good customer service will make Mooyah more enjoyable to visit; after all, I can get a decent cheeseburger almost anywhere."}
{"text":"When a restaurant specializes in two things only - burgers & fries, you would think they would excel.  In my opinion, this is not the case.  The burger had no flavor and the fries were greasy & limp.  Plus this new restaurant is very, very expensive for what you get.  The girl at the cash register added 70 cents to my bill for cheese when I didn't even order cheese.  The only thing positive was the customer service.  I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Giving stars for John's service. He was working the register, cleaning, and serving food. Honestly one of the nicest people I have ever encountered in my life. 
Food was good, just a little expensive. I ordered off the kids menu and it was good. Hope John is working next time I go in!"}
{"text":"Where's the beef?! I ordered a double burger and the wife had a regular Mooyah. Imagine my surprise when the food came out and the wife's single patty on her burger was larger than my two patties combined! The reason people order a double is because they want more than a single! Maybe it was an off day, but the cook should have noticed the comparison as he was preparing our order. A 1 star experience, but gave an extra star since the burger did taste good..."}
{"text":"Seriously love this place. I came here 2 days in a row! The service is excellent- everyone is friendly and cares about how you are enjoying your experience/meal. The burger was delicious! They have a wheat bun that is so good. I also got an Oreo shake that was so well made. Easily one of the best burgers I've had in the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"The service was great and everyone was friendly in a way that wasn't obnoxious. I'm not sure if that's because no one has worked there long enough to become bitter and jaded, or because it's a restaurant with appropriate levels of staffing. 

The burger and fries were good, the bun they use might be a little too big for a single burger. I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Great burgers and great fries!  I love the option to have my burger wrapped in lettuce and pick the toppings I want.  It's a bit pricey, but the food is worth it- much better burgers than Red Robin which costs just as much."}
{"text":"Last Fri.(03-11) my husband passed away at the VA hosp. In Madison WI. I stopped by your restaurant to eat before I headed back home, 70 miles, cashier was very attentive, noticed I'd been crying, inquired, I told her, placed my order, went to get my water & wait for my to go order, when the little gal brought out my order, she asked if she could give me a hug, the cashier had told her what had happen, here comes the cashier, and she gave me back my cost of my meal, saying they were paying for my mid-afternoon lunch. Thank you so very much for your thoughtfulness. I will be patronizing their establishment in the future. Thank you, thank you, thank you."}
{"text":"2 mooyah burgers, 2 small fries and 2 small shakes was $25.  Seriously?  The burgers and fries are good, not great.  The shakes are excellent.   It's ridiculously loud in there and the seating is crammed together. 

All in all, average food, below average seating and atmosphere and prices that border insanity.  Did it, done it, won't do it again."}
{"text":"Let me start with stating that the people who work here are so nice! My husband and I are new to the area and come from Milwaukee with places like Five Guys and Fuddruckers. This place is better!! I got a strawberry and banana shake that was probably one of the best I've ever had. The burger with cheese was so juicy and you can actually taste the seasoning!! 

As for the fries, you can tell that they are fresh. Baskets line the back with freshly cut potatoes, awaiting their oil bath. Seasoning on these bad boys is apparent and they like to top off your bag with some extra when you get it to go. Will definitely come here again and will bring friends when they come to visit."}
{"text":"The service was decent being that it was our first time, I recommend getting a milkshake because it is BOMBBBBBBBB the fries could use a tad more salt and the burgers were pretty good but I would probably rather go with five guys over this. All in all i would certainly come back being that its in fitchburg."}
{"text":"The only reason I did not give an additional star, is because they are reheating the fries! You are hand cutting these delicious morsels...why ruin them?   Burgers were great!"}
{"text":"Really good burgers, but super expensive!  2 kids meals, 2 double burgers, fries and drinks cost us about $37.  If they lowered their prices, we would be back often!"}
{"text":"Great, tasty, fresh burgers and an upbeat atmosphere.  I opted for the wheat bun which is soft and satisfying and loaded up the burger with fresh lettuce, tomatoes, cheddar cheese and fried onion strings.  Absolutely delicious.  The fries are nice, but a little hard in texture for some reason.  Solid burger place, fresh and good."}
{"text":"Like many of you, I'm always on the look out for an amazing burger...

To put it another way, I'm always looking for a Dean burger (any Supernatural fans here?).

Anyways, the people here were really nice and put out a decent burger. Its juicy and has nice toppings though it wasn't exceptionally flavorful, not bad though. I did get it Mooyah style. I'm being picky now but I wish the bun was a smidgen heartier too.

I didn't like the fries though (tried normal and sweet potato), not crispy :(.  The sweet potato had some sort of seasoning that I didn't get along with. I would have preferred just salt on them and let the sweet potato flavor shine. I liked the normal fries only slightly more.

Anyways, not a glowing review from me BUT I would not discourage anyone from going. Three stars is not shabby and is worth at least trying once to decide for yourself!

But for me, the Dean burger search goes on..."}
{"text":"Ew, man! My burger tasted like a hot dog, straight up. Nothing like a beef patty. It was really disgusting and I'm very disappointed. Wasted $12. My soda was good though...The jalape√±os are super delicious, but then the fries tasted like they were fried in old ass oil, soo..."}
{"text":"Solid burger place.  I went with the classic mooyah in the mooyah style and it was really good.  Plenty of food for me, no need to double it.  The fries were good too!  When I talked to the cashier to order and the guy who I picked up my food from, they were both extremely friendly and nice as well as helpful.  I'll definitely go back when I'm in that area shopping and craving a burger."}
{"text":"Honestly disappointed. Read all the good reviews and was excited to try with my husband. We hardly go out to lunch so were looking forward to something good. Staff was friendly. But the food was  just not good. Got two burgers, reg fries and sweet potato fries, Oreo shake and strawberry banana shake. Burgers were falling apart and not even patties more just like ground beef. Buns were crumbling and way too messy. Fries were ok. Forgettable. The shakes were really thick and overly sweet; weird consistency. Both got the larger size and ended up throwing most away. I don't think I've ever not finished a shake. Overall disappointing. Probably won't be back. Culvers has them beat hands down. And if you want a really good burger that's comparable in price try DLux. Best burgers and fries in town."}
{"text":"Having moved here from Texas, I really wanted to like this place! The bottom line is it's a decent burger period! I love Whataburger, Shake Shack, Habit/Smash/Fat and In and Out Burger and this has nothing to write home about.

I got an email offering 2 for 1 hot dogs so we gave it another shot. Again, meh! They served us a hot dog on a hamburger bun and laughed it off like \"that's no problem right?\"

Five Guys is consistent and has great fries and I would pick them 10 out of 10 times over Mooyah!"}
{"text":"Ate here today for the first and probably the last time. Wanted to try them since they were a new burger place. Husband and I ordered our food and went and sat down to wait for it. There was maybe 3 orders ahead of ours. 10 mins go by, no food yet. It took about 22 mins to get 2 burgers and a fry.  I Had ordered a single cheeseburger, hubby a double. My burger was the same thickness as his. There was nothing spectacular about the burgers, I could have made them at home for less than we paid there. The sweet potato fries were ok, they were hot, could have used a little more salt on them. All in all it was ok but not somewhere I would probably eat at again."}
{"text":"Done with this place, simple.  Restaurant's \"OPEN\" light on, you can see it two blocks away - but Second time in a couple weeks I've stopped within 15 mins of closing time and most of equipment was already shut off.  In addition, an insult to your paying customers to put chairs upside down on top of the tables literally all around them, tonight a friend was in there and telling me he couldn't believe it.  Like the food well enough, but done, I drove ten mins to get over there - the sign said open, but place was \"closed\" with the \"open\" light on"}
{"text":"This is a place I really want to like. So much so even though I wasn't hugely impressed the first time I went I gave it second try last weekend. The concept sounds good, the location is great, the menu looks delicious and the employees at the register are friendly. But the actual food is disappointing. It's like the food has so much potential and then lets you down. Both times I have been here I ordered a build your own burger. The bottom bun is always soggy, there is a vinegar-y aftertaste, the fried onions taste like they haven't been fried enough and the beef is just ok. Honestly, in comparison Culver's hamburgers taste better. I think because this place is primarily a burger joint and burgers are their specialty they should be impressive and they aren't. As for sides to go with your burgers the choices are too limited. It's either: regular fries, sweet potato fries or a side salad. I wish they had additional options such as cheese curds or onion rings. The shakes are good. They are probably my favorite item on the menu. I also think a soda machine that offers more choices would be a good idea. I appreciate that they offer Coke and not Pepsi products, however, some more diet soda choices other than cola would be nice."}
{"text":"I loved this place the first few times we went, but the past 3 meals I've had there have been progressively worse and I'm super disappointed. 

I mentioned in my previous review that the AC blows on the tables and cools your food faster than you can eat it. This has persisted, but now the issue is that my food is coming out already not hot, so it's ice cold within moments. I think they seem to be trying to get meals out really quickly, but it's coming at the expense of quality. The past two veggie burgers were so cold the cheese wasn't even melted on them. My daughter's grilled cheese the other night was so underdone, I could still peel the pieces of cheese out of it- not at all melted. 

Temperature aside, there are other issues-- fries have gotten even saltier to where I can't eat them. One of my burgers was SO saturated in a massive quantity of mustard one night that it disintegrated the lower bun and I had to eat 75% of it with a fork and knife. 

And what's up with staff turnover? They are CONSTANTLY training new people every time we go in there and something is wrong with our order every time because of it. The other day, I ordered a build-your-own, but instead of paying attention to the toppings I actually wanted, the cashier put in the pre-designed burger already on the menu that was closest to what I wanted--- and it wasn't what I ordered. I had to wait for a new burger to be made while the rest of my table went ahead with their meal, then I think to get it to me quickly to make up for the mess up, it wasn't heated all the way through. I wanted to just throw it in the trash and leave. Their excuse was that it was the guy's second day on the job. Ok, well, don't set someone loose solo on the register until he's trained properly. 

AND the condition of the restaurant itself is declining. The past couple times we've been there, the bathroom was a mess with overflowing garbage can, no soap in the dispenser, and grime everywhere. The crevice between the back and the seat on the very long bench was full of pieces of food and dust. Yuck. And when we moved a couple of tables together for our group, there was a bunch of food debris and garbage that came out from under the table feet. Who knows how long that was there? Napkin dispensers and ketchup bottles on the table were empty. Nobody is paying attention here. 

I think we'll take a break and go somewhere else for a while and maybe try Mooyah again at a later date to see if they sort any of this stuff out, but I'm tired of getting cold, wrong food and eating it in a messy place."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to try the new franchise in the area today.  It was difficult to find parking, but were not thinking this was because of Mooyah.  We thought we walked into utter chaos, but realized soon that this was the atmosphere and enjoyed it.  We were there to order for take out and stood in a long line to order.  The only downside to the order and pick up was the wait time for our order to come through.  We forgave this since all seating was taken when we walked in with about 20 people in front of us to order and it looked like a handful waiting for their order.  The sheer amount of orders were a little much, but there were about 12 employees behind the counter so they were doing their best to keep up.

Now to the food.  We always rate our food based on what the restaurant is and not compared to any different styles of eatery.  Compared to all burger places we have eaten, this had the best sweet potato fries I have eaten.  I love sweet potato fries and don't think that I have ever had bad ones anywhere I have had them.  Mooyah puts some extra spice on that gives an extra kick to the fries.  You could taste the sweetness of the potato on the front end and a little kick on the back end that almost seemed like a Cajun-type spice.

The made to order burgers were excellent as well. The buns were fresh and delicious and everything was tasty.  The only downside for me is the pressing down of the burger.  To a grillers, this loses a lot moisture, but speeds up cook time.  The burger itself was flavorful so a little less moisture was compensated by the flavor and the BBQ sauce I had on mine.

I would definitely recommend and would have given it a 5 star if we would have chosen a less busy time.  My 4-star is really a 4 1/2 star."}
{"text":"Currently my favorite burger in Madison...they have an iceberg lettuce \"bun\" option. don't let the inexpensive price fool you. Top quality food...super attentive staff. Excellent customer service. Fries are amazeballs...large portions."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and the Burgers are Awesome!  My kids love the shakes...
Drop by and try!"}
{"text":"Decent fast food burger, option of gluten-free bun or lettuce-wrap for the burger was nice. Good taste, nice selection/menu."}
{"text":"I love the selections that they have. The issues were the young lady taking our order chewed on her fingers constantly. She also suggested due to our size that my husband and I needed a large order to share. On top of the attitude my burger and the fries were over salted. I will definitely not be returning."}
{"text":"Finally a fast fresh burger place that  has everything you want in a good burger, in just the style you want it.  I had the pleasure of devouring a double cheeseburger from this place with some sweet potato fries. The buns are fresh and soft and make the whole burger just that much better, in addition to the fact that you can build your own personalized burger experience.  Skip the greasy bag from five guys and head on over to this place."}
{"text":"I have to disagree with Andrew F. Who reviewed this place earlier.  Maybe it was opening week or something.

I just reviewed Five Guys (on State St) the other week (gave them a 2) and this place is at least 3 times better.  In fact everything is better including ordering, the topping items, the fries and of course the burger.

Ordering was easier as you don't have to figure out the difference between a regular vs little burger, they list them as a single or a double, no cuteness. And there are more toppings and of better quality too.  The mushrooms for example are actually saut√©ed vs the \"out of a can\" at 5 guys.  Then you give your name and sit at a clean table vs having to stand around the trash can at 5 guy's (catching a theme here? I REALLY didn't like 5 Guys).

The food came out on trays (vs a greasy paper bag at that other place) and wow, really looked great!  Tasted even better.  The bun was very fresh and solid enough to stand up to the juicy burger and ample toppings (unlike the crappy whimsy bun you get at that \"other\" place).  The mushrooms and fried straw onions were fantastic!  The fries were good too, cut fresh from potatoes just like at that \"other\" place except here they were cooked perfectly and not a mound of grease like at that \"other\" place.

The only reason for a 4 vs 5 star, is that the prices were a bit high for having to stand in line, taking a number etc, and I need total perfection for a 5."}
{"text":"Walk through the doors and the wonderful aroma of excellent burgers gets you salivating right away. WAIT... Josh is on the grill... even better!!! Friendly, welcoming, courteous and ready to feed you! If you haven't been there, you are missing out"}
{"text":"Got our office lunch from Mooyah today and I have to say I'm impressed! All the orders were correct, assembled correctly, in each individual labeled bags. When I arrived to pick up the large order, the manager apologized for a slight delay for the fries because they wanted us to have the freshest, warm, crispiest fries possible! They even offered me a fountain soda to 'compensate' for their good intentions.

The large windows added welcoming sunlight during this visit. Terrific staff, and lively atmosphere. 

We all got different versions of the burgers with having both white and multi-grain (they also offer lettuce wrapped), loaded with different toppings (additional meat, cheese, bacon and avocados are the only extra $!), and all reported back satisfactory.

I personally liked the white buns better than the multi-grain, the multi-grain had a sweet flavor and distracted from the juicy, lean, savory burger patties.

The burger patties are what I would describe as a little more thicker than Culver's, but not as wide like Red Robin's. The beef patty are advertised as 100% lean and never frozen, and you can definitely taste it in the uncompromising beef. 

I elected to get the sweet potato fries with my order ($0.50 more than regular fries) and it was a good bet, crispy outside and cooked throughout, none of that limp-y nonsense. The small order of fries was plenty for me, served in a small to-go drink cup, I still have some leftover for a snack later. Try dipping them in the Mooyah sauce (a runnier Thousand Island)!

It is a la cart ordering system, so you are surpassing Culver's in cost, but comparable to Five Guy's."}
{"text":"The employees are so nice here!

I ordered to-go, and after taking my order they informed me that they will make the fries when I get there, \"so that they can be the freshest when you get here\". *Yaaas*

You walk in and are greeted with a smile. You pay for your order and watch as they announce for your potato to meet their oily demise, well not really, they are actually cooked flawlessly.

The burgers patties are hearty, not thin like Culver's but more comparable to Five Guys, and always cooked to perfection!

This place is my destination to carbload after an shopping day at the Super Target, located in the same parcel."}
{"text":"So nice to have a delicious burger place! Very tasty and many options to try. Owner and staff are super nice. Fries are so good and love the presentation!
I order a double for my two little ones to share  and they are so nice to cut it in half and serve it separately. 
Miss In-N-Out but this place rocks!
Get the app for points :)"}
{"text":"I went here previously with my wife and it was manageable, and we enjoyed it for the most part. We decided to go back with her children hoping for the same experience. To are disappointment it was anything but that. My wife ordered fried onions on her Burger but never received it, so we then asked for it and the lady there gave us an attitude. We didn't think it was a big deal to ask for something that we already initially asked for and never received. And even after all of that we got charged extra for the fried onions that we had already paid for. As for my children, they enjoyed their burgers and I am pleased about that. Mooyah please just make sure that your employees have kindness in their heart, because customer service plays a big role in whether someone comes back or not. Thank you"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of taking three wee ones for milkshakes to MOOYAH on McKee while their mom was giving birth to their baby brother. The staff was interactive with kids, offering more M & M's, providing travel lids. Then as it turned out, I misplaced the van keys and accidentally left the lights on. So in the cold weather, manager Gabby and her staff helped me entertain the kids. She looked for the keys in the trash. Twice. She even helped me scoure the van looking for the keys which were eventually found. Oh, yes, they even helped jump start the van. Best fries and outstanding service! Baby Huck was born within the hour of our return. Bravo Gabby!"}
{"text":"The food here is wonderful and the price is fair I particularly enjoyed the sweet potato fries. I also like the fact that you build your burger"}
{"text":"Love Mooyah so much. My favorite is a burger with American cheese, saut√©ed onions, fried onions, and spicy ranch on their wheat option. Both fry options are tasty (especially when the normal ones are extra crispy and accompanied by a side of Mooyah sauce). 

The wait can be kinda long. 

And while it has become a bit of a game, it seems there is not a single employee who knows how to spell \"Katie\" in the most popular way-- 9 times out of 10 it ends up being \"Katty\" which becomes quite comical when the employee at the end calls my name."}
{"text":"First time visiting and I brought my kids. The food was delicious and fresh and the service was amazing"}
{"text":"Second visit tonight and we are sad to say not going to return. The prices are high for what you get. They have both times served incorrect items causing one person to sit waiting for food. My children love the shakes so maybe for desert or a treat."}
{"text":"This place recently opened up and I've been wanting to try it ever since a friend raved about it.  And now I'm going to rave about it.  

The burgers were excellent.  Made fresh- you can watch them make your burger.  And the possibilities for topping combos are endless.  I got the Mooyah sauce on mine- yummy.  Similar to a Thousand Island dressing.  I also got some medium fries and were a big fan of those as well.  Hand cut potato fries, lightly salted, not too greasy.  

What makes this place different than 5 Guys is they offer MORE.  More vegetarian options.  Dessert options.  And in my mind, you get more bang for your buck taste wise.  5 Guys is too greasy overall.  Mooyah's burgers had some grease, but it's what you'd expect from a burger.  5 Guys is too greasy.  

I'm planning on going back to get another burger and to try a shake!"}
{"text":"I went to MOOYAH because my friend told me about a deal where you download the restaruant's app and get a free burger...one of the main reasons I give 4 stars rather than the average 3. The MOOYAH burger was overall satisfying and not too greasy. I got the white bun which is more \"legit\" bread rather than a cheap hamburger bun that you might find at McDonalds or Culvers. The beef patty was very similar to that of Culvers. There are a lot of toppings you can get for no extra charge (including the shoestring onions which add a nice extra crunch to the burger), though cheeese and avocado are extra. This is a great place for a quick stop if you are craving a burger."}
{"text":"Burger was good as were the fries.  Portion size is more than I usually eat in one sitting.  The ice cream / milkshakes are the reason to go.  Get in there and enjoy.  Save room for dessert...."}
{"text":"Went to Mooyah today while strolling up and down state Street, it's alot like five guy's. The Mooyah burger was juicy and the fries were some of the best I have tasted especially with the cheese sauce I was pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, and I'm always pretty satisfied with my experience here. I get really flustered with the menu probably due to the fact I'm used to restaurants having signature burger. But if you really like custom burgers this place is the place to go. I've tried the classic Mooyah burger, with just a patty and a bun and whatever toppings I wanted with the Mooyah sauce, which is really good! And I've also tried the classic patty with wrapped in iceberg lettuce. There are pros and cons to both. The normal bun makes you fuller a lot faster so you may not be able to enjoy the delicious fries & the bun is usually the worst part of a burger (but if you're going to Mooyah in the first place-you're probably not THAT calorie concerned) but its easier to eat. The ice burger feels fresh but its harder to keep the toppings from falling out which can get annoying. Lastly the strawberry shakes are so so good here. Thinking about them just makes me to want to run there right now. This place is a little pricey, and I definitely have had better burgers at other places but it's pretty good. I'm a fan"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at a MOOYAH anywhere but will definitely not be my last; I stopped with my mother as we were passing through town and we were greeted by the owner Randy who welcomed us and even served us our food.

I can't say enough about the quality of the food as it was fresh and very tasty and it was served quickly using fresh ingredients. Even the French fries are cut from real potatoes and you could see the buns being made fresh in the oven behind the counter.

The price was very affordable for the quality and it seemed to be a great atmosphere for the whole family.

I would highly recommend MOOYAH - Fitchburg to anyone looking for a tasty and affordable dining-out experience."}
{"text":"Terrific high end fast food.  Staff was polite and friendly. Good burgers and fries. Shakes were not so greAt"}
{"text":"It's good for what it is, I'm not a meat connoisseur so I can't judge much about the meat however my teenager is a Red Meat Bandit so her opinion of the burgers is HIGH as she always HOLD 5Guys as Top Burger until she had MooYah. She stated that this burger is the in a TIE if not leading 5Guy burger. I for one do appreciate the BlackBean Garden Burger option as it is served between iceberg lettuce with a spicy mayo and swiss cheese. The fries are fresh cut which is always a plus and the staff is friendly. I did have one issue this past weekend when my family and I checked this place out (took my husband and toddler for the first time). My son had the children tenders and he kept pushing them away saying NO and I continued to try to break them up to feed him and while breaking one up my finger got slimey and it was like some slime inside the tender which was so GROSS, it looked horribly disgusting. So basically it's not Chick-Fil-A tenders, the manager was great at accessing the issue and offering something else which we opted out of the chicken as we don't usually get chicken tenders out (besides Chick-Fil-A once in a blue moon) and asked for a grill cheese as you can't go wrong with a grill cheese with cheddar cheese.
The wall BlackBoard is cool, it's a HUGE chalkboard wall and there is a huge silver bucket with chalk in it for doodling while waiting."}
{"text":"We were doing some shopping in Matthews and stumbled upon Mooyah when we were looking for something small to eat.  I was pleased to see that Mooyah let you pick whatever kind of burger you wanted (be it beef, turkey, veggie, or even hot dog) and then pile whatever you wanted onto it without nickel-and-diming you for every item.  Forget Burger King, this is truly \"Have it your way.\"  

I opted for something spicy, so I picked the turkey burger with Buffalo sauce, chunky blue cheese, jalapenos, and crispy onions.  Instead of a bun, I tried the lettuce wrap version.  What I got was something amazing.  The burger was very flavorful, and all of my selected toppings complemented one another.  The crispy onions gave it some crunch.  My lettuce \"wrap\" was several layers of iceberg lettuce on either side of the burger, forming its own \"bun.\"  Everything about it was perfect.  Since we were eating \"light,\" we didn't try any sides, like the French fries, but they looked awesome from what we saw on other tables.  They looked fresh cut with the skins on.  

It was such a nice day that nobody was eating inside the restaurant (although they have a good size dining room).  Everyone was enjoying eating outdoors, which they have plenty of seating for.  

We'll definitely go back when we're shopping in that area.  The prices and food were both great.  I'm not going to lie, though.  I'm probably going to get the exact same thing because it was such a delicious combination."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! The burgers are fresh made-to-order, and you have an ingredient list of at least 15 add one! Fries are perfect, not mushy or over salted. The also provide veggie burger options, and a variety of shakes. The Mooyah burger is a must try!!!"}
{"text":"Always a treat going to Mooyah.  Never heard of it until it opened and tried it and just love the burgers.  The fries are always hot and done perfect for me.  I love the Chocolate Shake for a treat once in a while.  Staff is nice.  I like the atmosphere of the place.  Sometimes the owner comes out and checks on the customers and talk to them."}
{"text":"3 times and all have been Great,  I can not wait to try the IceBurger.    The Kids Hot Dogs are very large, to large much for my 6 year old but just right for my 11 year.     Shakes are also very good and very thick."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised on how great the burgers and fries tasted, and the price was very reasonable! This is my new burger joint!"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from work; cheeseburger (with ketchup, mayo and lettuce), strawberry shake and fries. The shake = awesome. Definitely order the shakes.  The fries = they are handcut, not over seasoned, HUGE portion (the small order was served in a 16oz drink cup and overflowing with fries).  The burger = it was alright, a little salty (that says ALOT coming from me, I could drown in salt and be happy), and a bit difficult to eat because it kept sliding out of the bun.  Not the best burger in town or even downtown; but okay for delivery and definitely better than D-lux (I am picky about being able to TASTE that a burger patty was frozen, liiiiiiike D-Lux).  Sidenote: I don't know what all this talk about how \"small and flat\" the burgers were, mine was definitely pretty big.  All around, if you're looking for a burger joint, and five guys has the usual long line late at night, Mooyah will suffice.  Looking for a milkshake?  GO TO MOOYAH."}
{"text":"Went with zero expectations and got even less. I ordered the default number one on account that I wanted to get a taste of their original flavor , I also ordered a whole wheat bun which was way too sweet (with a cheeseburger i know, but still...), I also wish they would have told me that the onions were fried, and that it was a sandwich style pickle, all which accounted for a way too sweet burger, on top of that the spicy ranch dipping sauce was weird. I tasted the beef on its own and it had a good seasoning and flavor too bad they were trying too hard to f*** it up. The potatoes were good portions but the oil tasted rancid. If you're in the area and want to spend $10 on lunch head over to the flying hound Ale House."}
{"text":"Just finished dinner and the food was awesome...could've used more fried onion straws on my burger though, huge portion of fries. When I placed my order I went straight to the soda fountain to get my Diet Coke, it was out =( I informed one of the guys behind the counter who a couple minutes later notified another guy, then after I had decided to just get a Coke Zero I informed the gal delivering my food. It was only right before I was done eating that the soda was finally switched over, I got my correct soda to take home with me...would've appreciated it happening right away as I know it takes just a few seconds to switch it out =)"}
{"text":"Our first visit here tonight. Food was decent, price was a bit higher than expected at roughly $10 for a burger, fries and a drink but not terrible. They had a nice chalkboard for the kids to draw on while we waited for our food. Wait time was maybe 10 minutes and it was pretty busy there at that time so not bad."}
{"text":"Burger was really good but keeping the toothpick in to keep it al together is a must. I went there hungry and couldn't finish a medium fry (very salty) by myself. Customer service was phenomenal and all the employees were very friendly."}
{"text":"I placed an online order to go, but it didn't go too well.

First the bad...I ordered the New York Dog.  I received a dog that didn't seem to be grilled, only had a sparse amount of kraut, a bun torn in half and one pickle slice.  Missing the grilled onions, mustard, ketchup and the rest of the kraut, and pickles. (I asked the pickles and ketchup).  The buns was good and the dog was good, but all and all definitely a fail at over $4.  

The fries were pretty good.  Not the best, a bit over salted.  I ordered the medium figuring I could split them, but they were very skimpy.  I would have expected a bit more.

The brightest thing was the Mooyah cheese burger.  Again the ingredients were good.  Way too much mustard.  The bun was great.  The burger was great.  The other ingredients were pretty good.  

I'm sure they have better days, but I'd expect more consistency and accuracy."}
{"text":"I am already a big fan of the place after just one stop - It was fast, fun, tasty, and reasonably priced

We got two burgers and a \"Shareable\" size \"Half&half\" fries order. Burgers were both good - we were impressed with the quality of the ingredients, though I felt that mine was a bit smaller than the pictures on the menu seemed to suggest. The sweet potato fries were incredible. The regular french fries may not have een \"Mooyah-sweet-potato-fry-good\", but they were still pretty good too,."}
{"text":"Nice to have turkey and veggie burgers and lettuce wraps instead of buns for those of us who need something quick but are trying to eat healthy. Very delicious!

I have been there twice now and there are some of the nicest, most dedicated staff I've ever seen at a \"fast food\" restaurant. We were one of two groups at 8 pm and no employee was just sitting around or chatting. Everyone was cleaning or cooking and attentive to any need we had (more sauce, clearing out table). Very nice to see."}
{"text":"For being a burger joint this place honestly licks. It was a struggle to put down my burger because it tasted like salt and pepper. The only reason Mooyah receives 1 star was for the fries that were above average. Save yourself a meal and eat at Five Guys. Mooyah=bad"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch.  For 12 noon it was too empty.  It's a shame because lunch was good.  I guess no one knows about the place.  We just happened to notice the place while visiting another store."}
{"text":"Tried my first black bean veggie burger and it was very good. Definitely a repeat. Sweet potato fries today was a little over cooked. Had better ones before."}
{"text":"Once was enough for this Five Guys knockoff. The order was simple: burger and fries. The fries were ok, but not very hot. The burger was very over cooked, hard and dried out. When I complained to the manager she said, \"We cook them well done just like Five Guys.\"  She refused to cook a burger any less done than what I was served. I left after two bites and won't return."}
{"text":"We tried out Mooyah for dinner last Sunday night. You order your food at the counter and they bring it out to you. The cashier was incredibly friendly and helpful. There are a variety of burgers and a ton of toppings available. Some of the toppings are an upgrade but others like the sauteed mushrooms are included. I had a turkey burger and sweet potato fries. It was all very tasty and I have no complaints. This was a step above most fast-food."}
{"text":"Great burgers. If you have a bad burger here it's because if your own lack of imagination as you built it. Their orders of fries are huge just split em. And I'm sorry but their ice cream is just awful. It's really a poor showing in the dairy state."}
{"text":"Well, they have a few healthy options so that's nice. I got the turkey burger club. The bacon was way too crispy and there was too much seasoning on the patty but the rest of the sandwich was pretty tasty. My favorite part of going there was the fries, for sure. They're the perfect amount of crispy-ness.

Overall, I'll probably be going back but it's not a first-choice kind of place."}
{"text":"loved the fresh baked bun. I ordered their signature Mooyaah burger. The side of fries I replaced it with sweet potato fries with a little added cost. That was worth the switch. The sweet potato fries was crisp and well done. Shake was very thick and delicious. Have to forget about counting calories for sure. But it was worth it. Will surely be back."}
{"text":"As a new restaurant on State St that has a fun Wisconsin theme, I was excited to try out MOOYAH. 

I ordered the traditional MOOYAH burger on a white bun with American Cheese along with sweet potato fries on the side. This is a very basic route, as the menu permits a great deal of customization from lettuce wraps to turkey burgers-- though it comes at a slightly higher price depending on the number and type of additions. The set up is very similar to Five Guys, just with more options. 

In terms of the actual burger, I was extremely underwhelmed at MOOYAH. The meat was pressed so thin that I didn't really feel like I was biting into a juicy burger. It was over-seasoned beyond reason-- very salty. When licking my lips, I felt as if the grease that would spill over to the meeting of my lips was drying out my tongue. I wasn't left completely full after eating the burger. 

The sweet potato fries were pretty yummy-- very crisp and thinly cut. Almost had the quality of frites, which I did not mind. The \"one serving\" option of fries that I paid $2.99 for gives you plenty in terms of quantity; it covered nearly half of my metal tray. Luckily that was there to fill me up to make up for the burger that failed to do so. 

The service was great, overall. The staff announce your name and deliver your food over to you, and even take your tray away if they see it in passing. Great customer service and friendly attitude by the staff. 

The reason why I am giving MOOYAH 2 stars is highly influenced by their burger, which is their main item on the menu. It is overpriced for the product. I spent a total of about $10 for fries and a sup-par burger. I would go to Five Guys over MOOYAH any day."}
{"text":"As a loyal 5 Guys fan, I was honestly impressed!  The burger I had was fantastic, juicy and messy and the fries were great natural cut fries.   Mooyah is just still so similar to 5 Guys.  Mooyah really needs to embrace the Wisconsin culture even more!!!  I would love if this place would have local beers on tap and fried cheese curds.   Maybe even something like a patty melt!  

Great place, they just need to separate themselves from 5 Guys!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and amazing service!  They have a turkey burger and a whole grain bun as well for those looking for lighter options.  The sweet potato fries were stellar and a must try.  Our daughter ordered a shake and immediately declared it the best ever.  My husband ordered the double burger with blue cheese raved about the flavor as well as all the options available for toppings.  All in all a fabulous add to Sycamore Commons and we couldn't be more thrilled."}
{"text":"I went here on my hour lunch break for the first time ever (and I work at the Oldnavy right around the corner) I was prepared to pay about $12 for my meal because my coworkers informed me that MooYah is a bit pricey, but delicious quality food. By the time I was able to take my lunch break and walk over there I was starving. I walk in and the first thing I notice is the cleanliness of the restaurant. I walked up to the register explaining to the young woman it was my first time in here and I wasn't too sure about the ordering process. She was very kind and helped me create the burger I wanted with my meal. The wait time wasn't too bad. I expected it to be awhile because it was being prepared fresh and all. The moment my meal was ready I was shocked by the size of my burger. Okay. First off let me tell ya, I'm not a big burger fan to begin with so I wasn't expecting to LOVE the burger, but yes I loved that burger! It was by far one of the best burgers I've ever had! Fresh lettuce, American cheese with their MooYah sauce (thousand island dressing style sauce). I opted to get the regular fries and they were just as good. As I was eating I noticed a young family going up to the bell to ring it because they were satisfied with their meal and experience. As cheesy as it sounds I too rang that bell. I will be going back. I already downloaded the app for future orders and all. So I'm sure the employees at MooYah will recognize my face soon enough. So again thank you for the great quality food and wonderful customer service."}
{"text":"Bad service. I had a coupon but they have me odds and ends fries. The bun is cold was not toast or put on grill. Manager didn't not give us a new fries when we point on the piece of hair on the fires !!!! Will never go back! Negative 2 stars"}
{"text":"Great burger, got the wheat bun, the topping choices are great. Not too messy, given all of the condiments and toppings I chose. Cooked all the way through. The burgers are very wide, but terribly thick, so if you like a pink center, it may be a challenge. My new favorite burger place."}
{"text":"Great burgers!  Casual dining area and family friendly.  I will try the lettuce \"bun\" next time and MOOYAH sauce.  Will update my review at  a later date."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good plus it's not expensive if your on a budget. Only problem that happens all the time is bad customer service. Every time I eat there the same employee at the register seems to be so rude. Just watch out! Good grub, bad service.."}
{"text":"The service/people here are EXTREMELY nice, but the food is meh. Do not waste your money getting cheese because I had to search for the two crumbles of blue cheese on my burger. The sauces I requested were barely noticeable as well. The burger meat itself was tasteless. I was hoping for a go-to quick burger joint but the food just wasn't that good."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the generous black bean burger with all the toppings! Those alone make the price worth it. The shake honestly should be classified as a \"concrete mixer\" rather than a shake for expectation purposes."}
{"text":"Better than Five guys, not greasy.  Great seat on the burger, delicious homemade bun and crisp hand cut French fries.  Will definitely go back, especially on a Monday night where they offer a buy one get one deal after 5:00 pm."}
{"text":"Fries are good. Burgers very dry, no taste. Got the double burger with cheese and it just wasn't good at all. Having a stomach ache after eating it. Recommend Five Guys instead of Mooyah if you are looking to pay the same price for a better burger."}
{"text":"It's a simple concept, and good food!  I really enjoy their burger and fries - the shakes are great as well.  It's a great place to get a quicker meal and my disabled brother LOVES cows, like, LOVE LOVE LOVES them - so we really enjoyed bringing him here.  The decor is fun.  Honestly - I don't even know what else to say. :) It's pretty straight forward - a good burger and fries!"}
{"text":"Another one of my go to spots when I get lunch with co workers. Staff is always and friendly and the food never disappoints. If you are seeking a great new burger place then look no further. There are a variety of choices and something for everyone. I always get a cheddar burger with bacon and fries, I love that they have sweet potato fries. And I even splurge for a shake every now and then. This place never disappoints. Note there is WiFi and a gluten free menu."}
{"text":"Cheeseburgers are my weakness and Mooyah does them right! 
Fantastic burgers, you can actually taste the meat. I get mine wrapped in lettuce which is not only delicious,  but also makes me feel less guilty about devouring their awesome fries. Shakes are really good, super thick which leads me to tip #1 a small shake is plenty with a meal. 
Pro tip #2 is to sign up for their club (it's online somewhere) you'll get a free burger on sign up,  a free burger on your birthday,  and other cool stuff."}
{"text":"The good - Shakes here are better than anything at competitor burger joints. Better than anything Shake Shack has to offer. Fries are decent and they give a lot of them. The cashiers are also friendly and helpful.

The bad -  The Shakes are so good, but the sizes run rather small.

The ugly - Both times I've come here, the burger patties were super thin and drenched in grease. While the customization of toppings is great, the actual meat is the worst at this price point...significantly worse than Shake Shack, In n Out, Five Guys, Red Robin, etc. Heck, I'd rather have a Burger King patty.

Come to MOOYAH Shakes for their great shakes and maybe an order of fries. Skip the burger."}
{"text":"I want to like this place, but I can't. I've tried coming here 3 different times, and they were all the same. Somehow the order gets messed up in one way or another every time. This time, the one great thing about eating here, the sweet potato fries, were the most disappointing. Every fry I tried tasted burnt. I had to throw most of it away. The burger orders were missing toppings, and an extra patty was placed on the wrong burger. One of the burger's patty fell apart and was pretty dry. Thank god for the tomato that provided some kind of moisture to the burger patty pieces. 

They probably do make the burgers and the rest of the food okay for other people, which is why they have so many stars, but for me, it was too expensive for the quality of food given to me. I do understand that if they're busy, people tend to make mistakes but having mistakes all 3 visits is my limit."}
{"text":"Great place if you're trying to eat low carb. They have a lettuce wrap for the burger!  I had half regular fries and half sweet potato fries. I liked the sweet potato better. My burger was very good, the service was very good and I really like the rewards program. Try it. You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my burger there last week.  We were visiting from Kansas City.  You get to choose from 20 different things to put on your burger and you really only pay for bacon & cheese.

The burger meat is fresh, buns are cooked in shop and fries are great.  They slice them with the skin on and taste great.

I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Some good stuff on the menu, It is sort of confusing trying to understand the menu- I think if they clean up the menu it would make it much easier to eat here.  This was on whim- don't have any Mooyah burgers near my home. Way better than Five Guys and Culver's. I love fresh cut fries, I don't know why more restaurants don't do this - Im sure its cheaper than frozen junk... Any Hoot give it a try you wont be disappointed.. Bill was like 35 bucks for 3 custom ingredient double cheeseburgers, fries and shakes."}
{"text":"I came back to give Mooyah another chance, after a sub-par Five Guys experience and an email offer for free fries. The food was actually very good and the service exceeded my expectations. The food was brought out to my table and then the tray was taken away later on in the meal. 

The seasoning on the sweet fries was great, and the wheat bun was a nice option. Still not in love with the name... I hope the fact that business was very slow during peak lunch hours was just a fluke."}
{"text":"A good place for burgers and fries, never been to the restaurant but I can vouch for their delivery. A bit pricey and delivery is usually around 45 minutes if you are near Midvale but you are getting delivery of a fresh cooked burger so I think it is worthy it."}
{"text":"How do you put the right star amount on a mixed experience? We actually enjoyed the food. The burgers were tasty, and the fries were exceptional. My son also got a banana milkshake, that he enjoyed.

Unfortunately... he also came away with what we assume to be food poisoning. Stomach was upset almost immediately after eating, then spent the day in bed and in the bathroom.

I understand food prep is a tricky business, and there are going to be instances like this, even in the most sanitary conditions, but it certainly makes me wary of a second visit."}
{"text":"I have to give these guys just an eh.... It was not bad but it was nothing special  either. 

I came in at about 11:45 and just like everyone  has said it was empty. A couple of other guests came in while I ate but 3 tables  was the max number  of guests. 

I ordered the Mooyah  with cheese (and extra seasoning thanks to other reviews) with Cheddar , bacon, mushrooms , onions, and BBQ sauce. The bun is way too small for the burger. The toppings were kinda tossed under the patty, some here and some there. I actually  took it apart to spread the toppings out before I ate it. The flavor  was....well...BBQ sauce. The little drizzle  was the only flavor to the whole thing (even with \"extra seasoning\"). 

The fries were actually  really good . They are hand cut and made in-house . This is a huge pluse. They were seasoned well and we're not too limp or overly crisp.

I also order a strawberry  milkshake . I think  they forgot the milk  part. It is hand-spun  which is nice but without the milk I just got a cup of ice cream  with strawberry sauce .

Everyone  working seemed bored but I guess that is to be expected when you have almost no guests.

Overall not horrible but just a mid-range burger place. There are better  options for the prices."}
{"text":"We had three burgers, two were regular burgers with the basic toppings and cheese each wanted, one with the potato bun and one with the lettuce bun. Both of these burgers were tasty to be sure! The third burger is the famous fried onion topped burger which is actually the reason we came! My mom said the burger was good, but the pictures of the burger displayed everywhere at the restaurant display a burger topped high with friend onion straws which is not even close to what we received. There were maybe 4 little pieces and that was it. It was so disappointing because over and over my mom said \"that was the whole reason I got this burger and wanted to come here!\" The regular fans sweet potato fries were great and the servers were all super friendly!! Only complaint was the false advertising of what one of their best burgers actually was!"}
{"text":"Review is on quality of food and restaurant and -not- what my taste buds desire (practically 95% of Yelp reviews). 

I'll go ahead and say it because everyone else is afraid to. The fries are 100x better than Five Guys (unless you like soggy mounds of fries). They stay crispy and go perfect with the burgers.

The burgers have a different taste and this isn't a bad thing at all. It's primarily because of the buns they bake themselves as well as the seasoning they use on the meat. I really liked it, maybe you will too. Presentation is good, although I have found that the beef tends to 'slip' out as I bite into the burger. 

The service is great here. They will call your name to recognize you and then bring your food to the table. The manager/owner is also really nice guy that has talked to me a few times. Have never seen disgruntled employees and it always seems to be a good atmosphere."}
{"text":"We came across MooYah by accident. We were out shopping and we need to eat. I'm a fan of this place. I love the burgers. The staff is very friendly. It's in a nice shopping plaza. It's kindda like Five Guys but better. The actual burger tastes awesome. It reminds me a of burgers I had as kid. You should check this place out."}
{"text":"This place is awesome , I been there twice and I plane to go back . The service is friendly . The burgers are juicy there fries are nice and crispy ."}
{"text":"So many choices plus lettuce burger instead of bread if you want gluten free. Fast excellent staff! And the best of all it is clean! I will be going back many times!"}
{"text":"They messed up my burger order. I ordered a Mushroom Swiss burger with an extra patty (+1.50) when it came out I took a bite and realized there was only a single patty in my burger. I took the burger up to them and told them there was a mistake, they said sorry we'll make another one right away I tried to give it back to them but they said hold on to it. I went back to the table, and my wife had a few bites of the old burger. meanwhile the burger got cold, and the onion straws got mushy. It took a little while, but then they showed up with a paper basket with just a single beef patty and cheese on it, they dropped it on the table and walked away without saying anything. 

So instead of re-making the burger that they screwed up they just gave me a sizzling hot burger patty in a paper basket so I can re-assemble my half eaten burger myself barehanded. Poor poor service!

My wife's burger was OK, we got the chili cheese fries which were very seriously lacking Chili and Cheese. 

Poor service, poor food, next time we'll just go to Culver's."}
{"text":"Mooyah! So very close to booyah! I absolutely agree with the other reviewers in regards to the employees. Everyone working was smiling despite being quite busy. The gal working the register was very helpful and patient as I did my best to navigate the seemingly endless choices as quickly as possible. She even politely asked me if I was sure I wanted lettuce on my burger after quietly pointing out I had ordered the \"lettuce\" bun. Oops! Thanks for that. Clearly I don't go low carb often. Everything was incredibly fresh. Why the lack of five stars? Everything seemed a bit too salty. Hard to say if it was the burger patty itself or the onion straws. But the fries too seemed over salted. I don't think it was enough to keep me from coming back but it didn't give me that instant \"I CANNOT wait to eat this again\" feeling."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to grab a burger on state street. Excellent burgers, fries, and shakes. I always get my food quickly and the staff is helpful and friendly. The space is clean and the decor is super inviting. I love how they have the option to lettuce wrap the sandwiches."}
{"text":"While the food and service are all excellent, Mooyah doesn't really do or have anything that separates it from places like Five Guys. The menu options, the way the food is prepared, the prices...I really felt like I was in a Five Guys location when I was eating at Mooyah

Again, the food is great and I would certainly recommend Mooyah, but they really should do something to differentiate themselves. Maybe offer some unique burger toppings, unique sides, etc."}
{"text":"I have now found the ultimate burger of my life! MOOYAH has the best double cheese burger ever! My first time going to MOOYAH, I didn't really get anything. I shared a meal. This time around, I went there and was trying to order the Diablo burger but the guy who took my order got it wrong and got me a double cheese burger. Nonetheless, I didn't want to go back to the register and correct my order. I'm so grateful and happy that the guy got my order wrong. That first bite I took, changed my burger experience forever! Well... until I taste a burger that's better... if it actually exists. I loved it so much, I ate there 3 or 4 times within the week that I discovered the double cheese burger. Aside from the burger that I had, their fries are great too. They are hand cut and never really get too crispy but they are great fresh with the burgers! I also got a strawberry milkshake. I think the strawberry milkshake is delicious but too sweet for my taste. If I did get the milkshake again, I would get a small size to share with a friend (their small size milkshakes are pretty small... that's how sweet it is to me... and I'm a person that loves sweets)! I would highly recommend MOOYAH for the all time American burger experience!"}
{"text":"Likes: Food, facilities, service, and music not very loud.

Dislikes: Price, but come here with a coupon and you will really love it!

I went with my friend and $15 with the coupon is as great as a fancy restaurant burger's price and quality!"}
{"text":"Aways friendly  service.  One of the.best burgers in town. I highly recommend the lettuce wrap to replace the bun."}
{"text":"The walls in the bathrooms have toy robots and other childish moments. The restaurant itself is in a building too expensive any of us normal people could live in. Target market: expensive children.

The process of ordering at MOOYAH was really easy. The person at the register had a real opinion about food and was pleasant despite my normal all-too-inquisitive question process. The short menu has its highs, and the burger itself had just a few options. Cheese is listed twice because the clientele here is unlikely to realize that is a real option. Dummies are welcome here!

I may sound negative to you if you don't like the idea of being a child, but you're the one looking up a yelp review for a burger place that was built from a template. I can't say I'm any more mature than you.

If you've suffered through four paragraphs of this I suppose you are entitled to know how I felt about the burger. The patty is smashed, which is great. I think the plancha could have been a bit hotter for more sear - you are getting a well done burger anyways, so like, we might as well go full char. I think to double down on this well-done-anyways mentality I would be stoked to have a *smaller* patty and triple patty burger as the large option. I mean, to me the choice between single vs double is really \"sensible\" vs \"celebration of gluttony\". I would even take the same overall weight of burger if I could get more sear.

The burger options are absurdly long. This is where it reminds me of Five Guys.

The part where it reminded me of McDonalds was the secret sauce. And the corporateness of it all. The employees all seemed relatively happy, and the food was better than McD, so like, the only sad part here was my wallet.

I have devoted all the time that I wanted to on this review. I know it's not perfect, but hey, it's here and at least one of you dorks will message me about this so win win 

***They have malt vinegar and tiny totally out of place cups to let you put that malt vinegar in. I very much 100% respect this manuever by management. Aesthetics are cool, but hey, we need that malt vinegar even if you can't get the MOOYAH(tm) paper cup."}
{"text":"So in Madison for the day and got handed a flyer on the street for Mooyah Burgers 10th Anniversary!  Offered a free tshirt and a free cake pop with purchase of a shake.  Okay......I needed a burger and a shake.  I ordered the Double with lots of goodies included no Mooyah sauce.  Had it lettuce wrapped.....just cause.  Ordered fries and a shake as well.  

     Burger and fries came out nice and hot and made to my order specifications.  Shake hadn't arrived yet.  Burger was nice and juicy.  Now folks these are SMASH burgers so they will be thin.....but oh so delicious.  Fries were really good as well.  I asked for my malt and wound p waiting 10 minutes to get it....that's why 4 stars and not 5.  Not sure but it seems they have just one shake making thingie......not good when the place was packed.  When the shake arrived it was amazing and the added cake pop was a nice touch.  

       Yes I would come here again.  Yes I would try some differ not options on my burger. Yes I would get another shake....if it comes out quickly.  Long way for me to drive from San Diego though....but if you are in the area give em a shot."}
{"text":"Blown away by overall experience. Somewhat of a fast food atmosphere, but possibly the most delicious burger and fries I've ever had. Also very friendly staff at the State St location. My new favorite!"}
{"text":"First time here and it was so good I will be back for more. I'm from California so I'm use to In n Out and Culver's doesn't do it for me. So when my hubby told me to pick up lunch from here I was a bit sceptical on the taste. Photos don't do it justice. It was so juicy with so much flavor. I topped it off with 1/2 a mint chocolate shake and couldn't have anymore."}
{"text":"I am not sure what the hype about this place was. It seems to be on the same level as Five Guys. 

I had a burger, fries and shake. The burger was good. Great flavor, nice quality. The fries were completely lacking. Boring and nothing special. The shake on the other hand was SO think. It made a nice frosty/blizzard type of drink. However, a shake? Eh. Sometimes, you want a drinkable item.

I definitely plan to eat here again. It is a good quality burger but nothing outstanding. To put it in Yelp language, it is A-OK."}
{"text":"Visited twice and probably
Will not return. Unimpressive. We were 2 of 6 customers in the place and they still got our order wrong. Just basic burgers and fries for cheap."}
{"text":"These may be the BEST burgers and Chili cheese fries in town. I'd never heard of them before and you can bet I won't forget them any time soon. The burgers are savory and cooked to perfection and the buns and toppings are fresh and tasty. Better than smash burger and 5 guys any day. I feel lucky we have one so close by, this may be the only one in NC."}
{"text":"Very busy due to dinner rush.  Somewhat of a loud environment, we had to talk louder than usual at the cashier for them to hear our order.  Time from order to food on our table was relatively quick.  We got a burger (saut√©ed onions, fried onion strings, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles) and plain hot dog, both were amazing.  Fries are on point, fresh.  A bit pricy however it's worth it.  Food looked amazing and was delicious!"}
{"text":"Not sure how I've never heard of this place. But I'll definitely come back again. Made to order burgers than taste awesome and fresh. For 2 great burgers and fries for under $20 you can't go wrong! I got a turkey burger on a wheat bun with blue cheese, hot sauce and jalape√±os and my husband got a double burger on wheat bun with mooyah sauce, saut√©ed mushrooms, grilled onions, lettuce, tomato and cheddar cheese."}
{"text":"Good food, good service. Burgers are always done just right. Skip the shakes otherwise everything else is above par!"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place on my way to a movie. The burgers and shakes are really good with fresh cut fries. You can substitute sweet potato fries too. Fast service and VERY kid friendly without being annoying to a single person."}
{"text":"I'm updating this review nearly 8 months later - we have intermittently received coupons (through a mailer, in the Bucky Book, etc) that have made the prices easier to swallow. I increased a star because our son is now thoroughly a toddler, and it's hard to find places to eat out that work for all of us. We get our food fast, which is a must when you have a hangry little one. It isn't an incredibly loud place, but it's not particularly silent, either. If my son decides he wants to chatter at a louder volume, it just sort of blends in with the atmosphere. It's also usually filled with families (a more understanding crowd). 

Still not somewhere we go regularly, but it's on my list of quick, easy places to go when we decide to go out with our toddler."}
{"text":"Heart attack. Menu specializes in burgers, fries and shakes. Might want to check out Jourdanall cookhouse if you want something healthier. 

Vegetables were fresh and was a nice contrast to the greasy monstrosity that sat on my tray before me. Employees actively worked to make the floor and tables clean, which is nice because this is an open floor fast food joint.

Manager was super cool and personally thanked us for stopping in."}
{"text":"The absolute best fast food burgers there are. An incredible amount of options with fresh ingredients and juicy burgers make this my #1 spot around the country....but this location in Madison always has the best service. My go to is the MOOYAH burger with Bacon, Pepper Jack, Blue Cheese, Saut√©ed Onions, Saut√©ed Mushrooms, fried onion strings with spicy ranch sauce.......and their amazing French Fries!!"}
{"text":"Five Guys with a more inviting atmosphere and less greasy food.  That is the best way to describe this place.  You cannot walk in to Mooyah and say \"oh no, they are not almost identical.  Yes, they do have some healthier\"ish\" options and have sweet potato fries and salad, but really it is Five Guys repackaged.  Now with that said, I love Five Guys but I would rather go here for a burger and get it on a platter than stuffed in a greasy bag with tons of fries.  Five Guys fries does beat Mooyah in the awesome fries category.  The burgers are similar, though Mooyah was less greasy and a tad less flavorful.  The options are definitely geared toward the eclectic UW campus crowd and are certainly a pleasant alternative.  Price is similar, and really for the money, the options and relaxing (less yelling and loud music) atmosphere nudge this place ahead of the competition."}
{"text":"I said that I would re-review this place once they figured out the weird gristle problem, so here it goes.

Mooyah is part of the general trend towards higher-end fast dining experiences and \"luxury\" burgers on par with Five Guys, Shake Shack, In-n-Out, etc etc. And they do have all the trappings - lots of options for your burger, everything is freshly cooked, and prices are significantly higher than, say, Burger King. And while I appreciate the availability of options and the overall attempt at better quality, I don't quite think it's on par with other places, such as those I just named above. The meat isn't quite as fresh or as tender, the menu isn't quite as varied, and the prices aren't quite as competitive. I see that they're trying, but it's not clear to me how they're better than their competition. Right off the bat, I'd much rather just go to Culver's, who also has burgers that are fresher and more flavorful and more affordable, plus you can pick up some amazing ice cream as well. There's still a lot of room for improvement, and for the sake of their business I hope they're able to go through with some of them before they're swept out by the competition."}
{"text":"A Bucky Book coupon brought us here and I'm glad it did, we were impressed!

I long for more order at the counter type restaurants so it was a pleasure discovering Mooyah.  With three of us in our group, we were able to try a few things.  I had the bean burger substituting the ranch dressing that it came with for BBQ, another had a standard cheeseburger and the 3rd did a build your own with just bacon and BBQ sauce.  We added an order of medium fries was enough for the three of us.  As noted in a tip I left, in addition to the fountain soda selection, they also have sweet and unsweet tea which is welcome for those of us that don't drink soda.

All three sandwiches were delicious.  I was pleased that my bean burger didn't fall apart like most of them do.  It was also nice that they were able to handle the dressing substitution without any hassle and the guy taking our order was happy to accommodate. 

About the only negative I can think of is we were there on a cold and windy winter evening and the store front has a large glass exterior on the corner of the building so it was chilly inside, but if you're there in winter, hopefully you're wearing your winter coat anyway.

Mooyah, I hope you can make your way to the east side of Madison.  You would have regular customers in us!"}
{"text":"I love moo yah burgers! MOOYAH is a very casual dining area. They serve you on a stainless steel tray and give you great portion sizes. Their meat has a flavor that no one else can imitate. If you enjoy five guys, highway 55, or bad daddy's; I can assure that you'll love this place. Their \"MOOYAH sauce\" is different, but is an amazing condiment. If you're in the area it's definitely worth the visit.

Side note: The reason I can't give MOOYAH 5 stars is due to the young man behind the counter talking very loudly about death and hospice care to his fellow co-workers. This wasn't something my girlfriend and I wanted to hear about while eating and I'm sure the only other couple in there didn't want to hear about it either."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic!! Like chipotle but for burgers!! There were a lot of different options for how to make both burgers and fries, but my husband and I both got moo-yah style and it was amazing! The sweet potato fries are also great, especially with moo-yah sauce. Service was quick and very friendly and the cleanliness was awesome! Prices were also very reasonable. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food is good but it's the service I'm disappointed in. I was called to pick my food up from the counter. I sit down and within 60 seconds two employees bring out the food for one family and on single person seated. Why is it that I had to pick my food up but you had no problem serving a family and a single individual their meal. That was plain rude I'll stick with BT burger joint where the employees are super friendly and the food is just as great.
Make that three people."}
{"text":"I had a really good experience here.  I tried ordering online and picking up for carry out and it worked well.  The website is easy to use and worked well.  I went and skipped the line that ran half way around the store straight to the pick up.  They made the fries and shake fresh.  So from the point I walked in to when I walked out was about 5 minutes.

Food.  Really good.  For the sake of comparison, I'll use Culver's since I go there usually once a week.  The bun was great.  I got the multigrain and it was fresh and light.  I like Culver's butter toasted buns but the Mooyah ones were better.  I got the Mooyah Style.  The lettuce, pickles, onions, and tomatoes were top quality and tasty easily better that Culver's.  The burger patty was ok.  It was juicy and good quality meat.  But it did lack flavor.  In the midst of bun, veggies, and sauce got lost.  This is the place where I would say that Culver's has the better burger patty.  I got the sweet potato fries that were really good.  I would say that Culver's has sweet potato fries during the fall which I like better, but they are still really good.  i also had a shake and that was nice creamy and flavorful.  The straw was wide enough to use with a shake and not get clogged which was awesome.  Mooyah's shakes are exceptional while Culver's are above average.

Price.  When you compare it to places like Culver's it is more expensive.  But, when you realize that the employees are making a quality wage and the fact that they are using fresh quality ingredients you remember that you get what you pay for.  I enjoyed a quality meal served by a quality establishment.  I may not eat here once a week, but when I'm down near Fitchburg, I'm going to stop here and share my experience with those around me and tell them to try this place because it is exceptional in a area with some really good burgers."}
{"text":"Just tried mooyah today and love it! The menu is highly customizable and the restaurant has healthy options. I was apprehensive about getting the turkey ice burg burger, but it was surprisingly very rich and moist! You can choose your own toppings. There's a list of free toppings and premium toppings, which are no more than a dollar extra .

The sweet friends had such a wonderful warm aroma. Didn't feel greasy at all which is what I really like. And it also wasn't over salted , which is more of my own personal pet peeve."}
{"text":"The Madison area has a plethora of places where you can grab a great hamburger.  While I don't think it is on the same level of my faves (Tipsy, Alchemy), in a pinch, Mooyah delivers.  Ordering is pretty simple...pick your bun, toppings, and free condiments and away you go.  They advertise fresh baked buns (white or wheat).  While the white was a tad on the sweet side, the heftiness of the bun did a good job soaking up some of the toppings and grease from the burger.  
Would it be a destination restaurant?  Absolutely not.  But if I'm hungry and in the area, I wouldn't think twice about stopping in."}
{"text":"Eek is right! My burger was thin, falling apart, and dripping with grease. I couldn't eat it. Everyone's burger looked greasy and thin. I'm not sure what people's idea of a thick burger was but that was not good. I would not suggest it. NNNastay!! My bottom bun was saturated, completely sopping wet with grease. yuk!"}
{"text":"Juiciest burgers we've had in some time with plenty of fixings to top it off (turkey and veggie options too). The fries were fresh, crispy, and spicy. Could've had a salad, but burgers are king here! The kids had some thick shakes with their meals and gobbled up every bite. We'll stop again!"}
{"text":"Every time me and my family come here it's a great experience the food is really good quality the bread is homemade I always customize my burger the sweet potato fries are always fresh everything here is really really good"}
{"text":"Yeah, everything was awesome. Fries great, burger well seasoned, and the service was great. I went to Five Guys yesterday and it was horrible. This place was the opposite with juicy flavorful burgers and a dinning experience that was comfortable. Well done. BTW I had the exact same burger cheeseburger fried onions white bun as I did at the previous place for a pretty good comparison."}
{"text":"Yummy burgers, delicious grilled hotdog, and amazing sweet potato fries!! Love the atmosphere and options for burgers. The kids meal was an amazing deal as well! $4.99 for a regular entree, small side, and organic milk or other beverage. So glad we stumbled on this place!"}
{"text":"For a restaurant that opened today, one would expect for them to have a few glitches/mishaps on the orders. We ordered 8 different orders today for our office, everything came out perfect and made to order. The staff was friendly and processed everything efficiently. The owner was present and patient with staff members as, again this was their first day, they were still learning. The pricing was a bit high and no daily lunch specials were offered. 

Everyone agreed that the burgers were juicy, good quality, fresh, and very large. The French fries were cooked to order, seasoned perfectly.

Definitely will return, just not frequently due to pricing."}
{"text":"First of all I love burgers! My wife went with a friend yesterday and loved it so much she got me to come today! I loved it! The burgers are amazing, the sweet potato fries are delicious, and the Oreo shake is mind blowing... Lastly. The staff. Oh my gosh the staff! Warm, helpful, friendly, go the extra mile for you! The service is unbelievable! I look forward to my next visit:)"}
{"text":"Tried this place tonight and was nicely surprised. The burgers are really tasty with a nice burger to bun ratio and just the right quantity of toppings. Fries were hot and fresh and tasted hand cut. Standout chocolate shake, not to much chocolate and very smooth and creamy. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Pro Tip- You can order a mint oreo milkshake. It's not on the menu, but they have all the fixings to make one.

I love stopping at Mooyah after I've finished adulting (ie, groceries, bank, essentials for life, etc). It's a reward for being responsible and productive.

My favorite is the black bean veggie burger with added onion strings. Also, the $1 for the green chili cheese sauce is worth it. It goes well with fries (sweet and regular potato), burgers, and even while licking it off your face and fingers (I may be a really messy eater...).

Service is fast and they are patient with indecisive monsters like myself."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited here for the first time recently. We were looking for a place to grab a quick burger and shake. We had heard that the shakes here were pretty good. We were not disappointed. 

The overall feel reminds me a lot of a 5 Guys or even a Chipotle (even though the menus are completely different). We were greated with a big smile and friendly demeanor by the outgoing young lady at the register. We were able to order easily and each got a cheeseburger and shared a side of sweet potato fries and a Reese's shake. They also have veggie burgers and chicken sandwiches if beef hamburgers aren't your thing or you want to change it up a bit. 

The burger was very good. Not too greasy, not too messy.  The potato bread bun was a nice complement. The sweet potato fries were good as well. Not the best I've ever had but pretty darn good. What can I say about the shake? Man, it was thick and tasty. Took awhile before I was even able to drink it through the straw, that's how thick it was. Prices seemed to be good as well, maybe a little less than 5 Guys, a little more or the same as Culver's. 

The overall ambiance was ok. But, it's a \"fast food\" establishment so you aren't going to get too much. They do have an outside patio which is a nice bonus for when you want to be outside. Speaking of outside, the only negative from my visit was that the air conditioning was blowing so hard and so cold that we chose to eat outside because it was way too cold inside. They could stand to turn the A/C down a bit. 

I liked this place and will be back. Definitely eager to sample some other shake flavors and maybe a chicken sandwich too."}
{"text":"I love places that do a few things really well. If you want a quality burger, fries and a shake there are few places in Madison that do them as well. Service was also quick and friendly so you get good food fast with no hassle. Nice open seating area as well."}
{"text":"Loved the food here!! It is simple, trendy, and has amazing shakes. I couldn't have asked for a more perfect place for lunch. Employees are friendly and easy going."}
{"text":"My favorite Burger place, fresh ingredients and friendly staff a bit pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"I must say I had, excuse me, my family and I had the most wonderful experience a while ago. Not only do I love the food, but after a long day due to a family/close friend death and I can't begin to say thank you for how nice, caring, kinda employees there was working. Sadly I don't remember the lady who helped us name, but we must of walked with dreary looks after that long day looking for something quick and we were brought shakes and smiles with questions asking us if we were ok. So I am thankful to have somewhere to go even after a long day and be greeted with kindness."}
{"text":"Sometimes health is a priority, and other times you want french fries. 

When I find myself stuck in this catch-22, I go to MOOYAH Burgers, Fries & Shakes. 

That might seem a bit confusing, but seriously, you are provided with numerous options to make your burger stand on the healthier side of things and still walk away with some killer fries. Life is about balance, right? 

I always build my own burger using their iceberg lettuce as an option instead of a hamburger bun. Then, I load up on the veggies until I feel like my trainer would be proud and order a side of the best french fries on State Street. The vegetables are always nice and fresh; your burger is cooked on the spot, and the staff is always approachable. 

In regard to the \"fast\" part of fast food, I would say that MOOYAH is about as quick as a burger and fries would be at any semi-specialty burger place (think Five Guys). The one major advantage to this is that you will get to your destination on time and with food in your belly that won't leave you feeling oily and gross an hour later. 

If you are finding yourself already on State Street and on the hunt for a good burger in a sublime location (and newly with casual outdoor seating), look no further!"}
{"text":"Too pricey for what you get....I got the turkey burger moo yah style with fries....and I've had better. To put it simply, McDonald's tastes better."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with this place. I looked at a few reviews and they were all very good. 
So we stopped for something to eat. You order the burger and bun that you want, yes they have non-beef burgers and veg-burger. 
There house cut fries were Amazing. Cooked perfectly!!

I will return."}
{"text":"First time there & I had an Awesome turkey burger!! The fries with the mooyah sauce was delicious too!! Service was excellent, & the employees were patient & friendly with us, since we were newbies!!"}
{"text":"\"And NEVER order the Chili Cheese Fries:\" A Review of Mooyah 

This place has fine burgers and shakes. I've found over multiple visits in the few years since they've open that the fries are generally limp and soggy, which must be preferable to some. 

The fact that Mooyah is owned by Balmoral Funds LLC and Gala Capital Partners, equity firms famous for selling brands like Applebee's and Famous Dave's to specific regional markets, will not bother most burger eaters. But it's worth a mention to those who hope to support local businesses and real food from real people. 

The fact that Mooyah is not McDonald's, Wendy's, Burger King, Jack in the Box, Sonic, etc. may make you feel better spending your money there. In fact, it should be noted that Mooyah has pretty decent Morningstar-style burgers for vegetarians that taste fairly good, complete with avocado and other veggies that taste fresh. 

The only real reason I'm writing this review is because of the chili cheese fries I ordered yesterday. I write not to complain, but to simply warn other potential consumers. Admittedly, they were ordered for take away. I'm sure they would've looked different on a porcelain plate. But I do think the accompanying photograph will demonstrate how far afield these 'chili cheese fries' are from the actual thing. The thing you may have enjoyed at diners or greasy spoons growing up. Not that diner food is healthy or locally-sourced, but at least it was real.

The little plastic ramekins of queso and orange sauce with 0.2 oz of some beef product were really off-putting. I'm sure some customers complained at some of Mooyah's 100 restaurant units about chili cheese fries to go leaking onto their car's seats, and decided to implement the 'two ramekin' system. But that's not what chili cheese fries are supposed to be.

It's funny, because my partner and I ordered a large fries before I noticed the 'Chili Cheese Fries' option. I had to ask the register guy to delete that entry and adjust to one medium fry, one med chili cheese fry. I kind of wish I'd been warned that they are basically the same thing with an added two little plastic cups of nearly fake food product. No's ones fault. I'm just going to keep my lazy guilty pleasure chain burger joint a secret still, and probably skip it for a while. 

And NEVER order the Chili Cheese Fries."}
{"text":"This was a solid 3.5, but I'm in a good mood,, so 4 it is. 

The obvious comparison here is to Five Guys, and I think it matches or exceeds it in pretty much category:

+Nice space (extra points for 90s rock)

+ Friendly, helpful staff. Instead of doing strict counter service, they call your name, you raise your hand, and they bring it to you. It's a small touch, but a nice one. 

+ LOTS of options. They have four or five different cheeses, a few  roll options, and a long list of condiments. You can also order a turkey burger, which like. They definitely blow 5 Guys out of the water here. 

+ Good quality condiments. I had avocado, fried onion strings, and saut√©ed mushrooms. They were all fresh and tasty. The mushrooms seemed to actually be fresh, unlike 5 guys' canned BS. 

+ Food was attractively presented on a metal tray covered with a piece of brown paper and a toothpick in the bun. Definitely nicer than 5 guys' grease-spotted bag. 

+ Very nice bun. 

+ Solid fries. 

- The burger itself was really not that good. It was undersized, overcooked, overseasoned and dry. This is the downfall of places like this. If I'm going to indulge in a burger, I want it to be juicy and delicious. There's no such thing as a juicy well-done burger. You can make it greasy, like 5G does, but you can't make it juicy. You have a grill. Figure out how to cook a burger to order and slap a warning on the menu. 

- A little expensive. $10.50 for a burger with avocado and a small fries isn't terrible, but it's nothing to rave about. I can get a better burger cooked to order at Roast Public House for that. 

- No nutrition calculator. Am I really supposed to page through a Byzantine table to add up each ingredient? Make a damn calculator. 

-According to their website, a single burger is 5.3 ounces pre-cooked. A double burger is two 3.3 ounce patties. That's total horseshit. 

I'd definitely pick this place over Five Guys, but I don't see myself picking either one in the near future."}
{"text":"Just left Mooyah. I recommend the turkey burger lettuce wrap. It was one the BEST seasoned turkey burger I've had. Juicy!!!! Had I not made it back to my destination to sit & enjoy, I would have lost my burger out of the bag from to juices. Whew! Glad I got to enjoy it. It was very tasty & filing."}
{"text":"Finally gave them a shot. Some think it's pricey, but it's cheaper than 5 guys, less greasy, and cleaner. The concept is the same. Just tell them what all you want on the burger and bam. 
We really enoyed a burger better than fast food, but not super expensive. $5 gets you a good sized burger. We will be going back."}
{"text":"I did come back without a groupon. The place is growing on me. Love the sweet potato fries and burgers are good quality. Now I'm wondering why they have a TV that has only 1 channel. Was in there recently during an NFL playoff game and hey we're showing some obscure basketball game. I asked if someone had requested the game and if not could we switch it to the NFL. The server informed me that the TV never moved from that channel so either they have only 1 channel or the owner doesn't want to be bothered with switching back and forth."}
{"text":"Mediocre food that's way over-priced for what you get. Lots of topping choices, but one suspects that the customer is encouraged to select a lot of options in order to cover up for the lack of burger taste. Would not eat here again, because there are so many other places to get a better hamburger."}
{"text":"Mooyah more like moonah, I wasn't impressed at all very disappointed.  I got the Mooyah burger with cheese, lettuce, mayo and mushrooms for some reason my burger was sweet not sure why but it wasn't that good. The fries super limp greasy just yuck. The best thing was the sprite and the milk shake. Reminds me of 5 guys burgers. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Will up the review and stars when the sauerkraut rolls out to the place for the hotdogs."}
{"text":"What a cool concept for a burger joint. Mooyah is like Noodles and Comp and Which Wich for Burgers. Prices were very reasonable and portions were plentiful. What surprised me the most was the amount of topics you can add to your burger for NO ADDITIONAL COST! SAY WHAT?! Yes. I am sold! Their fries are handcut and homemade and the burgers are flat ( like Culvers) and flavorful. What was even more impressive was how fast the food was coming out.

 A knock I do have against Mooyah is if it is your first time dining at the joint, it is a bit confusing as to how to order. That being said, what seemed \"crazy\" to me was pretty organized for the workers. Good job."}
{"text":"Very good burgers homemade buns good fresh cut fries oldest son couldn't get enough of them hubby thought they had to much seasoning salt hubby loved his shake youngest loved his chicken tenders 2 adults 3 kids 42 bucks not much more then we would spend at Culver's much cheaper then five guys for about the same quality brothers three is still are favorite burgers but will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I simply love this place. My daughters and I went there after my youngest spotted it while shopping. Let me start with the meat... It's fresh ground beef and hand shaped on the grill. The quality is superb let's move on too the bread is freshly baked. I love the mooyah sauce and sweet potato fries were the best. I go there after time I want a great burger. Its better then bang bang...."}
{"text":"Good fast food. I would say the food has higher quality than other similar restaurants. The cheeseburger is, however, a bit greasy. The fried chicken sandwich is really good, especially the buffalo one. I highly recommend the chili cheese fries. The staff is also nice and willing to make your experience a great one."}
{"text":"I was visiting my sister in Charlotte and she wanted to try out MOOYAH. We walked in on a Wednesday around 4:30 and it was dead (we were the only ones there). The atmosphere is very casual, fun and eccentric, with vibrant colors and an area you can watch your food being cooked. I ordered a Morningstar black bean burger on iceberg lettuce (along with other toppings and condiments) and it was pretty big to me, I couldn't finish it. I appreciated that the burger was securely placed inside the lettuce and wasn't sliding everywhere or crumbling apart on my hands. The french fries were ok, lightly salted, no other seasonings on them - looks like some of them had grill marks on them, so not exactly sure how they are cooked. The prices are a little on the higher end (average burger price is greater than $6), but it may be due to the popular location. All in all, it was a good experience. 

Pictured also is a mushroom Swiss burger and chili-cheese hotdog."}
{"text":"What a surprise to fund this place in the middle of a completely yuppie uptown area. Wait..you aren't overcharging for burger and fries? Wait...you bring it to the table and are actually nice about it? OK, great!

These burgers were freshly ground perfectly cooked awesomeness. Juicy, stacked full of flavor and lots of options
 Their fresh fries were pretty rockin as well!!

If you like good burgers and at a reasonable price...PLEASE find this place! You will NOT regret it!!"}
{"text":"The idea of Mooyah is not much different from a Five Guys or a Smashburger, though the execution is way off base, as evidenced by a nearly empty dining room despite being there during lunch hours (late lunch, but still lunch - other nearby eatieries were packed).

Approaching the register, you order your protein: Mooyah burger, which can be doubled, turkey (which is ground, but not everyone seems to know if it's ground, cutlet or fried) or black bean. Go with the black bean - the others aren't worth it, especially the namesake Mooyah.

After that, you choose your cheese, if you want it, for an extra charge. If you want avocado or bacon, you add that, for an extra charge. Then you add any of a bunch of extra toppings, for no extra charge. This is nice, but it gets into that realm where you can really screw up the taste if you aren't careful - having some pre-made choices would be a good idea (think of the Smashburger menu for some examples).

The good news is that you aren't likely to mess up that bad, because nothing really has much flavor, including the Mooyah burger. Maybe this is the way they make it, but it's not good. Adding a condiment like Cholula (nice to see, but not nice to need it) can help.

Even toppings, such as lettuce, tomato and onion strings don't have a lot of flavor. Don't like bleu cheese? Don't worry, because it's bland. About the only thing that did have a taste were the black bean burger and the nicely crisped bacon, so those might be good choices if you're after something with taste. The fries, supposedly that take \"24 hours to make in a six-step process\"? Also not worth it, so skip 'em."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!! Between 2 people our meal was about the same price as 2 meals at Culver's , but the food is waaayyy better!!! Much better then 5 guys as well!! The meat is seasoned very well and the fries made to order stay crispy for a long time! This will be our go - to burger place for now on! But, If the prices were any higher we would just go to Blue Moon Bar."}
{"text":"We decided to try Mooyah for lunch and couldn't have been happier! I tried the veggie burger on lettuce with onion straws & cheddar cheese (very basic), and sweet potato fries. It was delicious! The lettuce held up well to the burger and everything was cooked perfectly. I loved the crisp, fresh lettuce! Such a refreshing, tasty alternative to a bun. The fries were crispy with a little spice - maybe the best sweet potato fries I've ever had. Also, the onion straws were so good I had to wonder why they weren't a side. They added the perfect crunch to my burger and had such great flavor. 

My husband tried a beef burger & admitted he preferred it to 5 Guys. 

The staff was very nice and accommodating. I left my purse on my chair as we left and we went back to get it...as soon as I walked in, I was handed my purse as if they were waiting for me, and they were busy! They were so sweet & helpful. Overall - between the food & service, I'll be back for sure!

Cons (just to be honest): Avoid the chicken, stick with veggie burger, red meat or turkey burger.  The chicken texture & way it's fried isn't as appealing as other options."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my milkshake and my fries very much, but my burger was screwed up (got onions and spicy sauce). I would have had it redone but I was short on time."}
{"text":"The burgers are meh. Not better than five guys. Not better than Culver's which is a real shame. The meat is always promoted as fresh but all the times I've gone the meat has been very stale and underwhelming.

The fries are also okay. Better than five guys but I really dislike the peanut oil FG's uses.

The milkshakes are terrible. Probably the worst shakes in the city. Definitely the worst milk shakes I've ever had from a place that should have at least DECENT shakes. 

They, the shakes, never have any flavor and the people working tell you to add more flavoring but for more money!!! No thanks! You can also tell they never properly mix them...even when it's dead slow and your the only customer...

I know it's a 'new' place (open now for 1-2 years) but the workers are all miserable and nobody ever seems to want to be there.

The app is okay but needs a revamp when it comes to coupon and other promotions.


I won't be back again. For 10-13 dollars I can get a really good burger or shake or whatever just up the street. 

Clearly mooyah is not interested in changing they're flavor palette, I believe they missed the mark on many levels"}
{"text":"If you value a great burger, DO NOT EAT HERE. The burgers are slightly off, the customer service was terrible for the value of the food. If I wanted crappy service and sub par burgers I would have went to McDonald's. It's not rocket science, either you greatly improve your customer service or the food. All in all not a very good experience!!!"}
{"text":"Decent burger but the cost for a single patty burger+small fries+medium drink was way too much.  $10.25 for this type of restaurant is a rip off.  They are missing the mark and maybe that's why it wasn't busy at peek time for lunch.  Won't be going back."}
{"text":"I've been to this Mooyah a couple of times. The first time I was in, I had a cheeseburger with lots of veggies and ketchup. The seasoning on the burger was pretty darn tasty. The burger was done to perfection and was juicy. The fries were a bit over salted though. Otherwise, a very good meal. I went a second time to try a bunless burger. It seemed a little greasy to me. It may need a bun to help soak up some of the grease and juice from the burger. I had juice running out of the lettuce wrap (and paper wrapping) and all over my fries. No! No soggy fries! The bunless sandwich was very messy compared to the burger in a bun. Fries the second time were seasoned nicely. Overall, a nice addition to Fitchburg!"}
{"text":"Place just keeps getting better. Burgers are always good. Fries are getting fresher. Shakes are always good."}
{"text":"The burger was pretty delicious, but the prices are on the expensive side. The service was great!"}
{"text":"The free add-ons sounded appealing and included items like fried onion rings, saut√©ed mushrooms, etc and then there's the option to add applewood bacon, avocado and cheese for an extra $.99. And interesting sauces like spicy ranch, Cholula and mooyah sauce. 

I totally loaded up with practically all the options available just to be served a flat burger. What?! Instantly, I was disappointed and thought how Five Guys would serve up a burger were I can barely open my big enough to take a bite. I opened the burger to make sure all the ingredients were there. Unfortunately, they were. 

The worse part was the flavor. Must be because I went right at 9:30 (they close at 10). But my entire burger tasted like oil. Couldn't taste the spicy ranch, couldn't taste the fried onion (but it did give texture) and I couldn't taste the patty.

I gave it a try, but will probably won't be returning."}
{"text":"Burgers were great on our visit as were the fries; it was very loud in the dining area. You have people yelling from the cash registers (what is the point when it's so busy?!) I think there was overhead music, and then add some kids and you will not be able to carry on any conversation. We'll probably grab something to go next time, but when you live on the east side, it's not likely it will taste as good when you get home."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place. It's close by & I can get a veggie burger quickly. The staff is nice. However, they've never once gotten our order right & we've probably gone there 4x or so within a span of 1-2 years. We went there again today to give it another shot, but nope, they screwed up both mine & my bf's order. The burgers we ordered literally had avocado in the name but neither of our burgers came with avocados on them. They still tasted fine but I specifically got that burger for the avocados. Maybe someday they'll get it right, but I doubt we'll ever go back again. The sweet potato fries were okay, kinda soggy though. My bf liked his chili cheese fries."}
{"text":"GREAT burgers. The place was clean but a bit hectic. However, one of the best burgers I've had in a while! The only other thing I'd say is that it might be a tad over priced."}
{"text":"If you need a good burger you can get one here. It is definitely more pricey than traditional options, however, the standards and customizable choices are plentiful. I definitely appreciate the variety of toppings and the staff did a great job of making sure they were present without being overly so. They also offer a \"lettuce wrapped\" burger - awesome that you can avoid the bun without feeling like a jerk for asking! 

This spot was super-packed when we arrived (no seating available) yet the line moved very quickly. We opted to sit outside due to the noise inside and this proved awkward as well since you are in a high-traffic area...this is more of a \"me\" issue though as this place is super kid friendly - where I am not always...

Apparently the milkshakes are awesome here and completely worth it. I would like to go back, order to-go, and enjoy the meal in a local park - the ambience is a little lacking when it is crazy busy. The little extra for better ingredients, people, etc. made the experience worth it."}
{"text":"Big tasty burgers with fresh toppings on high quality buns, fresh cut fries, and tasty shakes...what more could you ask for?! What sets Mooyah apart from the other artisinal burger joints is an absolutely delicious seasoning mixed into the burger meat - the burgers themselves are really, really good. So, I've you've got a discerning palate you'll probably like Mooyah more than the competition. Waitstaff are friendly and attentive, prices are very reasonable, and the atmosphere is comfortable and clean with a chalkboard wall and chalk for the kiddos. Keep up the good work Mooyah!!"}
{"text":"The place is really good especially with the seemingly infinite number of possibilities and combinations. The thing that got me hooked was their amazing staff who took out the time to actually talk to you."}
{"text":"This is my favorite burger joint in town. I moved here almost a year ago now and I am in love with the burgers, and the restaurant service/ staff in general. They've never messed up my order, are always happy to accommodate my special requests and they are super friendly. The restaurant is always spotless as well. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"So many options to appease even the pickiest eater, that would be me :)

GLUTEN FREE, no problem, there is a well built lettuce bun for any burger item , or gluten free buns! Do you realize how happy this made me feel , it is so hard to find burger spots that offer gluten free buns. 

What we ordered:

-Farmers burger: Vegan, black bean burger on a lettuce wrap with a side of sweet potato fries
-A1 Burger- name speaks for itself
-Kids Grilled cheese with apple sauce ( my 2year old killed this)

What we liked: EVERYTHING, from the fast and friendly service, the size of each burger and side, the taste, and the prices. This is my new favorite spot for burgers , non-gmo potato buns for each burger or you can also do wheat ... like I said plenty of options.  I wasn't able to try any of the other menu items but I did see chili chees fries, and milk shakes. 

Mooyah definitely exceeded my expectations , so long five guys... and don't forget to ring the bell before you leave If you received good service, we sure did ."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch this evening and was highly underwhelmed. A dad with 2 children was waiting off to the side while 3 employees were consulting a wall chart. Things didn't seem to be going well for them, as no one acknowledged them whatsoever while I stood there. I went to the restroom, and when I returned, they were still standing there and decided to leave.  I was then greater by a man and pointed towards the family now leaving. Another staff member chased them down. I ordered a burger with a few toppings, and an order of sweet potato fries. The bun to burger ration was terrible, and the bun was so greasy that I was unable to finish my burger. The toppings had been stuffed on the underside of the burger, and we're pretty meager....3 pickle ends, half a strip of bacon, and the blue cheese was barely heated. The sweet potatoes fries were redeeming until the 3 men working began to order the lone female worker around much like Cinderella while they all dissapeared"}
{"text":"Like the healthy options. Food tasted good but burger patties are small. I had an iced double turkey burger and was still hungry afterwards. The service and the staff was excellent and was all the worth going back."}
{"text":"I've been a \"Five Guys\" fan forever but this place blows it out of the water. The burgers are juicier, the fries are amazing (especially the sweet potato fries) and the shakes are delicious. There are so many more options than you can find at Five Guys as well. Our first visit, I had the \"Crandidate\" (a Turkey burger especially for this election year) and was very pleasantly surprised at how tasty it was. My son got a hot dog and, not only is the dog itself yummy, the bun is fresh and delicious. On our next visit I got a burger (the Well D'Onion to be exact) and was absolutely blown away. Seriously, if you live close enough to have the decision in where you go for your burgers out, check out Mooyah. I'm hooked!"}
{"text":"I ordered this in September of 2017 and the fact I can remember everything about it, says a lot. Now I had heard things about Mooyah but I didn't know who they were or what they did. All I knew was that I was hungry and had just moved into Madison. 
    My first thought as I looked at my turkey sandwich, the little moo shake and the fries (a size, I will never admit to). I customized the turkey sandwich on a potato bun with sliced avocado, lettuce, pickles, tomatoes, fried onion strings, Grilled onions, Mooyah sauce and Frank's Hot Sauce. I remember the first bite and I felt my soul leave my body. I inhaled so much. . . in so little time.  I know my coworkers looked at me in shock but dude, it was good."}
{"text":"I had heard from some folks that I golf with that the restaurant was ok,but the reviews gave me a lot of hope that this might be as good as Five Guys, which is the standard for me for chain burgers.

The place was packed, but the line seemed to move pretty well.  I liked that their menu was structured a lot like Five Guys', so it gave me a basis of comparison.  

Simply put, there was no part of the meal that was outstanding, and a lot of it was disappointing.  The burger itself was too salty and the taste was ooff.  My wife did not finish her burger because of the salt and dryness of the patty.  We also ordered the fries, which were dry as well.  We tried two dipping sauces: spicy ranch and the Mooyah sauce.  The former was good, but again a little salty.  I thought the Mooyah sauce was inedible, cloying in both sweet and salt.

Certainly for the price (over 6$ for the burger) it was a bad value.  I much prefer going down the street to Mr. Brews."}
{"text":"Been holding off on reviewing, but I will now. I've tried to like this place because it is conveniently located, but I'm incredibly disappointed.

First, let's talk cost. 2 burgers and a hot dog with 3 drinks and a thing of fries is $30. If I'm going to spend that kind of money on fast food, it better be worth it...and it is definitely not worth it.

The food is way over salted. The 4 times I've tried to eat a burger here all I could taste was the salt on the meat. The last time I ate in the restaurant here, my burger was pink in the middle still and was really spongey. Not good.

Final straw was when I was waiting on a to-go order and one of the staff members was trying to add sweet tea to the canister. The two guys standing behind the counter watched as this poor girl
struggled with the container behind me. I didn't see how she lost her grip on it, but she managed to dump the whole thing of sweet tea down the entire back of me and all over my purse and shoes - and I was in work clothes. The two guys behind the counter never bothered to help this girl clean up, instead they laughed and tried to look disinterested. She apologized, but it wasn't her fault - no one bothered to help their fellow coworker and they left her to clean up the mess. One of the guys dipped into the back, and I'm assuming the guy who came to speak to me was a manager, but he never apologized and handed me a wad of napkins to clean myself off with and vanished again. Really? Your store managed to ruin a jacket and my work clothes and you don't even utter an apology? I've told my coworkers and friends to not even bother - just go up the road and get a great burger from Shomar's instead."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food. It's very much like Five Guys (which is a good thing). The burgers were very juicy and fresh, the buns were great, tons of good toppings to choose from, and the fries were exactly how i like them (fresh cut with skins on). I'm also so pleased to have a decent quick burger joint on the west side. Will return again. 

The ambiance was a little crazy, but they had just opened so I expected that. Music was really loud, dining area was crowded, and the track lights were blindingly bright. Next time I'll get it to go or eat outside, but I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food here isn't bad it's the customer service. As someone in the food industry this place can't handle pressure when they get in the weeds. I was put on hold for 20 minutes and when I finally arrived they picked up and hung up on me. That's when I asked about the hold up and the manager just snapped saying there was a line. When I arrived there was no line. Plus that's not the right way to answer my reasonable question. To me customer service is everything and if they can't handle the heat get out of the kitchen!!! 

The food wasn't for me thank god because I probably wouldn't trust it after the way they got so defensive. 

When I finally got the food the lady was nice yet no respect from the manager."}
{"text":"Don't plan on leaving hungry. Great handmade patties and the toppings are very fresh and plentiful. $.50 for a slice of American cheese seems a bit pricey when you are paying $6 a burger. Nonetheless the quality of food is above the norm for burger joints. 
     The real potatoe fries with skins on them are a good addition. Very generous potions (a medium was more than my daughter and I could handle). And they were not too crispy yet not too soggy either.
     The staff is both helpful and entertaining. Look for the serving assistants to have fun announcing the names and orders in the microphone, and the staff is ready to accommodate any requests for extras, as well as carry your meal to the table for you. 
     All in all the food was tasty, cooked the way I expected, and left me satisfied to say that I would be back for another go. Don't take younger kids because it is very pricey and they do not offer smaller portions or a kids menu. Perfect date spot for Foodies!"}
{"text":"Quick and so good. I had to get a quick lunch since I was super short on time. I had tried mooyah my freshman yr of college and did not like it, but I decided to give them another shot. Idk if they've changed or my taste buds have, but the sweet potato fries were amazing. That's all I had since it was just a small lunch, but they definitely convinced me to come back and try the burgers too. This review is basely solely on the fries nonetheless and I'd like to say, I'd vouch for them any day of the week. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Decent burgers and fries.  Thumbs up for all things being fresh.  Shakes are mediocre.  Can't say I will be yearning to visit again."}
{"text":"I wanted to go ahead and give this place a run, as it is close to my house. The service and atmosphere was good, but I was really intrigued to try the burgers. I went with the Sloppy Whoa and it was decent but Perhaps I should have ordered something else as I was left wanting. I did like the boardwalk style fries and appreciated the vinegar on the side. I may come back to try a different burger."}
{"text":"Owner has a bad attitude .. He is a very rude person ,, Never supporting his business again !! And I think he under pays his employees!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"good cheeseburger ! Amazing ! Surprised! And cheap! Go twice with friends. Nearby my home, nearby target, there are a lot of shops and amc!

Try beef , I like it."}
{"text":"My craving for burgers & fries was fulfilled at Mooyah! Juicy burgers, crispy fries that were not greasy. Kind, cheery, & helpful team. I will be back to try the shakes next time."}
{"text":"I got the mooyah burger as a lettuce wrap. Burger was well seasoned and cooked perfectly. Did not miss the extra bread. Fries taste fresh and have a good texture although they were a tad salty for my taste."}
{"text":"Crazy as it may seem, but I may have to go out on a limb and say they have the best burgers in town.   It's just as quick as its good.  Little much on the high side (price), but you get it how you want.  Great pleasant staff also."}
{"text":"I'd been once before and because they could NOT cook my burger 'to order' got my $ back. BUT, my son and I were truly hungry for home-cooked burgers and were in the area so we tried a #2 time. I MUST admit my well done burger was still EXCELLENT in taste and IF I had known it would be THAT AWESOME I'd have waited on the fries! I'm a gastric bypass survivor, so burgers are 'one of those foods' I must eat very slowly...and in 2-3 meals. For me, once a burger is refrigerated it loses something, but I ended up giving my fries to my son, who got a double burger meal, and kept that burger close by and unrefrigerated, and nibbled on it over 5hrs til it was GONE! These guys know how to grill a cheeseurger! At roughly $10. for the meal it was worth it, our total bill= $25 for 2 meals...they're cheesburgers, people!! Still, I'd probably go back for a good burger when I have that hankering for an AWESOME cheeseburger.
The wheat bun, very good! Fries were only warm, and we were the only ones IN the restaurant, but I was tired and let them slide over the burger being my main focus and knowing my son will eat anything.  The restaurant is spic-n-span clean! The employees very personable; all of them, and talked to us; didn't just answer questions. Next time, because of my gastric surgery, I'll be getting a kids meal, but these burgers are EXCELLENT tasting and I bet we will become frequent flyers here. Note: It IS expensive...not a one $ buger....NOT a fast food restaurant. I was SO burger focused I did not even see what elsewas on the menu...OOPS!"}
{"text":"Their fries are heaven... While it to s always crowded the people are always friendly. Burgers are juicy and tasty.. I think one of the best burger places around"}
{"text":"We tried this place for the first time today and was pleasantly surprised. The burgers were really tasty and the bread (we got the artisan white) was AMAZING! I like the concept of building your own burger so this was perfect for me.  The service was good and the hand cut fries were cooked just right. I would definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"I try to eat healthfully, so when my husband wanted to go here, I was reluctant.  I was completely wrong, though.  They have lettuce wraps, whole wheat buns, or white buns to choose from.  They have the most delicious veggie burger.  They have all sorts of wonderful toppings.  You can be healthy and come here, no problem.  I'm so happy about this place.  If you come, be sure to get the sweet potato fries.  The servings of fries are big, so probably a small is big enough to share.  My only complaint is that the shakes are hard to sip through the straws, because they are so thick, but I don't really mind since I rarely get the shake.  We have been back MANY times.  Lovely restaurant, fast service, and yummy food!"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE that they offer a lettuce wrapped option instead of the bun! Finally a burger place that doesn't look at me like I have two heads when I don't want a bun, lol. I am on a low carb diet and this fits in so perfectly. Got a super loaded burger in lettuce, DELICIOUS. Really appreciated that they gave me a knife and fork too without asking! Will be back tons and tons!"}
{"text":"This place is clean and open. Food was very good the burger patty was on small size, but the meat was very tasty. Fries portions are huge."}
{"text":"I love Mooyah! You get to choose your burger and whatever toppings you like, which allows you to create your perfect burger. Not to mention you have a choice of white, wheat, or lettuce (for my low-carb boyfriend, ha) for your bun choice. The sweet potato fries are to die for, there's so much flavor and cooked with the perfect crisp!! I could eat them daily :)
The price is a little high, but it's worth it! ( and frankly, it keeps me from going there ALL the time. ) I would choose Mooyah's over \"five guys\" any day."}
{"text":"The food is good, you know burgers and fries. The service is not great. The staff is not rude, more like disinterested. This is my third time here and the second time my order has been wrong. When I tell them what is wrong they stare at like I just handed  them the world's most complex math equation. Perhaps more training...."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers with all the toppings you want (included in one price)!  The sweet potato fries are good and I love the option for the lettuce cap \"bun.\"  It's a little expensive for a burger and fries (and especially if you add a shake), but once you start eating, you forgot that you just paid $10 for a burger and fries.  The beef is juicy and delicious.  My fav is a burger with saut√©ed onions, saut√©ed mushrooms, and tomato with a lettuce bun.  My kids like the chicken fingers, grilled cheese, and the kid's burger."}
{"text":"Service was friendly, BUT I classify this as a modified fast food restaurant it should not have taken 20 minutes for a burger, fries and drink.  Then lets talk about the salt burger.  I ordered the Mooyah burger done the Mooyah way which means sauce, tomato, lettuce, pickle, grilled onion and American cheese on a whole wheat bun.  My first bite was with everything and it seemed salty so I scrapped off the extras and took off the bread and just tried the burger, turns out it was the burger itself that was overly salty, in fact so salty there was no other taste coming through.  Definitely NOT going back."}
{"text":"The best hamburgers ever and the buns were excellent. I had the sweet potato fries and my husband had the regular fries. Both were were so good but my husband ate some of my fries and I have never seen him eat sweet potatoes. The shakes were awesome . I also liked the fact that my food was served on a tray, not in a bag. Mooyah is now my favorite place to get really good, really fresh food, prepared just the way I like it."}
{"text":"This is my personal favorite burger place in Madison. I love their multigrain buns and the fried onion strings you can put on the burger. We've been here many times and my burger has always been juicy (yes greasy, but good) and delicious. Fries are best eaten right away or they tend to get soggy as they sit, but they usually dump a bunch of fries on top of your order in the to-go bag. Sometime you have to wait a couple minutes even when ordering ahead of time but I think it's because they make the fries fresh with every order. Easy to order online through their app and you earn rewards on future orders. We have always had good experiences with the friendly staff. Order the green chile queso dip to go along with your fries!"}
{"text":"The food was good & the place was clean.  The manager was sweeping up & keeping the tables clean.  All the employees were very polite."}
{"text":"Mooyah is trying to be Five Guys, but fails miserably.  It's not even Hardee's, at best.

I ordered the same type of burger I normally get at Five Guys, and then I sat down to wait. And wait. And wait. The place was crowded, but it still took them a good ten minutes and change to get me a burger and fries.

The burger-to-bun ratio was weak.  The meat was gray and lifeless, tasteless.  The condiments were skimpy.  A single leaf of lettuce, a few pieces of thinly shaved onion, a rice-paper thin slice of cheese.  It did not a burger make.

The fries were even worse.  They were crusty and hard.  They tasted okay, but they were clearly overcooked and then left under a warmer far too long.

For the $10 and change the meal cost me, I expected a helluva lot more.  Culver's, Hardee's, Five Guys, and a dozen other places all do a better burger.

How this place opened two locations is beyond me."}
{"text":"Normally I like the food and it's usually a lot. When you get a burger they warn you the large fries are a lot. And when you eat in it is, a little too much for 1 person. So I thought I would get a family size fry to go. When I got home it wasn't any bigger than a large it seemed. Very disappointed. I seriously could NOT feed a family on this. It was a waste of money. Like most places near State Street never order anything extra you don't ever seem to get it."}
{"text":"This place was awkward, awful and slooooow. I contacted management via the info on my receipt and never head back. Well guess what, I'm not going back!"}
{"text":"Great addition to Fitchburg!

You order at the counter. You have your choice of burger, double burger, turkey burger, veggie burger. You pick a wheat bun, white bun, or lettuce. Then pick your toppings. 

The burger was juicy and delicious! Our burger patties were kind of falling apart, but the bun held up well.  I love that you can customize your burger and get exactly what you want. The burgers were tasty and very well seasoned (though the seasoning is very high in salt if you look at the nutrition facts online http://mooyah.com/menu_nutrition/NUTRITIONAL_INFO_April_2015).

I was pleasantly surprised that they call your name and bring your food to your table instead of having to go up to the counter. The guy who brought our food was the most happy pleasant food service employee I've ever seen."}
{"text":"Really like this place. It is near where we live and we had heard good things. I am not a fan of most of the eateries in our area, so we were excited to hear of a solid place near us. The burgers are great! They offer wheat buns, white buns or lettuce wraps for low carb fans. The burgers are really well seasoned, and cooked to be crispy on the edges. Lots of different toppings and sauces to build your own, and several cheeses to choose from. There are also salads, a turkey burger and black bean burger options. Several flavors of shakes to choose from, we did not try one, but saw others with them and they looked delicious. 

Now to the fries. Unfortunately, McDonalds remain my favorite fries. Mooya's are the skin on type. They are cooked well and you get a lot, I just am not a fan of this type of fry. They also have sweet potato fries which we did not try.

Our meal of a single Mooya cheesebuger with fries and soda and a double chheseburger, fries and a soda was $23+ change. Not cheap - but at least it is good, tasty food. Next time we will share fries since it is a big order.

The staff is courteous and efficient. The manager is there and circulating with the customers. It was busy the entire time we were there. If they keep it up they will do well! Finally a solid place to eat near us!!"}
{"text":"Like the concept... however, when I visited... I was the only one in the restaurant.  Could have been a fluke, but there were more employees than customers.

Was greeted very nicely upon entering and I wasn't familiar with the way things worked here but the nice young lady that was cleaning off tables walked me through the menu and took my order up at the counter.

1:  Pick your meat 2:  Pick  your bread 3: Add your toppings  4:  Choose any sides.  Simple enough.  I tried a turkey burger on a wheat bun with fries.  They cooked it fresh and it was brought out to me... probably if the place were busier, I would have had to retrieve the burger from the pass, but the manager brought it to me.  I think what was comical was when I put my order in, there were about four employees watching the one employee make my burger on the flattop.

The dining room, while empty, was casual and relaxed... clean tables with some modern metal cow-themed decorations on the wall.  Looks like this is a national franchise and this is the first location (maybe trying to test out the NC market).

I'd say this place is trying to be a Five Guys with a bit of Shake Shack, but hopefully their business picks up, otherwise, I don't see them lasting very long."}
{"text":"I just ate the best burger I've had in recent memory.

The husband got a 'MOOYAH' style burger and I got a cheeseburger.  My plate was clean within 5 minutes and I wasn't even that hungry... It was THAT good.  Hubby said his burger reminded him of a gourmet In and Out burger... He lived in CA for several years and tells me that's a very big compliment.

We will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"I was excited about this place and heard great things but my burger was way too salty. 

Okay I gave this place another try and didn't get the mooyah sauce ...not sure if that's what made it salty but my burger was very good and not salty"}
