{"text":"Love this place! Great addition to Aurora! Love the Salmon and Veggie pizza!  We sat outside last weekend - great atmosphere. Everyone in my family of 5 enjoyed their meal!"}
{"text":"Not as great as I wanted it to be but still enjoyable for a casual evening out with friends. THe interior is cozy and comfy and almost feels like you're sitting in a friends house.
Drinks were good, I had a dirty martini.
Started off with meatballs and Brussel sprouts for apps. Meatballs were bland to me but the sprouts were tasty. I had the ravioli for dinner- this was good but served as a single large ravioli. Regardless it was tasty. The other diner had the halibut special which was also good but slightly overdone. 
The patio looks promising and I'll certainly come back in the summer for another go at the menu."}
{"text":"Love the grilled brussel sprouts and pizza here!! There is a really cool vibe and great restoration."}
{"text":"We chose 1815 Tavern for dinner because I heard there was happy hour on Saturday which I thought was outstanding! There was NO happy hour menu to be found so we didn't know what we could order and our waiter told us nothing. All we knew was that the \"flatbreads\" were part of the deal.
The atmosphere was really nice and the food was excellent however we ended up paying $16 for a pizza that we would not have gotten if we knew it wasn't included. 
The other pizzas were only $8. Would have been nice if it was written on a sign or menu so we would not be so confused. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"So upset!!! Usually LOVE this place. Went Sunday with my family from out of town. I have been raving about this food since it opened, my family wanted to try it. The service was TERRIBLE!! The food was UNDER COOKED!!! And were there for 3 hours!!! Omg!!! I ordered water but never got a glass, my strip steak was RARE COLD in the middle!!! I asked for it to be med. the took it back and burnt the outside, now I have a burnt raw steak. It never came off the bill. My aunt had a cold center pork chop. Awful!!! Our green tomatoes had ZERO DRESSING  Disappointment!!!!!! NEVER GO IN A SUNDAY!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food great environment love this place, will be coming back for sure. Great for families little pricy tho but for this food and experience it worth it trust me"}
{"text":"This a newer restaurant, very nice.  Been there twice and had their pizzas.  Quite good! As the designation shows, $$$, it is a bit pricey.  But the pizzas are unique and for the occasional times well worth it."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Ohio for 28 years for the annual twins day festival. Being from New Jersey I have never found a pizza that wowed me or a pasta dish, for that matter. That all changed this year. 1815 has the BEST Pizza this side on NYC! Homemade pasta that is top notch. I made two trips for dinner in one week.  Drinks, service, atmosphere, and food all were excellent.  The first night I had a Moscow Mule as my drink, the Brussels salad as my appetizer and the White pizza for my dinner everything was perfect!   The second trips meal was  Red Sangria as my drink, Brussels salad appetizer (can you tell I really like this?) and the single ravioli.  When I read the set up of the single ravioli I was not sure what I was going to get, it was not like anything I have had before.   The flavor of the ravioli pasta was amazing and really complimented the Braised Beef, Carrots, Roasted Mushrooms (did I mention normally I do not care for mushrooms?)  the portion size was perfect.
There were Eight other people in our party (on both trips) I think just about everything on the menu was tried at least once.  There were no issues and no mistakes in our orders. Everyone raved about each item they ordered, in the end we tasted each other's food and one was just as good or better than the next.  Now to the homemade desserts we shared carrot cake, white chocolate (raspberry) cheese cake, and vanilla ice cream....Do not ask me which is the best I was floored by them all.  OK...I am partial to cheese cake but everyone else voted the carrot cake.  To all the people who live in the surrounding area you are so lucky to have such a diamond. For those who are visiting the area mark 1815 as one of your dinning destinations. I unfortunately will have to wait a year before I can enjoy all that 1815 has to offer."}
{"text":"We visited 1815T because of how great people have talked about it! It was just ok. When we were seated we weren't even asked if we wanted to sit inside or outside. If it was busy then i would understand but the place was empty! My Lemon cello Lemonade needed to be iced or chilled and our waitress could've used some warming up! Felt like we were interrupted our whole meal and it was more than your avg \"checking in\".  We had to ask for our own water. Since when is water not brought to the table. The bread was pieces of bread not slices or dinner rolls. Kind of strange. I Ordered the Brussels Salad which was very good but could have had a bit more dressing or dressing on the side. We ordered a pizza but i may have tried a dinner if i had time to look at the extravagant ingredients and menu items. The coffee brûlée had great flavor but was very mushy and there was NO crack when i broke the topping! Sadly, I dont think i would go back. Too many other choices for the price!"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to eating here, and it was good, but not as good as I thought it would be. I went there with my mom for a late dinner. She was really hungry for a burger, but unfortunately they did not have any on the menu. She settled for two appetizers, the brussel sprouts and the chicken meatballs. I got a pizza with prosciutto and and arugula pizza, which was delicious and heated up nicely the next day for lunch. However, the brussel sprouts and chicken meatballs were not top notch at all. The brussel sprouts said that they were \"wood fired with with pork cracklings and apple cider butter sauce\" -- I am not sure if wood fired means they should taste a certain way, but they were very dry and had almost no flavor to them. It was as if they had not been cooked, sauteed, roasted -- anything. The chicken meatballs were also a little tough. All being said, since it was only my first time at the place, I will happily go back and try more things on the menu."}
{"text":"Stopped in to 1815 for a late dinner with my wife.  We were greeted as we walked in and given our choice of bar or restaurant seating.  Opting for the latter, we were pleased to see that everything was clean and had a rustic feel as we approached our table for two, next to the fireplace.  The atmosphere was casual with Dave Matthews Band playing in the background.  It appears that the Tavern is a modified house, converted into a great place to eat and drink - exposed wood beams and brick.  The restrooms were really clean and well taken care of.  

We opted for a couple $13 / $14 pizzas (Margarita and Veggie).  Both were delicious - thin crust with fresh cheese on each.  The Veggie had a hint of sweetness that was not at all overpowering.  Entrée prices hovered in the mid-$20 range.  1815 has a nice beer list, both bottles and drafts; all drafts featured local Ohio beers.  We didn't have room for dessert, but heard they are all hand made from scratch.  Our server was pleasant and helpful throughout.  The glass water bottles left on the table for \"self-refills\" was a nice touch too.  We'll be back here again."}
{"text":"Stopped in on Mother's Day to check out their new brunch.  Absolutely off the hook!  Abby was our waitress and she was amazing.  Great service complimented by great food.  But I don't want to forget the highlight of the brunch, a Spicy Shrimp Mary, created by Cory, the amazing mixologist.  Check out the photo, and enough said.  What s great addition to our community.  Thank you Updykes!"}
{"text":"Great food but absolutely terrible service.    If they don't improve the service the food won't save them."}
{"text":"Passing through Aurora on a Sunday afternoon and decided to stop in for dinner. Took a chance on this place not knowing anything about it. Wow what a great place!!! My husband and I loved our experience! Our meal was excellent! We ordered a wood fired Margherita pizza with artichoke and tomato salads and homemade carrot cake for dessert. Amazing!!! We ate outside on the patio it was very comfortable and clean. The service was excellent. Our waitress was super friendly and attentive to our needs. There's entertainment on Sundays and Wednesdays at 5:00 PM on the patio. Wish we had time to stay. We will be returning to this restaurant soon. Perfect place for a relaxing date! (First review gave a 5 star rating)

Second visit was nice but the food and service weren't great. The Prosciutto and Arugula pizza was drenched in olive oil/pesto and a soggy mess to eat. The fried green tomatoes were bland, not worth eating. The best part of the experience was the entertainment the guy was fantastic! It was a beautiful day on the patio! (A 3 star rating)

Third visit not much better than the last visit. Average service, average food, nothing to brag about. The flies and bees on the patio were awful, they swarmed around us the entire time (even before the food came). It was annoying and made for a very stressful experience. The quality of the food and the high prices with average service make this place a pass by. We won't be returning. (A 2 star rating)"}
{"text":"Corey and Joe, the bartenders/ servers are awesome! Fantastic service with a personal flair! Quaint nice relaxing atmosphere entices you into the past but it's the present. Tv's around to watch the Cavs/Indians. Fried green tomatoes are excellent as well as pizzas and libations! Will definitely be a FAVE place to return to w/happy hour 4-6 seven days a week!!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent place with an excellent ambience !! Nice people and a great bar atmosphere !! Food choices and wine selections were excellent and very reasonably priced !! Thanks to Ryan who made sure we were having a great time !! Will most definitely recommend this place !! 

Thx

DR MD"}
{"text":"This was a complete disappointment! We have been here before on the patio and had a wonderful experience.... but not this time. It was a crowded Saturday night and there were no reservations for the dinning room. We decided to sit in the bar. What a mistake!!! There were two bartenders, moving at a snails pace. We waited 10 minutes before they acknowledged us and then took one order at a time. We had others join us about 39 mins later who weren't served without my husband having to go find her. Seats at the bar became available and we were told they were reserved....RESERVED AT THE BAR.  By the end of the night we were a party of 8, and were were served once! We notice smaller parties being served on a more regular basis, and concluded they were regulars. When we finally were served, both bartenders were rude with attitudes. It was the worst experience which is too bad, we live close, like the atmosphere and the foods good. Complete disappointment!!!"}
{"text":"The building was built in 1815 and I believe the food was still left over from that time period. Iwanted to order wine which we had to ask server twice.. We ordered muscles the bread that was supposedly flat was like a rock cold hard no taste whatsoever my main order was stuffed flounder and it was like mush like it was cooked in boiling water. if you didn't have any teeth will be a perfect dish for you that was like eating nothing no taste whatsoever the stuffing I have no idea what it was I couldn't eat it. My wife's had bacon sirloin the bacon was soggy and unedible. The waitress never refilled bread never refilled our water pitcher.we waited 15 minutes for server to pick up our payment.she broke wine opener in bottle and couldnt figure out how to remove it from next table.had to ask for dessert.it was like begging for service. For 140 bucks i could have 70 fish sandwiches at mcds which i know are better."}
{"text":"Delicious food and a nice atmosphere. I had the open faced ravioli. It was amazing! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We've been here 50 times at least! They always provide great service and wonderful meals! It's our go to summertime outdoor hangout and they make a great Tito's Mule!"}
{"text":"Always good food! Always good times! 
We LOVE sitting at the beautiful bar and chatting with other locals!  Everyone is so friendly.  Cory makes the best Bourbon drinks and Emma's margaritas are the BOMB!!
Best place in Aurora!!!"}
{"text":"Oh how I really want to like this restaurant. We went on a Friday in August for my birthday. This was the second time we had gone here with a reservation...and the second time our table wasn't ready. Two people tried to convince us to eat on the patio..but it was raining. Nope. 
When we were finally seated, our college aged waitress never told us the specials. We were inquiring about some appetizers...she brought us one we never ordered. And another. We paid for two appetizers and only wanted one. But to be honest, they were the best part of the evening: Fried green tomatoes and the cheese plate. 
I had the salmon with Bok choy and the Bok choy was awful. Soggy and tasteless. No effort at all was put into this side. 
My husband and daughter had two beef based dishes that pretty much used the same beef with a different presentation. The \"open faced ravioli\" was  a joke. Shredded beef with a undercooked piece of pasta on top of it. 
They were out of some of the desserts ... Which we didn't find out until after we'd ordered them. 
We had to beg for salt and pepper and were never asked if we wanted more wine or beverages. 
This was our second visit and I can't say that I'd recommend it...such a shame because I REALLY wanted to like this restaurant."}
{"text":"Really good; will definitely be back.  Had the wedge salad and a sausage pizza; both were unique and really tasty.  Prices were slightly higher than what I was expecting but well-within the range for such a nice place with such great food.  Service was excellent.  We were seated indoors in the dining area but I walked through the property; the bar had seating at the bar along with a few stand-up tables; there was a really nice outdoor patio with a gas firepit that looked really inviting.  Will need to return and explore the rest of the entrees; the menu isn't too small or too large and there are a number of really interesting entrees available."}
{"text":"We are regulars to this place coming in at least once a month.... Our last visit was not very good. We sat for 10/15min before a waitress came to the table. We ordered beers, took another 15min to get our beers. Waitress never brought water to the table while we waited. Placed our order finally after flagging our waitress down because she seemed to be avoiding our table after another 15min. We ordered the 'white' pizza. Took forever for the food to come out and when she brought it to the table it was the incorrect pizza leading to another lengthy wait for our food. Was never asked for a refill on my beer... Food was good, but very poor service..."}
{"text":"This is the sixth time I've tried this place and every time, it's the same.  Really slow service, mediocre food and of course expensive food.  A $12 omelette and another $2.50 for toast?  Seriously?  I don't know where the people who rate this place 4 and 5 stars are coming from.  It's a very nice atmosphere, but the food and service are amateur at best.  We've been done with our meal for 15 minutes and we haven't seen the server.  I put my wallet and credit card on the table 10 minutes ago, but no one has gotten the hint.  And there are only about 18 people in the restaurant.  The atmosphere is the only reason for an additional star.  Just had to flag someone down to pay the bill.  Ugh."}
{"text":"What a great a new addition to Aurora! The food was superb, sophisticated, and up there with the latest food trends. The restaurant itself is a refurbished home, and a historical relic.

I'd recommend the crispy shrimp tempura, and scallops for starters, and the fall-off-the-bone pork shank for the entree. They have a cool bar area, great drink selections, and unique cocktails.

This is good eats if you're in town!"}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere and service was excellent. The owner John came to our table to introduce himself and when he found out my husband loves a good bourbon he offered to show my husband the burbon selection, which was excellent. I had the special halibet and brussel sprouts. My husband had the pizza and eveything was wonderful. We will go back again."}
{"text":"I have been to 1815 on several occasions and have never been disappointed.  Tonight was sufficiently disappointing to post this review...not only was the pizza disappointing but the restaurant's response was worse.  Ordered the artichoke and bacon pizza; unfortunately it had little to no bacon. In fact my wife and I found one small piece on the entire pizza.  My wife was a waitress in college so we are very accommodating to wait staff.  Very nicely (and with some good natured kidding) pointed out the lack of bacon to the waitress. She very sweetly told us she'd tell the cook.  No response afterwards.  Got the bill including full price for \"artichoke and bacon pizza\" and made another friendly remark about a bacon pizza that had virtually no bacon.  I could have legitimately refused to pay for the pizza but did not and gave the waitress a decent tip.  She picked up the bill and said nothing about the lousy pizza.
So either she told her boss and management didn't care or she didn't say anything about it.
Either one is a problem.
I wouldn't recommend this restaurant after this and by all means, don't expect bacon on your bacon and artichoke pizza!"}
{"text":"Best place in Aurora to catch up with old friends, meet new ones, and enjoy some great, classic food, prepared with outstanding flavor profiles.  White pizza and pepper on pizza are amazing and fresh out a wood fired stove.  Best in Aurora!  Plus, the happy hour from 4-6 Monday - Friday should be something everyone makes an effort to check out.  Great specials in the bar area!"}
{"text":"This review is for their Sunday brunch.  I have not yet been to this restaurant for anything else.  This location is new, owned by the owners of Mad Jacks's, just up the street.  Nice ambiance for brunch.  We chose to sat outside, since the weather was good, but there is also indoor seating.  The spicy shrimp mary (think cross between shrimp cocktail and bloody mary) is excellent.  Their mimosas are great and they also have a grapefruit mimosa.  Entrees are great.  The salmon benedict and shrimp and grits are great.  If you have a hearty appetite or are sharing with a friend, get the breakfast pizza.  You will also receive a small, freshly baked blueberry muffin with your meal.  Service was attentive.   There were a few minor flaws in execution that kept this from receiving 5 stars, but perhaps after a few more months they will be corrected.  Worth a visit for Sunday Brunch!"}
{"text":"For starters, the building has been there since 1815 (hence, the name!), yet it is beautifully updated. The inside is really sophisticated for such a historic building. They have a nice roaring fireplace, tufted seating, pretty 1815 branding on everything from the tables to the water glasses, and plenty of open spaces. The inside is surprisingly huge. You can come here for a quaint little date or bring a large party of people. The parking is also super easy.

Their farm-to-table menu has a really thoughtful selection of upscale entrees. I had the pork shank (which comes with brussels and spaetzle) and Mom had the scallop fettuccine. Both were to die for. My pork basically fell off the bone with barely a touch, as it should be! I had a bite of my Mom's scallops, and they were juicy and fresh, not frozen (cue happy dance!). Not to mention, HUGE portions. Yes, the 1815 is expensive, but the entree sizes are so large that you will indisputably have an entirely second meal for later. We didn't have any drinks, but their inventive drink menu certainly had some delicious sounding options. Our server was also super friendly and beyond attentive, especially because we were the only customers in there! If you hit it at 4pm or sooner, you'll have the place to yourself. After 5pm+, they are rightfully packed!

Sorry, Aurora, for always thinking you didn't have any restaurants. The 1815 Tavern has changed my mind! We loved sitting by the fireplace and having a quiet early dinner."}
{"text":"Meh. Small portions, pricey, but the food was tasty. No chicken on the menu?! (I think they have a chickien/pasta dish, but thats it.) Nice patio, but the rain precluded us from using it."}
{"text":"Brand new Aurora HistoricRestaurant! They have done a nice job converting an old historic building into a beautiful restaurant. The food is good, the service is a little rusty but getting better and I highly recommend it"}
{"text":"5/13/18 Wood fired sprouts were very good and plenty of them. Pizza and house meatballs were also good. House pastrami short ribs are unusual and tasty, just wish it wasn't swimming in juice. It was almost like eating a bowl of soup. Overall good experience."}
{"text":"1815 is the best. The food is always great and the atmosphere is nice especially in the summer. Their veggie burger is delicious and so are some other sandwiches and salads. There is an affordable wine and beverage selection as well."}
{"text":"Favorite wood fire pizza in the area. Pancetta w/ arugula & mushroom are my favorite by far. The bar has a good bourbon selection that includes Blanton's. Go on a clear night and enjoy the patio that includes a fire pit."}
{"text":"Amazing pizzas, craft beer selection, great bourbon and liquor choices. Menu is so fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"In a word - meh. Went on a Sunday, before the big dinner crowd. We chose to eat inside. To say the service was slow would be an understatement. After a good 15-20 minute wait the waitress came over to take our drink orders. Told us she had just arrived and didn't know the specials and would have to get back to us. We had to ask for water.  Expected better service and better food for all the rave reviews.  The pear martini was good so I'll give them that. Most likely will not visit this place again."}
{"text":"I want to give it a better review but unfortunately it was a bit of a weird experience. We spent most of the night waiting lucky we where seated faster than it took to get food. I think the Waite staff may be understaffed alltogether. Our waitress was very friendly and gave us desert for the mess up.
We ordered appetizers which didn't take alot of time to come out which is good because it almost took 2 hours to get out pizzas and we were hungry. I got the mussles and my wife got the fried green tomatos. All very good after sitting about 45 minutes the lady comes out to tell us they didn't cook our pizzas for some reason and that they are starting on them now we are about a half hour from closing time and everyone's running around cleaning everything up and we got there 2 and a half hours before closing pizza came finally so we rushed to eat most came back to the hotel and the waitress brings us free dessert for the mess up over all the experience wasn't bad the food is good the pizzas arnt worth the price."}
