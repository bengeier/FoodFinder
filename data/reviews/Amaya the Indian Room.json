{"text":"Amazing. Everytime I go I love it more. Great recommendations by the staff, always impressed with specials, and the menu pulls from a variety of India's cultural regions.

The staples that I think are comparable between Toronto Indian places (as a goofy white-guy) are: 
- Butter Chicken: There's is great, very rich, best Ive had. 
- Chicken Korma: Also great, very good flavours
- Lamb Vindaloo: Best in Toronto, hands down. Everywhere else I've gone has given spice or flavour, never had one deliver both. Excellent flavour, perfect heat. And having it served as an in-tact shank is beautiful. 

Also, if you like chai tea stick around and have some. Bottomless glass for $2, and it is traditional and perfect."}
{"text":"Overall, just ok. 

Parking: You need park in the sidestreets. There is also a green P in the street across from it but not too many spaces..

Decor: Place was nicer and hipper than most Indian places. That said, it is a small space, and the tables are a bit cramped. A woman on an adjacent table was talking loudly and we could hear the full details of her story.

Food: we had the beef tenderloin (fair- not that good), butter chicken (good), lentil (very good), garlic naan (good), and basmati rice (fair). For two, ordered way too much. Could have done without the beef tenderloin. 

Price: Thought it was a bit pricier than the regular Indian resto. Around 15-20 per entree, for portions that are good for 2-3 people sharing. (We ordered 3 entrees, we had some food to take home). We had a groupon, so that helped.

I probably wouldnt go out of my way to come back here. Thought Tandoori House and Agra (near Yonge and Sheppard) had better food options, and better price point."}
{"text":"I had a great time here for Winterlicious.  The service was incredible and being slightly new to Indian cuisine, I was very pleased to see how the menu had some great \"intro\" dishes.  I didn't feel intimidated at all.  

I totally recommend this restaurant for a date or a group of friends."}
{"text":"Good modern indian cuisine, although not always consistent. This was the place to eat in midtown when it opened, but the quality has finished considerably. They now even have an \"all you can eat\" option, which says a lot in my mind."}
{"text":"Worst delivery service ever!! Order at least an hour and half before you actually need the food. They will charge your credit card and the customer service will tell you that the restaurant is closed. You are left with the uncertainty of ordering food from other restaurants or wait. Not acceptable!!"}
{"text":"This place has really good Indian food!
I've had their food court food many times, but their formal dining is better!
Got the lamb lollipops main and Briyani with lamb. 
When they say it's their signature dish, they were not kidding. The lamb racks were cooked to perfection. Tender, flavourful, with a bit of char. The sauce is heaven. Highly recommended! The Briyani portion was huge! It is covered with a layer of dough, which I used as bread for dipping the lamb lollipops sauce. It was served piping hot and there are lots of fresh ingredients and nuts inside. 
All in all their food is absolutely lovely! It is on the pricier side but on the other hand I left very satisfied with spending the money and will surely be back!"}
{"text":"As I stand here holding my fiancé's hair, I can't help but wish the staff at this restaurant had done a more thorough job of observing her food allergies. We clearly stated to our waiter that she has a serious nut allergy and he insisted that all the food we ordered was safe for her.... Somewhere along the line someone messed up or she wouldn't be throwing up right now from the food we shared. The best part was when they insisted that we had made a mistake and everything on their end was clear... Clearly, our mistake was coming here in the first place.
I'm just beginning to introduce my fiancé to the pleasures of Indian cuisine, and after an amazing start with her at the Tikka House in Little India, this was an unfortunate follow up.
I have to say that food allergy aside, the food was really below average, there are much better Indian food experiences to be had in other parts of town.
We won't be back or recommending it."}
{"text":"Best Indian food I have had in the city !  Great for take put or dine in. Fresh and flavorful is how I would describe it. Service in the restaurant is friendly and makes me want to keep coming back."}
{"text":"Take-Out lamb vindaloo and butter chicken. 

The portions were large, however, there was very little lamb / chicken contained in the serving. The butter chen was very well prepared. The lamb in the vindaloo was tough to chew and the sauce/gravy was not very mature. The spices, in the vindaloo, we're not well blended. There was plenty of heat, however, vindaloo needs more flavour depth than heat.  The offering fell flat to my taste. 

I may try again, as the location is convenient, however, if the same experience persist it will be my final visit."}
{"text":"The savory chat and garlic nann is to die for. If the savory chat is not on the menu you can always request it and they will make it for you."}
{"text":"Nothing is better than a fully belly before bed!
Summerlicious 2009, our friend suggested Amaya for a get-together over food. Needless to say we group of friends are hearty eaters and love Indian food (well, we love any type of food!).
Walking into Amaya, you get a wonderful waft of all the goodness that is being cooked up in the kitchen. It's a relatively small restaurant, which I image is typical of restaurants in the Bayview & Eglington area. 
We were seated in the back right outside the kitchen, normally, that doesn't make people enjoy their experience, but we had front row seats to the view into what the chefs were doing. We were right next to a big viewing window into the kitchen and the only bad thing that sitting there did was make our mouths water even more.
We all had the $25 Summerlicious menu, which we were told was made up of the most popular dishes that Amaya had to offer. Our table had the Palak Patte Kui Chaat, as well as the Subx Bhar for starters, the Masala Lime Lamb and the Butter Chicken for the entrees and then Rasmalai with Pistachio and Rice Pudding. We ordered extra naan (Plain, Garlic as well as the Butter) because we love scooping up every last drop of sauce. Everything was oh so wonderful! The menu had many other things that we all wanted to try as well and I think they would have all been as tasty.
That said, we didn't leave the restaurant until 11pm and by that time we were all ready for bed. It's always a nice feeling to be full and just ready to roll into bed after a really good meal!
What is also nice is that they have a take-out/delivery menu and a few locations. I WILL go back to Amaya!"}
{"text":"Oh Goddamn! I love their Naan Tokri (assorted Tandoor oven roasted naan) especially the one with lots of roasted garlic on it. Their Saag Paneer is TO DIE FOR & their Butter Chicken was a tad on the sweet side but it had big juicy chunks of chicken and I went with my sister who bought a voucher from WagJag ($40 worth of food for $20 excluding tip, taxes, etc). We almost wound up not using it on time because it expires soon but she is so busy with work, our playdates (or our plans for them) hardly ever materialize. 

Currently on the prowl for more vouchers but I would dine here again without! SO GOOD! Super full. The prices are crazy for some items (espesh the libations) but I still want to try everything. Might consider the Prix Fixe menu next time. I could never come here myself. I simply couldn't justify the expense. Then again, I rarely ever order anything outside the $1.39 Value Picks menu at McDonald's. It is beautifully dimly lit, the washrooms are clean, the paper towels are awesome... basically, the only thing I hated there were the sliding locks on the restroom doors that were fairly difficult to manoeuver without pinching my fat fingers/the constant looming threat of internal bleeding. 

The pre-warmed earthenware plates were a very thoughtful added touch. The waiters on duty at the time of my visit were cute as hell & I don't think I could ever eat instant/fake frozen supermarket-grade Indian food out of a box ever again! It's a pity their food court food leaves much to be desired. I didn't like their sister restaurant on Mt. Pleasant (Bazaar Global Food Bar... which probably closed down) AT ALL. However, THIS place is amazing! It almost made me join Instagram. I still have the mother of all regrets for not taking a photo of the colourful delicious food we inhaled/almost choked on-- & my sister is practically Instagram royalty. I guess we were both waaay too hungry!"}
{"text":"Not necessarily home-style Indian cooking, but if you are looking for high-end, delicious Indian food, this is the place to be!  The dishes are creative but stay within the realm of authentic Indian cuisine (none of that fusion stuff), and everything tastes and is presented perfectly.  The best Indian restaurant in TO, in my opinion!"}
{"text":"Very solid leaside resto. Exciting take on traditional indian dishes. Decent wine list, good service. Busy so a reservation is recommended. The dishes are slightly on the high side in terms of price. However, the food is top quality and you will not leave disappointed."}
{"text":"My first experience with Amaya was through a Groupon deal the GF purchased.
We went with another couple who lives close by who swore by it.

My parents love fancy Indian food, there favourite restaurant outside of Swiss Chalet, is the Host in Yorkville

My first experience was so good that I had to show them what the new wave of Indian Restaurants tastes like.

Which brings us to Friday night, it was my mom's birthday and what better way to ring it in, then with Vindaloo and wine.

Note: Make reservations for the weekends! I booked almost 3 weeks in advance and still couldn't get anything for 730. My options were 630 or 830. 

Ambiance:
Little restaurant with great decor. Feels very intimate.  I think I can safely say, from all the Indian restaurants I have been to, this is one of the best decors. Very busy on a Friday night, but feels very warm and inviting.

Food:
I will break down each item one by one just so you get the full effect. And also as I have been yelping more and more, I am running out of adjectives to describe food!

Appetizers:
Prawns: These prawns were some incredible sauce, they weren't super big but really juicy and flavorful. My pops loves the Prawns at the host, which are in a Tan-door and then plated on a sizzler. He wouldn't admit it, but I saw a little something in his eye that showed he liked this a little better.

Bang Bang Fish: These are not your usual Fish Pakoras from a banquet hall, this is grade A fish, I would equate it to the Indian style of Fish and Chips (minus the Chips). The fish was tender and flaky, not a dry piece in the batch.

Lamb Lollipops(Lamb Chops) - This is the other item my pops loves the Host for. Granted the Lamb Chops at the host, are one of the best. They have an amazing marinade, and again cooked in a tan-door and served on a sizzler. I'd say these are just as good, but a different in flavour. The marinade isn't very rich in its Indian flavours, the sauce is, but not the marinade itself. At Amaya, they are pan fried or grilled I think, which make them cooked to perfection. A nice pink hue. The ones at the host are a little over cooked, but there marinade is bomb.

Dinner:
Beef Vindaloo - Nice and Spicy!! Great flavour.The Beef tenderloin was again cooked immaculately. Nice and pink. So tender and juicy.

Parsi Ribs - I would say the sauce is delicious, the ribs are OK, kind of fatty pulled pork style. I am not a big fan of pulled meat in general. Sauce was similar to the vindaloo

Ginger Chicken Curry - Really good and flavourful. No complaints here. 

Lamb Biryani - Great. Not a big biryani fan, but this was tasty.

Garlic Naan - Like anyone, I love a good pillowy naan, but at amaya they take a little different approach.  Their naans are a little lighter and crispier, but just as good. I actually appreciate them more since it didn't leave me feeling so weighed down after the meal.

All in all, Amaya is my top Indian Restaurant, I haven't been to some listed here like Kama Sutra yet, but it will take a lot for me to be swayed after two delicious dining experiences at Amaya.

oh and one last thing:
Sauce Factor: Spicy and Wonderful - All of it. I could drink there Vindaloo curry!"}
{"text":"I went to Amaya with 3 friends on a Saturday night.  The place was packed!  We had a reservation for 8:30pm and it took at least 15 minutes to seat us because every table was taken and some people stayed longer than they anticipated.

We ordered a curry lamb, a spinach paneer, a chicken tikka masala, and a chicken briyani.  They all tasted great!  After eating it, I could see why the place was so full.  My only problem was the pricing.  I felt the veggie items were reasonable around $11 each, but the briyani seemed steep at $17-$18 and the meat items were also in that approximate range.

I would definitely go again, but I probably cannot afford to go too often!"}

Fresh Yoghurt Egg was filled with pomegranate juice

Prawn Papdi Chaat with cumin and chutney- this is one of their street food, similar to Mexican ceviche but with cooked shrimp.

Kale Pakora with tomato chutney, this is something I didn't think I would like but oh man was it delicious! It was crispy and seasoned just right, and I couldn't get enough of the tomato chutney that was in the jar.

Amaya Prawns, were juicy and bursting with flavor with green mango curry sided beetroot gel.

Pani Puri, which means fried bread + water was something I've never had before. Basically what you do is fill the fried bread (sitting on top) with the flavored water thats in the tiny jug and pop it in your mouth! It was really fun to eat, although a little messy.

Lamb with avocado icecream, was something I look forwarded to. Really? avocado ice cream with lamb? But yes really, avocado icecream was nutty and complimented the tender lamb pieces.

Gold Medal Scallops with pickled lemons, shallot confit and coconut snow. 

Eggplant steak, this was probably one of my top 3 favorite dishes. Served in mustard yogurt sauce and onion chip, eggplant was cooked just right the sauce was so fragrant.

Bacon and Tenderloin Kulcha & Chili Olive Naan, this is a must order! It's like I never knew naan bread until now where I stuck with plain or garlic- stuffed with bacon and tenderloin kulcha or chili olive (if you are a olive lover) this is naan on whole different dimension.

Chicken Korma with herb oil

Lamb Biryani, very cute presentation with all the biryani stuffed in Roasted butternut squash. The butternut squash is fully cooked so you can eat the insides too.

Paneer Tikka, served like piece of butter is a must if you love cheese. I also couldn't get enough of that coconut whip on the side.

Carrot Cake Mousse & Kulfi Icecream for dessert

Summary: It's no doubt I enjoyed all the food served at Amaya the Indian Room. There were so many innovative dishes that I didn't even know about and it's always nice to walk into a restaurant and try something new other than your ordinary butter chicken (not that there is anything wrong with good butter chicken!).
The dishes are a little pricier than your ordinary Indian restaurants, but sometimes we deserve a treat and the quality ingredients do make a big difference- so drop by Amaya the Indian Room and give them a try, cause I am def going back!"}
{"text":"We took the old family to Amaya for a interesting introduction to Indian food. First of all I have to write a disclaimer, I have only had Indian food three times in my life. At Amaya we ate the taster menu because we just had no idea what to order. The servings were just right and we got a good idea of the different tastes Indian food offers. The butter chicken was excellent and all of the dishes were quite tasty and perfect for half of my family who can't take the heat. I on the other hand prefer spicier foods so I would have appreciated the cook pushing the threshold up a notch or two. I am sure he would have done so if we had asked. The only real complaint I had was when the server served the dishes he did not speak loud enough for me to understand him. I know I know, I could have told him to speak up....Also I should note this is not per se a kid's restaurant...it was crowded and loud but the baby faired well...."}
{"text":"omg one of the best Indian restaurant experiences I've had in the city!! my mom and I decided on the chef's tasting menu which was really really worth it
it's $45 per person but don't worry because it's totally worth it, the variety is amazing and the portions were so big, I had to doggy bag the entrees 
I'm vegetarian and my mom isn't so they accommodated that really nicely 
the menu was all a surprise and consisted of three appetizers! and a whole bunch of small bowls on different entrees with rice and lots of yummy naan, followed by dessert 
there's the option of having it all paired with wine too which sounds lovely because it curated by a sommelier!! 
so it's a definite recommend and wonderful service and very high quality food 
enjoy!"}
{"text":"The problem here is that I happen to travel to Brampton on a regular basis where delicious, authentic and affordable Indian food is plentiful.  As a result, I was rather disappointed with my meal at Amaya, especially after hearing glowing things about the restaurant and reading such positive reviews.

On the plus side, the atmosphere and decor of the restaurant is what I'd describe as cozy-riche.  The interior design paired with votives at each table make for a warm and inviting scene.  The service was also very helpful and thorough with plate changes between services and crumb removal before desert.  Everything was pretty good all the way to the complimentary cumin toasted papadum served with a sweet mango sauce on the side as an appetizer.  

My companion was not very adventurous and ordered the butter chicken - the Canadian staple of Indian food, while I ordered the eggplant steak.  The butter chicken was far more tart than buttery, and the chicken itself was on the dry side.  The eggplant, while interesting, was not a dish I would want to order again.  The naan was okay, not terrible, but there were a lot of thin patches throughout each piece, leaving very few bites with that satisfying chewy bliss that I usually get from it.  

All of the above would have been an okay experience if it were not for the price.  Since it is an above-average priced restaurant, I expect the food to be above average as well.

Luckily the meal ended with a high when I ordered Greg's roasted marshmallow ice cream for desert.  

I'm sure there are people who will enjoy this restaurant and the food they serve.  Unfortunately, I am not one of them."}
{"text":"Everyone in my family loves Indian food and we all think this is by far the best we've had in Toronto. We were there quite a few times and each time we would eat so much that we could barely move afterwards (for 3 people we usually order 3 appetizers and 4 main dishes as well as additional rice and naan, the portions are big but we just can't get enough of the food here! We''re all tiny people but we always finish everything.)"}
{"text":"This is my third visit, and I'd still go back. Probably b/c we had a Groupon as the prices for Indian aren't what one would typically expect. However, the menu isn't what you'd expect either. However, the creativity and change on the menu is what would likely keep us coming if we found a deal again.

Street food starter included pakora & samosa. Nice dips included too. Very good.
Bass main course: bass cooked beautifully and perfectly. Soft & smooth... Sauce was good.
Beetroot veg dish: a pleasant surprise to have Indian style beets. Would eat this again.
Beet basmati rice: ok... didn't taste the beets much, I'd stick with the regular rice and save the $1 next time.

That was a lot of food already... No room for dessert! I'd go back again."}
{"text":"I went here during winterlicious twice and loved it each time. The first time I went with my father who is, like me, in no way an expert of east Indian food. He had some sort of chicken appetizer and for his main course he had the fish and loved it!! I had the eggplant for my appetizer which was very good and for my main I had the golden jewel or something..? The name had to do with a jewel or something precious. Either way it was a chicken dish and it was to die for!! The rice was perfectly done as well. For dessert I had the ice cream and soared every last bit. Daddio had the mango cheesecake which I though was okay, the cheesecake drizzle on top made it. That part was wonderful! 
The second time I went I took my partner with me who is West Indian and thought that the food was amazing as well. My partner had the chicken appetizer and the same chicken that I had had last time as well as the mango cheesecake. He thought that it was all sublime, and better than other East Indian dining establishments that he had been to. I had the lentil soup, which was delicious and the butter chicken, which was not what I was expecting but still good. We adored this place and will definitely be coming back in the near future!!"}
{"text":"\"A beautiful girl does not need a lot of make up\". Similarly, \"if you have beautiful ingredients, you don't need to do too much with them\", shares Hemant Bhagwani, mastermind behind Toronto restaurant, Amaya Restaurant. For Bhagwani, whether in business or on the menu, it's about always trying something new, but \"the key must always be good quality ingredients. That has to be the base of everything\".

Born in northern India, but fascinated by Indian southern cooking, Bhagwani trained in Switzerland, Syndney, Dubai, and Toronto, enjoyed successes and endured struggles along the way. He observed Indian dining in London, England, and realized what Toronto was lacking. Never wanting to do a buffet, Bhagwani has since elevated Indian cuisine in Toronto. From his first restaurant opening in Brampton years ago, Bhagwani now maintains sixteen Amaya restaurants, as well as a line of sauces and naan bread.

So here we are at Amaya tasting their new menu, and we are wowed by the creativity and diversity of colour, flavour and texture from lamb tenderloin with wasabi ice cream to saffron chicken korma with pistachios, orange and kumquat. There is quite a range of cooking here. Crunchy kale and spinach fritters, smoky chicken tikka with a refreshing coriander foam, and plump Amaya prawns lavished with green mango curry. All delectable teasers.

Eggplant steak is stuffed with potatoes, peppers, carrots and asparagus in a mild mustard based sauce. Tender beef short-rib is nourished in a curry perfumed with cinnamon and cumin; and roast lobster sits atop colourful citric beet rice. There is an interesting juxtaposition of sweet and spice that harmonizes on each plate. Biryani, presented in an earthenware pot and covered by a layer of naan is cut open tableside to reveal a wonderful medley of baked aromas and ingredients including lamb and nuts. A variety of naan bread from garlic, to chili and olive, allows us to soak up all the wonderful curries before us, and then, \"pow\", we're hit with hot spice, so a cucumber raita serves as our fire extinguisher.

For dessert, ice cream is not to be missed. Prepared a la minute with liquid nitrogen, before our very eyes we watch this lab experiment result in a pretty display of rosewater ice cream with crushed pistachio, cardamom powder, saffron caviar and blueberry sauce. Light, airy, and delicately flavoured, this molecular gastronomy reflects the imagination of Bhagwani, his passion for flavour and texture, and his forward thinking to create and define new possibilities of Indian cuisine."}
{"text":"I came here yesterday on a Saturday with reservation for a party of 8. We came here base on a friend's suggestion from a review she read.

The decor was nice but I found the room too dark. I understand they're trying to create ambiance but I would like to see what I'm putting in my mouth.  All the curries started do look the same color. Plus side is that restaurant didn't have a strong smell of Indian food.

Service was attentive but I didn't like that they kept on up selling more food when we ordered one Currie dish each. Not sure if Indians eat a lot but we had a lot leftover at the end. I felt they started to upsell when we didn't order a bottle of wine but 5 of us did order a glass of wine/beer/cocktail each. The restaurant did seem a little slow,  probably due to freezing storm warning and there trying to make enough to cover their overhead. 

The menu wasn't big and there's something for everyone. Our group decided to go family style and share. Portions were big. They gave us complimentary appetizer that was some sort of fried lentil. For appetizers,  we ordered samosas and vegetarian pakora. The samosa was not hot when it came out, not the same when it's not freshly fried (samosa king's still better) The pakora was a fried vegetable of some sort and tasted okay (looked like mini burgers with no buns) The curries (butter chicken, mushroom,  shrimp, lamb, spicy chicken, and scallops) was mediocre as I've had better at Bombay Bhel. The chicken was dry and that should be done to perfection as curries are usually cooked with chicken. Out of all of the curries I like the mushroom,  it was different and tasted good. In addition, we ordered fish in banana leaf, it was delicious as it didn't smell fishy and had lots of flavour.

Overall,  it's a nice fancy restaurant to bring first timers. It's nice and modern. Fusion inspired,  if your into it. I minus the 2 stars due do up selling,  cold samosas, chicken overcooked and price. We paid a total of $280 with gratuities included due to large group. Bombay Bhel is way better and cheaper."}
{"text":"A perfectly nice dining experience.  Service is good and the decor of the restaurant is chic and warm at the same time.  But the quality of the food (even though decent) just doesn't match the prices.  It's the kind of place to go if you want to impress your date with ambiance, rather than dive into authentic Indian cuisine.

We had the Winterlicious menu and it was quite tasty.  No complaints, just nothing really stood out as terrific.  My husband had the pakoras and I had the butternut squash soup.  His app was quite small (two pakoras sitting on top of some slaw) and mediocre.  Nothing like the crispy, oniony, fragrant morsels I've had at other places (ahem...Banjara).  My soup was quite good, though.  It had a great spicy kick to it and was rich with flavour.  Decent portion, too.  

Our mains were also good, but oddly portioned.  I ordered the butter chicken.  If I wasn't pregnant and craving sugar right now, I'd probably complain that it was too sweet, but frankly I lapped it up.  My husbands vegetarian Buddha meal was three times the size of my butter chicken for the same price.  Chana Masala, Dahl Mahkenhi and Saag Paneer all in individual serving dishes.  Each dish was good - although VERY heavy on the cream - but we thought it was odd that the portion sizes were so different.

Dessert was a total disappointment.  My rice pudding was like rice-based oatmeal.  Goopy and unappealing.  And it's garnish was a compote made with dried cranberries, which seemed like a decision to cut costs.  I ate two spoonfuls and left the rest.  My husband's dessert, a haagen-dazs bar was...well...a little haagen-dazs bar on a plate.  Cute.  But can't give the restaurant much credit for that one.

There are so many great Indian places in this city.  Keep exploring, I say.  

Vegetarian score: 7/10 - fewer choices than at most Indian restaurants because the menu is smaller than most (because it's \"fusion\"?)  But you'll have no difficulty getting a satisfying meal and some choice."}
{"text":"We've been getting take-out from Amaya for a couple of years and have always enjoyed it.  However, the last two times, even through all those lovely spices, all we can taste is salt.  Way too much salt, leaving all of us parched and unhappy.  The samosas are literally rolled in salt. I won't be ordering from them ever again.  Too bad, because it means more cooking for me!"}
{"text":"Classy place. Great service. Good Food.

The place was a bit dark (I guess good for dates) and the decor was trendy and pleasing to the eye. I liked the chandeliers, which gave off some cool shadows off the ceilings.

The service was great from the start at the front door to the end at getting the bill. Always attentive to our water glass and clearing finished dishes out of our way. It was a full restaurant and managed to keep the service and food out on a timely basis.

I had the Cheese Burger Samosa, the ribs, butter chicken, and naan (we were all sharing by the way). The samosa's were exceptionally good and got me wanting more but I could be biases because of my love for cheese burgers. The ribs were a bit fatty but still got the texture and taste there to make me satisfied. The butter chicken were surprisingly a bit spicy but the chicken fell flat and dry. The plain naan were just okay but the garlic naan were a big disappointment due to burnt garlic.

Overall, the experience was good but there were some misses in the food price and taste that just made this place a 3 star in my books. I would definitely come back if I was in the area."}
{"text":"I was really pleased with the food at Amaya. The staff at Amaya greeted us with a welcome amuse bouche which was a delicious watermelon/mint drink with a small pakora topped with some delicious chutneys. We then had some pappadams. I love how Amaya makes their pappadams into little celery-like logs which are much easier to eat than the round roti style ones. This way, you can load them up with chutney and not make a mess everywhere :)

For dinner, we tried the saag paneer, bhagan bharta, aloo gobi, heirloom tomato butter chicken, and the three different types of naan. Everything was so delicious! I particularly liked the saag paneer -- it tasted so fresh and creamy and just perfectly pureed. The bhagan barta was also very tasty and very creative. I found the whole meal to be excellent. 

The service was also extremely friendly and attentive. I'm looking forward to the next time I get to dine at Amaya! :)"}
{"text":"Really great- good atmosphere, delicious food- the lamb vindaloo was cooked perfectly, and the spices were lovely. The restaurant is a tad expensive, but a nice dining experience. Recommend!"}
{"text":"I love it! Come here for any special occasion. 

The windows are tinted and it's dark inside the restaurant; however, it has a certain poise to it. I truly like the decor of the dining room as it is quite modern and refreshing. The service is great; staff are all well versed in the menu and can easily help you with any questions if you are a newbie to Indian food.  As nothing can ever be perfect, one downside is the parking. Parking on Bayview is horrendous and you will get a ticket if you're not careful. For you TTC riders, you'll be worry free. Simply go to Davisville Station and take the 11 or go to Eglinton Station and take any bus that goes eastbound on Eglinton. Then walk south on Bayview.

Must haves:
- Lobster curry
- Butter chicken
- Garlic naan
- Mago Laasi"}
{"text":"This is a chic, modern Indian place that's a little more upscale and seemingly \"gourmet\" than the more traditional places commonly found in Toronto. Have someone you wanna impress with romantic vibes? And they're not an Indian food expert? Bring them here. The oriental and sensual atmosphere can definitely bring out the suave in even the most awkward ones.

First things first, the atmosphere at Amaya is top notch. It's intimate and dimly lit with tons of exotic decorations and art pieces that look straight out of a gallery or a museum. The hanging lamps only add to the mildly kama sutra vibe. When you enter this dark room you're immediately swallowed by a scent shower of aromatic Indian spices and you can stare at the colorful cushions while you wait to be seated. I'm personally into this stuff- dim lights, the right decor, faint exotic music. It all adds to your Indian experience, and Amaya definitely boasts one of the most atmospheric, intimate Indian settings in the city.

I think Amaya is a place you come for general experience rather than the sole amount of how much pleasure your taste buds get. Don't get me wrong, some dishes I ordered were simply heavenly in my mouth. However this isn't the most authentic or \"hands down the best\" Indian food you'll see in town. Appetizers are overpriced- three pieces of sliced eggplant for 8 dollars.. and the flavor was nothing too special, just the same as the other appetizers we ordered which was ram ladoo and samosa guacamole. The name samosa guacamole is actually quite misleading and left me with a little frown as there was no guacamole to be seen anywhere. If by guacamole they meant the thin, green-hued sauce drizzled on the samosas, then I'm not quite sure what to say. Unless you'd be happy with spending ten bucks on very small portioned, plain appetizers, you're better off skipping those and just sticking with the amuse-bouche that the chef brings out to every table. The naan was also quite disappointing but I didn't think too much of it because I come to Amaya more for the beautiful plates of curry that is modern blend of traditional Indian and other things I can't quite put my finger on.

 As for the mains, the lamb shank korma was the most amazing one I've ever had. Velvety is the right word for describing it- the swirling mixture of flavors was intricate and hit all the right places on my taste bud in a perfect, subtle harmony. The lamb was one of the most tender that I have tried. The lobster butter masala was under my high expectations and ended up being a little too salty for my liking, and also lacked the amazing fireworks of smooth flavors in my mouth that the lamb had. Saag paneer was much too spicy for my liking, but I still appreciated the deep, subtle flavor. Could have used a little more of that awesome chewy paneer though. And definitely less spice. Especially for a restaurant that is known for fusion, innovative Indian dishes as opposed to classical and traditional, I thought the spice was too much. Adding onto the spice level, the beef tandoori was the spiciest vindaloo dish to have ever burned my tongue. Usually I'm pretty good with spicy food, but I'd have to say this vindaloo was a big miss for me with its burning spicy level that ignorantly over cloaked every other flavor the beef had to offer.

Plating is chic and modern, menu has a chic \"gourmet\" feel to it, and service is five stars dead on. They check on you often and make sure you've got everything you need, and the staff are all very friendly and only add more smiles while you dine. The food is great, but not amazing and some plates are a miss. If you're looking for something modern with Western influences and still the exotic atmosphere, you'll like this place. If you want a hole in the wall place kind of deal with the best, authentic Indian food you'll ever find without actually having to plan a trip to India, you're better off looking for something else. Perhaps some place else a little cheaper, too. Overall, it's a nice restaurant with great staff, a wonderful atmosphere, and delicious, flavorful Indian food that's a little outside the typical Torontonian Indian box, unless you're very particular about how authentic your naan is.  I like Amaya for dates, and I will definitely be returning.. However I'll be sure to ask the server about personalizing the spice level of some of the dishes."}
{"text":"My favourite indian restaurant

Hilarious...so i kept saying Goon all night

And a wonderful Caramel Dessert

Great sized portions for such a deal where mains are $20 and apps around $10

Cool off with a lassi

always impeccable service"}
{"text":"Our go-to Indian resto. Always good service and delicious food, especially shrimp, the wondrous lassooni cauliflower, the curries, yes, the butter chicken, and the breads. Not inexpensive but the quality is great. The room is also relatively quiet and well decorated."}
{"text":"I would give 4 stars for food only but service was terrible so overall it's a 3.

We booked a table for 2 on a sunday night at 6:30pm. The restaurant wasn't full but we had to wait at least 5mins to get seated. 

We weren't offered water or any drinks or service until almost 15mins of just sitting there. We finally had to grab any server walking by to let them know we wanted something. Even that, it took him awhile to come back.

We waited at least 30mins for our food after placing the order because I saw the server forgot to punch it in. When the order came it was messed up, some things we didn't order they placed on the table and somethings that we order didn't come. We only ordered 3 things and still they can manage to mess up.

There were only a older and a younger male servers working so maybe lack of staff? 

After we were finished eating, we wanted to grab the bill and pack home the leftovers. Not surprised, it took us 15mins to get a server to do so. After asking the older server which he didn't care and forgot about it so we had to ask the other one. 

I asked for the bill and told him specifically that I need the machine because I was paying by card. He comes back 20mins later with only the bill. I told him I'm paying by card and he walks off maybe trying to look for the machine or doing something else, I don't know. 

By that time I was super fed up, it was just waiting and waiting and more waiting. Before he came back I just paid by cash leaving little tips. I don't understand why there was so much waiting when the restaurant wasn't even full.

However, besides the waiting and crappy service. The food was great! The curry was just spicy enough with a kick to it and not over powering. Naan tasted great, light and crispy. I would definitely go back again for the food itself only!!"}
{"text":"came her for summerlicious dinner last week and it was pleasant. The appetizers were displayed beautifully and my chicken something was delish! The cheese and broccoli appetizer was good too. I like the ambiance and the wait staff was very attentive to our needs. The entrees were as delicious. I had the lamb shank and my friends had the chicken curry and the seafood biryani. All delish, not one bad dish... but the chicken was a little small. We all shared and i was still hungry. 3 apps and 3 entrees and 3 desserts later i was still hungry.. well its probably better that way... i shouldn't stuff myself. I didn't pay but i hope it wasn't too expensive. This is good for groups of 4 or less and couples.. very romantic setting. I love this neighborhood too!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing; expensive but worth it! The creativity used to make there dishes was fantastic and my family is from India so I do know Indian food. There mutton bryani is amazing and unique with the naan on top"}
{"text":"When I think of Indian food, I think: \"You can't go wrong. Everywhere is the same.\" Amaya is a different story - but in a good way,  I promise. I'm usually a fan of Banjara, but Amaya offers up a more Haute look at traditional Indian food - and I like it. I went here for the last day of Summerlicious (today) for lunch. Ordered the Chicken Tikka appetizer, Crispy fish \"bento box\" and mango cheesecake. Summerlicious always means reduced servings sizes, so my hope is that these ridiculously undersized portions are normally larger - because trust me, that is the only complaint here.The chicken tikka was mouth-watering, succulent and extremely tender and I even liked the mint sauce ( I usually hate mint). The crispy fish was a piece of fresh-tasting cod (very small), crusted in a spicy coating and served with a small salad and a chutney. I teased the waiter about this not being a \"bento box\" or even a \"box\" but i dug into the flakey moist cod with its crispy, perfectly seasoned crust and was in heaven. It paired perfectly with the green chutney and I could offer no further critique on the presentation after that mouthful. I'm extremely picky with fish and this was as tasty and as far from \"fishy\" as it comes. The mango cheesecake for dessert was divine - with a crunchy brown-sugar butter crust that i could have eaten on it's own. Once again - only complaint: \"I want more!\" The kingfisher beer was an excellent choice with both main and dessert. I've been avoiding this place, thinking the price tag couldn't possibly justify the food, but i was wrong. I will be back here again - probably to purchase an entire mango cheesecake."}
{"text":"Nice food.    I'm not an Indian food expert but I will say I enjoyed their food.   I had organic butter chicken,   quite sweet but tasty.    Then we had dal and another curry chick peas, both tasty.    So on the whole we enjoyed our meal and had great service as well..."}
{"text":"Best Indian restaurant in the city by far! We arrived and were greeting with great Amuse Bouche (pakora) and a non-alcoholic watermelon-mint shot. Both were delicious. The butter chicken here is unbelievable and all of the veggie dishes we tried (baingan bharta, saag paneer, and aloo ghobi) were flavorful and creative. The service is also EXCELLENT. I cannot say enough good things about this place...."}
{"text":"I came here for Summerlicious and I very much enjoyed it. There weren't many people here on a weekend for lunch. The service was good and the food was delicious. I've been here before on a non Summerlicious day for dinner and the lineup was pretty long. They were nice enough to offer us a cocktail which was very generous of them. If this place wasn't so far, I would come here more often!"}
{"text":"The food isn't bad, but you can find comparable or better Indian food for less. Unless you are going there with a groupon, or for Winterlicious, I just don't think the place is worth it. Also, the location is a little out of the way. If you have to travel to get there, I don't think you'll be that satisfied.

People say the prawn dish is da bomb though. So if you go, try that!"}
{"text":"So it wasn't the large copper staple that showed up in a pakora that was the problem.

It was the fact that the owner and waiter were confused about it and then revealed that the pakoras are provided by an external \"supplier\". (And yes they comped the entire meal, but in that \"we are doing this out of obligation\" way, not out of real concern.)

So Amaya is not artisanal Indian food. It is industrial. 

I shall stick to Indian Rice Factory henceforth.

Yay, I said \"henceforth\"."}
{"text":"Dining perfection.

I just had my second meal here (this time during winterlicious) and I can't say enough good things about this place.

I took my girlfriend and parents and as there were 4 selections on the winterlicious menu we all got a different dish and shared them around.  We were able to try their soup, seafood, chicken, lamb, vegetable dishes etc etc. We all agreed that each dish was excellent, perfectly cooked, seasoned and presented and were even suggested an excellent red wine to go along with it.

To top it all off the atmosphere is nice (although it can get a bit noisy when crowded) and the service has been beyond reproach both times I've dined here.

The normal prices here aren't cheap but they are worth from my experience.

This is Indian food at its best as far as I'm concerned."}
{"text":"Was looking so forward to trying out this restaurant - heard so many good things about it.  Went for dinner during Winterlicious and was very, very disappointed...have had much better."}
{"text":"Amaya is our go to place for quality Indian food in an elegant setting.

The prices are higher than a lot of other Indian restaurants, but the quality of ingredients and complexity of flavours would be worth the extra in their own, and when you add the beautiful decor with wood walls and brick red fabric chairs, the prices are reasonable.

Our favourite go to dishes are the Amaya Prawns: juicy jumbo shrimp in a green mango curry sauce with peppers, the flavours are so complex it's difficult to tell what spices are in the sauce but it's so delicious, we order naan to wipe up every last drop of the sauce.

We also ordered pakoras and samosas for the table but the prawns were the hands down winner.

The lamb lollipops are perfectly tender having been marinated before grilled, served with an incredibly tasty mint and fenugreek sauce that is a perfect complement for the lamb.  

Butter chicken is a bit sweet unless you order it spicy but is very tasty with a great creamy sauce to spoon over the basmati rice. 

The Punjabi chicken is the spiciest dish we ordered, but again there is complexity of flavours as well as heat.

Our friends had the Malai Cod, the fish was grilled perfectly and served with a coconut curry sauce, and the Lobster Butter Masala - the lobster was surprisingly sweet and tender in a sauce that I could only describe as a more complex and refined butter chicken sauce for grown ups.  A lot of naan was used to get every last drop of that sauce.

No room for dessert but a few of us had Mango Lassi, a sweet and cooling way to soothe the palate after the spice, which certainly is not overwhelming at Amaya but it builds up all the same.

Anyone who judges Amaya based on their Express locations is missing out on the true gem of the Amaya family, the Indian room on Bayview is at a whole other level in quality and service.

So full, because it's hard to stop eating even when you are full.  Must nap now."}
{"text":"I went to Amaya with a Groupon to try out the place. Let me start with the atmosphere. The owner must have hired a good interior designer who helped decorate the place in a manner that's both authentic, modern and welcoming. Most Indian restaurants in Toronto look cheap and bland, but not Amaya. Bonus points for mellow Indian tunes a-la Buddha Bar.

Service was great 10/10. Our waitress was very attentive and polite.

Food was tasty, with great plate decorations, something you rarely see at Indian restaurants in Toronto. Yes, most items on the menu are priced higher than average and I'm not sure I would go back without a Groupon. However, to be fair, everything was well prepared. Palak Paneer, however, wasn't how I like it. The spinach was like fine paste, which IMHO takes away from the true taste. If you're wondering where one can try a better version of Saag, it would have to be Trimurti - my all-time favourite spot for good Saag/Palak Paneer. Garlic naan was good, but not as good as Trimurti's garlic naan, which is unbeatable.

All in all, Amaya the Indian Room is a great spot for a dinner, but I wouldn't call it the best bang for the buck. Then again, with not much competition in the area and the upscale nature of the venue with a brand name to be upheld, I can see why their items are on average $2-$4 more than at any other Indian restaurant in the city. In the end, I would recommend to go to Amaya yourself and form your own opinion about the place."}
{"text":"Good food, Good ambience, Horrible service, rather expensive.
Waited literally 45 minutes for drinks to come, when we reminded waiter he apologised that he had forgotten, finally got drinks near end of meal. 
Rude staff.
Dirty cutlery, had to ask for a new fork because of baked on food.

Butter chicken was very sweet, but still quite delicious.
The fennel mango lassi has no taste of fennel."}
{"text":"This review for Amaya the Indian Room is based on my Winterlicious 2011 experience.

The Winterlicious lunch ($15) was really good. The service was excellent... just ask my friend who thinks the waiter is nice and nice looking at the same time!

We ended up order different things from the menu so we can tried out different items

Swiss Chard Pakoras 
- Wish it has more chili.. but really tasty and not oily at all...
 
Malai Chicken Tikka 
- taste bland, not enough spice and marinate
- chicken a little dry, but since it is white meat so I am not surprised

Butter Chicken
- Just tasted off.... it tasted kind of sweet
- the dish itself is not hot(spice wise) or hot (temperature wise)
- more like a fusion dish? and it is really small....

Yogi Vegetable Curry
- Mixed vegetables in garlic curry
- This is really well done.. with zucchini, cauliflower, green pepper and eggplant.. 
- Have a nice kick of spiciness and a lot of flavour

Carrot Toffee Pudding with Vanilla Ice Cream
- My friend ordered that but she would not eat it.. saying that the Pudding have strange texture and taste.
- I found it tasted ok.. maybe I just like ice cream in general :)

Chocolate Brownie with Cardamon Scented Rum Sauce
- Chocolate brownie as long as it is chocolaty, I always a fan..
- The Rum sauce has just a little hint of alcohol.. You can barely tasted it...

After having this Winterlicious experience,
- I would recommend Amaya the Indian Room if you want to have a romantic date. The service here is attentive, deco is nice and lighting dim. 
- not recommend if you want to try authentic Indian food, all the spices are toned down and it is really Indian food with a fusion touch

BTW, Amaya is on the pricey side.. I cannot imagine I would pay $17 for even a full order of that  Butter Chicken!"}
{"text":"I have been to Amaya Indian Room (@amayarestaurant) only once a few years ago and recently I have been seeing a lot of their new menu offerings on all of my social media feeds and was so excited when I got invited to a tasting.

Open since 2007, Chef Hemant Bhagwan's Amaya empire came a long way with Amaya Bread Bar, a couple of Amaya Express and food court location across the city plus it's catering business. Plus a line of natural Indian food/sauce called Amaya Gourmet.

We were greeted and served by the man himself and we were told that's we'll be tasting dishes from their Lobsterlicious menu. For $39, you can a 3 course Lobsterlicious prix fixe menu and it's happening until May 18th which you don't want to miss.

Mango Fennel Lassi $3.90
~ Greek yogurt w/ fresh mango pulp & fennel seeds
~ This is perfect for those who can't handle all the spices and heat but for me, thought it was too sweet and thick for me. 
~ Quite filling, especially with all the food we were served. 
~ Should have ordered a lighter and more refreshing drink.

 Crab Lollipop w/ Indian Tartare Sauce Amuse Bouche
 ~ Amuse Bouche usually in bite size, this definitely take quite a few bite. Yes it's a line paper style plate and although it's cute, I am not sure it ties in with the space. 
~ That aside, the plates were rather slippery and presentation is as good as it last to the table.
~ Basically we had 2 dishes that things slip around and ruined the presentation. That aside, this was delicious, very subtle spices in the sauce with crab packed lollipop with minimal fillers.

Gold Medal Scallops
~ spice crusted scallops, cauliflower fritters, roasted lentil & chilli relish
~ Usually not a big fan of scallops but this was so good. 
~ Love all the spices and flavors here plus the added crispiness from the fritters. Strong spices but not overpowering where you can still taste the scallops flavors.

Lobster & Corn Samosa
~ herb chutney
~ Found this a tad salty, it was so flavorful already that the extra salt wasn't needed at all. 
~ The refreshing chutney did save it a bit.


Tandoori Shrimp
~ spicy marinade, chilli & coconut panna cotta
~ Had my fair share of Tandoori chicken but never had shrimp before but it was delicious. 
~ Perfectly cook and flavored plus love the touch of sweetness from the panna cotta foam

Ghee Roast Lamb Tenderloin $12.90
~ wasabi ice cream
~ After mentioning at the beginning that I would love to try something from their regular menu as well and we were offer this dish.
~ Of course we were a tad curious and skeptical about the wasabi ice cream but there was no reason to be since it paired surprisingly well. 
~ The sweetness contrast perfectly with the spices and with a pop of nose numbing wasabi flavor plus the lamb was perfectly cook.

Lobster Makhani with Brandy
~ lobster tika in makhani sauce
~ The sauce was just so amazing, wish it came with a bowl of rice but somehow we still manage to clean the plate.

Roast Lobster 
~ beetroot & curry leaft khichdi, spiced lobster jus
~ This was amazing, the lobster was perfectly roasted & love love love the beetroot khichdi which was incredibly delicious and gave us a break from the stronger / spicier dishes. 
~ Love the sweetness of the beetroot with the grilled lobster and you could decide on how much sauce to take from the side depending on your personal preference. 

Chef's Biryani 
~ biryani is a basmati dish made w/ spices & can include lamb, chicken, seafood & vegetables. Amaya seal their cooking pot with dough & bake it in the oven and it's in limited quantity
~ The dough was broken at the table with steam and smell coming out, you can't help but want to dig in right away. 
~ Love how it was pipping hot and it was a perfect contrast will the cooling cucumber yogurt on the side.

Chilli Olive Naan $4
~ Never had naan with stuffing like that before and it was packed with so much flavors. 
~ They also have flavors like smoked bacon & lamb kulcha and chilli paneer. 
~ Although I really enjoy it, I can't help but think that plain ones will go better with the dishes where you can scoop up the sauces etc.

Blueberry Cardamon Kulfi 
~ liquid nitrogen - prepared table side
~ Had kulfi a few times before but never really enjoyed it but the one here was amazing. 
~ Not only soft and smooth, it had just the right amount of cardamon which can be overwhelming with a heavy hand.
~ I never imagined I'll finish dessert after all the food we had but this was so good that I was wishing for more. 

Verdict:
~ Impress dish after dish, totally amazed by their new menu/direction
~ Great combination of new modern dinning with traditional Indian dishes
~Highly recommended

~ Lobsterlicious is on until May 18th, do not miss it.

*** This meal was complimentary. Opinions are my own***"}
{"text":"Pretty much as good as it gets for Indian food anywhere. 
They call it \"neo-indian cuisine' b/c the chef makes reognizable Indian dishes, but always with something a little bit different than what your used to.
Service was impeccable. 
We found that the Cauliflower starter was probably the best indian dish I have ever tasted, period.  Tandoori green peppercorn chicken tika starter (although large enough to be a main) was also outstanding- I don't know how they do their tandoori that is different than everybody else, but everything that came out of the tandoori was left with that wonderful freshly grilled taste, but always succulent and tender. 
They have a nice tasting menu option - 4 courses for $53 and in the future I will take this so that I can be at the chef's whim."}
