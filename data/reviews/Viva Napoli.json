{"text":"Three and a half?
Fine pizza. Interesting options. I thought it was tasty companion thought it was not as good as they wanted it to be. I'd order again though."}
{"text":"the food - very good. the pizza was awesome and service was good

the drink - i don't drink pop or alcohol so i was limited to water or orange juice. I would have loved iced tea or a lemonade

the atmosphere - crowded but crazy loud. i couldn't communicate with my waiter

best advice - go off main hours. am told it's much more sane"}
{"text":"If you're going to put a sign up saying the open times of your restaurant, consider good business ethics and don't turn people away with 25mins left to go with a remark 'if you can order AND eat in twenty minutes then you're welcome to come in'. How considerate. Won't be venturing here again that much is clear."}
{"text":"Best authentic Neapolitan pizza - my fave is the Margarita.  Ask for the house made hot chilli oil!
Family owned, the staff is always friendly and helpful.
House wine is only $5 a glass with generous pours and the house made soft serve ice cream dessert with fresh fruit is always free.
I quickly became a regular and took all of my friends here.  
Now that I've relocated to Vancouver, I\"m in search of something comparable.  I doubt I will find it.
Viva Napoli truly is one of a kind."}
{"text":"It was a pleasant surprise to see Viva Napoli pop up in this neighbourhood, as I had hoped it would be the end of venturing to the west end to Pizzeria Libretto for my napoletana pizza fix. From the outside, the decor looks very unassuming with its grey walls and wooden tables, and a large \"authentic napoletana pizza\" logo on the window. It looked inviting, but upon dining here, I realized the service would not match the ambiance. 

The service: I'm not sure if they are going for a \"no-fuss\" attitude with their service, but our waiter was not very friendly at all. He greeted us with \"want water?\", took our order by just walking over to us and looking at us with his pen and paper pad, and when we asked which wines by the glass they had, he simply pointed at the menu to a red and a white without explanation of what they were. For the price we were paying for these pizzas ($13-$25), I expected at least a \"hello\" at seating and perhaps the name of the wine I would be ordering. I will say, however, that another gentleman, maybe the manager, did come by and ask us how our meal was, so perhaps we got the grumpy waiter of the bunch. 

The food: The antipasti is not listed on the menu, and you have to ask them what they have for the day, when we went it was a caprese salad, octopus salad, and arugula salad. Nothing really special there. Then the rest of the menu is a selection of around 20 pizzas that range from $13 (margherita pizza) to $25 (some seafood pizza). Most of the pizzas on the menu were $19, which I think is a little steep. There are no other entree selections. I ordered the ortalana (zucchini, eggplants, cherry tomatoes) while my SO ordered the prosciutto and arugula one. Both were very tasty, and in your typical napoletana-style fashion, was so thin it had to be eaten with a fork and knife. The crust was a mix between chewy and crispy, which I love. They certainly did not skimp on the toppings, as my SO's pizza was filled with prosciutto. Yum!

Overall, I have not decided whether I will return. The poor service and bad wine was made up for by the great pizza, but I don't think I should be compromising either when I'm paying $19 for a pizza. I'll wait until they're a little more developed. Hopefully their service and menu selection will improve.

3.5/5 stars"}
{"text":"If you have a craving for an authentic Neapolitan style pizza, then you have found the right place.  This wonderful little gem located in the heart of Mount Pleasant village caters to pizza lovers who enjoy and understand what quality pizza should taste like.  I have tried numerous varieties at this location, and have never been disappointed.  The service is incredible and the ambiance is absolutely perfect!  Looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Pizza was good, service was terrible. Still looking for best Italian Pizza in the city."}
{"text":"The best pizza I've ever had. The restaurant is small and seemed very family oriented. They have a huge selection of pizzas and the crust was absolutely perfect! I find sometimes with Neapolitan pizza, the dough can get soggy, but that wasn't the case here. Salads were great too - simple arugula and caprese salads. Wine situation was also interesting - they only have 1 red and 1 white, but for $5/glass, I'm not complaining! They also serve free ice cream for dessert, but after all that pizza, I'm not sure who still has room for ice cream. All in all, I'm a fan and will be back!  

My only criticism - The owner was very helpful, but maybe needs to trust his staff a bit more - we ordered with someone else and then he came over and yelled out the order again, when in fact they were already preparing it. I understand it's his restaurant, but it just seems counter productive and can become confusing for his staff...

Also, one of the stalls in the women's washroom seems to be missing a door and the lock does not work in the other stall... very odd. Maybe they can fix that?"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch over the weekend.

Nice large space with plenty of seating. Was greeted as soon as we walked in.

Service was exceptional!

We order the margherita pizza. It came out quick and was exactly what you would hope! The tomato sauce was incredible! All in all I would give this place 5/5.

Definitely going back :)

Thank you!"}
{"text":"Delicious. A must go if you're a fan of good food, pizza and lively dining. 

So many options. So many tastes. Kid friendly. I would call ahead for a reservation if you don't want to be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great service every time we go. Classic, thin crust pizza just like what you get in Naples."}
{"text":"I can no longer enjoy any other pizza in Toronto after having eating pizza here. The pizzas are so delicious, there are so many varieties to choose from (including a menu with pictures), an amazing hot chili sauce if you want, plus they often provide a free dessert. The crust is amazing, I just can't leave a piece behind!"}
{"text":"Best tuna pizza in the city. First time I mentioned that tuna pizza is my favourite, people in Canada looked at as if I went crazy and I tried to explain that it is actually a very typical Italian pizza. So happy that Viva Napoli has proven me right with this divine goodness."}
{"text":"Probably the best pizza i have never had. Nice house wine for $5. I thought it was a little bit pricey for pizza(mine was $25) but trust me its worth it! Dessert was on the house(ice cream with fruit toppings)and it was great as well. Definitely my favourite pizza place from now on!"}
{"text":"1. We called and told Viva Napoli that we were going to be late for our 7PM reservations, only to be told that they aren't open until 7:30PM because of renovations. If that's going to happen, please have the courtesy to call the people who made reservations ahead of time to let them know. We had the courtesy to call you we were going to be late. You should be doing that in general. 

2. When we got there, the server just showed us in the general direction of where we are sitting. We weren't guided there. It made me think if this place was new because it seemed the kinks weren't ironed out (they are no longer new!). This pizza joint is lacking warmth and charisma.

3. I had to ask for olive oil, chili flakes, and chili oil. I felt bad to even ask for salt and pepper, so I didn't.The salt and pepper should be at the table. 

4. I wanted to put away my own food (I don't like other people handling my food.) and I told the lady I would do it myself. She huffily picked up my pizzas and didn't wash her hands before handling it. If someone insists, please let it go and give the customer your pizza box. I will be cooking away her germs for lunch today.

5. Pizza was soggy. It wasn't hot either."}
{"text":"Love this place. Been there twice based on a friend's recommendation and it hasn't disappointed. The first time I did take-out. The pizza was great but the service horrible. I asked them to bring the pizza after a certain time as I wasn't going to be home. Also, I asked to change the ingredients on one of the pizzas. Not only did the pizza arrive 20 minutes early, one of the pizzas also didn't have the change I had requested for! By the time I got there, the pizza was cold and I had to warm it up. I even called them to let them know, and they didn't seem to really care. If they had a sense of customer service, they would've at least tried to make amends one way or another.

The second time I had a sit-down. Good service, great food. Both times I took the Viva Napoli, and I'm afraid the next time, I'll take Viva Napoli as well because it's so delicious."}
{"text":"Outstanding Neopolitan pizza!  So much to choose from!  A real neighbourhood find!  Definitely try the antipasti Eggplant Parmesan, you will be trying to lick the plate when you get to the end.  As for the pizza, there is very little say other than bravissimo!!! Quite simply the best Neopolitan outside of Naples itself, thirty four different pizzas to choose from, you would have to come once every week for over 8 months to make your way through them all - every one a tasty gem!  Alesia, our waitress was outstanding, gave us a wonderful \"homemade\" ice cream for dessert (gratis) that finished off the meal beautifully!  What a treat.  Dine-in with charming quiet atmosphere; or the incredible take-out deal of 4 of their more modest pizzas for only $40!!!!!   Hard to choose!!  What a great local place for our South Eglington & Mt. Pleasant area!"}
{"text":"Wonderful, authentic pizza!  We like it more than Libretto."}
{"text":"If you just consider quality of pizza, it's a contender in the city.  However there were some aberrations which make me unlikely to return.

First, almost half of their pizzas were crossed off of their menu due to seasonal restrictions, which is the strangest way to have a seasonal menu.  

Once we did decide, we sat there for 20 minutes trying to get the attention of anyone to take our order.

But my real beef with Viva Napoli was that I ordered the \"Porcini\" pizza.  I was surprised it was not crossed off like the other seasonal items, but that's not for me to worry about.  What I was served was a pizza with just button mushrooms on it.  I asked why there was no porcini and the waiter said it's because, of course, porcinis are out of season.   Well, you think you should have mentioned that when I ordered???  To add insult to injury, he charged me full price, $19, for a plain pizza with button mushrooms."}
{"text":"Extremely overpriced pizza for less than fresh ingrediants. They put canned pineapple on my pizza that looked vile. Homemade ice cream at the end was a fun idea, but I was still - overall - not impressed with Viva Napoli."}
{"text":"Fresh, quality ingredients and amazing service. The best is the complimentary, home made ice cream!"}
{"text":"So got to the restaurant around 10:17pm shows on here that they close at 11pm...i walk in and say could i get a pizza to go...the guy says politely sorry we are closed...i say it says you are open till 11pm...oh when its slow we close early...ok i practically got walked out of the restaurant and even after i mentioned i drove  all the way from Mississauga...def customer service fail and false information about the hours ...And its Friday very disappointed"}
{"text":"This has got to be my most \"on the fence\" experiences ever! The food tasted great! Very unique, fresh and delicious. The customer service was great too. The waiting staff and the owner were really friendly. We did wait for about 10 mins for a table but we didnt mind. We ordered and the food arrived relatively quickly. But as soon as the pizza arrived, i was disappointed. There was barely enough topping, which was too bad coz it tasted so great. For the most part i felt like i was eating a whole bunch of plain bread. Skimping on quantity is not an ethical business practice imo especially when the customer is made to pay exorbitant amounts of money for the food. And the free ice cream on the house... Again it was the same story.. Tastedd great but It was about half a scoop in a large speckled cup. And its likely that the price of the pizzas here covers the 'free' treat and a whole lot more. If they fixed the quantities, i would consider going back and also recommend it to others too. But as it stands now.. It's a half baked experience!"}
{"text":"Went there with my S.O. on a Sat. night recently.  Place was jam packed...a good sign fo the owner.
The Greeting:  a very friendly and prompt welcome was offered with a place offered right at the counter in front of the pizza makers...a great view and much quieter than being in the middle of this restaurant which has a high but not unbearable noise factor when busy.
The service:  Our server was new according to her, but we received our menus promptly and shortly after our drink order was taken then our food order.  So far..so good.
Drinks were delivered quickly and then we waited...and waited...and waited for 50 minutes until the pizza arrived.  I really don't care how good your pizza is....that's an awfully long time to wait for your meal.  The problem is: pizza is the main event for this resto other than some salad offerings, so wouldn't you know it....everybody who comes here wants PIZZA!  But, they only have 1 pizza oven and when you have to serve 25 tables at once, you have a pizza production bottleneck....Mamma mia!
The food:  pizzas were authentically Neapolitan style...yes, I've been to Napoli so I know.  Good chewy crust, baked just right.  

Conclusion?  Go here if you want real Napoli style pizza but eat something before you arrive if you're only going to order pizza, cuz if it's crowded, expect to wait a long time for your delicious pizza.
BTW - if you're into stuff like whole wheat or multigrain crusts  - fuhgettaboutit!  This is not what they do in Napoli so don't even ask."}
{"text":"I have been to other Neapolitan pizzeria's in Toronto and was so excited to find this one in my neighbourhood.   

Best pizza in Toronto hands down!"}
{"text":"I've been impressed with the quality of the pizza in Toronto lately. This place was recommended to me by my lady friend who's brother in law is from Napoli and swears by this place. So naturally I had to try it. Being Italian myself and just coming back from Italy a few months back, I know my pizzas very well. This place makes an authentic Neapolitan style pizza. I've read other reviews on this place and people didn't seem to like how it's very thin and undercooked in the centre. But anyone who's had an authentic Neapolitan pizza knows that's just how it is. Maybe you're not a Neapolitan style pizza kinda person, which is fine but this pizza is very authentic and I will definitely make it back here soon. I give it only 4 because we would've liked a bigger drink selection. But food wise, spot on"}
{"text":"I have tried this place twice with hopes of finding a regular spot to go for authentic pizza. Well, after a second time, we're done. And for several reasons. But one stands out more than others. 

I appreciate an effort to be warm and genuine to your customers. In fact, it's often what brings me back time again. But at this place, unfortunately, friendliness is veiled with an agenda. Owner: \"Oh, no need to wait for a better table. The ones by the bar are the best seats in the house\" Hmmmm? You mean the section that's empty, cramped and right beside the kitchen? You know, the one that wouldn't allow my wife and I to even look at each other during our meal? Yes. We'll pass.

Fine. We're not that precious. But yet again, as we prepared to leave, the same insincere \"friendliness\" reared its head in an attempt to upsell - after we had dropped a significant chinch of change on drinks and remarkably overpriced, average pizza. 
Owner: \" How was the meal\" You know what would make it even better? One of our desserts!\" Tip. Stop while you're ahead. A question about our experience is thoughtful,considerate and generally good business practice. BUT, the second you try to squeeze another $10 out of us as we try to leave, the gesture is lost.

This could be a good little neighbourhood spot. It's cozy, charming and the food is ok - mind you the prices need to be adjusted. But at the end of the day, I know tons of places that are genuine because they simply appreciate my business, not because they want to maximize space and move more product. For a place that claims to be genuine experience, we've found, after two visits, it's anything but."}
{"text":"I was all excited to order pizza from Viva Napoli, I was visiting from NYC where I live near some great Naples style pizzerias.  I ordered two pies, a margarita with sausage and one with mushrooms.

I arrive to pick up and was shocked when told I owed $42 dollars for two small individual pies!!!  Now I'm used to NYC prices but $42 for two small pies?  I provided my credit card and was told \"sorry no credit cards\". What!!
 
Finally, I arrive home expecting a great $21 individual custom made pizza, but no, it was so soggy when I picked it up, it flopped over an the little bit of topping fell on the floor.  I admit the basic ingredients were there, but it was not cooked well!

Overall it was a overprice, soggy pie that even a cold beer or glass of fine wine could not compensate for.  And CASH only?

Next visit I don't thing it will still be there!"}
{"text":"I am glad that we finally have real pizza place in the neighbourhood!
First things first: the pizza is awesome! Thin, charred crust, phenomenal tomato sauce, real cheese, are some things to rave about.
The place is small and reminiscent of many Italian restaurants that we have actually visited in Italy: sparsely decorated white walls with scenes from old Italian movies ( Toto?)
 They also have nice apps which are advertised on the black board near the door. We have tried octopus salad (very good), and eggplant parmigiana (very, very good!). 2 of my favourite pizzas are capricciosa and pizza with fresh mozzarella cheese and mushrooms - simply spectacular.
If you like real Italian pizza this place is a must!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here for some authentic pizza, but I feel like the word authentic is just another way to rip customers off. This place is extremely overpriced for the super thin pizza with minimal toppings. Each pizza is smaller than a dinner plate and is between 20 and 30 dollars for basic sauce, cheese and maybe one sparsely sprinkled topping on the pizza. The sauce is watery and kind of gross as it falls everywhere and soaks the thin dough. Maybe I don't understand the authentic Italian experience but compared to the competitors that serve pizza in Toronto this place has very low value for what you receive, honestly order your favourite delivery and save yourself the trip. No wonder we changed how we do pizza if this is the authentic crap they serve In Napoli"}
{"text":"Probably the worst $20 pizza I have ever had. Undercooked, over cheesed, and sloppy greasy liquid toppings. Service subpar. The one bright spot was the woodsy flavor of the under fired crust."}
{"text":"Truly the best Neapolitan pizza in Toronto! I had the classic margarita pizza and my husband had the Vincenzo - both incredible. Perroni and prosecco were also top notch. Will be back over and over again!"}
{"text":"I've only known this place for two weeks but have already been here three times. Best pizza in Toronto, hands down! The dough is absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"Amazing. Every. Time. 

My boyfriend and I have been to Viva Napoli numerous times. It is by far our favourite pizza place in the city.  Their crust is thin and chewy and mouth-wateringly delicious. 

The owner is always there and more than happy to share his passion for authentic Neapolitan pizza, from his trips to Italy, to explaining how the crust is thin and chewy rather than crispy.  The first time we went here, the owner was our server and he insisted we have the margarita pizza to taste what true Neapolitan pizza is meant to taste like, with no extra bells and whistles.  Now it is the bench mark that I use to judge other pizza places. Nothing has even come close to the experience at Viva Napoli. We will be back again and again and again."}
{"text":"We've been on the hunt for TO's best Neapolitan pizza.  So far, Viva Napoli wins the title.  Unlike Pizza Libretto and Queen Margarita, the pizza at Viva Napoli has more character and flavour.  The crust is extremely soft and delicate, but it's not soggy like the neapolitan pizzas at these other places.  The toppings are exceptional and the combinations work together extremely well.  

The place also has exceptional service.  The room is quiet enough for easy conversation.  The setting is excellent - including really great glassware and cutlery.  But really, it's about the pizza.  Great, great pizza!"}
{"text":"I'm giving a sold 4 stars for the great Hawaiian pizza that I ate and the creamy ice cream that was on the house. Great place for a quiet (although not completely silent) Friday night. They also conveniently have a photo of every pizza they have. So that helps."}
{"text":"Don't understand the rave reviews and hype for this place.... We each ordered a pizza and they were disgustingly soggy and falling apart. The service was nothing memorable. I regret not thinking to complain at the time. Looks like other people have had similar situations and got very soggy pizza according to other reviews. You're better off going to another better place like Fabbrica or Pizza Libretto."}
{"text":"I've been waiting to try this place for a while. We had heard that their pizzas are supposed to be up there with the best. We arrived when it was quite busy and had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated even though there were open tables - service is very slow! House wine is only $5 for a healthy glass - great! The pizzas are around $22-$25 and so you'd expect high quality. I tried the Capriciossa and it was perfect apart from the fact they used canned mushrooms - WTF!?! The canned mushrooms kinda ruined what was a good pizza. I don't think I'll be paying those prices again for canned ingredients and slow service. Sorry..."}
{"text":"I was staying at a hotel on Mt. Pleasant, and wanted to find a restaurant for dinner, so I just started walking.  As I approached Viva Napoli, there was a very friendly girl outside chatting with passers-by and showing the restaurant's menu.  The menu has pizza, and that's pretty much it, but it was REALLY good pizza.  I tried one with ham, olives, artichokes, basil and cheese, and it was delicious.  Very crispy, bubbly crust with lots of gooey goodness in the middle of the pizza.  I could only eat half of the pizza, but the server was more than happy to box up the rest for me to take home.  My service was quick but not rushed, though others seemed to be waiting quite some time for their bills, credit cards in hand.  Not sure what the issue was there, but I enjoyed Viva Napoli and would recommend it."}
{"text":"The restaurant is a little out of the way but I was in the area and had read some good reviews on this place so I tried it. I think a lot of people don't realize it's a Neapolitan pizza joint so they aren't going to get the thick crust of \"traditional\" pizza, but I found that it was absolutely amazing and so full of flavour, and also baked perfectly. I would definitely return to this place with no hesitation. Check it out with take-out or delivery as well."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my first experience at Viva Napoli and trying Naples style wood-fired pizza.  The experience was really nice from start to finish.  

We were informed what to expect regarding Naples style pizza and that the traditional texture  of the pizza dough is going to be soft and would seem undercooked but it's not.  After some research, I can confirm that this is the case.  Only because all the other wood-fired pizza places have crispier crusts. :-)

The pizzas are made for one but the real fun is everyone ordering a different combination and then mixing and matching at the table so you can get a taste of everything.

They have a lot of choice at Viva Napoli and it could seem to draw you into a bit of choice paralysis but rest assured that you can't go wrong with whatever you choose.  

We started with a eggplant parm appetizer that was We went with the four different pizzas and I only remember that we ordered the salsicca & funghi as well as the bacon & egg style.

All four pizzas were delectable with a knife and fork due to the aforementioned Naples style crust.  The free dessert at the end was a nice finish to the meal as well. :-)

I find the price a little on the high side for wood-fire pizza so i would find it hard to come back on a semi-regular basis but I think this place is worth the effort though once in a good while."}
{"text":"We were craving for some authentic pizza on Friday night and went to Viva Napoli after reading reviews on YELP.  

Arrived at around 8 and we got seated quickly and greeted by our waiter at our table.  The place is simple, staff are all really friendly and for some reason, it reminded me of La Vecchia on Yonge / Eglinton.  

Ordered 2 pizzas and eggplant lasagna (appetizer) .  tomato sauce and cheese were both excellent, Pizza i find a little bit on the soft side but it was tasty.  The portions were bigger than we though so we had 1/2 pizza left to go !  Man... the pizza taste even better then next day! 

The dinner came to $70 with tips and taxes. We also order a glass of wine and espresso at the end.  

PS.  They offer take out as well and these pizzas make really good \"next day\" lunches!  

PS2.  They got really busy when we left (around 9) so get there early to beat the crowd.

PS3.  If you like Grazie on Yonge / Egl, you will not like Viva napoli"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza. Crust is soft & chewy. I would say this is one of the best pizzas I've had in Toronto. 
Casual atmosphere. Cheap wines (taste comparable to price- I would not order their house red again- it wasn't very good).
I would certainly order pizza for take-out from here again, but doubt I'd eat in again. It is busy, very casual & I'd prefer to enjoy their pizzas at home."}
{"text":"Back to 5 stars for me! I've been several times since my poor experience and it really is almost a perfect pizza dining experience. Margherita is the best in the city. Wine list is small but excellent. Antipasti is again a small list but fantastic. Aside from the atmosphere being a little bright and some garish decor, this is one of my favourite neighbourhood spots!"}
{"text":"The best most authentic pizza in Toronto. I loved in Italy for a few years and coming back I've been yearning for something authentic, and this place is the closest I've had so far.  Fresh and good quality ingredients. The tomato sauce was fresh, wonderful mozzarella cheese and lots of aromatic basil (I had the Margherita). Definitely my favourite pizza place in my neighbourhood."}
{"text":"The best pizza in Canada 
Who says negative things is just hater or ignorant about food and deserve mcndonalds."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited Viva Napoli about two weeks ago.  We hadn't been here for about a year, but always thought the pizza was decent.  It was cold out, and we wanted something close by and reliable, so I made an 8pm reservation, and off we went.

First thing: we get to the restaurant, and there is no one there to greet us.  Okay, no problem.  They looked busy, so we waited.  Patiently.  For no less than TEN minutes for someone to even acknowledge our presence.  Please be reminded we had a reservation.  It was then that a couple walked through the restaurant's front door, proceeded to bypass us, gave a friendly kiss on the cheek to one of the waitresses, and proceeded to take the table we had been waiting for!  

Strike One.

After complaining to the host, he gave a half-hearted apology and led us to a table sandwiched between two others.  You all know what kind of table I'm referring to: one that is so very close in proximity to others that you can practically smell the other diners' breath.  One woman at one of the aforementioned tables was so annoyed when I had to ask her to push her chair in so I could pass that she picked up her coat and slammed it on the ground.  

Strike Two.

It was then my husband and I decided halfway decent pizza was no compensation for the shabby way we were treated.  We got up to leave, and the manager came over.  Instead of inquiring what the problem was, she basically told us to have a good evening, and left it at that.

When we got back to our car, we were so annoyed and upset about what had just transpired, we called the restaurant, and spoke to said manager.  After giving her the down-low on the events that had happened at her restaurant, her response was utter nonsense.  She alternately repeated \"I'm sorry about what happened-- I'm the manager\" (yes, we figured you were after we asked to speak to \"the manager\") and (I'm not making this up) \"I believe the couple that was rude to you had mental problems\" about six times.  Mental problems?!?!  It sounds absurd even as I type this.

Strike Three.

There was no mention of compensation of any sort, not even what seemed like any sort of real apology for how we'd been treated.  While I understand she may not be able to control how her patrons act, she sure as heck should be able to control her employees.

I hope my review saves some people from wasting their time, money and expectations at this restaurant.  I will stick to the always wonderful Pizzeria Libretto."}
{"text":"Not going to lie, when first entered this little hidden Gem, I thought this should be interesting, as most of the staff didn't speak very good English. That being said, the experience I received was 100% Italian cuisine ( or in this case, pizza pie) absolutely the best most flavorful wood fired Napoli pizza I have ever eaten!! That was 6 years ago, they were fairly new then. And have yet to have a fire oven pizza that has come even remotely close to the quality and flavor from this place"}
{"text":"I came here last night for dinner and what a wonderful experience. I arrived shortly after 7pm and it was packed! After a few times telling me I would be seated, the owner/manager came over and sat me. The tables are large enough to actually fit 2 people (have you seen those 2 people tables which are so small they are only good for 1? well, not here!).  Since I was dining alone, he returned shortly with a Naples coffee table book to enjoy while I waited. Wow, I felt pretty darn special!

I ordered the margharita pizza and it was delicious. I love herbs and would have been happy with a few more fresh basil leaves.  I liked that the tomatoes and cheese melting were not leaving a greasy residue. 

I am so happy I came here to have a delicious dinner. Will be returning for sure!"}
{"text":"Thin crust and overall great dough. 

I heard about this place from a coworker, before I even moved in the area. 

The servers were friendly, though our service was delayed. Some time after we got in, another couple was seated and their orders were taken before us. The pizza came later, meaning even the guy who took our order literally asked, \"Did your pizza come in yet?\"  I guess at the time we waited, it was as if we could have finished our plates already. It wasn't that packed but the service itself was meh. No one came to ask if we're ok. In fact, our emptied glass weren't refilled, even though it seemed like we've been passed by a few times. It's not really the biggest deal, but we felt pretty ignored. 

The food itself, it's pretty pricey. I got the Magherita and got one basil leaf on it. One! Unless that's how it's supposed to be, then I guess that's that. 

I liked the thin crust and the dough of the pizza. My pizza was ok to me, while my friend really enjoyed what was apparently the most popular choice. I forgot what it was called, but just ask for the recommended pizza. 

They have an in house hot sauce, boy that was hot! They suggest you put just a little bit and work from there. I'm talking about start with one tiny drop. That was a wise tip. 

We also enjoyed the complimentary ice twist served to everyone in the end. 

Overall, this place is worth a try."}
{"text":"I was curious about this place as it has allot of hype about their pizza but flack about their service. My wife and I ate there in Feb of 2012 and we loved the pizza and felt the service was good. The owner made sure the tables were happy with their food, so pride definitely goes into each pizza. We will be heading there any time we feel like a pizza night. There is also a local theatre 2 doors down so this would be great for a date night ;)"}
{"text":"I just came from Viva Napoli, sampling a pizza there for the first time. The menu is extensive, with lots of choices, and descriptions and photos to further help people make up their minds. The owner was at the take-out counter today. He was generous with his time and information, patiently answering all my questions. Since I was not planning to dine in, he was mindful to suggest a pizza that would 'travel well.'  He explained that arugula and raw prosciutto wilt when not eaten straight out of the oven. He therefore suggested that, if I had a craving for prosciutto, I should go with the Fume pizza because the prosciutto is cooked first, and will therefore travel better. Great advice, and it was an amazing pizza! Take-out is cheaper than eat in and includes a drink. I strongly recommend Viva Napoli for anyone looking for authentic Italian pizza."}
{"text":"A word to those who've never had \"authentic Napoli style pizza,\" be forewarned, this style of pizza is sparsely topped, thin and very basic in flavour. The photos don't joke. That big red background is all the tomato sauce and those white polka dots are the sum total of the cheese you get. 

I don't doubt how authentic this is, but at $18 a pizza, it is authentically cheap on toppings.  About two inches of the dough had only tomato sauce, there was maybe two basil leaves on the whole pizza and a few globs of  \"fior de latte,\" - a mozzarella with a texture more like a mix between sour cream and ricotta. 

Admittedly, the crust and sauce were tasty, but our capriccioso had grocery store quality sliced deli ham, canned olives, canned artichoke and a few mushrooms.
  
We wanted to try the Fume, but $21 seemed way too steep for the negligent amount of toppings.

I'd go here again - but only if someone else was grabbing the tab. ;)"}
{"text":"Hands down the best wood fired pizza in Toronto... and trust me - I've tried a lot! It's so good it literally brings tears to my eyes... I can't believe how delicious it is! The taste cannot even compare to any other pizza joint I've been too. Totally worth every dollar. I'm vegetarian, so I love that they have so many veg options. I always get the Parmigiana with the eggplant and tomato sauce base - it's too good to try anything else lol! My boyfriend loves the Diavola and gets that one every time - I recommend this if you're into sausage. Definitely a must-try, but be careful, you may get hooked!!!"}
{"text":"I was incredibly disappointed with the customer service at this restaurant. We called on a Friday night to order take out and we were given to another person to take our order. I guess they forgot about us because the phone hung up. We called again and the staff was incredibly rude stating they were really busy and the pizza was going to take a long time - basically discouraging us from ordering. How dare we inconvenience this place but trying to give them our money? 

We tried again the next night and successfully ordered the panna, prosciutto and fungi. It was pretty good but the prices are expensive and the customer service ruined our entire experience. Wouldn't return again."}
{"text":"This place is miles ahead of the rest.  My favourite pizzeria in Toronto.  I've been here four times and it's consistent, and leaves you looking forward to your next visit.  Super Yum!  Try the Ortalana, Funghi Misti, Parmigana, Capricciosa or you know what, try them all.  :)"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place while on a walk on the area, and I am glad we did. The pizza was delicious enough that I would have eaten the dough plain. It was very authentically Neapolitan, as advertised. Service was great, as well. They even brought us a bit of ice cream for dessert on the house, and that was delicious too! I will definitely be back whenever I am in this neighbourhood again."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and quick service, and delicious food! 
They also had a cute special that offered a free drink with each pizza because they had a chef in training making the pizzas."}
{"text":"$11 for the most basic SOGGY pizza! Single topping of tomato sauce with 2 pieces of garlic! Shameful spot. Waste of your money. Avoid. $11 for only a tomato sauce topping on the crust  is equivalent to theft! SOGGY Pizza. Avoid, avoid, avoid."}
{"text":"I went there last week with my best friend. It's a good place overall! The place was clean and didn't feel overly crowded even though the place isn't big. They used interesting \"sauna\" wood in the bathroom. 

Looking at older reviews, if there were issues with the service before, I feel like they're making a concerted effort to change it. I had two servers. Both were friendly and polite. Service is not slow. They were not all that observant, as they passed us several times and we needed to ask for water again but that's only a small thing. Also the chili sauce they make is very good! 

I ordered the proscuitto and arugala pizza. It was fresh, thin crust, and tasted great! A definite hearty serving. Also $5 house wine. They offered free vanilla ice cream at the end, and it was very creamy and delicious."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  
I'm a sucker for a good slice of pizza so when I walked by, I knew I had to try it! 

VIBE 
If \"exposed brick\" means slabs of cement as a wall, then you've got some great atmosphere. I'm guessing that they were going for the rustic atmosphere and it feels that way but I also feel like it's half done. 

I recommend going at lunch during the week because it's not as crowded. 
We were served immediately and our servers were nice and friendly. 

WE ATE 
If you're extremely hungry, split two pizzas between two people. We got their most popular za's: The Capricossa and the classic Margharita. 

The Capricossa was topped with DOP tomatoes, fior di latte mozzarella, cooked ham, sauteed mushrooms, olives, artichoke and basil. This pizza really hit the spot! The flavours of the ingredients really worked well together and having artichoke was a nice treat. The crust was fantastic. In comparison with Libretto, it's not as doughy and burnt.; it's a bit of a thinner crust and a smaller portion. This means more pizza, which I like.  I wish they were as generous with the olives as they were with the mushrooms. 

The Margharita missed the mark for me. There were two small pieces of basil on the pizza, so I just felt like it wasn't very good value or had a lot of good flavour. We used the chilli sauce to make up for it and gat damn...it was SPICY! 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
Not quite like pizza in Naples. But the Capricossa hits the spot. I like that this Italian spot gives the Mount Pleasant nabe a bit of variety. Bada Boom. Bada Bing (oh wait, that's East Side Marios!)."}
{"text":"Perfect real Italian pizza the way they do it in Naples. Spent 5 weeks in Italy eating lots of pizza and this is absolutely on par with how it's done there.  The dough is soft and not crispy, a similar texture to naan. Pizza comes thin and has very fresh ingredients. This is one of my favourite places to eat in Toronto. 

Don't expect anything like what you'd get from a chain restaurant. If you like your pizza thick, salty and greasy stick to Pizza Hut.  If you want true Italian style pizza, Viva Napoli is for you."}
{"text":"I could eat at this place every day and never get tired of it. Which pie to start with? DOP or white, top off with a salad and some house wine. And finish it all off with some of their soft serve Gelato, awesome! 
Always super friendly too."}
{"text":"Viva Napoli does the best Neapolitan pizza in Toronto. period. No comparison to Libretto or Terroni, which have become too trendy. Sure, on a busy night, you have to wait a while, but it's worth the wait and the service isn't that bad. If authenticity and good pizza is what you're after (and really isn't that the point of eating, not picking on service?), then skip the imitators and go here."}
{"text":"If this review were based on taste alone, I'd give this place 5 stars. But, it's not. 3.5 stars is about fair really, and here is why:

Value: worst value I have had in a while. A simple margerita pizza sets you back $14, and feeds one hungry person, or two people not looking to eat a meal. If you want beyond that, say with three pieces of prosciutto, expect to pay $5, and anything else, up to $22. That means you pay $8 for four toppings, and it feeds, at most, 1 person as a meal.

Second point: they take only cash. Cash only. Pretty astonishing stuff for a restaurant in the 21st century.

Finally, in certain spots, you will be blinded by the sun. No drapes at all. And no warning, concern, or consideration from the staff. They'll sit you in the sun, and from there on in, you're going to have a crappy time. Also, they won't check up on you or refill waters or ask if you want another drink. They'll bring you pizza and a drink, and that's about it for service

Hence, 3 stars. Great food, other stuff less than good."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the Yonge & Eg area. Traditional (and certified) Neapolitan style pizza ... Absolutely delicious.

The Margherita, Alessia and Crudaiola are my absolute favourites. My boyfriend loves the Prosciutto Arugula Pizza. Chilli oil is uber HOT but fantastic. The red (a Primitivo) is cheap and cheerful ... We actually started buying it from the LCBO as our personal \"house red\" at home. The sparking red is awesome, very unique and definitely worth a try. The staff are great and always remember us. Sometimes dessert is on the house (strawberries and homemade ice cream), which is a nice treat!

Things that could be improved - decor is lacking warmth, they recently started accepting cash as the only payment (which I think is a bit tacky) and prices are MUCH higher than other Neapolitan joints in the city (Libretto, Queen Margherita, etc).

That said, when we lived in the area, we'd go to Napoli a couple times a month. Awesome pizza ... You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This was the best pizza we've ever had! The owner explained napoleon pizza to us and it was delicious. Such a nice atmosphere and great service. So many different options for pizza- something for everyone.  Great tasting wine at a great value too! And to top it off the best tasting ice cream (complementary at that). We will definitely be back! Nom nom nom."}
{"text":"Great pizza spot in Davisville. Always full of people, fresh pizza and a spicy pepper dip to go with the pizzas. Oh and free ice cream!"}
{"text":"Sunday afternoon linner and a pizza craving. Neither of us were particularly hungry, so we decided to just get one Margherita pizza, an arugula salad, and the peperonata appetizer, which came in just over $40. The salad was slightly under-dressed for my taste, and the peppers could have been warmed up, but both were very tasty. They were also a little on the small side for the price. 

The pizza, though, as simple as it was, was delicious. The crust had just the right amount of crunch, the cheese was perfectly gooey, and the tomato sauce tasted very fresh. The chili oil is SUPER spicy (YUM!), so use sparingly! I only used it on one slice so that I could taste the individual flavours of the true ingredients on the others. At the end of the meal, they offered us an ice cream on the house - a very nice gesture - and SO creamy and flavorful, even for simple vanilla with a strawberry on top. 

Someone recently mentioned in another review that they do not accept credit cards, but this was not the case for us: the waitress told us they take everything but AMEX."}
