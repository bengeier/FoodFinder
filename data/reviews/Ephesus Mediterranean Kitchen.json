{"text":"Absolutely amazing....
The lamb kabob pizza was awesome, the wings were good,perfectly cooked, and there was no beating the homemade hummas.
This is a place i will frequent, unique and tasty..."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza crust in Pittsburgh - and yes, I remember when Vincent's Pizza Park was king.

I don't know what else to say - I usually rank dough third after cheese and sauce - but this is literally the first time in my entire life that I'd rather eat the crust than anything else.

I haven't ordered the Turkish stuff yet, but I assume it's amazing - the Traditional pies are to die for. 

The crust is best compared to Indian naan - buttery and fluffy, just enough yeastiness and salt, crunchy with a hint of oil and toasted cheese on the outside, and puffy with fluff on the inside.  This crust is clearly made by hand by a bread ninja.

Although you can order 'em, I'm  NOT reviewing an \"ethnic\" pizza - this is a genuine real-deal American pie.  100% best crust in the city, hands down.

*VERY* highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great range of foods. Everyone loved what they had. I had the pide (pe-day) with egg and cheese. It was pure comfort food and larger than I expected, but really tasty and definitely hit the spot. 

I was with a crowd of friends. One of whom ordered the lamb kebab and everyone raved about it (not a meat eater, so taking their word for it). Their babaganoush was excellent. Serving sizes are generous, but ambience leaves a bit to be desired. If possible, consider take out."}
{"text":"These Turkish guys can cook!!! Everything is always good. Great delivery! Fair pricing, but usually when paying with a debit card they call back and have to ask for the number again... it's a language barrier thing.. 
It's the only pizza store we order from!! Highly Recommended!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery. We had ordered a salad with extra dressing, we were charged for the extra dressing but received NO dressing at all. Not a big deal, but when we called to let them know, hey fought with us saying it's in the bag when there was none whatsoever. They said they would deliver the rest of our order...we live right across the river from them too so they're close by...they never showed up. This isn't the first time we had issues with their subpar food and service. Just make sure your order is all there before the delivery driver takes off because they won't go out of their way to make it right for their customers."}
{"text":"I wanted to try a new place and ordered a pizza on 6/27 and when it arrived the driver took the pizza out of his trunk and the cheese (not surprisingly) had slid entirely off the whole pizza into a corner of the pizza box.  I showed it to the driver, and he told me to call it in for a new one.  I called them... they had nothing to say, promised to send a new pizza and it never came.  Unacceptable.  I'll be choosing another place next time."}
{"text":"I found this place downtown and now one closer to home. Good quality and nice people!"}
{"text":"I suggested to nobody go to this restaurant , the delivery guy say bad words to me because he said he can't come upstairs because he is busy"}
{"text":"1- These guys are the best pizza I have found so far.  Unique, fresh, yummy and their sauce is pretty darn good.  I love white pizzas too.

2- Delivery can be a hit or miss: To 15222 it is great!  To 15203 it is iffy."}
{"text":"Update: after having tried Ephesus a couple more times, I have to say that I am a fan, and it's now my go-to spot for pizza. Their pies are pretty good, but what really won me over was their wings (they're called \"wing dings\" on the menu). They are crisp on the outside, yet juicy and succulent on the inside. They don't skimp on the sauce and there is plenty extra to dip my crust in. Usually when you order wings from a pizza place around here, they'll arrive soggy and congealed. At Ephesus the wings are not fatty and are well cooked.  I haven't tried one of their moroccan pizzas but that is next on the list. The last time I had food delivered from there, I did not think it took too long, but it was the owner who brought it and he said that I should order by phone rather than online and it will be quicker. So I guess it must take some time for the grubhub orders to go through or be acknowledged."}
{"text":"I love this please. I was visiting town. My Indian friend suggested this please. He eats most of his lunch from there. It is the best turkish pizza in US. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Food is amazing. The service isn't the same as it was before. Seems unorganized and I wish we didn't order online and leave a tip ahead of time. I think our food was actually finished when we came a few minutes after our set pick up time, but no one seemed to be able to locate it for a few minutes."}
{"text":"What a taste!!! Just obsessed with the food. Definitely try the Turkish food which is fabulous!! (mixed grill and Ephesus pide are one of my favorites)"}
{"text":"I've only been here once but plan to go back soon. They are conveniently located on the edge of Aspinwall and they have a fairly comprehensive menu for a pizza joint. 

My group tried the chorizo and fontilla pizza and it was mind-numbingly good. The crust was robust yet soft and doughy and the toppings were unexpected yet so well curated. None of us like olives, which come with that pizza, but we forgot to ask for them to be left off and the flavors of the pizza worked so well together that we all enjoyed the olives! That really says something! 

The staff was friendly and laid back. We had ordered over the phone and mentioned a coupon which we forgot to take along at pick up. No one cared and we still received our free cheesy bread sticks, which are really a generous sized pizza sans sauce, which we all loved. The grape leaves were a bit dry but still preferable to the overly saturated ones you find in cans or at the Greek olive bars in grocery stores. An order of grape leaves also meant complimentary garlic bread. This place does not skimp on carbs! 

Check out their menu and coupons. You're bound to find a flavor styling and deal that works for you!"}
{"text":"This place's food is great--I would suggest delivery though. They specialize in Turkish Pizzas (Pide) and wow they are good.  

When you walk into a place it looks like some cafeteria/game room that survived a tornado.  The walls are cracking, the only two florescent lights on the ceiling are flickering, there are display coolers that are turned off, and there are only vending machines to get drinks. You can see into an expansive kitchen (I really think the place is a converted cafeteria) and it looked horridly disorganized and in shambles.  That's fine though, I had heard good things about it

I got their Mediterranean Pizza (Tomatoes, Black Olives, Artichokes) and wow did it impress me. They either did one of two things: used a garlic glaze for the dough, which I am suspicious of because the crust didn't taste oily, or they have some kind of garlic butter in their dough. Either way, its fantastic. The whole thing was thick and fluffy with a perfect balance of fresh tomato sauce and cheese.  I loved it.  

The reason it gets four stars instead of five is that it just seemed to lack that \"holy shit\" factor that pushes things over the top. I think if their upped their quality of ingredients it would push it to five stars, but their clientele base seems fairly small, so hipsters, get in on the bottom floor of this fad. 

Definitely order delivery from them because the mezzanine level place is hard to get to and you have to get buzzed into the building."}
{"text":"The first pizza I ordered from Ephesus was really great. But the last two times I ordered I requested lite cheese and extra sauce, and it seemed my requests were totally disregarded.        
    The second pizza from Ephesus that I ordered about two weeks ago I ordered by phone and when I requested the lite cheese extra sauce the person taking my order seemed disinterested and made me feel rushed to get off the phone. When I picked up the pizza it was the exact opposite that I wanted it. It definitely had extra cheese and very little sauce.
   So today I decided to give them one more chance, I figured if I ordered online, at least my special request of lite cheese, extra sauce would be \"written\" down.
    So I am sure you all know where this is going!,I picked up the pizza, took it home, and there it was, extra cheese and hardly any sauce at all. My friend with whom I was sharing the pizza described it as \"cheesy bread\" and nothing more. We were in the mood for very good pizza and all we got was \"cheesy bread'.
    Not everybody likes tons of cheese on their pizzas some people like to relish the flavor of the sauce, which in this case was almost non-existent. Never again Ephesus, your indifference to my simple special request has lost you a potential regular customer."}
{"text":"Literally some of the best pizza that I've had in the 4.5 years that I have been in Pittsburgh. I've eaten here a couple of times and I have not had a bad experience yet. The pizzas are delicious, the gyros are wonderful, the falafel is yummy, and their simple cheese burgers and fries are touched by magic! The food is a bit pricier than the average college pizza shop, but I think it's worth it. I've never been inside the actual establishment, but I have had some issues with delivery....sometimes it seems like they pick and choose whether or not they want to deliver to certain locations around 15203. I understand that they have other locations in Bellevue and Aspinwall, but I haven't been to either."}
{"text":"My husband and I just moved here from the NYC area and we've been looking for a good pizza place. After trying a few different sub-par Pittsburgh pizzerias, we decided to try Ephesus last Friday night. We ordered one large spinach and feta pizza and one Italian calzone, via delivery. Even though it was prime-time on a Friday night, our pizza was delivered in 40 minutes and both things we ordered were DELICIOUS. The crust on the pizza was perfectly chewy and crusty, and the toppings were perfect. I think we've found our new pizza place!"}
{"text":"Really good food. I like the pides and the buffalo chicken pizza is delicious.

The only problem is their delivery is pretty bad. I've done delivery 3 times, and it was only on time once. Aim for a 1h15m wait if you're ordering."}
{"text":"Crazy good sesame bread, they make it fresh everyday. Lamb kebabs were very good,  came with bread, salad, French fries. We also got hummus, very fresh, and a pide. The place is such a complete dive that my husband wanted to turn around and leave,  but it is worth it. If I lived in Pitts, I'd eat that bread all the time.
They deliver, too, and are super friendly."}
{"text":"Incredible pizza. Dirty, rude, disgusting employees. I think that's actually their slogan."}
{"text":"Too oily , i felt like im eating pure fat , even the bread is covered with oil ! I suggest they make it healthier with more whole wheat option, grape leaves are very dry and tasteless. Oh and their fries are terrible"}
{"text":"This place is alright but they really should cook the pizzas thoroughly. I am happy to wait 45 minutes for a pizza. I hate ordering from this place and receiving a somewhat cooked pizza and having to cook it more while paying premium price. The centers of the pizzas, seemingly regardless of size, are always soggy and under-cooked. It is the only \"alright\" pizza place in Pittsburgh so that is why I give it 3 stars.

I want to add, though: I have always wondered why Ephesus doesn't just concentrate on their Turkish cuisine. NO ONE else in Pittsburgh does that and their kebobs are amazing. I feel their Turkish cuisine outshines their pizza by a lot as another person said in a review. It isn't that you don't make great pizza. It is just that you do other things more justice. Do those!"}
{"text":"I just got my pizza from Ephesus  for the 4th time and it's still of good quality. 
I ordered from the the one in Aspinwall,. They are always friendly on the phone and the same when it's delivered, 
The pizza is delicious. I am pretty much just an onion and green pepper, and sometimes cheddar cheese kind of guy, and the sauce and crust is awesome. I can only imagine how good those specialty pizzas are,"}
{"text":"Hello,

I have ordered from Euphesus for multiple functions at my place of employment and always had wonderful service. I order the moment I can at 10am in order to ensure the pizza is on time and correct. However, that is not what happened today. I ordered my 4 x-large pizzas at 10am online, and even called immediately after to have the time changed from 11:15am to noon to be delivered. The employee on the phone said that would be no trouble. I had placed in the special instructions for the pizza to be brought up to the main lobby and to have them call me, as I would have to leave my desk to come get it. At 12:18pm, with no phone call, a coworker and I went down to the lobby to wait. I called Euphesus and was placed on hold for two minutes with no one answering. I called back and immediately spoke with an employee, who informed me that our order was next and that they were short-staffed. I have worked in the food industry for years prior to this job and so I understand those situations. The employee informed me that they were just waiting for a driver to come back and when I misheard her and thought she said it would be twenty minutes, she assured me it would not take that long. I waited in the lobby until 12:55, when the driver called, finally arriving with my pizzas. The pizzas were lukewarm at best and I was still expected to pay full price for an order that was almost an entire hour late. As half of our team members only get a half an hour lunch, they were forced to sit and eat at their desks while doing work, as they had been waiting for this pizza since noon. The coworker who waited with me and I both lost our lunch hours waiting for this pizza that was NOT supposed to take 20 minutes...when, in fact, it took over a half an hour after I called.
 I am extremely displeased with this service. The employees should have called and informed me that this could occur and I would have cancelled the order, especially since I placed the order the minute I could at 10am. One of my coworkers even had to leave at 12:15 for an appointment and I assured her that she would receive pizza, which she is now not getting. This will be the last time we will use your company for any of our events for my area and I will inform others of this problem."}
{"text":"I have ordered from Ephesus several times in the past, have enjoyed their pizza, but was shocked by the terrible service and rude treatment we received last evening. We placed an online order at 7:24 p.m. We live ten minutes from Aspinwall where they are located. Delivery eta was 45 minutes. At 20 minutes past the expected delivery, I called to check status. They said our pizza was on the way. Another 20 minutes later I called. They said they'd call the driver. Fifteen minutes later I called and they said they'd call the driver again. I asked the woman her name and told her to refund my money. Silence. I asked her for her name again. She hung up! Ten minutes later the cold pizza arrived. Unacceptable. Such a disappointment! A simple, \"We are sorry. It's a busy night\" would've sufficed. Not from these folks. Business 101: don't piss off your customers. They'll tell everyone they know. This is a disreputable business that we will never order from again."}
{"text":"Delivery is always at least 20 minutes late and they never include the requested condiments. Food is okay but not good enough to warrant such a hassle."}
{"text":"My pizza was 20 min late, granted I live in the Mexican war streets and in an ally but the apartment building is clearly marked and is the only building with the front door facing the ally. He asked me to come outside and look for him...
Please if you can, order from the Bellevue location I used to live there and would order from them all the time. they never caused me problems."}
{"text":"Awesome selection of interesting pies. Had pizza delivered to my office and everyone was blown away with their pizzas of choice. I will definitely order from them again when I am feeling adventurous and looking to step away from the normal pizza."}
{"text":"Outstanding pizza!  As good as any I have ever had.  Perfect crust, plentiful and delicious toppings. We ate in, so it was hot. Not much ambience, but clean."}
{"text":"This place is hard to find.

Either go into the elevator and press M for mezzanine and the counter will be on your left with Cashier sign above it.

OR enter the unmarked door on the right hand side of the revolving door go up the steps through the crappy corridor and you'll eventually run into it.

Yes, it looks like you shouldn't even be there.  If you think you are in the wrong place, then you've likely found it.

The decor has been accurately described by others as broken down dorm public area.

With all this being said, the feta & ricotta pizza I had was delicious and cheap. $6.50 for a personal sized pizza. It was chock loaded with cheese and bacon and spinach. Very good. Food was great, decor and ambiance, horrible.

I'd advise just getting delivery."}
{"text":"After ordering from here my credit card number was stolen. Since this was the only place I had used it in a number of weeks, I can only assume it was stolen by someone here. Not a savvy business practice."}
{"text":"I work downtown late night and often forget to pack a lunch so ordering out is often the thing to do. My co workers and I have ordered from several places downtown and this place is in the top 3 for sure. Always quick with delivery, kind when speaking to, food hot and good! I don't remember all the items we've ordered but recently it was a pepperoni roll. Huge and delicious. No complaints!"}
{"text":"The pizza was pretty good. Beware: Do not use online ordering for the downtown location - they apparently don't check their computers. 2 hours after ordering the food, we finally got it. But not until we called the place did we find out that they hadn't made any of our food because well, they didn't check the computer orders. Okay mistakes happen. Whatever. The emailed price tells me $14.97. The driver who delivered the food tells us we owe $17.99. Either their driver is untrustworthy and lying about $3 because he really needs the money or is tired of being poorly tipped, or else the establishment is fraudulently charging more than the check states in the emailed receipts."}
{"text":"This is great food. It has slowly but surely become my go-to for delivery since moving to the Strip earlier this year. I have had their traditional pizzas, turkish (pide) pies, and various other items like chicken wings and even tried a pierogie order. It is consistently delicious. Would only avoid the 'triple pepperoni pizza,' it was the greasiest pie I have ever had to wrestle with; as I suppose looking back on one might expect from such a decadent creation."}
{"text":"Best delivery in PGH. They just customized my order by cutting my regular pizza in squares and made my night. I recommend the classic pizza and wings. To die for!

My favorite delivery in Pittsburgh by far. Make sure you get extra ranch always. They really went above and beyond tonight with my special order. It's refreshing to receive such wonderful service."}
{"text":"Ewww....just got lunch delivered from this joint and I'm utterly disappointed...the lettuce was brown and mushy I almost choked to death on the butt end of an iceberg lettuce! The fries were soggy and bland! The chicken sandwich had a gummy consistency like it was either old or not Cooked properly! If I could give no stars I would...also they served some strange off brand ketchup!!! That's a big no no in the burg! I'm considering calling for a refund!!!! I give credit where credit is due but ergh!!!! So many better options! Update: contacted grub hub and let them know about the order and I actually found my sandwich was raw! The restaurant absolutely refused to reimburse any of my money and was unwilling to work with the Grubhub customer service rep! Guess they will take anything they will get and really do not care about customer service! Crap food crap service!"}
{"text":"I'm from NY and this is my go to pizza spot in Pittsburgh! The delivery is quick, great coupons, and been very happy with all orders. Once in a while it's a little to greasy but other than that it's great and the ranch is on point!!!"}
{"text":"Great food pizza & wings.  Yelp's ordering online makes it sometimes too easy to order :)"}
{"text":"The pizza was so good! I got a spinach tomato and chicken pizza. The chicken was delicious and the crust was soft but still crispy on the outside. I highly recommend their pizza. The cigarette borek were a bit disappointing. I talked them up to my roommate because she never had them before. When I get them at other places, they are more flavorful and have a better texture. 

So the pizza is definitely the way to go when you order from here. I'm glad I decided to try this place even after seeing some negative reviews. I didn't have any issues with delivery. The delivery guy was nice and my order arrived on time. I noticed on the box that there are multiple locations so perhaps the other locations are not as good as the one downtown. 

This is my new favorite pizza delivery place!"}
{"text":"So being new to pittsburgh i have been disapointed with a lot of the delivery food and just food options in general. Took a chance on this place last night and im happy to say i will be a repeat customer until the food and service isnt the same. I really hope the rest of the menu is as good as the pizza. We ordered the steak ranchero pizza and OH MY LAWD.. .delicious probably the best pizza i have had in a long time. The delivery guy was super nice and called when he got to my place i met him at the door, he joked around we laughed and he even closed my door for me, gentleman. I would recommend this place to my friends."}
{"text":"Wow what great Pizza and Wings. I have a new favorite place when I visit Pittsburg.  Delivers right to my hotel room in Green Tree. Can't say enough about their food and quick service."}
{"text":"The food here is good, but the place only gets two stars because of the headache inducing customer service.  It's like no one knows ANYTHING.  They don't know the menu...they don't know their advertised specials...they don't know where bloomfield is in relation to downtown.  They've delivered to me in the past, but twice I've called and they say they don't deliever to my area...bloomfield...which is 10 min drive down liberty."}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken shish kabob pizza via GrubHub and the pizza came right on time. The delivery was super fast. The pizza was beautifully made with thin crispy crusts and the chicken shish kabobs were arranged on top. The shish kabob was a bit dry, but well seasoned. The side of ranch dressing was soooooo good with the hint of garlic. Probably one of the best ranch dressing I had in a while. I highly recommend this place if you're in the mood for something a little more exotic than your ordinary cheese pizza. Prices are on the higher end, but well worth it for the quantity and quality."}
{"text":"Found these guys on eat24, the delivery driver called to let me know he was close, really nice touch. The food was prompt and really good. They have killer sausage and I have had a couple hoagies, all fantastic."}
{"text":"Just moved to downtown Pittsburgh from NYC and this is the best delivery pizza I've come across so far. Prices are great and menu is really diverse, too! Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"We'd have never chosen this place had it not been one of the only places still open after 11 o'clock. So glad we did!

All of the food was great. My three-year-old and I split a white personal pizza with artichokes, feta, and sun dried tomatoes. It was delicious and plenty of food for both of us! We also had a traditional pizza and pirogies which were also good.

Prices were decent but more than you might spend elsewhere. The only bummer was that we were hoping for delivery, but they didn't have any drivers at the time. Other than that, it was a nice surprise!"}
{"text":"This place is fanfreakingtastic.  

Thusly, I have had their Chicken Ranchero Pizza and their Greek Pizza, and their cheesy breadsticks, and good. gravy.  I can't even put into words how good the pies were.  The toppings were all super fresh, the meat expertly seasoned, the sauces to die for.  Their list of gourmet pies is mindblowing; their variety and inventiveness is spectacular.  I was skeptical about feta and fontina on my pizza.  Mea culpa.  I don't know if I'll ever go back to just run of the mill plain pies ever again.

I've had my orders delivered all three times I've ordered from the place since moving there, and while they're a bit slow, it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"I used to love to order from here. I swear we ordered from here three or four times a month. Portion sizes have shrunk -- the hummus used to be huge now it is a tiny little serving but still costs the same. Also, a lot of items have been taken off the menu, such as eggplant. I used to be able to get rice as a side and now only fries are available. VERY SAD to see this happening! Food is still good, though."}
{"text":"Love this place its open late and the food is amazing, its literally a hidden gem its on the second floor of a business building. 

Came here at about 12:30 on a Tuesday night and it seemed like it was the only place open for food, while the decor was very kick back, like dorm kick back and you have to take a side door to go up and make a right passed the random shopping cart, the food was super serious. We ordered their special, 3 topping large pizza, wings and a 2 liter of soda for around $22.00, we didn't want the soda so they threw in extra wings, very cool.  It was going to take 15 minutes so we headed to Tavern 245 for a beer, then the bartender suggested we have the food delivered there so we called Ephesus and they did free of charge. 

The pizza was amazing.... it was so good, we ordered peperoni, sausage and mushrooms, which the pizza had plenty of all 3, I suggest you the sausage they have crumbled pieces all over the pizza.  The wings were also on point, very crispy and we got it with a side of spicy BBQ, so good, definitely found my late not spot in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I order food for delivery at my hotel. I got the chicken carbonara.  It came with salad and toast it was the BOMB. It was delivered piping hot and it was a lot of food I ordered he individual size and its enough for two people.  I also got slice of strawberry cheesecake."}
{"text":"delicious pizza.. terrible customer service! tried ordering for delivery (yes, it's winter and yes.. it's Pittsburgh!) they asked if we lived on a hill or a flat street. after my mother said we live on a hill, the girl who answered the phone placed us on hold. then a man came on the phone, spoke so softly we could hardly hear him. he asked what we wanted. went through the whole order. just for him to say \"the weather is very bad out\" and wouldn't deliver."}
{"text":"I have been ordering fast food from here for a long, long time.  My take is that the food is very high quality(even for fast food) and with the amount of choices you can make the selection is insane.  My only rub is that if you order delivery from here, most times it takes over an hour for them to arrive.  Yesterday I ordered at 4:47 p.m. and they were here at 5:50 p.m.  I got my order in before dinner time.  It was going from downtown to the southside which takes less than 15 minutes.  It was right around rush hour, but that's still very slow.  So if you want the best Middle Eastern fast food in the city you have to wait.  I think that their pide(Turkish pizza) is the best tasting pizza, period.  I got the pide deluxe which has turkish pepperoni and sausage on it with all kinds of other ingredients.  It was seriously the best pizza I have had in my life.  It was worth the wait for me.  Plus they give you little extras like a side salad with tsaziki and lemon dressing.  I am just prepared for that wait, but are you ever prepared to wait?  Maybe next time I will just order it at like 3 p.m., so I  won't be hungry."}
{"text":"Some of the best food we've ever had. You get SO MUCH food for what you pay! I got kebabs and my husband got a sub. Both deliciously amazing. 

We will say, the delivery time was very long. Although we were warned ahead of time when we ordered. About an hour and a half. But so worth the wait.

We will definitely get food from them again!"}
{"text":"First, let me preface this by saying. If you order from here, only get the pizza (the salads are inedible). 

If you are getting it delivered, they make mistakes extremely often and the owner will argue with you over the phone to the point that by the time you eat your food, it is ice cold. 

I have never had an owner argue and attack me verbally over the phone for ten minutes, it is truly a first. Not too mention when they put cheese on my pizza, after I expressly said no cheese six times, I cannot physically consume it, and after the owner have argued with me, it had been over an hour and a half since I had placed my order. 

You'd be better off ordering pizza at Taco Bell."}
{"text":"First the bad...the amount of oil and butter used in the making of this order would make Paula Deen proud...yet.....

The food was delicious!! I ordered a small cheese pizza with pepperoni, sausage, and extra cheese...it was enough to feed 3.. Just have wet naps available...and I ordered 6 breaded wings with garlic sauce...there were at least 2 sticks of butter remaining in the container after the wings were gone..and yes, they were devoured!! So good!!! 

Delivery was pretty quick as well..."}
{"text":"The Buffalo chicken pizza here is everything!! Delicious chicken + potato rounds make the pizza absolute perfection . Meatball sub is also amazing!!"}
{"text":"The customer service is kind of terrible. Like, be prepared to just stand in the lobby listening to people talk in the back ignoring your. They forgot sauce with my order which is always kind of annoying. 

The food wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either. Their buffalo fries are seriously sub par compared to other pizza places in the area. 

I didn't have their actual pizza though, so I may be back with an updated review."}
{"text":"OK, I tried this place primarily because I was trapped at a hotel and didn't have much option other than takeout.  Excellent food and speedy delivery though, better value for your money than the tourist traps down at Station Square.  Really enjoyed the Spinach and Feta pizza and the fettucine w/ meatballs.  Definitely underrated."}
{"text":"Yes, the food's quite good (and cheap).

BUT: the place itself is probably enough to turn me off from eating there again.  Imagine the sketchiest dorm room you've ever been in.  Now imagine it 5 times as big and it serves pizza.

Thinking, \"Hmm, I wonder if the kitchen is as dirty as the seating area\" is not something I'm okay thinking once in a while.  No, I never want to be thinking that.

I wouldn't go back.  Call me a snob; I am.  But ugh, just too run-down for me."}
{"text":"Look, I get it...you come to Pittsburgh and you go to the usual spots - Primanti Bros and Meat & Potatoes - but this should certainly be on your list! On our last night in town I told my boyfriend I wanted pizza and somehow he pulled this recommendation from Yelp and it was one of our favorite meals of the week! We looked at some more \"regular\" pizzas that we normally go for and then decided to be adventurous and picked the lamb kabob pizza! OMG we were NOT disappointed!  The crust is delicious and soft and flavorful and the lamb was AMAZING! If you're in the area - make the stop. Reasonable prices for the food you get and it was so great I only wish we had gone earlier in the week so we could have had it more than once! YUM!"}
{"text":"The food was delivered earlier than suggested, and it was simply delicious! I will absolutely order from Ephesus again when I am in Pittsburgh. Thank you guys for the fast delivery and the fantastic food."}
{"text":"I tried the hummus, felafel, and grape leaves, and it was mostly excellent, except that the grape leaves did not seem home made.

The staff is very friendly and the service is quick. 

The dining room is just 4 tables, but most of their businesses is take-out."}
{"text":"Awesome, awesome, awesome!  I have walked by this place for years when it was in its old location which was a bit hidden.  Now, it is out in full glory on 4th Ave near PPG Place.  I had the chorizo and manchego pizza for one.  The amount of veggies - cooked to perfection - on top was astounding.  Mounds of onions and peppers, sauteed but with a bit of crunch still. The chorizo was spicy and chewy.  A bit hard to eat honestly, I would have cut it into smaller pieces.  It also had tiny morsels of kalamata olives, capers, fresh parsley and delicious and not common manchego cheese.  The crust was awesome - crunchy yet chewy.  The sauce was awesome.  All was good."}
{"text":"This place so the go to for all your pizza and hoagie needs. Everything they make is flavorful and perfectly cooked. I never have any regrets ordering here."}
{"text":"Never had anything from here that wasn't amazing, used to get it weekly until I moved away, reasonable prices and fast delivery if there is any complaints about the food they are liars!"}
{"text":"Hmmm so conflicted when writing this review... We ordered delivery later on Monday night, and were told that our order would be there in 25 minutes. After I called twice to make sure they didn't forget our food, our order showed up an hour and a half after ordering. If someone would have even said something like \"Hey, something went wrong tonight, we're sorry it took so long\" or anything like that, we would have been understanding. We've both worked in the food biz for years and understand that stuff happens. But nothing was done to make the situation better, or even so much as apologize for the wait either over the phone or by the delivery driver. Plus, when we got our food (pizza) it was very cold and we could tell that it was sitting in the car for a while, not in a hot bag. 
  That being said, even after microwaving the pizza, it was really, really good! Perhaps the taste was influenced by our hunger at 11pm by that point, but we both agreed it was incredible. 
  So service-wise, I would give 1/5 stars, but food would get 5/5, so I went with 3 stars. Still unsure as to whether or not I'd order again.... :/"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS. Seriously, the best pizza I've ever had so far and completely unexpected! I had friends tell me their pizza was good, but I didn't imagine it was this good. 

I had to have the buffalo chicken pizza and boy am I glad I did! The toppings are LOADED on... The chicken is moist and there are fried potato slices. The cheese is so good and the crust is crisp on the outside, yet so soft on the inside. Excellent! We've also ordered the lamb and chicken kebab pizza that come with individual generous kebabs on top of the pizza!

The hummus is to die for and the pita bread makes it even better! So soft and completely addicting. My only recommendation is to order more bread than what comes with the hummus!

I work in the area, so we've had our orders delivered and they always arrive before the expected time, which is great! I love that they offer personal size pizzas, which are an extremely generous portion and well worth every penny. I highly recommend Ephesus!!"}
{"text":"For delivery food i say this place is great. Ordered three times already. The gyro salad is awesome i got this house made vinaigrette it was so good, the moroccan chicken plum pizza w spicy sauce was awesome and the spinach ricotta pizza to die for. Order here you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I travel to Pittsburgh for work, so I feel like I have tried most of the restaurants in the city. I hadn't tried this place yet and was in the mood for pizza. I ordered the Mediterranean pizza and it was a little greasy but all in all pretty delicious. I would recommend."}
{"text":"Pizza was delicious and delivery was fast! Soft yet crispy bubbly crust and fresh veggies. We'll definitely be ordering from them again"}
{"text":"Wonderful fresh interesting food combining Mediterranean and Turkish flavor in unique dishes.  Try everything....gyros, salads, Turkish pizzas, spinach and feta pizza and humos and kepaps.  Enjoy this fresh food!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in downtown Pittsburgh. The place is a hole in the wall so its easy to miss and often gets passed up-do yourself a favor and stop in. Order a specialty pizza and you won't be disappointed. I always order either the greek, which is basically a gyro in pizza form, or the buffalo chicken, which comes with buffalo fries on top. I've also tried the meat lovers, sausage, and mushroom pizzas. I usually hate mushrooms but the pizza itself was so yummy that I didn't even mind the mushrooms."}
{"text":"This out-of-the-way Mediterranean eatery is priced super low for the quality it serves up. I highly recommend the lamb kabob pie, although the rest of the menu is great too. Please, if you're in the area, stop in and give it a try. The Wait time for the order might be a bit long, but it is well worth it.

Pros: excellent cuisine, great, friendly staff.

Cons: easily passed-by, they would do well to invest in better, more obvious signage to mark their smallish location."}
{"text":"We liked the taste of our asparagus pizza and chicken shish kabob. The popcorn chicken was very small. The humus tasted just OK. The gyro platter was not actually a platter and was just a gyro. The delivery driver called to tell us to come outside to his car to get our food. We told him to come to our door. He did not even say thank you for our business."}
{"text":"This was my second time ordering in from this Ephesus because I keep getting their ad in my mailbox and I'm really impressed. The first time we ordered we just got a regular pizza and we were surprised to get a really delicious pizza delivered to our door within 30 minutes.

This time we went for something unique and ordered the gyro special with fries and also the Pide with Soujcuk and egg (Turkish pizza). We both absolutely loved both items. I was surprised to get such a delicious gyro from a take out joint and the Turkish pizza was great for something different!

Will definitely order again."}
{"text":"I stopped into Ephesus tonight with CM and two good friends before attending the PSO's concert at the Three Rivers Arts Festival.  We were planning to get take out and have a picnic at the concert, but alas, rainy weather struck (surprise, surprise!), so we ended up having dinner here before heading over to Heinz Hall, where the concert had been relocated due to the weather.

CM and I ordered a medium Moroccan spiced chicken and plum pizza to share ($14.99), and our friends each ordered pide, with one ordering the Ephesus, and the other ordering the soujcuk ($9.49 each).  Both CM and I enjoyed the complex medley of flavors and textures comprising the chicken/plum pizza, which was complemented by a cup of seemingly homemade ranch sauce served with the pizza.  The plums were dried, and weren't overwhelmingly sweet or fleshy, and lent the perfect hint of sweetness to the savoriness of the chicken and the spicy kick of the sauce.  The sliced nuts (almonds, I believe) were also a nice touch, and the size was more than enough for the two of us.  My only major criticism was that the myriad of toppings made the pizza a bit unwieldy to eat, and often fell off as we ate it.

The pide were rather long and thin in profile, and were each topped by a pepper.  I didn't try the Ephesus version, which is topped with ground beef, due to my aversion for that meat.  I did try a slice of the sojcuk pide, however, which is topped with cheese and Turkish pepperoni.  While the pepperoni were different in flavor than traditional pepperoni, the overall effect was reminiscent of eating traditional pizza that just happens to be long and thin.  I didn't try the greens that came with the pide, but they seemed similar to those used to top the chicken/plum pizza, and our friends weren't fans of the sauce, which they found rather oily and flavorless.  However, I did try the tzatziki sauce served with their pide, which was thick and had a great cucumber-yogurt zip.

One important thing to note is that Ephesus seems to have relocated since several of the previous reviews were written--they are now located at street level on 4th Ave., and the space is actually rather nicely decorated for a pizza parlor.  Having said that, judging from the amount of phone calls and runs of the delivery guy, the majority of their business still seems to consist of delivery.  Overall, we were pleased with our experience, and would return to try some of their other offerings."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery for lunch with another person at wrok. I ordered spagetti & meatballs he had Seafood ALfredo pasta. We saw all the good reviews and this was our first time. We should have sticked to the pizza or hogies. The spagetti & meatballs was some of the worst I ever had. Wide think noodles with what appearded to be pizza suace. The meatballs were very low quality meat, meaning gristle in some and they were not hot spicy but like oregano. Like someone dumped an entire container in. Just way over the top. I couldn't eat much of either the pasta or meatballs. They do give you quite a bit of food but it is in my oponion aweful, low quality, and an after thought. Why not just take it off the menu and do what you do best. Pizza.
My friends seafood pasta alfredo was klacking the seafood and the white sause tasted like it was straight from a jar. Bad taste and he said he would never order it again. Again it had the wide noodles that you would expect from an alfredo. But apparently they use one pasta for all. Very chocky taste
Again, why not just stick to what you do best rather than lose a new customer. Maybe others may like these two selections but I just dont know how. Again just stick to what you do best and dont try to pass other stuff off as the real deal. We will not be back. Lunch for two with tip was $30"}
{"text":"So I'm at my friend's place on the North Side and we wanted pizza, and it's like midnight or so, and Ephesus was one of very few places delivering at the time. So we gave it a go even though we weren't sure what \"Turkish Pizza\" was. I ordered the traditional Turkish pizza aka the Pide because why not.

When it came, the shape was a little...umm...odd. I'm not even going to venture into what one of my friends said it looked like because then you might be grossed out, and you shouldn't be grossed out, because the pizza was really good! I'm a pizza traditionalist, but this wasn't even really pizza. It was just some doughy bread with cheese, spinach, and eggs on it. But it tasted delicious, so who cares what they want to call it? And the side salad that it came with was delicious as well!

Everyone was kind of mad that it wasn't really a pizza, but me and friend-who-lives-on-North Side both liked it more than a pizza at that moment in time and agreed we'd definitely order again!"}
{"text":"3 stars, friends loved the pizza. Every piece I picked up fell right apart. It's okay."}
{"text":"Nice place. The staff is nice
Definitely mom and pop shop. The pizza was good and the prices were a little high. I happened to try their pide because I've never had it, and let's say it was not pleasing to the American pallet. It was too spicy and no cheese! If you like plain pizza stay away from the pide. Their commercials are always on TV. If your looking for a good pizza place try milanos."}
{"text":"I tried this for the first time a few weeks ago while hanging out downtown with my brother and sister. It was one of the most surprisingly delicious pizza's I've ever had in my life. I'm more of a thicker crust type, but this thin crust was absolutely perfect.

We had the Mediterranean and Barcelona gourmet pizzas, and both were very well put together. The Barcelona comes highly recommended if you don't mind a little bit of a kick as it is made with spicy pepper sauce.

It's just a small little pizza joint on a side street (although I believe my brother said it used to be in a different location), but it's a huge find in a really big city. Check it out if you get the chance."}
{"text":"While they specialize in Mediterranean food, they seem to also have a bunch of the standard American fast-food options, from plain pizzas to burgers to wings and other appetizers. That said, I'll probably stick to the specialty pizzas next time. They have a whole list of different combinations, and all of them look really interesting. Tried the spinach and chicken, which came with a large helping of both toppings and white sauce. The improvement would be that they could use less oil, as others have suggested."}
{"text":"I ordered the boneless wings with garlic sauce and they were terribly hard as well as salty. Delivery was fine but the food was terrible. Never ordering from them again."}
{"text":"The popcorn chicken is not chicken. It is small 'popcorn sized' pieces of friend breading.  Literally if the over 200 or so pieces (that's how small) maybe 15 had chicken in them. We were super dissapointed in this but the two specialty piZzas were good. Bbq Hawaiian and gyro.  Great for pizza not for popcorn 'chicken' wink wink"}
{"text":"Without a doubt this has to be one of my favorite places to get pizza in the city of Pittsburgh. My girlfriend introduced this spot to me a few months back and it has been difficult to spend money on pizza any where else. It started when we ordered one of their specialty pizzas, the veggie breakfast pizza! Toppings included spinach, green peppers, tomato, onion, mozt cheese and scrambled eggs. Hands down one of the best pizzas I've ever eaten. 

The quality of ingredients is the biggest stand out. Starting with the crust which is hand tossed, just has the perfect taste. Soft on the inside, a little crunch on the outside. Then you make your way to the awesome cheese and hefty toppings. I've been to a few great pizza places in my life and Ephesus is atop of the pack.

Bottom is this, if you are in the Pittsburgh area and you don't want to waste money on basic pizza, go to Ephesus. You will not be disappointed in the quality or the taste. Always fresh, and the selections seem endless. My girlfriend does not eat red meat, so at most pizza shops we usually are limited in the protein toppings. At Ephesus we are able to choose from their large chicken specialty pizza options and a ton of veggie toppings too! Seriously a win-win for everybody! Ephesus is the way to go!"}
{"text":"The Moroccan Spiced Chicken and Dry Plum pizza is an exotic treat! I also liked their cinnamon sticks to death! Very good. I can't believe they delivered to us all the way from downtown in such short time. Awesome pizza joint."}
{"text":"I recently ordered a three topping pizza and a gyro platter. The best French fries around. I was shocked to see that they weren't shoestring or limp & soggy \"fresh cut\" fries. They were hot,  crispy, and not overly salty. The gyro was just ok, the pita was a little over done.

The pizza was great, I especially liked the sauce they used. It was nice to see mushrooms not from a can. One issue was I thought the toppings are a little pricey.

I will probably eat here on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Great Steak Deluxe Sub. Pizza was good.
They delivered to my hotel at 11:30pm
Highly recommended at least for late night hotel delivery"}
{"text":"This is the best place (IMO) that delivers to Troy Hill.  Please allow an hour at least for delivery.  It is worth it.

In the past I've had the regular pizzas (sausage, pepperoni, etc) from there.  Always delicious.  Today I decided to try some of their other selections:

Moroccan Spiced Chicken and Dry Plum Pizza (SOO GOOD)
Pide with Pastirma (WONDERFUL)
Beets (I had a craving.  Really really good!)

Delivery was only 5 minutes past the GrubHub estimate.  Driver polite and friendly as has always been my experience with them.

I'm usually stingy with the stars, but as it is so hard to find good food delivered to Troy Hill (not counting using Meals Delivered), I'm going for it.  Five stars!"}
{"text":"I've only ordered delivery, never been to the actual restaurant, but the food is excellent... plus the expansive menu and list of toppings is a win.  Delivery can be a bit slow and on occasion someone will answer the phone whose English is a bit shaky, but for the most part it's solid.  The Pizza and Hoagies are excellent, their wings are pretty good as well.  Their Pasta and Salad's are okay, the burgers are mneh, but from a Pizza joint you couldn't expect more."}
{"text":"I have never ever had a bad meal from here! Their Turkish pizza is out of this world. I usually get the pide with gyro. Their hummus is a must order as well."}
{"text":"I have eaten here probably 50 times and it is usually a weekly go to place. However, lately the quality of the food hasn't been up to par. I am not sure if they are using less quality ingredients, or just not putting in the right effort to prepare properly. Lately there has been a gritty taste to the meat they use on Lahmajuns and Pides. It literally tastes like there is sand in the meat. Worse than that is that they just jacked the prices up. The thin crust Ephesus Pide, for example, used to cost $7.48 with tax, but now it costs $9.62. A 28.6% markup is a bit steep considering inflation was about 2% last year. Now mind you, this place looks like crap, smells like crap, has employees that look like crap and you can only wonder what the kitchen looks like. To top it off, they are consistently slow in preparation. $10 for lunch at a quasi fast food pizza shop that isn't even fast is not a bargain. I am sad to cross this place off my usual spots."}
{"text":"Had the gyro salad and fettuccine  alfredo delivered. Both portions were huge.  The pasta also came with garlic bread and side salad. Everything was delicious. I didn't think it was expensive for the amount of food we got. Everyone was polite. I will be ordering again."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a shot because they are so close to where I live. On 420 I ordered a veggie personal pizza with white sauce for my beautiful girlfriend and I ordered a medium pizza with pepperoni mushroom onion for myself. I go to pick it up and the lady working acted like she had no idea where my order was and then she gave me two personal pizzas (mess up #1) she said she will make my medium pizza and to give her 10 min so I wait, she eventually comes out with a medium pizza I take it to my car open the box and there is no pepperoni on the pizza (mess up #2) I go back in to tell the lady that there is no pepperoni and she tells me that I never ordered pepperoni so I take my phone out and show her my online order and all she says is 5 minutes. We finally make it back home to eat the pizza and my girlfriends pizza is made with red sauce when we ordered it with white sauce (mess up #3) My pizza was not even edible, the was pizza was not even cut and the whole pie was absolutely drenched in grease. It was like trying to eat a pizza that sank to a bottom of a swimming pool. Will not be returning, very frustrated with how much money I wasted on this establishment."}
{"text":"Hard to find location, and zero atmosphere (there are old car tires in the place, along with an aging ping pong table) but the pizza is why you came and it does not disappoint. Recommend for a dive pizza meal."}
{"text":"If you're in the market for a buttload of carbs, look no further. This is a good local pizza shop! They have a huge menu with a lot of unique pizza offerings, many with a Mediterranean influence (for example, Morrocan chicken and spiced plum pizza, which is surprisingly tasty). They also have the standard make-your-own pizza toppings and the usual specialty pizza suspects (white pizza, buffalo chicken pizza). In general, they make a solid pie. Their crust is slightly sweet and more on the doughy than crispy side (which I happen to prefer). Their red pizza sauce is also slightly sweet, but well-balanced with acidity from the tomatoes and well seasoned. And, importantly, they don't skimp on the cheese or on the toppings, which is appreciated.

What I like even more than the pizza, however, are their non-pizza apps and meals. For example, their boneless wings are surprisingly delicious for being made at a pizza shop. They're large and meaty with a nice crunchy coating and doused in your choice of sauce (I'm a fan of the honey BBQ sauce). I also like their pasta dishes -- they make a really good chicken parm pasta dinner (which, again, I did not expect at a pizza joint). I'd also recommend their subs -- they are generous with the fillings, and the bread they use is really hearty and chewy. They also offer several Turkish specialties (Pide (Turkish pizza), kabobs, babaganoush, etc.). I've not sampled many of these, but I look forward to working my way through that part of the menu soon!

Overall, I think it's great that there is such a huge variety of items that you can order from this one shop. Prices are fairly reasonable too -- just be sure to grab one of their menu flyers (or look online) and don't order anything before checking our their deals. They offer TONS of coupons and specials, so take the time to check out their flyer to make sure you don't miss a chance to save money!"}
{"text":"A little over a year ago I was introduced to Ephesus by a person I will forever be grateful for. Everything I've ever eaten from here has been delicious and even if you leave the pizza out for a really long time it remains nothing short of amazing.

The gourmet pizzas are always a go-to, and I've eaten almost all of them besides the ones with tons of meats and been impressed every time. The Moroccan chicken and dates pizza is super unique and one of my favorites. BBQ chicken or the veggie omelet breakfast pizza would be up there on the list of favorites, too.

For as good as the pizza is, the price at Ephesus is really fair. Sometimes parking is a pain, but if you don't mind walking a block or two for some killer pizza, I'd recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"Some people from work ordered food from here tonight. All I got was a piece of walnut baklava, but MAN. It was to die for delicious. And when I got a whiff of everyone else's food, I wished I had ordered some too because it smelled REALLY good. Next time I'll try the pizza."}
{"text":"The food is excellent, but the prices keep going up. Still, it must be worth it because we keep ordering from them. If you've never tried tiramisu, you should definitely order one. Savor it!"}
{"text":"I have only ordered delivery from Ephesus on 4th Ave.; I never physically ate at this location. With that said, let's talk about the quality of their food options and their delivery. First off, they have a wide selection of food options. While they are primarily a pizza place, they also offer Turkish cuisine, burgers and fries, and pasta selections as well. Their pizza - freshly made to order - is actually quite good. I mostly order pizza from here. Their other options are also very good. I have only tried their pizza and pasta options, and while the food is very good, sometimes their delivery runs rather a bit slowly. Just take note when ordering delivery: there is a 60% chance of them running later than their estimated time frame. Other than that, the delivery guys are quite nice, and the food is good enough to wait for."}
{"text":"Did take out from there and had the gyro pizza, it was very good and cooked to perfection, i just wish they would have given a side of tziki sauce instead of ranch.  I also got the tiramisu for dessert while it was tasty it was not worth 5 bucks.  I would do take out or delivery not really a dine in type place."}
{"text":"Large portions, excellent services amazing taste. I'm was in from North Carolina the weather was awful they delivered definitely worth it. I don't do 5 stars alway room for improvement but this was excellent dinner"}
{"text":"Really good food. Typical pizza joint but with a Mediterranean flare.   White pizza is absolutely amazing!  Some of the best in town."}
{"text":"In my boyfriend's words, \"How could you even make a pizza that bad? Did an earthquake happen and make all the toppings fall off the shelf onto the pizza? It looks like the salad bar just threw up on the pizza.\"

Delivery took over an hour, but worse is the fact that the pizza was completely smothered in nearly raw onion, peppers, mushrooms, and sausage. I am more tolerant of raw onions than many people, but undercooked sausage is just plain gross. And of course the crust was totally soggy, so picking up a slice just made half the toppings fall on the plate anyway. Won't be trying this place again."}
{"text":"Delivered exactly when and what they said they would with great tasting pizza. Ordered late on a Saturday night to a hotel room and they were right on it."}
{"text":"All I have to say is they need to learn customer service...The driver that came out was so rude I can't believe they even would hire someone with that kind of attitude...As I was receiving my food the driver says to me \"Don't call for delivery if you are not going to tip..get pick up\" First of all, I order from Ephesus quite a lot so for the driver to feel some sort of entitlement for a tip is beyond me granted he was going to get one I just wanted to get my food first but because of that he got nothing..and thats exactly how you lose customers. I will tell you one thing, tips aren't MANDATORY. This is the job you chose and you know what kind of pay it comes with, I have no problem giving tips to people who deserve them but not someone of that demeanor...You lost a customer as my family was a big fan of the food but with that being said I would never recommend this place to anyone and if anyone asks, Don't go here. The food can be amazing but that dosen't make up for terrible customer service."}
{"text":"I ordered 2 pizzas, a gyro and fries for a special recognition for one of my co-workers. we chose this restaurant because of the ratings and wanting to try something new. I ordered through grub hub. the order was to include a free cheesy bread and two-2 litre drinks. there was a spot to leave instructions. I asked that the pizzas be cut into squares (they show it this way in a photo) and for one of the drinks to be diet. After not receiving the food for 30 minutes past the promised time, I called. I spoke politely, asking when my food would be delivered and was hung up on. I called back in 15 minute increments (each time being given a different excuse) they could not get ahold of the driver, there was traffic. I explained that this was for a celebration and if they would just let me know so that if it wasn't coming I could order from another restaurant. They finally agreed to cancel the order. This was more than 2 hours after I had placed the order. As soon as I hung up the phone, the food was delivered. I did not receive the free cheesy bread and the drink order was incorrect. the pizza was not sliced into squares and I did not receive any French fries. I sent s message to grub hub and they said they talked to the establishment and there is nothing they can do about it. I would be careful ordering food here. The service was very poor."}
{"text":"Great gyro wrap for under $5!  Fresh, fast, and healthy!

However,  if you're going past 10PM at night, make sure you have your cell phone with you so you can call them.  (It was a late night snack for us...)

We walked around for 20 minutes in downtown Pittsburgh (I know, we were brave), and up the block, down the block, we couldn't find this place!  We decided to go back to our hotel at Station Square. 
In a brilliant moment, I then pulled out my Yelp app on my phone and looked up their number.

Our conversation went a little like this,
Me: \"Um, yeah, are you open right now?\"
Guy: \"Yes.\"
Me: \"Um, how do I get in?\"
Guy: \"There isn't a guy down there?\"
Me: \"No.\"
Guy: \"Guy with a T-shirt?\"
Me\" \"No.\"
Guy: \"Are you down there right now?\"
Me: \"Um, yes...\" (not really, I was a block away)
Guy: \"Ok, he's going to come down now and let you in.\"
Me.....hauling tail to get back to catch the guy in T-shirt


Weird, I know, but thought I'd save you the \"scary\" stroll in downtown Pittsburgh looking lost.  Trust me, you don't want to get lost down there.

It is a really cool place. Tourists or students alike, TRY IT OUT!

They're open late!"}
{"text":"In the mood for pizza and salad so decided to try Ephesus Pizza.  I was given a menu from the hotel.  First the plus - large menu with unique items (Gyro meat on a pizza). Now the important stuff:  Lots of choices for their pizzas.  Their crust has medium thickness.  The taste:  OK but nothing great.  The salad was OK.  Delivery service was very quick.  

Will not be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Best place for gourmet pizza and middle eastern delivery. I'm not allowed to leave my station at work and I frequently forget breakfast and then crash at 10am, turning into a potentially homicidal maniac. I also have a sensitive stomach so the vending machine is not my friend. I order the vegetable breakfast pizza from Ephesus and it's always fresh and perfect, with grilled vegetables and no burnt or mushy bits. My other favorite is an asparagus pizza with a gluten-free crust. My carnivorous coworker likes their large steak hoagies because you are getting actual steak, and not re-heated \"soup meat\".
The salads are pretty good, too. Most pizza places just sell boxed salads, but even their salads are fresh."}
{"text":"I only gave this place 2 stars because of the environment that it is in.  A \"hard to find place\" is an understatement if it's dark outside and you have never been here.   I have to agree, the crust of the pizza is amazingly flakey and delicious.  I'm a crusty guy, so I like good crust and though it's up there with a soft boboli it's still easy to eat and won't rough up your mouth.  I ordered the Ephesus Pizza with lamb skewers ($16.00 large).  It is a white pizza with minimal ingredients except for the lamb skewers.  They packed on 8-9 small skewers of lamb and I have to admit, the lamb was very tasty and tender.  The problem I have with this place is the filthy, trash laden environment it sits in.  It's on the mezzanine level (2nd floor) of a some financial building and when I got there, the exterior doors to the building were locked and luckily a group of people showed up and punched in the code to get one of the side doors opened...it was strange.  However, when you walk in that side door, I was faced with the stairwell with trash cans spewed about.  when I entered the pizza/sandwich joint, it was in disarray, bread was in crates on the floor and trash cans were overflowing.  The bathroom was in a construction zone and filthy.  All of this added up to being afraid to eat anything because you were unsure as to how fresh the food was and how well kept the kitchen may or may not have been.  I'm not a fluffy guy, but I need some fluff in my establishments...look clean, feel clean, feel safe and I can live with whatever you dish out, but when first impressions are nasty and dirty, it hits homeplate way before the food hits my mouth.   I still like the pizza and I will only send my pot smoking, beer drinking partying friends to this place, because I would be afraid of what others may think of it and consequently, think of me and my tastes."}
{"text":"Really happy with the Greek pizza and the bacon/provolone fries. Speedy delivery to our hotel downtown. Would definitely order again!"}
{"text":"I had the Greek pizza with gyro meat and it was truthfully the best pizza that I've had in a very long time. I highly recommend stopping in and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent Turkish pizza as well as other varieties. Good online ordering system that lets you place it at little as 20 minutes in advance. Halal meat!"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza I have found in Pittsburgh so far. It makes me sad that it has taken me four years of tasting quite mediocre pizza before finding this gem. So far my favorite is the steak pizza, however, it is all delicious."}
{"text":"First of all, this is some of the BEST pizza in the burgh. It is certainly my favorite. Their sandwiches and other options are also very good, and be sure to try the Pide, turkish pizza. 

The first few times I had the pizza, we had ordered it to our office, so I hadn't been to the space. At one point, my co-workers and I tried to go to the shop, and were confused / not aware that is was on the second floor, and the elevators were not working, or something. It's kinda frustrating because we just never made it to the place, and I missed out on this delicious pizza for an entire year after that. 

But when I finally made it to the place, it reminded me of a college dorm rec room that happened to sell pizza. Random furniture, a large tv playing soccer with foreign commentators, complete with a ping pong table and vending machines. 

The staff is friendly and service is quick, but not too quick. It is pretty clear that they make everything to order. And it's all delicious."}
{"text":"Got a couple of slices of pizza from Ephesus today for lunch. I ordered a slice of pepperoni and a slice of sausage.  It only took about five minutes for my pizza to be ready. Slices were large, hot, the crust was crispy and it held up well to the generous amount of cheese and toppings on it.  I paid $5.33 for both slices which I would consider a bargain for the quantity and quality that I got. Not the best pizza I ever had but it sure was tasty. I'd go back again."}
{"text":"Sure... not everything on the menu is done well. And, sometimes there are consistency issues. But, one word... lahmajun. It's a very thin pizza crust topped with a delicious Turkish meat sauce. That's it. You get two 4 slice crusts (8 slices total) in one approximately $10 order and I crave it. The hummus is quite delicious too. And, the 2 gyros and fries deal is cheaper than any other pizza shops around. Consistency is not always on the side of absolutely delicious with the gyros. But, the lahmajun will keep me coming back again and again. Their cheesy bread sticks are also quite good. Terrible for you. But, good. Give Ephesus a try :)"}
{"text":"I ordered a single pizza, the chorizo and fontinella.

It was very memorable from positivity. 

The sauce was excellent - not sweet at all, slightly acidic and very fresh. Close to just tomatoes and basil, and finely crushed and blended. 
The bread was well-risen, crispy on the outside and soft on the interior. 
The red peppers stood out - particularly perfectly cooked, just barely blackening along their edges and soft throughout.

This pizza was from a creative and thoughtful menu, I look forward to trying more of it.

Update: January 1st, 2018
Initially, this review was 5/5. 
New experience: 
I ordered a pide(excellent, excellent item) to the incorrect address. Upon calling Ephesus to change the address (moments after submitting order via grubhub) I was told this was where the pizza will end up. An hour later, I called again and was again told the pizza would reach the correct address. 3 hours after the order being placed, I called back to ask for a refund and was rudely told to contact grubhub, because they deal with refunds. A very poorly co-ordinated system; there were repeated failures for the restaurant to communicate with the drivers, and very inept handling of those failures."}
{"text":"Food is awesome! But service hell noooo! Terrible!
I was waiting for pick up so long and also women who works there was rude!"}
{"text":"\"The Pilgrim\" gourmet pizza!! I hope they keep this on the menu year round, and it is not just seasonal. Tangy goat cheese and cranberry sauce with whole berries, sweet red peppers, turkey (or ham), and other cheeses. Total yum-fest. I keep coming back, and the pizzas are consistently fantastic."}
{"text":"So, a co-worker of mine said that she had a taste for \"pide\" and would I like to join her for lunch.  To myself, \"Um, what the heck is \"pide\"?  However, I told her, \"Yes, that sounds pretty good\".  So down the street and around the corner and into a building tucked away on Fourth Street, Downtown, we go!  After giving the secret handshake and being sworn to silence, we enter what looks like a vacant space and order \"pide\" (Turkish pizza).  OMG!  Who knew that anything like Turkish pizza existed?  It was so tasty!

Pide does not look like pizza; Shaped like a flat football with pinched ends and filled with eggs, cheese and spinach, it was unusual but wonderful.  My co-worker, who frequently eats vegetarian meals turned me on to this and I couldn't thank her enough.
Since the pide was so tasty, I decided to try one of the Ephesus gourmet pizzas with kebabs.  You can order either chicken or lamb kebobs and I ordered half of each on my pizza.  I thought that they would slice the kebab meat and stick on the pizza, but no!  Each slice has its own kebab!  Yippee Skippee!  The best way to eat it is to hold the skewer inside the slice and then wrap the pizza slice around the kebab meat.  Mmmm Mmmm Good!

Ephesus' Downtown Pittsburgh location has since moved closer to PPG Plaza and more easily accessible, which is a good thing.  They also now have a location in Aspinwall which is closer to my home and boy am I glad.  I took a friend visiting from out of town there and he ordered the Moroccan Spiced Chicken and Dried Plum pizza.  I would have never associated those ingredients with pizza, but they were tasty too!

Don't go there looking for fawning service or an elaborate atmosphere...It's not that place.  However, if you want to try delicious pizza with unusual toppings and an excellent crust, this is your place!"}
{"text":"Got delivery. Took an 1 hour 40 minutes to arrive (they said it would be about 40).   No apology when I called in to ask about the wait, and also got attitude from the delivery guy. The pita I got was half-cold and stale. The gyro was plain and didn't have a ton of flavor. If I was eating there and the food was fresh it might get 3 stars, but the delivery experience was pretty bad."}
{"text":"I adore Ephesus.  Super under-rated.  It's a pizza place with a Turkish background so in addition to making some pretty decent pizza, they serve traditional turkish/middle- eastern fare like kefta, falafel, baba, hummus- and its really good!

Their Adana Koeffte platter is to die for.  And I just tried a new item yesterday called a \"pide\" (pe-day)- its a \"turkish pizza\" (shaped kinda like a football with a thinner, different \"crust\") topped with ground spiced meat, diced tomato, spinach, cheeses- I lost my mind, it was amazing.  I am going back later this week to get another.  maybe two!

Oh, and they deliver!  to half the city!  I don't even have to leave my house!"}
{"text":"If you haven't tried their meat lovers pizza... you need to it's very flavorful. Also the Anatolian Salad is very good...very similar to a Greek salad but they use Turkish dressing. The ranch dressing is homemade and if you like ranch with your pizza you're going to love it."}
{"text":"'Twas a bleak Friday evening for pizza options. Krazy Brothers is gone. Slice on Broadway is terrific, but we'd ordered from them a few times already. The same holds true with Molly's. A scan of our local Pennysaver tabloid turned up no new pizza restaurants that would come to Beechview. 

I remembered a restaurant in Downtown Pittsburgh, one I visited between 3 and 4 years ago that had a magnificent menu and whose couriers seemingly knew no bounds. I nervously made the call, asked, and waited for 30 seconds that felt like 30 hours. 

\"Yes. We can come to Beechview.\"

As I discussed in my previous review, Ephesus has a prolific bill of fare that includes Turkish and Greek specialties in addition to the typical Italian and American items one would expect to find. 

Craving something offbeat, I decided to go for the Pide Deluxe, a Turkish pie featuring that same crispy (fried?) pita-ish crust and the trio of cheeses I relished on that blustery November day. Topping this exotic cruiser of a pizza was Soujcuk, a Turkish pepperoni, a beef salami, tomatoes, green peppers, grilled hot peppers, and mushrooms. 

The pizza itself was served in a manner that was almost deconstructed, coming to our house in a container in what appeared to be New York-style sidewalk slices, yet the pie would be collapsible still, cut in such a way that the crust pulled away in strips. The pepperoni was pungent, its aridity countered by the juicy tomatoes and oily salami. The hot peppers and green peppers nearly cancelled each other out, the mushrooms stepping in to make a case for fungi to be as mightily meaty as steak. 

Kay chose the Moroccan Spiced Chicken and Dry Plum pizza which showcased toppings that appeared to be less random and more deliberate in their layering. The plump chicken was complimented by both the natural sugars of the plum and the sun-dried tomatoes, As the mozzarella/provolone mix cut the spiciness down a notch, gorgonzola turned the brackish volume knob to 6 o' clock. Roasted almonds added textural heft while a bed of fresh spinach made the affair somewhat healthful, lessening the guilt. 

The falafel was dangerously close to being overdone, but those chickpea patties would not allow a few too many seconds in the deep-fryer to deny them their glory, particularly when they were imbibed with onion, garlic, and parsley.

Dessert for me were the Apple Bites, tiny parcels of apple pie filling that were dusted with cinnamon and were somehow held together by the daintiest of crusts. 

Kay wanted the Rice Pudding, but since Ephesus was out of it for the evening, she settled on those fabulous Cinnamon Sticks, and after having a couple, it was evident that they remain the best I've indulged on to date. 

We were told that delivery would take an hour, but our food arrived in half the time and lost none of its warmth in transit. 

With such a broad menu, delivery range, and hours of operation, Ephesus Pizza is not just a neighborhood pizza joint; they are a cosmopolitan restaurant that efficiently services a metropolitan area and does it proud. Visitors stuck in a local hotel would do well to place an order tonight."}
{"text":"Stopped in to get a gyro.  Friendly service and somehow related to the location on 4th downtown.  The menu has some variety from Wraps & Gyro's to Pide (Turkish Pizza) to kebaps, to regular pizza, salads and wings.  

My gyro was good.  The fries were pretty good too.  Will have to stop back and try a Pide.  The person next to us had a Pide and said it was his favorite thing on the menu."}
{"text":"This place used to be awesome. I don't know if they're under new management lately or what, but the last couple experiences were not good. Their regular pizza tastes like bad grade school cafeteria pizza. Their white pizza is soggy, greasy, undercooked and the veggies are wilted, sloppy and pathetic, nowhere near as fresh as they once were. The time I got chicken carbonara, it tasted like someone poured hot 2% milk over noodles- runny and flavorless. The only thing that saves this place are their breakfast pizzas. They are pretty sweet. But considering the last 3+ times I've ordered, the wait has been over an hour and a half, not even breakfast pizza will bring me back. Oh, and their one delivery guy is SUPER creepy to girls with tattoos."}
{"text":"OMG amazing pizza! I had the Lamb Kebob small and am blown away!  I can't believe I hadn't bound this hidden treasure sooner!"}
{"text":"Terrible.  You're better off picking up a frozen pie from your local grocery store.  I can't wait for Aladdins to open a downtown location."}
{"text":"Although it's called \"Mediterranean,\" and there is indeed falafel on the menu (if you can find it), Ephesus clearly specializes in pizza. And, apparently, delivery. I walked in, and I think it took three minutes of confused questioning on both my part and the cashier's to communicate that I was placing an order, not picking one up. It also could have been my imagination, but I think I got a quizzical look for getting something other than pizza. It's not an attractive place to hang out, so it's no wonder delivery is their thing.

I got a falafel wrap with a side of fries. The veggies on the wrap were lackluster, though the falafel and pita were acceptable. I was given a little cup of some kind of sauce, but what I really would have liked on it was hummus. I wouldn't be surprised if they'd provide it if asked, but it's not there by default.

It was all kind of meh to me. I'll give the benefit of the doubt and suppose their pizza is better, but if \"Mediterranean Kitchen\" makes up two-thirds of the name, you expect the falafel to be more than just acceptable."}
{"text":"Emphasis never disappoints the pizza is always fresh and cheesy. They're quick and efficient so you never wait more than 15/20 min for food when doing pick up. Huge fan of the specialty pizzas which are always packed with delicious fresh ingredients. 
Most recently I got a large Hesse pizza and Italian hoagie. Both were delicious- pizza was cheesy with just the right amount of sauce and the hoagie was toasted but not so much so that your couldn't enjoy the contents"}
{"text":"The pizza is healthier than usual pizza. The one we got wasn't really greasy but the pizza itself was ridiculously thin and all of the toppings fell right off. Personally if I'm going to get pizza I'm going to go to papa johns. I prefer toppings to stay on it"}
{"text":"The other reviews are spot on about the ambiance.  It's very frat house chic, with lots of crappy fourth hand furniture, flickering fluorescent lights and turkish news playing on the the big screen TV (WTF?) 

It is a bitch to find, especially at night, so pack your gps.  Once you find the building, you have to punch in the code ( It was 0002 when I went) for the door to get into the lobby at least at night.  Once you're in the lobby, you have to go to the elevator and hit \"M\"  for mezzanine level.  There was no sign telling us to do that and the elevator wouldn't let us select any other floor without a security badge, so it took us a little while to figure out.  Once we stepped off the elevator, my friend was having serious second thoughts about the place because of the sketchy vibe, but I'm glad we stayed because the food was REALLY REALLY good.  

I got a meat lovers pizza that was absolutely piled with pepperoni, sausage, ham,  and bacon.  It was really tasty.  My friend got the Lamb Shish Kabob which had some sort of magical spices on it.  It was like a circus in your mouth.  It also came with some kind of flat bread with sesame seeds which was really good.  

The location (second floor, over the river and through the woods)  and the atmosphere absolutely suck, but the food definitely didn't disappoint. I knocked off 1 star for sketchiness, but the place redeemed itself when our order came out.  If this place found a  little nicer location on street level, it would own."}
{"text":"I do not know which is worse, the delivery, the cold food, or the lack of customer service. Lost the business of a customer who has given  $300 of business in a day with a who cares attitude. This place sucks!"}
{"text":"90 minutes for two cold pizzas.....sorry at this point even a two star review is generous.

While in town with friends, we wanted an easy meal after running the half marathon earlier in the day.  Consulting Yelp, I saw that this place had good reviews, they delivered and since we were less than a mile from them, we figured we'd have the food fairly fast (there were two hungry toddlers and five hungry adults, and we needed food, stat!)

Upon calling, we first asked if they delivered to hotels just to be sure.  If they didn't, that would be fine we'd call someplace else.  So we ordered our two pizzas and gave them the name and address of the hotel. It is a newish hotel, so I told my buddy to tell them \"It's right by the Consol Energy Center, where the Penguins play\".  I figured that even if they didn't know the hotel or the address, most people in Pittsburgh would know where the Penguins play.  We were concerned when we had to say the name of the hotel four times and as it turned out, we were right to be concerned.

After an hour with no pizzas, we call and they guy says \"Oh, the delivery guy is on your street right now.  Should be 2 minutes\".  20 minutes later the delivery guy calls and says he's on his way.  We ask if he knows where he's going and he says yes.  10 minutes later he calls again and asks where we are.  When we finally got the pizza, it was not hot.  The cheese had congealed everywhere and it looked like it had been cut by a toddler.  There were so big slices, some little slices...just not the usual uniform slices.

I felt bad for the guy because he said his GPS had been stolen that morning, but we tried everything to make sure that the place new we were at the hotel right beside the arena and it still failed.  

Better luck next time."}
{"text":"This pizza is BY FAR the best pizza in Pittsburgh. Yes, I said it. Over Fiori's. Over Beto's. Over Stone. I could go on....

We order from here at work frequently and have never been disappointed with the food. The pizza is the perfect amount of dough-y and cheesy and cooked to delightfulness. I would love to try some of their other national dishes on the menu. The only thing that could definitely change is notifying customers of when their order will be late. Twice so far I haven't been notified when the delivery time is over 45 minutes. Hungry workers would at least like a heads up!"}
{"text":"Difficult to find...take the elevator up to the M level.  
No decor inside...feels like an old cafeteria, and the location sucks, but the food is really good...it would do amazingly well in a better location.
I went for a workday lunch; very good menu and my friend raved about their Turkish pizza.  I'd recommend ordering online/ordering before you go, or else you might wait a little while.  I got their grilled chicken salad and the chicken they had on it was some of the best I've had downtown."}
{"text":"This is the cheesiest,most delicious, gooey wonderful pizza I've had in a long time. After trying all the pizza joints A-wall has to offer, I think I have found my go-to. We also got some expertly-done wings. Not dry, not soggy, just enough crispyness. 

Their menu also includes some really delicious-looking specialty pizzas I can't wait to try."}
{"text":"Ephesus is special.  Fast friendly service.  Surprisingly comfy and stylish seating and lighting for a primarily take out shop.  A broad, customizable menu with a solid mix of Italian and Greek deliciousness.  Low prices, massive portions, and better prepared, home made, flavorful food than they have any right to offer at the prices they charge.  

Ephesus is not a 5 star culinary experience, but for the casual fare and reasonable rates they offer, I can't imagine a better choice.  Well done Ephesus, you set the bar for all other local delivery spots to try to live up to!"}
{"text":"Is sad because the pizza is great but the service is horrible! We place an order at 10:17 am for 2 extra large pizzas and 2 small. The girl said about 45 min to an 1 hr, great perfect timing in order to feed my staff at lunch when the girl repeated the phone number back I realized that this was the general number and asked if she could take my direct dial that way they would actually reach someone when the called to notify me that the delivery was in the lobby she repeated it back and I thought all was well. I called back at 12:29 and asked if my order had left yet and all I was asked was what was the address, ah hello we're in downtown and did you ever think there might be more than one order coming in from the same office bldg... A 3rd phone call was made closer to 1 pm to ask what was the hold up, only to find out that my order was attempted to be delivered around 11:30 am but they couldn't reach anyone so they left when asked what number they were trying they said the general number, yes the same number I advised the girl taking the order that she wouldn't reach anyone at. The manager offered to remake the order since it had been sitting and offered a $5 discount on my next order, wow thanks! So after about 30 minutes the order still wasn't here so we called yet again only to be told we're trying to call but no one is answering and that the driver was in the lobby. Needless to say they had all the right numbers but not in the correct order. Not only did we give them a direct dial at the beginning of the order,after all the confusion and speaking with the manager we then gave a cell number just to be sure the call wouldn't be missed. It seems the staff at Ephesus needs to take an effective listening class, maybe it'll help. When we told them this was the worst service we've ever received and that we would not be ordering again the simple response was \"ok\""}
{"text":"crooks they overcharge you on grubhub with increase price. stay away don't try these crooks. food is terrible so is customer service. there are better restaurants in pittsburgh. this is piss poor excuse for a turkish restaurant."}

{"text":"Greasy, bland and lacking flavor.  I have ordered some dishes here that tasted awful while others were your typical food at a dive pizza place.  Think frozen then deep-fried, canned sauce with no spices, frozen pierogies from Restaurant Depot swimming in fake butter sauce etc."}
