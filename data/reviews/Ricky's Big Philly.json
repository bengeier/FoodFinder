{"text":"Drove by Saturday 4-3.   PERMANENTLY CLOSED :(  Sad day."}
{"text":"I love Ricky's Big Philly, but sometimes I see that they are close. Maybe it's the summer hours. I especially love the Tuna sandwiches. Yum!"}
{"text":"After driving by this place countless times, I finally stopped by today. I eat cheesesteaks maybe twice a year, but I do enjoy a good one.

Well, Ricky's delivers a delicious cheesesteak. In fact, If I were using Corleone's as a competitor, Ricky's would leave them in the dust. The meat is good, and they don't overdo it on the cheese. The highlight, however, is the bread - the best cheesteak bread I've had in the Valley. It's not too soft, and not too hard - it's just right and gave me enough of a grip to make this one of the cleanest-eating cheesesteaks I've ever had."}
{"text":"I had the best of the best burger in the state few years ago at Ricky's Big Philly.  So sad Ricky is closed.  If anyone know if Ricky's got relocated somewhere in town, please let all its fans know.  I miss the Ricky's burger so much, so tasteful, so juicy, smokey, full of favor, it is a life changing moment.  Since it is closed, I tried many burger in many different place and restaurant, no place near Ricky's level.  Even now, I am still sharing my experience at Ricky to my friends.  It is the urban legend!"}
{"text":"The food here is not mediocre, the cheesesteaks are some of the best I ever tasted.  The onion rings and fries are fried perfectly golden, they are not grease laden but crisp hot and huge.  Ricky's is not a chain, it does not sit in a sanitized strip mall like Chipotle so it might not be for everyone.  I thought that Ricky's was clean, the food was great and the service was quick and friendly.  I ran over there one weekday on my lunch break from midtown,  went to the drive-trhough and couldn't believe how fast they served me, four minutes at most.  Credit and debit cards accepted and you might want to call ahead to be sure they are open, I know they close early on Saturday."}
{"text":"Here is the thing, the food was mediocre at best. The meat in the cheese steak was to thick and over done along with the mushrooms and onions. I kind of felt like I was eating dog food or a really bad Italian beef. The only good part were the fries and they were just OK. If you want a good cheese steak I suggest you go to Casella's in Scottsdale. I wish I had."}
{"text":"I recently visited with my Italian friend, Joe. So when he said that the chicken parm sandwich was as good as anything he's had- particularly the sauce-, that carries weight.  We also sampled the burger and cheesesteak, both great.  

Now if they could just work on creating some ambiance.  The place is barren and has the charm of a janitors closet.  But don't let that dissuade you.  The food is splendid, a great lunch option."}
{"text":"Sad day. The place is now permanently closed."}
{"text":"I miss this place. They always had great cheesesteaks. It was replaced by Paul's little Philly for a while, then some kind of coffee shop. Now it is The Stand, a great burger spot, but nothing will replace Ricky's."}
