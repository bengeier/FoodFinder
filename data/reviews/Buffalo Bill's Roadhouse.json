{"text":"Good place, nice menu.  I have eaten in and done takeout and never had anything bad.  I marked them down a star for price.  In this area, the prices are a tad high.  Not terrible by any means, but higher than most places in the valley.  The wings are pretty unique, being baked rather than fried.  They therefore have some char on them, so if that offends you go elsewhere.  It's good for you!  Also, they serve regular \"chicken wings\" not the jumbo whole wings that are common elsewhere here in the AK valley, so take that into consideration."}
{"text":"I can't deny the wings were some of the best I've ever had HOWEVER....the service was terrible. There was five of us in a group and we Sat down and there was one other table in the place and it was two guys already eating so we sit down wait over 10 mins for the waitress to even come over to the table because she was laughing with the other employees behind the bar. Then we order or food and drinks the drinks come and she sets all of them down in front of one person at my table and tells my friend to pass them out....the food she gave to us individually but everyone got there food but me for about 10 mins I Sat and watched all of my friends eat there food while I watched our waitress standing behind the bar holding my dinner and laughing it up with the other employees not really caring about here customers I finally get my food and after we all finish our meals all of our plates and glasses are empty and she continuously walks by the table time after time not even paying attention to her biggest table after another 10 mins of this she finally brings the checks and I figure thank God the nightmare is over...wrong..she came over with this giant slip of paper and says all on one? We all said no all separate so she hands this big slip to my friend and says tear your order off and pass it down I'll meet you at the counter when your ready to pay please leave all CASH tips on the table very ignorant and very rude so if I were to eat there again it would be take out"}
{"text":"Great wings! The sauces and dusts are incredible! Seriously! That being said, the staff is rude and obnoxious and everything on the menu is overpriced.  I love their wings and hardly ever have an issue with them but they don't come cheap! Which is a shame. Also, the staff is too busy talking to each other to help a customer. Not cool. When the restaurant is busy and there are lots of orders to fill then I get it, you have a ton to do and we have to wait our turn. But when it's dead and you feel like just ignoring customers cause you're lazy, then we have a problem. Just get take out. So much easier than dealing with the servers. The hoagies are good, so are the fried foods with the exception of their French fries which tend to be soggy and limp. Want delicious wings? Get some here. Anything else? You can find better quality at a better price somewhere close by."}
{"text":"best wings ever. they bake 'em. not only are they unique and tasty they are probably good for you. who knows who cares every now and then you just have to indulge. also, the service is friendly and fast. my favorite is the jamaican."}
{"text":"Awesome Wings!!! This place was introduced to me by a college friend who said we had to check out this place. I am deeply grateful for the experience. Let me tell you a little about the place so you can anticipate the atmosphere and the deliciousness. I would qualify this place as a dive-bar/roadhouse. The inside is one large room with a vast beer cooler (six-packs, bottles etc) and several tables(seating for maybe 30?). There is a small bar area that faces the kitchen. The wings are cooked through the pizza oven (not deep fried) which is absolute heaven when it comes to digestion later in the evening! Dress is casual, come in, grab a seat and order some wings. I have had the 'primanti-style' sandwich and it is very good but HUGE!! This place easily rivals those commercial wing joints (BW3's) and in my opinion surpasses them in quality."}
{"text":"I love the spicy ranch wings extra well done!!  Buffalo bills roadhouse has the best wings I've ever had.  I never get anything else on the menu except for the fries, because the wings are so damn good.  I come on average once a week and service is great!!"}
{"text":"Wings are usually great, occasionally you'll get a batch a little undercooked (chewy).  My only true complain is that they have forgotten items from my take out order on multiple occasions.  If you get take out, check your bags before you leave!!"}
{"text":"Their wings are off the chain.  I mea so so so so good  I am African American and they treated me so nice and polite.   I came there late and called ahead they were very polite."}
{"text":"Okay, it's in a converted gas station and really doesn't have the greatest ambiance,  but it absolutely has the best wings in Westmoreland county. I visited because of yelp reviews and was not disappointed. I had the original hot wings which were great. Their sauce is unique;  it's not just watered down Tabasco. When you are in New Ken you have to stop in."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best wings in the area no doubt.  If you are a wing lover.. I strongly suggest.  Now.. don't be discouraged since they are \"not\" fried.  They are something special.  Cooked similar to wings that \"Anthony's Coal Fire Pizza\" offers but with a variation of sauces available.  The wings were mouthwatering good and unforgettable.  I tried the original hot..  just the right temperature. Yea I like my lips to tingle.. love spicy food.  It wasn't too overpowering just right.    I sampled the Jamaican sauce and it was also full of zing but didn't have the level of heat I desire but still tasty.   The prices are above average.  Theres much more to the menu that I like to explore when I go back.   From the outside the restaurant looks small.. but its bigger than it appears. Inside - 5-6 bar stools and 10 tables and a vast selection of beer.   I highly recommend."}
{"text":"They are OK. I really don't care for wing dings which is what their whole menu consist of.... Soggy greasy home made fries, not really good. Rest of the food is mediocre bar food. I would say if your looking for wings definitely better places in town to find those!"}
{"text":"Ordered buffalo wings to go since everyone said not to eat in. Not too shabby! A mix of BBQ and Buffalo. Nice to have wings that aren't fried. I'd eat here again."}
{"text":"Congratulations Buffalo Bills Roadhouse...I finally found a place that can screw up a simple salad and make me throw away wings.  The salad was wilted and brown. The dressing was the consistency...and flavor of water. The wings must've been the wings of hummingbirds because they were so small and overpriced."}
{"text":"This place is unreal, i can't even expess how killer their wings are words just don't do it justice. Just go and try it out for yourself, you'll want to keep coming back for more. Buffalo Bills needs to be on Food Networks Diners, Drive-ins & Dives with Guy Fieri or the Best Thing I've ever Ate, no joke. My choice is Origional Hot, it's the perfect combination of Spice and Flavor. Trust me check it out, you'll be amazed"}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed with our takeout. These wings were smoked and tasted burnt. Kind of disappointing since all my friends rave about this place."}
{"text":"Buffalo Bill's Roadhouse is a place I totally would have looked over if it weren't for the Yelp app! My fiance' and a friend had been golfing in the New Kensington Area and were looking for a great place to eat. Buffalo Bill's had the most starts so we thought we'd give it a try!   The restaurant definitely has a hometown kind of feel, which was really nice. There were so many things on the menu it was very hard to decide what I wanted. Everyone says you need to get the wings, but they also have a great selection of sandwiches. My fiance' and I decided to get an order of wings and a fried bologna sandwich and share. I'm super glad we did because both were excellent. What's really cool about their wings is that they aren't fried. They are baked and have this excellent flavor you don't get with your typical fried wings. The bologna sandwich (which I'm sure was full of calories :P) was also delicious.   The service is pretty typical for this type of place. They're extremely nice, but not super attentive because they're also making tons of take-out orders.  If you're in the area I definitely recommend Buffalo Bill's!"}
{"text":"Love Buffalo Bill's seasoned wings!  Loved that they are baked and they are delicious!  We frequent the place and found the service to be fine."}
{"text":"The grilled wings here are excellent and the best in town. I also recommend getting a side of fries because it goes together good. Usually I go with the original hot sauce on my wings which is very tasty."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. I know folks that go crazy over their food, especially their wings. I think it's a little too cramped for my likes. When you walk in the counter is right there and the place is usually packed. You kind of have to decide what you want as soon as you get there or before you get there as your space at the counter to order is quickly taken by others so act quickly and swiftly or loose out. I have had sandwiches, sides, drinks, and wings here. All decent and probably worth checking out. Prices are so so."}
{"text":"I'm so conflicted over this place...the prices are ridiculous, they nickle and dime you at every corner (for example - they charge you for the take-out containers if you get your order to-go) the service is non-existent (don't expect a drink refill) the staff is rude and and 95% of the menu sucks.  With that said, they have the best wings and fries that I have ever eaten!  It takes a lot for me to return to a place with bad service - especially more than once - but the wings are that good."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh areas best wings! They broil them, not deep fried. Great flavor choices. Fries are fresh potatoes but a little greasy. Smell of cigars on occasion? Sometimes after work there are a couple of old guys puffing right beside the door. Decent selection of bottled beer."}
{"text":"This is the dirtiest restaurant I have ever had the pleasure of frequenting. The salad is disgusting, the wings, their specialty are burnt and gross, and the cooler they sell beer out of hasn't ever been cleaned, which is also where they keep the wings..."}
{"text":"Every year we go to Pittsburgh and my cousin-in-law Tom brings me out to Buffalo Bills. Its the nicest little place in town, with the greatest chicken wings I've every had. So c'mon in, grab a beer from the fridge, order a bucket or two of wings, then finish up with a nice cigar outside. Yinz won't regret it."}
{"text":"I have visited this place a couple times and haven't been impressed either time. The wings are baked and frequently burnt. The beer selection is very pedestrian and the dining area is rather cramped. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Prior to last Sunday, I hadn't been in BB for quite a while.  Some of my friends decided to take me there for my birthday.  I ordered the five-star hot wings (I forget what the name was, only that they were hotter than the habanero wings)  I can review them with two words: HOLY SHIT!!!  They were the hottest wings I have ever eaten.  My fiancee and I were with another couple, and the lady said to me  that my lips were shaking.  After we finished eating, I went to the mens room to clean up.  My lips were purple!!!  They were nice to try, but a little too hot for my taste :) Reminiscent of what I would have eaten on fear factor had I made the cut."}
{"text":"I travel every week all over the globe and have yet to find a better wing than this place serves!  Order them extra crispy and you won't be disappointed.  I would say there most popular sauce is spicy ranch with original hot being up there.  I always ask them to burn my wings!!  It leaves a char that you cannot get anywhere else.  the one and only buffalo bills roadhouse!"}
{"text":"Good wings, baked in a conveyor pizza oven yet some how has a bit of a smoked flavor to it. Best for take out as ambience is lacking.  They also have a six pack shop so pick up some beer and have some great wings from your couch at home while watching the game.  All the flavors are great but if you get seasoned ask for extra seasoning."}
{"text":"best wings ever. baked in a pizza oven and not deep fried. nice char. great sauces. atmosphere is a little dingy, and the menu has little to nothing to offer outside of wings. but, well worth it if you're in the area and want a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"This is the best you can get for this area.  Fresh cut fries are good.  The ribs were good but fatty.  The wings were broiled not deep fried.  Took long to get our food"}
{"text":"I have a dream, and in my dream, House of 1,000 Beers, which is a stone's throw from here supplies the beer to Buffalo Bill's. Pipeline, Pony Express, weatherproof tunnel, I don't care. They form an unbeatable partnership: the best beer selection and the best wings in Pittsburgh all in one place.  Until that happens, I'll just have to be satisfied with the best wings in Pittsburgh right here. We usually come at lunch - not crowded, and the waitress has time to discuss the pros and cons of various sauces. I haven't run across a bum choice yet (Original Hot, Teriyaki, Jamaican), and broiling makes the wings delicious.  Lots of places serve good wings. These are better than those wings you've had you think are good. And the beer selection Buffalo Bill's is fine; just pretend you don't know about the 1,200 varieties just down the road that might pair well with wings."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for more than 10 years and I LOVE the wings, they are one of the best. Unfortunately, they are the most crazy, overpriced wings you can order with barely any meat on them anymore. It really sucks because they weren't like this up until a few years ago. You can't even get celery and ranch with your order unless you're paying $1.75 or something ridiculous. I really hope you guys see this and step up your game, it's pretty outrageous right now. So for now, patrons do yourself a favor and get wings at a bar's wing night in the area for 3x as much food, and 3x less $."}
{"text":"I have been going here my whole life and up until recently I loved it. The food hasn't changed. It's the prices. The food is way overpriced for what you get. The wings are awesome but the price isn't worth what you get. Is almost ten dollars for a ten piece of half wings. The sandwiches are good and the price is more reasonable."}
{"text":"yeah so the other night I am hankering for some wings and I think to myself where should I go. And then I remembered this great place that I had wings from and it was Buffalo Bills, Roadhouse Grill. I enjoyed their food the first time and I loved it even more this time. I am so glad that I remembered this place and now after reading the menu I intend to try more of their recipies because if the wings are so good then surely the rest of their food must be great too."}
{"text":"I would give it 5 stars but see below...  Wings - THE BEST wings...broiled, not fried!  The fresh cut fries are terrific.  If you want wings...a MUST.  Knocks...for wing and beer lovers, the beer selection stinks (hence the knock).  It serves only US \"Lawnmower\" beers.  A few good upscale beer selections PLEASE."}
{"text":"Most of the bars around this place serve whole wings which is kinda odd and I've found few places where they serve small wings ...but they fry the wings instead of grilling it .. This place serves the grilled small wings and their blazing and original sauce is lip smacking"}
{"text":"Buffalo Bill's has become our go to place for wings.  Tried many of the varieties and all are delicious.  I guess the grilling is the key.  Decided to switch things up and grab an Italian Hoagie.  I liked it.  Not the best I've had, but better than many others.  Although I can't say what would make it better, good ratio on meat to bun and toppings.  Oh yeah, the fresh cut fries are really good as well.  I usually dump the wings on top of the fries or give them the vinegar treatment."}
