{"text":"Gross... Went for lunch at 2pm and it was as if they made the food - no one came - they left it instead of make fresh food... Everything was hard and cold.. The dry robs were completely inedible... They just have you order from the menu if you want fresh.. So instead of paying you're basic 12-16$ for your meal, you have to pay double or triple... I gave no tip and if I wasn't so sick after my \"meal\" I would have made a fuss to have it for free... Most expensive place in town and the nastiest place in town... Go to Airdrie Wok... Its the cheapest and best Chinese in Airdrie"}
{"text":"It's really expensive for Chinese food that's average at best. Save your money, there are better ones around town."}
{"text":"This was our second time here, and it was really good both times. I'd have no problem going back again. The food was excellent, and the buffet had a great variety of dishes (of which I tried most). The cooks were constantly refilling the buffet table, so the food was always fresh. The servers were very attentive, coming by our table often to check on us.  It's a large restaurant, so you aren't sitting right next to another table, but the atmosphere isn't anything to write home about (hence 4 stars). It is clean, and what you'd expect from a Chinese buffet for decor.  The adult price was either $15.95 or $16.95 with 20% off for seniors. I ate my money's worth and went away happy! They were doing a brisk Take-Out service as well."}
{"text":"Waiters are to themselves and will only come to you for water, they are like water ninjas...your cup of water has to be 2/3 full or more to them.  Food is decent, good selection, building is roomy and food is good...don't know why people hate it so much.  I will come back."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 10 stars I would!  I went here with my sister last week for the Chinese food buffet and it was amazing everything tasted great the wonton soup was wonderful ! the ginger beef was perfect ( not chewy and hard like most places) & the sweet and sour chicken balls were  awesome ! I enjoyed it so much that I ordered it for delivery tonight and once again they did not disappoint me! I would recommend star light to everyone !"}
{"text":"Worst Chinese ever. Buffet is gross!!!! If I could give a negative it would be -10."}
