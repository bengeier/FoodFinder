{"text":"Les clients de ce petit boui-boui juste en face de Cao Thang, pour la plupart des jeunes et des étudiants, font la queue devant la porte pour attendre leur sandwich. Se peut-il qu'il soit si bon que ça ?  En un mot, non.  En fait, ils font la queue parce qu'il n'y a aucune place dans la boutique. Il y a peu ou près un demi-mètre entre le comptoir et le mur en face, ce qui fait qu'il est assez impossible de bouger, d'autant plus qu'il faut aller tout au fond pour passer la commande et ensuite revenir pour payer.  Les prix sont corrects (de l'ordre de $3 pour un banh mi si je ne m'abuse pas) et les sandwichs sont faits sur commande. En revanche les ingrédients sont horribles. Plutôt que du porc à la vapeur, ils y mettent une sorte de charcuterie visqueux et étalent partout un beurre-mayonnaise à l'ail qui écrase les autres goûts. Ils sont radins avec le reste ; je crois avoir compté quatre morceaux de carottes dans mon sandwich. Le pire de tous est le pain. Totalement desséché, il part en miettes avec chaque bouchée et on en perd autant qu'on en mange.  Un désastre absolu. Crevez de faim plutôt que d'y aller."}
{"text":"Excited and anxious to get a taste of a Banh Mi French-Canadian Asian style, I was led to Hoang Oanh Sandwich.  An older Asian local suggested I try it, but didn't know the store by name, and I'm really hoping that I misunderstood her directions because their Banh Mi is a big Banh NO.  I'm not the slightest bit snobby, but I must say that I deserve a sandwich better than the pre-made and packaged one that Hoang Oanh offers. I ordered the traditional ham variety, and the bread is chewy and difficult to get a clean bite. On top of that, the meat / veggie portions couldn't satisfy a squirrel who ventured from the trails of Mont Royal Park to Chinatown for some Yellow fever. You kiddin' me?  I don't like that shit (courtesy of 'Belly')   FYI: This review is soley based on the sandwich portion of the store, other items are offered within that don't pertain to this.  P.S. I hope homeboy below  (Bailey Z) is not including New York and Boston as a black hole for quality Banh Mi. Not the case, Broham. I'll even agree to a taste test challenge on that ass. 617 is where it's at.    *Beantowns Finest*"}
{"text":"It's funny reading the prior reviews.  Maybe the shop has changed, but I absolutely loved the sandwiches here.  Expectations should be tempered:  - It's noisy, cramped, and a lot of things are going on at the same time. - It's definitely easier to order if you speak Vietnamese.  You can pick and choose what you want in your sandwiches.   - Prices ($3-4) are typical, if a little on the expensive side.  The bread is especially great here.  It's crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside.  It's also a good ratio of bread to filling - you don't want too much.  The meats are tasty, the pickled vegetables are good, and chilies (interestingly not jalapenos) give a good surprise kick every few bites.  I destroyed these sandwiches one by one walking around.  It's also buy 10, get 1 free, and trust me, it only seems ridiculous to get that many sandwiches until you try them."}
{"text":"Best sandwiches in Montreal. Great price. Grab a couple."}
{"text":"At $2.75 it just can't be beat. I take the pork there, or the chicken.   One major flaw is they're kind of skimpy on the portions. I mean, really?   They should put more coriander, more pickled veggies, even the spicy one had one or two bites of spicy pepper but that was it.  It is not as full as the Banh Mi shop (Cao Thang) across the street, but it tastes a hell of a lot better than that crap.  The one across the street is run by a non-Vietnamese it seems, and while he packs a sandwich full of stuff, the flavour is a hit and miss. I loved it one day, HATED it the next time I tried.   At least this one is consistent, although not the best I've ever had. I'm a fan based on the lack of choice in Montreal."}
{"text":"So maybe I've been spoiled in authentic Vietnamese restaurants in USA--- I liked the pickled items but they left out the jalapeño when we specifically asked for it spicy. The bread was ok too. There is barely any meat on it--that's why so cheap. Sounds like the ones in the USA r more American and big on the meat! Which is good because I didn't want a big meal. Overall ok-- no seats -takeout only"}
{"text":"My mom and I picked up some banh mi here on our last day in Montreal.  We got the special banh mi ($4) which has extra meat.  My mom felt that it was good and comparable to good banh mi in Toronto's Chinatown.  Service was friendly.  This place is legit.  It had a huge selection of Che, Vietnamese desserts.  And it had lots of Vietnamese snacks like Banh Gio, which is a savoury cake stuffed with ground pork and mushrooms, wrapped in banana leaves and then steamed.  They had Banh Khuc too, which is also a savoury cake made of rice and spinach stuffed with ground pork and mung beans and then rolled in glutinous rice.  They even had Com Ruou (fermented rice balls).  I don't know of any place that sells all this stuff in Ottawa!    If you are looking for some authentic Vietnamese eats, check out Hoang Oanh!  The tastes aren't for everyone.  I personally find fermented rice balls weird.  But if you're adventurous, check out the snacks, you might discover something you didn't know you loved ;)"}
{"text":"Average banh mi at this store. They don't toast the banh mi and the meat doesn't look fresh. I had better banh mi from other places."}
{"text":"I was in Montreal and craving bahn mi and saw this place. I got the classic bahn mi and while the flavour is good, the bread is wayyyy too hard. If you had sensitive teeth this bread would probably hurt your teeth, that's how hard it was lol. Nonethless it satisfies my craving and the filling inside was good. The viet coffee here is a bit too strong for my taste, but that's up to personal preference."}
{"text":"One of my fav bahn mi places in Montreal located in the heart of Chinatown. Sandwiches are cheap $4cad and flavorful in decent portions. I usually get the special combo spicy where the assorted cold cut meats are fresh mixed in with their veggies. The bread they use is okay and could be improved.   Given the price and speed of preparation, I like his place and am a frequent visitor.   Note get a loyalty card. Buy 10 sandwiches, get one free.  Hours are 9am to 6:30pm"}
{"text":"The sandwiches are good but quality depends on the time of day that you order.  I got there around 10AM and they already had some vietnamese sandwiches pre-made.  Don't settle for those-- ask for fresh ones to be made!  When the bun sits in the bag too long, it just gets chewy.  If you're not a fan of Pate, then get the special sandwich.  It's loaded with viet deli meat and it's less than $4.  This place is pretty good but I think you gotta order like a local to get better treatment.  Typical Chinatown!"}
{"text":"Banh mi shops are nearly non-existent in the Northeast (especially in Vermont). The only one that I have come across was from an Asian grocery store - the sandwiches were soggy, bland, and stale. But, when you're ethnically isolated and craving a good Vietnamese sandwich, you don't have a choice.   Hoang Oanh is the closest place I've tried that makes an authentic banh mi. Sandwiches are only $2.75, but they are very cheap on their ingredients. Portions of both meat and pickled vegetables are lacking. It doesn't seem like they carry the freshest baguettes either, but at least they were not stale. I savored that familiar pate flavor with every bite. It will probably be a while before I come across another sandwich."}
{"text":"This is a pick-up-a-sandwich-n-go sort of place.  We went here twice during our short stay in the city, the sandwiches are simple and good.  I recommend the classic sandwich with a viet iced coffee AND the shrimp summer rolls(the sauce is delish)."}
{"text":"I went to Hoang Oanh sandwich today and i bought Vietnamese sausage and the service was rude because they don't put the price on it  .It happened to me two times i don't buy their sandwiches anymore because the carrots pickle are so big it's not a traditional way at all i'd rather to buy at marche Hung Phat at Saint-Denis and last time i bought a fermented pork was expired and i didn't notice that until i got home ."}
{"text":"Was roaming around Montreal's chinatown and saw the sign for some banh mi sandwiches so we dropped in to grab a couple of sammies togo to eat on the way back to NJ.  I ordered 2 Vietnamese style sandwiches which had 3 different types of meat, pate, butter, pickled carrots and daikon, cilantro, and chilies.  The sandwiches were pre-made, which I was a little surprised and the bread wasn't toasted. It didn't bother me that they weren't toasted b/c we weren't going to eat them on the same day.   The baguette was shaped differently than most standard banh mi bread, which was long and skinny.  I actually preferred this shape better than the traditional bread shape.  The flavors were on point and I was happy with our purchase.  The flavors of all of the ingredients were perfectly seasoned.  I typically add extra soy sauce to my banh mi and this one did not need it.  I did toast the sandwiches in the oven before we consumed them so that helped w/ the stale bread taste that some yelpers mentioned. At $3.25 per sandwich, that's a good deal.  They also offered other Vietnamese items such as sticky rice and che (pudding desserts), but they did not look appetizing.  Overall, I would come back and grab some sammies if I were to ever visit Montreal again."}
{"text":"Very good banh mi. I had the pork version. Also tried the banana tapioca dessert and liked that too. Worth a visit if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I havent read any of the reviews here, but I still felt they skimped on all the ingredients. The marketplace near hoang oanh gives better sandwiches.  And ya, even with the buy 9 get 10th free card, its not worth it."}
{"text":"I love Bahn Mi sandwiches and Hoang Oanh are the real deal! The locals come here for a quick sandwich which is a great sign. I went with their chicken bahn mi and it hit the spot. It was delicious with fresh tasty ingredients and the bread was perfect!  Price-tag is very accommodating and it's great if you're on a budget. Staff is nice however they seemed disorganized, we ordered 4 sandwiches and they had a real problem tracking who ordered what.  Cash ONLY."}
{"text":"By only learning about this place now, I feel as though I've wasted the past 10 years of Montreal sandwich eating. I mean, it's not the most incredible thing I've ever ingested, but damned if it doesn't hit the spot.   If you're looking for recommendations, nothing hits the spot like the pork sandwich. I hear chicken is pretty great too."}
{"text":"Quick service. Large selection of Vietnamese sandwiches (banh mi) and other snacks. All of their banh mi's are good, though I always go for their classic one. It's very tasty, though their Vietnamese pickled carrots and daikon radish (do chua) are cut almost like batonnets rather than julienne (so they're less juicy). Good place for lunch!"}
{"text":"The classic sandwich is a good value for money. It is very simple and taste really like Asian food. They have fidelity card. 10 sandwich bought, the 11th for free !  Don't try the other things. You will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Very tasty.  They indeed have the pate on the special sub which is not a surprise.  The bread is a little harder than most subs.  I appreciate the bag that it comes in and the colour coded tape they use to distinguish between the varieties.  It would be better if the carrots were shredded in my opinion.  Overall, great sub: two specials for $9"}
{"text":"Better than expected.  Banh Mi Dac Biet or Banh Mi Hoang Oanh.  $3.25 each.  Little meat and skinny baquettes, but it tasted pretty good.  The thai bird chili slices they used in the sandwiches are a bit more spicy than the jalapeños I'm used to in the states.  This is a carry out only place, no sitting area.  They also have a variety of vietnamese snacks and desserts."}
{"text":"Whenever i am in chinatown, like today, i would stop by this place. By far one of the best places for vietnamese sandwiches. Made to order, the sandwiches are fresh and are of very generous portions for the price. You also have other vietnamese dishes such as paté chaud, bao, xoi kuch, sauted egg noodles and a variety of vietnamese desserts.   I've tried it all but i usually go for the classic special (the classic with more ham and pickled vegetables) and the minced chicken. Along with it, i get the xoi khuc and a vietnamese iced coffee. The coffee here is perfect! Strong coffee flavour with just the right amount of condensed milk sweetness! Oh heaven!!! The service is fast and courteous and again, the prices are fairly cheap. You can eat very well for under 10$! Okay... My order's ready. Yum!!!"}
{"text":"Possibly one of the first banh mi spots in Montreal. I've been going there with my family since I was a little boy. Amazing sandwiches, no frills. You have to try the pâté chaud, always a great flakey porc treat. Tons of other authentic vietnamese goods."}
