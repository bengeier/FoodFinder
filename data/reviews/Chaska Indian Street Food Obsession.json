{"text":"Had a great meal here. Lamb kebob was fresh,  tasty and tender; wrapped in the supplest paratha this side of the Atlantic. Service with a smile, Naveen (the owner) came out to say hi and check up on our experience. Would definitely come back and consider catering from here in the future...I'm so fat..."}
{"text":"Simply loved this place. We ordered chicken tikka, paneer tikka, bhalla chat and almond milk. The place was not crowded, decor is simple. Food was delicious, will definitely go back.   Our only feedback, to extend on weekends till 11-12 at night for late bites."}
{"text":"The food was amazing.  The portion for the rice bowl was huge. I had the chicken Tikka with vindaloo. Pretty spicy. Lots of flavor. I must say the decor for Chaska is pretty cool. Even the music they played was good."}
{"text":"Love the new concept restaurant. All the aet work and the decor is amazing! They even carried on the art work into the washrooms The menu is simple and not over complicated! Love the rice bowl options. for a change you just have to order one dish at an Indian restaurant for a whole meal"}
{"text":"Food is good... Pricey but still good..we got the mutton and chicken tikka.. Both were flavorful and fresh.... But quantity was less for the price.."}
{"text":"Good, limited but unique food items. Good service. Taste buds satisfied.  Will definitely visit again..."}
{"text":"Ordered a paneer tikka kathi roll and samosa chaat side. The roll was pretty tasty, I enjoyed eating that it had good flavours and plenty of paneer. Wasn't so keen on the chaat. Quite reasonably priced too.  The decor is pretty cool.   They only had one person making the rolls in the kitchen so the service is a bit on the slow side."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing place. From the minute you walk in, the smells and decoration take you right back to India ( in a positive way lol ). Had the kathi rolls there, very tasty and as authentic as I've seen anywhere in Canada.  Great music, great decor, yum food!"}
{"text":"Great place! They have created a great ambiance, a lot of though gone behind it. Having tea in those small cups reminded me of college days. Food is great. Worth visiting the place."}
{"text":"The ambience of this restaurant is on point..the food not so much!  I ordered the chicken tikka with salad andmy friend got the goat kabab(forget what its called exactly) with rice. The salad is basically kept in the fridge and they just mix in your choice of toppings. Honestly, that blend did not taste good. There was only 8 small pieces of chicken in my salad and for 12$ it felt like a rip off. However, The rice bowl was good and the meat was soft and tasted fresh.  We also ordered the mango lassi and rose lassi. Mango was good, rose was alright. The best part would be the kulfi, thats the only thing that felt like authentic indian street food. I have mixed feelings about this place but I dont think we will be visiting again!"}
{"text":"In one word: WOW!! And that applies all the way from the ambience, service, food and overall experience!!"}
{"text":"Very tasty. High quality for fast food. Nice sitting. Slightly on the expensive side for fast food but good for the quality offered. Medium spicy is plenty spicy for me. Definitely on my favorite list"}
{"text":"Really great food. Just wish the rice was still warm and that the portions were bigger."}
{"text":"This is an awsmm place.Fresh food nice variety and taste took me back to india.Im a big time chai lover and their chai(Tea) is perfect for my north indian pahadi taste buds. Very cool interiors.Good menu."}
{"text":"We had an excellent early evening meal here. The Mint Chicken Kathi Roll was really delicious! Also enjoyed the Samosa Chaat. Highly recommend the Panna Mango juice to wash everything down."}
{"text":"First time trying Indian street food!! I had pondered the menu for a while, very confused by what all the words meant. Ultimately, with the help of my Indian friends and trusted Google, I settled on ordering channa chawal, and paid an additional $2 for chai. Meanwhile, my friend ordered pav bhaji, with a side of samosa chaat and chai.   The entire restaurant is very well designed! The order and pickup counter resembles the front of a food truck, and the restaurant interior screams food truck.  When we picked up our orders, I was astonished by the difference in size between my friend's and my orders. Mine was quite large and hearty, but, as can be seen from the photos, my friend's was tiny!  The channa chawal was quite delicious, and not too heavy. The curry was rich, and there was so much rice that I couldn't finish it (packed almost half of it to go - that being said, I am a small eater). Unfortunately, the fried bits got soggy while I was waiting for my friend to get her food, so they didn't taste that good.   My friend's pav was really good, albeit thick. I loved that it was quite tangy and tomato-ey. Her two bread rolls came generously buttered - to the point that it masked the flavour of the pav when I tried it, giving me the excuse to try more. ;)  The chai was tiny, but if you're sitting in the restaurant, they offer free refills (I got two refills!). I asked what was in it, and one of the workers hilariously became all secretive and refused to disclose any details, haha!  The service was also impeccable. While sitting, we were asked if we required anything more. Upon leaving, we were also asked if we enjoyed our experience and told to return if possible! Overall, a very comfortable and relaxing setting, although the music can get quite loud and limit conversation."}
{"text":"Great ambience, service and food. Unique representation. The portions may be small but overall great. Also, they make BOMB savian"}
{"text":"They just dont know how to cook their meats. (Chicken tikka, mutton seekh kabab, fish tikka). Though the meats are good quality, but pepper poweder on top of grilled Indian meats?? Rest everything is impeccable and clean.  Those are pretty std. recipes and should get them right, with a chef 101. Trust me, you'll get a Michelin Star once you get that right."}
{"text":"Initially saw the sign while driving home on Matheson after work and it intrigued me. Finally made the trip and it was so damn good, I had to write up a review.   I had the Chicken Tikka Kathi Roti and it was the perfect blend of spices, onion, chutney and chicken, all wrapped in a soft, paratha type bread. I've been to most of the new afghan chains popping up like weeds all over Toronto and Mississauga (think Bamiyan Kabob, Watan Kabob etc.) and although their meat is top notch, they tend to use generic pre-mixed toppings (lettuce, etc.) instead of providing a more authentic experience.   Prices are a bit steeper (9 incl. tax for the abovementioned roll) but totally worth it for the significantly upgraded vibes, food quality and service. Plus, they have specials on Mondays' and Tuesdays where you can get 2 veg rolls for 10 bucks+tax. Not a bad deal at all. Def coming back!"}
{"text":"Welcome to little India. Painless ordering system. Clear menu on colourful monitors. Lots of gluten free and vegetarian options. Reasonable prices and hearty servings. Flavour country. Good variety. Wholesome and quality ingredients. Clean meat products. Authentic energy with a great sound system. Friendly staff. Clean washrooms. Great paint job. Decent parking. Easy to find and good location. Draft prevention technology kept breeze out. Quick service. Spacious dining area with plenty of seating. Josh is too full to care. See you next rain day."}
{"text":"Places like Chaska make me want to move to Canada - just for the food. Absolutely loved the ambiance and d√©cor; that resembled a food truck, an Indian dhaba, thela as well as had the comfort and panash of a sit down restaurant. A small menu, but they knew what they were doing. We ordered the Chana Chawal, Paneer tikka and Mushroom kathi rolls. The dishes were not super complex, but the attention to recipe, perfect amount of tandoor grilling and the right amount of spices made them absolutely divine. The paneer tikka and mushrooms were grilled to perfection, & had that smoky flavor. The roti was soft and well balanced with the egg. Chana Chawal had the aroma of hing, saunf, jeera and was beautifully served with papad and salad. Even the chutneys were authentic and aromatic. In the end, we topped the meal with a pan flavored kulfi - which was probably the best pan kulfi I have ever had. Umami all around - Chaska is here to stay and will go a long way. Kudos to the chef and owners."}
{"text":"Awesome food, authentic ambience and friendly service! The kathi roll brought back memories of Mumbai Frankie! Shout out to dear friend Parveen Dhupar and Team BTI Brand Innovations for the awesome branding and design of the restaurant!!"}
{"text":"The wraps n cutting chai were amazing... loved the look of the place and everything on the menu looked delicious. The samosa pav was great too!!"}
{"text":"Great food and very attentive service.   Today we were not thrilled with the papdi chaat and gave feedback and within minutes we have another portion to sample.   The Kathi rolls are amazing. Ask for the bread to be crisp.  Our 2nd time here and it has never been very crowded. Hope they stay in business. It would be a pity if they don't"}
{"text":"This place is horrible!!!  I mean ok the paneer was cooked nicely... i bought mint paneer but they literally just took paneer, added mint sauce... and a bunch of spicy vindaloo sauce.... its not even cooked properly together...  NOT IMPRESSED AT ALL!!!   I'm glad i didnt try the drinks there...  Another co worker of mine tried it and he said the same thing...   Not going back.... dont waste your money   Definitely not Chaska"}
{"text":"Yes it's great! We tried many things... Paneer Tikka, Bhel chaat tossed, Pav Bhaaji, Samosa Sliders and Cutting Chai. Everything was really good except Samosa Sliders... imli chutney was taking all the flavors of Samosa and I was not able to enjoy Samosa so at the end we had to leave because chutney was too much. I liked the fact that we can refill our cutting chai glass for free! Bhel chaat was awesome!"}
{"text":"Best of the best.....loved this place. Delicious food with mouth watering flavours of India. First time had kathi roll so good. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Great food, freshly prepared.  I love this place, I come here often.   The kathi rolls are fantastic.    To be honest I prefer these over the rice bowls.    Favourite dishes are chicken tikka kathi roll and paneer kathi roll.  Music and atmosphere is also great, and makes you feel that you are not in the middle of a corporate park in the middle of Mississauga.  My only reservation is that it can sometimes take quite a while for the food to be served especially on busy days.  If you are in a rush, I wouldn't recommend going there if the lineup is more than 6 people.     It could take you 20+ minutes to get your food."}
{"text":"I wanted real authentic Indian food.  So I decided to try this place.  I ordered butter chicken and brown rice. It was mushy and it felt like I was eating a bowl of chilli.  Taste was just ok."}
{"text":"My first visit to this restaurant and I loved the whole experience. I wanted to order everything from the meu but was limited to the money I was carrying. I loved the menu, food and service. Will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place, cute decor and great service and fantastic food! I had a kathi roll and chaat which were both delicious! Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Great food and healthy without sacrificing taste. Couple recommendations to make the experience better: tone down the music - way too loud for a lunch experience, do something about preventing cold air getting in on a windy day - had to keep my jacket on the whole time, redesign the trash cans so they can accept the large salad bowls easily and include a recycle option.  All in all a great new variant on Indian to counter the tired versions thus far."}
{"text":"Good Food, GTA's answer to NYC's Indi kitch. Indian food meant for quick bite or grab and go primarily to cater for the surrounding office population. Me and My wife enjoyed the desi urban style ambience and the food was good. Would love to see some more options though, if not on lunch then atleast on the dinner menu."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place out after finishing a round of 9 hole nearby. Came in the last hour before closing so it wasn't busy but still smelled delicious upon entry.   I love the decor and fun ordering counter. I got the soy kebab kathi roll, they ran out of soy tikka!  The spice I asked for on the side really helped but the flavor of the roll was great. Simple but strong, ate left overs the next day and it was still good.   Thought the bread was a little thick but still flaky and delicious.   The samosa chat was good, except just slightly too sweet for me.   My friends tried the bowl and samosa sliders. Both liked but didn't finish their portions and had leftovers.   Will come back again if I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Love this place. While a bit of a drive away, the food was delicious and the service was great. Also they serve cutting chai. The surprise was that chai had with unlimited refills!!! :)"}
{"text":"Amazing! The restaurant is so cool, and the food is so authentic. I had the kathi roll with lamb tikka. It was soooo tasty! Highly recommend coming. We shared a yogurt type chaat as well, it was so good and they even put pomegranate on top! Delicious!"}
{"text":"Great food. Loved the grilled chicken. The flavors are nice. Limited options for the real street food though. But would highly recommend."}
{"text":"$24 for very small roll, rice bowl and mango.  Hungry 2 hrs later.  Way over priced. Minimal amount of meat.  Nice interior, friendly staff. Wouldn't return at these prices."}
{"text":"Got the salad bowl with chicken tikka. The chicken was pretty dry. Nothing great!  Rose lassi was very sweet and the yoghurt was very thin. Lassi isn't supposed to so watery. Not impressed.  Great decor and fancy marketing! Food was just OK!"}
{"text":"Very tasty authentic Indian food, anything from Chai to Lassi or Pao Bhaji. Would definitely recommend it. Staff is very helpful and caters to your needs promptly. I am a vegetarian, so lot of options to choose from - be it snacks or lunch. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Thank God! This place is close to my office! The food is phenomenal as if Heaven Comes to Earth!. Their drinks are also fantastic! All the items are  fresh and healthy. Their spice combination could be their secret, I don't know yet. My fav so far Khalit Wrap with Salmon, Samosa Chaat and Badam Milk. Starting from the Owner- Naveen and the General Manager, all the staff is positive, friendly, and  professional working for your cravings;)"}
{"text":"One of my favourite lunch spots in the area due to the following: Love their food. It always tastes fresh. Very cool ambience. Very easy to order and pay online. You get notifications when order is placed and when it's ready. Food pickup process is quick and easy."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, friendly staff, and good food.   We came here on a Saturday night, with a group of 4.  First we ordered the 1.99 chai which was bottomless & delicious! One of the employees was so friendly and came to give us refills about 5 times and we definitely appreciated it.   We tried the Paneer Kathi Rolls & the Rice Bowl. Both were delicious! I would definitely recommend the chicken tikka rice bowl with Vindaloo Curry, it was so spicy but so tasty!"}
{"text":"I've driven past this place on my way to and from work and knew I had to try it when I saw it had just opened.  The food itself was delicious, ambience was on point, and staff were very friendly.  I ordered the Rice Bowl with Chicken Tikka in Vindaloo Curry, and that was amazing. Wouldn't consider it street food, but was delicious nonetheless. The chicken tikka was grilled to perfection and had just the right amount of seasoning and masala. The Vindaloo could have been spicier, but from the looks of it, they seem to cater very much to the working crowd in this area. The bowls also come with a quarter of a papadum, so that was a nice treat.  I also ordered the Nimboo Pani, which I was expecting to be a little sour as it is back home, but found that it was overwhelmingly sweet.   Giving this restaurant 4 stars because I wish there were more options on the menu!   I'll definitely be back - I have my eye on those samosa sliders and Pav Bhaji!"}
{"text":"Not a Indian food expert.. but I like to eat Indian food five or six times a year..   I like this fast food joint! It's in plaza right beside subway and a shawarma place in a commercial area.  Menu is simple, mostly Tikka Hut type street food.  Ordered a Chicken Tikka wrapped in Naan ($7.99) and a Paneer Tikka on white basmati rice ($9.99). Cooked on live charcoal!  Chicken Tikka was awesome! Portioned a bit smaller then a shawarma (since it's right next door).  Has that Indian spice flavour! Chicken was thick and tender (textured like breast).  The veggies they stuffed into the wrap deserves props! The cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, herbs were FINELY chopped!! As opposed to diced size, which says something about their prep work!  The paneer basmati rice was portioned nicely! Paneer blocks were big chunks! Again, props to the veggies. Could have used a bit more time on the grill.. Ordered it spicy.. wasn't enough heat for me.. but they cater to non-Indian clientele.. not say say there weren't Indian customers.   Place gives we a Taco Bell feel but classier, I could see this place franchising soon if it's hasn't already done so.  I would come back and recommend for lunch or possibly consider them for catering."}
{"text":"Have been wanting to try out this place for a while now. Went for lunch at around 1:30pm. It was fairly busy and had a bunch of take out orders.   We ordered the chicken wrap with egg, Samousa chat, chicken rice bowl with added paneer, tea and rabery bites for desert.   The wrap was delicious! Chicken was juicy and fresh. Not as authentic as in other places, more a fusion less spicy version to suit different taste buds. Still very good. The egg added a nice layer of flavour.   The chat was average, could use more of the samousa pastry for the amount of dressing/yogurt.   The rice bowl was not a hit. We picked the medium spicy curry sauce and the sauce was too runny. The paneer on the other hand was very soft and fresh.   The teas comes in a small cup and has free refills. Tea was very hot and strong as it should. We had a few refills, worth it when it's that cold out.   The desert was overpriced for what we actually got,  and the dipping sauce for the deserts lacked flavour and thickness.   Would go there again if in the neighbourhood for the wraps.  Wraps 5/5 Tea 4/5 Customer Service- amazing! Rice bowl - 1/5"}
{"text":"Tip:  Unless you plan to order a Kathi Roll or a Rice/Salad Bowl, it is better to go with a group and order a variety of things!  Located in an industrial area in Matheson E/Satellite, just north of Centennial Park, Chaska is a twist on Indian street food.  Very similar concept to Sindhi.  You order at the counter and when your food is done, the workers honk on horn.  It's quite loud.  A couple of the workers did greet us and ask if we needed any assistance with the menu.  Menu consists of kabob rolls, rice/salad bowls, more snacky type dishes (chaat, samosas, lentil patties), & drinks (lassi, chai).  There are veg/non-veg, white/brown rice, & gluten-free options.  We had: Samosa Chaat - Basically chaat stuff poured on top of 2 samosas.  Samosas were veg and sorta meh.  Thank Vishnu for that sweet/tangy sauce.  South-East Asian friend said it was a bit too sweet for her, but I didn't mind.  Pav Bhaji - 2 smallish, fluffy, toasted & buttered hamburger buns that came with a side of lentil/tomato based curry.  I really liked the curry, especially after adding the squeeze of lime!  There was also a bit of butter cut into the curry.  Panna Mango Drink - from the fridge.  Unexpectedly savoury and gross.  Tasted like liquified chaat with a hint of mango.  When someone came to check-in on us, I told him that my friend didn't like the drink and that I was actually overcharged.  In turn, he went to the fridge and got her a mango lassi which was more \"normal\".  Cutting Chai - Tiny.  Ok in taste, could've used more spices.  I can't emphasise how small this was.  I've had rinse out my mouth, at the dentist, out of a cup larger than that.  I cannot speak of the size of the rolls/bowls, but the snacks/drinks were on the smaller side.  Snacks were perfect...as snack portions, as opposed to full-on Hungry Man/Woman meals.  Drinks, c'mon, need to be supersized especially the Chai!"}
{"text":"Bad customer service. You place order for happy hour pick up at 5:53pm. Reach in store at 5:58pm and wait for them to serve you at the cashier. It' 6:00pm and my turn comes up and they no longer can give me the discount because it's end of happy hour. Half employees will give you the discount after 6pm and half of them can't operate the cash register at 6pm and make random excuses about it. I have ordered plenty of times in the past during normal hours. It's not about discount but this kind of lying is just dissapointing and unnecessary"}
{"text":"Well, more like a 3.5, It is located very close to my workplace and they offer free refills on tea, which is the best thing you can get after an eventful workday. I like their snacks: bhel, samosa sliders and samosa chat etc. However was not impressed by the main dish: kaathi or rice/salad bowl.Thier paneer tikka could be better. my husband tried their lamb bowl and chicken warp both were ahky.  I guess they are exceptionally good for snacks and tea.   The ambience is cool. The decor is good too, it is more themed like a dhaba and their focus is on the Street foods of India.   I go there for the tea which is soo good and Chaska is a good place to go for a tea break after work with friends. It is worth a visit per week :)"}
{"text":"Chaska tastes great but is pricier compared to other great lunch options in the airport corporate area.   The atmosphere is awesome. The order counter is like the side of a truck and the dining area is designed as if you're eating on the side of the road. Very distinctive decor for an Indian restaurant.   I had a Kathi Roll with Chicken Tikka. The chicken was perfect but the roll is very small. A roll on its own will leave you hungry still so I recommend at least adding the side of Samosa Chaat which is a small Samosa with chickpeas, onions and chutney in a small bowl.   My friends ordered rice bowls with Chicken Tikka and Medium Curry. A decent size serving (a lot of rice in a separate bowl) but pricier for a quick lunch bite."}
{"text":"I really thought the service was good, i ordered a few samosas and a lamb kabob bowl, and it was tasteless and just not good,  i am sure they can do better."}
{"text":"Awesome food. A bit of a wait for rice bowls, but definitely worth waiting for. Very flavourful and tasty.   Wraps with samosa are great for lunch. Not too much and not too little food.  Busy place.  Stay away from core lunch hours. We came ar 11:45 and there timing was perfect."}
{"text":"Barn like setting, with lights in air, a bus shaped counter top where once your order is ready they honk the horn to get your attention, extremely rustic with cool Indian beats playing the background, really haven't seen this type of internal setting..   Ummm interested in drinking a healthy yogurt beverage with rose petals floating in it..yes I am talking about the Rose Lassi at cool $3.45 was a steak and a unique twist on an original Lassi!   Also their Rabri bites were extremely authentic and tasty (dessert) $7.99  The mains like Kathi Rolls and grill plates were bland :-(  Overall experience was unique but main items were low on the totem pole!  Ahhh they are playing this Hindi song  maray saiyan g say aaaj main nay break up kar diya..... have to get this song out of my head!!!!"}
{"text":"Great service and a good selection of food. I would come back for lunch again. The two wrap deal is a must is you're trying it for the first time."}
{"text":"My colleague and I, along with our manager, were working late at the office on Thursday night. Our boss asked whether we needed dinner. It was 7:30 pm. I said that we did.   Chaska is a new restaurant that has opened close to our office. My colleague called to ask whether the place was open. Yes! It closes at 9 pm on Thursdays.   We walked over there, which took roughly five minutes. I don't recall what business was there before Chaska,!but Chaska is between Subway and Pita Lite.   You basically pick and choose what you'd like to eat. I went with the chicken tikka with brown rice, medium curry sauce, and a Diet Pepsi. My colleague and I didn't discuss what we wanted, but he ordered the same meal! You can tell that we work so closely together that our food tastes are the same.   Our manager ordered the salmon salad with a mango lassi.   My food was delicious. The chicken was tender. The medium curry sauce was spicier than I had anticipated, but was flavourful.   The decor is trendy and cheerful. I loved the lighting. There are plenty of tables.   I'd come back here for a quick, delicious meal. You can order out, too.   (199)"}
{"text":"Onverwacht ontzettend lekker gegeten! Goed concept met overzichtelijk menu waarin je zelf je combinatie samenstelt. Kathi roll met vis was om je vingers bij af te likken. Absolute aanrader voor hele leuke prijs. Ik kan niet wachten tot Chaska naar Nederland komt!"}
{"text":"Went there not knowing what to expect and was pleasantly surprised. The inside serving area is designed to look like a food truck / school bus. Staff were pretty friendly.   Thr experience is very much like Chipotle in that you pick a dish and then customize it. I found this to be easier than ordering at Chipotle as they have preselected toppings already.   I had the rice bowl with Paneer. Was blown away by the presentation of this take out style restaurant.  Food  was pretty good as well. Would definitly go again."}
{"text":"First off, this place doesn't deserve less than all 5 stars. There's passion and tons of flavor in anything you get here. I personally would recommend this place to everybody I know because it's a total necessity to try. Once you go in, you're not coming out the same. I'm truly a Chaska fan. Period.   I typically stick to plant based foods, but I broke that when trying the Mushroom Tikka, and my goodness I was blown away. The samosa sliders are hands down, FIRE! Sooooo good. The chutney is perfect, the bun is light and fluffy, and the samosa batter is next level stuff.   That being said, I'm glad I tried the non-plant based options because now I know what I'll be missing out on next time I go. Although I've been told I'm going to be blown away by the Chickpea Bowl. I'm looking forward to it.   Last but not least, the chef and staff are a great vibe. The environment and energy there is so welcoming. I'll be back, again and again... and again!"}
{"text":"I heard of this new opening in Sauga and immediately went online to check out its menu and concept. It was pretty unique and I was intrigued, so scheduled it in for my weekend lunch plan.  Chaska is located in an area that seems fairly new, since its a pretty sparce location and surrounded by newly renovated business buildings. I was hidden, facing away from the main road, which may explain why it was completely empty once we entered in.  The decor was pretty well done, with hanging lights on the ceiling and a bright 'Chaska' sign lit up on the wall.  Since this restaurant is still new, the men working there were extremely attentive and friendly, whereby they kindly approached us and explained the concept of ordering. We had a choice of a wrap, salad bowl, or rice bowl. On display were the salad bowls from which we could choose, along with the range of lassis they served (almond, rose, and mango), and some other indian drinks and desserts (sweet rice and gulab jamun). I ordered the goat tikka on a salad, while the others ordered the mint paneer with rice and paneer tikka with rice. We also got the chaat papdi as an appetizer. They then informed us that the goat tikka will take around 25 minutes, since they make it fresh. We waited while eating our chaat papdi (pieces of chips and other crispy snacks all smothered in a yogurt mixture) and drinking the rose and mango lassi (which were delicious)! The food finally arrived, served in those recyclable to-go containers. Since I got a salad, I had a choice for a dressing. I chose the mint, coriander & yogurt dressing, which was perfect for what I ordered, since goat tikka can get pretty dry, so this definitely helped. The rice dishes also had a choice of sauce, for which the vindaloo sauce was chosen based on the fact that it was meant to be the spiciest. Apparently the rice bowls were good too, but the sauce was a bit too heavy on the cumin spice. While eating, two more people walked in, who looked like they came in for a quick lunch straight from work, which should be expected based on the location. Overall, I really enjoyed it. The serving size was good and food was fresh and tasty. I really hope the service and food maintains this way. I have noticed that newly opened restaurants start-off making food from scratch, showing a lot of passion for their cooking. But with time all the food becomes pre-cooked to keep up with demand (e.g., Sindhi restaurant).  I also feel that if Chaska was located somewhere more popular it would definitely do great. But you never know, with more publicity the place may really hype up. I'll for sure visit again!"}
{"text":"OMG. Beautiful ambiance. Love the decor. Food was delicious. I ordered samosa sliders and pav bhaji with chai. Everything was fabulous from the beginning to the end."}
{"text":"Tucked in the middle of industrial Mississauga is a little gem of a place. My friend and I came here for dinner, since they are open until 9pm. We had the fish kathi roll, mint paneer kathi roll, chana chawal and chai. This was definitely more than enough food for two. The fish kathi roll was really good, the outside was really flaky and the fillings were super flavourful. The chai comes in really tiny glasses but if you dine in there are free refills! The first few cups were ok, but the last two cups (new batch) were amazing! I think there was some extra ginger in there or something it was so good!! Staff were super friendly and the place wasn't packed at all for dinner. The vibes are cool, we felt like we were in a place downtown, albeit more spacious. It's kind of out of the way if you don't work in the area, but I'd say it's worth the visit."}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY?!?  If you're hungry, try the salad bowl or the rice bowl. If you're not as hungry, you can opt for the kathi rolls!   The restaurant itself is located in an industrial area. The decor in this restaurant is pretty cute and I liked how the front of their ordering counter resembles the front of a bus. Pretty neat.   The vindaloo sauce that I added to the rice bowl can be pretty spicy so if you're a typical spicy veteran, you might want to go for the mild or medium sauce. I liked the fact that there's a few options even for vegetarian options(at least four!) and you can choose between white and brown rice. The only feedback I have for the rice bowl is that there's too much water on the bottom of the bowl. It must have come from the salad portion of the rice bowl. If they can change the ladle to scoop the salad, this might help keep the water out from being added to the rice bowl as well!   My friend ordered the kathi rolls. Unlike the pita bread, they used Indian style flatbread as the wrap that was cooked on a tava, which is essentially a frying pan. I liked the flatbread texture a lot. Very chewing and not thick!  They have Indian chai tea with unlimited refills! They kept coming back to us with a pot to refill our cups. The cup is small though so for the price you're paying ($1.99), you might want to take advantage of that. It's pretty hot and they boil more throughout the night.   LAST TIP?!   There's street favorites on their menu so take advantage of that. Kathi rolls are on special - 2 rolls for 9.99 veg option or 2 rolls for 14.99 non veg option Mondays and Tuesday's. The chai tea is a good option to order if you love Indian chai tea because there's unlimited refills!! And lastly, other than mango lassi, they also have rose lassi which you don't find typically at other restaurants!"}
{"text":"Checked into Chaska because one of our friend's suggested to try this place closest to Toronto Airport and said they loved it. So was in that neck of the woods to drop a friend at Toronto Airport and decided to try them out.   The restaurant is in a building complex amidst office buildings and ware houses or Airport service buildings. Don't miss driving past it but that building has just restaurants - so you would not miss much!  Very creative interior given the feeling of a roadside dhaba. The restaurant was created keeping in mind to bring the street foods of India to the patrons. Hence the creative menu with options between rice bowl, Salad bowl, kati roll, grill platter/tandoori and desert option. We were about 5 of us and took a spin at the menu. I tried the Mint Chicken Kati roll with egg - oh my oh..it has been a while I had a good Kati roll - reminded me of my times in Chennai where we used to go to the Frankie shops in Alwarpet and Ispahani Center. It was not too spicy and the masalas were a perfect blend and did not feel like they were store brought. One of my friend tried the Samosa Chaat and it was good portion to eat and taste was very good. One of the other friend tried the rice bowl with Chicken tikka and was very good as well both in taste and portion.   The highlight that I would call out were the Mango Panna drink - real indian street food and the bottomless chai....both were excellent.   I will definitely go back again to Chaska to check out their other menu items and will take more friends and definitely recommend the place.   I would have given a five star to this place, had they kept it opened for Sunday...yeah..they are closed on Sunday and open from Monday to Saturday only!!!    Very reasonably priced for good portion Indian street food....go to Chaska!"}
