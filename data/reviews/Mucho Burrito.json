{"text":"I love this place!  When I have a hankering for the best burrito in town, Mucho Burrito is the only place I go.  I usually have a regular barbacoa (shredded beef) burrito with brown rice, black beans, sautéed veggies and lots of extra cilantro on a whole wheat tortilla...YUM!  I've been here several times and I'm never disappointed."}
{"text":"Had two chicken tacos with cheese, lettuce, guac, and the mild salsa.  Tacos are good but nothing special.  Typical fast food.  Walk a little further west to Wilbur Mexicana on King Street past Spadina if you want much better Mexican that is fast and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I've recently discovered this place - way to go for a custom made how you want Mexican food made to order, although I do find the prices a little high. If the prices weren't so high I would come in more often. I can't believe they're always trying to sell me guacamole for $1 for a scoop - that should be automatically included without extra cost. Staff are friendly, courteous & remember us but when paying for a quick burrito or 2 & paying debit & wanting a tip?! seriously!?"}
{"text":"Went into this restaurant at 10:00 pm (closes at 10:30pm) and was told they had no rice!!! Clearly too cheap to make new batch so close to closing. How does a burrito joint run out of rice? I was hungry so I still ordered a burrito and they made no effort to add any extra ingredients AND charged me full price!!!   Do yourself and stay away from this place. Go to a restaurant that respects its customers."}
{"text":"Haven't been to this Mucho Burrito in awhile although I live in the area, I always left it as last option. So today I didn't expect much but was actually quite pleased. The staff was friendly and the place was cleaner than I remember. I ordered fish tacos and they were pretty decent--I've had better but these weren't the worst. I would actually come and visit mucho burrito now if I crave tacos!"}
{"text":"This location has gone downhill. My husband and I both got food poisoning. The food looked old and looking and that should have been a red flag. I would recommend going across the street to Fat Bastard. Better service, better food and cleaner."}
{"text":"Our first and last time at mucho burrito disappointed after craving burritos. We went late and it showed on the woman's face, so we quickly ordered so she could get home. The serving size was so small and definitely not worth the $23 for the 2 burrito bowls we wanted. The chicken was burned, had no taste and was barely there. My husband expressed his distaste for the very small portion size and the lady offered more rice! We were hoping the food would make up for the poor service, but it did not.  We will drive 10 mins up the road and go to Chipotle instead next time. Felt like a waste of money and the poor taste left in our mouths from the experience was not just from the food :/"}
{"text":"Best burrito in the area, always fresh.  Even better than the American Chipotle franchise!"}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting Mucho Burrito, and based on that experience alone, I would be back.  I've had my fair share of visits to Mexican-type, burrito chains (Burrito Boyz comes to mind), without much luck. Ya see, I'm not a fan of cilantro (aka coriander). I absolutely hate it. I will deal with it when necessary (usually in salsa is fine because it's always pre-made and it's very faint), but I cannot stand it when it's used as a garnish. This is why I tend to stray from Burrito Boyz because I'm pretty sure they cook their protein with cilantro. Gag.  Mucho Burrito, however, does not. YAY! Boy, was I ever pleased. I ordered a chicken quesadilla, which came loaded with cheese, chicken, peppers and onions. I was mulling around the idea of getting a combo (chips and salsa), but glad I didn't because that thing was massive and came with a side of sour cream and salsa.  It was delicious. And they even have a liquor license! I had a Corona with mine. Yum!"}
{"text":"The food is very good...a little pricey...place is clean and the staff is frendly. Healthy food choices."}
{"text":"Guess I am use to Chipotle in the US where they dont measure everything with a lil cup. I like mexican and wish that we could get a really decent one un yyc!  The food taste is decent but have a tough time with the proportions that we get offered here with the price we pay."}
{"text":"Just opened. The place is clean and the staff is pretty friendly. Food is pretty good for this type of restaurant and the prices aren't horrible either!"}
{"text":"Such a relief to find this place!  It's not quite as good as Chipotle, but for the range of Mexican available in Calgary, it's outstanding.  It's fresh and tasty.  Not too expensive and so it's a nice lunch & well worth the drive.  I have to say, though, that the salsa & hot sauce selection was kind of gringo-style.  Not like chipotle is THAT authentic, but hey.  I'm allowed a gripe or two."}
{"text":"I have gone enough that I feel I can give this location a decent review. My main problem is there isn't much consistency. For example... tonight my burrito was awful.   Overall, the serving area is pretty tidy. I usually go at busy times so it could be worse. But there's sometimes certain foods that have made their way into other bins and it's not a good call for people like me who can't eat onions to all of a sudden have an onion in their rice!  The portions are good, I'm always full. But again, sometimes you get barely any of a certain topping and other times it's overwhelming. Tonight for example... I feel anyone who adds jalapeños is expecting a teaspoon's worth on a small or medium. I bet I had a freaking tablespoon on a small. I couldn't even finish and thoroughly didn't enjoy it.   What really boggles my mind... my server today placed the ingredients and started wrapping. He saw that the salsa was on half and the burrito sauce was on the other half.. yet he wrapped it up. I asked for the second (not for me) to be wrapped a different way... he tried to move the ingredients around but I don't think he really cared much for his job and didn't wrap it the way I suggested.  I don't know what to say about this place... would I go back... yea because when it's good it's really really good. But when it's bad, it's really disappointing."}
{"text":"I know, I know...it's a chain! But it was good for a quick lunch! The small burrito was perfect - not too heavy but filling. I had the shredded beef burrito and it was great. They let you do half servings of the rice and beans and add extra veggies too. I'd go back for another quick lunch.   Guac shouldn't cost extra!"}
{"text":"Mucho Burrito is Chipotle's bland Canadian cousin.  By \"bland\" I don't mean not spicy. They will give you habanero sauce if you want it. But their pork, chicken and beans are devoid of any seasoning. And their veggies are often undercooked, often making raw green pepper the dominant flavour in a burrito.  In this location in particular, watch out for them being skimpy with the cheese. They'll fill the scoop, and then quickly tap 1/3rd of it on to your burrito. Watch out for dry, crunchy white rice as well.  I appreciate that Mucho Burrito exists, and except for the price it's a better option than Taco Time or Taco Bell. But it's not all that good."}
{"text":"Only reason I even walk in to this place is because it's relatively healthy. The only problem is they are ultra stingy on the vegetables and all the green items. I'm sure it's probably because they have to cut cost to pay the franchise their cut. A rating of one for being stingy."}
{"text":"It's no chipotle, not even close.  Service was substandard.  The location was empty and I now see why.  The rice was bland, the meat was dry, the sour cream was runny, the chips were stale and the guacamole was brown.  We will not return.  I would rather travel to chipotle as the prices are similar for much better food and service.  To top it all off my stomach was turning all night.  TWO BIG THUMBS DOWN!"}
{"text":"Food is low grade and bland. Very little veggies and what can I say about the sour cream...I don't think it can be diluted more than that.  Service is cold, not friendly. And the food is prepared in front of you and is literally dumped in the plate. The employees are obviously not paid enough or treated well and it reflects in their attitude toward the customers. Go there quick, it's bound to be out of business in a few months."}
{"text":"If you want to eat here make sure you bring MUCHO DINERO!!! Way over priced for a mediocre burrito . For the price that you pay for that burrito the guac should be an automatic garnishment, not 99c  for half a tablespoon. Furthermore the meat quality is gross and clearly frozen/processed.  Chipotle makes this place look like a joke"}
{"text":"Worst burrito place ever. Nothing authentic here. Drive across the street to a way better burrito shop or visit burrito boyz on Winston Churchill and Dundas. This is basically 1 step up from taco bell which isnt saying much"}
{"text":"This place has the worst customer service and will scam you! My girlfriend and I ordered two fish bowls, the server gave us generous portions, however, when it came time for checkout, the manager decided to charge us for extra for everything that was in our bowl. They even charged us for extra meat, when we did not even asked for extra meat!! On a side note, this place never has their drink section stocked, and they forgot to include cutleries in our takeout."}
{"text":"This is like restaurant quality food at a fast food joint. You can get a nice fresh burrito the size of your arm in 5 minutes. I don't know how they cram so many toppings in there.  The building itself is really nice, big plasma screens playing sports, nice looking setup.  Definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"I was disappointed with the service and the quantity of food. Quality was ok but for $11 a \"regular\" bowl that was 1/3 full is too much. The server was so stingy with the food. He would fill a serving spoon and then shake it out to drop some food out. After finishing my plate I had to go to Amir next door to have a real lunch. After being to chipotle so many times and expecting a similar or better experience, I was certainly disappointed. Not going back there. I'm giving 2 stars cause the place is clean and food tasted ok. Hope they look into their portion size."}
{"text":"It was cold outside, we were hungry, it was getting late. They do not have a soy option for vegetarians which was an instant downer I got enchiladas which were runny and a bit bland even with spicy hot sauce, my boyfriend got the beef tacos which were tiny (you could barely fit any toppings in them) and served with chunks of meat vs ground.  I ate maybe half my enchiladas and decided that was enough, I won't be back. They do serve beer though, so maybe if you get pissed drunk the food will taste awesome?"}
{"text":"Horrendous food; like absolutely awful. Not to mention they charged an extra 50 cents per tilapia taco even though the menu board only mentions this surcharge for guacamole and shrimp. Seriously, don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. Staff was very friendly but the food was just \"meh\".  I had a quesadilla with beans, cheese, peppers, and onions and somehow it was blah and lacking in flavour and taste. I had a side of guacamole, which was also lacking in flavour. Can't say I would be in a hurry to get back to this place."}
{"text":"Service was as to be expected (not thrilled, not disappointed).  Food selection is sparse. While the food tasted ok, it was rather expensive for what was received. Wouldn't go again."}
{"text":"This is no chipotle. The Food doesn't taste fresh . It all seems to have a very processed chemical taste to it. I also simply don't eat here anymore because I found a rat or dog hair in my vegetables. Not sure which is worse? Also their guacamole is terrible worse than the stuff you buy vacuum packed at the store."}
{"text":"One of my go-to spots if I want a burrito for lunch. Comparing the burrito joints available in the Path, Mucho Burrito stands out with its hot salsa, because there's actually heat in it! Most of the \"hot\" salsa from the other burrito places are nowhere near an adequate spicy level."}
{"text":"Today I was surprised by my amazing woman of love. She brought me this GIANT burrito called \"Mucho Burrito\" It had the carnitas and everything had perfect spice. Even the rice was spicy. LOVE Also this burrito was PACKED with meat and yes it had a lot of rice but man.. IT WAS GOOOD! It was love in a burrito for the first time.  I'm Latino and let me tell you. I never had a burrito this good EVER! It filled me up for the whole day, followed by a little pain from eating the whole thing. \"Due to burrito goodness\" Mucho Burrito I give you 100 out of 10. Good Job! :)"}
{"text":"It's an okay tasting burrito -- but compared to some other burrito places, they have a limited topping selection and the prices are on the high-side.   Great if you are in a hurry and just need something quick. If you're craving a delicious burrito and have some time, I'd look elsewhere."}
{"text":"The biggest culture shock for me, an American in Toronto whose diet consists basically of Mexican and Indian foods for 90% of my meals, was the lack of options for a decent lunchtime burrito.  The burritos here are pretty good; Mucho Burrito lies in the acceptable range somewhere between the cardboard-y Z-teca and the excellent Burrito Boyz.   The lines and seating situation at FCP at lunch is ridiculous though."}
{"text":"Based on previous reviews, I stopped in Friday after work.       Roughly 6:30, there was a pretty good lineup to order - which speaks to the popularity of the food.   And the food WAS smelling great, so by the time I made it to the front of the line, I was eager to get it on!  I ordered a 12\" buritto - the medium size, which was plenty -- and 4 tacos (no, it wasn't all for me!).        Good stuff!!     Service was friendly and efficient.  I'm guessing the guy who took my order is also the owner, as he was running the show and clearly hands on.  Though the restaurant was quite busy, he still took the time to patiently walk each \"first timer\" through the options and process.    All the ingredients were very fresh.  Veggies were being stir fried on the stove, and beef hand sliced, as the diners made their way down the counter.    The meat burrito choices included shredded chicken or beef, tilapia, chorizo, and sliced beef .  I went shredded beef, but I plan on trying all of these eventually!  Fresh green and red salsas, from pico de gallo to hot, looked great.  I went for the optional $1.00 shot of Guac . to compliment my choices of rice, black beans, veggies, hot salsa, cheese, sour cream, and diced jalapenos.   Cilantro was optional, which I appreciated.  I'm not a big fan, so It's nice to be able to skip it.  The burrito was overall delicious, and satisfying.  But I almost wished I had ordered the XL size to prolong the experience.    On this trip, I was getting my food to go -- but I would definitely eat in sometime.  The large booths and general atmosphere of this place made it more inviting than I expected."}
{"text":"We eat here about once every couple week as an alternative to cooking. I prefer it to some of the other more authentic Mexican food in Calgary.The chicken, pork, and beef are all juicy, tasty choices. These always taste fresh and fall apart in your mouth in the best way. You can load up with beans of your choice, veggies, and your choice of salsa. I always end off with burrito sauce (chipotle sauce) for extra kick as I am a condiment lover. I have no complaints about the food, always full of spice and flavor. The prawns were nice and spicy but not as nice in texture as the other meats. If it ain't broke, don't fix it!  I give 4 stars because some of the newer staff are pretty darn slow preparing the food. But it is always worth the wait.  Hungry for a burrito now...."}
{"text":"Inconsistent portion sizes. First time: place was empty; medium size burrito was decent-sized.  Second time: came during busy lunchtime, ordered a small and a medium burrito, same amount of meat in both... WTF?  So come here when it's not busy.  If it looks busy inside, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Would have given the place 5 stars but the staff was still trying to learn the ropes.  This just meant that the food prep was a little slow than it shud be. Despite the slow service the staff was friendly.   That said the food was fresh and flavorful.  Reminded me of a place I use to eat at in Houston.   Well worth dropping by."}
{"text":"The first couple times I came here it was good food and good service.  It has gone down hill (by a lot).  When I first started going, the portion sizes were good, but not anymore.  I always order a veggie burrito bowl and when they are making it they ask, \"veggies?\"...Well yes, I am ordering a VEGGIE burrito bowl.  Then they only put a tiny bit of their pepper and onion mix into the bowl.  You'd think that for the price (almost the same as the meat burritos) that they would put some extra veggies in a veggie bowl (or at least enough to make it worthwhile).  Anyways, the food is usually fresh, but i have stopped going since I have found much better burrito spots to go to now."}
{"text":"I gotta say I drive by here everyday wanting to stop in and never have time to. Well tonight I made time and I'm glad. I ordered the regular chicken burrito on whole wheat. It was amazing. And the fact that it didn't fall apart on me was great. I highly recommend this place and will be returning. And the service was top notch."}
{"text":"Comparing this to chipotle, it isn't. The food portions were tiny. The guy was putting one spoon full of rice and beans etc. being very careful to only put one spoon.   The menus are crowded with different colors and fonts. I was confused looking at the menus. Chipotle has very simple and minimalist menus.   Would I recommend this place? Eh for someone who wants try it sure. But don't expect to be full if you only take the bowl (chicken rice beans veggies). Ps for reference i had to add extra chicken and guac. If I eat the same bowl at chipotle I'm really full."}
{"text":"I would give it zero stars, but that's not possible. Avoid this place. Food isn't very good and the worst customer service I have ever witnessed."}
{"text":"Like a sandwich place but for burritos!  Good selection -  tacos, burritos, salad bowls, burrito bowls, quesadillas  Basically, you select what you want, the size, and then choose all the toppings. Great selection of meats (pulled pork, beef, steak, chicken, fish, others?)   Toppings are great, fresh sauteed veggies, beans, regular fresh veggies, guacamole ($) and different salsas and sauces.  The service was great and friendly. I ordered a burrito (10\" was too big for me) and it was stuffed full with rice and spiced chicken. The other person ordered a salad bowl, basically like a taco on a salad in a tortilla bowl.   Delicious! Would definitely go back.   Oh, and they're licensed! So if you want a quick cheap Mexican beer and a quesadilla, it's the right spot!"}
{"text":"The burritos are packed so much that it's impossible to hold it in your hands.  And cold served."}
{"text":"Things that should be hot were ice cold and quite \"aged\" - never again for tacos."}
{"text":"This place is pathetic. Over priced burritos meat is dry veggies are soggy. Gave me a meat burrito and I don't eat meat. I was told to come in and pick up replacement and the punk staff treated me like I was a thief. Go to Taco Bell down the road same disgusting food for a fraction of the cost.  I did give it my best. I've been 4 times all for times I paid 70-100 dollars (family of 4) not good staff punks punks punks. I'm going to Niji Sushi where the food is great as is the staff and prices."}
{"text":"We have been to this place for a couple of times now, usually to buy burritos to take away. The food always was of reasonably good quality and also warm. You have lots of choices putting your burrito together.   After all, this is a low cost outfit and you get exactly what you pay for.  Deducting one star because some of the folks behind the counter don't speak English well, which sometimes makes ordering a bit difficult."}
{"text":"Mucho applies to the price and the disappointment but certainly not the taste or the quality. Easily qualifies as the worst $14 burrito. The experience was only saved by good service. Chipotle isn't loosing any sleep over this place."}
{"text":"Ugggh. Chipotle this is not. I really had *such* high hopes for the place.   I figured that even a ripoff of the Chipotle concept would be great. Well, Food is ok but really not memorable, Prices are on the high side and the kicker is that they are soooo stingy with their portioning.   When you go to Chipotle, ok Perhaps the meat portion is controlled but everything else is soooo abundant and unlimited. Think overflowing bowls and 4 different kinds of salsas including a Corn salsa filled in generous containers on the side.   On the other hand, at Mucho, they are unbelievably cheap on everything. picture getting a regular size burrito bowl that is only a third full even after you have prompted the employees to portion more generously.   Even when I paid for a side of guacamole, I only got a tablespoon worth.   This place just isn't worth it IMO."}
{"text":"I will start by saying I have never reviewed anything before and I specifically downloaded the app just to write this review. That is how frustrated I am.  This was my first time going to this location and I haven't been to Mucho in over a year.  Their menu has changed.  I needed to ask some questions so I let the people behind me go ahead so I wouldn't hold them up.  The gentleman helping me didn't answer any of my questions,  seemed to ignore them and acted frustrated I was slowing him down (I was the only one in line). I ended up leaving frustrated. If I were the owner of this location I would want to know how rude and unhelpful my employees were being so I could get them proper training."}
{"text":"Attrape nigot et service pourri, Le monsieur asiatique dernière le comptoir coupe les sous en 4...Il te met 3 grain de fromage dans ton burrito et si tu en veux plus c'est un extra!?!?!?"}
{"text":"Due to your exceptionally poor service and horrendous portion sizes it appears you've lost yet another customer. Recognize that cutting people short with toppings might save you money in the short term but lose someone's business going forward. Will not return."}
{"text":"If you're giving this place 5 stars you're due to move out of mom's basement! Food was terrible...first time I've ever eaten a burrito other than at taco bell. When we arrived the meat in the can looked like dog food. I asked 2 or 3 times just to make sure that wasnt what they would serve. Luckily, they pulled fresh or resently cooked meat out of a heater rack covered in plastic wrap. So likely this meat was made for tomorrow as it was an hour before closing. The girl threw out the meat in the window and her boss added around one cup of the fresh meat to the chicken and steak container.  Lots of stuff goes into the burrito but not the stuff that counts. For the $7.50 for one small burrito and then add in a pop, I should have just gone for a pint and pound for $10.99 next door. Lesson learned....the school will keep this place floating but those of us that are cultured in food won't return."}
{"text":"Mucho Burrito is a good alternative to a veal sandwich when lunching in Vaughan.  They are fast, really filling, and delicious. This location is in the colossus plaza off the 400 so can be easy to miss.   Like most burrito chains you can pick your size (small, medium, Mucho), meats (chicken, fish, pork, beef.... forget what else), salsa, etc.   I like to get - medium burrito, little bit of rice, veggies, black beans, hot salsa, jalapenos, guacamole, and lettuce - then grilled - try it, it's delicious.  Caution: for other cilantro haters out there -- they ask you if you want extra cilantro on your burrito but don't caution you that the corn salsa is loaded with it (only made that mistake once)   Other things to note: guacamole is extra, but worth it  You can also order you burrito smothered which a bunch of stuff - haven't tried it b/c it looks really messy, but i bet it is good.  They are also licensed and serve beer!"}
{"text":"Food wasn't bad, not even close to Mexican... I mean, they asked me if I wanted cheese on my quesadilla. Pretty sure that's the queso part of the word \"ques\"adilla."}
{"text":"Love Mucho Burrito. Way better than Chipotle.  The pork option is my favourite - so full of flavour. I also like the different choices of sizes and the staff is great about providing extra sour cream and salsas on the side.   Great lunch place.   If there is one downside however, the last Saturday I went mid-afternoon and I found most tables messy while there were no customers in line! That was a bit of a turnoff.   All and all would still be back."}
{"text":"Have tried several types of burritos here. Comments:  Bland ingredients, limited selection. Not generous on quantity, bit disagreeable when asked for a bit more. Guacamole is an extra buck and you get very little. No selection of hot sauces except to add at table.  Sucks for takeout.   Biggest issue is inconsistent quantities between food preparers. I will often let people go ahead of me in line to get the   ones that prepare a nice big burrito not the Little stingy ones.   Courtesy is good. Store and kitchen are clean. Price versus food quality and quantity does not compare well to other places such as Fat Bastard.    1.5 to 2 stars"}
{"text":"They don't skimp out at this location! You get plenty of good quality meat. Toppings looked fresh. Guy does good job of mixing burrito and folding it"}
{"text":"They put an excessive amount of rice in my burrito and hardly any meat. I also noticed that the meat was very dry- like it had been sitting a long time."}
{"text":"Honestly, great food! Much better then all the other Mexican places in the area. Still can't compare to a real Mexican burrito but still good in there own way."}
{"text":"\"we are too busy ...\"  I usually called ahead and pick up my order.   Last time I called, they simply said they are too busy and will not take take-out order at that time.  Well, with that kind of service, I hope they will never have to take any orders any more and ran out of business quickly ."}
{"text":"Good food, never had a bad experience. I've tried a few things on the menu but i like the super suiza the best. I keep coming back so good job guys."}
{"text":"They took forever to make the tilapia and when they finally finished the tilapia was as big as my pinky and burnt. The lady who took our orders had a hearing problem and it took us several tries to get her to understand our order correctly."}
{"text":"I've been to a few Mucho Burrito's and this location is as good as the others. I ordered the El Clasico quesadilla which was a generous size loaded with toppings. The staff was friendly even though it was somewhat busy. For fast food is pretty authentic."}
{"text":"Good choices, great prices! Healthy food, served up fresh and quickly."}
{"text":"When your hungry and want a wickedly filling and tasty mean Mucho will satisfy your needs. When MB first opened in Aurora you were sure to get lots of toppings but after time it started to feel like you were getting less and less but now after a little bit of a rough patch it looks like they are back to what made us enjoy there burritos. Great burritos and bowls."}
{"text":"I've been to couple of other locations, but this is by far one of the better ones. The employees working there are really polite, and it never gets old watching them roll up a burrito to absolute perfection. They have plenty of options besides the burrito, such as quesadillas, tacos, nachos, and even soup. If you have not tried Mucho Burrito, then you are missing out. This location even has a sign to inform first time customers on how to order, and the people working there are more then happy to answer any of your questions.  Also, I would absolutely recommend anyone trying Mucho Burrito, order their burritos first. Their smallest burrito is 10''! That's almost as big as Subway's foot long. Don't even get me started on the Mucho size, that monster is 14''! When ordering a burrito they have a variety of things they put inside like rice, beans, veggies, meat, cheese, salsa, etc. My personal favourite is a medium(12'') chicken burrito.  They also have some great deals on certain days. I think on Mondays and Tuesdays are when they have free kids meals. When you make an order, you can also choose to make your meal into a combo. The things you can get in a combo are chips with salsa, cinnamon rolls, cookies, and they all come with a drink. They are even licensed to sell beer, you can't get that at McDonalds!   In conclusion, this location is fantastic with its fine service, good food, and for their GUACAMOLE! I LOVE GUACAMOLE! To all Mexican food-lovers and fans, Mucho Burrito does not fail to satisfy their customers, and therefore receives the rating that it deserves."}
{"text":"First thing is first.  It is REALLY hard to find good Mexican food in Toronto. So when I first checked out Mucho Burrito (near the Colossus movie theatre) I was a bit skeptical to say the least.   However, their burritos really were fantastic.  Excellent choice of toppings, fair prices, and even the deserts were great.  My only minor gripe was that the \"hot\" salsa should have been much spicier, but otherwise I only have good things to say about this place."}
{"text":"Great service, welcoming atmosphere and tasty food made fast and fresh."}
{"text":"Bad service, horrible food, rude staff. I would strongly advise to avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"I recently came from California, and was craving burrito, so I came here hoping for chipotle quality burrito.  The price was bit higher than Chipotle, but the portion size was reasonable. Staff were friendly enough. But the quality of the food is what really broke the deal for me. Their carne asada was dry and of cheap quality. Their rice was done wrong. Their salsas were sub par and their burrito sauce was an imitation at best.  Overall, I had what resembled a burrito and I sure wont be coming back here as what they have clearly isnt Mexican food. I was initially going to give this place 2 stars, hut giving it 1 as other ppl gave this place way too much credit for what they deserve."}
{"text":"When this place first opened, it was fantastic.  Good staff (especially Leslie) that made really tasty burritos.  Then one day, I noticed the staff was different.  That should have been a clue.   That was the day when I realized you could actually make a bad burrito.  That was also the last burrito I ever bought from this Mucho Burrito location."}
{"text":"I've been here many times for lunch as I work in the area.  I usually get a  bare bowl (no tortilla) and I generally find the food okay.  My problem is that they are so stingy on toppings that the bowl is often half empty.  I ask for extra peppers (after getting about 3 strips of green/red pepper) and they told me it would be an extra charge.  This happens all the time so I have written it off as a one time mistake.  Also I don't find the staff friendly (maybe I am asking too much). I would rather go to Chipotle even if it costs more."}
{"text":"We had never been here before and didn't know what to expect.  We were greeted as soon as we walked through the door and then were guided through the various options.  The young man who served us was friendly and the food was good.  We will definitely go back there."}
{"text":"To my shock and horror, the Quesada Mexican Grill in the Sheraton Centre was closed on a Saturday I went into work without a lunch. So, craving a burrito, and having left my jacket in my office, I decided to PATH it over to the Eaton Centre. There had to be some burrito place there.  Ok, so this place in the food court looked decently clean so I stepped up to the counter and asked for a 10\" burrito (the size I normally order at Quesada). I was told that this was a \"snack size\" and that for less than a dollar I should upgrade to the 12\". I said I wanted the small. So the guy tells me it's \"more for kids\" and it's less than a dollar. Ok, I wanted to get back to work rather than continuing arguing, so fine.  When I'm paying, the woman charges me for more than I thought it would cost. The receipt said I ordered a fish burrito. Less than a minute ago, the guy who prepped the burrito told her that I ordered chicken. I pointed this out to her and she pulls out an insincere \"sorry\" with a frown and practically throws a handful of change (don't even know if it was right) at me.  Even without the mucho dishonesty, the burrito was meh. I ordered everything spicy, but it wasn't spicy at all. The salsa had no flavour and the vegetables tasted as though they had been boiled, and for too long a time.   The next time Quesada Mexican Grill is closed, I'll crawl back to my office and get my jacket to go to Burrito Boyz."}
{"text":"Overpriced average tasting burritos, regular is like a small, might as well just go to FitForLife and get two burritos for the same price that almost tastes identical.  Should have checked the reviews first."}
{"text":"This is by far, the worst burrito I have ever had. Burritos are my favourite food and I try one everywhere I can.   This chicken is so plain it is almost like they didn't try to put seasoning on it (let alone mexican seasoning). The ingredients were so scarce and they don't press the burrito. It is similarly priced to burrito boys, burrito bandidos, and chipotle, so don't even bother trying this one! You will not be missing anything!"}
{"text":"Not impressed with the food. All very tasteless and portion sizes were smaller than Chipotle."}
{"text":"Worst Mexican place to eat ever. High priced for a bad experience. Limited toppings. No taste."}
{"text":"As far as mucho goes in this city... This place is a above (and sometimes an extra scoop of chicken) beyond the others. Thx guys, this location has never let me down!"}
{"text":"Pretty much a Chipotle knock off, but not as good.  SERVICE Service was really slow mostly due to customer indecision.  PRICING I was irked by their misrepresentation.  I asked for guacamole to be added to my Taco Trio.  They promptly said that will be an extra $0.50, which I said is fine.  I just looked at my receipt when I got home and saw that they charged me $0.50 PER taco which is actually $1.50!  The receipt read 3 Extra Half Guacamole.  I feel ripped off.  3 tacos $9.95 base price (without guacamole)  FOOD They differentiate from Chipotle by offering smothered burritos, chorizo sausage as protein option, lime wedge with tacos and chopped cilantro.  They have Dos Equis lager on tap (in case you're feeling like being \"the most interesting man in the world\") and bottles of Jarritos (very traditional Mexican bottled soda pop line including a nice cane sugar Cola)  The corn tortillas are actually a corn-wheat hybrid --- which is another misrepresentation. I really don't like them; I expected real 100% corn tortillas.  I got a different type of meat in each taco, but the two shredded meats (beef Barbacoa and pork Carnitas) were so juicy that they sogged the tortilla and the entire bottom fell out of both.  Ridiculously messy experience that required 6 napkins and immediately washing my hands after the meal.  Get less messy chicken, shrimp, or carne asada (steak) to avoid the same fate.  Tacos do not come with the grilled peppers/onions like other menu items.  The meats are flavourful enough, but not spicy unless one of the varying degrees of spicy salsa is added.  I do like that their food is not overloaded with salt.  They panini press their quesadillas versus griddling them.  WASHROOMS The women's washrooms that only has one toilet was overflowing.  Gross.  VIBE Staff were far from cheery which didn't really match the fun, kitschy marketing and signage.    ACCESSIBILITY There is enough room for wheelchairs/walkers to navigate in the restaurant and washroom.  The double set of doors (vestibule) might make it hard for a person dining alone to get through the doors without assistance. The menu boards are visible, but the ingredients are not likely visible from a wheelchair. There are plenty of tables with pull out chairs in addition to window/bar seating. Fair amount of free parking spots right in front of the door; pretty sure there was a ramp up to the sidewalk/entrance."}
{"text":"Been here a handful of times and always fully satisfied when leaving.  Portions are huge, you get to customize exactly what you want your burrito to be, and the price isn't too expensive."}
{"text":"Love this place- huge portions though! Great tasting food and a bit pricey. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I really like this place.  Friendly service,  fresh tasty food.  Ingredients are fresh and the burritos are big. Seating area is always clean"}
{"text":"So went there Friday night around 9 mucho chicken burritos, one for there and one to take home, sat down starting eating chicken tasted a bit odd, hard pieces, spit out and ate a bit more, still funny taste finished half had to stop, running juice all over table and my hands, had enough went home with the take out one for my son  On way home got sick, pulled over 3x and threw up not good  Got home son started eating his and 4 bites said it tasted odd, didn't finish. Won't ever go back"}
{"text":"I come here a lot (almost once a week) and it's sort of a hit and miss, here's why: PROS: it's fast, healthy, flavorful, filling and relatively cheap. I usually order a mucho and it is literally two meals. I cut it in half so I can take the other half for lunch the next day! The shrimp is really good and it's cooked to order.  They have also started serving queso as an option you can add which tasted sooooo good.  CONS: My favorite thing there is the shrimp burrito but they are often sold out of shrimp which is kind of annoying. Also, depending on who makes your food, you will be getting more or less. I also frequently smother my burrito and one time, the sauce had been sitting for way too long and it was crusted around the sides - that ended up on my burrito and it was disgusting. I bit down on a hard piece of something that I thought was uncooked rice, but it was pieces of blackened, hardened sauce.  So overall I like this place but sometimes..."}
{"text":"I like to come here when I want to have a quick bite to eat that tastes good, is inexpensive and filling. The service is also very fast, it's good place to go before catching a movie as, the Colossus is right next door."}
{"text":"Mucho puts together a serviceable burrito.  It's better than the Taco Bell it replaced (they changed something and while I actually used to like it, I can't say I do these days), and if you are in the food court and have a craving, it will do the job.    Burritos are pretty standard... nothing too special, but not bad either.  A little bland compared to some of the better offerings, but not offensive.  I wouldn't go to First Canadian Place specifically to get a burrito, but if you're in the food court for lunch, it is one of the better options."}
{"text":"The food here is great, fast, enjoyable and very friendly staff. The cost is great and to be honest I'd rather this than many fast food joints."}
{"text":"This is one of the latest franchises in the Mucho Burrito chain, which has restaurants across Canada and at least one in the U.S.  I would say it's slightly better than the average burrito joint in Toronto - largely because of the options available and the cleanliness compared with other places.  It's like any burrito place or Subway - line up and pick your poison as it's put together in front of you.  For about $9 I got a small (10-inch) chicken burrito and a bottle of Pepsi. Toppings included rice, pinto beans, cheese, hot sauce, onion, green pepper, jalapenos and sour cream.  Guacamole is $1 extra, but it's included if you order a mucho XL burrito, which is almost 1.5 pounds and has double the filling of a small burrito, according to the menu.  I went for lunch and the burrito tasted just fine - it really wasn't much better than most I've eaten in this city, but it was filling.  In addition to burritos you can get tacos (1 for $3, 2 for $5.60, 3 for $8), salad bowls, quesadillas, nachos or soup - all meat, veggie or fish. There's also a kids menu.  In terms of main ingredients, your options are beef, chicken, pork, steak, chorizo and tilapia, if it isn't veggie.  I'll likely be back for lunch when I need something quick or if I'm in a pinch."}
{"text":"Dropped by with a friend of mine for lunch. Decent food for price. I tried the taco salad and the burrito, both were pretty good."}
{"text":"Very good fast Mexican-esque food. I find the portions are good and you leave feeling satisfied and full. My favourite is the tilpia burrito. the only downside is when you go there and the tilapia isn't ready you have to wait 10 minutes other than that the place is very good and always tastes fresh."}
{"text":"This specific mucho burrito is beyond great. Not only are the portions very satisfying, but it is heavenly delicious. Not to mention how lovely the owner is-he was bright, cheery, and extremely friendly. He made the experience amazing for myself and my mom, due to how happy and talkative he was we would 100% go back everyday."}
{"text":"Love the taco trio. Always fresh and tasty!! Never have a problem with the service although I am a patient person."}
{"text":"My quesadilla was soggy.    On top of that, the wait was terrible as I watched 2 other couples leave the line and drive away.  The owner took one staff member with him to make deliveries while the other 2 remaining staff members struggled to keep up with the lineup that reached a maximum of 5 with an approx 15 min wait time to complete an order.  Terrible and will never go back."}
{"text":"I had a fish burrito. Pros were great size, fish was not breaded, and it was nice and crispy on the outside.  However, the flavour was bland even with added guac and shrimp, and overwhelmed by the sauce.  The price was quite high as well - over $14 for a regular burrito and a drink."}
{"text":"Probably the worst burrito I have ever had, plus the service was really slow and not very friendly."}
{"text":"This truly is as good as it gets! Let me just say, from a girl yearning for her second home in Trujillo Peru, this place is fabulous. There is something about an open air patio in Latin America that makes you relax, and Mucho Burrito brings it here to Calgary.   You walk in and know, just KNOW that the food will be fabulous. The restaurant itself is welcoming in a casual 'no pressure' way that makes you feel like you want to sit with some friends and really visit. The staff are friendly (but not awkwardly rehearsed) and explained the process of ordering to me. They have an open kitchen area and like at Subway, you have the opportunity to choose which toppings/veggis you want. FYI the taco salads are divine, and the veggi option is under $8 with tax! The best part about going to Mucho Burrito is the Dos Equis that you can enjoy with your meal. I don't often drink beer, but when I do...  Authentico!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this location for a year and always get the same things - beef burrito bowl. I opt out of a couple items (beans and veggies) and ask for lettuce instead. Today the guy put up a fuss, argued with me and said I couldn't have it as it was only for \"salads\"...seriously?! He also skimped on all the ingredients making the bowl only half sized. By the items I don't get, substituting a tiny handful of lettuce shouldn't be a big deal but apparently it's not allowed! He didn't even say it could be an extra charge he just downright said no. This is the last time I come to this location, clearly zero customer service."}
{"text":"Probably as good as it gets for burritos! I walked into this place while looking for food and it was packed (for good reason too). The lady guided me on how to order, very sweet. This location is very generous on the stuffings/toppings, food was fresh and hot! Go try it at least once! I know it's a bit pricey but you won't regret it as a once in awhile treat!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed! After my first time on Queens st, I was expecting the same thing but was totally wrong. My burrito was warm, from the rice, chicken, veggies. I asked him to put more toppings because the one downtown packed it on, and his excuse was it would be hard to wrap. Very disappointed! Staff was kinda disoriented, place is clean though. For almost $8/ burrito I'll go back downtown or save my money for something warm and fresh next time."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of \"Mexican\" or \"Tex Mex\" fast food honestly. The thought of Taco Bell makes my stomach turn, as I tried it once and was so grossed out, I vowed never to eat there again. But, Mucho Burrito has changed my perspective.   First off, the burritos are huge! I always get just a small because they're so filling (though I've had days where I've polished off a medium burrito!) They give you a variety of choices for fillings. Lots of different meat choices, as well as a few choices on the beans. I love that they have stir-fried vegetables as an option, so it's not all raw veggies going into your burrito. I also like the variety of different salsas. I tried the medium, and it was spiiiicy. Which is great, as I am a lover of spicy food. It's a bit more expensive, but seems like these days most fast food is expensive. Mucho Burrito is great value for the price.   I have also noticed they have Dos Equis if you have your meal to stay. Burritos and beer are a great combination! This is fast food that is worth trying."}
{"text":"Today was my first time eating here, I'd never heard of mucho burrito before so my girlfriend and I decided to give it a try.  We were amazed at how friendly the staff was,  the selection on the menu, the quality of the food and the size of the portions.  This place is amazing and we will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Lots of choices/options. It's a good burrito...but charging extra for guac is pretty chintzy, on what is already pretty expensive fast food."}
{"text":"Mucho Burrito offers great, much more authentic mexican food than you would get at Taco Time for example.  The burritos are substantial and a \"Mucho\" sized one can feed two people.  I really like their salads and the fact that you can completely customize everything to your exact tastes."}
{"text":"My wife and I have had great experiences at other Mucho Burrito restaurants, but not this location! We were turned off immediately by the rude service we received from the older lady working there. We received nasty looks when I politely asked for extra salsa on my burrito. The grilled vegetables looked like they were 3 weeks old. I ordered a burrito with barbacoa beef. My wife ordered a veggie quesadilla. The fridge looked picked over with little selection of drinks. Very little hot sauce available. We decided to eat in before getting on the road for 3 hours. I took 2 bites of my burrito.....just to get a mouthful of fat and grisle. I thought it might have been just been one piece, but, when I took another bite, I received the same unpleasant surprise! My wife had sour cream with her quesadilla which had the consistency of watered down glue. The restaurant isn't very clean. Upon deciding to throw our food away and go somewhere else, I noticed there was hair on our table. The garbage was overflowing. The rude woman just walked around the restaurant coughing, not covering her mouth. VERY DISGUSTING place! RUDE people! This place does not deserve anyone's business! Poor customer service. What a dirt hole!"}
{"text":"was there on a Monday the food is ok burrito is very good."}
{"text":"Best burrito I've had in a very long time!!! seriously this place reminded me of the ones in Mexico... i'd highly recommend this place to anyone looking for authentic taste.."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a quick meal. Food is great quality for a reasonable price. I eat here pretty often and I've never been disappointed with the large portions. Service is also amazing, you get what you want and more. Recommend the tacos!"}
{"text":"Alright, but definitely not the best burrito in the neighbourhood.  Ingredients were meh, and if you want  guacamole, it costs extra."}
{"text":"Ever since this new spot opened at the upper food court at First Canadian Place, I'd been meaning to try it, but was prevented by a juggernaut lineup.   Since the fuss seems to have died down significantly, i decided to try it out.   I wouldn't say I'm any sort of burrito aficionado, but I do enjoy them and have had enough of them to know what I like. I had the small carne assada burrito. Although I do commend the variety of beans and other toppings available, I must sneer at the fact that they're charging $1.00 for guacamole. Not extra guacamole, just any guacamole at all. That's chintzy, in my opinion. A little spoon of guacamole at a \"premium\" burrito place that is already charging you $7 or so for a small size burrito seems reasonable, but not at this place.   I was also rather unimpressed with the service. The young lady who took my order wasn't knowledgeable about the menu, and neither was her coworker whom she asked for help. It wasn't until the third person helping me out that I got any of my questions answered.   As for the taste of the burrito, I give it a resounding \"meh\". The meat was rather flavourless and there was no zing at all. I am used to being blown away by the spice and heat of most burrito places, so when asked if I wanted jalapeno peppers, I declined. I shouldn't have, since there wasn't much flavor on the whole. As well, the method used to heat the burrito is a clam shell type apparatus upon which the burrito sits for only a few fleeting moments. As such, the burrito isn't really warmed through very much and the cheese wasn't melted at all. The rice was also bland, which was a very bad sign since so much of the burrito filling was comprised of it.   While $7-10 isn't out of line for what one expects to pay for lunch in the financial district, I think I'll head down to Burrito Boyz the next time I have a hankering for a burrito."}
{"text":"Every time I have gone here, the staff have been very sour. They are also very skimpy on ingredients, especially the guac, which is saying something because I always order a veggie burrito which comes with free guac! I've tried it again and again, and have always been met with a degree of rudeness and poorly made burritos. The one up Deerfoot at 130th is much better; I've never had an issue with the staff and they load up the burritos!"}
{"text":"This place is Chipotle's blander sibling. There is absolutely no flavor in anything. The packaging and marketing are done pretty well. But the food had absolutely no flavor, I was really disappointed. A definite skip in my books. Burrito Boyz is still the best place I have tried."}
{"text":"I come from the town filled with Mexican food ( Chcago ) and I have to say this restaurant it's desapointing. Food taste not so good quantity for the price not good. Aswell. The place looks nicer than most Spanish places around my area that's the bottom line. Don't recomended."}
{"text":"The place is clean and the food is tasty. It has a very chipotle feel, but a bit warmer. The portions are good, and the value is average. I love that they have a more authentic flavor than most taco/burrito places."}
{"text":"The food is nothing special...and they are so stingy with the portions...I got the regular bowl rice chicken and veggies....expecting to be full and satisfied but I got out still hungry...I've been to chipotle in the states and when I ordered the regular I couldn't even finish it....and the price is not cheap...10 dollars for one spoon each of rice beans a little bit of veggies and half spoon of cheese it's a rip off...didn't take a picture but bowl was half empty....I don't want to imagine what the small looks like..hate it not coming back again..."}
{"text":"This is a go to place for my wife and I. Her staple dish is the chicken nachos. I'm all about the burritos. Normally I get the crania satta but last time I tried their sausage and it was pretty good. It's best to get it smothered!"}
{"text":"Oh burritos I love you!   Mucho is awesome - It is definitely like a Subway for Mexican food but a million times better!  The food is great, the staff are always friendly, service can get slow when they're busy but its worth the wait :)"}
{"text":"I cannot for the life of me understand why the staff has been trained to randomly pile toppings into the tortilla and then fold it into a cube before rolling it up. The result is a Russian Roulette concoction with quadrants of mild satisfaction contrasted by utter disappointment. If the meat, beans and rice toppings had some seasoning, I might endure those before arriving at the more lively quadrants; salsa, guac and cheese. But unfortunately, things like salt, pepper, cilantro and lime are hard to come by at this 'Mexican' food chain. I suspect that Mucho's chief engineer has never eaten at Mucho Burrito, because if they had, at $12 a pop, they'd call it an abomination. A Flavorless, overstuffed, overpriced, misshaped, careless, thoughtless abomination."}
{"text":"Mucho Apathy! Staff appeared to be spaced out and despondent: one star service. They weren't even remotely busy and charged extra for guac, didn't include it on the tray. (slow clap) Communication with customers in any kind of meaningful way seemed either pained or impossible. For the same price or less, just go across the street and get Chipotle who can do this kind of meal properly. The food deserves the 1 star rating, too. Bland and overpriced, not an ideal combination even for fast food."}
{"text":"There's so many options in the Eaton Centre food court dungeon (it doesn't feel like a dungeon, but it's just so far below the surface of the earth...), but I thought I'd give the burrito chain a whirl.  Had the medio pulled pork (skipped the rice, and it was still pretty filling), which was pretty tasty.  But it was damn messy, ask the folks at Mucho Burrito for extra napkins.    Another thing about this food court: could we get a napkin dispenser please?"}
{"text":"The mucho burrito tastes really good & the workers are nice. Overall, I am satisfied with the food quality and the service :)"}
{"text":"What a gem !! Just when I thought there weren't any good Mexican restaurants in Mississauga , we came across this place! Doesn't look like much from the outside but don't be discouraged. The atmosphere is casual, quaint , super clean & very cute :) But the food is what steals the show. Everything is made fresh, homemade goodness & you can taste it. Incredible flavours, very authentic not like burrito boys (ugh, yuk...fast food Mexican ). Nice sized portions . Honestly the best Mexican restaurant in the GTA I've been to. I know what true Mexican food tastes like having travelled in Mexico. So check it out because you can be sure to get a taste of some amazing & delicious Mexican fair, & be thankful you gave it a shot! We can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"being that I've been to many locations this location was beyond exquisite. They always have fresh veggie being sautéed rather than scrapping the man for every last order. I had asked the employee if they didn't mind switching their gloves as they had been dealing with meat products and I only eat halal meat and they had done so with no hesitation"}
{"text":"Food is fantastic. Prices are in line with similar places. They talk a bit fast which makes the service feel rushed but it's worth the trip in for the yumminess"}
{"text":"I can't say I have much nice things to say here...  1.  Store looks like it's closed from outside, all the time.  2.  Food is bland. Really bland. Everything tastes the same. Sure there's some heat, but there is no \"zest\".. almost like they are using bottled lime juice or something.  On the upside, the meat was nicely trimmed of fat.  No spitting out a gob of fat here.  3.  Service is chaotic.  You can tell right away the staff were not well trained, as they constantly stepped over each other, and repeatedly asked the same questions several times.  They do not cycle their bottle pop in the fridge either, so when you ask for a cold pop, you get a warm one instead that they put in the fridge only 10 minutes ago.  Obviously they can feel it when they pull it out.. how about digging in the back and getting a me cold one?  This was my first time at Mucho Burrito chain, and it wasn't a good impression."}
{"text":"What the hell. 4 stars?  I am in Toronto for a few hours and I want my friends to take me to Burrito Boys. Too much driving they say, we'll just go to mucho burrito. Whatever. Ok. I order a 10 inch chorizo burrito. The chorizo, in the heater, of course, looks like chopped up albino penis. Well, that's harsh. It looked like the dog sausage that I had in Vietnam a few months earlier. Why the chrorizo isn't shredded beats the hell out of me. I ask for it loaded with anything spicy on it. Jalapenos do actually look fresh! But everything else was bland as fuck.   I ask for Quac. Oh, that will be 99 cents. Fuck that. But yet I ask for it \"smothered\". Of course, at an outrageous upsell price of $1.50. I assume I am getting something like an enchilada, with flavorful sauce and cheese, but alas, no.   They throw the food in a disposable plastic container and charge me $35 for 3 burritos and 3 drinks. This better be fucking good. It wasn't.  The \"smothering\" sauce tasted like basic prego/marinara sauce. The entire burrito had no flavor. It tasted like a really crappy bland vegetarian burrito I could get at some federal government building cafeteria. I don't know how else I can describe the mediocrity.   Toronto is not a \"Mexican food desert\", even though 4 star reviews for a place as shitty as this probably reflects a lack of Mexican food experience. For a city with so few Mexicans, there are actually some great options. This is not one of them. This falls short even by Calgary standards."}
{"text":"Great and quick food here. Came here in between sporting events and everyone could find something they liked. The staff was very friendly and efficient. The washroom was a bit dirty but otherwise a great place - we would go back."}
{"text":"Really enjoy the fast service and great food. The portions are huge and taste really good for a fast food joint. Also have gluten free options which is a bonus for us with plenty of choices.   The staff are friendly and the seating area is clean with plenty of seating. A good place to go for lunch when you're in a hurry and don't feel like a greasy burger!"}
{"text":"I dropped by Mucho Burrito at FCP Friday afternoon hunting for lunch.  Having just eaten at two other burrito shops in the last month, I thought it'd be a good opportunity to compare.   The lineup was steady but not spectacularly busy.  You wouldn't know it from the service though.  The woman making my burrito was moving like her hair was on fire, and I don't mean that in a good way.  Fast, but uncontrolled movements resulted in my fish being broken into pieces while being removed from the tray, then flung all over the tortilla before being smashed back together with the other toppings.  The beans were quickly scooped on without giving the liquid a chance to drain through the slotted spoon.  Even well constructed burritos can be a challenge to eat at times.  I don't need a wet mess contributing to this.  Being the cautious sort, I ordered mine with a medium sauce, figuring that combined with the chipotle crust on the tilapia, there should be enough fire.  Nope.  I sensed zero hotness, the cheese was undetectable, and the burrito on the whole was bland.  Guacamole is an extra $1.  I realize that Mucho Burrito is a food court chain and perhaps not much should be expected.  But given its location in the downtown core, there are several comparable alternatives in the area which deliver vastly superior burritos."}
{"text":"Good flavour to the meat (shredded pork or beef). Love the burrito sauce! Tortilla wrap could be better."}
{"text":"I'm a burrito kind of girl. I like them a lot. Unfortunately, Mucho Burrito is nothing to get overly excited about.   Don't get me wrong - I've never had a 'bad' burrito from Mucho. But I've had a few 'so so' burritos from them...  There's just no magical 'wow' moment, you know? Luckily for Mucho, there aren't a lot of great lunch options in FCP."}
{"text":"My first Yelp review.  On a business trip in the Calgary area and came across this place.  Enjoyed this the food very much.   I got the muchoXL burrito twice.  Both were very good and had a good portion of meat which is what I like in a burrito.  Being from the US I would compare to Chipotle, Mission Burrito, or Free Birds in case you are familiar with those places.    Pros - good portions and great tasting.  Cons - a bit pricey when compared to the US equivalents but I am guessing a fair price for the locals.  Also on my first visit (about 4pm on a Sunday) they were running out of Carne Asada and a few other items.  I will plan on making it a regular stop when I am in town."}
{"text":"Definetly a great place to go if you have a real hankering for mexican food. Prices are fairly reasonable amd service is fast and good. The food is great and the store is clean and has plenty of tables. If in the area again and I'm hungry, I would probably revisit."}
{"text":"This Mucho Burrito is awesome. I go about once every 2 weeks. The staff is super friendly and they make a really good Tilapia burrito."}
{"text":"Whole wheat tortillas is an automatic 5 stars in my book! Nice little patio area, fun music, and SO TASTY. Staff was fast and friendly. I have every intention of coming back!"}
{"text":"This place is #1... They do not cheap out on the meat like the other burrito places do..huge tasty burrito right here don't waste your time going anywhere else"}
{"text":"I come to this Mucho I would assume no less than once a week and sometimes two or three.  Very good food. Quick service and helpful staf. I always get the exact same burrito and it's gotten to where some of the staff know what I'm getting when I walk in.  The only complaint I have is that how good your experience is, has a very heavy basis on who makes your burritos. I've had both good and bad burritos from this location purely because some of the staff seem to put more care into it than others. It's the little things like someone going back and adding a bit more rice or a touch more meat because I don't get beans or vegetables on my burrito.  All and all though, the igredients are always fresh. The building is always clean, the staff is always friendly and quick and far and away the burritos are amazing much more than they're subpar.  Average burrito: Regular on white with white rice, shredded beef, cheese, sour cream, jalapeños and burrito sauce."}
{"text":"The staff doesn't read promotions and make their own rules as they see fit. The cookies are good."}
{"text":"I really like this location! Better than other Mucho burritos I've been to. Never disappointed with the service or food and I come here often with my family for quick takeaway."}
{"text":"Our family loves this place. We tried several Mexican fast food places in Canada and by far this is the best. The ingredients are always fresh and food is delicious. My favourite is vegetarian burrito."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this Mucho Burrito location for fast and healthy take out for over six months now, and this place has become one of my top five go-to restaurants for meals when I am too tired to prepare something for myself at home. As far as take-out Mexican meals go, I find that this is one of the better places to visit in North Whitby as the ingredients this location uses are fresh and well prepared in comparison to other chains like Jimmy Guacos where the salads look tired and wilted.   If you're eating in, you'll enjoy the many TVs set up that are usually playing a sporting game or two (I watched one of the world cup games here) and seating is wide enough to accommodate families and anyone with any accessibility needs. Service from staff is hit and miss. I've had great interactions with the younger staff that are cheerful and always up for a chat as they prepare my meal, whereas some of the older staff can be a lot colder towards customers and not as helpful with choosing menu items.  As far as their sweets go, it is as another commenter has mentioned here - most of the times its stale and the Mexican brownie recipe varies widely from one day to the next. One week that I visited the brownie had so much chilli added that I noticed it (I usually order spicy dishes to give you an idea of the level of spiciness) and on another day that I visited I noticed there was no chilli in the recipe at all.   I am giving this restaurant a 3/5 because while it was my favourite place to visit for a while, stingy management has had a big effect on their food as of late. Staff are noticeably light handed on serving ingredients in any of the meals (watch for this as you are getting served) and the brownies are nowhere near the same portion size as they were two months ago. You'd be lucky to get a 1\" x 1\" square compared to the 3\" x 2\" that they used to serve. Go for the fresh ingredients, but beware the smaller than average portion sizes."}
{"text":"Friendly staff! Food portions are good as compared to other locations. Their pico de gallo is always on point and guac is always green which is great! The mucho is as big as my forearm which is great for something worth 12$. I think its nice how they sauté veggies as they serve it."}
{"text":"Imagine Subway made awesome burritos instead. You start with either whole wheat or white flour burrito wraps in a variety of sizes. Pick either white or Mexican rice, then brown or black beans. There's some fried vegetables, and a variety of meats. I suppose there's some cheeses to pick from, but I went with none-of-the-above. Salsa, hot sauces, a corn salad, cilantro, and then wrap it all up and grill it. I'm sure I missed half the ingredients they offer.  Even with a lineup on a Friday evening service was quick and the resulting burrito was awesome."}
{"text":"I would give it 0 rating if it is available. I ordered a vege burrito bowl and was given just half a bowl. I asked for more and was given \"David Copperfield\" treatment!"}
{"text":"Burrito yes please!  Every visit to this location has been a positive experience both eat-in and take-out.  Staff is very friendly and accommodating for dietary requirements and also for just preference.  Quality is alway very high and fresh.  Meat is always cooked properly and he portions are almost two big. If you can handle heat get the ghost pepper sauce, it's amazing! If you can't - stay away from it; it will melt your face off!"}
{"text":"Since the opening last year, I've been to this location a few times and thought this was time to write my own review based on what I have seen so far. As expected, they have good quality ingredients for a fast food restaurant. Portions are FAIR, you can't add more ingredients in the burrito or it will not close properly and spread your lunch all over the place on the first bite. If you want to eat like a pig, bigger portions are available. I am 200lbs and a small burrito with their well calculated portions is quite enough for a big guy like me.  Be careful with spicy sauce  if you are not too tolerant. Since its opening I have noticed the kitchen is not as clean as it was. Fingerprints all over the stainless steel, fans, etc. Some containers are empty of ingredients despite a quiet afternoon.  Toilets and tables were clean. Good ambiance Mexican music from Bose speakers. Keep it up."}
{"text":"I often eat at Mucho. First time at this location and will be my last sadly. I got the three tacos and ordered two beef and one chorizo.  The fella who was doing the order loaded my one with pork which was super wet..yuck. When I said I didn't order pork he just scooped it out and left everything soggy. By the time I went across to the lab to have my dinner it was discusting and all wet I had to throw it all out."}
{"text":"Ordered a chicken burrito with chips & salsa, and 2 churros. The burrito itself was good at first but the more I ate the more sour it became. I got their hot salsa which was just too acidic for me, and it was all I could taste. I opted for mild salsa with the chips, which was oddly sweet.    The churros took about 5 minutes to arrive. They were fairly good but slightly stale.    This is the first time I haven't been able to finish a burrito. Maybe I've just eaten too much Chipotle, but I don't think I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Only in a real pinch.  At the first bite my brain said \"There is something seriously wrong here.\"  If you have had Burrito Boyz or any of the more serious downtown  burritos, this place is really really pale by comparison. At BB it takes 15m to prepare an item. That's because they cook basically to order. And you get this hot filling + cool garnishes. It all works.  And look at the BB kitchen - there is usually a pile of whole tomatoes waiting to be chopped.   Here it felt mushy and tasted floury. Of course what did I expect, they serve it basically cold with premade fillings just ladled out. Yes the ingredients seemed fresh enough, but it just doesn't work altogether. I expect garnishes here are poured out of containers from head office. This is chain food gone amok.  (To the one reviewer who said \"OMG...the most delish burritos in Leaside. \" Well, that is not saying much. Leaside is not known for their discriminating taste in Burritos.)  and it got very expensive. At BB you can get out of there for $6 to $8 pp and guac is standard. at MB, guac is extra and you come in at about... $12 pp.   Again, only if you are absolutely stuck."}
{"text":"Meh Reasonable. Healthy alternative to a lot of fast foods. Veggie Tacos were good though the rice was abundant and relatively tasteless. Not a bad option if you get stuck in the wasteland of Laird and Eglinton."}
{"text":"Couldn't believe how big the mucho size burrito was. Good flavour. Super fast in and out if you're in a hurry. We had the chorizo. Can't wait to try the others."}
{"text":"Decent burritos, incredible customer service. Consistently going above and beyond, they visibly work to go the extra mile."}
{"text":"Great food for a good price! And....awesome portion sizes!!"}
{"text":"Fast, easy and inexpensive...just the way a burrito should be, and this is what \"fast food\" should be.  Food quality is great, service is fast and friendly and it's licensed, so you can even have a Corona if you so desire.  I usually just swing in for a great, fast burrito.  You walk up to the counter, tell them the size, pick your fillings and you're minutes away from a delicious burrito.  The ingredients are all fresh and right under glass for you to see.   The meat is real and you can tell what it is without guessing.  No meat paste or any of that other sh!t that your body will expunge withing minutes of ingesting.  Nothing is pre-made.  If you think Taco Bell is Mexican food, you're wrong.  This is as close to an authentic burrito as you're going to get without searching the GTA for a \"real\" Mexican restaurant.    Sizes are small, medium and mucho burrito.  I'd say medium is more than enough for most.  I like a nice case of the \"itis\" after eating, so I always opt for mucho...it's around $10.99 and worth every penny.  After recommending the restaurant to my brother he went with the mucho burrito and commented that he felt like they'd put a newborn baby on his tray...6 pounds, 7 ounces of delicious burrito."}
{"text":"There seems to be a bunch of new American chains popping up in Mississauga. Last night, I visited Mucho Burrito in the north end of the city. Walking in you get trendy yet relaxing vibe of the burrito trend; I really liked the lighting at this location.   On to the food, I order two tacos, I stayed away from the burrito because I was mildly hungry versus burrito hungry. The nice thing was that they had various burrito sizes you could order, how convenient!! I got the pollo (chicken), huge chucks of chicken, they were a bit dry but I appreciated the protein. The sad part was they were out of lettuce, how a fast food place can be out of lettuce baffles me but I was offered grilled veggies instead.   The tacos were decent, much better than taco bell, they were fresh and tasty. I would like to try out their burritos the next time I am in the area.   Check out a Mucho Burrito close to you!"}
{"text":"Ghost Pepper Burrito!!!!!!!    When Mike and I first heard the Mucho Burrito ads for the Ghost Pepper Burrito, he was excited and I was skeptical.  There are a lot of fast food places laying claim to some sort of flame-throwing super-spicy feature item that ends up having the heat of watered down frank's hot sauce.  Lame.  Well, Mucho Burrito proved me wrong.  Mike LOVES spicy food, and he declared the Ghost Pepper Burrito (Hotter than Hell version) a great success, with a perfect level of spice.  It was made with actual Bhut Jolokia Ghost Peppers, which clock in at 1 million scoville units.  I couldn't eat it, but I'm a wimp like that.  One of his co-workers fought through tears to finish it.  There was a \"wimpy\" version, but I opted to try the tacos instead.  The pork carnitas meat was an excellent choice, and the my chicken taco was also well-seasoned. Mucho Burrito certainly isn't an authentic hole-in-the-wall mexican joint, but for a fast food franchise they put out some decent food.  Plus they are licenced, so you can enjoy a Dos Equis or a Tecate with your burrito.  Apparently the Ghost Pepper Burrito was a promotional item which ended on Halloween, so hopefully they bring it back again soon.    Review #4 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012"}
{"text":"This was my first and last time having Mucho Burrito. I ordered a regular size chicken burrito without rice. I did ask for extra beans because I could see the chicken she put on my burrito was pretty skimpy. As soon as I bit into this burrito, I knew it was not going to be a good burrito experience.  The tortilla had that wet, rubbery, raw taste and texture to it. So off-putting. I wish they would grill the tortilla more before they filled it so the insides would lose that rubbery texture. There was a taste of something being off in my burrito. It only took me a moment to discover that it was the guacamole. How old is it? It didn't look nice and green so I suppose it's on me for even saying yes when she asked if I wanted guac. It tasted bad. That old guac taste permeated my burrito and made it hard to enjoy.   The bites without the old guac were pretty flavourless unless I managed to get some of the hot salsa (which is pretty good) or the fresh jalapenos (which they skimped out on and I had to ask for more). The chicken was dry and pretty flavourless.  The service was rather miserable. You do not get to give me a bad burrito and bad service and expect me to come back. No, siree. Also, my \"regular\" chicken was 12 bucks (no sides, no drink). Is that right? Was I ripped off? I felt ripped off. Definitely not worth 12 bucks."}
{"text":"Great food. Fast friendly service. We eat here at least one a week. Fish veggie and chicken burritos are our favorites. Tacos are good as well. Far superior to other mucho burritos in area."}
{"text":"This is by far the BEST Mucho Burrito location. I've always had awesome friendly and quick service. The drive thru is the best thing ever (mom with small kids). I've been served a few times by the Mexican owner and he's funny, friendly and His staff all seem happy to be there. They have this massaging/ mixing technique that they do and I swear that's all the difference in why the burritos at this location are that much better."}
{"text":"One of the few that has fish on the menu. Tilapia cooked fresh and added to any burrito or taco. Great place for a quick Mexican fix."}
{"text":"Mucho Burrito is just delicious. I find some locations are a hit or miss. Love this location as it is constantly consistent with their flavours."}
{"text":"The food is really disgusting.  I'm a huge quesada fan, and I ran accross mucho burrito today and decided to try it. I figured since both restaurants are based on a similar concept (choosing ingredients) that it would be good.  This restaurant doesn't compare. I ordered a burrito bowl with pulled pork. I ate two bites and threw out the food. It was terrible! I felt sick a few hours later, and that was from a couple of bites, I cant even imagine what would have happeedn if I ate all of it.  I highly recommend that you avoid this restaurant.  I will never return there again.  Also like many others have said, they are very cheap on portions, the 11$ bowl was 1/3 filled.   Save yourself the time, money and bad taste and do not go here."}
{"text":"Never going back! Worst Burrito I had for almost 11 bugs! Worst Customer Service: Had to mention 'Chicken' 4 times to confirm the meat on my Burrito....."}
{"text":"Generally good. I would stick with their tacos unless you are really hungry. Then get a small burrito."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times when I want to grab a bite on the way to the cottage. This place always looks pretty clean but all the times I've eaten here it was a ghost town. Maybe 1 or 2 customers come in. I don't mind because I get my food that much faster!  I really love how they have different options in sizing for their burritos! I've always felt it was a waste when I don't finish a burrito I've gotten at other places. They have various options for their menu from the meat, to the style, and the filling! When they roll it all up, they put it on a grill press to heat it up a bit. I'm not always the biggest fan of grilled burritos but I honestly don't have any complaints. This will definitely be a go to place to eat for a quick bite on the way to or from the cottage."}
{"text":"J'ai adoré ce restaurant !! La nourriture est délicieuse et le service est excellent !! C'était notre première fois dans ce restaurant et on nous a accueilli de façon exceptionnelle. C'est sur qu'on va revenir. P.S. Les churros sont trop bons !!"}
{"text":"I use to think this place was okay.  I came here this past Tuesday, and on the way in noticed a sign that said kids eat free. (Bonus), we were coming here for supper anyway. I ordered two taco's, one pork and one chicken.  I have to say that they are pretty darn skimpy on the pork/chicken. My wife ordered a single beef taco. Then we ordered off the kids menu, for the boys. I paid by debit, and sat at one of the booths. I looked at the receipt, and the the total came to $27.00 and change.  ( forgot to add the boys both had plain quesadillas ). Just cheese on both. I thought wait a minute, that sounds like a lot for 3 tacos and a pop. I took the receipt up to the front to show  one of the ladies, and noticed the kids meals weren't free. The lady at the front, told me that kids burritos were free not Quesadilla's. I thought this was a little odd since the Quesadilla's were $3.99, and the kids burrito's were more expensive at $4.99.  Oh well, rules are rules. I guess I should've read the small print under the huge ones that read KIDS EAT FREE.  The two ladies that were working here, just didn't seem to want to be there.  I won't be back to this location :-("}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times. The food was okay. The prices were okay, but I am not inspired to return soon. The staff was friendly, helpful and patient with me while I asked questions and took my time deciding. I do not care for the music that they blast outside the restaurant. This is a bland sterile franchise. It does not feel like Mexico and it's trying too hard. I can understand that some might give it a 4 or 5 but it is not my thing."}
{"text":"One of my fave places to eat for a quick, fresh, filling meal when I lived in the US was Chipotle.  I was very sad when I moved to Calgary b/c, alas, no Chipotle.  Now, I am less sad because Mucho Burrito to the rescue!  With the choice of burritos, tacos, salad bowls there are lots of choices for everyone in your group.  I am partial to the carnitas burrito on a whole wheat tortilla with rice, fajita veggies, medium salsa, corn salsa & sour cream.  Oh so good!  Definitely worth a try....it is head and shoulders above most fast food & at around the same price point."}
{"text":"Best in Vaudreuil! tried Quesada across the 40 but Mucho Burrito rocks!, everything is fresh, more selection and great service!"}
{"text":"Coming from the US, places like this are everywhere. We have massive chains like Baja Fresh, Moe's, Salsarita's, Chipolte, etc. Mucho Burrito rivals them all. It's a great place to come grab a burrito when you are low on time. Even when there's a line it moves quickly the the meats are pretty good, none are boring and bland. It's also very affordable."}
{"text":"Good food but EXTREMELY stingy on the meat. I've been to many locations and it's all the same. I guess they try to save money? Go to Gringo Burrito, they will give you a mountain of meat. Like 3 times the meat at the same cost."}
{"text":"Yummy! But whatever you do, don't get the marinara sauce added. It have no flavour and kills the entire burrito. I literally wiped it all off and enjoyed it the way it should be. I come here whenever I'm in the area and it does not disappoint."}
{"text":"It was so pricey! I got a small burrito with gauc and it came up to $10! Holy!  They were very stingy about everything, I asked for some extra sauce and they said it's extra and then gauc (a spoonful is $1 extra). I can buy a bag of 5 avocados for $3!  Anyway, it was barely enough and it was pricey. The burrito was soggy! Gross. I suggest avoiding Mucho Burrito, you can definitely get your bang for your buck elsewhere!   Service was quick, so there's your star."}
{"text":"Five stars for the friendly service and freshness of ingredients. I got a steak taco salad and was pleased with the generous helping of steak and guacamole! The salad is a very large portion."}
{"text":"Great service with hot and fresh food. It was a solid experience. My only complaint would be that my quesadilla didn't have the dips I was expecting ( the salsa & sour cream) The quesadilla itself was tastey though!"}
{"text":"Burritos are the new Sushi. Heavy on the kitsch, Mucho Burrito appears to be a Chipotle-wannabe. I like the options, including tacos, salads and the mainstay burrito. Good option to have a whole wheat tortilla, but I found the ingredients a little dry. Not sure when they opened, but it was recently.  I'll take my burrito-connoseur friends and see what they think, for sure.  For the veggie options, there isn't a 'fake meat option', but they do have a pan-seared  fish that I'm dying to try next time.  Goodbye Sushi, Hello Mucho Burrito."}
{"text":"Ordered a large set of group meal for a team lunch. Restaurant took preorder to have individual items made to each liking, and ready by pickup time. Can't control the temperature and the liquid content by the time arrive, but great service and meal. Would  order team lunch again, for its great service. Got the tilapia and it was still juicy upon arrival, 15 min away from store"}
{"text":"My friend and I went to this Mucho Burrito for our lunch as we work near by, and I have to say it was overall very disappointing. I had hard tacos and she has a quesadilla. For my meat I chose the steak as it looked like it was the \"freshest\" meat to choose from. Toppings of choice were lettuce, pico de gallo, sour cream, cheese and cilantro. I was really looking forward to this as my last experience here was sub par also. First mistake was that I got hard tacos, second mistake is I took them to-go. By the time I got back to work my tacos were cold and soggy. The steak was dry and over cooked, and my tacos literally fell apart. My friends quesadilla was also cold and soggy when we got back. Needles to say neither of us were very disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food, ingredients and service! Very great fast casual and nice array of food including vegetarian options. Merci Mucho Burrito!"}
{"text":"Mucho Burrito c'est bon, mais pas dingue... Ca reste avant tout du fast food tex-mex. La qualité des produits est correcte sans plus. Le choix étant très limité pour manger dans le quartier, j'y viens de temps en temps faute de mieux. Le service est plutôt bon."}
{"text":"Horrible and disgusting.  The tacos were cold, the cheese moldy, the hot sauce tasteless and watery, the soft tacos were dry and cracking because they were stale.  Also the price is insultingly high.  You'll get better food at taco time. Or dare I say it- Taco Bell.  You should stay away and not bother or you and your stomach (and wallet) will regret this disgusting place."}
{"text":"I came on here to prevent people from wasting their money and getting upset like I did! How is this place in business??  Came here on my lunch break, the cashier was terrible and looked like she either just took a nap in the back or her cat ran away... ordered the 3 tacos for $9... not a bad price right?   While the server is making the tacos she mumbles something that resembles the word guacamole and I say yes and notice the 50 cent guac sign. again, not bad.   They put NOTHING on your taco... no corn, no tomatoes... just the meat of your choice, cheese, and salsa. EVERYTHING is extra. Get to the cash... $13. I was charged 3 times... 3 tacos x 50c = $1.50. for 3 tiny tacos. on top of this I walked all of 5 minutes back to my office and they were SOAKED. the hard taco wasnt even hard anymore, no crunch because everything had turned to mush. they soaked through tin foil, a layer of napkins, a brown paper bag and onto my pants....  everything about this place is brutal. $15 can get you a plate of tacos at a real mexican restaurant, $13 can get you mush apparently. normally i would just never go back but this place needs a warning, straight UP"}
{"text":"As I lived in Southern California for 15 years, I am ultra critical when it comes to Mexican Cuisine. However Mucho Burrito reminds me of a great place in California called La Salsa.  They have the same value for fresh ingredients and romantic flavours.  This place rocks and priced well for the quality."}
{"text":"It's a good concept but there are problems. The ingredients are fresh & appear to be made in house. The staff seemed reluctant to actually make my burrito. Their supposedly really hot sauce was watered down. The sour creme was a white runny coloured water. The rice seemed ok The carne was cooked  Was it worth the almost $20 I spent ? No it wasn't Will I be back ? No I won't  I can get a much better product @ Chipotle for the same $"}
{"text":"Came here to meet a friend for lunch.  I didn't expect too much as I had a bad experience at another Mucho Burrito in the east end.  The burrito I had there was tiny, soggy and tasteless.  I figure we would give this one a try since there wasn't much in this plaza.  I ordered the regular meat burrito.  You can pick pull pork, chicken, and some other meat that was drenched in sauce.  I went with the less sodium infused option which I think was the chicken.  I also got them to put it on whole wheat and also got the brown rice.  They charge extra for quac but it didn't look too good so I told them not to put it on.  I also had them put in some jalapeno peppers which I expected to be spicy but it was not at all.  Once they wrapped up my burrito, it did look like the increased the portion sizes a bit because I don't remember the burrito looking like that at the other place.  The servers were friendly and very quick.  The portion was fine but I still think they can improve on taste.  It still wasn't that tasty, maybe it was the lack of spices.  I like Mexican food but this places just doesn't cut it for me.  I'll give it 3 stars for being okay as it did fill me up but definitely lacked taste."}
{"text":"I'm not even remotely concerned about going out on a limb when I say that this place makes THE best burrito in town. Fer rizzle.  First of all, I love that there are ONLY two Mucho Burritos in all of Calgary. It ensures you don't take this place for granted.  From the parking lot you can hear the Latino beats beckoning your name. It took a total of 5 seconds for me to cave and decide I was going to have an entire burrito...as a 'snack'.  You walk in, and the place is spacious and welcoming. All the customers have happy looks on their faces and it's clear why: they are eating THE best burritos in Calgary. Wouldn't YOU be a happy camper?   For all you Americans, picture Chipotle. For all your Canadians, picture Subway (burrito-style).  I get to the front and place my order. I basically meet the entire staff through the customization of my burrito.   The staff is friendly, the ingredients are fresh, and my burrito is DE-LISH.  If you're not a burrito hound like me, then they've got Quesadillas, gourmet tacos, nachos, salad bowls and Pequenitos (petite sized servings for you amateur eaters).  I LOVED the ambiance, I LOVED the music and I LOVED my meal.  You wanna get in my good books? Take me on a date at Mucho Burrito. I may be a cheap date (burrito - $4.99!), but I ain't cheap. Nothing but the best for this mamita."}
{"text":"The most not authentic Mexican meal. I felt ill for two hours after probably from bad meat. Tacos awful and food was cold. I would not recommend"}
{"text":"Hola amigos! If there is one thing that I love more than anything for lunch its a little taste of Mexican food. In the York Region its hard to find places that consistently produce freshly made, tasty, Mexican. I mean there is always Taco Bell, but that place is to Mexican food what Olive Garden is to Italian *Barf*  Mucho Burrito is located  in the Rio-Can Colossus plaza on HWY 7 in Woodbridge and although one would consider this place \"fast food\" I would argue that the fresh ingredients and made to order meals, put this on the healthier side of things.  I have been here several times and I love the upbeat music and atmosphere almost as much as I love their food. On my latest visit I ordered the Medium pulled pork burrito (Carnitas) with: rice, grilled veggies, pico de gallo, hot sauce, burrito sauce, guacamole, cheese, and sour cream.  I consider myself to have a hearty appetite and the medium is more than enough, so if you feel you can wrangle the MUCHO size, I tip my hat to you sir/madam - its HUGE. The medium with water and an extra charge for guacamole my meal came to just under $12 - not a bad deal for lunch.  This is great Mexican alternative to grabbing a submarine sandwich, I felt comfortably full and my taste buds were tickled. I'll be back any time I am feeling like sending my taste buds south of the border while in Vaughan."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced, quick and really good for fast food. I was impressed that everything is fresh and made to order.   Excellent value and will be back when I am craving some Mexican food."}
{"text":"Pretty reliable chain. Consistently delivers a good, healthy product. However this location can be a little lacklustre at times. Staff seem overly micromanaged and occasionally chips and cookies are stale."}
{"text":"Good burritos, great staff.  I've been to a couple of other locations, and this one is by far the best.  It's owned by a couple of young guys my age, which I think is really cool so I like to support this location.  I actually live closer to the Quarry Park location, but I drive past that one to get to this one (quarry park location skimps on ingredients)."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday around noon and it wasn't too busy. Service was still very slow. They're Decently priced but compared to other burrito chains they've got a long way to go."}
{"text":"i go here all the time and love it. guys are straight forward and pack a mean burrito. fresh ingredients, a little pricey but worth it.  i always get a beer"}
{"text":"Not a huge fan of the food, but I do love the service here. I've been to this location a few times, and each time, the employees were courteous, professional, and had a smile on their face."}
{"text":"significantly less portion than other mucho burrito's. also asked for tortilla on the side, they dont even warm it up. they fold it and put it directly in the bowl. what's up with that bro. would not recommend out of 10"}
{"text":"Just had this and was amazing. I got the Mucho XL and it was huge! It was fresh and really tasty."}
{"text":"Great value here!  Delicious, fresh ingredients and lots of them, including heaps of fresh guacamole.  None of this pay a million dollars extra crap like at Subway.  The ingredients are also noticeably fresh and delicious.  There aren't any \"barely-soft-enough-for-us-to-call-them-food\" tomatoes that so frequently show up in fast food and should be repurposed as baseballs and road hockey balls; these veggies taste like delicious, fresh veggies! A \"mucho\" size burrito is a small lunch for two people and sets you back all of $11.50, a steal for the volume of food. My spouse loves the flavourful, well cooked rice, that isn't like chewing on cat litter filler in a wrap. All in all, a big thumbs up, if it didn't take two  hands to hold the monster burrito!"}
{"text":"Eh... Food is alright. Definitely not an authentic. On the higher end of the spectrum dollar wise. For what you pay, I would expect I higher quality meal."}
{"text":"I love this Mucho Burrito location, it's very clean and cosy. There are many vegetarian options available which is always a good thing. I love the drinks they offer, they're different from the typical coke/Pepsi etc. Would recommend it again."}
{"text":"This should be renamed to \"Mediocre Burrito\". Do you like paying $14 for a veggie burrito bowl? Go here. Do you like getting charged $2 for \"extra\" cheese? Go here. Do you like paying for every small scoop of corn? Go here."}
{"text":"The food is just okay. Person who waited on us was less than friendly. Very little meat in the bowls, mostly rice. Would look elsewhere before I came back. Tables were dirty, sticky. The do not have fountain drinks."}
{"text":"Wow ... they now have a new vegetarian option: premium veggie mix consisting of butternut squash, chayote squash, sweet potato, edamame, corn, portobello mushroom, ancho chile and agave marinade. Carb heavy but delicious ... hurray for more veggie options.  There is a choice of bowl if you want less carbs.  I asked for my burrito without rice and cheese and it still weighed almost as much as mr leny's fully loaded meat one.  Thanks Mucho!"}
{"text":"I had the chance to try out Mucho Burrito for lunch the other day, and was very happy!  Now that I'm working in the boonies, I'm trying to discover all kinds of new, tasty and affordable places to eat at. This one hit a home run for me!  I had two tacos.. One with shredded beef with the hot salsa, and one with crusted tilapia with guacamole... Both were delicious!! I wish they used two little tortilla shells instead of one because the salsa was making the shell soggy, but its okay. For good quality flavourful tacos, I will forgive! Once I was done my two tacos, I started regretting not getting more..  My coworkers had a burrito and a quesadilla, and both seemed to enjoy it!  The service was friendly and quick, and the place was not packed. Definitely a great place to go for tacos if you're in the deep South!"}
{"text":"I ordered the burrito bowl. The fact that I had to repeatedly ask for extra vegetables, salsa, and to include cilantro, corn and lettuce made me feel picky. I'm not- I just wanted something besides meat. The guy wasn't really into my requests so it was literally a few corn kernels and a tiny sprinkle of cilantro. It didn't taste like much of anything. Except bad. I had chicken the first time- and pork the second. The second time I through out half my lunch because it just grossed me out. I shoulda learned after the first time. My lunch cost me (including a bottle of cranberry juice and a thimble of guacamole) was $15.  They're cheap on the ingredients and it tastes bad. I won't return."}
{"text":"I've been a couple of times when I feel like sneaking away from work for a change in lunch. This place has a great menu, reasonable prices and a good variety of hit, medium and mild foods. The only complaint I have of this place is that, depending on who is fixing your burrito, you are either going to get generous fixings or very little. It's never consistent I find.   That aside, definitely a recommended 'quick grab' kind of place."}
{"text":"I like mucho. But the portions here were ridiculously small. I asked for lettuce and literally got one leaf!  Lol"}
{"text":"Barely edible, not on my do again list. Limited menu and poorly run knock off of big fat burrito and not even close. The only Mexican was the man cleaning the windows."}
{"text":"Good portions, delicious food, wish they weren't always out of fish for the fish tacos :("}
{"text":"What the hell does everyone see in this place? I don't care if it's a franchise and it sure as hell beats taco bell, but this is place is not good... at all. I went at lunch time it was about 3/4 full and I thought it must be good since it's busy (I didn't know it was a franchise at the time). I opted for  the 10' fish burrito, black bean and corn salsa, cucumber and burrito sauce. The total was around $9, not too much about 5x more than taco bell but average for a regular Mexican place. This place, however was not average not even close it was down right crap. The cilantro was so overpowering I left half of it, the talapia was very fishy and dry (odd because it's mild fish, suggesting it had been left out for a long time) and the burrito was not even warmed through. The cashier was snooty as if he was running Per se or something? What the hell you make 10.25/hr get of your high horse. Mexico Lindo is much better option!"}
{"text":"Good food, clean place, friendly staff. A bit expensive but at least it fills you up. Ingredients are fresh and guac is good. Can't ask for much more."}
{"text":"With each day that passes, my lust for burritos becomes more and more apparent. So, imagine my joy when I randomly drove past Mucho Burrito, a burrito joint that I hadn't tried yet. I wasn't expecting authenticity like many others scathe the chains for, but I was hoping for something tasty.  I give the place kudos for cleanliness. While I wasn't eating there, I certainly appreciated how presentable the place was, though dead at the time.  The woman serving me was little help. Being that there are 2 menu signs, one to your left, and one behind the server, it's confusing for a newb. Despite the fact that I was the only customer at that moment, I felt like I was seriously being rushed, and I didn't care for it at all. I quickly decided on a mucho burrito with chicken and steak, and before I could even start specifying my toppings, she dumped about six pounds of rice on it. I don't normally get rice, but I'm no ricist, so I let it slide. I picked out my usual suspect toppings, and anticipated the wait time while the burrito would be cooked. Hah, nope. She hands it to me as soon as the last topping was on. I suppose the toppings are kept warm in their stainless dungeons, and that may explain why the toppings didn't look all that fresh or inviting. The price was right (slightly more burrito than you would get for the same price at Burrito Boyz), but I was too suspicious of my new burrito friend to care.  Sure enough, not a damn thing stood out with this burrito. Every single topping was bland, and certainly not worth 10 bucks. In fact, I'd go so far as to say that Taco Bell's burritos are miles better than this lame-ass place, and that says a LOT.  And to add to the experience, some hours after consumption, I ended up a complete pukey mess. It took a few hours for the hell-wrap to vacate the premises, but it was enough damage to make my stomach sick for the next day as well. And to kick vagueness to the curb, I didn't eat or drink anything else that day, just water and this poor excuse for a 2nd rate option of a Mexican food lover's meal. Mucho Burrito is mucho no es bueno! Aye chihuahua!  Bonus kick in the cajones: I figured assigning my first ever 1-star review on Yelp was going to make me feel bad for whoever I was giving it to, but I draw the line at making me physically ill. Congrats, MB, you sub-par burrito putas get the \"EEK!\""}
{"text":"Not much to say about this location specifically. The food is good - which is the same as other locations. This is one of my favorite places for a burrito! Must try if you are poking around for a Mexican place for lunch."}
{"text":"Kudos to this location for having Beer and Wine! But if I'm down this end of Queen there are far better choices for dinner/lunch and a drink.  While the food is mostly ok, itends up being very expensive for a fast food chain. The amount of food is fine, but the quality for the price is just not there.  *Points for playing awesome Mexican music that makes me wiggle around on my bike seat in an attempt to dance when I cycle by."}
{"text":"Besides being overpriced and not that great, the service here was abysmal. So the guy took my order and I wanted a burrito but no rice or beans. He looked at me like I was nuts. Yeah, I get that it will be smaller than normal, but I don't like rice or beans and prefer extra lettuce or something crunchy.  The reason that I even went to this place was because I was in a rush and really hungry. Finally, they guy assembled my burrito and handed put it on a tray. He rang it up for $9.95. I handed him a 10 and he turned his back on me and started chatting and laughing with a co worker. I stood there, hangry and in complete disbelief that I was being ignored with money in my hand. He kept on yakking even when I politely said \"excuse me..\".  Finally, my patience had worn thin and I was ready to skin the dude alive:  \"Can I pay for my damn burrito and be on my way?\"  \"Oh, sorry\", he replied, as though I was interrupting his social break time or something.  After all that the burrito was mediocre.  I don't want to have to fight for my food. Especially when I'm paying for it."}
{"text":"Amazing Mexican food!! We are from Arizona and this place hit the spot on our trip to Calgary. The hot sauce was amazing!! The burritos were delicious and I liked that you can pick your size of burrito. The guacamole was a must have your burrito. Super good!!"}
{"text":"1/30 - April Challenge  I agree, the staff here: Much friendlier and far more generous than their Quarry Park counterpart. When I ask for two salsas at Quarry Park, I get a bored, glassy eyed, \"we have to charge you extra for that\" reply. Here, you can have whatever you like! And! The staff isn't confused here when you order as per the menu's Spanish descriptions. Both locations are about equal driving distance from where I am, so I think I'll frequent this location from now on. If they were open late (which is usually when I REALLY want a burrito), I'd probably haunt them on a daily basis.   I always get the same thing: Vegetarian Burrito with black beans (either pequeño or medio, depending on how hungry I am!); minus the white rice, cheese and sour cream (which is why I'll ask for two salsas). Pro-tip: the hot salsa ain't nothing to fuck with. It's tasty as hell, though, so I always get it. If you're unsure, the guys behind the counter have no problem letting you sample it first. The lady in front of me that asked for a sample, started sweating almost immediately. The burritos come with roasted bell peppers, the salsa of your choice, diced jalapeños and chopped cilantro. Everything tastes fresh and homey.   A nutritional guide is available on their website, though I wish an off button was available for the autoplay music that comes on :-|."}
{"text":"16/30  One day, Calgary will open up a Rubio's or a Chipotle and then I'll be happy. Until then, we have Mucho Burrito. Mucho Burrito is actually on the surprisingly delicious end of the long line of very sad \"Mexican\" restaurants we have here. Everything is freshly prepared (\"Mexican\" restaurants! Take note!), and sometimes they have awesome deals like $5 Burrito Medio on Cinco de Mayo. Minus points though, because sometimes you'll ask for a Pequeño Veggie Burrito and the staff will gawk at you like you grew an extra face. They'll keep staring at you until you say \"small,\" and then they'll snap back to life. Hey, I wasn't doing it to be a jerk! The menu says \"pequeño!\"  If this place opened up a complimentary (with purchase) salsa bar like its American counterparts, they'd be on their way to being a decent pseudo-taqueria. Until then, just order a bigger burrito! Just make sure you don't try to score Latino points by attempting to order in Spanish ;)."}
{"text":"Mucho Burrito may not have the most authentic tasting food, but this place is a win for me. What it lacks in authenticity, it makes up for with fresh ingredients; a hot sauce that brings tears of endorphin-laced joy; and the nicest staff ever. Whenever I come in, they always remember me, they greet me with genuine smiles and ask what I've been up to, and they don't skimp on toppings.  What happened to the nutritional guide on Mucho Burrito's website, though? I had to dig to find it, and it's hard to read now. I hope it's up-to-date, because I rely on it to make sure I'm not accidentally ingesting dairy and/or gluten:  http://www.muchoburrito.com/Mucho_Fans/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Screen-Shot-2013-09-10-at-3.43.24-PM.png"}
{"text":"I came here with mediocre expectations and was still let down when I got my food. I got the taco trio; one chicken taco and two pork tacos. All three tacos were bland, overstuffed, and soggy because of the watery salsa. I was so disgusted by the end of my meal that I thew most of the last taco out because I couldn't eat something so bad. It's quite a shame though, the service was really friendly and made us want to return (this was before we bit into the food)."}
{"text":"Service is excellent and the food is great. Best Mexican food experience in the area (yes, Jimmy Guaco sucks)."}
{"text":"Had a really nice experience here. I ordered a chicken Burrito which was prepared in front of me and I was able to pick out what I wanted inside of it. Everything was fresh and the place was clean.  Good value for your $. Had a great experience and would go back again."}
{"text":"I visited today on 5th May 2018 at 12.30pm I had been to mucho burrito at oakville maple grove and its excellent food and service. This location menu was a little different. I wanted my burrito bowl so asked the lady not to give me rice but only salads. They only had green and red pepper veggie. They ended up giving me 30% of the full bowl. What do they think I am? Stupid that I will pay the full price? I asked the lady how come they dont have more than one selection of veggies. This tall black lady got very upset with me and started yelling at me that she offered rice or grains and I said no. She even started to talk to two other customers about me. I got really upset with the bad customer service. Why did she act like an angry mom to me? I surely didnt deserve that bad customer service. You are there to help customers understand your product lady. If you are so upset with your job then dont work there. I simply walked away and will never return again  I told some friends about how bad this location customer service was. One of my friends told me she encountered the same bad service last night and the food was equally bad. I am so thankful I saved my money at least. Total waste of time!"}
{"text":"Mucho buritto is almost always our Calgary fast food of choice. Both of us got a small veggie burrito it was stuffed right full and tasted great."}
{"text":"Recently opened at the old Second Cup location, the Grand Opening is 8 December 2012 with half-price burritos.  Apparently the medium burrito is about 7\" long, 3\" wide, and 1.5\" thick. The beef burrito came with salsa and sour cream and lots of veggies and rice.  They serve Pepsi products and Mexican beers.  The service line moves right to left, opposite of what I am used to. Maybe it's Canadian?  The store is a lot brighter than when Second Cup resided here and more open with the obvious Mexican music playing in the background.  A nice addition to the Mission/Rideau Park area and open to 10:00pm most nights."}
{"text":"...brand new location in a new plaza with the longo's grocery store. the staff was very friendly, the manager it seemed greeted us as it looked like our first time there, which it was. he showed us around the menu which was pretty nice of him.   we ordered: 2 carne asada burritos, one small, one medium, good.   the hot salsa's pretty hot the way i like it, but the guacamole had giant chunks of onions - dislike. i would definitely go back, it sure kicks chipotle's butt!"}
{"text":"Quality fast food Mexican food. If you want good portions in your tacos and burrito's this is a good choice, it'll kick taco's bells brass in quality and taste."}
{"text":"Love the food here :) and the two guys were so nice. Regular burrito with guacamole and they decided to not even charge me the extra dollar. Bless those guys, you're amazing!"}
{"text":"if you are into buritos, this is decent as far as chain stores go.  It was tasty, it was hot, but after travelling around all these years its not original, but when you are hungry at least you know what to expect.  So it was good, but not unique.  I would go back if I'm in the area, but i wouldnt go out of my way for it.  decent food, fair price, not exactly exciting but good enough."}
{"text":"I went a couple of times with my mom and a couple of times with my boo, enough times to make a good choice on whether of not this place is a staple in my go-to eating spots.  It's pretty alright. The seating isn't that vast, but that's understandable seeing as it's a chain and it's not the ONLY one of it's store ya'know? However, I must say that it as clean and the music fit the atmosphere :) The food was alright, the food didn't taste that fresh nor did the store was an epitome for Mexican culture.  It was alright. Not the best but not the worst. The only con's that are mostly in my book are the oiliness, and texture of the food. However their options were great!"}
{"text":"945pm on a weeknight (Country Hills location) and this biz was still open. Hard to find a snack/dinner at times late-night in the Calgary burbs that is semi-healthy on the fly. Walked in, no line up and ordered a regular sized chicken burrito made before my eyes in no time. With zero wait time in ordering. Friendly service too. What beats a burrito for a full meal? You have all the food groups in one hell of a tasty torpedo. All fresh. You can choose healthy too, whole wheat tortilla, brown rice instead of white, ease up on the sauces and just choose salsa. And little to no cheese. I have decided after eating my burrito in this second sitting (they are filling!) that I will be going there even more often than I do now. They made my food taste how I wanted it to be, hot and spicy and filled me up all for $10."}
{"text":"We love Mexican fare and today we had time to whip into this place for the second time ever since we moved to Calgary. I had never heard of this chain before in Ontario. The service is always good here, professional and I never feel sick afterwards like I do at SOME taco places. Won't mention any names, lol. Today I had a tilapia burrito and I like them to make it as spicy as possible. Not bad.  My companion had the better looking meal for today - 3 soft tacos, fully loaded, one with guacamole (extra 99 cents). Nice that he could get 3 different meats for his 3 different tacos. He got chips and salsa with that as well. The chips were really good but the salsa as fresh as it was, was bland, needed a kick. LOVE the fresh cilantro in the salsa and as an option inside the tacos/burritos. We are cilantro people. :) It is a clean place to sit down and enjoy your food and the Latin music playing is fantastic. With the hot sun streaming through the windows and the Spanish music, you could close your eyes and for sure feel like you are someplace south. Not bad for a fast food place! Not cheap here but I would rather pay a little more for fresh ingredients any day. A hit with us, shall return! Sept 2014 2 years later I believe the owners here are the same but the feel is different. Every time we walk in, we are made to wait when ready to order while the staff mill around slowly, stir their guacamole, talking amongst themselves, etc. The owners are stingy with the toppings here compared to other Mucho locations for sure. Even with their napkins they hold behind the counter. My chosen burrito tonight was shrimp and there really was no shrimp taste to it at all. The shrimp had run out and I am not sure for the $12.50 burrito, I got my money's worth. There was no offer to make more or maybe compensate with a bit of fish or any other protein. The owner was out on the floor working on his laptop and not in an office which may have been a more appropriate choice. He asked us how our meal was at the end which was nice to which we responded it was 'OK'. He did not seem too concerned about that and did not follow up with a goodbye or a thank you. The visits here lately have cost the store a star. I will drive further from home to get to another location when in the mood for fast Mexican."}
{"text":"I rarely give a 5 star.. Excepts American Express which many Canadian restaurants do not or do not put on their doors. Pretty much a Qdoba in the States, which is one of my favorite taco/burrito places. I had the steak tacos which were imo better then Qdobas they had a much better spice on the meat. I will be back for sure when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"For Toronto, half decent burritos, but really now, that's not saying much.   Yes, this is better than Taco Bell, but it's not good Tex-Mex.  Also a bit pricey for what you get (about $10 for a burrito), the meat isn't especially good, nor are the beans or guac.  Chips are generally stale and flavorless, and the salsa is mediocre.  If you come from our friends to the south, just pass on this place, you're going to be disappointed with Toronto Mexican food here for the most part.  If you're in the mood for Mexican and don't mind a slight drive, I'd recommend driver over to El Sombrero at Hurontario and 401.  It's a bit pricey as well for Mexican food, but it's actually Mexican food!!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here the other day I got their Mucho sized Burrito and it's huge the thing has to weigh like 2.5LB's I gave it to my girlfriend to hold and she was pretty disgusted with the fact that I could finish it.  Overall I thought it was good I haven't had a better burrito in Durham but that's probably because there is little to no Mexican joints around here. The burrito was a little dry which was my only complaint other than the price (Burrito was almost $12).   Overall I wouldn't frequent too often just because I think it's a little pricey but I don't know of anywhere better for a burrito and if I need a burrito in a pinch I'll probably end up here."}
{"text":"I'm giving four stars simply because I enjoy the food, but the service sucks. Their menu is fresh, you can see them grilling more chicken/veggies as soon as they run a bit low and shrimp is grilled to order if you choose that as your taco or burrito filling. I always stick to the pulled pork and find it a pretty solid version (not dry). Their portions are MASSIVE and I once made the mistake of ordering the largest size burrito (the mucho size I believe) and it is literally the size of a newborn baby (not a preemie either lol). I suggest sticking to the classic size or even the size below that. They have a ton of toppings to choose from, including two types of rice, two types of beans, corn, grilled veggies, three types of salsa, guac, etc. They do charge extra for guac ($1.25?) but it's a generous portion usually and worth it. There are many meats to choose from as well. Now, the crappy part: the service!! There are two guys there that are great, serve you fast, listen to what toppings you want, are professional, etc, but the female workers have a stick up their you-know-what. They don't listen, they rush through (even if there's no one behind you), they don't always put a full portion like the men do, and they give you attitude. I think they must be part of the family who owns this place, because I can't imagine keeping such bad employees otherwise! I will still go back for the food when shopping in the area, but I always feel on alert when ordering and dreading who I'll get in the lineup!"}
{"text":"My hubby is burrito obsessed.  Me not so much.  Had the veg burrito one night.  All ingredients were fresh and made to order.  Friendly staff and nice decor.  Enough said for a fast food place...."}
{"text":"It was a rainy day in Burritoville and we just wanted a place to get out of the nasty weather and have something to eat.  It hit the spot alright.  The food was good, in a chain store kinda way. The service was certainly friendly.  Our burritos were made the way we asked, and i would hope so, we were standing right there ;).  Also taste wise it was what you expected, so nothing to really complain about. The place was clean and trendy, but those metal chairs dont exactly welcome you.  Just sayin' so other than that, for mexican chow on the run, all is good."}
{"text":"Quality food that was fast and cheap. Its basically like a subway but with burritos - you get your pita and walk down the counter adding the toppings you like. There are a variety of options - chicken, shrimp, steak...all the same price. They add rice and beans, have a variety of salsas. Everything you could ask when you're paying less than ten dollars.   I got a small but was still satisfied. They also have a variety of other options, my friend got a salad and it looked delicious. Every burrito is pressed and grilled in front of you.   Now this isn't a fine dining experience. Its not a private shop with a celebrity Spanish chef. But it is a delicious experience, friendly service and a great price. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Very good service.  Delicious coffer with cute near face"}
{"text":"Food: 4/5 Atmosphere: 5/5 Service: 4/5 Overall experience: 4/5  (1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)  YUMMMMM! I absolutely love this place for great, fresh, Mexican food! I stumbled upon this place when i noticed this opened up in Country Hills. I decided to go check it out because I have never heard of it before. It was one of the the best experience I had at a fast food place.   What I especially love is how everything is fresh and fairly healthy (if you choose the right ingredients); it's like a Mexican version of Subway. When my bf and I first came here, we were kind of overwhelmed by the choices and the owner was there to gladly explain how it worked which was super nice of him.  Their menu consists of burritos, quesadillas, tacos, salad bowls, and nachos. My bf got one of their burritos which comes in 10', 12' or XL. I have no clue how anyone could finish a XL because a 12' is HUGE and enough to fill your stomach up. I always have troubles holding it and trying to fit all the fixings into one bite.   You have a choice between flour or whole wheat tortilla; what kind of meat you want (beef, chicken, pork, sirloin steak, chorizo sausage, fish, or vegetables); and a bunch of other fixings like corn, beans, rice, vegetables, cheese, etc.. It's definitely fresh because I saw them saute vegetables in the back. The burrito also comes with fresh salsa (mild, hot, green tomatos, or sweet corn and black beans). I absolutely love their salsas and you can definitely taste the freshness in it. I also find it nice how they supply you with a variety of hot sauces if you still don't find your food flavourful which is not possible; there is an amazing burst of flavour in their food. It is a tad pricey, you're looking at around $7-$9 for a burrito but it's well worth it for the taste and quality!   The quesadillas are equally as good, and I also tried their nachos which is so BADDDDD but so GOOOD! haha or it so GOOD it's BAD. At first, it seems like they rip you off by giving you a handful and a half of chips, but then they top it with a big pile of your choice in meat and slather it in cheese sauce which is then heated in the oven so it's ooey and gooey. You can also add salsa and cream cheese.  Among the great food is friendly staff. The last two times I came here, the owner was in the restaurant and was super friendly to every one of his customers. He said \"hello\", asked if it was your first time here, and helped clean up when you were finished. I like this location because there is a patio, a drive through and you can also sit down inside a beautifully clean and well decorated restaurant. You also get a great glimpse of their kitchen with an actual grill, stove top and oven which fast food restaurants often lack *ahem* McD  Overall, Mucho Burrito is a great place for 'fast' food; nothing like taco bell and taco time. It's a little pricey, but it's well worth the money especially the burritos. I haven't been to the other locations, but this location has the friendliest staff I've ever met, and most of them happen to be Mexican like the young owner."}
{"text":"The pros: Great burritos, this place would be a (better) equivalent of subway but with Mexican food. A few option of tortilla/beans/veggies/sauces. You can buy extra \"queso\" and/or guacamole. The decor is really great and the produces are very fresh. The service is fast and the place is very clean.  The cons: The choices are very limited. You go there for a burrito, like you go to subway for a sub. Also the vegetarian option is not very filling. With only 20-30 cents reduction compared to the meat option, I thought I would get more rice/beans. I just got an extra handfull of mixed vegetables. :(  I would probably go back if if I'm near and need a quick bite."}
{"text":"I've been to Mucho a couple of times, the first time I got the chick burrito bowl and took it home to try and I loved it. The food was amazing, my brother tried it and wanted some as well. So when I went the second time I got some for myself and my brother. We have tried the burrito bowl (chicken), as well as the quesadilla with my mom. The food is always made right, we have never had a problem. Has to be my go to spot when I'm craving some for lunch."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints me. Took my mom for the first time and she loved the food."}
{"text":"I had the BEST taco salad at Mucho Burrito at First Canadian Place this week (and last week), and I'm STILL thinking about it. It was simply AWESOME. I ordered the vegetarian salad which came in a whole wheat tortilla shell bowl (white is available too!). The salad comes with a bed of fresh green lettuce topped with your choice of veggies: stir fried peppers with onions, black beans, pinto beans, corn and black bean salsa, 3 choices of salsa (mild, medium and hot) and guacamole with your choice of a creamy or vinaigrette dressing... and cheese and sour cream if you desire. I topped my salad with everything but the dressings, cheese and sour cream (the salsa was enough for me) and it was an orgasmic experience. I fell instantly in love... TWICE (since this week was my 2nd time back).  You'll fall in love at first bite with this vegetarian salad too!  With its fresh ingredients and fairly priced at $5.99 before tax...a marriage that will last decades is definite!  Oh yea, I tried the famous Chipotle Mexican Grill at Yonge-Dundas Square.... Mucho Burrito totally trumps Chipotle! (I actually tweeted this and Mucho Burrito retweeted my tweet and thanked me for being a fan!) Life is definitely better on Bay Street... even for vegans!  EDIT: One more thing... \"double bonus\" Unlike the ultra popular Chipotle Mexican Grill at Yonge-Dundas, Mucho Burrito's pino beans are NOT laced with bacon. This means vegetarians, vegans, and other health nuts could have TWO types of beans in their salad bowls or in their veg burritos! YAY!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of franchises because they have limited menus and most of the time the quality of the food is very poor and inconsistent. However, I think I found a franchise that I don't despise and that I'm actually a big fan of, that franchise is of course: MUCHO BURRITO.   I was having one of those days where I just wanted to be a loner and didn't really have an appetite. I was heading towards the Eaton's Centre through the underground path, but I decided to  \"window shop\" through the Bay Adelaide Centre food court. I knew they had a Mucho Burrito there, but I'd always dined at the First Canadian Place location. When I walked near the counter, a friendly cashier/ server greeted me and asked me what I would like. Because she was so friendly, I felt bad saying I was just looking, so I ordered what I always get at the FCP's Mucho Burrito: the veggie taco salad.   The Bay Adelaide's salad was just as good as its FCP's counterpart. The whole wheat baked tortilla shell bowl was light, crispy and very satisfying. All of the ingredients (pinto beans, black beans, guacamole, corn salsa, hot salsa, mild salsa, cooked veggies)  were fresh and very tasty. The server who greeted me was knowledgeable about her product (she knew one of her dressings were vegan), and generous with the ingredients and the hot sauce that I told her to add -I eat practically everything spicy.  It was an awesome salad and it totally brightened my day! Yes, a salad can make one happy, especially a Mucho Burrito salad! A salad can also be the ultimate comfort food... so forget about those sugary and fattening desserts.. AND those deep fried temptations, such as fries and chicken... that will only enlarge your hips and dress size! This is the first time that I've ever been completely happy with a franchise restaurant. If they sold shares in the stock market, I'll totally consider investing in them."}
{"text":"I love Mucho Burrito for its freshness and food you can see made in front of you. I like getting a healthy meal on the move. I had not been to this location before but was in the area and needed a light meal for lunch. For $2.99 you can get a hell of a little bowl of chicken tortilla soup, loaded (yummy chicken). It does not look pretty when served as the broth is full of sour cream, guac and cheese but is well seasoned and packs a punch (if you add a little hot sauce, especially!)  Of course I added the killer hot sauce and needed 100 napkins and all the Kleenex my purse held! Haha!  Service at first was... absent really. Then they all came out of the back at once after a couple of minutes (2pm) and we were off to the races.  I sat at a high top by the window and watched the world of Mission go by to Mexican cha-cha tunes .  Great value here.  Oh, and get the chips on the side with the soup - I am convinced that you will get more this way instead of on top of the small soup and they are SO good!"}
{"text":"We traveled as a team of 30 people to Calgary and were fortunate enough to select Mucho Burrito as one of our meal options while there.   It was a very good experience for the entire team.    Now onto the food.  It was GREAT.  The burritos were big and mucho delicioso.  The salsas were delicious too.  The manager Dali was very thoughtful, quick at responding and pre-thinking to make sure our order was perfect and ready to go for pick up.  We really appreciate that.  Mucho Burrito is a place we'll be sure to visit when we return to Calgary next year.  Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"Came again today, and I don't know whether I would come back again.   I'm still not familiar with the way to order and they tend to rush me.  It doesn't help when I can't hear what they are saying, nor do they understand what I am asking them.   They have about 5 people working the assembly line, each in charge of a few things. It moves quickly, but it's so loud that I can't hear the choices of sauce, and she didn't offer me any salsa.    When I changed my mind from a salad, it just threw them off and everything was out of order.   At around $9, it's quite expensive for a burrito. I got it grilled, but it may as well not have. I think they skimp on this due to time.  My lunch was a big mush of rice, beans guac and I barely tasted the meat.   The owner was around, it gets really busy during lunch time and i suggest coming before 12. He seemed to be doing random things, and I didn't know he was the owner, dressed in casual clothes, just some guy who was saying things I didn't understand.   I don't like being rushed, might not come back for a long while."}
{"text":"Tried their beef burrito  with all the condiments and it was very good. This location in Upper Canada mall is in the food court  (obviously) and the staff there are fast and courteous. I'm definitely trying their chicken quesadillas, next."}
{"text":"This review is based on my Mealpal experiences. If you're looking for a great bang for your buck with Mealpal, you should definitely try out Mucho Burrito.  They have solid meals with these qualities:  - freshly made in front of you  - portion sizes stay the same regardless if you're purchasing via Mealpal or at regular price   - the greens don't taste wilted and spoiled  - the meats are well flavoured  - they don't skimp out on the servings of meat  - you will feel very full after eating   Mucho Burrito mainly serves burrito bowls for Mealpal.  I have tried their pollo bowl, carnitas bowl, and carnitas salad bowl. All of them were well-received.  They do taste a little saltier than other Mealpal items, but the overall flavour of the bowls is above average for what you normally get via Mealpal. Since they make the bowls in front of you rather than giving you something that was pre-made an hour ago, you have an opportunity to customize the bowl by asking to substitute certain ingredients.  I love asking for less rice and more greens, though you should definitely try the rice as it forms a nicely seasoned base for the plethora of flavours in the bowl.  Lastly, you're going to love the large portion of meat they mix into the bowl!  For 5 dollars, it's a steal and you could even be more economical by saving half of it for dinner (yes, it's very large in portion size)!"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service - the manager actually went to each table to ask if food was ok, etc. Tasty, good portion, salad with fresh, crunchy tortilla bowl. Delicious quesadilla. Free chips/salsa if you order with their app. I"}
{"text":"So gross! Got a bowl with chicken. Chicken tasted hard like it was frozen and not fully cooked. I got mild salsa that was really spicy. They were super cheap with toppings. I ended up throwing out the entire thing after two bites. Never will I go back there. I want my money back. Will go to Chipolte next time."}
{"text":"This is a great choice for fast food. Every time I have been the food is very fresh. I usually get the mucho burrito with chicken, which is more than big enough to fill me up."}
{"text":"Good food, good ingredients. Tasty burrito but it wasn't that special. Better then most burrito places I have been too"}
{"text":"mucho burrito to burritos is what mcdonalds is to steaks. miss me with that garbage cuhhh"}
{"text":"If you wanted a hamburger, would you go to McDonalds? If not, then don't go to Mucho Burrito for burritos. There are so many better places around. The toppings were not fresh, the staff seemed insulted that you don't have their options and menu memorized, and the food requires a fork and spoon to eat. My burrito basically exploded when I picked it up and the toppings all came out. My friend ordered the quesadillas and literally had to scoop it off the plate with a fork in order to eat it. It was also very greasy and left a bad aftertaste.  Mucho disappointed."}
{"text":"Decent standard fare that pleases the palate, is fairly nutritious, and offers enough choices to keep the lunch crowd coming back. I'd actually give it 3.5! Mucho Burrito is quite good even though it's not my go-to style fastfood fare, unless it's Topanga in Vancouver. The size of their wraps are large, and might be good for two or left over for an evening snack. But it's a better fast-food resto than most of its kind, and easily outstrips the likes of Subway that's now known to have questionably-nutritious mystery meat."}
{"text":"I checked this out based on the good reviews. First impressions were good, walked in and heard the latin beat in the parking lot...they pump the music outside so the experience starts before you even get inside. Once inside I was suprised at the size of the place..even more suprised at the nice booths that they had...usually restaurants like this jam in all the tables they can....here it was relaxed and spacious.  I ordered 2 vegetarian tacos and a side of chips and cheese.   They have a lot to choose from whether you go strictly veggie ( like me) or choose the meat options. My tacos consisted of beans, cheese, peppers, guac, sour cream, lettuce, cilantro, med salsa, and burrito sauce.  Everything was fresh, fresh fresh, and what I like best about Mexican food, the bright snappy flavours. However they were a MESS to eat, which would have been ok if they were wrapped for eating, but they werent they were just sitting on a paper liner in the middle of a large metal tray.  A mess to eat, but still delicious...next time I may ask for them to wrap them or something.  The Nacho chips were ok...not warm or anything...but ok. The queso sauce was FANTASTIC, delicious cheese with bit of tomato in it...truly delicious.   The statf were friendly, food delicious, and atmosphere cool.  I will go back. Oh yah, and plenty of parking too.   :)"}
{"text":"Finally a decent Mexican takeaway place in my neighborhood. As a vegetarian, Mexican Is always a great option, and so I was happy to see mucho in mission.  The decor inside is bright, cheerful and modern, with a booth, some banquette type seating and tables. Its small inside, but nice.  The owner of this location is a guy names Madison. Very cool and friendly and seems to be instilling the franchise values in his team there.  He seems to remember the regulars which is important.  The amazing thing about this place is that they cook all the stuff fresh. Fresh grilled meats, fresh grilled veggies, and they prepare this all right in front of you.  Prices are excellent considering the quality. Its always clean inside with hokey Mexican music, but I like it.  They have a great little outdoor patio that also has music playing, and is great for people watching. I imagine they are going to have a busy summer.  Ole!"}
{"text":"the staff are pretty good there & follow instructions closely. They use whole beans on the burritos which is a huge plus & the fried vegetables are good. they would get 4 stars if they didnt charge for guacamole. the pork is a little iffy but the barbacoa is fantastic & they have good fish tacos. seating is limited if you go during peak hours not a problem for me as i eat at 3 but when i have been there around noon its too full."}
{"text":"The portions are good and the pricing is average. Its better than quesada but not as much selection as burrito boyz. Over-all ok."}
{"text":"Went there today, they have changed the menu, so instead of having your choice of toppings on the nachos I used to go for, they only put what the menu says they have. Plus, the serving is smaller. Last time I was there, they had a choice of hot sauces out to top your order, not anymore, now you have to buy a bottle, they are $7.95 each. In the same area, there used to be napkins, now there are none, I had to ask for some from behind the counter.  My girlfriend ordered the taco's, they were cold (I know we should have asked them to heat them up, but it was enough work just getting the nachos the old way).  In my last review, I mentioned that next to try was the soup. Like the nachos, there is no longer a choice of toppings, you get just what the menu states.  This does not entice me to try the soup at all, I really liked the idea of choosing what I wanted in my soup.  Anyways, was a good place to stop while we were out shopping, but the new menu is far from good, so we wont be back."}
{"text":"Ordered the Small Pollo Burrito from an unenthused staff member who half-heartedly tried to up-sell me the large by saying \"the small is *really* small\"... Declined, but had her add Mexican Brown Rice, Black Beans, Mild Salsa and Guacamole (extra $1.50) for a grand total of $10.00.  I'd have been able to stomach the cost had if not been for the lacklustre burrito itself; bland, bland, bland. With so many other decent fast food options in the Eaton Centre Food Court I can safely say that I will not be recommending or returning to Mucho Burrito."}
{"text":"Went with some kids for a quick bite. We all had burritos only. Staff is friendly and patient considering there were 4 kids and 1 adult trying to decide what they want! Good quality food. Will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Mucho Burrito is always delicious, but this visit was especially memorable. The fellow helping us was named Sunny and he bent over backwards to give us great service with a great sense of humor. I don't think I've experienced such good service at a restaurant like this before. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Good mexicain fast food. , tacos ,bowls, salads, quesadillas. Fresh and fast. Gets busy at lunch but things move fast. Large dining room. Self service at counter. They have four types of meats. Many toppings all fresh. Friendly staff. Clean and bright. I'm a regular here. Im no mexicain food expert but this is fresh filling fast and reasonably priced. The map is wrong. Its close to the McDonalds"}
{"text":"The Greater Toronto area is a Mexican Food Dessert.   I'm not saying there are no Mexican restaurants in Toronto, just that compared to what I've experienced living in Detroit, Seattle, and Los Angeles they are comparatively few, and far between. Also, in comparison the menus are usually pretty limited.   Mucho Burrito is a decent Mexican restaurant, I would say that it is comparable to Salsarita's Fresh Cantina  in Detroit, or QDoba in general. They serve burrito's (big surprise with the name), tacos, Quesidilla and taco salad. If you are looking for enchiladas, or tamales etc they aren't here. This is place actually almost set up exactly the same as Salsa. The food is made in a assembly line type setup, similar to Subway. You get to chose which meat you want, they steam it, you chose your salsa and vegetables and get the option of guacamole (which costs a dollar extra and they give you like a tea-spoon for a dollar), they also have a sauce they call burrito sauce.   The price was ok, and the food was decent. I would say that it's somewhat of a step up from Taco Bell, but not really quite a proper Mexican restaurant. However, for what it is, I thought it was really quite decent, and it's nice to have something mexican that I don't need to drive downtown for.   In total I was very satisfied with what i got."}
{"text":"The owner came to me, welcoming me, identifying himself as the owner and requesting how was my food, how pleased I was and if I had comments or concerns  I said \"Yes, it's always good here, clean and with tasty food\" I only said the true ;)  Not my first time here, and it won't be the last one neither!!! I love this little fast food place"}
{"text":"The first mucho burrito I ever went too and still going twice a month. Found the rice and other stuff always to be fresh. So far friendly staff just a tad bit in a hurry to serve you. Started my ghost pepper burrito's here and they were ahmazing.  Always clean when I came. Bathrooms were tidy most of the time and its convenient to grab a burrito hide it and take it to the movies (yeah I am admitting to that).... :0  Love their sauces and carnitas."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Mucho Burrito ever since my first experience. Everything I've tired has tasted great.  My only caution to the reader is be aware of the portion size... it gets big, fast. LOL. I small order usually fills me up just fine.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"2.5 my coworkers and i came here for lunch.  it was okay nothing to rant and rave about.  i would come back hoping to be impressed the next time.  And i don't usually say that.  I have FAITH that they could get better.  LOL.  Portion was kind of lower than average, stingy.  I ordered veggie bowl.  With that your supposed to get beans, rice, shrimp (or whatever your \"meat\" is, cheese, and obviously the various types of salsas, and sour cream, some corn type thing and guac is extra.  I skipped out on the beans, and the cheese, and the sour cream.  The server didn't start with big portions to begin with and by the time i finished excluding so many options they had due to dietary restorations that she did not expect, its not like she made up for it by saying \"did you want more rice instead of beans or a bit more veggies since your getting less options\".  I had to say, Uhh can you put more of something.  It's little things like that, that make you feel like your getting Jipped off and feel like people are not being customer focused or conscious. The food itself was OKAY.  Not great, not terrible.  It kind of made me feel the sensation of \"whatever\".  whatever that means LOL.  Now when I say I would go back, I would but I would probably try all the surrounding restaurants even if its a different restaurant type, before I go back, I mean...if I was stranded.  LOL"}
{"text":"I have had the misfortune of going to this restaurant twice now, as my son is not yet a discriminating connoisseur of good mexican (or tex mex) food, but after today I told him I won't be taking him any more. This location seems to be the worst we have been to. Let's not pretend to be anything more than a glorified Taco Bell or other low end chain. The food sat under heat lamps in industrial bins, at temperatures I would bet are questionable according to what I sampled. It does not take long to cook small portions of meat at high temperatures in order to serve fresh product, but I guess that is not what they are going for. I specifically asked for a soft corn tortilla, which the non-latin gentleman told me they had (although I think he was confused about the difference between corn and flour, because I got a soggy flour tortilla). Add to that the tepid, bland filling and it left a lot to be desired. The restaurant's ventillation system was also not working well today because it was smoky (I am not sure from what) and I started to have trouble breathing in that enclosed space, so when the coughing got too bad we decided to take the rest of the food and go.  My son liked his burrito, and there are a few different salsas to pick from, so I contemplated giving this restaurant a 2 star rating, but then I started to resent the pretense that this chain is somehow better than the others so I stuck to my guns. Yes, there are a few more options on the menu, but lukewarm, stingily served, vintage meat selections and soggy, textureless tortillas cannot be juxtaposed with fresh accoutrements and still achieve a high standard.  I would suggest that someone wanting mexican, not some compromised version of mexican intended for us non-latinos, go and support one of the local restaurants run by true mexicans...for fast food lovers two of the local farmers markets have very good mexican offerings. Is no one else sick of \"big box\" and franchises??"}
{"text":"This Mucho Burrito lives within a corner section of the Rio-Can Colossus Centre next to Clothing and Accessory Stores but across is Colossus Theatre, Hero Burger, and Second Cup while a few franchise restaurants are just a few further steps down the OUTLET center.   Weekend Lunch was quiet and I guess I'm not sensitized to the whole Downtown FAST FOOD trend yet as when I look at Fast Food, I imagine a meal COMBO under $7.50 and you serve your own utensils and no tip is required. This meal was nearing $13(Doubled) as I ordered the Barbacoa Quesadilla 12\" ($8.99) and a Lemon/Lime Jarritos ($2.49).   The Quesadilla was made to order with Slow Cooked Beef and Grilled Vegetable as my option rather than Rice. Cheese mixture was added on top of the meat selection and Whole Wheat Tortilla. It was grilled on a Panini Grill with a timer on it which if I remember correctly is 1 min 40 seconds.   It was served with a side of Salsa where I picked Pico de Gallo(Fresh Tomato Salsa) which was basically chopped Tomato not necessarily fresh and couple SPECKS of Red Onion with no Cilantro inside or seasoning. The Sour Cream had a POOL of water underneath so I had to question my bravery and riskiness which I usually am highly volatile.   The Quesadilla itself was not too bad as I liked how the grill made the flavours MELT together with the Cheese and Grilled Peppers but the Slow Cooked Beef could need more flavour added. I tasted that the Beef wanted to be noticed but it was still too SHY.   TIP: Lime/Lemon Jarritos might have \"NEW\" flavour stated on it and it is \"Naturally Flavoured\" but MANGO is still the way to go."}
{"text":"Similar to subway. Choose your meal : tacos, quesadillas, burritos or salad and dress it how you like. With meat or without. If you like spicy you won't be disappointed! Usually when you order spicy at a restaurant it's never spicy. Here I took the Mexican rice, black beans, jalapeño and extra spicy salsa in my burrito. Holy shit was it spicy!  You can even add fresh cilantro. I'll definitely be coming back if I'm in need of a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Food was tasty. unfortunately took longer then expected when we were the only ones being served. 2 of us, 8 employees, 15 minutes"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a pollo burrito with lettuce, pico de gallo, sour cream, and guacamole this afternoon. It was pretty tasty with fresh ingredients inside.  I'm on bed rest at the mo so I didn't physically go to Mucho Burrito, but my father did. He said that this location was clean with a great staff. Pricing was also very reasonable for my frugal father. This location is in the new Leaside Village plaza; parking is plenty and there are also a lot of other businesses, including banks, coffee shops, a nail salon, and a grocery store.  I'll definitely be going in for a taco or burrito once I'm better.  Good for: quick bite"}
{"text":"First good Taco I have ever had in Canada. Became a Taco lover my last time in Cancun and quite frankly most places that serve Tacos in Toronto suck.   My only complaint here is that if you do not decide to eat in the resto your tacos may become soggy and fall apart even if you live less than five minutes away (depends on what you load your taco with I guess).   I have only ever tried the chicken tacos which is what I fell in love with in Mexico late night after the clubs but my cousin swears by the beef as well"}
{"text":"I went there last night and got 2 big burritos, one chicken, ?and one beef. They are delicious and I'm? still working on them. Taste? great for breakfast."}
{"text":"Ok.  Far from the best, but service was quick and friendly! Selection and flavor are average."}
{"text":"We heard this was the Chipotle equivalent up in Canada.    Sadly, it was quite disappointing.  The concept is the same, but something was lost in the execution.    Rice was pretty bland, and the carnitas I ordered was overly saucy, causing the burrito to get soggy.  They were also quite stingy with the salsa and veggies.  Chipotle burritos are practically bursting, whereas these ones probably only 75-80% as full.    Still gets 3-stars as it is better then nothing.  Will probably pick up another one... Perhaps."}
{"text":"Love Mucho! I love that they have lots of salads to choose from and that their salad bowls are edible. As someone who doesn't eat meat, I also like that they have sautéed veggies and it's not just your basic lettuce and tomato salad.   Other than the food, service was fast and so was the speed from which I got my food to the point I cashed out."}
{"text":"Stopped by here quick for a salad bowl. Big and spacious location, service was quick and restaurant was clean. The day before I was able to get more toppings but today when I asked for more I was told I couldn't."}
{"text":"The worst Guacomole I've ever had. I paid $3 to get onions with little bit of green paste (avocado) and few tomatoes. It was horrible! I can't believe you charge $3 for onions! Will NEVER buy guac from you guys."}
{"text":"Ive been eating here for years and Honestly since the ownership change it has gone down hill I won't be back anymore... They really need to invest on the hot sauce like all the other franchise have... Just saying..."}
{"text":"I felt slightly ripped off after paying for my meal. I ordered a veggie quesadilla with chips and guacamole as a combo. It came up to $13 and it was half a quesadilla. The quesadillas weren't very filling. There were barely anything in them. The guy making them was very cheap with the ingredients. Barely any beans, cheese or veggies. The salsa and guacamole was good and the fountain drink was small. I would not eat here again nor recommend it. It was my first and last experience. I wish I read the reviews here, they are accurate. However, I didn't get sick."}
{"text":"We love this place!!  Healthy as its usually grilled chicken, often made right in front of you.  You can also have steak or shrimps (prawns) inside your Burrito!  Then you choose what you'd like in your own special Buritto!  There are two types of beans, I always choose the more authentic- dark beans- then choose the healthier options. Its soooo good!! I have taken over 10 people here and they all became regulars!  We eat here at least once a week.  Its fast yet not fast food, not in my opinion anyway.  Someone told me... they have organic veggies, I'm not sure about that though.  But a woman that I know, training for a triathlon, does eat here often, I'm a witness!! Enjoy! Oh staff...are amazing!!  The manager, young guy is soooo nice."}
{"text":"The first time I ate Mexican food in Canada and I absolutely loved it!  Great flavor and nice price! Totally recommended!"}
{"text":"The food is ok. Got rid of tilapia burritos which was unfortunate. Money can be spent elsewhere on better food"}
{"text":"I felt their food was okay, nothing to rave about. No lettuce option and basically just ate a lot of diced tomatos in my burrito bowl. BFs tacos were empty and falling apart. Was worth a try but not a fan."}
{"text":"Today I went for the Mucho XL burrito. Rice, peppers, chicken, hot salsa, guacamole, cilantro, and sour cream. This was a big meal so I ordered the Mandarin Jarritos soda to wash it down.  The hot salsa had an initial bite which was gone after the first mouthful. The guacamole was excellent. This is a nice lunch spot so get there early before it gets crowded."}
{"text":"Have tried this location several times hoping it would improve, but sadly, after my last attempt this week, I will never return here with the present owner/manager.  .  As with previous visits, he was both rude, and non-accommodating to our order requests. This time, to top it all off, he was serving the customers ahead of us holding a small CHILD in his arms at the same time he was dishing food!  Disgusting!  we immediately left the premises, never to return under present ownership/management."}
{"text":"I'm quite surprised by the negative reviews! This isn't my favourite restaurant, but a nice place to come for a quick meal - to stay or to go. I think the portion sizes are pretty generous and this location is not busy in the evenings. My only comment is that I find it is overpriced for what is pretty basic food."}
{"text":"This is my seond experience at Mucho Burrito and it's most likely my last. The service is always good and the dish was prepared quickly but the taste was bland. As if the food was prepared a few days before and has been sitting in the fridge since than.  For a $9.00 burrito I would expect much much more.  I gave this food chain a second chance and even tried a separate location but the consistency was the same.  NO ES BUENO!"}
{"text":"I'm always looking out for a good burrito. I've had their talapia as well as the veg burrito. I have to say, although they are filling, I didn't feel like the value was there for the money. If not for the sauces, the flavor of the food isn't all that special, at least not for the price you pay. The service was fine and the place is clean although not very cozy."}
{"text":"Mucho Burrito was my first awesome burrito experience, (not this location, the one at markham and sheppard) so it will always have a soft spot in my heart!  I came here a few days ago with my sister, and I noticed they changed the menu up a little bit. There's no more soup option :(  I ended up having the ghost pepper burrito.  THAT SHIT WAS AWESOME.  It was a red tortilla, covered in a sweet fig jam, then doused in ghost pepper sauce, with ghost pepper bacon added in as well! I chose the chicken, with all the fixin's and an extra dose of jalaps!  It wasn't as spicy as I hoped..at the time. I saved half, and ate it later. Then my mouth was on FIYAH.  I would defo get it again (but quick! its only available until the end of the month!) but sans the fig jam next time. I liked it at first, but then it just added waaaaaaay too much sweetness.   ALSO DONT FORGET THE JARRITOS. Mango is my fave :)"}
{"text":"I'm normally a fan of Mucho but this location could be better.  This store always seems to be out of half the meats. When they do have lots of peppers/onions available, I get the sense that the person who chopped them up didn't feel like making more than one or two cuts, resulting in a burrito containing a huge chunk of mostly raw green pepper.  The staff always seem put out by my presence as if I should be grateful they're even open."}
{"text":"Decent Mexican. They have a great collection of hot sauces to add to your food.  They had not heard of gluten. I was able to put together a basic gluten-free meal from hard-shelled tacos though.  The side tortilla chips are great!"}
{"text":"The food is fresh but it's nothing to brag about. I've been here a couple of times but cannot say I'm extremely impressed by my experience here. I'm going to start off with this - everything is VERY overpriced.   Just in comparison to some of my favourite spots like fat bastard burrito, it's almost $10-15 more to eat at mucho for the same thing. The food here is usually fresh and they have fresh toppings as well. Very basic meat choices here and we got a steak and shrimp bowl each with an iced tea and it totalled to around $38 in total. (We got the exact same order at fat bastard for $26) The shrimp was marinated and big though. Not bad. The bowl is very filling and perfect for fitting your macros whether you're bulking or cutting. Very versatile on that, so yay! It just sucks because you're limited on the amount of toppings you can put on top.. I think you can only choose up to 4?? Rough.   This place is very homey and has a great seating area. I just don't think it's worth it to pay premium prices on a basic burrito or burrito bowl."}
{"text":"My favorite is their taco salad. I don't get the shell, and I always ask for extra beans because it's so tasty when combined with the burrito sauce. The veggie salad is a good price. It's a nice change from the normal salads that you can get at Freshii or Fast Fresh Foods."}
{"text":"The owner of this location is super stingy with toppings.... The guacamole looks and tastes old... Owner argued with me over everything I wanted to order... Taking my business back to Burrito Boys on Queensway."}
{"text":"Not much other than a quick meal fix, however, the new Ghost Pepper Burrito is worth a try for those of us who like the hot stuff. It is a 12\" burrito, i got the veggie of course( way too many sweet peppers) with two big honking squirts of the Hot Ghost Pepper Sauce. Saved it for dinner cause i wanted it to soak in really good.  Aside from the waay to many sweet peppers, the sauce soaked in perfectly.......worth it just to go back for the hot sauce. wonder if they sell it by the bottle?"}
{"text":"This Mucho Burrito is so CHEAP with toppings and fillings!! I ordered a salad and there was literally no toppings. I had 6 small pieces of chicken, a tablespoon of shredded cheese and salsa and a few pieces of peppers.... after I ate it I was still hungry afterwards! This isn't the first time this happened at this location either. My friend got a quesadilla and had the same complaint. I will not be going back and will not recommend it to anyone.  I'd rather drive to another location further from my house than pay 13$ for a measly salad."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!  I am so impressed with the quantity and quality of food here. I must admit, I didn't have high hopes for this place. I thought it would be a \"greasy\" but quick dinner. I was WRONG.  I ordered a veggie burrito filled with black beans, brown rice, all the veggies, and lots of cilantro. I was excited that there were rice and bean options. The healthy part of me lit up when I saw that everything was being made fresh. My boyfriend ordered the chicken burrito with all the fixings. We also bought 2 drinks, and our total came to about $22. Not bad.  We sat down, and were ready to indulge. I picked up my burrito, and could not believe how heavy it was. I was kidding, saying that I could use it to bicep curl, and burn off some calories before I ate it. We are huge fans of getting lots of food for our money (who isn't?). So a large portion was a definite plus, right off the bat.  Then I ate it. Holy Moses and sweet baby Jesus. It was delicious. I swear, there was a little Mariachi band playing in the background as pinatas were bursting and fireworks were going off! Mind. Blown. My boyfriend felt the same way.  I was actually sad when the burrito was finished *tear*.  The only minuscule downside of this restaurant is that the food takes longer to make than you would expect a \"fast food\" place to take (although, I'd argue that it shouldn't be classified as fast food). However, knowing that the wait was due to everything being cooked fresh made it easier to sit through. And let me tell you, it was worth it!  I'll definitely be coming back here over, and over, and over again!!"}
{"text":"Not worth my money, the atmosphere is good but the food  is just okay. Personally I'd recommend burrito boys over mucho burrito any day"}
{"text":"Although it's a franchise, I find this particular location to be one of the best. Their mixtures taste fresh, service is fast and their staff is very nice.   Prices are high but where aren't prices high? People giving a 1-star just because of \"high\" prices need a reality check. Majority of similar joints are priced the same."}
{"text":"Hit and miss. One day their condiments and toppings taste fresh, but another day they are not. Also, service tends to be slow at this location. The portion size seems small at times and you got to remind them that you're paying $12 for a regular veggie burrito. Either the person will be sensible or they will tell you \"there's an extra charge\" lol. Employees work with no sense of urgency and for what you pay, they really need to step it up."}
{"text":"We had the Taco trio. The meats (chicken, pork and beef) were all cold (i.e. below room temp).  The server said this was normal. I hope the food inspectors re-evaluate this place. The salsa was 'off' and had that 'fizzy' taste. The portions per taco were miniscule. Beans and rice were extra. Really?!?!    Honestly, $26 for two taco trios and one order of chips felt like a complete rip off. We've eaten at other Mucho Burrito locations and they were at least passable. This location in the Eaton Centre Eatery is the worst fast food I've ever eaten. Prepackaged Macdonalds is better than this. What's that tell you?"}
{"text":"Mucho Burrito is a fairly new chain to the GTA.  I had the pork soft tacos. The meat was dry, tough to chew, but most of all it was cold. Unlike the competitive chains the extras are minimal. No choice of rice, beans, veggies, etc.  Portions are far from generous leaving you with the feeling of paying too much for too little.  On the plus side the hot salsa, at least, had a bit of a bite to it. Service was friendly, establishment clean. ----------------------------- 06/2013  I'm revising my review of Mucho Burrito.  They've upped their game and now the portions are reasonable for the price.  Still find the pork to be on the dry/tough side but at least the overall package (taco & burrito) is ok.  On par with the other 'chain' establishment (ie. Chipotle)."}
{"text":"I like coming here sometimes for a semi-healthy meal when i feel lazy. I get the chicken \"burrito\" in a bowl (no tortilla). I don't like   cilantro and i told them that but it's in all the salsas :( and the servers gave it to me :( blah lol. They have beer too but clearly the servers aren't trained  (smartserve) because they give me closed cans the few times i go there. Once I even just took my margarita can home to drink instead haha. Overall the food was good and service was okay. Nothing really special so i might go back in a few months."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints.  This time, I tried the pulled beef burrito.  More flavourful than the pulled pork! The server was very nice and offered a sample of both pork and beef to see which one I liked better.  I put brown rice, grilled veggies (purple onion, red pepper and green pepper), brown beans, shredded mozzarella cheese, burrito sauce, sour cream and guacamole ). Just wish the guacamole wasn't extra since they are in season and most places don't charge extra anymore since it's a staple item. Fantastic, will have again."}
{"text":"I love this place!! The staff are super friendly, service is fast, portions are big and the food is amazing!!! It's a regular stop for my hubby and I on the weekends and will continue to be! Viva Mucho Burrito Shawnessy!"}
{"text":"pleasantly surprised, sis had been moaning about wanting to go here before leaving canada. i was trying to avoid it i hate chipotle, so i expected to hate my lunch here.  but i wasnt, we went at about 1130, i think we had to be the first people of the day, didnt seem busy.  there was no music, and only 3 people working in the entire store.  my food was good, i had specifically asked them to go light with the fillings cause i didnt want a pile of food inside, and it came out perfect. and i think thats what i liked about this place and not about chipotle since they just pile it on no matter what you say.    sis had fish taco said it was good. and while we ate about 10 other people came in so it must be good."}
{"text":"Went for lunch during busy lunchtime crowd. You line up, and the servers, assembly line style, pile on the fillings to order. I ordered the regular chicken burrito, with cubist chicken pieces, followed by some guac, black beans and rice.  They didn't let it warm up enough on the grill, and for $12.95 with a can of soda a bit steep."}
{"text":"First time here and maybe I should've gone to Queen location .... Isn't the meat in the burrito supposed to be at least warm? what happened it's cold? The guy who did my burrito was wrapping it too quick, not even done the toppings.... however the cashier was nice."}
{"text":"I was skeptical to buy food from mucho burrito because I've been disappointed with most (if not all), Mexican restaurants in Toronto. I have to say, there stuff is good. I ordered a barbacoa quesadilla and a tortilla soup and it was really good. The only thing I didn't care for was the salsa on the side. Finally- I find a place that has decent Mexican food!"}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to this location opening. What a disappointment. They put the minimum amount of ingredients they could into my order. Were rude while making it up and it was a to go order. It was all stuck together by the time I got home (5 minute drive)"}
{"text":"Im really suprised reading all them bad reveiws.  This is one of my favourite places to eat.  I go here about 3 times a week.  The prices are very good for the quantity of food.  Not only is the quantity of food great but the quality really good.  The meat is definatly not processed and they do not put small portions of meat on the burritos and if your not satisfied with the amount of meat they put on then just ask for a bit more.  The staff are also very freindly. I see no reason not to give this place 5 stars I would highly recomend eating here."}
{"text":"This was my first time going to any type of burrito place. Knowing that I had never tried a burrito before, I've had many people suggest various places for my 'first time' but we had coupons for Mucho Burrito and it's near where I was going to be so this was it!  Our coupon was for '2 can dine for $14.99' which included two 12\" burritos, two chips with salsa and two pops. Not a bad deal for what I expected to get... a GREAT deal for what I actually received!  Being our first time, we weren't really sure how it all worked but the lovely girl that was assisting us explained the process. \"Ah, so it's like getting a sub, you just ask for the toppings you want.\" Simple enough!  I ordered a chicken burrito and selected grilled vegetables, rice, medium salsa, their bean & corn mixture, burrito sauce (which is basically a chipotle mayo) and sour cream. I believe my husband's was pretty much the same minus an item or two and he had the pulled pork instead. I have to admit, I was shocked at the weight of the thing... it was like a brick!  Everything about our meal was delicious... although I think I preferred the pulled pork over the chicken. The chips and salsa were great as well and a nice addition to the meal. But most importantly, the service was fantastic and that's why I don't hesitate on giving this location a 4-star rating. Fast food at it's finest!"}
{"text":"On June 12th, this location (I'm not sure about the rest of them) had a customer appreciation day and were offering 10\" and 12\" burritos for only $5.00! The lines ups were out the door when we got there, as I'm sure they were all day.  To be honest, based on the sheer volume of people that were in line, I did not expect a stellar performance or burrito but they proved me wrong. They had arranged a very efficient assembly line and were able to hustled customers through without missing a beat in customer service or quality. It was really quite impressive to watch.  I had a chicken burrito and the grill on the chicken was fantastic and added so much flavour.  I'd even go as far as to say that it was probably one of the better burritos I've had at Mucho.  The burrito was great and the customer service was outstanding!"}
{"text":"This place is close to work so I have been by a few times.  Great, friendly service and pretty good burritos.  The one thing they do different here than others is that stir fry some veggies to add to your burrito where most places have the traditional toppings."}
{"text":"Do you want a burrito the size of a small child? Do you enjoy hanging out with friends and stuffing your face? Mucho burrito is the place is for you!   But honestly, the food here is what you would expect. It's not always fresh and the staff is as friendly as any subway employee but I really don't mind it. If I'm not dying of starvation I prefer to spend my money on a better place though.   What I'm trying to say is that I'm going to mucho burrito to get the big boy sizes, or else the quality isn't good enough for just casually dropping in."}
{"text":"The food is fresh and the staff are pleasant.  I recommend the owners take a look at Moe's from the US.  Two things to improve:  get a fountain machine and nix the cans of soda. The burrito was too wet and messy.  They tasted good however."}
{"text":"Depending on who works here you get different burritos. Sometimes they wrap it properly and sometimes they dont which causes you burrito to get messy and fall apart lol  Today I ordered a steak burrito and the girl who seemed to be new wrapped the burrito but forgot to put the meat in it. She then unwrapped it and put the meat back in which resulted in a not properly wrapped burrito  Funny part is her colleague keps saying oh its okay! I've done it too... instead of apologizing"}
{"text":"Mucho Burrito is one of those restaurants I love going to, but have a hard time convincing anybody to come with me. Not because the burritos aren't good or even the side effects of eating a meal made up of mostly refried beans. It's because eating a \"Mucho Burrito\" is quite a task to take on.   Sure, the burritos come in smaller sizes than the namesake \"Mucho\", but not getting the \"Mucho\", the largest size available, is like going to Burger King for a salad. It's just doesn't make sense.  So on the odd occasion I convince someone to join me for an over-sized burrito, I make the most of it and get the largest steak burrito available; smothered in salsa and loaded with grilled vegetables and refried beans. I've never been disappointed.  The staff is usually kind enough to walk you through the menu to make sure you know what you're ordering. The service is speedy enough while still getting your order right most times. The Indian music is an odd touch to a Mexican restaurant, but that's normal in the area.  My only gripe is the prices. You usually end up spending around $15 per person for the burrito alone. It's worth it when I do choose to indulge, but it's probably what keeps me away more than anything (and also why I docked a star)."}
{"text":"Hey you know what? If you want a healthy lunch option that's still somewhat filling, you can do worse than Mucho Burrito.  Is that a glowing review? No.  But I like this place for what it is. Service is super fast. Burritos are mostly fresh and tasty. The small size is low in calories and fat if you don't go for the obvious bad choices (chorizo as a protein, tons of cheese, etc).  Staff are friendly and willing to customize greatly.  I mean, it's not going to blow your mind but I think they do a decent job here. The only thing that I would suggest is to make sure you ask them to drain all their proteins and toppings properly, or your burrito can come up super wet and messy.  But at the end of the day I can swing by, grab my barbacoa burrito with extra veggies and some guac, be in and out in 4 minutes and feel like I had a filling, healthy meal. That's nothing to scoff at.  With Bar Burrito coming in across the street, it'll be interesting to see who offers the better burrito."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Fast, fresh and friendly! Been 2x now, and each time met with friendly service and great tasting burritos!"}
{"text":"My pollo (chicken) bowl was really yummy and filling. I would definitely come to this location again for more in the future. The service was fast and efficient, there were plenty of tables to seat and it was clean. The food was delicious !!"}
{"text":"Wow! They do love to salt their food here, even their salsa and guacamole are salty. Ordered one taco of each: carnitas (pork), barbacoa (marinated beef) and carne asada (grilled beef) all were in flour tortillas. The carnitas were the best tasting out of the three. All the tacos came with salsa, cheese, sour cream and cilantro. Each of them were just dripping with what I think was oil since it was orange, that's probably why they serve them in disposable plates with raised edges.    I always like to have something sweet after I eat so I thought I'd try the Churros; the cashier warned me it would take 5 minutes since they would be making it fresh. It was crispy/chewy on the outside and soft on the inside but they skimped on the cinnamon and sugar (see pic). Serving it with dulce de leche (caramel) dipping sauce didn't help the taste. Definitely not worth $2 for one piece.  If you like your food heavily salted then you'll like it here. Restaurant is clean with friendly staff, lots of seating and lively Mexican music in the background."}
{"text":"It's a fast food type place and I am a little surprised by some of the reviews. I had the Mucho burrito and the kids each had a quesadilla. Everything was as expected. The staff here was great and the food was flavorful. Three adult lunches and two kids meals, all with drinks for under $60. Not bad in my books!!  I can recommend this as a quick great lunch kind of place."}
{"text":"2 1/2 stars.   Blah.  Boring.  Bland.   I was on the run from one meeting to the next and Mucho Burrito was in the building of where I was exiting.  I was hungry.  It was sustenance and not much past that.  Would I go back to Mucho Burrito?  No."}
{"text":"Tasteless overpriced fast food. Not on my last of places to go again  Onion peel in the salsa, no seasoning on the food"}
{"text":"Finally, a gluten-free friendly fast food but healthy restaurant in Ajax!   Their salad bowls are filling,  they put a good sized portion of meat and don't look at you funny when you don't want rice,  beans or peppers.   The guacamole is fantastic.  But then again so are the salsas and all ingredients since they are prepared fresh in house.   This is the best Canadian alternative to Chipotle's in the USA. I just wish they would take a more sustainable and healthy approach to sourcing the meats (non-GMO).  To top it all off,  the men's washroom has a private stall for the urinal. The paper towel dispenser is hands free and there is a garbage can in close proximity to the door. This all might sound trivial,  but not to me.   The staff are all very friendly and knowledgeable about the food. The seating area is kept clean and overall well laid out.   I could eat here daily if only I worked in the area."}
{"text":"It is not bad..it is not good.  It just is.  I usually get the kids burrito - this is enough for me.  The portions for the regular sizes are HUGE!  The kids one even comes with a drink for around $7...plus you get some nacho chips.  I love the fact that they have so many different toppings - you can really get some nice flavours going.  The service is friendly...but a little slow.   I wouldn't come here all the time...but once in a blue moon perhaps - gotta save up my pennies as it isn't cheap (for the regular size meals...the kid's one is fine for me)"}
{"text":"Mucho Burrito is seriously just like Chipotle. There are minuscule differences, but as far as decor, packaging, and menu it is the same. The guacamole however was not tasty; I think it was probably prepackaged or something.   One thing I did like is that they offered a whole wheat tortilla wrap for my burrito. I didn't like that I told the girl making my burrito 3 times that I did not want cheese and she still managed to ignore me and put cheese on the burrito.  As far as the taste, the burrito was extremely bland, even with the salsa. I did like that they offered cans of ginger ale..mmm. Something Chipotle doesn't do."}
{"text":"STINGY!!!!   The owner takes over the food counter just to make sure the portion sizes are SMALL!  Like another review said... it's not like this at other locations.  Go somewhere else and get your money's worth."}
{"text":"This place is a-ok. Nothing mucho to write about.  LOL  Overall a decent lunch place to get your hunger fix well...fixed.  The burritos are huge (for me anyways..it's 2 meals!).  This chain is the Mexican version of Subway.  You stand in line and choose your fixings.  I generally take the Barbacoa (shredded beef).  Decent flavour but could be a bit bolder.  You can choose your spice levels with the different toppings.  The ingredients look pretty fresh, not like they were sitting around all day and then used the next day.  It's as healthy as what you choose to put in your meal so go mucho or go home as they say.  Ok, I think I've exhausted the mucho jokes now.      The burritos are pretty huge - I can get 2 meals out of them so price wise I am ok if it is  little steep with a drink because it's 2 meals for me.  So open wide...you're going to have to if you want to eat here :)  Service is friendly but it can be a little slow if the person ahead of you is taking their time.  In fact if there is a few people ahead of you then most likely you won't have enough time to order and eat in if on your lunch break from work.  And eating a burrito at your desk is...well messy!   The restaurant is small but clean.  Just check to see how long the line is if you are dining in and have limited time.  A few times I have gone to other places when I saw the line up.  45 min for lunch doesn't give you much luxuries like standing in a line :)"}
{"text":"Got 2 burritos a soda and a chocolate milk was $30! Little pricey but it was tasty ! I got the pulled beef and my wife the steak lots of toppings that were fresh and tasty . The food is good I did enjoy it . Place was clean and service was quick . I'd come back again ."}
{"text":"I'm with Chris P, not impressed with this location, had a better experience at other Mucho Burritos.  They are not that friendly, and about an inch away from being a cash-only establishment, b/c they can't take other forms of payment.  The food is good, I like that they use whole beans, instead of refried beans, but they are stingy with the toppings like salsa and guacamole, as noted by other reviewers, and the burritos come out  very lightly toasted.  I think this will be my last visit to this place.  I stand by 1 or 5 stars.  Eating here is better than being hungry,"}
{"text":"No doubt that Mucho Burrito isn't tex mex (for sure, @Jonathan C), it's probably ok mexican, but I'd give it 4 stars for a fast food burrito.  The experience I had at this location was about a kazillion times better than the mucho burrito on Dixie.  With them being about equi-distant for me from work, I'll likely choose this location.  I think the burritos are quite tasty, and they don't scrimp on the salsa that comes with your side of chips like the other above mentioned location.  I really like that you can identify the ingredients, instead of it all looking like mush..."}
{"text":"What's happened? This use to be our favourite fast food in Calgary but last two times we've been here have been a disaster. Everything was made wrong and staff didn't seem to understand English. The staff were asking what was wanted on burrito but not following the instructions. The entire staff appears to be new.  We will have to try the 14th street location."}
{"text":"The owner of this place, the lady, can not smile.  Did you have a troubled childhood?  Smile a bit. I ordered the taco trios.  I got a sloppy mess of un-edibleness with hair.   The taco was basically a drippy mess.   Hey owner instead of speed making my food why not take an extra 3 second and drain the liquid from the shrimp.  I'm sure she would never eat this slop.  Hell if I was in maximum security prison I would not touch this crap.  And to say it's extra money for 12 morsels of corn.  You gotta be kidding me.  And I got hair in my food.  Go look at the pics.  Close down and make room for a better place."}
{"text":"Super fresh, fast, even has a drive through at this location!  Staff was very friendly, prompt and kept a clean and bright restaurant with four large screen TVs for entertainment.   We sat down, but can't wait to try the drive through."}
{"text":"Great, super healthy, fresh alternative to Subway and a way better feeling when you're done than fast food.   Taco Trio is a favorite in our household, but for myself I generally get the Burrito.  I first began filling up on them when I was working 16 hour days in Fort McMurray. Now I share them with one of my kids as there's so much I'll end up with leftovers if I don't."}
{"text":"Fast and affordable food.  It's by no means the best Mexican food in the GTA but for a chain in Scarborough it's about as good as you can get.  Burrito bowls tend to vary in size based on who's serving you, but it's usually quite filling."}
{"text":"This is a good place for a quick, tasty and healthy lunch. I always have the burrito bowl and they are generous with \"the fixings\" (beans, rice, tomatoes, corn, etc.) and combo comes with warm tortilla chips and salsa. Everything tastes consistently fresh.  Be forewarned that there's not a lot of seating in this small restaurant."}
{"text":"Pretty good Mucho, pretty damn good Mucho! One of the best fast food burrito places I have been to. Trumps that certain place named after a certain smoke-dried jalapeno.  When you arrive you're welcomed to a stainless steel display case red paint, light wood on chairs and walls, stainless steel table tops, plasma televisions, plenty of pot lights, and plenty of natural light.  What makes this place great is how they grill the burrito after assembly much like the burrito place that is popular with the after club crowd, you know the one evvveerryyone talks about located on Adelaide. The chicken tastes slightly smokey but sweet. You pick your own toppings to go in and they are also delicious. The rice has a hint of silantro, beans are tender but not mushy, vegitables are crispy but flavorful, and they offer diced jalapenos! These diced jalapenos elevate the flavors of the burrito to levels unimaginable. Their spicy sauce is actually spicy which is a nice change.   Portions here are very big. The medium sized burrito is the same size as larges elsewhere. Combos come with a drink and either chips, cookies, or a cinnamon roll. Beer is also served of the Corona or Dos Equis brand.   Overall, this place has great bang for buck and is the best tasting fast food burrito yet. The grilling to finish it off really does the trick and service is quick and friendly."}
{"text":"The food is pretty much standard as far as this franchise goes but the service is terrible, or should I say non-existent. I've been here a couple times. My first experience was mediocre but I found they're really cheap with the food. The only thing I eat here is the burrito bowl as I don't eat gluten. It's the same fillings as a burrito but just in a bowl, without the flour wrap around it. They scooped the rice into the middle of the bowl with a lot of empty space still in the bowl. Why do they make the bowls that size if they're not going to fill it? This is especially in comparison to the 4th St. SW (Mission) location which actually gives you A LOT!  The second time I went in there was only because I really needed something to eat at that time and it's pretty much the only \"quick\" thing around that area that I would eat. Anyway, when I went in this time there were only two other people in there who were already seated. I stood at the counter and the lady behind it was finishing up making food for the couple but she didn't even acknowledge me. So after standing there for a couple minutes I decided to use the washroom and when I came back the lady behind the counter was gone and there was another worker there sitting at one of the booths. I'm assuming he was on his break..fine. Then the lady came out bringing him some food and started talking to him and still has not acknowledged me, then she disappeared again. I waited for a few more minutes and still no one there to serve me. Needless to say I left. I thought there's no way I'm waiting anymore. There was no one else there!  Anyway, I will not ever go back to this location again! They have just lost a customer. They don't seem to mind losing business here though."}
{"text":"The closest to actual Mexican food this Southern California girl has found!"}
{"text":"Great place, generous portions of flavorful foods, fantastic service!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night.  Decor is not fancy typical fast food place.  I chose the TAQUERIA TRIO on the menu for a limited time (beginning of May I think).    Three soft flour (corn would have been better) tacos (one each chicken, pork and beef) priced $8.95.   I pulled this info off their news release so I could get a list of the ingredients.    Fiery Chicken Chorizo Fiesta: Grilled chicken, chorizo crumble, coleslaw, habanero fig spread, guacamole and sour cream.  Guacagrilled Pineapple Carnitas: Slow roasted pork, adobo mole sauce, grilled pineapple, red cabbage, guacamole and onion chips.  Mango Steak Tango: Grilled steak, green mango slaw, spicy aioli drizzle.    My daughter loved her quesadilla.  They make them to order with ingredients you select.     Flavourful Mexican fast food.  Staff was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Chipotle and good Mexican in general, so figured we would give this place a try as we were passing through the area.  They really did rip off pretty much everything from Chipotle, just didn't doo anything quite as well.  - Decor was almost identical to a Chipotle - Burittos very similar, not quite as good - Had loud Mexican music playing, made it hard to communicate with the staff.  Pick some more mainstream music, and control the volume - The chips and guacamole, skip them both.  The chips were no better than Tostitos, and the guac was just bad - Free kids meal on the weekend!  My son and I ate for $12.  Hard to beat that deal.  Price would be about the same as Chipotle otherwise.  So overall, a marginal reccomendation, seeing as there is no Chipotle nearby."}
{"text":"This place is your typical Canadian burrito chain. You choose what type of dish you want (ie. taco, burrito, quesadilla, salad) and you choose your meat or veggie option, then you choose your toppings.   I decided on a barbacoa burrito. The first thing I noticed was the lack of topping choices. They didn't even have lettuce as an option, I had to make a special request.   So the good thing is that everything seems pretty fresh but in general the burrito was pretty flavourless. I mean you can't expect too much for a chain burrito place but I have had better chain burritos in my life.   My burrito got completely soggy and fell apart while I was eating it and in the end I didn't even care that it fell apart because it wasn't that good to begin with.   The place was clean and the staff was friendly but I think I'll opt for other place next time because the food here was disappointing."}
{"text":"Burrito chains are all the rage lately, and Mucho Burrito's got a pretty good model - the menu isn't overwhelming, the prices are reasonable, the staff is friendly, the food is good, and THEY HAVE A LIQUOR LICENSE.  They aren't the best burritos I've ever had (but hey, it's a chain, what would I expect?), but they're reliable and decent. Definitely a good reliable place to run for lunch - and they're open into the evening (the reason this location got a liquor license, apparently)."}
{"text":"Delicious Mexican quick service food in SE Calgary on 130th ave.   Service is fantastic and you get to see what is put on your    and quesadillas.   Chips are crunchy and skimpy portions.   Children's menu comes with main entree, chips and juice box.   Dining area has 5 booths and rest are chairs. Live TV for viewing.   On the pricing side and comes very close to sit down restaurant price.   If you want to enjoy variety on 130th this is a great choice."}
{"text":"Massive burritos! Good priced. Only 4 star because it didnt have much seating. Put chipotle and qdoba to shame. Loved the burrito. Got the grilled chicken mucho with wheat tortilla."}
{"text":"They have a 5 dollar small burrito special going on with the purchase of a drink.. so I stopped in. Got a shrimp burrito! It was delicious. I had to wait 5 minutes because they cook the shrimp to order. Perfect portion and I don't feel like I overate. Definitely would get again :)"}
{"text":"Visited this place for a snack prior to watching a movie - and it was the ABSOLUTE WORST!  Meat seemed like it has been sitting there for days.  Sour cream had a funky taste. Chips were not fresh.  Now add a couple of miserable employees and you got the perfect recipe for disaster.  WILL NEVER RETURN. I also hope they close and something else would open up"}
{"text":"Mucho Burrito is a much better deal that other similar restaurants which offer pretty much the same, but much more expensive - sorry, I refuse to pay more than $8 for a burrito. The 10\" burrito is quite filling but for another $1.50- 2.00 you can get a 12\" which is massive. The toppings are generous and there is a wide variety of meat options, chicken, fish, pork, etc."}
{"text":"Came to mucho burrito and the store closed 2 hours early when the hours were advertised till 10 pm."}
{"text":"Great food and service!! Staff are friendly and the restaurant is clean. Lively Mexican music!"}
{"text":"Overall pretty good fast food. I had the taco trio and it was awesome with 3 different types of meat. The steak was a bit bland but the pork was juicy and flavourful. It was a little pricey and my tacos were not full. However, the joint was clean and I'd consider it a healthier version of fast food."}
{"text":"This place is a solid lunch spot. I'm here often. Great service, great food, can't go wrong with Mucho. Make sure you pick up an MTY points card on your way out."}
{"text":"This place is a solid lunch spot. I'm here often. Great service, great food, can't go wrong with Mucho. Make sure you pick up an MTY points card on your way out.  I knocked off one star because occasionally, they make mistakes and the food is subpar. It sucks when you order from DoorDash and can't get it fixed. But mistakes happen  Overall, great experience! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Once in a while there comes the greats, such as Michael Jordan, Prince, Gretzky, Ghandi. This local Mucho Burrito has given birth to simply the best burrito maker the world has to offer. He is a hidden celebrity amongst burrito lovers and the locals know him as simply \"The Burrito King\". His burritos are made with love, the right amount of sauces, toppings and even the sharpie \"X\" that he marks the wrapper. A man can be an artist... In anything, food, painting, whatever. It depends on how good he is at it. The Burrito Kings art is Burritos. Every burrito he makes is a Van Gogh. Just ask for the Burrito King to serve you next time you are at this location."}
{"text":"I was not as impressed with this location as I was at the one in Vaughn.  This location is small with limited seating, which is fine since they're catering to the business lunch crowd.  Some of the pork was a little dry and the mush they call salsa was pretty suspect.  The staff that were making the burritos were friendly and cheerful, but the cashier was grumpy.  Expect to pay $10 for lunch +/- $2 depending on the size of burrito you choose and a drink.  Overall it was a middle of the road burrito.  Its just disappointing since I had such a great experience up in Vaughn."}
{"text":"Supreme fast food..as close as you will find to Chipotle in the side of Plattsburgh.   New shop..not much around here yet. .but if you are not full from Costco samples..this is the place to come.   Nice selection of fresh toppings and very inexpensive. .under 15 dollars a person even with extras..drink included. Try all their hot sauces.   Very clean shop."}
{"text":"As close as Chipotle as we will get..Super clean and friendly. .fresh and inexpensive. Had the shrimps..happy I did!"}
{"text":"When it comes right down to it, this is fast food. There was nothing authentic Mexican about it.  On my first visit, I had a beef taco bowl salad. Although it was a pretty mess, it lacked flavour, despite all the toppings and dressings. I hardly tasted the beef.  I ordered a taco trio (chorizo, beef, and pork) on my next (and last) visit. The meat was dry and lacked freshness. Again, there just wasn't enough flavour.  For just a couple of dollars more, I can get much better tasting, more authentic Mexican food in a far more upscale atmosphere.  On the bright side, the place is clean and bright and the staff are friendly but I can't recommend the food."}
{"text":"Good food. Great service. Their portions are worth the cost. Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"This place is no Chipotle but since I don't have one near my house, this ends up being the place we grab a quick bite to eat at before going to the movies.   I used to love their soups, quesadillas and Nachos. But looks like they changed their food prep methods for the worse now.  Quesadillas: too cheesy and not enough veggies or beans. Nachos: they used to dress them up with the usual fixins and shredded cheese & then bake them. Now its just melted movies cheese whiz type stuff. Really? Absolutely disgusted. Soup: changed their broth to chicken now and it doesn't taste tex mex soup anymore.   I'd be curious to ask why?  Also, unlike Chipotle if you ask for more than one salsa it raises some serious eyebrows.....sad. So unless you are strapped for time. opt for one of the nearby sit down restaurants instead."}
{"text":"I ordered a Taco Trio for $9.  Generally, I found the food over-priced for what I got.  There were few pieces of fish in the fish taco.  The chicken meat was very dry in the chicken taco.  The pork taco was delicious.  Many people bought the burrito, but how did a lot of rice worthed $11?"}
{"text":"Eh. Nothing special here. The meat was cold, the default tacos were soft (I expected hard..and didn't realize until afterwards that I had to ask for hard, since the taco picture showed hard tacos), and you have to ask for napkins. The guacamole tasted like it came from a jar. It was fine for a quick mexican meal...but nothing I'd go out of my way for!"}
{"text":"The food was not as great as the reviews state. We arrived right when they opened and the food seem fresh. We ordered the burrito bowls and they lacked flavor. They were very bland, but the burrito sauce made up for the lack of flavor. The gentleman seemed a bit annoyed with a few of my request, but it was early, so maybe he was not yet prepared for the day. I would not return to or recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"After a fairly disastrous experience at the Mucho Burrito location in the Eaton Centre, I felt pretty confident that I'd never return to another location for the rest of my days. But I happened to be browsing the Ritual app and I discovered that the Mucho Burrito on Queen has a deal where you can get your first burrito for $5. Sold!  I went with a barbacoa burrito and asked for everything on it. Five minutes later, I walked into the joint and my burrito was just coming out of the press. Perfect!  It's a decent burrito. Though it'll never be mentioned in the same breath as Burrito Boyz, Mucho Burrito's offering satisfied my craving for an oversized concoction crammed with ingredients. There were a few problems, though. The ingredients were all pretty decent but the sautéed veggies didn't work for me. They infused the entire burrito with an out-of-place sweetness that was never not distracting.  Also, I had requested the burrito extra spicy and I would say it didn't even qualify as mild. Finally, the toppings were placed in such a way that you would get a bite that was just meat and then a bite that was just veggies, and that got pretty annoying after a while.  Still, I've certainly had worse and you can't go wrong with that $5 deal."}
{"text":"It never occurs to me to read Yelp reviews before hitting a food court, but I suppose I should've done that before ordering from this Mucho Burrito. (I don't know if I've ever seen an eatery with this many subpar reviews!)  Anyway, I ordered a regular beef burrito and asked for everything on it. The first thing I noticed was the person preparing my burrito put what amounted to about a tablespoon's worth of meat on it. (This is barely an exaggeration, sadly.) It seems ironic to me that a place called Mucho Burrito is delivering such puny, unsubstantial little burritos.  Mucho Burrito is also one of those misguided burrito joints that charges extra for guacamole. But I can't say no to guac, so I said sure. Would it surprise you to learn the guy hardly put any guacamole? I didn't think so.  The total for this minuscule parody of a burrito was around $11, which is absolutely absurd. Tastewise, it was fine, though completely lacking in spice (even though I specified extra spicy)."}
{"text":"Decent place. Service was fast, friendly and well trained. The place is nice and clean and I like how you can see your order being prepared. I had a Chicken (forgot the Spanish word..) Quesadilla and it was pretty good.  Ordered it with spicy beans, jalapenos and hot salsa but it was not hot.. Still, if in the area and in the mood worth a return visit."}
{"text":"Ok so quite disappointed and discussed with the service. It's been a while since I came here.  At the beginning I was able to mix to meats (not double the portion) and not they don't let and charge extra..  we ordered the taco and they were awful.. I wouldn't have paid .99 for them and these are 4.00 each. They were cold.. everything was cold.. the taco the meat and veggies .. we let them know and all they did is put it in the microwave .. yes 15.00 microwave taco. And it still was cold..  The service was not considerate and the place was empty (I can see why)  It's unfortunate after giving such a positive review that time that this is my latest experience. I don't recommend the tacos"}
{"text":"Wow...what a rip off.  I frequent other Mucho Burritos in Vaughan, and usually order the same items. There, my order comes to around $23. Last night I stopped here on the way to see Ross Petty's Pantomime at the Elgin Theatre (after misreading the start time on the ticket...didn't have time to go anywhere but a food court) and the same order came to almost $30....almost $7 more. I get that it's n a food court and in the Eaton Centre (and rent may be higher)  but come on!   When I placed my order, I asked for rice in my quesadilla (as I do in Vaughan) and was told \"no\"...that the panini press they use to heat the quesadilla would harden the rice. He said if I wanted rice, I'd have to get a burrito. I asked what they heat the burrito on and he pointed to the same panini press....so I said if they heat the burrito on it and it's ok, why wouldn't it be ok in a quesadilla. He just shrugged and said \"no\" again. I then said I'd risk the rice being hard and he said \"no\" again. So much for getting what you want.   They definitely need to hire staff that can make sense of a customers request.  Would not recommend this place and will never go to this location again."}
{"text":"This place is the worst mucho burrito I have been to.  I went on a Wednesday and paid full price for a 12 inch.  Let's start off with the basics of why this place fails so hard:  -Upsold immediately for something I didn't want (fine whatever that's normal I'll give them a pass). -Super cheap on the toppings.  Hope you like mainly tortilla. -Asked for further toppings and the server got a death stare from the manager like I was a begger asking for a free burrito.  For $10 I would never go here again. Should have just went to chipotle. No wonder it wasn't busy."}
{"text":"Their check in offer is great considering that the size of a small burrito is really all you need.   I had a small burrito and a few bites of the super quesadilla, both were good but the burrito packed more punch. With such fresh ingredients and service with a smile this is a great place for lunch or a quality bite on the go. If you're particularly hungry or have a big ol' stomach you can always ask for more rice/beans and they'll be happy to.   As for the negative reviews, I reported a couple for containing promo material for other businesses. People need to stop comparing one place to another and focus on the individual business. The team here obviously take care in cleaning and keeping things fresh. Their menu is diverse with different meat options, burritos, quesadillas, bowls, tacos and more. The price is still what you would pay at any other fast food chain but instead of processed and frozen you're getting something of higher quality."}
{"text":"This location is brand new and I suppose they still have a few issues to iron out. The staff is quick and friendly. The stir-fried veggies in the burrito were a bit too chunky (peppers and onions bigger than a toonie) and a bit too raw for my taste. Also, the final burrito was not warm all the way through, some parts were hot, some cold, however, the flavour is there, it's all very tasty with tangy guacamole and great salsas."}
{"text":"Still very good food, but I do have to remark on a recent lunch visit we had a server so stupid  she could have had a part in \"Dumb and Dumber.\""}
{"text":"Visited on Thanksgiving Sunday evening. We come here often but wanted to express how great it was tonight. Extremely clean, friendly staff and delicious food. And they have the Jalepeno hot sauce back (and they're not stingy about giving it to you)! Definitely the best Mucho Burrito in town."}
{"text":"Meh. Decent enough burrito (I definitely wouldn't get the so-called carne asada again though...seriously, stewing beef for carne asada? I understand you have to watch the costs but come on...) If I'm feeling peckish when I'm in the area again I'd definitely give the tacos a shot. Free chips and salsa with a drink purchase was a nice touch.   The burrito reminded me a lot of Burrito Boyz...not a lot of individual flavors like Fat Bastard, rather one big glop of flavor with some spice. Not a bad taste mind you, but nothing to get excited over.   Service was average at best. I caught the girl making my burrito at the end of her shift and she definitely didn't want to be there any more. Cashier couldn't really give less of a damn either.   Very nice decor and interior. Good spot for eating in.   Any food joint that stocks Diet Dr. Pepper earns an automatic star from me."}
{"text":"Rating:  1/2 star.  This an update from my previous review dated December 18, 2013.  We were shopping in Mississauga until late one Saturday evening and were so hungry that we decided to stop in at that 80 Courtneypark plaza and choose something from one of the many restaurants.  Since I had a previously good experience with Mucho Burrito, I suggested we go there.  I should have listened to my husband though because he told me that he would buy lunch for his employees every Friday and Mucho Burrito was one of the rotating spots. Apparently, the employees didn't want to order from it anymore because, on more than one occasion, Mucho Burrito was trying to pan off the regular size as mucho size - because they would call and pre-order, they never saw them actually assemble the burritos.  Anyway, my husband called the owner/manager to complain and, while he didn't admit guilt, he apologized and offered up some lame deal.  OK, so fast forward to my recent experience.  I placed my order with the most miserable, just rolled out of bed, clearly did not want to be there looking chick - she looked like she needed to take a good bath.  She was pissed that I ordered steak (carne asada) tacos (NOTE: slow-cooked beef looked like Alpo) but threw them in the warmer for literally three seconds and shoved them off for the some other woman to make them.  I should have paid attention while the other woman was assembling them because, when I got to my husband's office (less than five minutes away), I picked up the tacos and they just felt apart because (a) the tortilla (which was some No Name type brand to say the least) was still raw-ish; (b) there was a lot of watery hot sauce in the bottom of the tortilla; and (c) the tacos were placed in a paper plate type take-out box which, obviously, retains moisture.   I was so hungry that I ended up eating some of the filling but it had absolutely no salt or flavor that I just threw it out.  My husband ate a few bites of his nasty steak burrito, which, in my opinion, should just be referred to as \"rice burrito\" because that was the prominent ingredient.    One of my very worse dining out experiences ever.  Never, ever, ever again - I suspect they will be out of business soon anyway.  Disgusting."}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed mucho burrito but have add a few experiences that made me less eager to return.   This time was nothing like any of those times. The staff on duty today were amazingly helpful. I have to avoid garlic as much as possible because my stomach doesn't like it -- my taste buds do but Not my belly-- my husband asked them if there was I marinate meat and I said I need to avoid garlic. They didn't haste or question it, they checked ALL the ingredients without me asking, they cooked up shrimp with lime and oil no garlic and one fresh veggies without any sauce. It was all still SO delicious too, which is hard to get since us North American don't even know it's in literally almost everything! I had no idea until I started negatively reacting to it.   Anyways, they were so awesome and I didn't feel embarrassed as I normally would."}
{"text":"I tend to dislike franchise restaurants and actively try to avoid them when I can.  Although the lack of decent fast food joints has been slowly improving in the last few years, West Rouge still leaves much to be desired when it comes to variety.    Enter another Mucho Burrito location at the corner of Kingston and Rylander (just west of Port Union Rd).  Hubby and I visited the resto over the Thanksgiving long weekend for a quick meal before running our errands.  We were armed with coupons (otherwise I would not have gone there :p) for \"buy 1 burrito and get the 2nd burrito equal or lesser value for free\", we ordered 1 medio barbacoa (pulled beef) burrito with pico de gallo (your average salsa) smothered, 1 medio carne asada (marinaded steak) with pico de gallo and guacamole and a bottle of mango Jarrito (carbonated beverage).  The bill came to little over $12 for the whole meal so it was a great start.    Let me just say, I think they could probably use less people on the burrito assembly line as there were 6-7 people, each adding 1 or 2 ingredients before passing the burrito down to the next eagerly waiting staff.  Anyways....  My hubby's smothered barbacoa burrito came covered in a surprisingly pleasant chipotle tomato based sauce with black bean and corn kernels.  They skimped on the sour cream topping but all in all, the burrito was a lot tastier than I had expected.  Unlike traditional burritos where they use refried beans, they had used cooked pinto beans.  Other toppings included, mexican (or not so mexican) rice, cooked veggies (stir-fried sweet peppers & onions), cheese...etc.    My carne asada with guac was equally decent although I prefer my guacamole chunkier.  There is something very off-putting about smooth and pasty guacamole.  :p  My burrito was filled with pretty much the same fillings with the exception of pinto beans.  I had asked for black bean which were supposed to be a little spicier.   The most surprising part of the meal was their hot sauces.  I'm no pushover when it comes to spicy food but their mega hot was actually spicy!  This definitely earned them an extra star from me.    The one negative point was the uneven distribution of the fillings in our burritos.  The staff could take a little more care to distribute the fillings more evenly so every bite has a little bit of everything.    My first visit to Mucho Burrito was a pleasantly surprisingly one and I look forward to returning again next time I'm in the mood for something quick."}
{"text":"Before trying out Mucho Burrito, I checked out their website  http://www.muchoburrito.com/ and found out that I could join up the Mucho Burrito Club.  I did that last evening and received an email for buy one burrito plus a bottle drink and get a free burrito.  What a deal!    So, off we went to Mucho Burrito @ lunchtime.  We got the 19\" Shredded Beef Burrito on whole wheat tortillia with grilled vegetables, black pinto beans, shredded cheese, hot salsa (this is the hottest they had), chopped jalapenio chillies, cilantro, chipotle sauce and got the guacamole for an extra 99cents.  Rice also comes with it but we didn't want the rice.  The burrito got all bundled up and was put in a panini press to be warmed up and then wrapped up in foil paper.  The Shredded Beef was so good and quite tender.    Delicious meal in a wrap with a kick!  Got my seal of approval!"}
{"text":"Wanted to get the Mucho size burrito. Sold out in the middle of the afternoon. Asked for chicken meat. Sold out again. As the toppings were being added on I could see that the cheese tray was running empty but the server scooped whatever she could get and so I got minimal cheese on my burrito. Not a very good start and I haven't even taken a bite of my burrito yet. Asked for the churro's at the cash register. She said sure but at the end she still forgot to key it in the bill and I just about given up at that point and didn't even bother with the churro's. The burrito itself was okay but doesn't come close to Chipotle in terms of quality. The only good thing is that the portions were large. Maybe service was poorer than usual because this was during the ice storm and blackout but the food was not that great either."}
{"text":"One of the better burritos joints in Toronto. Too many of these places are the same, but I like the selection if ingredients here, for the most part anyway."}
{"text":"Worst experience with a burrito place. I'd consider this place fast food, so the service wasn't horrible as they really didn't have to do much.   The food was horrible. I think I eat burritos more often than I eat anything else & this place was a let down. First let's start with the prices. Why was two small burritos $25? Ridiculous, given their competitors prices are significantly less. Mind you, the prices were only this high because they charge you extra for more than 4 toppings and guacamole.   Now the toppings they offer are just gross. Cooked bell peppers, dry corn, cheese, basically nothing else. They don't even have lettuce... and on top of that, you can only choose 4! Guacamole is an extra $1.50 per scoop, I believe.  Not appetizing. The burrito itself for a small is $9.25.   I got the shrimp burrito & it just wasn't good. The burrito was dry, the toppings tasted old. Just a disgrace to a burrito, for the first time I couldn't finish one. Go to big bite burrito, only like 5-10 minutes from this location."}
{"text":"I live minutes away from Mucho Burrito but I usually just drive across the city to Costa Vida instead.  Why?  Because Mucho Burrito will either give you zero bell peppers or one entire raw pepper in your burrito.  They cut bell peppers in half instead of slicing them, it's honestly just a huge mouthful of peppers so always ask for no peppers.  Otherwise, the food is decent if you like Mexican, and I love it.  The drinks are overpriced, and the deserts take 10 minutes, but really the main issue is that they absolutely never slice the peppers small enough."}
{"text":"The first time I went was a few days after this place opened.  It was great.. Delicious, fresh and fast.  The second time I went wasn't as good, but the service was great.  The manager is really nice.  What happened was the girl making my burrito didn't roll it correctly or neatly and it started to fall apart as soon as I unwrapped it.  I went back to the counter to see if I could get them to re-roll it for me but the manager stepped in and made me a new one, rolled perfectly :)"}
{"text":"I love the idea do constructing my meal based on what I am craving at that moment.  And Mucho Burrito delivers on that.  I can choose a number of tastee meat options and construct the perfect burrito, designed by me and for me.  The burrito's are extremely flavorful and while I felt the prices are a touch high, that isn't a deterrent.  I will be back.  That said, I do agree, the guacamole shouldn't be a add on."}
{"text":"stopped in after a workout for a quick meal. I love the burritos but decided to try a salad instead. The service was incredible and friendly! And best of all my salad was fantastic. They cut me some fresh lettuce and the chicken was freshly cooked as well. high quality food for an affordable price!! will be back again for sure"}
{"text":"For the price, quality and freshness, this is a real deal.  Not like those pre-made ones at Wendy's but probably an unfair comparison.  You can get as much as you want so I asked for no beans and more avocado ;)  the churros isn't the best I've had but the caramel dip makes up for it, and way way too much, look at how much I've got left over.  Smaller location."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just had burritos from this location and we were very disappointed. We've had mucho burrito before, and we have never received such a small portion. Due to the fact that my boyfriend's burrito was literally half the size of mine, we decided we would have to split them half and half. I ordered guacamole, carrots, cabbage, and beans, but they only put it on one half. Sadly the half I got had nothing on it but plain rice. Very unpleasant."}
{"text":"I came here for a burrito sometime last year and I really liked it but recently when I went back, it was just ok. In my last visit, I ordered a steak bowl. The price was $8.5 which I think it a bit pricey. They do offer many different sizes of burritos ranging from small, regular, to mucho sized but my bowl was one sized. It came a bit watery I guess from the salsa. The portion size itself was great, quite filling. The taste of the seasoning was strong and the qualify of the ingredients was pretty decent however my meat was dry and tastes like it has been sitting for awhile. That and the watery-ness of my bowl brought down my rating of the place.   The restaurant itself has a nice chill vibe, and it's one of the only burrito places in the area so it's definitely a welcomed addition."}
{"text":"Last time we went, my friend got ill afterward.   When I went yesterday, I came down with food poisoning. The food looked like it had been sitting for a while. They only had crumbs left of the tilapia and asked me to pick a different kind. I thought I'd be safe with pork. Here's hoping that this is just a mild case of food poisoning."}
{"text":"This is a well run location near my office so I probably have lunch here every 3-4 weeks or so. Whenever the guy in charge sees me he gives me a big smile asking \"shrimp?\" and then he throws them on the grill to start cooking right away.  I usually get the shrimp quesadilla or salad and never finish as they are huge. I love their corn and black bean salsa and their pico is always fresh. Good guacamole too.  Clean, bright space."}
{"text":"Best chicken taco salad of my freaking life!  They absolutely loaded it with everything i could possibly want, and more. Brown rice on a salad? Who knew it would be so good?  The employee didn't seem annoyed at all when i kept asking for more and more cilantro and even joked and asked if I'd like some salad with my cilantro."}
{"text":"I've been avoiding this chain since it first came to Calgary because it seemed like yet another Mexican joint that filled all their menu items with rice, which I hate. But my family and I went there for a quick dinner this week and it was actually pretty tasty! Turns out they only stuff their useless carb grains into their burritos, but their tacos and quesadillas remain un-riced. My daughter and I shared a chicken quesadilla and it was really tasty! Lots of chicken, the tortilla was so soft and chewy like it should be, they put tons of veggies and cheese on it, and we got to choose our salsa from 5 different flavors and spice levels.  We were full afterward. My husband had the 3 taco dinner with three different meat choices and he loved all of them. I'd call it a win!"}
{"text":"Wow worst food I've had in a long time.  The food was cold the churro was hard like it had been cooked 4 times.  We came at 12:00pm which is lunch time.  This was our first time here and for sure is our last!!! Not even worth one star but zero wasn't an option. 35 for food for 1 adult and 2 kids and now we will be going next door for food."}
{"text":"Liked it. Amazing churios and burritos.  Cannot give 5 stars cus I feel the portion size is not as good as other Mexican restaurants I have been to. And that even though the burritos were good but they could have been better.  Otherwise the preparation is good, it's a nicely kept and clean restaurant. Have a variety of things on their menu.  Recommended. Must try this restaurant as it won't fail you."}
{"text":"Great food! Not necessarily authentic, but very tasty with good portion sizes. Try the chicken quesedila."}
{"text":"I'll probably never come back here again. I had the taco trios and shared it with my son. We had two chicken and one barbacoa. All the meats were so dry it was hard to swallow. My son didn't end up eating most of his and was picking out any meats that were soft. I don't know how they could be serving this to customers. I was greatly disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is good, but kinda expensive compared to other similar joints. You can build your own quesedilla, burrito, tacos, or salad bowl. I went for the burrito, which comes in pequeno (small), medio (medium), or mucho XL (self-explanatory). The guy immediately started pressuring me to get a bigger size, \"better value\" he kept saying. I ended up getting peer pressured into the medio, which was 12\" and very filling. I could finish it, but probably would get a pequeno next time. They have your usual options of chicken, pork or beef, but they also have tilapia, which you don't find at every burrito place, so I thought I'd try that. The fish was nice, lightly breaded. You can choose your toppings and the choices were pretty standard - rice, beans, cheese (thankfully they don't charge extra for cheese), different salsas, corn, cilantro, etc. They distribute the toppings well, which is good. Nobody likes to get all beans and rice, with all the good stuff on the bottom! Guacamole is an extra $1.25, which seems pretty steep, so I didn't get it. I got the medium spice salsa, which was very, very mild. So if you can handle it (I think you can), go for the HOT salsa! You can make it a combo for $2.50 -- fountain drink, tortilla chips, and salsa. They also sell soup and cookies."}
{"text":"I went with my girlfriend and it was under new management. The food portion reduced a great amount and the meats were dry. Not going back"}
{"text":"Wow, I just love this place! The food is awesome, fresh, flavorful and the portions are absolutely huge! The staff are always friendly and the place is always very clean. I wish there were more of them around...."}
{"text":"Really good Mexican fast food place. Went there today since they had their burritos for 5$ to celebrate cinco de mayo. Just like subway's system, you get to choose everything that's inside from the type of tortilla to guacamole which cost extra. The staff was friendly, helpful, fast and efficient making it easy for me to get the burrito I wanted. I got the pollo burrito with brown tortilla, vegetables, cheese, salsa and sour cream. It tasted really good, fresh, especially the chicken which was grilled perfectly and it wasn't messy at all. Overall a good place and I'll come back to try the quesadillas"}
{"text":"Mucho Burrito is very, very good.  And this from someone who lived in California for a decade and ate Mexican food at least twice a week while there.  For those familiar with the popular Chipotle chain, this is effectively a copy designed to serve the Canadian market, and is nearly identical in concept and in menu.  That said, I think Mucho Burrito is actually superior in at least the following ways:  - It offers the option of whole wheat tortillas - It offers fish in addition to the standard beef, chicken, and pork - The chicken is white meat (Chipotle uses a mix of white and dark) - It offers the option of grilled onions and peppers instead of beans (Chipotle may have this; I don't remember).  The reason I'm giving it four instead of five stars is that something was subtly lacking flavor-wise in the fish burrito I had.  I'll post a follow-up after I try something else..."}
{"text":"The concept is exactly like Chipotle, the ingredients are also about the same quality, but... Chipotle is better. The portions are really small for the price. I got a plate (because the theory is that you get more with a plate), but I was still hungry after eating it. My friend who got the large burrito had much larger portions. Disappointed and probably not choosing this place again."}
{"text":"I tried Mucho Burrito for the first time on Friday and I was pleasantly surprised!! I'd seen it before in the Suncor building where I used to work, but was always a little intimidated by the menu and I had no idea what to order. I then noticed that they opened a location in Crowfoot, and gave it a try for lunch. WOW!!! I ordered 3 tacos, 2 beef and 1 steak. They were excellent! I love the different condiments such as a variety of salsa and guac. Very flavorful and VERY good quality for a quick serve restaurant. The portions are a good size and everything tastes fresh. It's a bit more expensive than you're average Mexican place (think Taco Bell) but MUCH better, and better for you! We saw them cutting up the fresh steak for my tacos and I was hooked. Not to mention they serve beer here! I love how clean & modern the inside of the restaurant is. I left SO satisfied, and I cant wait to go back. I've found my new favourite lunch spot!"}
{"text":"I love Chipotle, so when I was craving a burrito bowl I settled for Mucho Burrito, assuming it wouldn't be too different - I was wrong.  The workers here give sad portions of everything and the bowl was small. I ordered the Premium Veggie Mix bowl and although it tasted fine, the amount of food I was given was just over half of what I could get at Chipotle. At Chipotle, I could get a larger meal for the same price ($10.11 incl. tax). How disappointing. You also have to pay a dollar more to put a tortilla on the side unlike Chipotle where (I believe) you could get it without being charged.  Next time, I'll walk over to the nearest Chipotle instead."}
{"text":"Typical chain burrito joint. None of the meats are made to order like higher end boutique places, rather made in bulk and chopped up and put into buckets. The person that makes the burrito always does the cash which is gross."}
{"text":"Restaurante simples e que fica localizado ao lado do cinema e de diversos restaurantes. Possui wifi no local. A comida nao é ruim mas achei o frango da minha quesadilla meio sem gosto. Classifico o local como regular pra uma refeição sem nenhum propósito."}
{"text":"so there's a large curbside sign caught my attention. thought I'd try this relatively new location.  I needed lots of help ordering, young staff eager to assist.  I got a Burrito,   choice of 3sizes, white or whole wheat, chicken, beef, pork,  tons of toppings .   It was fresh , big portion, and reasonable price.  Try it out!!"}
{"text":"This place kicks ass. They make ten times the burrito you'll get anywhere else, and best of all they make it FAST. Whole wheat option, brown rice option, and be sure to try the tilapia - takes a couple extra minutes to grill up fresh, but it's great. Don't buy the Chipotle hype, don't waste 15 minutes of your life at Burrito Boys, just go here and enjoy a consistently excellent burrito. (Trust me, I've had at least a couple hundred of them by now.)"}
{"text":"Mex seems to be becoming \"the thang\" now. Mucho is doing a great job of providing great fresh food at a reasonable price. Nothing is processed. Two fish burritos on the menu (compare that to Chipotle with no fish)."}
{"text":"Fast food places are fast by definition.  Those located in a busy food court are super fast.  This Mucho location is no exception. Come noon, the long line snakes along the walls of the concourse when the hungry rank and file of the Toronto Financial District descend for a bite of natural goodness reminiscent of a hot afternoon in Playa Del Carmen...uhhh....   Whoops, I think I just got carried away.   The food served here is Mexican in style. Thank goodness, the promptness of service is anything but Mexican. It's more akin to a well-tuned production line, with one person taking your order, another rolling your burrito, and the third swiping your credit card. Fun to watch!  Mucho is a Canadian franchise started by the guys who saw the success of companies like Chipotle in the US and decided to cash in on that here. Good on them!   And good for us too.  Because in the process, they improved the product, and not just created a knock off of what was already there.  So in addition to all these carnitas and chicken and other meat choices, we have fish (tillapia).   Also, all or most of the entrees can be ordered as burritos (as one would expect), tacos (I tried that and I don't recommend) or soup (that was actually not bad at all).  And did I say these guys were fast? Yea, I know I did.   But they're SOOOO fast!"}
{"text":"Bootleg chipotle still pretty good!  Expensive for small portions"}
{"text":"This is a go to spot whenever we don't know what we want for supper. I'm suprised we hadn't discovered this franchise before last year. Love being able to get fast food with a little less guilt.  Our regular order is a mucho sized carnitas burrito, stuffed full of all the toppings we can get. The quantity of the items varies from time to time depending on the person making the burrito... shall I call him a \"burrito artist\"? They are always super accommodating when we ask for our burrito to be toasted extra long. As we find that it sometimes doesn't survive the trip home if we don't...  I've had a variety of their menu items like their nachos, tacos, and quesadillas. All of the selections were pretty good, and I'm very happy that we can customize it to be \"vegetarian\" as well. The nachos are a bit messy to eat, but its supposed to be a messy food anyways. If you're able to catch them making churros fresh, they are to die for!  For those with small appetites, they do offer a kids menu as well. I've ordered those for a quick snack for those hectic nights rushing off to work. Overall, not a bad choice for \"fast food\". Much better than hitting up a burger place, albeit not as convenient to eat on the go. The meal could get pricey though, as getting a mucho sized burrito can run up a bill of at least $11."}
{"text":"Pretty rare that i would give any place 5 stars but all the layers of flavors bouncing around my taste buds hit home with a bang.  Pretty quiet here tonight but the friendly staff and the latin music make for a good ambiance.   I had a smothered burrito that just defined tasty right down to the southwest tomato sauce to crown it. Oh and make sure you kick it up with some of that ghost pepper hot sauce it will warm up a chilly  night. That is....if you ain`t afraid!!!    Gonna be putting this joint on my frequent visit schedule. Probably helps that it`s close to home and there`s not much around these parts other than the same ol`stuff."}
{"text":"THE BEST Mucho Burrito I've ever been to! I usually get a small Carnita or Barbacoa burrito and it is PACKED. Seriously, every other Muchi Burrito (specifically the Major Mac/Weston and Eatons Centre) needs to sit down because their sizing is an insult to all other venues serving burritos for the same pricepoint. This location will serve it up for you! Won't visit any other MB after experiencing this one! Packed with flavour. Their washroom could be maintained better but hey, the food is awesome. Will come back and would recommend 10/10. I personally prefer the carnitas (pork) over the barbacoa (beef). I had their steak before and I didn't like it, but different friends have been saying its good/bad, so when it comes to this MB's steak, to each their own! Oh and couple other things! Personally I don't think the chips/nachos are worth it. And their tables are stuck to the floor, so groups larger than 4 may be sitting in awkward smaller groups."}
{"text":"Decent food , reason for three stars is being that they are small portions for what you pay, bought chips and salsa ....what a joke like 3 table spoons of salsa comes with it lol...usually salsa shouldn't be a big deal but to mucho burrito its a luxury lol ...too much micro managing when I wanted more salsa to finish the rest of my  micromanaged bag of chips they charged me for another 3 table spoons !.Money is not the issue its the principal....I understand running a food business is not cheap but come on Mucho salsa??? Really???? Its really cheap to make.....plus doesn't hurt to make salsa portions bigger ...Never Again!  Sorry just being honest."}
{"text":"pay extra for guacamole!??? omg. no way! burrito boys still much more amazing especially being right near by! would not return to this location. burrito is not bad though, but much better options out there around this location"}
{"text":"so i ordered chicken soft tacos and you get three tiny little soft taco things with average tasting chicken on it and they charge you hella cash guacamole costs extra which is dumb because if ur getting a burrito or a taco you basically need guacamole ive heard the burritos are v delicious but also pricey 4 what u r getting so in conclusion this place tastes good but b prepared to still b hungry and if ur poor like me this is very $$$$$$$$"}
{"text":"Ordered the small shrimp burrito with brown rice. The rice was stale and hard. They were pretty cheap with adding the bell peppers and cheese. The wrap wasn't satisfying at all. I would have thought a $10 wrap would be filling and yummy but instead it was cold and stale tasting."}
{"text":"Mucho lacklustre. No refried beans and they use mixed greens instead of iceberg lettuce which was kind of weird. I did really like the edamame and sweet potato medley, also kind of weird but it worked well with the other flavours and textures. The best part of Mucho Burrito has GOT to be the hot sauces. They have a large variety of DIY hot sauce choices including habenero, jalapeño, scotch bonnet and chipotle! I wish they would offer these options to incorporate IN your burrito as opposed to just an after thought. They're really good and if you're not using them on your burrito you are straight up doing yourself a disservice."}
{"text":"Been to this location several times.  They are often out of shrimp, or fish as previous reviews have mentioned.  And the staff is EXTREMELY reluctant to make you fresh. Usually saying \"please just choose another meat\". The tables are often cluttered with trays/napkins/garbage. Staff are polite enough and service is usually pretty quick.  BIGGEST PROBLEM though - they are not practicing safe food handling guidelines. Not sure if it's the chaffing dishes, or the employees not washing hands, or maybe the refrigerators are not cold enough - but I've been 3 times over a period of a couple of months and I ALWAYS get mild-moderate food poisoning. First two times were just \"the trots\". But last Saturday I went and was VIOLENTLY ill, from both ends. I did not have the flu, as anyone with a brain knows there is no such thing as \"a 24 hour bug\". Food poisoning plain and simple. First two times I wasn't sure it was the Burrito but this last Saturday there is no doubt as I hadn't eaten anything else that day, and the previous day had only been fully cooked mild food from home.  I've contacted management, I eventually got a response of \"since you weren't diagnosed by a doctor - it's probably just allergies\". VERY UNIMPRESSED.  I WILL NEVER set foot in this location again, and will likely never return to a mucho burrito period."}
{"text":"I had the chicken burrito. Tasted good but I wouldn't recommend eating it in the car. Very messy and lots of juices flow out onto the paper. Service is fast. Staff friendly. Would go back."}
{"text":"Delicious freshly pan seared tilapia tacos and barbacoa burritos!"}
{"text":"We've went to mucho burrito many times in the past and have always really enjoyed the food but this time we both ordered a veggi burrito (actually wanting the shrimp but the cook time was 10 minutes and we were in a hurry).  The burrito was definitely lacking as it appeared that most of the ingredients were quite old and this left the food stale. My fiancée was served first and got the old veggies. Then they added new veggies on top of the old ones in the warming dish, but the peppers were still very raw.  The beans were terribly cold and the sauces (sour cream and chipotle) were very runny.  The tortilla chips that came on the side were so tasteless.  Overall a very bland meal which was such a disappointment as we've always made this a destination when travelling to Calgary."}
{"text":"Always an easy meal, a lot of food at a great price. Had the small vegi burrito and I'm still so full.  Love that they don't add meat to their beans."}
{"text":"worst burrito place i've ever been to.  The food is extremely bland with no taste.  The franchise focuses more on quick service but overlooked quality and taste.  I highly recommend you stay away from this one!"}
{"text":"Such a stingy place.  I came at CLOSING and asked for extra vegetables and they gave me attitude like I was taking their natural resources and impacting their bottom line.  Forgive me for being a hungry mall wanderer!  Pros: Quick service (No one was in line!)  Cons Stingy Gave me attitude for asking for more. Like it was a handout."}
{"text":"more like Mucho Crap, they are so stingy on toppings it was like the girl was measuring everything out, Quesada on cote st catherine piles on the ingredients.  When I asked why it's this way the Asian woman told me it's enough.... lol never again.. and they don't even have different varieties of sauces to choose from!  I even had to pay extra for avocado on a veg burrito!"}
{"text":"Located in the Food Court of the Bay-Adelaide Centre, this Mexican fast-food joint makes some exceptional burritos. They are well priced, fresh, and taste very authentic (I believe) - it helps that all (most) of the staff working has an amazing Latino accent.   Watch out for the line up there, which starts around noon and lasts until 1pm.   I would give them an extra star if they didn't charge you 99c for only a little bit of guacamole."}
{"text":"This used to be my go-to place for burritos in the Core but unfortunately the quality of food and service has been steadily going doing down during 2014 and 2015.  You will get lost in the prep process unless you know exactly what you want in the order that they make the burrito. The prep line staff doesn't speak up and doesn't guide you (like Chipotle or BB), I've seen plenty of newbies get lost as the staff just stares without communicating. On the other hand, if you're pro level and decide to tweak your burrito (no rice or beans, mixed meats, multiple salsas, properly pronounce ingredient names) expected to be greeted by deers caught in headlights, even when they're not busy.  Lately I've been getting very bland rice and beans, I guess they're hoping that offering to drown your burrito with cheese and salsa will hide that (hint: doesn't work). And the meat portions keep getting smaller and smaller, a Regular would be a Small in most other places.   Finally, be weary of their salsas and guacamole, not fresh and not worth the extra charge."}
{"text":"I am surprised at the poor reviews for Much Burrito!  The food is very tasty and moderately priced.  Much better than all those cheap taco places."}
{"text":"Good food, nice service.  The food is good, they have a nice variety of hot sauces. The only problems are that they charge extra for extra cheese, which is ridiculous, and they grill the burrito at the end, and mine ended up burnt on the bottom, so maybe ask for them to be careful, unless you like burnt burritos.  Another interesting thing about Mucho Burrito in general is the fact that they have different sizes of burritos, so you could get a huge one if you're really hungry, or a small one if you're not super hungry, etc. I got a normal size one and it was fine and filling as a dinner.  The workers are nice, helpful, etc.  Honestly, it's not as good as Chipotles, but this is a 10 minute drive which is way easier than going to Toronto/Scarborough.  If you want a good burrito and good service, this is the place."}
{"text":"We have been to several Mucho Burritos in Ontario and this one in the best we have seen so far. I had my burrito with half chicken and half chirozzo and it was delicious. I am giving it 4 stars (rather than 5) as my burrito was dropped to the counter and no apology was given. Yet, we will be back :-)"}
{"text":"I recently discovered burritos as a fast-food option and I'm now wondering what I've been doing with my life. I understand purists will shy away from Mucho Burrito because its a franchise but I have enjoyed myself the handful of times I've been to the one at Markham Road and Sheppard Avenue in Scarborough.  I'm not sure of the actual names of the burritos I've had but they've all involved some sort of shell, meat, veggies and sauce and they've all been tasty. I also appreciate that everything I've ordered I haven't been able to finish so I bring it home with me.  Don't get me wrong, the decor has all the warmth of an undecorated artificial Christmas tree but you know what? When I'm at Mucho Burrito it's to shove Mexian-esque fair in my face and leave with a full belly and a desire to visit that washroom at the far end of the building no one ever uses for some good reading time and Much Burrito delivers!  TO SUM IT UP: Not a burrito snob but love the idea of a burrito? This is the place for you. Just don't open your eyes while you're eating and imagine you're in a Mexican villa for the full effect."}
{"text":"Mucho Burrito has the best burritos I've ever tasted. This location is wonderful, there's lots of space to eat and is very clean. The staff and owners/managers are very friendly and if it's your first time they excitedly guide you through the whole process. It's an assembly line sort of like subway. Order first, pay later. My food is always made in a record amount of time and if there's ever a wait they make sure to let me sit while one of the employees brings it to my table. The guacamole is 99 cents extra for most things (besides mucho burritos, vegetarians and i think salads) but I get it every time because it's worth every penny. It's not just plain boring avocado like most places, but actually had diced tomatoes in it. It's a bright green and not a sickly pea color like most burrito places and tastes amazing. The meats are all wonderful, however the steak is usually a little too chewy and there is often a 5-10 minute wait for fish. They're much more generous with toppings than a lot of places I've been too. To this day I still have no idea how the staff manages to roll the jam packed burritos! They press the burritos for just several seconds, making it warm but not crunchy like a lot of other places here that give that burnt taste. The mexican music that plays all day, paired with the unique decor really makes you feel like you've taken a trip to Mexico! Everyone I have referred to this location has been very pleased with their experience and I would definitely recommend it to anyone, as I eat here multiple times a week during my lunch breaks."}
{"text":"Mucho Burrito is my favourite \"fast food\" place. I like seeing employees actually cooking real chicken breast when I go. It's reassuring. The meals are great, I've tried almost everything on the menu, except salad (no thanks). The shredded beef burrito is my favourite. They offered a watermelon and some other fruit infused beverage for a while, it was pretty awful; It may be gone now. One time I saw an employee squirt ghost pepper(very hot) sauce into his eye while working. It brightened my day for some reason."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Mucho Burrito for a healthly fast food option. I always get the medium chicken burrito (they have steak,pork,fish as well) with whole wheat tortilla. The veggies are fresh the chicken is good and it always fills me up. They have an extra large buritto that I attemped only once, it is way to much food. I go here quite a bit to the location on 130th ave SE. The staff remember me and always greet me with Mr. Mark. Its not top of the line Mexican but for the price it is well worth it."}
{"text":"Found  a big piece of chicken in my vegetarian mucho burrito. Not cool. Staff need to pay more attention. Not cool at all."}
{"text":"My corporate office is nearby and a co-worker was SUPER excited that there was a Mucho Burrito available for our lunch. As someone else noted, it's a similar concept to build-your-own burrito places we have in the US like Chipotle, Qdoba or Baja Fresh. (Except in the States, there is only one size - ginormous - because US peeps are all gluttonous)  Anyway, I like to defy convention so I ordered tacos at a burrito place. Actually, they were pretty decent. The carnitas meat was well seasoned and not fatty and the hot salsa was actually HOT. You can pick your toppings which is always nice.   Mucho Burrito claims to be \"Toronto's Best Mexican\". Who am I to argue with that claim?"}
{"text":"This Mucho Burrito is located right at Taunton and Brock in the massive Walmart/Loblaws plaza. My boyfriend and I came here on our way back from the cottage, hungry and wanting something fast to take home with us.   I've eaten at Mucho downtown and have never strayed from the fish burrito but feeling adventurous, I decided to try the pork this time. I always end up with the smallest size burrito because they're just HUGE. If you aren't a big eater, start with the smallest size and add some nachos on the side just in case you're not full. I piled mine high with everything that was offered (rice, beans, veggies, cheese, sour cream, guacamole (0.99 extra) and the girl had a hard time getting it closed.   I have to say that the pork just didn't do it for me. Christopher L was right by saying that its a lot of filler and not a ton of meat. It's easy to get sidetracked adding all kinds of stuff into your burrito. My pork got lost in the burrito and while I love toppings, they just overshadowed what was supposed to be the main attraction.  Overall, not a bad experience but I think I'll stick with the fish next time. It's got a flavor that stands up to all the toppings and really brings everything together. The service here was nothing to write home about - they really made me feel like just another burrito, no interaction, no smiles, nothing. That's probably what made this experience mediocre - the staff at the Eaton Centre location are so very friendly, outgoing and chatty with their customers, always making suggestions of what to add and offering samples and whatnot. These guys should take a lesson from the Mucho downtown!"}
{"text":"My coworker and I wanted something quick and easy for dinner and we ended up deciding on Mucho Burrito - I had yet to try this massive burrito craze that's been sweeping across the city and I figured it was as good a time as any!  As someone who watches what I eat, I was sooooooo happy to find full nutritional information on their website. Not only did they break everything down, but when we got our wraps made, they actually use a measuring spoon to measure out all of the ingredients, so the nutritionals are pretty accurate. I was easily able to decide what I wanted before we went down to order.  When we got there, the guys behind the counter were nice but eager to serve us, asking us if we wanted this and that, when we were still deciding what to get. I wanted to get the smallest size wrap but they upsold me one size more (from 10\" to 12\" - they also have a 14\"). I ended up choosing the fish and adding all the good toppings, sour cream, rice, cheese, medium salsa, veggies, the works. They wrapped it all up and then we got a choice of having cookies or nachos, I went for nachos and a drink. All in, it was pretty reasonably priced and when they handed me the burrito I was appalled at how heavy it was!!  I couldn't have asked for a better burrito experience - YUM! The fish was perfectly cooked and well seasoned, tasted amazing in the burrito and all of the topping were great, the lime rice, the veggies, everything - just amazing! In future, i would definitely NOT get the larger size as it was way too much food for me (even for dinner); I'd stick with the smaller size and even then I'm sure it would be too much for me.  Overall, a great first burrito experience - amazing flavor, ridiculous portions and super fresh food!!"}
{"text":"Got the mucho burrito which was gigantic!!!! The toppings were fresh and contained a lot of meat. Their sauce adds a lot of flavour to the burrito to keep it interesting.  It was a hassle to eat the burrito considering the size. Almost half of my toppings fell and things can get messy!"}
{"text":"This location has gone downhill recently.  Ordered a veggie burrito bowl.  Typically when ordering a veggie, they will ask if you want more veggies to compensate for not having any meat.  My veggies were not topped up and I received the same amount as my friend did who ordered their burrito with chicken.  There was also minimal rice and the girl who helped us was quite stingy with the rest of the toppings as well. My completed order barely filled half the bowl.  Too expensive for too little food.  I finished my meal and was still hungry."}
{"text":"I love the Mucho Buritto in Vaughan (Hwy 7/Jane and the one on Weston/Major Mackenzie). But this particular one at Courtney Park is TERRIBLE. It was cold, chicken tastes rubbery and did not taste FRESH at all. Also when I asked for more vegetables, I was told \"maam this is the serving size\". And I can tell you that it isn't because I have been to many Mucho Burritos and I get way more veggies then he that. They cheap out on that. The service is slow. There is a lack of communication and it made the line go so slow. I am never going back."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure about this place since I thought it was just a glorified fast food burrito place...which, it is...but the burritos were SO tasty and not dry and amazing.  I thought it was a little pricey but I am....well I don't want to say cheap, but let's say frugal. You do definitely get what you pay for though....I wasn't hungry for the rest of the day. Sometimes I'll get burritos and they will be heavy and packed but dry as heck and not very exciting. This was definitely NOT the case here, the rice was nice and the meat was not overcooked at all.  I will be definitely coming back :)"}
{"text":"I just ate the best burrito I've ever had according to recent memory.  I'm picky when it comes to eating beef and don't often take a chance, but their marinated, slow cooked and shredded beef is top notch for fast food as far as I'm concerned.  It's flavorful and yet doesn't overpower the other delicious ingredients such as the cilantro lime rice or the sauteed peppers and onions.  I was hungry and even though the size small 10'' burrito I ordered felt like a brick, I managed to eat the entire thing, mostly because I couldn't stop.    This place is nicely decorated and was very clean.  They were non-stop busy too.  I was happy to see a few larger tables and benches, as I met a client here and we had lots of room to spread out paperwork, etc.  The traditional Mexican music they were playing made me feel like I should be sitting on a beach with a Corona.    I won't need to eat for many hours as my meal was hearty, but the lingering smell of Much Burrito in my hair will have me daydreaming of more Barbacoa."}
{"text":"I really like their crowfoot location . This one is very stingy with their portions, to the extent that I got a half-size burrito compared to other locations. They also insist on serving only two sauces and apparently lettuce is not a part of the burrito anywhere. Taste is bland.   Staff acts as if they are doing a favour or giving the burrito for free. Sadly, there are limited options for reasonably priced food in the area, which is why this business is still surviving."}
{"text":"I had to stare at the menu for awhile before ordering because of words like pequeno and carne asada. The person in front of me was getting annoyed and actually snapped at the cashier for not including a bottle of water in her order. She seemed to be ordering a lot for her family.   I ordered a meat quesadilla with guacamole for a take-out. It was pretty tasty like quesadillas in other non-Taco Bell places. The meat looked like it's been there for awhile and tasted dry. The veggies and the sauces (sour cream, hot sauce and guacamole) were yummy. I'd try this place again for a burrito next time I'm out for lunch."}
{"text":"If you eat at this place -- when there is a Jimmy Guacos across the road -- you should start looking for a good gastroenterologist now.  I've been to Mucho Burrito several times.  Staff?  Rude.  Food?  Poor.  Prices?  ARE YOU KIDDING ME?  THIS IS A BURRITO SHACK, NOT THE KEG!  I'd walk across hot coals to eat at Jimmy Guacos.  I wouldn't walk across a crack in the sidewalk for a free meal at this pit.  And for the record, I do NOT work there, I am not RELATED to anyone who works there, and I'm not getting kickbacks for this review.  I just love good food, and this place does NOT serve good food."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Mucho Burrito. We were there pretty early (11:00 a.m.) on a Saturday and were happy to see that they opened at 10:30 a.m. As soon as we walked in, we were greeted by a \"Welcome to Mucho\" from one of the servers behind the counter.  The three of us opted for burrito bowls instead of burritos inside of a tortilla. We liked that there were plenty of topping choices such as Mexican rice, cilantro rice, black beans, pinto beans, grilled veggies, 3 kinds of salsa, cheese, sour cream sauce, guacamole and several different meats.   Between the three of us, we had the carne asada, chorizo and barbacoa. All three of them were really tasty. We were all impressed with how filling they were and thought they were a good value for money.   There were 5 different kinds of hot sauce available to add to our burrito bowls, but unfortunately most of the bottles were almost empty.  Other menu options were tacos, taco salad, quesadillas, nachos, desserts and several different beverages.  The inside of the restaurant was very clean and bright and there were plenty of tables for seating. The washrooms were also very clean. There were 2 wall-mounted TVs with one showing sports and other showing a news channel.  All in all, it was a good meal and we'd definitely return to Much Burrito."}
{"text":"Friendly service and a Mucho size burrito is more than filling. Also, Mucho Burrito uses fresh ingredients which is a plus. Mucho size burrito includes 2 types of meats, I got barbacoa and carnitas. Both were pretty good together. Overall, Mucho Burrito is good and definitely better than Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Amazingly efficient with consistent flavors!  Many places such as this one have those bad or me'h days when you find stale veggies or dull chicken. Not this one. The way they prepare my naked burrito is beyond awesome. And generous cilantro, yum! Not too pricey either and plenty of space to park your butt inside and your car outside."}
{"text":"I've been twice since this location opened. The food quality and service are both good. I find that the burritos (I've tried the barbacoa and the chorizo) to be more filler than meat so the flavors of the meat get masked. For what you get it's rather expensive, over $10 if you get the 'mucho' size and most of that is rice. Also, charging for guacamole if you don't get the largest size seems a tad greedy, at least cheese is included...."}
{"text":"We pit stopped here yesterday for some lunch whilst on our road trip. I ordered the small chicken burrito and asked for it to be hot. Usually when I make such requests, I am sorely disappointed as the spice level barely registers on the heat scale. This was not the case here, as this one packed a punch. I was also impressed that there was actually a reasonable amount of chicken in it.   The restaurant itself was clean and more comfortable than your average fast food place. And our dreadlocked server was very friendly too. In short, if you need a quick bite, this place is totally viable."}
{"text":"I don't usually eat \"fast food\" but lately I've been lazy so I thought I'd try this place and it is pretty good. What made me go there in the first place was because I was looking for something I could bring on the flight I had to catch that day. I had passed by this place so many times on my way home from work so I decided to check out their menu online beforehand. They actually have something I can eat there. As I'm gluten free I knew I could order the burrito bowl with chicken.   So when I pulled it out to eat it on the plane the lady beside me commented on how good it looked (as she was eating her cheese and crackers she just bought on the plane). We hadn't talked up until this time and then we ended up having a conversation the rest of the way to Toronto, totally initiated by my meal. Ha! Then the flight attendant passed by and noticed my food she also said, \"that looks good, a lot better than what we serve.\" She looked like she wanted some. haha She's right though, it was good despite the fact it obviously wasn't hot anymore by the time I ate it, but still tasty. And I like to be prepared especially when it comes to food as I have food issues and I'm pretty selective with what I eat. I have to say it tasted as good as it looked. It was a quick and easy option and a pleasant surprise!  I've been to this location of Mucho Burrito a couple more times since then.The service has always been good. They're always smiling and friendly. And they are quite generous with the portions. The burrito bowl is the only thing I eat there. I go there when I need something quick and I'm feeling lazy and don't want to make something for myself."}
{"text":"My favorite place for a fast food burrito. The ingredients are fresh, tasty, and the burrito is quite filling-- even for a small. The employees are polite."}
{"text":"Toronto boasts no lack of burrito options.   From international megacorporations, to local chains, to one-off mom-and-pop shops, you could safely dad-joke that Toronto puts the T.O. in burriTO.   As burrito competition expands faster than a diner's waistline, you'd expect each shop to try and outdo the others; in portion size, innovative menu items or plain old friendly customer serrvice.   Sadly, this location of Mucho Burrito fails on every front.   Located in the sprawling basement food court at the Eaton Centre, bored servers act as though they've got the market cornered when they barely have the South-West Corner of Yonge and Dundas.  Signage is loud, and new specials are constantly on offer. Wanna try a ghost pepper burrito? It would melt your face off if they actually bothered using the right sauce.   Questions about ingredients are met with indifference as they occasionally poke their sweaty proteins and swill-swimming beans in their steam trays.   Sad scraps of produce mix between plastic containers as though, in a fit of depression, a burritorista couldn't bring himself to tighten his fist, leaving a corn-kernal trail of despair through lettuce and sour cream and blue-fuzzed pre-shredded cheese.   Can a burrito itself be apathetic? Mucho Burrito would say \"si\", then yawn. An insufficiently steamed or griddled shell disintegrates on its way to the table.   It contains mostly gluey rice; maybe a few slopped-out beans, a carnita string or two-somehow dry and tough despite submersion in orange grease-water, single-digit thinly sliced vegetables and stingy sauces.   Oliver-Twist like requests for a more bountiful burrito are met with derisive snorts. Sure I can have more, if I pay extra...while every other burriteria welcomes requests for an extra scoop of peppers, or onions, or will grant you the privilege of dividing your proteins at no extra charge.   I stare at the half-built burrito sadness in front of me and swear it will be a new day. I have options, darn it!   I whisk my credit card away from the Sarlacc Pit of a manager and blinking, step into the sun...and the fields of burrito shops on the horizon.   Just North West...I think I'll hit Chipotle instead."}
{"text":"Quite disappointed in this location, I love mucho burrito usually.  I order the veggie burrito and this location 2 times now has only had green peppers and a little onion.  Their sour cream is watery, and they are very stingy on the cheese.  I feel that they're cutting costs on their products and you can really see and taste it.  I recommend going to another location if you're craving mucho.  I personally will never go back to this place"}
{"text":"Before Burrito boys came into the scene I may have given this place 4 stars but now there is no chance. I don't mean to harsh because this place isn't bad. However, it is not memorable enough for me to eat here again unless I had limited choices. The protein selection was decent but I found the salsa and sour cream very watery. Half way through my second taco they started to get soggy. They also have limited amount of free toppings before thy start adding on those extra charges. I really enjoyed my chips and guacamole but for 15 dollars I've had better. If I ever come back I will try their quesadillas (I've never had a bad quasadilla)."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend bought burritos to bring inside the movies a few nights ago. To my surprise the burritos actually had good flavour. The hot sauce was actually hot unlike most places that promise you spicy and never deliver. However, I am only giving mucho burrito 3 stars because they still are not better then burrito Boyz. Burrito Boyz has more ingredients to choose from, different proteins (halibut, shrimp and tofu), they actually grill their burritos till they are warm and crunch (I'm sorry but that panini press at mucho burrito doesn't do your burritos justice) and its cheaper. So once all those things are improved I may rank you higher than burrito Boyz but until then they are my first choice."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed. Been here a couple of times. Each time I come, the portion sizes get smaller. I literally got half a burrito bowl for $8.25. Even stingy on the green beans. There were 6 green beans. I guess because it's cinco de mayo? I guess it's time to find a new place."}
{"text":"Mucho adieu about nada. This uninspired but still beloved Canadian Burrito joint was a very weak experience long on promise but short on delivery.  So unimpressive that I'm having a hard time remembering which mediocre items I had. You won't die from it, but it was not a good example of Mexican food. I keep forgetting I'm in suburban Toronto, so my expectations are probably out of wack. Or the food was wack. Probably both. I guess if I had not eaten Mexican food in years, and was craving it, I might cave and eat here again, but otherwise, I'm being generous with 3 stars."}
{"text":"I go here on a somewhat regular basis, mainly because it's close to my house.  The first thing you'll notice when you walk in is that the staff won't like you.  They're not the most friendly sort, and I've only seen them smile when talking to each other.  Their goal is to get you to pay and then leave as soon as possible.  Aside from that, the food is okay.  I've been to other Mucho Burrito locations where the burritos tasted much better, but this one does in a pinch.  The guacamole is pretty bland, and it tastes like one of those gross guacamole chip dips rather than actual crushed avocados, which is really too bad because real guacamole makes a huge difference in flavour.  Their hot salsa is medium at best, not really all that spicy.  They have a little dessert tray that has cookies and churros, but I've never ordered from it-- everything in there looks like it has been there for weeks.  Their tired servers will then ask \"to stay or to go?\", and without looking at you, they'll type something into the register and then lean against the counter, looking away from you, as you pay for your meal.  Once you've paid, you'll be lucky if you get a \"thank you\" out of them-- but you're Canadian, and you'll say \"thank you\" to them regardless of their cold indifference towards your presence.  So, yeah, go here if you're desperate for a burrito, but don't expect a Chipotle-like experience-- you're in Canada, after all, and about as far away from real Mexican food as you can get.  But, I go back occasionally, so it can't be all that bad."}
{"text":"Picked up some chicken and shrimp burritos and a shrimp bowl for me. My bowl was good, shrimp was freshly made not already sitting there paid for extra shrimps, good qty. I would go again lots of toppings"}
{"text":"As far as fast food goes mucho burrito always serves a fresh and quality product. I typically stick to the pollo burrito. They put perfect proportions of meat to rice to veg in every burrito. The staff is friendly and helpful. I will return to this location time and time again."}
{"text":"I have tried many many burrito places but they were never as high standards as this location.  I love the food. Not to mention the enormous amount of portions here. The have chorizo meat which most other places do not have.  Everytime I go here I actually get extra put into my burrito/ quesadila because I am a regular customer here.  I don't go to any other location other than here.  For everyone who wants a good presentation of food. This is a fast food restaurant. Don't expect it to be le French cuisine.  Your going to eat it any way why does it matter how it is presented when you fully seen what was put inside and how it was made.  Have some compassion; those postpone work hard."}
{"text":"Four words and two contractions: Tex-mex rip-off.  I went for dinner there last night.  My fiance ordered a meat salad (hard taco shell) and I ordered a fish taco and a small chocolate milk.  Our bill came out to just over $20.  I realize most of the ingredients are fresh but come on... $20??  The food was OK for being a tex-mex place.  If they are trying to pass themselves off as authentic Mexican (I think they're smarter than that) then they have another thing coming.  Food OK.. Service, not so good.  The people working there were fine but look like they hated their jobs and the guy that served us kept mumbling.  With the noisy music playing we had to continually ask him to repeat himself.  When he did he made it sound like a burden that he had to repeat himself.  I'll probably only go back if I have a coupon and I'm really desperate for some faux Mexican food."}
{"text":"Mucho Burrito is like the Starbucks of fastfood.  I walked in there and I had NO IDEA how to place my order.    I stared at the menu for about 5 minutes before the girl behind the counter advised me to \"look at the photos on the wall\" to help me order.  So just like at Starbucks, I eventually went with the  most basic thing anyone can chooser.  At starbucks I usually get a \"medium coffee please\", and at Mucho Burrito I got a \"burrito\".    Plain and simple.    But I really enjoyed it!  It's not that I haven't had these types of massive burritos before, like Burrito Boyz in Toronto.  But I gotta say, I really enjoyed this.   The server was hard to understand however, as she spoke mumbled, quick, accented english.  And the price wasn't fantastic, I think its' aboue $11 for a Mucho Burrito, and $8 for a regular burrito.    Oh, and if you eat-in, they have a number of hot sauces etc to put on your burrito, available for self serve.   I give it a 3/5 but if Yelp offered half-stars I would give it a 3.5.  I will definitely go back, I am craving it already!"}
{"text":"I honestly don't know why I tried this place again..... The first time the food was awful with stale bits, but that was a while ago. I went to the Urban Eatery Mucho Burrito to get something to eat before I headed home from work for the day, and, while the food was decent (though their peppers could be cut smaller...) the service was HORRIBLE. This was such an awkward, slow and frustrating encounter. Honestly a smile can go a long way. The girl spoke so quietly I had to ask her to repeat herself every time. She just slapped food around and then put it on the tray. She then decided to talk to her coworker before deciding to help my husband, and he didn't get any better service.  I'm not sure if every Mucho Burrito is like this... But I don't think I will visit any of them again."}
{"text":"Always super slow service.  Have given this place a few chances but every time I am shocked at how slow they are at service and are not in any hurry at all even when the lineup starts to grow.  Plan to be here for 20-30 minutes just to get a takeout burrito."}
{"text":"Terrible, just terrible!  I was asked to wait 15 minutes for a dish( meaning i would miss my movie) NOT fast food in that sense at all! Next, my sister order a meal with a combo. The server repeated and confirmed the order. The bill came up to twice what it was supposed to! He blamed the customer for ordering incorrectly even though he repeated and confirmed the order. When i approached the server, he blamed the customer on ordering incorrectly even though he had repeated and confirmed the order. I informed him he would be losing 2 customers forever if he did not wish to fix the error.  He did not care. His macho attitude may have gained him an extra 17$ today, but he has lost at least 2 customers forever! Save your money and go to a real restaurant for the same money!"}
{"text":"Great burritos and customer service. Nice flavors and not super spicy, I appreciate that. The only thing that was a bit odd to me was that there were no chips with the burritos; I guess I am used to Moe's, where the burritos come with chips. Besides this, it was great :-)"}
{"text":"One word \"awful\". Went there hoping to get somewhat decent food since its fast food mexican. It was not eatable. We all had bowls two with shrimps. One with two types of meat. Shrimp was bland, tasteless. Gross. The meat was so so. The toppings were horrendous. Again bland, lacked seasoning, the bowl at the end looked like a bowl of garbage leftovers. Not appetizing. The employee, obviously  told, was adding as liitle as possible as he can the  toppings we would pick. Super cheap and stingy on the toppings. To the point the bowl that was \"supposed\" to be filled was half empty. I pointed it out to the cold unhappy cashier who seemed to be in charge she just brushed it off by saying thats the size of the classique. I felt like telling her keep your discusting cheap food. Never going again. I foresee this so called \"mexican\" food chain closing down very soon. We're in montreal with very good mexican restaurants maybe not fast food but why would you even bother spending money there not worth it. I wouldn't have even given it a 1 star. Thats how bad it was."}
{"text":"Mucho Burrito is real good, ONLY if you can handle it! The portions are huge, and their burritos are some of the tastiest you would find in the gta. A small hidden place in a plazza next to the main colossus plaza. More of a fast food setup, you get to pick and choose what you want, but one way or another, your burrito will turn out huge no matter how light you try to go! You can get a burrito with shredded beef or chicken, beef steak, shrimp, chorizo or pork! Rice, all sorta Mexican beans and veggies, and the toppings and sauces list is endless! Any of these bad boys will pack you a good 1400-1800 calories easy...but hey! Who's counting!? Their tacos and quesadillas are great as well...way to go Mucho"}
{"text":"Very good location of Mucho Burrito Extremely clean and kept well, It seems like a family run business, staff is very friendly, professional, and provide fast service. The food tasted great and fresh, Had the Veggie Supreme mix salad with Shrimp protein! I will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"Pretty hit-and-miss place, depending on who makes your food. Because of their inconstancy with portions, they get 2 stars. If you luck out with the right staff though, it is pretty damn tasty. Half the time though, I walk out feeling cheated and unsatisfied. A last resort stop now or only when craving as it is unfortunately still the only decent place to get a burrito in north Oakville. Shame."}
{"text":"I tried the ghost pepper burrito. The hotter than hell version.  So first off, the burrito itself is a solid 3 stars, edging towards 4. Why I'm giving these guys 5 stars though is because for the first time I've tried something at a fast food place that claims to be spicy, the food ACTUALLY WAS SPICY!   DQ's Flamethrower burger? More like BBQ lighter burger BK's Angry Whopper? More like mildly annoyed Whopper Mucho Burrito Hotter Than Hell Ghost Pepper Burrito - BAM! Hit the nail on the head.  It literally brought me to tears and I have a high tolerance for spicy food.  So in addition to the standard toppings they put bacon and a marmalade glaze on this bad boy. Seriously, what's not to like about this burrito? When I say they put bacon on it, they put bacon on it. It's probably like a half cup or so of chopped freshly cooked bacon.  Bonus: A free temporary tattoo for getting the ghost pepper burrito."}
{"text":"A Taco Bell turned Mucho. I find this hilarious.  The food was good as always, though the customer service could be better. The lady helping me had an accent which made her a little harder to understand but the issue was more that she was talking to the food when asking what I wanted on my burrito. Combine that with the glass wall and she was very difficult to hear. She also seemed a little scrambled and in a huge hurry to get our food made even though we were the only people in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Well Mucho, its a little disappointing that you tried to do a cookie cutter of Chipotle and failed, but good to see that you took your own spin on things in other areas.    This place give you three choices of burrito size; small, medium, and mucho.  I love that they ASK if you want your burrito grilled instead of making it an automatic thing like most places.  The prices are comparable to other burrito places, plan on spending $10-12 for a burrito and drink.  There are other items on the menu than burritos, but why bother, you went there for a burrito anyways.  Make sure you get a cinnamon tortilla for desert."}
{"text":"Came to try Mucho after receiving some coupons in the mail for meal deals. I usually don't frequent franchises, but I had a hankering for a burrito. Our temporary move to Pickering had me unfamiliar with the local food joints.   I showed the coupon to the person working the counter and he told me that the coupons were not able to be used yet. I asked him why not because there was no start date, only an expiration date on the coupon.  The manager told me that the coupons were not \"supposed\" to be mailed out yet and they weren't allowed to accept them. Seriously? I'm not going to argue over a few $, but it's the principle! I left and will never come back!!! Mucho you are not worth it."}
{"text":"Yahoo!  I went here on the weekend and it was a great experience!  We had the Barbacoa burritos smothered in sauce and they were delicious.  The portion was great and the lovely guy who served us, wrapped the burrito up with expertise!  I wasn't sure I was going to like it because I had the best burritos in Arizona and this place gives them a run for the money!  I have tried some \"authentic\" Mexican restaurants around Toronto and am usually quite disappointed.    The decor is basic but you can eat in or take out.  There was good traffic at this location and the selections were constantly refilled so nothing was sitting too long.    This was terrific and while it is \"fast food\", it was really good.  I will be back to try something else on the menu!"}
{"text":"Love Mexican Food but was so disappointed with portions, extra guacamole was literally 1/2 tsp and the bowl was half empty when served to me. Very unsatisfied and won't be back."}
{"text":"Mucho Burrito is a decent option if you want to have fast food and you want to eat healthy.  One can customize whatever go into their burrito and at least you can pack that with vegetables.  Medio Pan Seared Tilapia ($7.99) which I tried to load up with as many toppings and spiciness as I want was A-OK. 3 tiny piece of fish though quite pathetic. Good as a snack but for a meal? Maybe I should have just order one of the meat...  Good enough for an occasion mexician food fix up in Scarborough where Asian food rules, but I definitely have much better burrito somewhere else.  Afternoon Special $5 for 2 tacos and pop. That's sound like excellent snack food!  Do try the Death by Johnny Mega Hot Sauce! I might just come back just for that!"}
{"text":"Consistently delicious and extremely friendly staff! This location is wonderful every time. Delivery through skip the dishes is good too!"}
{"text":"So I'm Mexican and every time I go to a Mexican restaurant I get ready for the disappointment. Me and my mom went to this place since we were hungry and we couldn't find another restaurant we were looking for. I was impressed to find that overall the food was good and the service was great! The meat was well seasoned, the salsas were fresh and the portions were good. I had the veggie quesadilla and my mom the burrito classique viande. We finished it all. We identified the Mexican flavours from our kitchen. To me, is the best Mexican fast food that I've tried in Montreal. Since we liked the food we ordered churros which had an authentic Mexican flavour and crunchiness and even if the sauce wasn't cajeta, I liked the dulce de leche."}
{"text":"My first time at any Mucho Burrito, I ordered a vegetarian Taquiero (sp) salad bare bowl.  It was mucho lettuce and measly amounts of the rice, beans everything else.  Was ok, nothing to rave about and probably won't try again.  Plus I was the only one dining in and the music was so insanely loud I had to ask if they could turn it down, was off putting but I was too hungry to wait to eat!"}
{"text":"Just like reality TV and double stuffed golden Oreos, fast food burrito restaurants are one of my biggest guilty pleasures.  Mucho Burrito is one of my favourite lunch time spots that's fairly inexpensive and leaves you feeling full! They offer a small, regular and mucho size which you can select depending on your hunger.  My latest visit I noticed they had a new burrito named the \"Smokin' Barbacoa\". I usually order beef barbacoa so I figured it wouldn't be a huge difference. When I got to the toppings the lady informed me the burrito came with coleslaw and BBQ sauce.. I couldn't imagine the flavours fitting well, coleslaw on a burrito?? She sensed my hesitation and ensured me it was delicious and man.. She was right. This was hands down the best burrito I've ever had.   I have no complaints about this location of Mucho Burrito. I've been to other franchises that were stingy on toppings but that has never been a problem here. The toppings also look fresh and there are a vast amount to choose from. There's always a lunch line but service is fast and friendly.   Side note: I always add guacamole to my burrito.. But come on, $1 for a small spoonful? Also you can upgrade to a combo for an extra $2.50 this includes a canned pop your choice of salsa and tortilla chips."}
{"text":"Why not have a Corona with your Burrito?  I came here with my boyfriend, I wasn't hungry but watched him eat. He loves it here! I've been to the location at Yonge and Eglington and its a hole other experience at this store.  -Very big/lots of seating -Friendly Latino staff -Big portions -Delicious food -Have their Liquor licence -Great location -Cool decor."}
{"text":"This was the first time I tried Mucho Burrito, and I can probably say I will not be coming back.  Great location! I know a lot of people come around the area for lunch. Service was alright.   I ordered the Classic Quesadilla. There was NO taste and most of the Quesadilla was empty, barely any cheese or veggies. The sour cream was a disappointment, basically just bland liquid. However, the pico de gallo was good.   Tip: Get your Quesadillas elsewhere!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty bad. The only good thing about it is the portion sizes.. that's it. The small sized burrito is pretty big even.  Okay now onto the bad. First off, they put way too much sauce into the burritos and their tortilla is way too thin or something because the moment I opened my burrito wrapping, there was already a gigantic hole in the burrito tortilla and everything was leaking out. I ended up eating the burrito with a spoon. That's how bad it was. Also, it doesn't even taste that good! Avoid the Jarrito drinks as well. More pricey than regular fountain drinks and tastes like a bad version of Crush too."}
{"text":"Absolutely rude service especially from that pale white girl Christina she is just rude when she speaks to you as if she wants you to hurry up and order. The beer and wine choices are pretty good but overall the staff here are rude the one asian girl who always looks like she's confused she tends to slur her words maybe they drink or get \"you know what\" at work burritos here are tasteless it's like eating cardboard"}
{"text":"Absolutely rude employees,disgusting food I found a raw piece of chicken in my over priced burrito,also the owners are rude and are cheap a holes fk this place do not eat here"}
{"text":"the worst customer service and burritos ever! I ordered a mucho burrito as I'm eating it half way I notice a piece of metal the one you would find on a metal scrub I go to the cashier and asked to talk to the manager his name is MOHAMMED I tell him what happened he is extremely rude asks me if I have a receipt and I said no he then tells me we can make a new burrito for you and that's it?! I said no I would like a refund he then gives a story about how his business isn't making money etc etc I can tell since there are cock roaches nd the portion ing is horrible now thay this guy took over fk mucho"}
{"text":"Uhm okay.. this place changed a lot since I've last been here. During my last visit, I ordered the steak burrito bowl, and I noticed that he put such a small amount of meat in there (before it was a decent portion, now it's just a few pieces) Yet compared to everything else, he decided to put a lot of shredded cheese in it. I also decided to get churros, oh man was that a mistake.. it was stale and was probably one of the worst churros I have ever tried. Never again."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Mucho Burrito since it opened and it has yet to disappoint either myself or those I've referred there. It has become \"comfort food\" and at least once every 2 weeks the cravings begin for one of their burritos.  When you enter the restaurant you'll most likely be at the end of a line of people waiting to place their orders. As you approach the counter (if you're a newbie) you'll be able to peruse the menu board...however the staff are friendly and will walk you through/answer any questions you may have. They're great.  Prices are in line with the amount of food you get....mine is usually the medium burrito..and it is always enough to fill me. I've had the smothered burrito as well....eh...personal choice. It was good...but I prefer just a good old regular burrito to do the trick. I've also had the quesedios (sp) and they are good as well....but when I visit, it's for a burrito !  When you're finally at the counter you order the size of burrito you want, white or whole wheat tortilla and then the adventure begins. After slightly toasting the tortilla, they'll ask if you want: rice, veggies and beans...then you move down to your meat (sorry to all the vegans out there but I HAVE to have meat in my burrito): beef, fish, sausage, chicken or pork...(I usually get the pork or chicken but have tried them all but the fish)..then on to the condiments...cheeses, cilantro, etc. Be forwarned...when they say hot salsa...it's not the bland hot salsa that Taco Bell uses (which a 2 year old can eat)...it's HOT salsa....and their jalapeno's are HOT ! YUM !  You then get asked if you want Guacamole...it's only $.99 and those I know who've had it it say it's worth it (I'm not a fan of guacamole so I can't say how it is). They then add sour cream (if you want) and burrito sauce (if you want)...then it's rolled and pressed in a panini press.   You can get a combo that has either a cookie or nacho chips......I personally didn't think either were that great...so my order is done save for a drink.  Seat yourself and enjoy...and don't forget to take your garbage to the waste bins as you head out. C'mon people..if you were at home you'd clear your table...do the same here.  WOW...writing this has made me hungry....think I'll go there tonight. It is ALWAYS a good meal."}
{"text":"A Mucho Burrito within walking distance of my house......oh no!   Dropped in just after they opened so they've got a bit of growing pains to eek out.  Staff were friendly, albeit a tad lost the night of our visit. You could tell they were nervous and kept questioning the manager about what went in what, etc. ...in time they'll be seasoned pros.   The decor is fantastic.....one of the nicest I've seen in a fast food burrito place....barn wood on the wall and live slab seating...very rustic but very Canadiana.  The main issue with this location is that it's not laid out well. At the MB near Collosus...you come in and place your order...then follow your burrito down the line as its stuffed with your selections.....then you hit the cashier, get your drink, pay and then seat yourself. At this location, as soon as you walk in you hit the cashier...which means you have to walk around other customers to start the order process. The night we visited, there was a family of 5 ordering so we had to go through the restaurant seating area (to get around them) so we could place our order. Weird layout and I wouldn't like people standing in line (to order) next to where I was seated. Food is the same......great burritos, great tacos, just a very weird layout"}
{"text":"If you're looking for flavor city like Burrito Boyz, then this is not the place. However it doesn't mean this place isn't good, its just different.   I like going here when I'm looking for something a bit healthier to eat. I tried the salad and the whole wheat chicken burrito. Both were decent, but lack a bit of that Mexican \"kick\". Price is good and seems like its the only burrito place in the area, so it wins by default lol"}
{"text":"I'm just craving a quesadilla right about now.  Or maybe a taco salad bowl.  Perhaps I'm salivating for a big honking taco.  Whatever the craving is, it's for Mucho Burrito.  This place has some pretty decent food, and for a pretty good price too.  The food is fast, seems fresh, and tastes wonderful.  Every once in a while a good burrito really hits the spot, and Mucho Burrito is definitely one of the best fast food Mexican places I've seen.  And, if you're looking for someone to spice up your party, they even do catering.  That's right, you can have Mucho Burrito cater an event you are planning which means everyone gets to enjoy the good taste of old Mexico.  Or is that the old taste of good Mexico?  I don't know, but you understand.  Each of their food options come in different sizes, so you don't have to buy what you don't want.  The food always looks delicious and certainly meets standards.  I'm going for a burrrrrrrito today!"}
{"text":"Good burrito chain. Best burrito value in the area, without question.  Everything seemed fresh as they have a steady flow of customers. It can be a bit messy when you get into the larger sizes or burritos, and the guac is overpriced as it is in all restaurants that make you pay for it.   I have had many items on the menu and can say everything I had was pretty good, but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"They wanted an extra $1 to add beans to tacos. The chicken was questionable. The salsa is bland. There are many of these types of burrito joints around the PATH - avoid this one!"}
{"text":"I believe I'm the biggest Mucho Burrito fan out there and I live in San Francisco where a world-class burrito is a commodity. I've gotta say that this is the only place in Toronto that measures up (I lived in Toronto for 5 years).   I almost exclusively order the medium chicken burrito. The medium will satisfy you, the grande size is extremely large and most likely you won't be able to finish it.   They'll walk you through each step in the burrito building process, so I'm going to let you in on my secret. Make sure you ask for extra grilled veggies at the early stages, as you get to the end of the line make sure to ask for extra extra burrito sauce (that's right, you have to say extra twice!). I have no idea what the sauce is, but it's damn good and there's no time to question.   If you follow my two tips, I guarantee this will be the best burrito you've tried in Toronto, hands down."}
{"text":"Went there around 630pm. Was greeted by two friendly employees. Had a burrito with spicy sausage , a side of nachos and churros.  They had various meats available had choice of any they were all available for the time I went I thought they would had sparse meats but it was all available.  Everything was great for a fast food Mexican eats (100 X better than taco bell) the toppings and salsa tasted fresh and the spicy sauce I had was freshly made so it was also great. Nachos were warm and the spicy salsa was good. They even heated the churros for me which made it taste even better with the caramel dip. Very filling and I just had a small burrito now I gotta work out LOL."}
{"text":"A bit skimpy on the toppings the shell was a neat idea but seemed like not enough filling to be full left the place feeling hungry after the Sala bowl and it cost more than I expected."}
{"text":"Came in for dinner on my way home with my wife. They had run out of some ingredients but were awesome about it and offered a snack while we waited. Super-friendly staff and the owner was really engaging. Thank you for the treats!   The burritos are always amazing at this location and the people are always very friendly."}
{"text":"I asked for a shrimp burrito, which I previously had at the Pickering location - I particularly liked that it was pan fried so I head into this location expecting the same item.   On the menu on the wall, it says the shrimp are pan fried - great! Then I notice them putting the shrimp in the oven instead. When I ask about it, they tell me I had to ASK if I wanted them pan fried!   Seriously? Why should I have to ask if the sign SAYS it is pan fried?   No offer to give me what I was supposed to get in the first place. Just a comment that they have been doing it in the oven for the past year and a half, and you have to ask if you want it done in a pan.  Very poor customer service."}
{"text":"When reviewing this place one has to consider its competitors out there. All the burritos places are relatively the same price wise so its really not that expensive, and guac is usually  extra. In the few burrito bars where it isn't.. Well the guac is not that great.   Now with all this in mind, I must say I like this place a lot. I have eaten in just about every burrito bar out there. It has good flavor and taste for a chain restaurant. I come here when I am in the area and looking for some Mexican food. Now of course you can get a better burrito at some good Mexican restaurants. But thats like comparing a Macdonald's burger to a restaurant burger. So compared to stores similar it is pretty darn good."}
{"text":"OMG...the most delish burritos in Leaside.  The quality and portions are good for the price and you are able to custom build the burrito to suit your taste.  Everything is freash and the service is quick.  The beer and desert selection is not great so I wouldn't recommend either."}
{"text":"Love that Mucho Burrito has opened in Crowfoot!  I love their slowly marinated beef burrito!  Everything is so tasty and good here especially for people who want to watch what they eat - wholewheat tortilla, different types of heatness of salsa, different condiments to put in their burrito.    I always walk away with a Beef burrito with wholewheat tortilla, no rice, gauacamole, burrito suace and the hottest salsa they have plus jalapenos and cilantro!  It's never too spicy for me!  Guac is 50cents more."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time today, and I was pretty happy.  I came here with one other person, and we shared three soft tacos and an order of nachos. The chicken taco and the steak taco were both extremely good. You have your choice of toppings, and there are a variety of hot sauces to choose from. The nachos were nothing to write home about, though. They were covered in that fake orange cheese stuff, and despite all the toppings, a lot of the chips were left naked. What I was most impressed with out of everything was the selection of drinks. All of the basic varieties of pop are here, plus Dr. Pepper and all three flavours of Crush, among others that I didn't even recognize.  The service was friendly, though hard to hear over the blaring Latin music. Sadly, I guess they've brought it back since B G. posted their review."}
{"text":"Th worst thing you can do in customer service when in the food industry is to not refund the purchase when there is a problem. I was there 2 days ago and asked for no peppers or onions. I got peppers and onions. No problem. Mistakes happen. I called and had to leave a message. No return call the next day. I went in and explained it all. NO REFUND. I'm disappointed that Victor is willing to lose a customer over $8.00. Hopefully your day gets better and you are not as rude to the next customer."}
{"text":"They have a great burrito, except that during lunch times, the employees don't give a shit about you. They just want to get your order out of the way as fast as possible; whether you get what you want or not is not their concern.  The lady didn't even ask me what toppings I wanted and just went through with the burrito. It was still good, but I would've liked to have guac  Regardless, 3 stars cuz the burrito is delicious, and filling.   Food -4 Service -2 Venue -3 Vibe -3"}
{"text":"I really like this place! Sometimes it's kind of hard to eat out and stay to healthy choices and what I like about this place, you can enjoy a quick and still nice meal without being worried you cheated on your diet. You can even check the menu on line and even check nutrition facts of everything!"}
{"text":"Great fresh Mexican food. Build your burrito how you like it with choice of meats, veg, salsa and various hot sauces. Beware the ghost pepper hot sauce though, my eyes are sweating now after eating it!"}
{"text":"I'm still pretty pissed off as I write this updated review.  We often come to this location as it's my sons favorite place to eat.  Unbeknownst to me today was cinco de mayo and the burritos were $5, we usually get medium burritos so the savings of $3 hardly warranted the line up out the door.  So I proceeded to the drive through as it didn't appear too long.  WRONG  The wait to go through the drive through was longer than waiting inside, in line- I know this because I saw an acquaintance walk in, right as I drove into the drive through.  I saw she was already done eating and walking out of the restaurant as I was paying for my drive through order that took 1h! The worst part is you don't know how far in the cars are lined up till you turn the corner past the garbage bin! At that point, you can't back out! You're stuck!  So me and my son wait, and wait and wait some more while each car transaction takes about 10 minutes- this is totally unacceptable! And that wasn't even the worst part, by the time we got to the window they were out of several items- the things my son likes on his burrito are, chicken, pico de Gallo, corn salsa, cheese and light rice, light veg, light beans and a bit of cilantro. Well to start off they had no pico, no corn salsa and what I assume out of chicken and cheese as my son said there were like 3 chunks in the first few bites and no cheese was present either.  I ordered the Barbacoa shredded beef and found they were really sparse with it as well, but no sour cream in mine, my son revealed his did have sour cream and he does not like any dairy except for cheese which didn't appear on either burrito, there were however, copious amounts of rice and green bell peppers on both.  My son couldn't get through his burrito so he took mine and said that it tasted worse than his.  I would have rather paid full price than get 2 sub par burritos, really that $6 savings wouldn't break the bank and in all honesty, we both tossed them out about a 1/4 way through and were left bummed because we do prefer mucho to all the other garbage around.  The older gentleman that's usually there during the day is the owners father and is such a sweet guy, I wish I would have just went in and monitored the process because I felt the drive though experience was kind of a rip off and not what mucho burrito is all about.  If they had a sign out at the drive through entrance saying they were out of two of the most popular toppings I would have never drove through and made the purchase.  I would have just come back the following day and paid full price for full toppings as we usually do.    This experience totally turned me off mucho and I probably won't be back for a while. Cinco de Mayo $5 burritos sounds like a great concept but upon further inspecting the chicken burrito at home and no chicken was to be seen after the first 3-4 bites, I felt corners were cut creating sub par food to offset the price. That, an hour long drive through wait with sour cream on the wrong burrito and running out of fundamental toppings receives a 1 star from me.  Adios amigo :("}
{"text":"I honestly can't say that I'm a burrito connoisseur, but these tasted fine to me. I've had a lot of Chipotle in my life, and these are at least equivalent in quality, though they're pricier.  They have three sizes - the 'medium' was more than enough for me. I wanted to try the tilapia, but it requires a 5-10 minute wait, which is a dealbreaker during a lunch hour. Not too hard to find seats; despite the crazily long lines, few people eat in.  If it's possible, come after 12:30, and the place will be completely empty - you won't have to wait as long in line, and your burrito will be put together with a bit more attention."}
{"text":"Been there 3 times.  I had their fish burrito. It was ok at best. The Burrito shell was lacking something and the overall combination of flavours seemed bland. Not as fresh and as good as the Haddock Burrito from Burrito Boys.  I had their chicken and beef Burritos. They tasted better but the process of making them seems rushed. They are lacking that fusion like Burrito Boys."}
{"text":"Very poor consistency in portions. This chain needs to implement some portion control.They do attempt to remember your order which is quite nice."}
{"text":"came for lunch, left very satisfied.  i went in because i got an email about the special \"poblano popper\" burrito.  went in and placed an order, i was a touch annoyed with the fact that the guy who was heating up the wrap told me \"sir this is a set item, you cannot add or take away any items when you order this\" ok...thats fine by me, but there is a nicer way to speak to people IMHO.   being a guy who loves everything hot, and new flavors to come with it, this \"special\" burrito is amazing. gentle heat with lots of flavor  highly recommended"}
{"text":"I love the new salsas that Mucho Burrito offers.    I am always impressed with the good quality meat and toppings.  The staff at the 130th location are very friendly and efficient as well.   A great fast food staple that satisfies and tastes homemade."}
{"text":"If you want authentic, go to many of the actual Mexican restaurants in Calgary.  This IS a fast food place, and knowing that keeps expectations low, which meant for me I was pleasantly surprised by the fresh ingredients and delicious taste.  I tend to order the grilled chicken burrito.  It is so filling with the rice and beans, so I usually ask them to put less rice and beans and more guacamole, salsa, lettuce, etc.  Lots of choices for salsa and sauces, its a delicious fast food stop."}
{"text":"Fresh, delicious, clean; friendly staff.  Great options for very tasty \"mexican\" dishes, you won't get bored eating here. Best fast food in Vaudreuil! Lots of parking, easy to get to, and other unique and interesting shops nearby."}
{"text":"I had the pulled pork Burritto, and the pork was plenty but lacked flavour. It had no taste; just a burrito filled with mild beans, rice was warm, lettuce, beans, etc I wouldn't return again as I believe the food is not really hot but kept at minimal temp. There is only one gentleman working behind the counter, and a another couple sitting down and eating. Besides me and the couple, the place was empty.  The Burrito competition is fierce, and I have had many, this one needs serious improvement."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite fast food places.  The portion that you get for he money is hands down one of the best values you will find.  They don't call it Mucho for nothing.  One burrito will normally make two meals for me it is that huge."}
