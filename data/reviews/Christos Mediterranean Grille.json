{"text":"Magic happens at this restaurant. Beautiful family, beautiful service, wonderful food (and wine).  We love you Monica!!!! Love always, your friends in CA"}
{"text":"Just a charming low key Greek restaurant.  Cristos, the owner and waiter, greets every customer as a long lost friend.    We started with the home made hummus with warm pita bread.  The salads with iceberg lettuce are saved by the homemade dressing.  We had the Penne Apollo and Exohiko.  The penne had lamb and beef over pasta with a tomato sauce, a Greek slant on pastas.  Exohiko is a Shepard pie in phyllo dough with a light sauce over it.  Very tasty. I almost forgot the homemade red wine which compliments the lamb especially well.  You can't visit without having the Jackie O dessert.  Cristos originally made it for, yes, Jackie O when he was a chef on the yacht.  The best tasting low calorie dessert I ever had."}
{"text":"I usually bring friends here when we're going to see/have just seen one of the shows in the Cultural District; I tend to park in the nearby garage across from the Byham Theater and so we've always got an excuse to stop on our way.  The food has always been good (not spectacular, but good) and the prices have always been more than reasonable.    To be honest, the food doesn't look like much when it's served; sometimes my moussaka looks too watery and there was one time my friend's dinner just looked like a mess.  However, the food always tastes good and is very well-seasoned even if it doesn't look like a masterpiece.  I have found that the food can vary from time to time; it's never bad, but sometimes I think that it is more tasty than at others.  As far as the service is concerned, I have been here when I've been one of 3 couples in the whole restaurant as well as when the entire place has been swamped with patrons and the service varies accordingly.  Sometimes my servers have been almost too attentive.  The last time, however, they seemed to be short-staffed and my date and I were forgotten in the mix for about 20 minutes.  It really depends upon how many folks are there at a given time, but the servers have always been unfailingly polite.    It has a very interesting decor inside (lots of Greek paraphernalia) and features pictures of Christo's family; it really reminds you that this is a family business.  I've also sat outside which was really nice on a summer night even if there weren't breathtaking views.   I wouldn't bother with the gyros here since they don't seem to be their forte.  Stick with the other traditional Greek recipes and you should be pleased especially when you consider the prices.   The Greek coffee is good (and served with great presentation), but it is very small (think an espresso shot) and rather expensive for the volume served; I think I'll go for regular coffee the next time.  Also, Christo's has house wines that are worth trying; I am a fan of the white one.  The Jackie O cake is the dessert that everyone orders and with good reason; it is a unique sort of cake.  It is chilled and very, very moist with a sort of whipped topping which makes it a very light dessert.  I find that most desserts are too heavy or sweet and so this cake is one of my favorite desserts.  And at $3/slice, it is a steal compared to the desserts offered at other restaurants downtown.  Apparently, they sometimes have a chocolate version of the Jackie O; they had it on New Years Eve but I didn't try it then and wish I had."}
{"text":"By far, my favorite place to eat either before or after a show downtown (factoring in both price and food).   The food is great and the atmosphere is very relaxed. Like the Moussaka and the Greek salad with gyro meat (or grilled lamb, but you have to ask special since it is not on menu). The homemade wine is great, as is the Jackie O. desert."}
{"text":"We love eating at Christos and have many times in the past............however, I can't help feeling taken advantage of this summer on more than one occasion.  We love the simpleness of the place -- in fact it reminds me of Nana's kitchen growing up - NO frills - lots of love and yummy things to eat.  There is a particular st lye that I do not enjoy and that is the constant offers of this and that and they make it look like hummus and pita are complimentary as well as salads being included.  By the time one receives the bill -- EEKE! I could have eaten at a more upscale place.  That's all I have to say -- don't enjoy feeling hustled -- not sure if we will continue to dine there when there is a place right across the street with less charm but yummy food."}
{"text":"Thinking that Six Penn would be open on a Sunday after 4p and not having anywhere else to go we stepped into Christos, finding the place empty should have been our first clue.    The hummas was watery and bland,  and the pita bread was dried out, the homemade wine (we had red and white) very good, the greek side salad also very good.  My spanakapita was definitely heated up in a microwave and tasted old as well as the mousaka (yuck)!  The place clearly needs a good cleaning and the bathroom....well, when my son came up he said \"it puts the lotion into the basket\" a line from Silence of the Lambs.  The waiter tried to get us to order way more than we wanted....strange, uncomfortable place.   I won't go back."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food (Especially  the salad and homemade wine) atmosphere and service. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I hated it!  First, when I reach there the server showed me a table at the door. I asked for another location because it was cold... His answer.... Why? followed with an arrogant face!!!  OK!!!! We finally sited in another place.... The salad came... It was ok... Nothing special... The entree... Please.... I can cook better... The lamb was sooo ordinary...   Since I was in Pittsburgh for a meeting, I ask to the same old \"gentleman\" that was serving us for a itemized ticket ( to be reimbursed by university). Whole sh....!!!!  His answer: this is the receipt, I can give you nothing else! You can write by yourself what you ate and show to them.... The only restaurant that gave me so rude, unprofessional answer ever!!!!  It is not everything... I just took my things and I was moving out when the same \"gentleman\" say loud: THE TIP WAS NOT INCLUDE!!!! Oh my god.... Should I really tell him how much he deserved? But, I took a deep breath and some bucks from my pocket, and give to him... Saying sorry with my mouth, but shov.... it!!!! With my eyes!!!!   Please, if you go to there... Cross the street, you find a nice Indian cuisine. Five steps ahead, Cambodian. Three steps back, a nice cafe. Better, Six Penn at the corner..."}
{"text":"The food was clearly microwaved (ie the ring around the soup bowl and splatters along the sides). The fish was rubbery. The wait staff, although nice, was very salesy always trying to \"add on\" something in a pushy way.   I asked for my check and barely ate anything. I think the waiter got his ego bruised because he decided to display his \"Best In City\" award right behind my head as I was still sitting at the table... a shame the award was from 2005! I guess a lot changed in 7 years?  Don't bother with this place!"}
{"text":"Stopped here because Greek sounded interesting and there was a guy standing out front that was very friendly and couldn't say enough good things about the food. In hindsight I wish I'd just pushed him out of the way. I also wish I'd read the reviews here and gone across the street to get a Greek fix.  Tried the red wine. That was pretty yummy!   The hummus was watery and not great. The salads that came with our dinners were listed as Greek side salads. The lettuce was all iceberg and very little of it was green. Some of it was brown though... There was one sad little kalamata olive that was not of great quality. Why be stingy with cheap olives? Tomatoes were squishy and tasteless. To top it all off, the greek dressing was little more than oil and vinegar.   I ordered baked eggplant covered in tomato sauce served over rice pilaf and a side of veggies. Soft and boring. The rice pilaf was just oily, bland rice. No spice, no nothin'. Blah. My dinner guest ordered the Mediterranean Fish. She declared the fish cooked well-enough, but said the dish was similarly boring.  Paying the bill was a pain in the butt. We sat outside to eat and, in a timely manner, were brought a check with no numbers, not even a total. We had to walk into the restaurant and to the back to the register to pay. There we were greeted by our server and another server and stood there chatting with them while we waited for someone else to come out of the kitchen to operate the register. We got the certified register operator after a few minutes and when we handed over credit cards we were told that we needed to tell them how much we wanted to tip up front because they had to run the cards for the exact amount. I had cash to tip, but still, with our server standing right there, very uncomfortable. Great service, boring food, crappy ambiance. Never going back."}
{"text":"Went for lunch, the hummus was good, i had the eggplant which was awfully bland even with a nice tomato sauce.  no beer with lunch though (bogus!)"}
{"text":"This place was really busy when we arrived so it seemed promising. Some of the food was good and others were sub-par.  Two of us ate the gyro platter which comes with:  hummus (watery)  pita (store bought)  gyro meat (I've never had gyro meat like this before, it was ultra thin and had a rubbery texture - also the portion was so small)  Greek salad (iceberg with sparse toppings and too much dressing)  grape leaves (vegetarian but quite good)  and rice (actually this was the tastiest thing on the platter - it had a nice lemon and chicken broth flavor).   Overall the food was hit or miss. The most disappointing were the pita and the gyro meat. My companion had the salmon and said it was unremarkable. I think diners come for the cake which was eaten by almost every person in the joint.   I also have to agree with some of the other reviewers, this place is disgustingly dirty. All patrons walk through the kitchen to use the bathroom which was really gross. The kitchen was not clean and our waiter had food on his hands when he served us.   Even homemade wine and honey soaked cake won't bring me back again."}
{"text":"I spent over $50 on two males with two sides and two sodas the portion that they serve with my delivery was very very minimal the drinks that I was charged two dollars for water fountain drinks that were 90% nice and the 10% of soda that was supposed to be my drink had fallen spilled out in the bag that they wrapped The drinks and the quality of food didn't taste good the rice had to had been packaged rice not traditional homemade Mediterranean rice I ordered the lamb shanks that were too thin slices of lamb very very minimal serving and quality and taste the food was not good I do not recommend ordering from here at all one so ever so don't even bother"}
{"text":"I really might go up to 4 stars.  I've been coming here for probably more than 15 years, even when it was called Susies.  Christo was the chef even then. don't come here if you mainly frequent chain or upscale restaurants, but do come if you like tradtional Greek food. Some complain about slow service but I think it's just cultural--we tend to be too much in a hurry.  But if you're heading to an event, give yourself two hours.  The food is good, best avogolemono (lemon chicken) soup ever!"}
{"text":"Used to be a good place, now it sucks big time.  Watery and rotting salad, the lamb shank was rubbery and covered in nasty tasteless gravy. We can't even describe how awful the broccoli was. I don't know how you could screw up just warming up some broccoli, but they managed to do it.   We have gone to Christos in the past, but this was the first time in a few years. It used to be affordable and tasty.Now, you couldn't pay me to go back."}
{"text":"Our FAVORITE RESTAURANT in Pittsburgh - we come here every time we are in town. Best hummus in the tri-state area!  The lamb is GREAT! Actually, I haven't had anything here that wasn't great! Christos remembers us everytime we walk in the door.  We have our own special table right by the kitchen and talk with him while we eat. The baclava and the Jackie O cake are to die for.  Don't pass up the grape leaves and the homemade wine. We always buy extra food to take home."}
{"text":"Ordered take out from Christos.  I ordered a diet coke and it was in a cup.  THANK GOODNESS I took the lid off first.  There were HUNDREDS of large white particles in the diet coke that looked like paint chips,  eggshells or paper and did not dissolve in the liquid but remained floating around.  This is a health hazard and needless to say, I will not be ordering from this establishment again.  As for the food, mediocre at best  The baklava was average, the mixed grille kabab (chicken and lamb) was okay, dry and chewy at times but overall edible.  The salad that came with the mixed grille was decent in flavor but did have some brown old lettuce in it.  As for the cold combination, the tzatziki, one grape leaf, and hummus were fine but the tarmasalata had some ingredient which was clearly spoiled.  The crème caramel (greek version of flan) was floating in water, really strange texture; my guess is it was frozen then defrosted, but a dessert should absolutely not be floating in a large pool of water."}
{"text":"The decor may be a little shabby but the food was excellent. We hesitated based upon some the reviews, but gave it a try and was very pleasantly surprised---the food fresh and good. The eggplant delicious and the price very reasonable---will go back!"}
{"text":"I had a very different experience than many of the other reviewers. I just had dinner on a Sunday here with a dear friend and her family, and I loved it.   We had a plateful of appetizers to share, and I really enjoyed the baba ganoush, the tatziki, and the stuffed grape leaves. The hummus was fine, but the other stuff was better. The red table wine we were served was also excellent. The white was good, too, but a little sweeter than I tend to like my grapes. The red was much drier, which was why I liked it better.  The lemon chicken orzo soup was delicious; creamy, comforting, and full of flavor from the lemon.  For my main course I had grilled lamb kebab with tiropita, a flaky pocket of phyllo dough stuffed with cheese and happiness. The veggies and rice that came with my meal were also tasty.  We tried the baklava, Jackie O cake, and coffee for dessert. We ended up sharing everything, and I could have joyfully eaten an entire slice of the Jackie O cake by myself. It was dense and moist from the lemon-honey syrup drizzled on top, and the cinnamon was a nice touch. The coffee was special, too; almost creamy without added milk, and strong, but not bitter.   Also, our waitress was delightful--more than willing to explain menu items, give recommendations, and paced the meal for us delightfully. When we were finished with everything, she said we could just hang out and relax: there was no hint of trying to get us to leave. She was genuine and friendly, and absolutely added to the entire experience."}
{"text":"MMMM, super yummy. The Spanakopita is awesome!  And with my dessert I got the Onassis coffee which was soooooooo good. I will return just for that!   It's one of those small places that must get popular by word of mouth because I had never heard of it. Really wasn't expecting it to be as good as it was. It's small and crowded, can be sort of uncomfortable as you sit so close to other diners, so expect that - it's probably a cultural difference, but expect great food."}
{"text":"I just had an impromptu lunch with my wife and son and we had a lovely lunch. The owner was charming and helpful. The hummus we were served when we sat down was delicious. I had sliced lamb with rice and a salad. Yummy. Human sized portions, not gigantic gut-busting portions. My son had a delicious pasta dish with ground lamb and beef. This place has been here for over 35 years. I loved looking at the old family photos. Overall, a very nice comfortable experience. If you're a pretentious jerk from San Francisco(ahem-spinach lady), then go look for a gastropub. If you want a meal like you'd get at your Greek grandmothers house, then this is the place for you. Very reasonably priced as well."}
{"text":"I come here every time I'm in Pittsburgh and always have a great time so I'm kind of confused as to why others say otherwise. The ambience is really nice-- it has an intimate, yet warm, homey feel to it, which is good if you want to go for a date or with your family. It is decorated with authentic old Greek photos which always make me feel at home (although I'm from Sicily!) The food is great every time I go there and SOO filling --I feel like I'm at home and my grandmother is stuffing me with food! I don't have to even mention the Jackie O as everyone is probably aware by now of how scrumdiddlyumptious it is! Will be in Pittsburgh soon so you'll know where to find me -- Christos!"}
{"text":"Christo cooked on Jackie O's yacht and gave our table of six such personal attention. Extraordinary experience that you rarely find anymore. While his 101 year old father makes the wine, his son-in-law Dmitri is in the kitchen keeping the Greek family's culinary traditions alive and well. Don't refuse the cake...seriously...so good!"}
{"text":"This place looked hopeful for authentic Mediterranean but the food just didn't live up to any expecation. Do yourself a favor and go next door to Cafe Milano."}
{"text":"My husband & I had dinner here tonight. Nothing less than perfect. The service was great & the food was amazing. We can wait to go back & take the kids."}
{"text":"I have been to Christos twice. Both times have been very enjoyable. The food is authentic. Lamb combo platter is delicious. The wait staff was very helpful with choices. Homemade wine. All these things made me wish I was back in Greece. The atmosphere reminded me of the Tavernas in Greece.  Again the Lamb had a delicious flavor! Don't expect  intimate or romantic.  There is nice Greek music playing and Good food - what more do you need?"}
{"text":"Food lacked flavor for every course. Service was very bad even though only 2 tables were being served at the time. The leg of lamb was flavorless strips of low grade meat, maybe lamb. Waiter will try and hard sell at every interaction throughout the meal."}
{"text":"As I was passing by this place the owner (I think it was the owner) got my attention and persuaded me to look at the menu. Seeing that he was anxious for business I obliged and took a seat outside. I had the Taramasalata, which I believe was the mashed caviar, which was pretty good but didn't seem much different from Hummus. For my entree I ordered the Roasted Leg of Lamb, which came with a salad, rice pilaf and veggies. The lamb was okay nothing great and the rice I felt was a tad mushy and seemed like either too much water was added or it didn't all evaporate or absorb. The  salad, which I had with anchovies was very good as were the mixed veggies, which seemed to have an authentic flare to it. I also ordered dessert, which was a slice of cake with whipped cream and drizzlings of cinnamon, which was good but nothing special. The service was good as the owner was attentive to my needs. While I ate outside, I did go inside to pay and noted the Greek decor which was appealing.  All in all, I can tell the owner cares and made a reasonable effort to accommodate me. That said I think this is a nice establishment in an excellent location, but the food needs a step up. It wasn't bad, but there is room for improvement. Here is what I recommend: rice needs to be better prepared and perhaps have some nuts, raisins or garnish added to it, the lamb could be thicker, have the fat and/or tough parts removed and also have a stronger marinade or come with a gravy or sauce for more flavor, and maybe the mashed caviar could be mixed in with some unmashed caviar, which would give it much more flare and appeal."}
{"text":"Just ate in this wonderful Greek restaurant.   The lemon chicken soup, hummus, Greek salad & spanakopita were delish.  Glad I saved room for the galactoboureko dessert.    For being located downtown, the prices are very reasonable.    Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Every time I going to Pittsburgh, whether it's for show or sporting event, stop a Christos for dinner. It's a small family-owned restaurant all the food is homemade and everything I've tried has been delicious. They also have a dessert called the Jackie O cake which is simply fantastic. I would highly recommend this restaurant box if you like Mediterranean food. The staff is friendly warm inviting as well."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Christos! We went to Christos after a show at the Benedum Center and again before a baseball game. The setting is a very cute little greek place, it's a small place. The people that work there/own it are very nice and really want you to enjoy the food, They do stand outside of the restaurant giving menus to try and get you to eat In there, but we did end up trying it and we liked it! The owner told us a story that he actually has cooked food for Jackie O on a cruise ship."}
{"text":"This can be summed up as follows: For Greek food, go to Salonika directly across the street.  This place is below par in just about every way. The prices are not high, but the servers seem more like salesmen in pressuring you to add dessert, etc. (At lunch?). I haven't been impressed by the food after numerous tries, and the atmosphere is dated and dingy.  I would much rather go across the street at a place with no pretensions (counter service) and pay for honest food that I can see being prepared."}
{"text":"Christos is a cute little place. It's been there for 38 years and I think that it hasn't changed much over the duration.  Sure the place is kitschy, but that's part of the charm.  The antiques and old photos were interesting to me, and there's some nice pieces there. The service is friendly, down to earth, and warm.  The owner showed me an award for the \"Jackie Onassis cake\" from 2009.  While I want to love this place, the food is sub-par.  While the hummus was good (indeed thin as mentioned elsewhere) the Hercules special(lamb, beef, beans over rice) was just so-so.  I want to see this place continue to succeed, but the food quality needs to be turned up a notch if that's going to happen.  I'm rating 2.5 stars, but rounding up for the reasons mentioned."}
{"text":"Descriptive phrase: classic Greek.  Christos is unassuming, but good. Katie K., her sister, and I were wandering around downtown Pittsburgh on a Sunday night and many other things were closed. We stopped briefly to look at the menu that was laid on a table outside, and a nice old man came right out and invited us in. So we followed him.  It's a cramped little space, made even more so by the insane amount of Greek relics/touristy items everywhere. Even on a Sunday night, though, the place had a good and varied crowd ranging from teens to families to old men hanging around.  Our waiter, who I found out later was the owner, was odd in a fantastic way. He just was bright and quick, and obviously loved his lot in life.  We started with the Hummus ($4) which came with fresh, hot pita bread. The bread was great, but I didn't enjoy the hummus (too bland). We each had a glass of the house wine (red and white) (~$3?) which were delicious. I ordered the Lamb Kebab ($12.95) which came with some grilled veggies and rice pilaf on the plate but also included a soup/salad. I loved the soup. LOVED it. It was a milky broth with rice. Sounds odd, but perfect for me as I was getting over a cold, and went well with the pita bread from before. The grilled veggies were good, and I really liked the rice pilaf. The lamb kebab was not bad, but Katie K's was so tough she didn't eat much of it. I did not have the same problem, though we'd order the chicken next time.  We finished the night with Baklava ($3) and the famous Onassis Dessert ($3). The owner regaled the entire place with the story of how he worked on the Jackie O yacht for years and this was her favorite dessert. Goodness, I can understand why. It looks like a simple slice of vanilla cake but it's so much more, with a honey syrup and whipped cream with cinnamon. I want it. I want it now.  Overall, it was a 3-star kind of place. Good but not great. The dessert and wine were top notch, but it lost points on the main entree and the price (which I thought would be reasonable but topped out at $25 a person with tip!). Christos' saving grace is its ambience and staff. Check it out if you have the time."}
{"text":"I'm definitely a fan, if not for the food for the authentic atmosphere! In my opinion it's hard to mess up Mediterranean food, and Christos doesn't. But I really like this place for the authenticity, intimate dining area, and perfectly awkward and warm interactions with the waiters and owner. If you're looking for classic, no frills Mediterranean food, this is the place!"}
{"text":"This place is something. By that, I mean interesting. We were fished into the restaurant by one of the employees. That's the thing about Christos, their employees stand outside with a menu pressuring people to come in. I'm not sure if this is working hard or just desperate. It could be that Christos is one of many Mediterranean restaurants on 6th Ave and they need to stand out somehow. My husband and I decided to give it a chance and the food was decent: flavorful, comforting and decently priced. He got the Chicken Kebab and I got the Souzoukakia and Spanakopita Combo. The decor seemed a little outdated too but I'm ok with that, it gives the place some charm. However, it was the attitude of the employees towards each other that just turned me off from this place. Our waitress kept saying how Christo, the owner, was rude and we should be happy we got her as our server. And the two of them seemed to fight for each customer that walked in. Whether they like each other or not, this really shouldn't be evident to customers."}
{"text":"We were downtown looking for some place to eat before the show when I man standing outside showed us a menu. Boy, we were not the least disappointed. After hummus and pita chips, we all started off with an excellent very tasty fresh salad. The leg of lamb of excellent as was the sides of grilled vegetable and rice. I don't usually like hummus but it was tasty and excellent. The Jackie O cake is to die for.  We agree that the waiter were sort of odd, but in a very good way. Excellent prices. Homemade wine was also excellent."}
{"text":"The food here is authentic and tasty and the place itself is a gem of kitch. Do not go here if you want a fine dining experience. The servers are odd, but that's part of the experience. The dining room may be cluttered with old photos, objects representing Greek culture and other oddities, but again that's part of the charm. The food is really, really good and I believe it is very well priced for what you get.   They also have this amazing soup that seems to have magical powers when it comes to curing a cold. Fabulous!"}
{"text":"I loved the food. The salad was delicious and I had a fantastic lamb kebab and cheese pastry for the main course.  The ambiance was a little strange but ultimately charming and nice. We were there right before the symphony and ballet were starting (reservations at 6 before shows at 8) and it was super crowded. The main floor was at capacity but we were told to go back through the kitchen and downstairs into the basement. It was utilitarian, to be sure (cinder blocks, plastic deck furniture) but not really a problem.  The terrible aspect of it--and the reason this wasn't more stars--was the service. Our waitress was either dealing with all the tables upstairs as well or just didn't know what was going on, because she seemed totally and utterly bewildered (beyond the usual frazzled state of a busy waitress). Totally in over her head. We were there sitting down to order at 6:15 and our main course wasn't there until around 7:20, by which time we needed to be finishing up so we didn't miss our 8:00 events.  I know some of this has to do with the kitchen being busy and it wasn't her fault, but that was still problematic. A half dozen times she came by and said it'll just be a few more minutes. We ordered a hummus appetizer and she brought too few pita bread pieces, and then took forever to get more.  This is a nice down home place and at any time other than the pre-theater rush, is probably a great restaurant. But if you're in a rush to get to an event, give yourself at least two hours."}
{"text":"This is the lowest rating I have ever given a restaurant because I usually follow Yelp review suggestions to a T.  So,  I have eaten at many dilapidated, small, mom & pop businesses that looked shabby but served excellent food.  I wonder how they are staying in business.  I ordered a fish enter for lunch that was supposed to be accompanied by SPINACH... and I'll just let the pictures speak for themselves ."}
{"text":"The first time I give a critique on yelp. But that experience was horrible, just read all the prior negative reviews about all the dirty tricks."}
{"text":"We were starving late night after a Steelers game. Knowing most places were closing within thirty minutes, we were ready to settle for a slice of pizza. Came across the menu on the street and were pulled in with a warm welcome and full menu. Great people watching sitting outside. Treated like we were family. I enjoyed the hummus appetizer most. The homemade wine was fantastic as well. I most loved the atmosphere and warm, welcoming service. Awesome prices too."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. It's not fancy but the food is excellent and homemade. I love the charm of the restaurant as well and the owner Christos. He and Demetrius are so kind. We had hummus as an appetizer and it was the best hummus I have ever had. I got the spanikopita dinner. It came with a salad (which was great) rice pilaf veggies and the spanikopita. I also ordered the lemon potatoes. Everything was excellent. My friend ordered a lamb dish which he also really enjoyed. The Jackie O cake is amazing! The owner used to be a chef for Jackie and used to make that cake for her. It is fantastic. This time I ordered mine to go and Demetrius made a different type of whipped cream for it so that it did not melt.  I don't live super close to the city so it's a little difficult to get there but I definitely will be trying to get there more often!"}
{"text":"Pittsburgh's hidden gem for authentic Mediterranean fare.  Original dessert for Jackie Onassis by her chief!  Become a part of history. Try it!  Amazing and addictive.  We stopped for pre theatre dinner and returned post theatre for the dessert! No regrets. Tiny place with limited seating. Service is slow but atmosphere makes up for it."}
{"text":"I love Christos, this place has been here since I was a teenager (perhaps even before) and has had the same menu that whole time. If you want authentic, homey Greek food made with love and personality, you should eat here. Amazing place for a date, very romantic. My favorite dishes are Tiropita, Christos chicken, the potatoes and the Jackie O cake. The Greek coffee is also not to be missed if you like coffee. Bonus they are open late."}
{"text":"Tasteless food. Too slow service. Was waiting for my check about 15 minutes. Dishes were as an ex-USSR buffet taste. Annoying waiter."}
{"text":"Definitely a restaurant that is from the past.  Authentic Greek food.  I had the pastichio and it was one of the best I have ever had.  Great flavor and very creamy.  My wife had roasted leg of lamb which was very moist and a good flavor.  Christos came over and told us of his three years he was the chef on Jackie Onassis yacht.  It was like eating at home with family.  A little over sell of the food did raise up the check a bit but you can't blame them for asking."}
{"text":"Food is always solid. The Jackie O cake is outstanding. Christos is like walking into your grandfather's living room. Yes, they try to sale wine, apps etc. But this is a family run business, so I will give them some slack. Plus, I admire what the owner did for the homeless guy who used to live in the alley behind the restaurant"}
{"text":"I found this jewel of a restaurant while I was staying in Pittsburgh for a month. I was stressed out trying to find healthy vegetarian food in a full on Meat n Potatoes city when finally I came across Christos! WOW! I fell in love with the service & food so much I was coming everyday until I left back to Hollywood, CA. In fact I haven't found such a great traditional Greek restaurant here in LA that can compare to Christos. Everything I had was superb especially the lentil soup, so amazing! For dessert you must try the \"Jackie O\"... so good.   I am shocked to find such an amazing restaurant in a town like Pittsbrugh and even more shocked to read a few of the *less than 5 star reviews* of Christos here on Yelp. I believe a restaurant like this is far above & beyond Pitts peeps."}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorite places to eat in Pittsburgh.  The meals are a little bit more expensive than you normally want to eat as a student (I probably spend $20-25 with appetizer and dessert), but the food makes this hole-in-the-wall truly worth a trip.  Christo is the owner of the restaurant and was at one time employed upon the Onassis yacht.  Years ago when I first came to his restaurant, he was the head waiter on a staff of one.  More recently when I have gone, there have been other hired waiters.  The service isn't great, but it's not terrible either.  The food offerings include standard middle eastern fare: hummus, baba ghanouj, phyllo-dough wrapped pockets, and kabobs.  The desserts also include standard middle eastern desserts like baklava and strong coffees, but the signature dessert is the Onassis dessert, a syrup-soaked cake topped with custard and whipped cream, dusted with cinnamon.  The last time I was there, he had added a chocolate Onassis dessert, which was also excellent.  My normal meal there consists of baba ghanouj (which is about the best I've ever had....it's a real hit-or-miss dish, and Christo's knocks it out of the park), a combination (lamb & chicken) kabob, and the Onassis dessert.  It's out of the way, but well worth a trip!"}
{"text":"Try the Jackie Onassis cake. I experienced this cake for the first time during my time as a student at Point Park University. The perfect ending to an evening after a night at the theatre or a very reasonably priced very authentic Greek restaurant to have dinner at before going to see a show. It may not look fancy but as I've always said don't judge a book by its cover."}
{"text":"Dirty, unclean, my friend and I went to lunch here.  She went to go to the bathroom. Upon returning to the table had the following story to tell.    To get to the bathroom she had to go through the kitchen and down a flight a stairs.   When passing through the kitchen she saw raw chicken left out in the heat congealing in it's own blood.    Christos you get no second chances after a stunt like that.  The food was tasty, but come on now chicken chillen on the counter is a no go in anyone's kitchen."}
{"text":"This is a charming, authentic, and adorable little restaurant! Christos, the owner, is very sweet and hard-working, and managed to serve  a full restaurant of people! Although it took a little while for our food to get there, when it did it was delicious! Highly recommend if you enjoy authentic Greek cuisine and a cool family-run environment."}
{"text":"So....I read the reviews on Yelp & Urban Spoon. Mostly negative, but hey I was hungry and gave it a shot. It's true the place is dingy & like entering a Greek grandfather's home.  I was first asked  if I wanted huumus. I declined that after reading is was mediocre at best. So I tried the $5.25 saganaki. It came out in an old brown dish with what looked like rubber floating in lemon juice and oil. * The owner failed to mention the pita bread was extra. It tasted WORSE than it looked (if that was possible). Tough cheese mostly tasteless and chewy. * I have had many saganaki in various countries. This ranked as one of the VERY worst! I made the best decision to leave before food poisoning set in. Bottom line:  HORRIFIC !!!"}
{"text":"Went with my husband before seeing a show so it was an early dinner.  Great time for dining because it wasn't real busy. Christos was so welcoming and attentive, not to mention full of Greek charm!  Food was wonderful and very flavorful- we had dessert and Greek coffe- everything was perfect! We brought our wine and beer- some places do t let you do that. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"So our intentions were to eat at the Indian place across the street however a lady ran across the street and started rattling off the menu as we were walking. At first I liked her moxy, but soon realized that if this is how they need to bring in customers we may be in trouble. Another mistake was sitting outside when they are trying to bring people in. Our dinner conversation was constantly interrupted by the servers yelling across the street and on the side walk at potential customers.   Now on to the food:  I ordered the chicken kabob. Very bland and it actually tasted baked not grilled. I didn't finish it.  The rice was good and the side veggies weren't bad. The spinach pie was ok.   They will ask \"would you like hummus to snack on before your meal\". This is not free or included. I figured this so I wasn't caught off guard. Some people I could see will be surprised at the end when they get the bill.   My wife got the lamb kabob. Bland again and very chewy. It didn't taste fresh, almost frozen at one point and microwaved. The cheese pie was pretty bad.  Hummus was ok.   2 stars for the food 3 stars for service 1 star for the experience with yelling and fishing for customers. Seems like they may be in trouble financially and could be cutting corners to stay afloat.   I will not go again. Alihan's next door is amazing, I recommend them over Christo's every day."}
{"text":"After reading a lot of negative reviews, I was a little hesitant but, wanted to experience the authentic Greek food so close to where we would be for the evening and in town. We had a Resturant.com certificate and wanted to use it before a baseball game. I wouldn't say it's a \"hole in the wall\" more a small charming authentic Greek restaurant with a lot of culture to offer in décor. The owner was very pleasant to speck to and gave us personal attention, once he found out I was a huge Jackie O fan. Yes I loved the Jackie O cake! To find out he was a Chef on the Jackie O yacht I was drawn in. The food was great. True I would not venture to the restrooms, but knowing all the negative going in, I was prepared. I enjoyed talking with him and I loved the Jackie O stories he told us. It was an experience, I am glad we had dinner there, we love Greek food. I may return."}
{"text":"Christos was one of the worst experiences I've ever had while dining in Pittsburgh. They call this a Greek restaurant but they don't even have a normal gyro on the menu. My boyfriend and I decided to split the platter, which was horrible. The gyro meat wasn't off the spick, the dolmades were the worst thing ever eaten in my life and they charged us 4.00 to split it which we didn't even ask for in the first place. The only pleasant thing about this place was the cook who ended up serving us our food after our waiter went out for what seemed like a drug deal. Over all, everything was bad and I would never return and would advice everyone else to do the same."}
{"text":"Christos is amazing. From the authentic cuisine to the owner with an intriguing life story (go in and talk to him, just a hint, he was a personal chef to someone famous!!!) it's an all around delight. They give you fresh hummus while you peruse the menu. My husband tried the homemade wine (made by the owners father) he loved it. We then shared an order of the lemon potatoes. They are perfectly seasoned and melt in your mouth. So tender yet still perfectly browned. I had the Pastichio. A beautiful combination of tender ground beef, light tomato sauce, pasta, the perfect spices, and a layer of something cheesy. My husband and I play a game, who ordered best, and I won this round hands down. But not by much. He ordered the Exohiko, or Shepards pie with lamb. The crust was flakey and brown and crunchy, while the inside was saucy, flavorful, and everything you could want.   We finished our dinner with the Onassis Dessert. This fluffy cake drizzled in a sweet sauce topped with a fluffy frosting was the perfect ending to a great dinner.  This was a reasonably priced dinner for the downtown cultural district. Give yourself a little extra time if you're going to a show, but be sure to make this a stop!"}
{"text":"This place was fantastic. I stayed at a nearby hotel while in town for business and ate at this place most nights. Delivery straight to my room, fast service, very reasonable prices and portions and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"When you find the entire restaurant empty leaving Heinz Hall on a busy Friday night ... it should have been your first warning sign. When the wine glasses are dirty and your attempt at conversation with the waiter is met with stairs at a mobile phone ... you should have left. The leg of lamb was a bit better than okay and the moussaka a disaster. Our waiters left without saying goodnight and we had to shout in to the kitchen to get the owner's attention ... I should not have left a tip (but did). Not a single customer in the hour we spent at this restaurant. Never again!"}
{"text":"Another great visit here...only stopped in for the infamous Jackie O cake...absolutely delicious! Great company as well! Congratulations again on making it in \"The Table\" (Summer 2018 edition) - well deserved!"}
{"text":"Australian here travelling from sydney and a lover of Greek food and all Mediterranean Cuisine. After traveling through the states i was after some real home made type food. I ordered some hummos and bread, leg of lamb with rice and vegetables (and of course Greek salad). Waiting for my meal the place looked a little run down but at the same time homely. There are pictures of family and their history all around. The server (who i think was the owner) and the Chef were two of the lovliest men i have met. I ordered my food to go as i had to get back to the hotel. The food was SO good i almost made myself ill trying to eat more. The most DELICIOUS hummos i have ever had. I also got talked into a dessert cake he called the \"Jaqui Onassis\" a Vanilla cake with fresh cream and cinnamon. Also lovely. Not a bad word to say about this place. Don't let looks deceive you!! This place is the real deal."}
{"text":"After a filling brunch at Six Penn, our friends convinced S and I to go to Christos for dessert. They come to Christos often for \"date night\" and I can totally see why. It's a very cozy spot and it's very warm and welcoming.   We saddled up to a table for 6 even though we were only a party of 4. We were also the only other party in there aside from what appeared to be the owner, Christos' family celebrating a birthday.  We ordered regular coffee, Greek coffee, teas and two slices of the Jackie O Cake. The Greek coffee had quite a presentation (served on a big copper tray and my friend said it was very strong. The Onassis cake is soaked in syrup and topped with custard and whipped cream. It is also dusted with a layer of cinnamon (which may or may not be a dealbreaker for some) and I recall a drizzle of honey on the plate. The cake was very moist and tasted very fresh. I liked that the whipped cream served as the \"frosting\" because anything heavier than that would have spoiled the taste in your mouth (the textures wouldn't match). I swore when we arrived, I was entirely full from brunch but managed to wolf down half of my shared slice anyway. So yes, my friends, I loved the cake and was impressed.  Before we left, we had the privilege of having Christos' (granddaughter?) serenade us with some violin-playing. He also stopped by our table frequently and chatted us up. He seemed genuinely glad to have us drop in and make us feel like part of the family.  Next time I'm in Pittsburgh, I'm coming back for the spanakopita because from what I hear, it's pretty awesome."}
{"text":"This place was really gross.  There was no one around when we went in, but we were starving.  The food wasn't fresh, the dishes were dirty, and I felt like I was going through Pan's Labyrinth to get to the bathroom, which was pretty far away, seemingly in another dimension.  It was almost an adventure.  There was old black slimy greens in my salad, but at least the watermelon in the salad was good!  I'll give them that!  The olives were even disgusting--how do you mess up olives?  The spanokopita was limp and oily and devoid of much phyllo.  And there were copious bugs flying around our food the whole time we dined.    When we paid, the cashier asked how much of a tip we wanted to leave, and added it directly to the bill  instead of giving us the opportunity to leave our own tip or write it on the restaurant receipt.  The bill was way too high.  If you really hate someone, you should take them to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Light Up Night.  Food has good flavor but doesn't look so hot.  If I hear about the Jackie O desert one more time I'm gonna barf."}
{"text":"This is an excellent restaurant if you are willing to have an open mind and have some time to just sit and hang. He brought my friend and I his homemade red wine (in a juice glass of course) and it was amazing! I got the tebouleh and lemon potatoes. Absolutely delicious. And of course, the infamous cake. Christos is very friendly and you can tell how much pride he has in his family restaurant. If you're looking for something authentic and endearing, this is the place! If you're looking for perfect service and perfectly timed foods and such, go to Applebee's."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars  Christos is a sort of charmingly run-down sort of place, particularly given that many of the other offerings in the Cultural District are pretty new joints.  The food is better than average.  Having just eaten at DC's supposedly cheapest and best Greek restaurant the week I was in Pittsburgh, I found the food to be more authentic, better seasoned, fresher and definitely cheaper.  We had a group of 10 on a Sunday night.  The restaurant owner/manager/old Greek guy came out onto the sidewalk as we were walking by and practically begged us to come in.  I had a grilled fish dish that was nicely cooked along with a glass of the house red wine.  At the end of our meals we decided we had to try the famous \"Jackie O cake,\" which was, sad to say, nothing particularly special.  Best of all, we had no problems splitting the check multiple ways when it came time to leave."}
{"text":"Christos reminds me of the ethnic restaurants you'd see throughout Europe or large American cities.  The owner or one of the staff is often outside encouraging patrons to check out the menu and come inside.  It may seem odd in Pittsburgh since most other places don't do that,  but it is fairly typical in other cities.  I've been to Christos several times now and been happy with each visit.  The biggest down side for me is that they can be very pushy, especially if the owner is waiting on you.  Also, they will ask if you want hummus and pita when you first sit down.  While it is absolutely worth getting (I love the flavor of the hummus) note that it is NOT a free item like getting bread at another restaurant might be.  Just be aware so you aren't surprised when you see it on your bill.  They have a red and a white house made wine.  They are both pretty sweet, but tasty.  I just wish the glasses were larger.  They are in pretty tiny glasses.  Try the Saganaki!  You can't go wrong with flaming, gooey tasty cheese.  Just be aware that when they bring it to your table, they will scream 'Opa!\" and either whistle or bang.  That really caught us by surprise.  The food is by no means gourmet, especially in presentation, but it is tasty and home made.  That has positives and negatives.  For example, I had the ground beef/noodle dish (can't remember the name and don't want to butcher it).  It was very tasty, but usually it has bechemel sauce over the top of it.  It was a little dry without it and I was told they don't have any to add on since it is baked right into the dish.     Most meals come with soup or salad, rice and roasted veggies.  The salads have a nice mix of veggies (tomatoes, green and red peppers and cucumbers) olives and even apples.  There is feta cheese and a nice and light dressing.  A perfect way to start your meal.  Their \"famous\" dessert is the Jackie O.  My husband tried it and loved it but I wasn't overly impressed.  They do offer several dessert selections including the staple baklava.  If you are in the cultural district and enjoy greek/comfort food, I suggest a visit to Christos."}
{"text":"My party of six ended up here today when most the restaurants in Market Square were closed.  We were fortunate for the detour.  The food was all excellent.  Especially the desserts.  Best baklava I can recall.  Their Greek coffee was a real treat.  The service was very friendly and genuine, and not excessive.  We didn't ask the prices when we said yes to glasses of homemade wine, the baklava, and their special Jackie Onassis dessert.  So the bill was a little higher than we expected, but everyone (students) felt it was money well spent."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly service of solid comfort food at a price that won't break the bank. It's good for pre-theater/concert dinners, especially if you want something that's not too fussy.  The food is fine, though perhaps not as out of this world as the gregarious owner would like you to believe. My moussaka was a tad on the bland side, but it was piping hot and hit the spot on a cold night. The desserts were definitely the highlight. My companions report that the homemade wine was also surprisingly good.  3.5 stars"}
{"text":"This is a family owned Greek restaurant. I ordered the greek country salad. It was such a refreshing option given all the \"American\" food spots in the DT Pitt area. I also had an iced tea with pita and hummus as an app. I was very pleased with the service. Nice owners."}
{"text":"The three stars are primarily for the history. The owner waited and bussed all the tables. He closed out the checks. He may have been doing some cooking or dishwashing in the back. He needs to hire some help. Our service was actually fine until we all wanted to check out at the same time so we could get to the play. Even then, we were able to get checked out fairly efficiently.   We started with appetizers. These were pretty good: Tzatziki, Tiropita, Skordalia with Fried Eggplant, and Saganaki Nothing fancy, but solid.   The main dinner entrees were not so good. Two of our party ordered chicken kebab and mixed grill kebab. Despite specifically asking if the kebabs included vegetables like tomatoes, there were none and everything was barely lukewarm. I had the gyro platter and was very disappointed that the gyro meat was not fresh from the spit, but just pressed slices from a package. Mine was also barely warm. Another person had the Mousaka. She said it was good but not warm.   So the famous chef who cooked for Jackie O was waiting tables, not in the kitchen. He may make stuff ahead of time and then hire people to warm it up in the microwave. I'm not sure. Mine was definitely not homemade, although the salad that came with it was good.   We brought our own wine and beer and that was ok with the owner. He just needs to return to his roots. Cook good food and hire folks to wait and bus the tables."}
{"text":"This was one of the most disgusting restaurants ive ever been in.  First decided to sit inside.  There were nats flying all over the place.  So, I decided to sit outside as i had already ordered my food.  However, there were bugs all over the outside patio as well (probably from the standing water with plastic flowers in them).  I ordered a hummus and pita (which they made me think was free but charged me for) a glass of wine, and a chicken kabob.  The food was decent at best.  Then, I go to check out, my dinner was $25.  Better yet the cook who was checking me out had the nastiest yellow finger nails i have ever seen.  I thought i was going to throw up but i was too motivated to get out of there."}
{"text":"Don't miss this amazing little authentic family run Greek restaurant. The owner waited on us himself and he's very good at the \"up sale\"   Delicious homemade pita and hummus and delicious Greek dressing. Lovely atmosphere and very clean. A+++ for Christos!"}
{"text":"Okay, so this is a disappointment. This is my second visit and so I thought I would try some other stuff. I had the greek country salad and the Gyro sandwich. The up side is that they can make a mean salad. The Gyro was like no other that I have ever had before and I have had quite a few. I didn't like it. The meat tasted a little weird and the pita was like one you'd buy at giant eagle. The total tab was $9.52 (they have reasonable prices).  Here's the major docking points: they have a real cleanliness problem. My water glass was dirty. Both Christo and the cook had very dirty hands. Think auto mechanic dirty. The cook came from the back and accepted my cash (yes, the cook) and I noticed he had a cut on his finger! I wanted to regurgitate my meal like a camel!  I don't know how this place stays in business since on both visits in the middle of lunch rush there was only one other customer. However, he does attempt to up-sell every customer, but it is hard to understand him, so I think people just agree with his suggestions and then pay for it.  Christo's a nice guy but excessive filth is unacceptable and I don't plan on returning. I am adding a new category to my reviews: cleanliness!  Food Quality/Taste = 2 Stars Portion Size Given Price = 4 Stars Price = 4 Stars Service = 3 Stars Experience with Staff = 3 Stars Decor = 3 Stars  Cleanliness = 0 Stars!"}
{"text":"This place is a run down, out dated, hole in the wall restaurant with slow service and creepy decor.. and it's fabulous.   When you walk into the Christos, don't expect to be greeted- you won't be (unless someone pulled you in off the street). Plan on walking to the back to find someone who may or may not seat you, or you may be told to sit wherever you want.  I would recommend sitting outside, although not your typical \"patio seating\" ambience,  it's (in my opinion) the better option. It's teeny tiny and super old school. The menus are old and messy, but you're not eating those anyway, right?  So all of that aside, Christos is a really fantastic little family owned authentic Greek place that serves really great food. They serve it slow, but they serve it good!  I ordered the hummus and pita bread as an appetizer  (yummm) and the Greek Pizza as my meal, and it was so good! I really loved it, and you can't beat the prices. My lunch was all of $12, and I ordered a soft drink, an appetizer, and a pizza that came with a salad... and it was good!   The point to me pointing out all of the negatives first was that you can't ignore the obvious and pretend it doesn't exist.. truth is, all that stuff is true. But if you're prepared for it and willing to overlook it, you will leave pleased. Just keep in mind that it is a family owned establishment- there's no advertising, no sponsors, no corporate funding.. don't go in expecting top notch service, or hip decorations. But do go in expecting genuine, sincere service and great food. Give Christos a chance, maybe it's your thing and maybe you can't get on board, but I will always look past an exterior for good food and to support a local business!"}
{"text":"First the good. Delivery to the Wyndham Grand hotel was prompt. Prices were reasonable. The eggplant and spanikopita in the hot combination were really good, and the baklava was decent, although the walnut pieces were large and the dessert just fell apart.   Then there's the not good. Beverage was small ($2 for about 8 oz of tea and a whole lotta ice). And the entire gyro platter was just bad. Gyro meat was obviously pre-frozen and sliced, just heated up there, with a mealy texture. Hummus was lumpy and watery, although not horrible tasting. The pita was dry. And my salad was floating in 1/4 inch of water.   I wouldn't order from here again."}
{"text":"This was, without exception, the best Greek food I have ever eaten. We started with a fabulous hummus. It was smooth, with just enough garlic, served with fresh, soft pita. The salad was fresh and crisp, with a delicious homemade dressing. My husband had braised lamb shank. It was perfectly seasoned and falling off the bone tender.  I had Greek meatballs and spanakopita. The owner was delightful, and we took dessert back to our hotel."}
{"text":"texts to a friend who didn't join us.....  You should have been here.  Had a great day.  Ended the day at Christo's instead of butcher in the rye.  Food was AWESOME!!!   Best Greek food ever.  And, Cristo remembered us and gave us all hugs when we left.   *winning*  Food better, more kid friendly, and MUCH less expensive than Butcher.  I had navy bean soup, hummus, and something called Greek shepherds pie - roasted lamb chunks, peppers, brown sauce, in phyllo dough.  Soooo. Good.   Kids got roasted lamb.   Lentil soup always a winner.  Greek lemon and chicken soup was so light and flavorful!!  If you haven't been there, make it a priority and go.  Plus, his 101 year old father makes the wine and it's AMAZING!!"}
{"text":"This place is something STRAIGHT out of a David Lynch film. It felt like I was transported to some sort of alternate reality with the help of a smiling, and overbearing greek man outside a restaurant door preying on the weak and indecisive. Something in the air of this place comes off as so fundamentally strange, and almost, discomforting and nightmare-like. You are going to feel uneasy, is what I'm trying to say.   - They overcharged us, probably intentionally. They don't have itemized receipts.  - The waiter kept giving us options as if they were... free options that you're supposed to choose. We caught on when we specifically asked if they cost extra. - The elusive bathroom felt like we were descending down the staircase to hell. Better than nothing, I suppose. - The food.... oh my god. None of our food was good. In fact most of it was outright gross/uneatable. The hummus was decent, but... I can also get decent hummus at Trader Joe's.   We initially felt bad for these guys. A struggling business is always sad to see. But with all of the strange behavior, attempts to scam us, etc. that sympathy turned into a sense of understanding as to why this place isn't doing so well.   If the owners are reading this-- I'm sorry if my review came off harsh.. but really, please, rethink the way you are going about your business. I don't want you to fail, I want you to overcome this. Do it the right way, not the scummy way. I know you're trying, but try differently."}
{"text":"Had dinner here one evening. Ordered the Greek salad with Feta cheese - AND a Gyro platter. plus a glass of lemonade.  Salad was very basic - iceberg lettuce with a smattering of other greens and onions, some feta cheese, dressing - and one olive. Just one.  Then the platter came out - two pieces of Pita bread, several long thin pieces of Gyro meat, hummus, rice - and another Greek salad. Now why the hell didn't the guy who took my order bother to tell me I got a salad with my Gyro platter?  I ate the Pita and Gyro meat along with the hummus and most of the rice. Interestingly enough - this second Greek salad had - drum roll please.....  One olive! Must be an olive shortage in Pittsburgh. I did not eat the second salad as I was all salad-ed out at that point. I did eat the second olive though.  Food IMHO was just average - it felt more authentic than some of these places that serve you the Gyro meat wrapped up in a piece of Pita with a yogurt sauce.  I got one refill on my lemonade. The older gentleman who took my order was not particularly outgoing or friendly. In fact he was kind of gruff and standoffish - I was very friendly and polite during my visit."}
{"text":"I had been to Christos 3-4 years ago it is was good so i took my family back for a Saturday lunch.  It was honestly the worst restaurant experience I have had in Pittsburgh in 20 years. We ordered a variety of things and everything was either below average or almost inedible.  The water glasses were so dirty no one drank from them.  The bill does not have any details, just a slip of paper they write on so I don't really know what I paid for.  I feel bad because we try to frequent small family places and the owner seems nice but this place has slipped from OK to possibly not safe based on cleanliness.  My last visit."}
{"text":"I can not believe how this place treated me. I ordered food from them at 7:00pm. I called them at 8:15pm when the food had not arrived and they said they were 5 minutes away. I called them again at 9:00pm and they said the driver got a flat tire but he will be here in 1 minute. He finally got here at 9:10"}
{"text":"This is my first time in Pittsburg. I asked the concierge for a recommendation for something casual that I could walk alone to at dusk safely and that wasn't a sandwich.  He recommended Christos.  I asked if they had falafel as this is one of my favorites since visiting Israel last year. He assured me they had great falafel. So I set off on a walk. When I arrived I noticed there was no falafel on the menu. But another of my favorites was - pastitsio. I took it to go along with the Jackie Onassis cake. The pastitsio isn't the best one I have had but it was good. It came with salad, rice, and Greek style green beans.  The Jackie Onassis cake was very light and not sweet at all. The cinnamon sprinkled on top was great."}
{"text":"Owner, Christos Melacrinos, was a personal chef to Jacqueline Kennedy Onasiss aboard the Onasiss yacht. He is very friendly and runs a great restaurant. Tasty food and homemade wine! Everything came out quick and hot. And don't skip the dessert, \"The Jackie O\" is a vanilla cake topped with custard, honey, cinnamon, and whipped cream. Would recommend for those looking for an Authentic Mediterranean meal."}
{"text":"If you like rotting salad, rude staff, greasy food, stupid stories about Jackie Onassis and her favorite dessert then this is the place for you. Absolutely terrible. I cannot say a single good thing about this place, it's just tough to figure out how they remain in business."}
{"text":"Excellent everything! Classic family-run Greek restaurant. Home made everything, including great family-made Greek wine. Inexpensive and authentic. Christos, the owner is hospitable and welcoming. I come from NYC, and I say this is right on par with the Greek food back home."}
{"text":"They only have homemade wine and the dry white was good. We had hummus spanakopita, grape leaves, tabbouli, tzatziki and it was very good. By looking at the place u might not walk in normally, but i would go back.  The yelp review with the fruit flies really grosses me out but we didn't have any problem like that on our visit."}
{"text":"After a show at the Heinz Hall, decided to stop here, a short walk and beside the garage we parked in.  Chose this place on purpose as it is basically the first restaurant my husband and I dined in when being put up in a hotel downtown by my company on an apartment hunting weekend.  Now that we know our way around a bit more, decided to revisit.  This time, no one greeted us upon entering.  There was one other table of diners.  There was a gentleman in the back at the cash register along with a girl and a boy who barely looked old enough to work here.  They might have been family members but I don't know.  No one seemed interested in greeting us at the front of the restaurant so my husband walks back to ask if they are open.  They are.  Finally, the young male leads us to our table with menus.    We decide on the baklava sundaes.  They were reasonably priced -- 3.00 each -- and decently flavored.  I just want to say the experience was quite a bit different than the first visit.  The first visit had us excited to try the restaurant, as the woman who worked there (I'm assuming one of the owners) was eager to pull us in from the sidewalk and entice us with her menu offerings.  This time no one was excited to have us as diners and they seemed to wish we weren't there.  Quite a difference in personalities and style.  They need the enthusiasm of the woman we had met before because there certainly were other Greek restaurants nearby with more patrons partaking of their fare."}
{"text":"WARNING. DO NOT GO HERE.  My family was visiting my sister in Pittsburgh and we had our eyes set on a specific restaurant, not Christos. A gentleman, I presume the owner of Christos, saw my family and I as we walked down the street. He flashed us his menu, pitching to us why his restaurant was the best and why his food was the best. I could barely tell if he was selling food or used cars. I kindly told him we were not interested. My family, however, was indecisive when it came to getting a restaurant. We ending up wanting to go eat at the restaurant next door to Christos so we backtracked. Again the owner flashed us his menu, sensing our touristy indecision. I again declined and pointed to the restaurant I was heading to. He then ignored me and pan-handled to my two sisters, mother and wife. They gave in to my dismay. As they said \"sure...\" I looked inside the restaurant of Christos at peak dinner hours.  No one was inside.  Absolutely no one. As my family walked in and I rolled my eyes, I thought, well let's give them a chance...my whole family seemed to feel bad for the guy and I like Greek food.  As we got in, it seemed nothing was going on. We had just came back from kayaking so we needed to wash our hands. They didn't seem to have a restroom but they took my sisters and mother through the kitchen and downstairs to find one. The silence was broken when they finally put music on and suddenly a couple of kitchen helpers came out and looked like they were warming some of the kitchen equipment up.  Were we their only customers tonight? I bet we were. Before I could settle in, he casually asked if I liked pita and hummus. Obviously I said yes. He was asking me so casually when I didn't even have a menu, I assumed it was complimentary when he said he would get me some, but as I waited I found his restaurant on Yelp with my phone and the first review gave them one star and mentioned how the owner didn't tell him the pita was extra.  Great.   The rest of my family later came back from the restroom (akin to going to a restroom at a grocery store where you're around stock items...except you need to go through their kitchen). They started with salad. The waiter asked if I wanted anchovies or something else on my salad. I was going to say \"sure\" but my wife stopped me and said it could be extra. The waiter, looking like he got caught, verified he was offering all extras to me even though earlier the owner said salads came with dinner. I had to say,\"I just want the standard salad, nothing extra.\" I couldn't let my guard down.  We ordered some food, priced about what you'd expect.  The pita and hummus I ordered earlier was just barely average so I don't know why they thought it was worth $4. My sister ordered \"leg of lamb\" so I expected to see a leg of a lamb. Instead when her plate came out, it looked like sad slices of ham. Really. We all got vegetables but they were soggy and unappetizing. I saw them earlier in the kitchen sitting in a big pot when I had used the restroom. Nothing here is fresh. My lamb was on the chewy side. My sister's \"leg of lamb\" was left uneaten and she asked if I wanted some. I \"tried\" to eat it but it was too chewy. They then asked for dessert. I wanted to say no out of my discontent but again my family members all said yes, even when they were telling me the food was not great.  I don't have their sense of pity. The desert and salad were the best things of the night, which was kind of sad.   When we got the receipt and my wife insisted we check it.  Surprise. They overcharged us $7 from two mysterious items. Their receipt doesn't even list what you ordered. I went up the the cashier to ask them what the two items were. He tried to explain one but he really couldn't. He scratched out the $3 item. I then questioned the $4 charge. Again he tried to explain it but he really couldn't. Again he agreed with me and scratched out the $4.  On top of all this we still gave them a normal tip out of pity. I could tell the waiters were just following orders. I could tell the owner had trained them what to say and how to make extra money.  You've been warned. There's a reason why this place is doing so poorly.  There's a reason why the whole hour between 7:30pm and 8:30pm we were the only ones in the restaurant. There's a reason why the owner is begging customer to come in. They're cutting corners on customer service and food quality in exchange for salesman tactics, overcharging and tricking you to buy things you don't even know is extra. DO NOT GO HERE.  Owners like this will say,\"But I have to or else I won't make it.\" You know what? Restaurants like yours shouldn't make it. Not to be harsh but it was a poor experience. Change your food, your sales tactics and your fake receipt items strategy. Maybe a long time ago when they started they were real but now they are doing every dirty trick in the book to nickel and dime you.    WARNING. DO NOT GO HERE."}
{"text":"It is definitely an authentic mom and pop style little hole in the wall. All the food was very good, although it wasn't immediately clear that everything being offered to you is also being charged to your bill. So just accept what you are willing to pay for.  The salad with anchovies was excellent, best anchovies I have had in a while.  Roasted lamb led was not exactly what I expected. Sliced thin, and looked like ham slices. Well cooked and tasted good.   Some simple, home.cooked good food at good prices downtown."}
{"text":"Many of the reviews for Christos accurately reflect my experience today. I truly enjoyed the decor, the food tasted good, and it was inexpensive. My lunch was under $7. I had the gyro platter.  The waiter, who I assume is part of the family, was a bit creepy and kept asking if I wanted something additional like soup. When it came time to pay, I had to walk to the back and get his attention. He then called for another guy, also creepy and who I think is also part of the family, and he figured my bill by looking at my empty plate that was still at my table (which was at the front near the windows.)  He was suspicious that I didn't have more to eat.  At this point I was finding it humorous.  I am glad I went. It was an interesting experience that I won't soon forget."}
{"text":"The food from Christos was solid.  I would order from them again, although the hummus was a rather small portion for $4."}
{"text":"Ok, Yelpers, I've been relying on you for a couple of years, but...    Had a lovely meal at Christo's last night.  Someone I work with frequents and recommended.  Then I turned to the Yelp community for confirmation and was torn because of the number of seemingly dissatisfied reviews.  I decided to risk one meal (after all, how much of a risk is THAT, really??) and follow the co-worker's referral.  We started with the house-made wine.  Red for Friend and sweet white for me.  Served in a juice glass and yummy enough for both of us to order another. Hummus.  Not bland at all.  Freshly made and pleasingly lemony.  Pita was soft and fresh, as well.  Greek salad.  Iceberg / Romaine mix with olives, green onions, and bit of marinated sweet red pepper.  Anchovies if you want 'em - and I always do!  Nice sized and great tasting. I cannot comment on the dressing as I abstained (anchovies do the trick for me).  The meatball dish was had by Friend and the lamb kabob for me.  Both dishes came with rice and stewed veggies.  We cleaned our plates and thoroughly enjoyed our meals.  The seating area is old.  The décor is old.  The pictures on the wall are authentic and include images of the owner as a child and through his life.  This is not a typical city restaurant and is certainly not competing with Alihan's, next door, or any of the other white linen establishments.  There is no input from 'corporate' and I counted four men working, total.  This is a come-as-you-are-and-I'll-sell-you-good-food kinda spot.  And that's what we did.  And that's what they did.  Sometimes it's just that simple."}
{"text":"20160421  UPDATED REVIEW  This place is fun for us.  Chrisos is unique.  The wall art and photos are unique to the region.  I discovered last night that we had visited many of the same places in Greece.  This is as close as one gets to old world hospitality in the Pittsburgh area.  Every photography has a story and backstory.  Excellent to camp out before a play.  No pressure relaxation; view of the street, and even tables on the sidewalk area for watching folk.  Homemade wine -- red is better.  This is not a wine fu-fu place at all.  If you know what Tarpon Springs Florida is about, then you need to visit Christos.    I will update this review as we revisit the venue.  Hopefully, I can visit there in the afternoon and begin photographing his photographs.  This is just unique.  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Lovely find specially in the era of chains.  Unique storied history.  Food solid.  Excellent service.  Amusingly fun moments with staff and others in place.  One group has come to the place about 4 times a year over a decade.  Hugs all around.  Alicia received a nice hug from Christo.  There are stories there than need to be brought out given the time he and others left Greece.  Roy."}
{"text":"I'm with the 5 stars reviewers.  Ate at a little table outside before the Jon Meacham lecture at Heinz Hall and could not have enjoyed the food, wine, outdoor dining, friendliness, and prices any more than we did ... my friend and I both agree ... great little charming low key Greek restaurant.  We are not the biggest eaters but both had a slice of eggplant with a red sauce over rice and green beans nicely seasoned ...  all delicious ... and of course pita and hummus served quickly when we arrived.  Everything was very good and we shared a large Greek salad with enough to put into a take-out box which was held for us until after the lecture ... friendly ... delicious, ... tasty and healthy .. thumbs up!     Try it ,,, I think you will like it!  Can't wait to go back ..."}
{"text":"Barely three stars. I really wanted to like this place given its location, but came away disappointed. The owner was friendly enough, but was telling the same tired stories to each table about cooking for Jackie Onassis 40 years ago.  Food was uneven--Moussaka itself was reasonably good but the sides were not. Was not impressed with the Baba, Hummus, or Tabbouli and did not find the pita to be edible. The owner was pushing his \"famous\" lemon potatoes which were, unsurprisingly, boiled potatoes with a squirt of lemon juice and a sprinkle of oregano and quite ordinary.  What saves Christos from being banished in the abyss of a two star rating is the prices--at $10-13 per entree in the cultural district. But you always get what pay for and Christos is no exception.  Personally I think Alihan's next door is much much better for Turkish/Greek food and only moderately more expensive."}
{"text":"This is the first time in a long while (10 yrs?) and now I remember why. The food is fair at best for the main meal. The salad is good but small. The hummus is a little bland. The best parts were the \"homemade\" wine, both white and red, kinda like adult kool-aid  and the Jackie O cake was great. My issue was the price, $59. for dinner for 2. For this price, I would have expected more.I can't believe the 4 and 5 star reviews that I have read on this site. It's hard to believe that this place rates so many opposing reviews. I will never go back here again."}
{"text":"Off the path Greek restaurant, in a town with a million restaurants, this was one of our favs. It is homey, great service, good food and outstanding prices. Go there just to meet the owner Christos, a remarkable man who cooked for Jackie Onassis and offers her signature dishes. Fresh, homemade, and authentic cooking. Ask Christos for his recommendations. We loved the Greek coffee, homemade wine, and dessert. And the food was great too!"}
{"text":"Christos is a traditional Greek family-run restaurant.  As a Greek-American visiting Pittsburgh, I decided to stop in with my girlfriend before the Pirates game.   We shared some tzatziki with pitas and then ordered lamb kebabs (me) and leg of lamb (girlfriend).  Did I mention we love lamb?  Anyways, given that we basically ordered what I cook at home, the stakes were high, but Christos delivered! Our food was delicious, service attentive, and the whole thing was pretty speedy- we made it to our seats at PNC before the first pitch! This is a casual restaurant, good value, with a charming family feel."}
{"text":"Salad was awful, no dressing and the tomatoes you can tell were very old. Ordered the baked fish and it was 100% microwaved and very tart. Only thing good were the potatoes, and I think they were frozen. Country time lemonade? Like mom use to make.  barley 1 piece of spinach pie for $3.50. expensive and very bad food."}
