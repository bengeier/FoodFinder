{"text":"This is where I first tried bubble tea. Sencha (previously Steepery) has a pretty chill vibe and atmosphere. It's really simple to see all the selections and types of tea and the staff is great at recommendations. Plus there is a good ratio of outlets to people, which is perfect for a student like me. 

Recently I had a delicious chilled chocolate chai (try saying that five times fast). I had them throw in some tapioca pearls at the bottom and the perfect study buddy was complete. 

I really hope to try some loose leaf tea that they have there soon. The little pots and set that they serve the tea in are too cute! 

The prices are good, the tea is tasty, and the location on state is great for me. I love this place!"}
{"text":"I love Sencha to death - it's seen me through my best and worst times while I was in Madison for grad school. Everything about this place is magical - thank you for letting me plop down for hours to write my thesis, pretend it was an office for my students, and just gab away hours with my best friends!"}
{"text":"The new Steepery ! I like that they kept most of the menu the same. I am a big fan of their iced Royal Tea Latte. It is absolutely amazing ! It is a less creamier nuttier version of a thai iced tea. Their service is really fast and our drinks were ready before we finished paying the bill. The baristas are good at recommending combinations. They don't rush customers and at the same time the line moves fairly quickly even during the busiest hours.  It is not the best for huge groups but is perfect to catch up with an old friend or hang out before a movie or show !"}
{"text":"Amazing tea selection, enjoy the environment, great helpful staff.
Allergy warning: they don't have a list of ingredients. Makes it tough (staff will go find the bag...but when its busy its not fun)
Appreciate their milk alternatives"}
{"text":"Overall I think this place is nice for tea but it's unfortunately not my favorite. I had a matcha latte that tasted watered down and I couldn't really taste the matcha. It's a nice environment for playing games with friends or chatting. The servers are nice too. But I think the tea could be better. It may have been a one off that my tea did not have as much tea flavor though."}
{"text":"There iced chai with tapioca is my favorite bubble tea in Madison.

Service has always been quick and courteous.

Nice atmosphere, they have ice water available while you wait or enjoy your beverage.

I try to incorporate a pit stop here whenever I ride my bike through the downtown area of Madison."}
{"text":"Stopped in today to get my normal avocado banana bubble tea normally I get extra bottles that's a must. Just wanted to say again thanks for a great experience. staff was fantastic very accommodating and the most important thing the bubble tea was fantastic. What a great treat can't wait to come to Madison so I can enjoy a great bubble tea at sencha."}
{"text":"This place is alright! I ordered my drink wrong and didn't like the taste, but that's my bad.

Ambience is really awesome! Great place to meet up with a friend or do work. I'd say pricing is pretty average, and quality would be better than anywhere else around in terms of tea. Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"I used to go to this place all the time. The tea was mediocre but one of the baristas there made it worth it. Tall, dark hair, brown. I'm not sure if you all seen him. He made my day every time and he always brought a smile to my face. I suffer from anxiety , and it was nice to smile once in a while. But I went in and was told that he was let go because he had a \"different personality\". I tried talking to management. That was when I noticed all the workers were white. The only colored person was let go. THIS PLACE IS RACIST.  Never gonna come here again. 



Again, tea is mediocre. You can find cheaper tea elsewhere."}
{"text":"I recommend the iced lime green tea! Very nice workers but not super knowledgable about their teas (hence the 4 stars not 5) other than that, great place!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to try out a bubble tea. This was my first time and the tea blew my mind... Bubble tea newbies, imagine a sweet raspberry, strawberry, banana or watermelon flavored drink with fruit snacks at the bottom. You drink through a large straw so that you get the initial last of fruitiness, then suck up a few of the bubbles (\"fruit snacks\") to chew on.

Our barista was sweet and very friendly. The bathrooms were a \"beautiful as Beyonce\" just like the picture on the bathroom wall alludes to. This will certainly be one of my go-to places to for a dessert-y drink."}
{"text":"The two times I've been here, I've enjoyed it, especially on a hot day. The first time was on a weekend afternoon, which found me hot and thirsty. The place was packed, but they were having a special on a lavender tea drink which benefited low income college students. Being a sucker for a great cause, I got the drink and staked out a spot on the window high bar which overlooks State & Gilman. Great people watching from that vantage point, especially on a busy Saturday. The A/C was non-existent that day, it may have been that there were so many bodies crushed in to the small shop, because when I found myself downtown on a week day, it was perfectly cool. The second time around I got a iced green mango tea with chewy mango bits at the bottom. I preferred it in the huge heavy glass mug that in house orders are served in than getting a to-go cup. Very nice place to have a cool drink and relax. Cute little sidewalk seating area for those that want to sit outside, too."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for some Boba...but then that switched to Aloe bites so i was on a hunt to find a tea bar that would be able to satisfy my craving. I was on state street and came across this gem as it was before Kung Fu tea. I like the location and even the ambiance as you walk in, but I think management needs to figure out a better way with the lines/with customer service. I waited for about 15 minutes in line while a lady was trying to figure out what tea to buy and asking for recommendations. In this midst about 3 people left the line to go somewhere else since she was taking so long. tip to management-- have a manager or someone else talk to the lady about her tea purchase or start asking customers in line what to make them so all they have to do when they get to the front is pay.

Regardless, i waited as I was intent on getting my drink. I ordered a mango green tea with aloe. It was a little on the pricey side at about $4.50, but i was happy with it at the end as it was made quickly. The green tea flavor was still apparent and I should have asked for less mango syrup,but the aloe was great. Crunchy and delish. Overall i'll be back to try more teas and rack up some points on their system, but just be ready to wait if there is a person inquiring about tea purchases as they do have them on sale. 

Happy boba finding!"}
{"text":"I was a little overwhelmed at first looking through the menu for a standard boba milk tea. They have a lot of different options available, but I'm a simple bubble tea kind of guy. I ended up finding the Royal Black Milk Tea, and I was fairly pleased with it. Good tapioca pearls and the tea was sweet but not overly so.

The service was great. I got wrapped up in an email while waiting for the tea and they were nice enough to bring it over to me. I love that there is a lot of bar seating along with tables, which works well if I am just looking for a spot to work alone. One of the bars faces the cashier and back of the establishment and the other bar seating faces out onto State Street. 

I hesitate to recommend this place as a spot to have a conversation with a friend since it was fairly easy for me to overhear a chat from the next table over even though they weren't very loud and I was trying to avoid hearing them. I would say though that it is a good place to get in the zone and get some work done on State Street."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and have had great experiences both times! The first time was a bit awkward because the baristas weren't playing any music and the space is seriously small, so anyone speaking could be heard throughout the room. The service is also a bit slow-- the baristas are mostly college students and they often have lengthy conversations with other students about classes/college drama. A bit annoying to wait until they're done chatting, but they baristas are all really pleasant and helpful when they finally ring you up, and are happy to make recommendations. They can make drinks more or less sweet per taste, and everything is refreshing and yummy. I wish they had more snack options, but the tea is good and the space is cute. It's a nice place to study too, if you can get a seat!"}
{"text":"I had a pot of very good Japanese shade-grown green tea and a nice chocolate chunk muffin. I would definitely come back here. 

The tea was a very good price for the quality of the leaves, although it was a little over-steeped and therefore bitter by the time I got it. The reasons for this are twofold: 

1. The infusing basket was still in the pot when I received it, instead of being taken out at the right time before serving. Sadly, this happens at most coffee and tea shops I visit. 

2. There was a considerable amount of tea leaves in the infusing basket, to the point of being somewhat wasteful. Using this amount of tea might make sense for a quick steep to-go customer, but it makes oversleeping all too easy. 

With that being said, the tea's unfortunate bitter tinge was actually complimented by the chocolate muffin, so the rest of the flavors shone through brilliantly. Overall, it was a very enjoyable experience.

The tea menu has a fairly good selection, although there are too many flavored blends for my taste. I would like to see more oolong and pu'er varieties, but perhaps they don't sell as well. Even so, there are some real gems available!

The staff was friendly and helpful, and the shop has a comfortable and modern feel. It's a good place to take your time and savor your selection."}
{"text":"You might call it an obsession. The tea lattes are amazing. I do agree with some of the other posters, it was slightly better when it was Steepery but I still love it."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I discovered this place a few years ago and we've been a fan since! Sencha was formerly steepery fyi! 

The baristas there are really helpful! They know great combos for different tea flavors so if you're stuck definitely ask! So far my boyfriend and I have tried taro bubble tea , black lemon ice tea, and black milk tea. After having the black lemon ice tea with lychee bubbles I'm never going back! It's the perfect amount of sour and the lychee compliments the lemon so well!! The taro bubble tea is milky and the boba is pretty good! I always try to swing by to grab some tea!

The interior changed as well! They added a booth which adds more seating and it improves the overall look of the cafe. It's quite small so sometimes there's no seating. They also sell local art as well as tea accessories!

I'm a fan! Hope you guys like it too! :)"}
{"text":"Fantastic Bubble Tea!!!!!!  My children loved chillers and the tea!  The ladies where very helpful and informative and took the time to explain things.  I love that they don't use tops but a film that goes over the top of the glass.  I will definitely be returning to this place when I visit Madison.  It should be a stop for everyone!"}
{"text":"The bubble tea!!! Now granted there are very few places you can get bubble tea in this area, so, not much for competition. But this place is pretty outstanding. Many flavor combos to choose from. Covered in plastic with a big straw so good to go for strolling down State Street."}
{"text":"This place is the best. They have a wide variety of teas and bubble teas. I love coming here for their iced royal tea. They have really fun specials that are often updated. Staff is always friendly. They showcase local artists in their space too which is super cool."}
{"text":"Sencha will have a special place in my heart. I love their milk tea. Their milk tea tastes great hot or cold! They have a slight sweetness to their bubbles too! Aside from their milk tea, the taro shake is bomb! I love the taro shake with lychee jelly. Their traditional tea options are also great. Overall, I really enjoy the ambiance of Sencha and would recommend it to tea lovers who like he feel of classic coffee shops."}
{"text":"This Sencha location makes good drinks, so if you're in the State Street area stop in and get their Island Iced Tea with strawberry jellies. However do not make a special trip, just to visit this place. The inside is cramped, hot and always full of wannabe hipsters just sitting around. But if you do manage the courage to find a parking spot and stop in, you will find a helpful staff that will make you a good drink."}
{"text":"I love Sencha! Not too sweet and a huge variety of boba and other added jellies. Their tea selection is great as well, offering everything from hot or cold, to sweet or more mild in flavor, to milky or not. There is always a daily special which is a great way to save some money and also adventure away from your usual drink. And he place is always packed which speaks to how great it is!"}
{"text":"Favorite place to go to for a quick tea break! It has a very warm cozy atmosphere that draws you to stay longer than 30 mins. The tea bar has several options, I highly recommend the sweet tea boba as it's quite refreshing."}
{"text":"Sencha is my go-to drink spot on state! If you're not hungry for food but need some sort of a pick-me-up or a nice place to chill, it's a good idea. The teas are always refreshing and unique. I'm no boba expert, but I think it's delicious, especially with a hot or cold chai latte. I recommend the jellies for an iced fruity tea... but be careful, the drinks can come out pretty darn sweet! The baristas know their stuff (I've even seen them let customers smell the loose leaves to help them describe the flavors), and if you ask for a specific level of sweet, they should be able to cater. Get your drinks \"for here\" to sip the from a huge glass mug, and you can sit and read or study for a bit. The tunes are gooood, and it's an especially magical place around the holidays. It's eSENCHAlly the best. Haha. Ha."}
{"text":"Sencha (previously called Steepery), has a great environment for studying or meeting up with friends. They now have a bar--which I'm a big fan of. 

I am a huge fan of their loose-leaf teas--I would recommend getting a pot (saves you money). 
You can also get a side of milk and honey with it. (4 stars)

I am not a fan of the bubble tea there (2 stars). The chai tea tastes like it has artificial flavoring and the times I have gotten the thai tea, I've only taken two sips and thrown it away due to the lack of authentic taste. The bubbles do not have any flavor to them and are often either overdone or underdone."}
{"text":"Went to Sencha today and got a Royal Tea with cappuccino and bubbles.  I've tried lots of bubble tea places, and this was amazing! Not only was the tea great, but the staff was super friendly as well.  It also had a great atmosphere and was a great place to study for a little bit."}
{"text":"Popping bubbles are awesome with fruit shakes! I love it! I was there three days straight this week. I introduced flavors to my friends and they love them too. It is a really good place."}
{"text":"Great selection of teas, the staff knows their stuff.  I went when it was very busy, and I held up the line a bit deciding on what teas to take home - I never felt rushed (by the staff, the customers behind me were a bit grumbly).  Thanks, Sencha!"}
{"text":"This is pretty much the same as the Steepery was. I didn't notice too many differences. They still have my favorite mango black bubble tea. It's a pretty solid bubble tea shop choice and my preferred over the others I've tried in Madison.

The shop is cozy. The checkout area gets a little cramped still. The workers are nice. The tea is perfect. If you loved the Steepery, you'll love Sencha. If you never tried the Steepery, I'd highly recommend coming in and giving Sencha a shot."}
{"text":"3.5 stars for me. I am a big fan of this place in terms of atmosphere. It is a good place to go to in order to get some work done, and the atmosphere is cozy and cute. The boba is done well here and they have a lot of new and unique teas. In terms of personal taste, I think I prefer the taste of the milk teas at Kung Fu Tea, however, Sencha is a better studying environment. In addition, I tried some of their other seasonal teas (including a peach yogurt one and a mint one) that were unique and interesting. This is a place of hipsters, but if you're looking for something more traditional, maybe Starbucks or Kung Fu may be the place for you, depending on what you like."}
{"text":"The bubble tea was way better when it was Steepery, even better than Kungfu. I dont know if they changed the recipes when it became Sencha but the royal tea latte now tastes artificial sweetened.Also, I ordered the lavender lush, and it honestly tastes like medicine. I guess I'll stick with Kungfu Tea for now."}
{"text":"Sencha is my favorite place to stop! I go every time I'm in Madison (or their other locations in Minneapolis!) I've even asked them to open up a location in Mayfair Mall Milwaukee so I can go more often!! 
This place is legit. They use real tea in their drinks. And it's good! They offer drinks hot, iced, \"cooler\" or slushie like (my favorite), shake, and milk tea. Their boba is always cooked right and they even have seasonal flavors of popping bubbles. Their flavored boba teas use syrup instead of powder (ick powder is gross) and they have exciting flavors like lychee, passion fruit, hibiscus, and guava. 
They also have the best chai I've found in the many tea places I visit. It's nice and spicy instead of sweet. Very refreshing to drink! 
I love everything about sencha. They tend to be pretty busy being on state street but that way I know my favorite place will never close! Love it!"}
{"text":"I absolutely adore Sencha, such nice people and an amazing selection of teas. I love the Thai iced bubble tea. So so good. By far the best bubble tea I've had.
I would highly recommend checking it out, it's so worth it."}
{"text":"I love a good boba and the ladies here were nice. They made great explanations-good for non dairy like me. The Thai tea with Boba iced was refreshing on a hot summer day. It was made super quick and was a great size for the price. Nice seating area, understated music makes this a pleasure to sit. Outdoor seating is there but probably inadequate. Not much room to move and add so I get why not a lot of it. Really enjoyed this!"}
{"text":"Favorite place to stop. They are clean and always so nice. I usually get black milk tea with almond flavoring and bubbles. So good! It's a \"must go\" on my list."}
{"text":"Sencha replaced Steepery a few months ago, and was originally a Tea Garden. When Sencha opened, rather than a \"Grand Opening,\" they had a \"Grand *Re*opening,\" which supports my thoughts that it's the same place with different branding (and after a few google searches, they are!) 

The offerings have changed a little bit throughout their evolution, but the quality of the product and general ambience has remained pretty much the same (consistently good!)

The staff has always been friendly, quite knowledgable, and helpful in picking out the right sort of drink when I'm being indecisive. And for the indecisive among us, be warned -- the menu is a *book,* so if you're easily overwhelmed, don't be afraid to ask for recommendations, or just pick from the featured teas on the board.

To add to your decision-making possibilities, they've also got a nice little nook of merchandise that includes cast iron teapots, thermoses, and other tea ware available, as well.

I'm generally there for some variety of boba or jelly tea, and for that, they don't disappoint. You can get it sweet, savory, or more on the bitter side. As a bonus for the dairy-free among us (hi!) their default milk teas are non-dairy-based, though I believe you can ask for dairy-based options as well. The levels of sweetness are also somewhat adjustable, which I appreciate, as milk tea at some purveyors can be a total sugar-bomb.

Their pots of loose-leaf hot tea are also quite good, especially if you plan to hang out for a bit -- they're reasonably-priced to begin with (about $3), and the refills on hot water and sweetener are included as long as you're there. They also come with a couple of complimentary cookies. Your options run the gamut from sencha (obvs), to your blacks, whites, greens, oolongs, and a host of tisanes (herbals.)

As it's on State Street a few blocks from campus, it's usually slammed with students there to study (anyplace with free wifi and copious outlets near campus that allows food and drink will be!) Also, for the students reading this, last time I was in, Sencha was open later than a number of the other coffee shops on State, which made it a great option for later-night studying. Because it's a high-traffic location, it's never exactly *quiet,* but it is what it is.

Overall, whether you're planning to get your drinks to stay or to go, they're one of my preferred places in town for boba and tea, especially downtown."}
{"text":"Love this place, the staff is extremely nice and they use belly. It's not as big as their Minneapolis location but still great."}
{"text":"I can definitely see myself becoming addicted to this place. My summer place here is really close to State so I don't know if its a good thing or a bad thing that I can just roll up to this place whenever I want. 

It's got creamy tea, iced teas, warm teas, blended teas, and a bunch of other types of teas. You can get lychee or tapioca pearls etc. There are so many options!!

So far I have tried the Black Tea Lemonade, Blended Lychee, Iced Royal Tea, and the Iced Chai Tea. All have been really amazing and it's made me really really happy. I can't wait to come back and try Taro because that's my ultimate fave but I'm saving it for another day!

Its a really nice place. Also the first time I tried it I was totally lost and not sure what to order. The staff was nice and helped me pick out a tea. I was happy! Definitely coming back here!"}
{"text":"My go-to place for bubble tea near the UW campus/Capitol area. Both their milk tea (which they call Tea Lattes for people who are more familiar with the term \"milk tea\"...) and fruit teas are very tasty and not too sweet like most other places (looking at you, Kungfu Tea).

I was super hyped that they have bubbles/boba/tapioca, and immediately ordered an \"Iced black tea latte with bubbles\" which is the equivalent of \"milk tea with tapioca\" where I'm from. It tasted just as I expected, though, and I was pleasantly surprised with their prices. They also have a reward system that's fairly easy to use and can get you a few upgrades and stuff for simply showing up and getting a drink.

I really recommend this place as an after-dinner tea place. It's also a nice place to chill in the afternoon! The ambience is great and you'll often find students studying at all times in the day."}
{"text":"This is such a cute tea room on State Street. I saw Sencha pop up on Hooked, so I went in to get an iced  chai with tapioca pearls. The service was lightning fast and very friendly. The chai was pretty tasty and had a little snap to it. The pearls were really fresh tasting and good with the chai flavoring. A really good combo that I would recommend to others. I sat at the window seating and watched the pedestrian traffic on State Street for a while. It was really nice. There were a few others in the cafe that were chatting away and some others that were set up and working on their laptops. A good mix of customers. They have their walls sprinkled with local art for sale. What a fun way to host local artists in our area. There's lots of seating inside and they could accommodate a larger group if needed too. The prices were on par with the Madison area too."}
{"text":"We stopped here after Kung fu was closed and I'm so glad we did.  I was very surprised walking into Sencha and the modern design it has to it. It was very busy but relaxed at the same time and the baristas were awesome! Really friendly, fast, and helpful baristas.  Being my first time they helped a lot with ordering and what flavor combos went well. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, peaceful decor, and herbal smells make this tea shop feel deliciously delightful to be in.

Definitely try some bubble tea. I recommend black tea, taro flavor, with tapioca balls.

They have quite a few other tea choices and they sell their own high quality herbs."}
{"text":"Yelp 100 Challenge 2018 - 3

Sencha Tea Bar is a small tea shop nearby University of Wisconsin, Madison. There is a Kungfu Tea nearby but I prefer to come here instead since I can go to Kungfu Tea anywhere else.

I really like the ambiance at this place. It's a small and yet very cozy place. With cute decorations throughout the shop with sentimental lights by the window, you will love this place as much as I did.

Being a tea fanatic, I decided to go with Lychee flavor with the Green Tea base. I asked to be made less sweet and my drink was perfectly fine for my taste! My Boyfriend got Cantaloupe and his was pretty good too which complemented very well with chewy boba or tapioca balls. On my second visit, I went with Peach with the same Green Tea base, this was tasty also. I think I liked Lychee slightly more. Japanese Matcha Latte was good. It was something I had somewhere else. Nothing too special.

The two guys working at the bar were both friendly and kind! I really enjoyed my stay here with the boyfriend with these great drinks made by them. I would definitely be back whenever I am back in Wisconsin."}
{"text":"As a tea lover, I had bookmarked Sencha long before moving to Madison. I needed to know that my new city would have a tea bar. That is very important info! I was overjoyed when I saw Sencha and being able to actually visit it really made my day.

There are SO MANY teas. Seriously. The girl at the counter gave me the book, and I turned it down -- I can barely make decisions with regular menus, so the huge variety of tea was honestly overwhelming! Instead, I took a look at the 4 teas listed on their daily menu board and chose from that limited list to prevent tea variety overload. There is regular loose leaf tea as well as bubble tea. I chose a peach black tea that sounded amazing, and got a teapot for $3 something. That is quite the bargain!

While the tea was being prepared, I checked out the merchandise, particularly the sale section. There was a perfectly adorable pink and stainless steel teapot that I squealed over. If it's still there next time I go, it's mine! 

The teapot came out with a couple cookies on a cute little tray. I sat at the tea bar and people watched and relaxed. It wasn't exactly quiet, so I'm not sure how great it would be for doing work, but for hanging out it was perfect. Can't wait to try all the teas one at a time!"}
{"text":"Like it a lot :)! Had hot royal tea with bubbles. Super friendly staff and cosy atmosphere. Perfect way to end the chilly rainy weekend."}
{"text":"I'm not an experienced bubble tea drinker, so I won't rate the drinks. The staff is super friendly and the establishment has a very relaxed vibe. Very comfortable. Will certainly visit again and try another tea, as their variety of choices is just huge!"}
{"text":"I've only gotten the Royal Black Milk Tea with tapioca pearls - it's pretty much your standard bubble tea. I loved the taste of the tea. The tapioca pearls were cooked really well.

I was definitely a little disappointed to see that they microwave hot beverages. I used to work at a bubble tea place and that just seems like a faux pas to pre-make drinks and have to microwave it.

I love the variety they have here. The menu isn't so extensive that it is overwhelming (like at KungFu Tea). The servers are extremely patient and very nice."}
{"text":"Sencha satisfies this picky boba lover's craving for things teas and milk teas. To be honest, I much prefer it to its competitor across the street, Kung Fu Tea. Unlike KFT, this Sencha location offers a great, attractive-looking space to work or talk efficiently in without feeling like you have to compete with loud music or a rowdy crowd.

The service is great, and the manager has always been nice and helpful when making suggestions or recommendations. My go-to typically involves wintermelon tea (hot or cold), but so far there hasn't been a drink that I didn't enjoy."}
{"text":"The bubble tea here is amazing. I'm a big fan of the royal black with the fresh tapioca pearls. My wife is also a huge fan of the iced green tea with lychee. The workers are always friendly and the bathrooms are very clean. Really wish we had one in Milwaukee!"}
