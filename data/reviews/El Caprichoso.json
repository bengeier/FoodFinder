{"text":"These are by far the best hot dogs in all of Phoenix! The staff is very easy going and very friendly as well!  Memo is awesome! I would recommend them to anybody!"}
{"text":"Best hotdogs for $3.00 always on point. Cold sodas I recommend this place."}
{"text":"No way would I just pull over for a dog in a 'riskay' part of town...but I am sure I will be finding myself here more often!  It was late, our choices were Mexican or Burgars, but then I remembered that Dave liked this hot dog cart, so I suggested we stop here (he was thrilled). I got the loaded dog (-guac because of the avocado allergy) with a grilled bun. It was awesome. It had everything, beans, tomotoes, ketchup, mustard, sourcream and cheese. I think I may be drooling as I write the review and think about it. I wanted to eat another; but I refrained because I knew it would put me over the edge.  I don't know this chicks hours, but I am sure I will be checking in and eating at this place out more often!"}
{"text":"Never disappointed with their food inexpensive and great tasting, way better than anywhere I've ever go beside this place. I was told they don't accept debit cards by the man that took my order but they do... luckily I had cash on me. I ordered 4 dogs with everything came out in less than 5 minutes."}
{"text":"It was very good, but don't go if your trying to be healthy in any way.  Your talking about bacon wrapped around a hotdog and deep fried!  Add a bunch other toppings and the bun is lightly fried too and you have something amazing!  Please limit your intake."}
{"text":"We've enjoyed Sonoran style dogs for years, in several states in USA and Mexico.  This stand is one of my family's all time faves.   Highly recommended, and we are fussy.  Perfect bun, just slightly toasted, can taste beans but not drowning balance of flavors.   Best of Phoenix.  Authentic -  This is the real deal."}
{"text":"Must try! We just moved to Phoenix from San Diego and this is the best local place we've had! Definitely going back and the best part is that they're open late."}
{"text":"Great Sonoran hotdogs! We go to this place all the time. Never had an issue, even when it's been busy. Flavor is always consistent. Good place to eat."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Hit this place a couple times a week. Very authentic and the staff is very welcoming. Highly recommended late night snack..."}
{"text":"Yummy hot dogs! Don't let the \"shady looking\" location steer you away from the yummy-ness of this food! I usually don't eat hot dogs, but these are the best I've had! Great that they are open late for a to go midnight snack!"}
{"text":"Their Van says it all... Estilo Sonora. Los Mejores Del Valle. Con Tocino Enrollado.  what???  Now I'm from New England, my family landed at Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1630 and the english language has been spoken here since. i 'know' no spanish and probably will learn very little. I have traveled quite a bit around the world where you need to speak a little of the language that you're visiting or living in. Not in Arizona. Here we have translators in our elementary schools that we PAY for in our taxes, everything is printed twice for non-english immigrants. wtf, so I now have to use a translation software to live in the united states? The translations says... \"the capricious one\", \"Sonoran style Hot Dogs\", \"The Better Of The Valley.  With Bacon Rolled Up\"?  I've been stopping here weekend/evenings after the car wash closes and ordering \"2 with everything\" or \"dos con todo\" and a bottle of coke (mexican, the one with real sugar and not high fructose corn syrup) for several months now and I will be returning again and again. For the \"With Bacon Rolled Up\" part, I have no knowledge of what that could be, but for street meat, it's a great stop. $3.00 per dog. Just across from Maverick Saloon on 19th near Hatcher in Francis & Sons Car Wash parking lot (next to Sonic).  Last night is the first night that they actually had someone who spoke english to take my order, for the owner and the majority of her patrons speak very little to none at all. But money talks and I'm fine with that. I've been frequenting this haunt for quite awhile, and last night I got to ask some questions. The dogs are great, and it's a nice clean set-up, and I JUST found out you have your choice of having the bun toasted or steamed. For me the steamed bun is the way to go, seems like back home New Haven street vendor, but mexican. Cool.  I love mexican food, I love being in the southwest, I love these hot dogs stands that I stumble across in my travels (and I stop at many of these just to find the best). PSSST, hey it's this one! I found it. They do one thing, and they do it well, That's why I return time and again. Even with the language barrier and that they put mayonnaise on their everythingdogs... yes mayonnaise?!!  I just want you to know, know that for a finicky culinary searcher, you'll need to stop by and yelp in too.  El Caprichoso Hot Dogs - \"Characterized by or subject to whim; impulsive and unpredictable\" also is available for catering and private events. Hopefully they'll supply their own translator."}
{"text":"First off, you have to be an adventurous type to trek out close to midnight and find these Sonoran dogs.  This location feels like the middle of somewhere not safe, but once I was there, there were quite a few customers and there was a consistent stream of customers.  The good thing about this place is that it's a food truck so you get your hot dog freshly cooked and if hot dogs aren't your thing, the menu is pretty extensive and covers other Mexican fare.  The hot dogs are yummy, the bread soft and fluffy, and the condiments are provided ala cooler.  Plus they have TV service... on this night I watched the Latin Billboard awards.  You too, my friends can check out TeleMundo while you enjoy your comida.    Don't let the location discourage you, it's worth the adventure... but I think I'll bring a friend next time instead of going by myself,"}
{"text":"$3.00 each. Open till 2AM. If you're from a major city I don't need to say any more about \"hole in the walls\" or street vendors making the best food. You get it, you understand. Go here. Get one. Actually, get two. Grab a beer from QT on the corner, go home, and grub. You're welcome.   To the three reviewers who sent me here: Thank you :)   To the woman and man running this establishment: bless your hearts. You give NYC and Chicago hot dogs a run for their money!"}
{"text":"Amazing Sonoran hot dogs. Hot dogs are cooked on a flat top after being wrapped in bacon. They are covered in beans with crema, guac and onions. But the bun is the BEST...so soft and spongy! Like no hot dog you've ever had!!!"}
{"text":"Read the reviews from yelp, drive by this place all the time, but I always had skepticism about street vendors from prior experiences. Short story, wow. This is some good food.   There's so much going on, but it all equals a great hot dog. At 3 bucks a pop there's not reason to not stop by and grab at least one to give it a shot."}
{"text":"On point every time. I'd been here a few times. Check it out. Cheap, and the dogs are good for a craving. One time at a family birthday party, they rolled up and provided yummy hot dogs for everyone. I was like, I KNOW the Caprichoso! yum. They catered the party, my tio had the connection."}
{"text":"Bangin' Sonoran dogs for only $3!  Bacon wrapped wieners and steamed buns don't get much classier than this."}
{"text":"If you know sonoran dogs,  you know you have to get two things right...the bun,  and the bacon.  Check and check! This place has the best steamed, then grilled buns.  The bacon is actually crispy and crunches when you bite it.  The usual Sonoran dog toppings are present,  with a little queso cotija sprinkled on top, but this dog is special.  Just go try it for yourself."}
{"text":"My favorite! I actually got someone addicted to them  he had never heard of them before. I highly recommend trying this place! At least try it once  the customer service is great as well, they are always sweet and prompt."}
{"text":"Honest! The best hot dogs I've ever had here in Phoenix. The bread taste like no other hot dog bun I've ever had. The sausage and condiments put on the hotdog all come together to make you feel like you got fireworks in your mouth.  The staff is really nice and welcoming.  Will for sure comeback!"}
{"text":"Best Sonoran Dogs in Phoenix.  I found out about Sonoran dogs 10 years ago, and get them occasionally as a treat, and these are really good.  The flavors were distinct and plentiful.  I will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Living in the area this might not feel like the best of locations. The reviews don't lie, the sonoran dogs are excellent and for being out doors with a pop up tent and a handful of tables and chairs everything was kept quite clean. Only thing to note is that the cart is cash only but at three bucks a dog you can probably scrounge the floor of your car in a pinch."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for a Sonoran dog, El Caprichoso is clearly one of your better options. At the time of this review, they have five locations, although only two actually have Yelp pages. This particular cart is currently operating in a car wash parking lot near 19th and Dunlap.   It's not much to look at, nor is this area in general. But rest assured, the hot dogs they serve here really impress! Which is a good thing, because that's pretty much the only thing they serve.  Since no side options were available, I ordered a couple of loaded dogs. The ingredients and the dog itself were both on point, while the toasted bun only enhances the overall enjoyment. Wash them down with a Mexican Coke and that's pretty much all you need.   On a side note: Their Yelp hours are posted with a 6pm opening, although they weren't up and operating until closer to 7pm when we stopped by.  No gimmicks and no frills. Just straight-up excellent Sonoran dogs - and despite being a small business, they're not too stingy to enforce a \"cash only\" policy. They do charge 50 cents for cards, but that's better than having to run to the nearest ATM.   Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Amazing first experience!! The ladies had great service and I'll definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"OMG!!!  This place is the best!!!  I love hot dogs, but usually I will only eat them with the most general toppings... ketchup, mustard, relish... but this place just BLEW MY MIND!  For $3 you get a hot dog wrapped in bacon in a bun with beans, tomatoes, cheese, mayo, guac, onions, ketchup, and mustard.  I decided to go for the almost all but the mayo and onions and it was so effin delicious!!!   PROS:  The hot dog bun is TO DIE FOR!!!  The crispy bacon wrapped around the hot dog is perfection... the whole gosh darn thing is too delicious to put into words.  Go get one!!!   CONS:  Cash only, it's in a car wash parking lot..."}
{"text":"Huge fan! If you know anything about Sonoran style hot dogs... you know that the bun and the bacon wrapped weenie are KEY. The man behind the grill generously loads the dog with everything from beans, avocado, cheese, chilis, onions, ketchup, and whatever else your heart desires. go for the \"lleno con todo\" (filled with everything) you wont regret your choice. And at $3 bucks a piece, dude, get 2!"}
{"text":"Oh so so good! Rarely do I not see anyone there ordering food. Affordable, friendly and fast! What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"I was on my way home from the Cardinals vs Diamondbacks game, and I was a little bit famished.  I didn't want any fast food, and I also didn't want to go to a diner type place.  I had remembered my friend Liza had written a review of this spot, and I have also had it bookmarked for awhile now.  I figured, now is the time, right?  I decided to head up the 17 North and exit on Dunlap.  Drove down a few blocks, made a left on 19th and this place is about a mile down 19th Ave. on the left.  It's in a U-Haul parking lot. Pretty non descript, but you will find it without a problem if you keep your eye out.  I pulled in the parking lot, approached the cart/dining area and was asked if it was for here, or to go?  I said for here, and the nice young gentlemen told me to grab a seat and that he would be over in a minute.  I decided to go with 2 Sonoran Hot Dogs (no mayo) and a Mandarin Jarritos.  A few minutes later, my dogs were placed in front of me.  Here is how they were...........  Sonoran Hot Dogs-  Right when they were placed down in front of me, I knew they were going to be awesome!  Just on visual appeal alone, these warrant 5 stars!  I noticed that the bun was grilled and had a nice toasty, buttery sheen to it.  The top part of the bun reminded me of a New England split style hot dog bun.  It sure was beautiful.  I took a bite into my dogs and was overwhelmed with joy!  This dog was wrapped with bacon, then topped with ketchup, mustard, avocado sauce?, jalapeno sauce, beans, tomatoes and some cotija cheese sprinkled on top.  Everything just works!  I am not a big fan of pinto beans.  I am not a fan of ketchup on my hot dog...its almost sac religious!  I am not a fan of cheap hot dogs.  I am not the biggest fan of tomatoes.  You know what though?  This hot dog consists of ALL of those ingredients that I normally don't like, but it still tastes like a million bucks!  Something about the combo of flavors makes it work perfectly!  I'm pretty sure that bun is the key!  It is toasty and a bit crunchy, yet pillow soft when you bite in, and deep enough to hold everything in without shit falling out all over the place.  It's a perfect vehicle for this type of dog.  I woofed down my 2 dogs and easily could have gone for another....maybe 2!  These were not only the best Sonoran style dogs I have ever had, these dogs were some of the best \"any kind of dogs\" I have ever had.  They were awesome.  I almost don't want to try out any other Sonoran dog places in Phoenix because I am afraid I will be let down due to how perfect these were.  Jarritos-  Mandarin Jarritos.  Bomb!  You have to have an OG Mexican Coke or a Jarritos while eating food like this.  Overall, it was $3.00 a dog, and $2.00 for the soda.  $8.00 total for one of the best meals I have had in Phoenix!  They are open late, the guy running the place was friendly, and the dogs were flat out awesome!  Good find, Liza...good find!  I now have a Sonoran dog spot I can recommend, take out of town visitors to, and keep coming back to myself!  Damn, those dogs were good!"}
{"text":"These are some really good Mexican hot dogs. I have only been here once but I got to have more."}
