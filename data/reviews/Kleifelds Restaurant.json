{"text":"This was my first time eating at Kleifelds. It was recommended by family that lives in the area. I had the breakfast special (eggs over easy, home fries with green peppers and onions, and toast). The food was very good and given how busy it was (a packed house) the ONE waitress serving everyone did an excellent job. I would definitely recommend this to family and friends who want a great breakfast and an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"We have been coming in for years and we absolutely love this place. We have been coming in atleast once a week since the new owner has taken over. It has never been busier. Always people waiting when we go in. Love the new little changes she has done with the place. It has definitely lightened up the atmosphere. Extremely clean and one of our favorite places. Great service and great food. The new owner is doing something right. Keep up the good work!!"}
{"text":"The food was nothing special, average if anything. The homefries were more like mashed potatoes. Food came out quickly. Service was top notch. Coffee cup was always full. Very small quaint diner. Cash only."}
{"text":"Just stood at the entrance for 10 minutes and no one even helped us. Not from around here and traveled bc of the reviews. It was extremely rude the waitresses kept looking at us and ignoring us. Another couple walked in and they did they same thing. My family and the couple walked out."}
{"text":"This place could be a gem but is lacking good service and consistency.  The homefries are hit or miss. They are either undercooked or burnt to a crisp, is it really that hard to cook them correctly?     The waitress today handed me the bill and I knew it was incorrect.  I go to this place 2 times a week and get the same the thing so I know what I should pay.  When I told her it should be $7.53 unless they increased the prices she said the bill was right. Finally after going back and forth she figured out she over charged me.    Lastly, I was hoping with the kitchen upgrades that the ventilation system would be upgraded.  I hate smelling like grease and having to change when I leave there."}
{"text":"Favorite diner to go to in the area,great  atmosphere inside,the staff is great and makes for a nice experience everytime I'm there. Try what they have on  special,always creative and tasty. A must stop place to visit and enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"I grew up in the Mentor area and for years whenever visting DTW was greeted by a big Kleifelds sign on a brick wall.  When I moved back to the area I was like, I've gotta try this place. So alright, one day after pressing my boyfriend to go - we did.  We have gone almost every week since that point months ago. My boyfriend always gets the french toast and I change it up from time to time but usually always order a breakfast item. The food, is not only delicious, but it's quick and inexpensive. Which allows us to tip over the usual 20%. The ladies deserve it.  The servers are wonderful, they know their customers and treat them like friends and family.  I warn every first timer who comes here: once you have breakfast at Kleifelds no other breakfast restaurant is going to compare."}
{"text":"Awesome diner! Get there early as it gets filled up quick. It's a small place. Just super solid and consistent. Downtown Willoughby makes for a great small town feel. Probably my favorite diner on the east side."}
{"text":"Very quick and friendly service, and delicious food and coffee as well (at an affordable diner-like price)!"}
{"text":"I sat at the small counter with a packed house at 10:30 AM on Sunday morning.  Within five minutes of my order I had my food sitting in front of me.  The staff was very nice and courteous and the food was hot and did not disappoint.  The prices were very inexpensive for the impressive amount of food that i received.  Keep up the great work!!  I love your food and the quaint atmosphere of an old-school diner.  For the type of restaurant this is and the great prices of the food this is definitely a five star breakfast joint.  Nothing fancy just great food for a good price."}
{"text":"We stopped at Kleifeld's on our way from Cleveland to Niagra Falls.  Our son wanted breakfast, and the rest of our family was ready for lunch.  We chose Kleifeld's strictly on Yelp reviews.  It was a quaint diner with excellent food and wonderful, personable service.  Our girl's had the Monte Christo sandwich and give a hearty thumbs up.  Our son had pancakes, hard to go wrong there.  My husband had the Gyro Omelet which came with breakfast potaoes.  I had the Reuben sandwich combo which came with cole slaw and home fries.  Our food was super fresh and hot, and even better than expected.  We were all well satisfied.  We met the new owner (as of March 2015).  She was very friendly and obviously takes her food seriously.   If we ever find ourswlves in Willoughby, OH again, we will definitely be stopping at Kleifeld's!  P.S. They now accept credit cards."}
{"text":"Kleifelds Restaurant has been scientifically proven to cure hangovers."}
{"text":"This is a quaint little restaurant with old diner feel. I had a club sandwich that was amazing and huge. Fair like fries. My server Sonya was very friendly and knowledgeable for only her second day!!! Even other guests were talking to other tables definitely a must try."}
{"text":"Classic greasy spoon, old school diner.  You have a handfull of tables as well as about 10-15 stools at the counter.  The prices are very reasonable, the food is quick and good.  Everything about this place seems standard and solid.   I had a meeting there for breakfast and we both got the corned beef hash.  It was really good!  Coffee was fine and the service was fast and friendly.  I will definitely be going back!  It is CASH ONLY so just a heads up to stop at the ATM if you don't normally carry cash."}
{"text":"Traveling on 90 with three kids.  Was headed to Bob Evans and was very happy I looked for a better non-chain option on Yelp.  Seating is limited but food was great and quick.  We were there for breakfast, kids and husband all happy.  Family of 5 was 29 and cash only.  Will stop again on our next trek across ohio.  I had a Mediterranean Omelette special and my husband had the chicken fried steak-both were great.  Pancakes were fresh and huge."}
{"text":"A group of four of us went to Kleifeld's this morning around 9:30 am for breakfast. It's a Sunday, so though we knew they would be busy, we were hoping we had beaten the crowds. I have been there once or twice before over the past several years, and I've always enjoyed the quaint, retro decor and yesteryear feeling. As our luck would have it, every seat was already taken. During our entire wait of almost 15 minutes, we were disappointed that neither of the two visible employees (waitresses) seemed to notice us standing at the front of the restaurant. (It is a tiny little place with very little room to move about, so we would have been hard to miss with everyone else being seated). Neither of the waitresses greeted or even made eye contact with us. When a table finally did open up, no one directed us to sit down; we decided to seat ourselves at a newly-vacated table though nothing had been cleaned from it yet. The elderly waitress soon came, cleared the plates and wiped the table off. She was very friendly but obviously overworked. After placing our orders, which consisted of basic omelettes and pancakes, tables began to open up and new patrons were seated around us. Our elderly waitress did her best to keep up with the constant high-level of activity. She was the only server for the people sitting at the tables. (There couldn't have been more than eight tables in the whole restaurant; there are also around 10 old-fashioned stools at the counter that were handled by another waitress). Our waitress seemed to be running back-and-forth replenishing coffee, taking orders, and delivering meals... to everyone except for us. I have never had such slow service there in the past. We began to wonder if she forgot to place our order, as people who were seated well after us had already received their meals and were almost finished eating. We were hoping to get her attention, but she never seemed to make her way back toward us (we were sitting near the front door area) but stayed busy at the back. Finally our meals came about 45 minutes after we first sat down. The younger waitress, who primarily manned the patrons sitting at the counter, helped the older waitress carry the food out and served us. We were given no explanations or apologies for why our breakfasts had taken so long, and we were so famished by the time our food arrived that we all immediately dug in. Our food was tasty, but it was basic breakfast fare and nothing too fancy. One of my friends commented that the coffee was pretty good. As others have shared in the comment section, the prices can't be beat. Our breakfast for four was under $30. All in all, I was disappointed that the service was so slow. Kleifeld's would do well to hire a busboy or someone  - at least on their busy days  - to at least clear and wipe the tables, set out the new silverware and perhaps re-fill the coffee cups once in awhile to help speed things up. I might be back sometime in the future, but it probably will not be my first choice if I am entertaining friends."}
{"text":"Probably the best breakfast food I have ever had! My husband and I were very impressed and loved the environment. We honestly are still dreaming and drooling about eating more of their food but unfortunately we are from out of town. Definitely will visit again when we come back!"}
{"text":"A good friend of mine and I went here for breakfast this morning. We've both lived in the Willoughby area our entire lives but this was our first visit!   Both of the servers working were so kind and attentive. When we told them it was our first visit, they told us the history of the building and even played us a song on the jukebox.   The food was absolutely delicious. I had chocolate chip pancakes (so fluffy & huge!) and the best home fries I've ever tasted. My friend had a veggie omelette which she also loved!   We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Small diner that was busy for breakfast on Sunday morning (St. Paddy's Day). We shared our large table with a very nice couple. Italian sausage omelet was good. Home fries on the bland side and undercooked. If I stop in again, I'll ask for them crispy. Prices are great!"}
{"text":"First time I have stopped in and live in the area. The inside looks to be your typical diner, seats at a longer bar and individual tables. Not a huge place at all.  Menu was typical for a diner - breakfast and some lunch specials. Everything was reasonably priced and on the cheaper side for the area. We both had country friend steak which we both thought was cooked well and delicious. Eggs and toast were cooked fine.   Nothing crazy but a cute diner and better alternative than a chain like bob Evans! Our waitress was attentive and kind- we didn't have to wait on a Sunday morning but I know sometimes it is more crowded ."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast....the food, coffee, portions, service, and old school diner feel are all great. It's exactly why you go to a diner for breakfast. My ONLY suggestion is to get Smuckers Jelly...because my lovely wife is picky about her jams and jellies....haha"}
{"text":"Amazing.  I went to this place as a child growing up in Willoughby, and my father went there as a child too.  On a whim I just looked into some Wiloughby history and read that the diner opened up in 1887 at that location!  Holy crap.  That is definately \"a while\".  I don't know how true it is but it's in all of the old pics I can find of Willoughby."}
{"text":"Yummy breakfast at a reasonable price.  It's a limited dining space, so you are lucky if you get a table.  We had to wait a bit to get served, but once we got our server, she was extremely attentive.  The fellow patrons all seemed happy as well.  Large portions served for breakfast, including the extremely large pancake for our youngster, which was tasty!  Coffee was tasty as well."}
{"text":"Randomly pulled off the road cause we were hungry and so happy to have found this place.  It felt like a modern retro place and the food was delish.  This'll be a new stop off place when I'm back in the area again."}
{"text":"This place is super cute. It is exactly what you picture when you hear the word diner. There's a couple tables and a row of bar stools. My friend and I went there on a Sunday for brunch around 12:30pm. It was crowded with only two seats left at the bar. So, we took those. The staff is super friendly and the food is great! It is pretty fast service as well. The town it's in is really cute too. We walked around a little afterwards which was nice. I'd recommend coming here for a relaxing brunch and stroll!"}
{"text":"We were passing through town and this restaurant had good reviews on Yelp so we decided to try it.  Prices can't be beat and the food was really good.  If you're looking for a no frills place that does the basic breakfast well, eat here!  It is a cash only restaurant."}
{"text":"Delightful food and people. We ordered omelets, house special, and burger. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I love downtown Willoughby and this place is been in downtown Willoughby since the beginning of time. It's got an old fashioned bar you can sit up at and order your meal or find one of the tables and Order their. It also has these really cool jukeboxes which actually still work they play old school music as well now the new crap on the radio. As with any old school egg place you can order eggs around the clock but this place isn't open around the clock. They're pretty much open through late lunch and then they closed down for the rest of the day but they are open early. There's a huge mural painted on the side of the building that housed their coffee and it says always good coffee. It was pretty much exactly that. Good. Miami it was okay I had one of those specials it was a chicken wrap of some sort but I kind of wish I would have got breakfast like my buddy he said it was 10 Stars awesome. Mine was just so so not that I won't go back though"}
{"text":"Such a cute little diner! We stopped here on our way home from Cleveland! The staff was very nice and helpful. Great prices, great food!!"}
{"text":"This is a Willoughby classic. It's been around awhile (much longer than me) and my Dad likes to tell stories about going there when he was growing up. They have lot of regulars that come in. I'm currently working on my 'regular status' for the summer :)  Definitely go for breakfast or brunch. It's a tiny place and not ideal for big groups (try four or less).  I just had the French toast today and was reminded how delicious it is.  Menu is super cheap/affordable too. Don't forget it's cash only.  If you're from the area and haven't been, I highly recommend."}
{"text":"My wife was running in a local marathon so I had about four hours to kill.  Thanks to the internet, I was told that the best breakfast in the area could be found at Kleifeld's.  \"Disappointed\" is the very last word I would use to describe my experience.  The atmosphere is very warm and welcoming.  It's a throwback to the old mom and pop diners that you can still find tucked away in the nooks and crannies of America.  The staff was very friendly and accommodating.  I had some great conversation with local regulars as well.  There's not a lot of room in there, but if you can get in, it's worth it.  Every single item on the menu was appealing as well as the specials that were listed for the day.  I chose the Western Omelette.  It arrived picture-perfect with my home fries and wheat toast.  The omelette was cooked very well with the right amount of cheese and the veggies were nicely al dente.  The potatoes were fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside.  Very nice.  The toast was toast.  Nothing more, nothing less, but certainly nothing to complain about either.  Keeping large squeeze bottles of hot sauce alongside the ketchup and mustard was also a very nice and appreciated touch.  The prices were beyond reasonable for what I had.  I would definitely return to this place if the planets were to align properly once again."}
{"text":"Great and fast service and extremely affordable. You pay for what you get. Nothing flashy at a very affordable price. The waitress for the bar seats was great. They do take credit cards"}
{"text":"The prices and food are good. However, the service and the consistency of quality here is lacking. I've only visited on the weekends, but  I have been many, many times. There are only 2 servers working, which gets very hectic for the amount of people in a small space. This is a nice diner- type place to reminisce, but don't have your expectations set too high. The food has always tasted good and you can't beat the price, but some days are better quality than others, I would say depending on who is in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Nice little mom and pop shop for breakfast.  It is small but has a home like feel and fast service."}
{"text":"As far as diners go, Kleifelds is as Old School as you can go. This is a no-nonsense, busy diner, not a new restaurant trying to go retro. My dad used to eat here 30yrs ago and it hasn't changed much.   Their omelets are tasty and hash browns are excellent. I especially like the quick service and GREAT prices!! A cup of coffee: $1.50. The most expensive omelet on the menu: $5.49.   Check 'em out while in Willoughby!"}
{"text":"Best greasy spoon breakfast spot in the area. French toast and extra crispy hash browns til I die."}
{"text":"Yummy, inexpensive breakfast food and friendly staff. The five star rating is for their chicken paprikash. Amazing... just like home when I'm feeling lazy and don't feel like cooking. Yum"}
{"text":"We stopped in this place looking for a good local breakfast. We were not disappointed! I ordered the Kielbasa and eggs breakfast, and my mom ordered the corned beef hash and eggs. The Kielbasa was phenomenal and we both agreed that the eggs were excellent. One small complaint would be the hash- my mom didn't like the onions in it. What a great little place!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place. Fast service. Always busy on Saturday morning when we go to the Farmer's Market. The hash brown is really good. Great overall breakfast. I alway order omelet when I go there."}
{"text":"Good, home-cooked breakfast reasonably priced. Coffee wasn't Dunkin' but doable. Perfectly cooked eggs made me overlook warm tomato juice."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just happened to come across this place.  We were looking for new ideas for breakfast on a Sunday a few weeks ago.  I searched on Yelp for any recommendations, and came across this place.  As many times as we've been through Downtown Willoughby, we never knew this place existed.  I'm glad we decided to try this place!  All my boyfriend talks about now is this place.  We haven't had a chance to go back, because we've been so busy... but we plan on soon!  Wish the place was a bit bigger, especially since you may have to wait a bit to be seated.  We lucked out, because there was 2 seats available at the bar.  There aren't more than a couple of tables.  We placed our order and food came quickly.  I'm only giving 4 stars, because of the lack of service.  I understand the place was busy and all the tables were filled, but there were 2 waitresses, and then someone came from the kitchen and was helping.  I waited and waited for my coffee to be refilled, and even placed it on the edge, so they would know.  Nope, kept walking by and trying to get their attention and ignored us.  Great food, Great prices and you definitely get your money's worth with the amount of food they give you, but they lack on customer service.  Overall, I know we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Just stepped off a red eye on our way to Geneva, yelp led us here. Small old school diner with jukeboxes on counter.  Ahhh..childhood memories.  Ordered two eggs scrambled, bacon, white toast and home fries. Food was pretty much average,  nothing spectacular.  OJ and syrup are store bought brands.    Service was friendly. Prices are cheap or maybe that's because I am from California and we can't get breakfast for two for $12.81."}
{"text":"I love diner's, this one was ok.  The wait was a while which don't mind, but not sure it was worth it.  First off the air condition is leaking at the entrance so when you enter water drips on customers..... I'm sure it's an easy fix? no?  Kinds gross. Then when your standing in the small entrance no one greets you, basically the customers are discussing where everyone is going to sit.  The waitress was ok as well.  She seemed busy so didn't want to bother her to much but anything we asked for she seemed puzzled, probably just overwhelmed cause small place, but it was packed.  The food came out and it was ok.  Omelette was over cooked.  The one pancake my sister ordered seemed old. My order was good but she didn't eat hers.  The prices weren't considered \"cheap\" so I wasn't really happy with experience. Wish them the best tho."}
{"text":"Classic small-town cafe breakfast. We both had omelets -- Italian sausage for one, a Mediterranean special for the other (spinach, feta, onions). Both came with home fries and toast.  I would quibble a little about the Mediterranean -- the chopped onions could have been cut back, for example. But everything was tasty. The service was prompt, efficient and friendly. Got there a little before noon on a Sunday and had only a short wait for a table, and there were several seats open at the counter."}
{"text":"I not much of a egg person, but the eggs I hate this morning were the best! I ate all of them and I usually don't do that! The price of my meal is under $6 with coffee. The home fries are really good and chuck too."}
{"text":"I go here multiple times a week and I'm never disappointed. Great food and great people. I love it here."}
{"text":"Totally agree with the most recent review.  We have been coming here for years, and was disappointed to find the owners had changed.  Inside is starting to have changes made, which are taking away from the quaint, old fashioned environment that was a throw back to simpler times.    Each time we have visited recently, the always packed little restaurant seems to have less and less patrons.  The paying guest always votes with their pocket book, so pay attention new owners......"}
{"text":"I came here a few weeks ago to check it out with my sister. The service was VERY SPEEDY, my order was accurate, but the food was average. Nothing earth shattering but I suppose if you're not accustom to larger city expectations, then you'll be okay.   The place is really quaint, cute and you can definitely tell there's history here which I appreciate. There are some typical bar diner stools/countertop scenarios and some tables. The place is small but everyone was very friendly, attentive and nice.   They DO take credit cards so that's a plus. Either way, I'm glad I went to experience it. The only reason for the three stars is the food was kind of bland/lacking flavor."}
{"text":"This place has so much history. It's been operating since the 20's and I bet I'm sitting in the same seats as my grandparents did. This is my \"go to\" breakfast place on the weekends for many reasons.  1. The ambiance of downtown Willoughby can't be beat. I love to window shop here.  2. The food is cheap and really good.  I usually order the special which includes eggs, bacon, sausage, homefries, and toast.  I think it's 5 or 6 bucks.    3. The staff is friendly and attentive.  I never have to ask for more coffee or extra napkins.  They take care of you and you feel welcomed and appreciated.  Don't worry if there is a line of people waiting for seats.  Seats open up quickly."}
{"text":"Had Corned Beef on rye...gf had banana nut pancakes....great homestyle food for the price!"}
