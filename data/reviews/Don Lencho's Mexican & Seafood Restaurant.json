{"text":"Went to Don Lencho's last night with husband, and I must say I was not impressed. First we walk in and we were not greeted by the person who is operating the register, I assume it was  the owner. We then were greeted by a waitress she sat us, took a while before she offered drinks, their salsa is pretty much watered down and it tastes bad, in would of much rather have canned or tapatio than theirs. She brought our food we had no silver ware we asked twice for it while our food was already in our table. I had to ask for a refill and what they were out we had to wait for it, really it's understandable but please be prepared. We then proceeded to pay the lady did not say a word yeah not a good way to make business heck she did not even thank us. And. It to forget how uncomfortable she made me feel. right above where I was sitting was a tv she was staring at it constantly. I ordered fajitas and they were defenetly not what I was expecting. Needles to say we won't be back."}
{"text":"Usually I'm not dissatisfied with this place. But I ate here Saturday night and 2 large parties came in after us. We ordered our food Arroz Marinero and a carne asada quesadilla. The quesadilla lacked cheese it was pretty pathetic and tasteless. The Arroz Marinero was excellent like always. Our appetizer was queso fundido with chorizo it was cold and stringy. They servers spent most of their time catering to the large groups and after we got our food didn't return to the table to see how everything was or to see if we needed anything.  We had to go to the front cashier for our check.  I think its sad that they didn't treat all their tables with priority.  I will never return again."}
{"text":"I just wanted to say I have been going here for 7 yrs they remember you the Costa Bravo soup is amazing!! They are so nice!! I literally crave and look forward to planning when I can visit. I find myself after a long stretch at work talking to co workers telling them tomorrow I am having my soup and relaxing! Love live love this place authentic good and welcoming always:)"}
{"text":"OMG This is our family spot.  After a long days work it is so nice to walk through their doors and be greeted and treated like family. The food is so fresh and the staff is so friendly It takes the guilt away from me not cooking. Fast friendly service every time and priced just right."}
{"text":"Was a little annoyed at how long it took for our food to come out, we get our food and was completely satisfied with how fresh and delicious our food was."}
{"text":"This place is always clean when I come in. There aren't usually many customers, but the atmosphere is so pleasant that I keep coming back sometimes just to be in the building. It has a very authentic feel on the inside. Nice dark green carpeting, clean red leather seats and pleasant music. Chips and salsa are promptly served and your drink comes quickly (and I'm weird about the taste of water, so trust me when I say the water here tastes great!). The servers are always very nice and they don't make a lot of small talk (huge plus if you're like me) so they take your order and take it right in. The seats are comfortable and the decor is relaxing, with two TVs to watch. Food comes out in literally about 6-8 minutes. I SWEAR ON MY LIFE this place had the BEST Carne Asada Burrito I have EVER eaten. The meat isn't over-salted, the guac inside doesn't take up a lot of room but it tastes so refreshing. The Pico De Gallo served on the side tastes incredibly fresh and the fact that I eat it and enjoy it is a testament to Don Lencho's because I actually hate tomatoes. I also hate sour cream but I eat it here because its so light and delicate tasting. The lettuce served on the plate looks and tastes freshly chopped. I don't think anything I've eaten here wasn't made here. My plate is always clean at the end. (I also usually order their Mexican rice to accompany my taste buds while I visit burrito-land) I can't believe what a gem this restaurant is and I will always come here when I want Carne Asada. Its so fairly priced. I literally pay about $6.50 for their Carne Asada burrito and the side of rice is $2.50 so my bill always comes out under $10. I tip them well every time as a result. If you haven't been here yet, you should visit. (Seriously I went on a cruise vacation down the southwest side of Mexico and NO place had a burrito this good!!!)"}
{"text":"Outstanding... glad I trusted the reviews and tried it out.. I had queso fundido with chorizo which was really good. Then had the shrimp burrito enchilada style and it was outstanding."}
{"text":"Read other Yelp reviews, thought we would give it a shot. Seating was speedy, order came out quick ... and then ... the hair! Mind you, this wasn't some innocent looking hair in my wife's entree, rather it was a grotesque 16 inch black thread of vile sinew. When I plucked it out from her dish, just as the waiter was walking over to our table, the strand decided to ornate itself with rice grains; similar to a beaded necklace. Waiter watched me pull it out, said nothing and plopped some salsa on the table as he turned and walked away. Ooh, did I mention the salsa wasn't half bad?"}
{"text":"Went in today for lunch, it was my first visit. Not too much to the exterior or interior, but they had the requisite lunch special menu items (tacos, tostada, mini chimi, etc...) from 4.99 to 5.99. I went with the chicken chimi and it was fresh and tasty. Good chips and verde salsa. I found the red too hot however.  I also found their refried beans to be darker and better tasting than other places, and they didn't seem to have as much lard in them.  Will try their shrimp cervix he next time for 10 bucks.  I dinged 1 star cuz I asked for a lemon or lime wedge (whichever they had the most of) in my ice water and they missed it both times. Good value."}
{"text":"This place is good depending on what you get. Kind of hit and miss. I had a Carne aside burrito I didn't like. The lunch special is a good deal. The beans are really good. Fried fish is really good."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in here the other day because we wanted some real Mexican food (we work in a Tex-Mex chain mexican restaurant) and we were pleasantly surprised! The food was amazing! I had the shrimp enchiladas and they were to die for! Big portions too! Small building but we had quick service and were very happy when we left. We will be returning!"}
{"text":"Very nice and clean, pleasant greetings Tuesday special = mini tostado 1.99                                    Buy one get one beer  It can be any beer (how cool is that!)  Free chips and salsa (second order 1.59)"}
{"text":"We have been here a long time ago, we were feeling nostalgic so stopped in for lunch. Mistake. My mom and I shared this fish fillet dish. We assumed it was either cod or tilapia... you know what they say about assuming...  I took one bite of this fish and it literally tasted like dirt. it was horrible. we asked the server what kind of fish it was we figured cat fish.  She assured us it was a \"cleaner\" tasting fish called a Basa.... ah well I tasted dirt so im not sure what \"cleaner\" means.  After looking this fish up, it is a cat fish. not just any cat fish! oh no, this Basa fish has been banned in THREE states! It is farmed in Vietnam, packed frozen and shipped in USA. This fish is a discount product.  I will never be going back here again and utterly disappointed on the quality of food"}
{"text":"Good food, great carnitas, good service, friendly staff."}
{"text":"This is definitely a local favorite of mine! The staff is wonderful and the food is great and authentic (the burritos, enchiladas, and ceviche are my usuals)! This place really makes me nostalgic to all the local Mexican places back in Los Angeles. I recommend the ceviche- it's some of the best I've ever had (no le digas a mi ma..)!"}
{"text":"Went to Don Lenchos for dinner and had the shrimp enchiladas, my husband had the garlic shrimp with beans and rice and  my daughter had the shrimp ceviche tostada.  The food was very good.  We will be coming back for sure and try the menudo"}
{"text":"okay i have no idea whats with the bad reviews?!  i've been going here for yearssssss!!!! my food has always been incredible; the chips and salsa have always been amazing! and the service is fantastic! jus sayin"}
{"text":"Soooo gross, the service was horrible, they never checked on us. The salsa tasted cheap. All of the food came out cold. I would never recommend this place to anyone. We saw good reviews on here and thought we would give it a try but it was just a huge let down. It was just a waste of time and money. Do not come here."}
{"text":"Best shrimp cocktail in the valley, loaded with the very thing we asked for SHRIMP!!! and of course avocados, friendly staff, small yet cozy intimate setting!!"}
{"text":"This place is a dive, the interior & exterior is dying for an update, it's surrounded by an eyesore of buildings... But I'm here for the food though! The food is legit, don't let everything else fool u. I'm Mexican, my mom is a caterer & I love exploring in different eateries. If u want good food, great prices & love alcohol this is the place!  Ambiance- 2 Food quality - 5 Food presentation - 3 Pricing - 4 Location - 2 Service - 5  My review is solely on the good food & service & nothing else. If u r looking for ambiance & something fancy this is not the place."}
{"text":"We've been here 2x now! Really great authentic food! The ladies here are very friendly and attentive! Great small authentic Mexican restaurant that I will keep coming back to!"}
{"text":"Tiny Mexican joint in old town Peoria.  Don Lenchos is a dive that is a solid 3.  I've been to Don Lenchos several times and am willing to go back several more.  The ceviche is pretty good as is the shrimp cocktails.  It is a little over limey but it still tastes pretty fresh and delicious for a seafood meal in the middle of Peoria AZ.  The breakfast here is just okay.  I recommend sticking to the shrimp/ceviche.  They also have a good selection of Mexican beer which is surprisingly hard to find sometimes.  The price is fair.  Not as cheap as it should be but not exactly an arm and a leg either."}
{"text":"First the service was good. The place was clean and they had Pacifico beer. But my dinner was the most bland Mexican food I ever tasted!! The beans were like no flavor at all. The beef enchiladas were ok consistency but no heat, no south of the boarder  flavor. Just a lot of cheese covered tasteless kinda Taco Bell style food."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here a handful of times. Neat little family owned restraunt in downtown Peoria. The food is really good. Authentic mexican food. Big portions. I absolutely love the shrimp burrito, enchilada style with the white sauce. I highly recommend it. The margaritas are quite small, and the service is sometimes lacking. Not rude service, just slow, and we have been forgotten for refills before etc. That is why it gets 3 stars instead of four (the service and the small margaritas). The food get's FIVE stars. I planning on going back here several more times"}
{"text":"This was a great place to go for Mexican food.  Lots of lunch specials to choose from and a full bar.  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Don Lencho's.  We had Connie as our server and she was friendly and very helpful throughout our time there.  We had margaritas (very good), fajitas, burritos and tacos... all fresh and delicious. Definitely a find!!"}
{"text":"favorite family Mexican / seafood restaurant ever!!! very very good food (my favorite is anything carne asada very good cooked meat) and everyone who regularly comes in while youre there, one of the waiters/waitresses know them by first name basis and already know what they want to drink. very very good service every time. have taken my family and friends here and they all love it!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a Great traditional mexican food restaurant.  The service has been consistently friendly and the food delicious.  i have enjoyed the Chimichanga with rice and beans and the enchilada tamale combo.  Both were delicious!  The chips are fresh and the salsa very tasty. Decorated with bright serapes and colorful paintings this is a local treasure.  A sure bet for a great meal at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"So hard to find somewhere that captures the taste of authentic Mexican cuisine. This place is the jam!!! By far, the best food in town!"}
{"text":"Celeste was our server and she was the best, we had exceptional service, but the place had very few customers. we only had drinks and an app, it was good."}
{"text":"I will be making this short and not so sweet. The food was good until I found hair in it. It was more disturbing when the manager expected me to continue eating off of that plate and expected me to pay for it after only 4 bites. I will not be back to eat here."}
{"text":"As always, at the end you find the beginning.   This is where my love of food was first forged, something like 18 years ago.  You will find me then as you find me now, Lost deep within a bowl of Vuelve a la Vida.  I've had everything on their menu at least once or five times.   Vuelve a la Vida is what always brings me back.   These are the smells & treasures that roused you from bed as a child, pulled you dreamy-eyed, down the stairs to your moms kitchen for what you knew was going to be A replenishing life-giving meal.   Over the years, it's been my office, and a second home. I love this place. I could never thank the family for their generosity & hospitality."}
{"text":"I cannot get enough of this restaurant. Don Lencho's is family owned and operated and serving up some amazingly delicious mariscos (seafood) and mexican food. Some of my favorite dishes include: menudo, chilaquiles with carne asada, and the vulve la vida (seafood cocktail with octopus, oysters, shrimp and clams). I always leave completely satisfied and find myself craving this food practically every day! Happy hour is also available every day which offers a wide variety of affordable drinks. Try the Mango Margarita, yum."}
{"text":"I am always on the hunt for shrimp enchiladas and can rarely find them. Had them here tonight and they were amazing!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was nice, but the food was very average. Salsa was ok, chips were cripy."}
{"text":"After reading all reviews, I have to say that it is a good place for a good food! Agree with Yelpers for decor - need to upgrade! But not agree with some Yelpers for salsa- it is unique taste & looks watery - I had the same taste in different mex places.... Just unique taste. YES! Carne Acada plate was delusionsssssssssss!"}
{"text":"So satisfying! Ceviche was great and you just can't go wrong with Chile Verde. Busy night but great service."}
{"text":"I have lived here for a year and so far this is the best and authentic Mexican food I have had !! Reasonably priced"}
{"text":"Have lived around the corner from this place for almost 4 yrs and finally ate here 3 months ago. Guess what? Been in here almost every week since. Especially for the CAT FISH fillet EVERY FRIDAY it's amazing!!! I can't say everything has been perfect every time but it's pretty darn great!! Chile relleno so good, carnitas good, carne asada good, beans, rice, green chile, love the homemade tortillas!! I'm hekka picky with the Mexican food and this place is nice, the food has tons of flavor. If you want that bland no flavor Mexican food is probably pass. Employees are friendly even when your kid spills an entire soda all over the table!! Just call us regulars here."}
{"text":"I went there with a large group of people (13 in all).  The food was ok, and the service was fair...it was the resulting 72 hours of vicious food poisoning that ALL 13 of us experienced.  It's pretty safe to say that Don Lencho's was the culprit, as half of the group was family that was from out of town, only in for the night and left the next day (yup they got sick while on a road trip home), and we did not eat any other meals together or even stay in the same house.  This may have been a touch of bad luck...but I'm not going to try my luck there again....EVER."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times and the food is pretty good. Really nice people that work there.  I'm told by my Alex that this restaurant use to be a Pizza Hut, i could see that :) I had the Carne asada #8, lots of food, i can never eat it all, nor should i try, i got a tummy ache this last time. My  Alex got a Torta Adobada, requested no pico, because of the onions and tomatoes, the Torta came with a pile of them on top, but no pico. I guess, our only complaint would be listing all the ingredients on the menu. That kind of ruined the dish but he refused to tell them about the onions nor send it back. That is just the way my Alex is, no confrontation. He did however liked the flavor of the meat.  We will be back of course, there is so much to try on their menu, we like the place, so we want to give it another shot.  Besides, its right next door to the Theater Works and we like to see shows there."}
{"text":"Very good food!  Reminds us of Rocky Pointe!!  Nice quaint family owned restaurant with excellent food!! Wife and I love it!!"}
{"text":"First off, our server was a delightful young gal. Unfortunately, I don't remember her name and I don't have one of those nifty receipts that includes the servers name. I tip on service even if the food isn't the best, it's not the servers fault. Nothing worse than having a crappy server bring you nasty food. But not last night. Had a wonderful server bring us \"okay\" food.  My daughter loved their Ceviche Tostado but not the bread on the Torta. I had the #1, shredded beef taco, cheese enchilada with rice and beans and I'll just say that I have had better. It is a \"mom &  pop\" and I am always in favor of spending my dollars there.  BUT, both the big guys and the little guys are putting less meat in the tacos, less cheese in the enchilada and adding an extra buck to this and that, here and there.   Now,with that said, I always try a place a second time. But it will be during Happy Hour for 2.00 bottled beer, Ceviche Tostado and a big Cheese Crisp. Their cheese crisp looked mighty tastey!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I only went to Don Lencho's for a Happy Hour drink. I didn't eat dinner. I've driven past Lencho's for years but never stopped. No particular reason why. I was near, and decided to finally go and get a drink. Staff was friendly. I got a seat at a table, read the menu & ordered a beer. They no longer sold that beer. Okay, asked for a different beer on the menu. Nope, didn't have that either. Found one that they still carry. Server brought out chips & salsa. Horrible! Chips were less than room temperature, hard & tasted like the chips came straight out of the bag. I doubt I'll ever eat at Don Lencho's."}
{"text":"The food and service here are always great. The bad reviews seem to center on alcohol, but I can't say I've ever bought a margarita or beer here. I've never had a complaint and I will keep coming here for good food and friendly service."}
{"text":"We've been eating there for years. Flavorful food, all of it. They must make their own tortillas because I never feel the tortillas are just there to hold the good stuff. It's all a delicious, everything is well prepared and made of fresh ingredients.  Friendly attentive staff, warm atmosphere, considerate guests."}
{"text":"The interior is dressed like an \"Amercanized\" Mexican food joint, but the flavors are good and authentic. Went for lunch and had a tasty Vuelve a la Vida Coctel! Mmmmm!"}
{"text":"The beans are cooked with lard and the rice with chicken broth.  The place is not suitable for vegetarians."}
{"text":"This is one of my families favorite places to eat.  The staff is so kind and caring and always going the extra mile for their customers.  The owner puts a lot of care into her food and the service the customers get.  Now I will be honest this is not a fancy place but if you are looking for great food in a locally owned small business this is the spot.  Some of my absolute favorites are the queso fundido with chorizo, steak ranchero and their chimichangas.  Several on my family love their shrimp ranchero and shrimp cocktail.  I have never ordered anything from their menu that I didn't enjoy."}
{"text":"Cute little restaurant with decent food.  I ordered  a single fish taco and it came with enough fish to make two tacos which was a pleasant surprise.  Satisfied with the food however the staff could have been more friendly.  Left there thinking the staff must really dislike their jobs.  Glad I tried it but more than likely won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Too many watered down Mexican restaurants . Not this place! Great chiliquiles, red chili that tastes like red chili, not gravy. The hot sauce is actually hot. What a concept!     It's a good sign when you're  the only anglos in the joint. Next time you need a \"morning after\" breakfast visit DON lenchos. Hey just visit the next time you want real mexican food."}
{"text":"I'm puzzled by the bad reviews too.  Every time I've been there for lunch, I walk away a happy and satisfied hombre.  The chips are warm, served with two kinds of salsa. I asked for refried beans with my chips, and they accommodated by bringing a large portion with melted cheese... no charge.    Today I had tacos carnitas for lunch. The pork was perfectly crispy yet tender.  The pico de gallo added the perfect heat, and the guacomole is delicious. The combo included three tacos with double corn tortillas, small green salad, extra pico de gallo, sour cream, and refried beans.  Deliciouso!  The service is good.  The waiter came around several times and responded well to eye contact.  It wasn't busy, maybe five or six tables being served.  Never been there at dinner time, so I can't comment on that.  Three of us ate lunch for $36 with three soft drinks, and were completely satisfied."}
{"text":"Don Lencho's is my favorite authentic Mexican food joint in the Valley.  The place is a hidden treasure tucked away in Peoria, I'm surprised more people don't know about it.  Always clean and inviting.  The staff always goes the extra mile to make sure the guest is at home and receives great service."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place on accident and wasn't to excited because the outside isn't flattering.  We were greeted as we entered and was one of few tables.  Interior is not as flattering but we took to the menu.  Food was amazing, authentic and fresh.  The Margaritas were delicious as well.   Price was right.  As we ate the service slowed because there was one server for the entire place and a lot of tables came all at once.  Overall we decided we would definitely be back and were pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Everyone's so nice. Our waitress was so friendly.   But here's the thing...the food is disgusting. They give you free stale chips and salsa. In our group we had ordered tortas, camarones rancheros, and fish. The tortas were uh interesting to look at that's for sure, the bread was burnt and the meat was red..I've had tortas in the past plenty of times and I've never seen any like the one I had here, after we left the restaurant I was really scared I was going to get food poisoning.   My brother had the fried fish..it was flavorless. Tasted like absolutely nothing.   The camarones rancheros were the absolute worst. The situation was almost laughable because they were so bad. Camarones rancheros are usually spicy and flavorful. These were just cooked in tomato sauce and onion. That's it! No flavor at all. When I asked the waitress if they were supposed to be like this she said yeah and that these were the best, I knew she was lying. The rice and beans that came with it weren't good either.   We half a** ate our food, we payed, we left.   When we got in the car my little brother told us that when he went to the bathroom OUR waitress was in there cleaning the bathrooms, and she asked him to go under the stall and unlock it because it was locked from the inside. Why the freak was our waitress, the person that gave us our FOOD and DRINKS be cleaning the bathrooms?! Gross. AND why the freaking freak would she think it's appropriate to ask my younger brother to get on his hands and knees to get under the stall?!?!? I was just in shock.   NEVER EVER going back.   The only reason we went to this restaurant was because they had ok reviews on yelp but nope, I don't recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"The happy hour menu was really good. I appreciated the kid menu as well. My husband had a really greasy meal which grossed him out but I had a carne asada quesidilla that was to die for. The place was super quiet during the beginning of supper but shortly picked up with lots of families. The decor looks italian but don't let that fool you! I would try it again to see if we can all get a great meal!"}
{"text":"My family and I come here often especially weekends for the menudo.  This is the best menudo I have had out here in Arizona.  Chips and salsa are great.  We have always had very good and quick service."}
{"text":"The service was horrible and the food was cold and disgusting. I always finish my food, but I didn't even want their nasty food in my fridge. You have to be drunk or on something to enjoy this food. And if you think this is real Mexican food, you haven't been out."}
{"text":"Always been a great spot always very consistent in everything weather it be food, service or just all around comfortable environment. I go here very often and I will continue to do so. Keep it up Don Lencho's."}
{"text":"My family has been eating at Don Lenchos since moving to the West side in 2007. The service is good and the food is better. Nothing fancy here, just really good Mexican food like your Abuela or Tia would make at home."}
{"text":"Usually get a pretty good meal. Although today the seafood soup was tough, not a good lunch. And no military discount :(. Besides that pretty good chips and salsa, and they have orange soda."}
{"text":"Went there last night for the first time and referrals from my friends. Margarita were on special for 2.25 each had 2 they were very good. Did the chimi it was good however the only reason I give it a 4 is because I asked for extra green sauce and extra extra extra cheese. I said I would pay for it however there was no extra sauce and extra cheese. I will go again and I will give a 5 if my request are met. Wait staff very nice and decent service. Really think the young waiter was a plus. Good for the business and for for Don Lencho."}
{"text":"This is a find!  Colorful decor and food that is a cut above your average Mexican fare.  I actually had the grilled shrimp soup which was wonderful.  A flavorful broth with large pieces of vegetables (carrots, onions, celery, squash) and a generous portion of shrimp and fresh warm tortillas on the side made for a memorable meal.    My companion enjoyed the chicken enchiladas with rice and beans and enjoyed every morsel.  Our waitress was delightful and her service was top notch.  We chatted with her on the way out about the Menudo Soup that they make from scratch there.   Menudo, a fabled hangover remedy, is made with tripe (beef stomach) in a broth with red chilles and only the cook knows what else.    The decor is colorful - my glass of chardonnay was very adequate and a generous pour.  I'll definitely be back - maybe not for the Menudo though."}
{"text":"This place is soooo good! I have been here multiple times and the shrimp enchiladas are my favorite!!! The staff is also super sweet and helpful. Some of the best Mexican food I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Discovered this place as I was browsing through Yelp and wanted to stop at a good family Mexican restaurant with good reviews. The Amazing reviews are completely valid! This place is delicious and I would recommend it to anyone. Very friendly family service and awesome hospitality. The food was also just so amazing! I got the wet shrimp burrito that was filled with giant shrimp and covered in delicious fish sauce. So amazing!"}
{"text":"Service was attentive and the entrées were great. The salsa was really boring and could be kicked up several notches. Quesadilla was done to perfection. Gooey rich cheese perfectly melted on a well cooked tortilla. This was oven prepared not microwave. Tortilla was delicious. Husband had a burrito and loved it.  Bathrooms not the cleanest."}
{"text":"Don Lenchos is located in Old Town Peoria, right off Peoria. The building looks like it may have been an old Pizza Hut at one time.    The service was good.  Reminder I'm a Mexican Food snob and picky, Had the Crispy Tacos which was pretty good, meat was little greasy.  The beans are actually tasty, not a fan of the rice. The Michelada was AMAZING."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite local family run Mexican place. I haven't had anything here I've been disappointed with. Fresh made and great service. Friday nights can be busy as it's small and popular. During the week is fabulous though!"}
{"text":"Funny decor, very nice waitstaff and owners and really delicious home cooked food is how I would describe Don Lenchos.  I especially love their fish and shrimp dishes.I always get the shrimp cocktail which to me tastes like a kind of gazpacho with shrimp in a very slightly sweet, cold tomato soup with onions, cucumbers, peppers, avocado, and very many icy cold perfectly cooked shrimp.  The seafood burrito in white sauce and the garlic shrimp are two other favorites. Queso fundido with chorizo and the caldo de camarón are also fantastic.  But everything on the menu has aways been fantastic."}
{"text":"Food was super good ! And service was very good ! Even though they were very busy waitresses still was on her toes and made us feel super good ! Can't wait to go again !"}
{"text":"I'm from L.A. and,after moving to Surprise, I missed my East L.A. Mexican restaurants.  Then I moved to Peoria and found Don Lencho's.  I test the authenticity of Mexican restaurants by having Campehana.  Only real Mexicans can prepare it correctly.  Theirs is fantastic and so is the rest of their menu."}
{"text":"My secret neighborhood Mexican place. Great food, cheap beer prices and usually half empty. Don't tell anyone, I like it is the way it is!"}
