{"text":"Had the JB burger. It was amazing, along with the customer service. I wouldn't get a combo again, the  fries are not the best."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm! Loved the Burger here. Ordered the 9oz cheese burger because I was craving a real Burger! Fantastic! Had the wedge fries and they were amazing! Would come back here again and again!"}
{"text":"We tried JB burger,chicken wings, coleslaw and cheese fries.everything was delicious and freshly made which is not very common for halal restaurants."}
{"text":"Had the gazebo burger..seemed like I made it myself at home..nothing special about it. The chicken steak sandwich was just average too. Best halal burgers are at On The Bun in Mississauga."}
{"text":"Lovely little burger join that's kept it old school. Cute colors and interior serving delicious burgers and poutine.   The burger - got a JB BBQ Burger - no extra toppings - just had it as it's done! Was pretty good actually! I quite enjoyed the flavours of the beef  The poutine - amazing, super crunchy fries with proper gravy - only wish they put more gravy - even after asking for extra heavy, it looked less.  Also had Chicken cheese steak - amazing blend of     And it's Halal!!   Insta - theKhanaGuy"}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday during the long weekend, used a Groupon, the place was packed. I found everything to be rather expensive even with the Groupon.  There was a 10 minute wait to order. After ordering the cashier said \"there will be a wait with your food cause the kitchen is backed up\". I forgot to order 1 sandwich so I went right back, I asked her if she can bring it out with my other order and she said \"she'll try\". I noticed many people around me sending their food back, asking how much longer it would be... I was quite nervous.  After about 32 minutes after ordering (way too long for a burger and fries place!) I got my food and it was exactly what I ordered and she even brought the extra sandwich at the same time. I was very impressed until I saw a LONG HAIR coming out of the shrimp sandwich.... YUCK. I pointed it out to her right away, she grabbed the hair, analyzed it and said sorry. She asked if we wanted to take it back... we were so hungry after 30 minutes of waiting and it didn't seem like anyone was wearing hair nets anyways so I didn't bother. Every time we at the melted cheese we were all paranoid it was another hair. The funnel cake ($12) we ordered had rotten strawberries on it that were literally black, they put it in syrup so you can't see it until you taste it, the middle was also a little raw.   Other than the bad service, extremely long wait, hair in my food, rotten strawberries the other items were actually tasty (burger, chilli cheesy fries & Philly cheesesteak). Overall not worth the drive, wait, prices and service. Will definitely not be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"pretty decent burgers. With whole setup of a classic american diner. Friendly staff. Chili cheese fries here is the real deal !"}
{"text":"Probably my new favorite restaurant - with limitations as to how many visits, of course; as the food isn't \"healthy\". What's also funny is, I'm not a burgers & fries type of guy, but this place makes an exception.  I love an old Diner experience, with the retro booths, tiled flooring, and checkered chairs. It's hard to find these types of restaurants in the area, which is what makes Gazebo a gem.   Their burgers? Amazing... Juicy. Fresh. And Huge. You get to choose alot of free toppings from, probably, over 20 ingredients and condiments. The more the merrier.  Their fries? The best. I think it's been 6 years since I've had fries as good as Gazebo's. They're extremely crunchy, tasty, and the best part; they're not smothered in oil. Why, yes, as they may be fries, you'd think they'd be oily. But nope. The fries have just the right amount of oil to make you not feel guilty after eating it. These fries probably beat every other restaurant in Oakville's out of the park!   The only reason I subtract a star in this rating is because it's pretty pricey. However, if you go with a Groupon, it's really really worth it. Also, on a weekday lunch service is rather slow.   If you're wondering whether or not Gazebos is worth a meal visit, you can put your thoughts to a hault. Because the answer is YES. YOU SHOULD.   I'll be back next week ;)"}
{"text":"Exceptional customer service and one of the best fries and burgers in town. Pimento burger and Gazebo burger are the juiciest on the menu. Nicest staff ever, they will wait until you are done with your meal, even past closing hours."}
{"text":"The first thing I noticed when we entered this restaurant was how sparkling clean it was. Service was fantastic, food amazingly delicious! We loved loved loved this place. Had the Gazebo burgers with fries & onion rings. The burgers were extremely juicy, fall apart juicy. The french fries & onions rings were very generous portions. We will be back :)"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. I've ordered delivery from this place a few times and they are always very quick and friendly. Burgers are pretty standard diner fare. Fries are excellent and you can get them with gravy, as a poutine, with cheese sauce, or chilli and cheese sauce which are my favourite. Portions are generous.  I ordered a chicken sandwich last week and it was good, though a bit dry. I feel they could pound it flat as well, to ensure more even bites. They do offer the chicken breasts breaded or grilled, which is nice to see as well.  I will definitely order again!"}
{"text":"Great diner experience. Tasty food and pricing worth it. Service outstanding. Will go back"}
{"text":"Yum!  Clean. Friendly. Good food. I'm very impressed. Right up the road from Sheridan. A great treat after a long week. Can't wait to explore the menu even more"}
{"text":"Real fries and lemonade, not made from powder. They are so tasty I promise I will order them again next time. Burgers are all right, not the best I have had but not bad. Environment is good though, quiet and comfy. Good for meeting up with friends.  I checked in the restaurant on yelp, got 10% off coupon, and was told they dont take coupons at weekends. Kind of suck."}
{"text":"Inconsiderate manager.no customer loyalty and unwillingness to understand the situation."}
{"text":"Best Halal Burgers Had So Far !!  I came across this place on Google and it had great reviews, the fact it was Halal made it much more appealing to try it out. It was our first time here and luckily we even got a WagJag voucher for the same.  In $20, it included 2 Signature Burgers, 1 Signature Side and 2 Desserts, now that's a deal you cannot miss.   The ambience is cool and looks like a retro burger joint. The server was very helpful and guided us through the menu and the voucher terms.   We ordered JB Burger and a Chicken Sandwich, Cheese Fries. For the dessert instead of taking 2, we opted for their regular Funnel Cakes with Ice Cream topping.  The wait time was not much and the entire order came. The Cheese Fries were hot and delicious, good we asked for the Cheese on the side. (They have choices for type of Cheese). The Burgers were juicy to the core and the taste was delicious as well. If it wasn't for the appetite, it was so great could have an another one easily. Both the Burgers were equally good and worth every bite!  Now that the dessert came, the Funnel Cakes were just ok, they were more on the harder side than soft, better ones at Wonderland. The ice cream and brownie quantity was good.   All in All had an excellent meal, came home and right away purchased 3 more of the WagJag Vouchers.   Ambience - 4/5 Food - 4/5 Price - 3/5 (if taken without the voucher, it can be pricey)  Service -4/5  Excellent Place, Surely Going Back Totally Recommend it !!"}
{"text":"Great place to get halal food, portions are excellent and we'll worth it. Place gets busy"}
{"text":"My best favorite burger in the town, I like it with the fast service. Clean , nice music in the place. Worth to visit."}
{"text":"Sure the interior and atmosphere is great of the restaurant. It resembles a diner, has bubble gum pink seats etc. The food however is nothing great. My grilled chicken burger was overdone, difficult to bite into and there was literally no flavor, no sauce, and no seasoning in it. The fries were deep friend and crunchy, probably the best thing I ordered out of the two burgers and fries. The prices are also relatively high, definitely not worth the bland food. I would like to compliment the food, but realistically, there is no room for that.   Also, the Sprite did not taste like Sprite  Nice touch to have complimentary dates, lentil soup, water, coffee and tea for breaking fast in Ramadan"}
{"text":"Went there tonight, we had the double 6oz burger with chilli cheese fries and butterflied shrimps. Food was amazing!!! We will return sooner than later. Everything was perfect, not one flaw. Great staff great really care! Good job!!!"}
{"text":"Halal  This place looks great. It had such a great diner feel. The ambiance is so much fun and totally different. When you walk in you really feel like you're in a 60s diner.   There burger and menu choices are great as well. Definitely great tasting food with proper diner style portions.   Great place!"}
