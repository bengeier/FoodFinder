{"text":"My husband and I are at Sassy's 2-3 times a week  beer IS cold, food is not the usual bar fare, which is a nice change   They have an actual chef running the kitchen!!!!  The staff is attentive. I'm so pleased to see a local business doing well in Twinsburg!!!"}
{"text":"The food was average, and that was the highlight of my visit.  The service would have to have improved greatly to just be bad."}
{"text":"Great place!!!  Good live music many nights of the week!  Has great menu for a bar!  Would recomend Sassy's for parties as well as local hang out."}
{"text":"Good food. Great bartenders.  And a very friendly atmosphere.  Everyone is very welcoming."}
{"text":"Great local bar with a great core of regulars.  I'm relatively new, but most make you feel welcomed. Food is great, I particularly like the dry rub wings.  Service can get a bit slow, especially when they get slammed.  But overall I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This place is a diamond in the rough. Great service, tasty food and fun atmosphere. Bring your friends you will have a fantastic time. Check it out. Its free to look."}
{"text":"I can't believe some of these reviews. It must be that somebody is out to get them. This place is BOMB! Love it. Friendliest service and great food. These bad reviews are very suspect to me. I say go and make up your own mind.

Also to be noted all 3 reviews are written on 2/18...hmmmmm."}
{"text":"My original review was deleted. Maybe they thought I was kidding.

But no! Our visit here was destroyed by a derranged drug addict\drunk who was running around the bar area & threatening to kill people. Seriously! Be sure to arm yourself! Very scary looking bikers abound!"}
{"text":"This bar is confused about their demographic maybe touchtunes is to blame. There's not much consistency with the crowd or drinks. Great people, decent facility they just don't have much of an identity which is confusing for me as a patron"}
{"text":"Food was very good.  Service was excellent....Steph is a great host.  Was just fine for kids....we had 3 with is for a 7pm dinner.

The only thing standing in the way of 5 stars was that my ribs were warm, but not hot....I like my food served at peak temp.  Also, my 11 yo said his burger was burnt on one side.

A couple people had the wings, and loved them.  My wife liked her burger."}
{"text":"Arrived Sunday at 12 a few minutes after 5 friends. Food apparently comes in rounds. First 2 meals arrived after 30 minutes. 2nd two meals arrived 5 minutes later. A fifth sandwich came 10 minutes later.  The last 2, ours,  arrived 25 minutes after that. Keep in mind there were only 2 other people in the bar and they weren't eating. Worst service I've experienced in some time. Food was satisfactory bit nothing to get excited about."}
{"text":"Sorry Adam C. I went to Sassy's to form my own opinion and have to agree with Melissa S. on some points.  My husband & myself went on a Sunday afternoon around 1 p.m.. Before we even got in the door I noticed Twinsburg police followed us in the lot and slowly pulled in front of the establishment, probably running plates. When we got into Sassys there was 3 other customers at the bar and
they also noticed the police. The manager went outside to see what the issue was, needless to say she's not fond of the police. I guess they feel the cops are harassing their patrons. Unfortunately, this day an age police harassment still continues, I grew up with it going to predominately Caucasian Catholic schools in predominately Caucasian neighborhoods so that doesn't phase me.

Sassys itself has good modern decor, decent size inside, patio, stage for a band, good customer service from the barmaid.  Now, the menu is a little pricey for bar food. The menu consist mainly of appetizers (nachos, fried pickles, mozzarella sticks) wings, salads, burgers, and sandwiches.  We got our food to go after the whole police fiasco.  My husband ordered the so called homemade nachos with cheese and jalapenos.  He was not impressed by the menu & had a few choice words after we left, he was not happy with his food.  Like Melissa S. stated in her review, the nachos are nothing more than store bought chips they threw in some hot grease put some cheese sauce and jalapenos on. Since our food was to go, when he ate a chip in the car he fussed furiously said they weren't even hot let alone warm and said I shouldn't have left a $5 tip. After seeing on the news that minimum wages in Ohio are increasing but tipped workers only make $3.83, I can't make myself do that.

I ordered a flatbread with limp crabmeat for $9. There was hardly any crabmeat on the flatbread, more cheese, caramelized onions and roasted red peppers.  By the words of my husband we won't be back, he'd rather go to Tailgators. They get 1 star for service."}
{"text":"Great rock music. Hot chilly, good food.  Amazing friendly, happy, welcoming staff. All you could want in a local pub"}
{"text":"This is my second time being here for lunch and the first time was a very positive experience. First time the food was good and service was good as well. 

Second time going here was not the same experience.  Service was good as always. Food on the other hand was not very good. Mozzarella Wedges had hardly any cheese in them... Do not get them. My friend got the loaded tots and the cheese was cold.  Buffalo chicken wrap was good and my friends chicken Cesar wrap she says was ok. My garlic waffle fries were drenched in garlic sauce which I couldn't finish them.  Our soft drinks were warm and flat. I think it's safe to say that will be our last time going back."}
{"text":"Sassy's is a definite upgrade from Tali-Gators and the rest of the local options.  The female staff is personable, competent, and engaging (not to mention attractive).  There are inspired touches that make it truly unique like the color-changing lights in the mirrors behind the bar with matching stars in the floor around it.  It is little touches like these that not only upgrade the atmosphere from high-end sports bar to late night music venue but also demonstrate the attention to detail and inspiration that only a dedicated and passionate business owner would even think of.  I was fortunate to be present for both and I must say the classic rock cover act that performed was a nice surprise and a good reason to stay after MNF ended.  There was a nice mix of girls and guys, the drinks were reasonably priced, and the food was surprisingly good.  Sassy's is the shining exception to everything Twinsburg has to offer.  Check it out."}
{"text":"Very good late night food. Not at all what I expected. NOT \"bar food\". Very flavorful. Stephanie was very welcoming and Brooks cooked up some amazing chicken. My coworker I came in late and they stayed open for us to get there to eat."}
{"text":"Don't order the steak special.  Not cooked to order and tasted like it was frozen.  Good salads few dressing selections like french or 1000 island. Great music and loud like you would expect from live bands. Average draft selection; however, great craft bottle selection.  Great atmosphere on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"What a awesome atmosphere with a safe environment to have your own private party or meet new people. The management accommodates for whatever event you chose. A great for game watching. Tv's are in everybody's view. The food is QUALITY bar food along with the daily specials which are our favorites. No skimping when it comes to enjoying your favorite drink."}
{"text":"Nice local bar in a shopping center off the main highways. Have bands, karaoke and special fun activities.  Good list of local brews. Did not try the food, but the menu and daily special looked yummy. Will come here again for a relaxed time."}
{"text":"Love this bar! Stopped by for the first time when I was visiting my boyfriend's family. Stephanie, the owner, is sincerely such a sweetheart, and did a fantastic job on this place. Great service, lively atmosphere, everything you're looking for in a bar and grille. They're always putting the customer first, so don't believe the hype. I say try it out - its really a great spot. :) My two cents!"}
