{"text":"This has to be the hippest bar in town.  I mean, full beard, chunky glasses, skinny jeans HIP!  You want to know how I know?  OK, you know how, like, bars often have phone service and will advertise that phone number on their contact details on their website?  I called Becky's to ask about when their trivia night began and what the basic rules are, and you know what?  Somebody picked up the phone and sat it on the bar.  And left it there.  For fifteen minutes!  Not so much as a hello, JOE nor a hi, bye or kiss my ass!   :  )  Now THAT is strutting the hipsterness, maaaaan."}
{"text":"Once again Yelp did us right!  Found this place and had a great time. Went here to have a few drinks before a show and the people were very nice. Had a good happy hour and the service was good....actually left and forgot or tickets to the show on the bar and when we called back they were holding them for us. Really saved our a$$!  Thanks again!!!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff. No pretense. Mixed crowd-black, white, old, young. Random music ranging from 70s pop to Rihanna to Christmas music. We had steak and pierogies--delicious and enough to split between two people. I love this bar."}
{"text":"I don't understand how a bar like this has 4 stars. This place is a bad joke. Came in on a little before midnight on a Saturday and asked someone who from behind, I thought was a woman working the bar, where the restroom was about 4 times. After the 5th, \"excuse me\", bartender turns around who, turns out to be a guy who just has hair down to his waist. My fault. Points me to the end of the bar to a room that isn't lit. The smell of feces reaches my nose before I could even reach in my pocket to grab the flashlight my phone provides. Throw the light into an unflushed toilet of disgust. Come back to the bar and the \"guy\" and another girl working have their backs turned to entire bar. Only when a bellowing, \"HEY\" from across the bar is heard, do they turn around. And right when that bottle touches the bar in front of that customer, it's back to the tv. Closed captioning for a 1980s movie. Had to go into the bar to ask for a menu because of how unattentive these two simpletons were.   After what seems like forever, the man next to me asks for his check which I see as my moment to get my order in. As the bartender is pouring my all too foam-y pint, the man next to me starts staring at his receipt with is glasses off. \"I NEVER GOT MY CHILI\". To no response. He comes back with my pint and is met with another, \"I NEVER GOT MY CHILI\". Sorry about that sir. Let me take that out for you. \"I ORDERED THAT AT 11 SON!\" I'm sorry again sir, with the beer foam dissipating from the pint still in his hand. By the time it reaches me, a clear inch is absent from the top.  20 minutes later, with the empty glass I manage to wave someone bringing food from the kitchen down to order a beer I notice on the chalkboard. I look down and what is he carrying, but a bowl of chili. \"Can I have another beer?\" Oh I don't work the bar. You have to ask that guy. The chili reaches longhair in the middle of him explaining the plot of the movie to one of the customers nearby my stool. \"Who ordered this? Oh right. No he left. He said he didn't want it. Oh yeah you want another beer? The Great Lakes? Oh we only have one bottle left and that girl over there has it.\" He opens a sliding fridge in front of me with a Pabst Blue Ribbon with a, \"How 'bout a Pabst?\" to which I just nod.   3 beers in, nearing 1 am, a bell rings behind me and I see the guy bringing the fish and chips towards the bar. He turns his head to a couple throwing darts with a, \"nice throw.\" Turns back to deliver the food and notices the coleslaw and a handful of fries have fell from the plate. He looks around to see if anyone has witnessed this, and keeps trekking. He delivers the food next to a register and scurries back to the kitchen. Don't see him til after last call has been announced at 1:30am. It takes a couple waves to get someone to bring the food over, which isn't half bad. Well what's left of it anyways. Last call comes and I order another \"Pabst\". 2 girls run in about 10 minutes later dressed like a nightclub in Vegas just swished them around in it's mouth and vomited them into the bar. \"ARE WE TOO LATE?! PLEASE. UM. ANYTHING. CAN I HAVE A GREAT LAKES. OH ITS YOUR LAST ONE?! YEAH CAN I HAVE THAT AND 2 SHOTS OF JAMISON. THANKS\"  If you're under the age of 21, want to get trashed and yell the night away, playing darts, shoving George Washington's into a jukebox, while spending 4 bucks a beer, this is your spot. Welcome to idiot town. Mayor: long haired ponytail owning @$$hole."}
{"text":"The cooks are very talented!  Brings the food items far beyond \"bar food.\"  The standard menu isn't huge, but it's diverse and the specials offer a lot of variety.  The usually have a number of vegetarian options, including soups which are superb!"}
{"text":"Omg. Great drinks. But this review is due the best jerk wings I've ever had. Order them. You won't regret it. A little kick...burr not to much. Will definitely be back....next week."}
{"text":"Becky's is \"definitely awesome.\"  Becky's is an awesome dive bar just a few blocks off of Playhouse Square.  As the kind police officer at the gas station informed me when I tried to buy beer after 1 a.m., Becky's is the only place in town that has a liquor license to sell after the 1 a.m. curfew.  My friend and I went to Becky's around 1:15, after having performed that night.  The bartender persuaded us not to buy their expensive takeout beer and instead hooked us up with some free beers and cheap shots.  We were served extremely well by the kind lady behind the bar, caroused with the friendly locals despite being from out of town, and even got a couple free car bombs from a kind gentleman at the bar.    Becky's rocks!  If I'm ever back in Cleveland, I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Great bar to hang out with friends. Friendly staff and good food. The environment is overall pretty good; bathrooms aren't the best but it's a bar. As a student at CSU, this is a great place to go within walking distance.  Would definitely recommend going for drinks here at least once. Get some friends and have a good time!"}
{"text":"While dining at this establishment my group was basically told that we were in the way. We were asked to switch tables to accommodate a larger party, I have never experienced this type of treatment in my 28 years of living! Do not patronize this establishment!!!!!!!! I came to this hole in the wall to enjoy the company of my co workers after a long day, and was treated with disrespect! DO NOT SUPPORT!"}
{"text":"Out of towners looking for a place to eat dinner.   15 minutes to place an order and 30 minutes to get a meal. The menu said fresh cooked burgers of quality meat..dont think so. Charred to imperfection, rubbery tasting meat. Better burgers from a fast food joint."}
{"text":"Awesome bar food! Best burgers perogies and wings (get the Jerk sauce!)! Awesome service and happy hour! Lots of vegetarian choices too! Fun Thursday night Trivia!"}
{"text":"While I love Becky's and I think the food is great, especially the wings but one person in particular ruined my experience there.  Becky's is your typical dive bar with no table service, which if fine.  However, I came in yesterday July 19, 2016 around 9:30 and ordered some wings with ranch and celery.  First, the nasty server Robin bought our celery and ranch first with no wings and low key just flung the food on the table and walked away.  10 minutes later he come and snatches our empty plates that had the celery and partially still full ranch cups. He never asked\" are you ladies done with this?\"  15 minutes later the wings are brought out by a nice young lady with long brown hair and I told her I am missing the ranch to dip for my wings and I ordered an additional side of jerk sauce.  She said no problem, I'll bring it right out.\"  After waiting another 5 minutes I walk to the back counter and ask the server his name (Robin) and I tell him I'm missing my ranch and additional sauce.  He says, \"Well go to front and ask for more sauce and pay and I'll bring it to you.  My reply was \"well we weren't done with our ranch and we use it to dip our wings\".  His response, \"well you aint say nothing when I grabbed it\".  My reply, \"Mr. Robin are you having a bad day or am I getting on your nerves?\"  He responded, \"NO I'm fine\" while swinging his neck like a hula-hoop. I tell him your attitude is really nasty and walked away.  I told the lead bartender a bald head white man who was really cool.  He took care of issue and I paid my additional .81 cents for the jerk sauce.    So Tony don't allow this guy to run your loyal customers away. Either train him to be better with customer service or remove that cancer from your staff.  Until there is better service, I encourage everyone to avoid this once awesome dive bar."}
{"text":"ah, becky's.  an institution in the bars of clevo.  if you go to csu or if you do theater at playhouse square, this is your bar.  or if you just want to see the actors you just saw in a show that night drinking and drunky drunkerson, this is the bar.  becky's has bar food.  good bar food.  greasy, fattening, tasty bar food.  as a matter of fact, i do believe they were voted best bar food in clevo at some point quite recently.  i do believe.  yes.  i do, virginia.  becky's is a good time.  and they have karaoke on saturday nights, when most other bars are too interested in other things on the weekends.  last night, my friends dubbed it \"kimmyoake\".  i'm ok with that.  if you go for the karaoke, they have a pretty good book of songs to choose from.  my choices ranged from some ike and tina, pat benatar, and of course, sisquo and his thong song.  ..ohhh yeah.   any place that allows it's patrons to get up and sing a happy thong song for the holidays is a great place to be.  and file this under things that make me baffled  vol. 24- why is it that there is always a token girl to get up and sing my heart will go on from titanic?  ....and why do i always feel the need to interpretive dance while she sings and run to a pretend ship's balcony at the crescendo and beat my chest like a screaching canadian songstress?  yep."}
{"text":"Becky's is a really fun place. We were here for a work function and were treated pretty much like royalty. The food was really great, the bartenders were fast, and everyone working there was super friendly. Karaoke gave the place an extra boost of fun, and the KJ (their words) was really into it, making the atmosphere very relaxed and not intimidating at all! Plus she (and her dad who was visiting her at work) belted out a few tunes themselves! There's a parking lot next to Becky's plus there is plenty of street parking. Very easy to get to -- not annoyingly \"downtown\" either. I liked this bar a lot."}
{"text":"This is, by far, my favorite bar in the greater Cleveland area thus far. It's \"divey\"....which I like but not TOO divey. Meaning they have no pretentious atmosphere but still have the local craft beers on the ready and a kitchen that stays open until 1am with a fairly decent selection of bar food.  If you want to feel comfortable, have a drink or ten, a bite to eat and aren't a total dick (or a hipster that inherently hates everything already), this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Becky's is one of the true college bars in Cleveland. It is not pretentious, just like the average CSU student, and perfect when you have a jonesin for laid back fun."}
{"text":"Had to close a bar Downtown to get prepped for my 3:00 AM Amtrak trip to Chicago, and Becky's fit the bill. I'd been before both decades ago and in recent years, but the decades-ago part was forgotten by the passage of time and the more recent ones, well, forgotten for reasons more directly related to time spent in cheap and divey bars.  But that's not an insult: I love cheap and divey bars, and if you want to show me a good time by offereing a good selection of beer (with some craft brews on tap) and liquor with stout pours at Midwestern prices, well, you could do a lot worse.   Becky's has free parking, although there's always an element of risk parking in the less-than-stellar area around Playhouse Square. Inside, it's a pretty big split-level space featuring a long bar and tables upstairs. It's a good noise level: you can hear the (pretty good and pretty cheap) jukebox while not having it drown out your conversation, and you can also spend a few hours passing the time without going broke. Good things, all around. Like many bars in Cleveland, it looks a bit like a 50's diner gone to seed, which, for all I know, it just might be.  The staff is super friendly and our bartender was quick to grab refills and chase aggressive panhandlers from the place (see note above on the neighborhood). I've heard that the food is surprisingly good, but had already eaten and so didn't find out. In any case, if you're looking for a strong neighborhood hangout near Cleveland State University, I'd certainly recommend this one, horrid bathrooms be damned."}
{"text":"Love this place. I've been coming here on and off for 30 years. Great cheap bar food. Great drinks! You will not be disappointed if you eat here. Before theatre or after theatre... or just because your in the neighborhood. You can park in their lot. And then hang out for a bit. Honestly good food. All types of people. Great way to hang out and see what's up around the CLE."}
{"text":"No no no very poor at service. I will not be back. Lunch is bad bad bad. Time slow food cold service poor. I strongly recommend anyone not to go there."}
{"text":"Becky's, I haven't seen you since undergrad.  (OY!  I have realized this is now many moons ago...)  Becky's pretty much is the same as it was in my undergrad years (I will refrain from saying how many years ago that was...) with minor differences.  i.e The old pool table is now no longer in the front of the place, in fact, there is no pool table.    I think the menu is the same as it was ahem years ago and the burgers are still yummy as well as the fries.    Darts are in the back, as before, and so are the bathrooms.  Careful to avoid the darts on your way to the john.    Bartenders were cool.    An A-OK in my book.  And a heck of alot faster than the Hoffbrauhaus aross the street."}
{"text":"It is what it is -- a divey bar, much larger than most and with a much larger menu than most -- with okay food. It was fine, but it's not likely to go on my list of places to return to."}
{"text":"Just about any flavor aka type of beer you could want. Food is filling, fast and good. The staff here at Beckys are friendly and fun."}
{"text":"Holy moly!!!  A neighborhood, non-showy, non-hipster, low-key bar that has a great offering of vegetarian food!!!  Not only vegetarian in name, but the menu even says veggie items are cooked on a separate grill!  And guess what: the veg options are really tasty!! As you might ascertain, I'm happy with the veg selection....  Besides that, the bartenders at Becky's are always friendly, attentive and pleasant to chat with.  No attitude, no BS, just quality.   Becky's is a great place to have a tasty drink & a good meal in a laid-back atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've been into Becky's several times since moving to the neighborhood and have had all very positive experiences for the most part. I was pleasantly surprised as to how good the food is - I've had the burger, wings, salad...all very good for bar food. Probably some of the best I've had in all of Cleveland for cheap bar food actually. The best part about this bar is the wide variety of people you will see here - from the college 21 year old white boy to the 65 year old city worker black woman - you will see all ranges of colors and ages which is cool to see."}
{"text":"Use to have  great karaoke night. But i think they changed owners or something. Food is good depending on who's cooking seems to have fell off"}
{"text":"One bartender for sit down and bar service but service still wasn't that bad.  Wings and turkey club were \"cookie cutter\" like every other bar. Get the basket of fries..."}
{"text":"Don't expect to find anything Art Deco, modernista, or couture. This is a dive bar. And, it's one of the best in Cleveland, if not the world. The kitchen is open late, there are specials every night of the week, and the few taps circulate once in a blue moon. The bartenders are nice, the food is on point, and the dart boards are always open. It's a home away from home.   Also, tater tots. Also, Saturday Karaoke. Also, Taco Tuesday."}
{"text":"This is a great local dive for small groups of less than 6 people. I took a group of 18 folks to dinner here and we waited an hour for our appetizers. Not cool. However, I've been here for a late dinner with 4 folks and the food came out super quick.   The food is very good here and well priced! Drinks and bartenders are wonderful. A great place to connect with local folks."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem for pretty much anyone who didn't go to CSU.   I'd seen the place when I was in the area for shows at Playhouse Square but never ventured in. From the outside it looks like a potentially rough dive especially since there really isn't much other than the Conrad's around it.   A friend of mine who goes to CSU was there for trivia with friends and invited me along. Upon entering I was pleasantly surprised, it was divey but definitely not in a grimey or run down sort of way. It looked like your average sports/dive bar. They have a pretty extensive beer list and it seemed like trivia was a pretty popular event at the bar.   The beer prices were a little higher than I would expect from a \"college bar\" but not by much and the food prices were pretty cheap. I'd definitely go back if I'm in the area for a casual night."}
{"text":"A solid three stars.  The fries I had were good, the beers are reasonably priced, and the bartenders are nice.  But dang, it's lit like a high school gym, and there is no background noise besides people talking.   If you are traveling through and trying to get a drink in a dive, this is not your place. I'm sure it's rad for students though."}
{"text":"Such an awesome little bar! Stopped in with my best friend and we had an amazing meal. The pierogis are out of this world! Would highly recommend this little place to anyone that wants a good time and some incredible food!!"}
{"text":"I had a great time here and found exactly what I was looking for. The atmosphere at the front of the place is very nice. I would say it could have been better if there were more people, but oh well. I guess I went there during the off-season when CSU was not in session yet. It was surprisingly empty.  They have a good beer selection, and more importantly helpful and friendly bartenders. I will try to go to this place often."}
{"text":"I had a great Burger here, and the staff is top notch. You will love this place. Everything i have tried here so far has been great. Prices are good as well. Service couldnt be better."}
{"text":"The parking is cramped but the food inside makes up for it. Great burgers, brews, and curly fries! Open mic night is fun. Near CSU, so that's good maybe?"}
{"text":"It smelled!  And the bathrooms are far away.  And you have to order from the bar; no one will come to your table.    But great parking lot.  The tables are multiple but not good.  The food was good and very Cleveland: perogis, potato pancakes, not healthy but very good.  I would come back for a cold beer and the yummy food."}
{"text":"I heart this place. It's a dive but it's a dive I enjoy. It's away from downtown and parking is ample if there isn't anything crazy going on like the Cavaliers in the championship. I have yet to order food that I didn't like. My favorite is the steak salad. My suggestion is that the struggle with the cook of the steak is totally real so if you like a medium steak I suggest asking for a warmer cook because apparently medium here means rare-medium. If you like bleu cheese I suggest getting that with the salad. They have drink and/or food specials everyday so there's sure to be something to tickle your fancy."}
{"text":"Becky's may have a dive bar feel but it never disappoints.  The food is good for the price and the beer is cheap.  You will find a wide variety of people here and it has a very \"Cleveland\" vibe to it.  Whether it is for lunch or after work, Becky's is a reliable standby."}
{"text":"Came here with a few coworkers after a awork function.  I loved the private lot!  When you walk in, you immediately notice the cool, local vibe.    The rest rooms could use some remodeling & clean up.  We sampled a few appetisers & our service was great.    I don't live in the area, but would  go back!"}
{"text":"Went in for the first time yesterday and absolutely loved it. From the chill down to earth workers to the delish $1 tacos and the free beer you get from checking in.. What is there not to love. Definitely looking forward to coming again!"}
{"text":"Becky's is the friendliest neighborhood bar in Cleveland. I have been a loyal customer for YEARS. The staff is fast, friendly and completely unpretentious. The clientele is  a seamless blend of people of all ages, ethnicities and social standings drinking  harmoniously together like one big happy, intoxicated family!              There is a full menu of casual American fare, which is offered daily until 1am, and is very vegetarian and vegan friendly. Also, as the popularity of specialty beers grows, Becky's is responding with an increasing selection of draft and bottled beers to suit the more discriminating palates. Additionally, live music can now be heard several nights a week, Kareoke is a Saturday tradition and Sunday night open mic is gaining popularity and attracting a range of talented musicians. There is pool, darts, free parking and lots of seating inside. All pricing is very reasonable."}
{"text":"As a downtown resident and a student nearby, Becky's is a breath of fresh air amongst many of the other superficial and overpriced bars downtown.  It's atmosphere and patronage are real and down-to-earth.   $2 PBRs.  $1 off pitchers if you're a student (higher education has its perks). And food food served til close; none of that \"kitchen closes at 10pm\" B.S.  Speaking of the food, I think it's some of the most underrated food in Cleveland.  My friends all really enjoy the food there, and their menu is pretty big for a dive bar.  I can't get past their wings though. Something about wings at a dive bar - its nostalgic like mom's crusted PB&J.   And guess what (literally)... they have trivia on Thursday nights.    I would definitely go there before a concert at State Theater or Wolstein.  Or graduation. Or anything over near East 18th and Chester for that matter."}
{"text":"Best burgers in that area. The fries are always fresh and hot and the burgers could feed a family. The selection of drinks is great from ciders to beers to mixed drinks. It's parking lot is a bit shady at night so make sure to hide valuables in your car. I love how the bar is big so many people can sit and enjoy.."}
{"text":"Becky's is alright.  Its a cool college joint in downtown Cleveland near the CSU campus.  It has a good college joint feel about it, even with the policemens dining there.  The food hit the spot.  I had a tomato basil sandwhich on toasted sourdough.  It was not thick sourdough, but like sliced bread.  and tater tots.  mmm scrumptious."}
{"text":"It's a dive, but a nice dive. The scary bathrooms are quickly forgotten after you taste the incredible potato skins. I was in shock and they even say on a bed of real sliced homemade potato chips. Truly amazing. And the prices are super low. It started off about 330 very quiet. But by 5pm the place was full and people were really enjoying themselves.  The bartender gal was wearing a \"showyourtatas\" shirt and was getting some chuckles."}
{"text":"One of my new favorites. Cheap Labatts on draft and great bar food. Seems like Midtown is coming up and although Becky's seems like it been here forever it is part of the midtown rise. I really liked the roasted red pepper sandwich."}
{"text":"Becky's holds a special place in my heart. Cold beer and delicious food. Just a block or two from CSU's student center and comfort inn.  Been to Becky's about a million time and it keeps me coming back for more. It's the hole in the wall bar that will fill your stomach and your heart. It may not be the prettiest bar in town  but it certainly has the most character. Burgers are delicious and they definitely don't mess around with their pirogies!! Yum! Although I have to say, the grilled chicken salads are my all time favorite!! I could salivate at the thought of them! God bless Becky's and everyone that get to experience this gem."}
{"text":"Bad service. Majority of the tables in the establishment were dirty so my sisters and I decided to sit at the bar. The 1st bartender didn't have the best attitude. Our food took so long that we decided to take it to go. When our food came out no one went to get it for us and it sat there for an extra 10 minutes. We had to remind them to give us our food.   I'm only giving them to stars because my sister's really enjoyed their wings and burgers. My wings were - meh."}
{"text":"We were visiting Cleveland from CA and looking for a sports bar to watch the NBA playoff game and get dinner. Oh, add that I'm a vegetarian, and there's our world.  Well, we loved this place. We walked from our hotel. The staff was so friendly, the food was yummy, and there were several vegetarian options. It was a little awkward at first; we didn't know if it was open seating or not, but the super friendly bartender explained to order at the bar, sit anywhere, and just relax, so we did. Our food was delivered to the table we chose with a perfect view of the TV.  Oh, bonus -- they turned up the volume on the TV, so you could hear the game."}
{"text":"If you have a lot of time to waste, and who doesn't in Cleveland, then Becky's is the place you want to be waiting for a big fat burger. You will wait, and depending on how good the conversation is at your table, it will be worth the wait. The bigger question is whether it's worth the weight. Which is to say, you are going to bust a gut, clog an artery and catch a charley horse in your jaw muscles getting through a Becky's combo plate.  Serious, Big. Burgers. Massive. Onion. Rings.   And the bathroom's not scary. What more can you ask for?  Oh wait. You need to know more. Firstly, you can expect to be noshing around the likes of dudes who may or may not have had an honorable discharge from the Army. Not talking gunny, I'm talking grunt. Wear your red plaid or avoid eye contact if you're uncomfortable around hardhats, ex-cops and pipefitters.   Secondly, the darts wall looks serious. That's what you need to know."}
{"text":"I happen to be around looking for a place to eat and I spotted this place, not your ordinary place to eat  but they serve food.  As I walk in since I'm not a drinker they left me in the front ( I guess waiting to be waited on) so I asked ; where can I sit to eat, no I am not drinking, I'm  eating. They said walk towards the back . and that was it. After having the waiter passed me like 5 times, I got up to the bar and asked where can I placed my order, bartender: oh with me. So I placed my order.  Now follow me: I got two eggs on a plate, then 10 mins later I got the greasiest bacon ever, never got toast and I had to request the fries but by the time I got the fries I had to go. I ate plain eggs and drank cold coffee. NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Wow... Just read the other reviews and you will get the idea! Awesome beer! Great pretzels, cool location! We came on a Monday and it was a little slow but got some great information from the workers! Plan on coming back on a weekend!"}
{"text":"I use Becky's as a yardstick for other bars.  It's predictable, comfortable, and familiar, but without being too dull.    The food is surprisingly good, and actually fresh, which is a rarity when it comes to bars.  For a while about a year ago, the quality was so-so at best, but it's gotten much better.  I mostly go veg when I'm there, but one evening I decided to go after a steak instead, and found that they're surprisingly worthwhile.  They don't smother it in seasonings, and whoever's running the grill knows what he or she is doing.  Want a Pabst?  They've got that.  Want a craft beer?  Ditto.  Want to go write on the bathroom walls?  They're apparently pretty OK with that, given that there's what amounts to conversations in Sharpie going on in the men's room."}
{"text":"Bartender with ponytail was extremely rude. He told us to \"kiss him or get out\". We were looking forward to getting some drinks and just have a good time after the Cavs game, but I guess he had other plans.  One of the worst bars I've ever been to."}
{"text":"Great vibe. Super chill. Burger and pierogi was great! Ill be back every night! Ivy is great!!!"}
{"text":"A dive down the street from Cleveland State University. Can be fun if you go with friends. Otherwise its basically a run of the mill bar. If this is a bar for CSU students, then the 'students' inside looked pretty old.  Overwhelmingly men for some reason. The only girls there were with their male companions. One 'interesting' note: on the dartboard among the names listed was an 'Aryan warrior.' OK, if this bar accepts open displays of white supremacy, I think its safe to say not everyone will be welcome.  But the burgers are awesome."}
{"text":"Becky's is a pretty typical dive bar, but I would consider it on the more upscale side of dive bars.  They have a full service bar with beer on draft and loads of liquor all for reasonable prices.  We recently attended on a Friday evening and they did karaoke that started at 10:00 pm. so that was pretty fun since a few people in our group got up and sang.   It a pretty chill place where they do not play the music too loud so it is still possible to have conversations."}
{"text":"One of the most underrated bars in CLE. Located near CSU. Bar food is excellent and there are even legit vegetarian options. Great mix of people and the bar is well run. Small parking lot offers some free parking. I've always had a great time at Becky's."}
{"text":"Great dive bar.  Undergrad at CSU, we used to roll over here after SGA meetings and the beer and chicken wings flowed like water.  Well, the chicken wings didn't actually flow, but you get the idea.  The last time I was here, I couldn't drive myself home.  Sometimes it kind of sneaks up on you when your glass is never empty..."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood dive bar. Drinks are cheap, happy hour specials are cheaper and the bar food is grand. If you are looking for a fun dive bar and not super upity, this is the spot for you!"}
{"text":"Becky's is your local college watering hole. They have great food, great drinks , and atmosphere where you can enjoy good company with friends."}
{"text":"Becky's is a CSU bar with surprisingly good food. Burgers are really good and the turkey club is a good score. Happy hours usually draw a pretty good crowd too."}
{"text":"The place is very good the Philly is big with a great roll and peppers onions and lot's of cheese. Friendly staff and close to CSU. This will be a frequent stop with my CSU student. The I am told the wings were great!"}
{"text":"I love Becky's I used to come here all the time when I went to Cleveland State  great atmosphere great friendly people."}
{"text":"Every year my work throws a Christmas party and they love coming here for the after party. It has a little dance floor with a DJ on weekends, also boasts karaoke every other week. Free parking on the side, cheap booze, excellent tater tots AND if you check in on yelp you get a free coupon for free Labatt draft!!!! Now I like to come here after blowing a wad across the street at Hofbrahaus or if their lines are too long. This place is TOTES DIVEY so no need to dress to impress. Expect some fun people watching."}
