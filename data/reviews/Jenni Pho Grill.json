{"text":"Expensive compared to the other vietnamese restaurant nearby. The grill pork was salty, the rice was hard ro chew, undercooked. Not coming back.  Watch out if you dine more than 5 persons the restaurant will add 15% service in your bill , give them more tips or not it's up to you."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. People who came 10 minutes after us got their food and everything before we did. They don't refill your water and nor do they ask if everything is okay. Don't think I'm ever coming back to this place again. I used to love this place but not anymore."}
{"text":"After a high recommendation from a Vietnamese friend, I decided to try this place. I have my standby places and always open to try new ones. 

The place was nice - felt more pricier than a 6.99 or 7.99 entree place.  Service was a bit awkward a first, but never a strong suit I guess anywhere when it comes to PHO. We never went thirsty and our water glasses were always promptly filled. 

Broth was savory and not a shortage of meats. I ordered their signature and a friend ordered off the grill portion. The bowl was HUGE.  Although my bowl of Soup came our substantially earlier than my friends...always a pet peeve and makes it awkward amongst friends it was dang astute and enough to share. 

All acceptable until the bill came....ours totaled $17 bucks and change. \"Hannah\" came by and said that it was a 20.00 Min to use card....WHAT?!?!? I asked where the sign was and she said \" I am just doing my job\" as she flicked her ponytail. We scramble up $20.00 and left the balance of a 20.00 as a tip - sorry Waiter...Hannah was after all just doing her job. 

I left and asked where the sign was...Hannah swung that ponytail once more which set the tone for the entire evening and pointed to the sign. HAHAHAHAHAH it must be handwritten amongst other signage and in 12 point font!!!  I guess I should of read reviews further, apparently it's an issue for others. 

I rarely carry cash and don't like to be pressured to ordered more to get my bill over 20. Too many options out there, although the Pho was good, a side of Hannah's saucy attitude and no credit cards makes me not want to return."}
{"text":"The food was awesome and the service was prompt and friendly. As far as Pho goes this is the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"This pho restaurant is hands down the best in all of Las Vegas. The flavor is so consistent and the level of customer service is unsurpassed. The owner Jennifer is so sweet and makes sure all of her guests have the best time possible at her establishment."}
{"text":"This is the first time I have written a review about a restaurant. I have been to a lot of places with bad food; however the effort to write a review is daunting after already having a terrible meal. I woke up at 6 AM today to write this because I cannot contain my frustration. Of course, it is also because I semi recovered after a night of battling with my stomach after eating Jenni Pho's food. If i could give the place zero star, I would have. 
My friends and I came to eat at Jenni Pho because we wanted some pho before going out. The food portion was very big and the waiters were very nice. The environment seemed clean and nice. When the food came out, I tasted the liquid and the pho liquid was a bit sour. I order bun rieu oc myself and from the liquid, I know is 'one of the last bowls remaining' of an old pot. As an avid eater, I have a particular palette but not picky. We did not eat much since the food did not particularly taste good. The flavor was bland and it tasted pretty old. It is understandable that restaurants that open pass 1 AM is mostly for people who have been clubbing and want some food before heading home. The food does not need to be particularly tasty and I get that part. The result for eating several spoons of pho and bun rieu? One hour later, my stomach cramped up so bad as we were walking around the strip. My friends then started have similar symptoms and went straight the restroom. Our night was cut short because my stomach hurts so bad that I couldn't even walk properly. We did not get to go dance or even have a single drink. As a vietnamese, I am very disappointed and question the restaurant's ethic. After the food was cooked for several days (5-7+), you should either taste the food to make sure is still fresh or dispose of it. Feeding spoiled food to your customers while trying to maximizes profit is a terrible plan. I have travel to may places and eaten food from stalls without getting sick. If I am sick from eating food in a nice restaurant and is still laying in bed recovering on my vacation, this is unacceptable. Please be ethical and dispose your food when is spoiled. It really makes all the Vietnamese look bad because I know that we are not all money hungry and trying to maximize profit at the cost of people's health. 
FYI, if you have 'PHO' as part of the restaurant's name, make sure your PHO is at least fresh."}
{"text":"Customer Service is great. The food tastes amazing, especially for the prices and the decor is elegant and the setting is intimate and relaxing."}
{"text":"I eat here about once a week.  The pho is delicious and the broken rice dishes are all very good.  They make an excellent broth here.  Service here is great, especially from a young man called David.  He is fast, accurate and always happy.  I would recommend this place to anyone that feels looks good vietnamese food, even when its really late!"}
{"text":"Great interior, first open concept kitchen I've seen for a Vietnamese restaurant.  The soup just did not agree with my palette."}
{"text":"My new must-go place next time I am in town.  Friendly staffs, nice atmosphere, clean, excellent food.  

We went with a large group of 14 people(adults and kids).  It was our first time trying this place.  They set the tables for us very quickly and sat us down.

We ordered a few of their appetizers, all very good, the kids loved the wings that we had to order more.  Pork chop over rice which was very juicy vs other places are usually dried. The broth of the beef pho (the jenni pho) was very tasty too. 

Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Visited JenniPho Restaurant on Sunday May 1st with a friend for lunch and we were amazed with the welcoming from Jenni and her team. The waitress suggested some of their specials as well as answered all our questions. I had the Dancing beef , real tender  and flavorful. My friend had the shrimp pho soup and he said it was amazing food( He is very picky with food). We were in town in a conference from Phoenix - Arizona. I go often to Las Vegas for work. I recommend this restaurant very much. You will enjoy the great food they have !"}
{"text":"First off, I'm Viet and the food here is legit.  I don't understand all the bad reviews, like seriously?  If you're giving a 1 star because you were \"expecting\" a bigger portion, you've got a serious problem and probably shouldn't be yelping.

Alright - on to the actual review :)

We live in NYC and was in Vegas for a bachelorette.  We can't get good Viet food back home so we decided to leave the strip to get our fix at Jenni Pho Grill.  We've been at the other location and the bun bo hue and pho was amazing.  I ordered the bun rieu here and it was exactly how my mom makes it.  The broth was fragrant and tasty, there was a perfect combination of noodle to crab meat to broth. I asked them for a side of shrimp paste because I'm Viet like that and they brought me more than enough...yumm!!  I was a happy camper and so were my gals.  

The service: the owner Jenni is super friendly and the staff did come by several times to check up on us. It was also nice to be able to speak in Vietnamese with the waitress.  Will definitely be back on my next LV trip!"}
{"text":"I love how clean this place is!  It's one of the first pho places that I have been to that takes pride in their sanitation and keeps their restaurant clean.  I also love their bun bo hue & bun rieu.  My husband and I always make sure we make a stop here or their other location on Rainbow everytime we visit Vegas!  Thanks Jennipho for your restaurant's good food and service too!"}
{"text":"I was in town for my birthday, I had a couple drinks, and I was craving pho. I was driving around town & I saw jenni pho grill and decided to try it out & it was one of my best decision!!! The food & the service were great!!! The pho tasted like no other.
I will for sure come back next time when I'm in town ."}
{"text":"We like the soup but service is always a little slow. But the make your own soup choice is nice for picky eaters"}
{"text":"Dinner on a Friday night and there were only 2 other sets of diners.
Nice decor and open kitchen view with two LATINO chefs.  Waitress, bus girl were also not from Vietnam.  No diners from Vietnam.  Draw your own conclusions but my wife and I ordered their \"dancing beef\" and split it between us, plus tea and bowl of rice that cost over $21.  There was over a half of the dish left (beef tasted mildly like liver) and we usually take home any left overs but not this time.  Owner not overseeing his place indicates how much interest he must have.  Good location. Will not return when there are so many other choices nearby with better food."}
{"text":"Took a quick trip to jenni pho with a date. And everything was phenomenal.  Great food great service highly recommended"}
{"text":"How long does it take to soak noodle in the hot water and pour a scoop of broth over it?  If you want to wait over half hour after we ordered and had some items served, come to Jenni's Pho and Grill.  For Jenni's incompetent crew, it took over half and hour between serving spring rolls and pho!  It wasn't busy, just a bunch of clueless and inefficient young staff standing around.  To add insult to injury, they charged me $1 for extra onion without telling me.  Wtf.  After the long wait, they still got the order wrong.  I want the tai meat separate but they put it inside, essentially over cooked to my liking.  Dangit.  

Go some where else if you want pho.  There are plenty of other pho shop who will try harder to earn your money.  

0* for staff and lack of service, slow and clueless in how to operate in the food industry.
1* is generous for the overall rating.

Terrible ice coffee!  Kim Long down the street is much better, fast and attentive service.

What a terrible way to end our otherwise awesome LV trip."}
{"text":"This place.... where to begin.
 First off, my lady and I saw this place and decided to stop there because our normal pho spot had a line out the door. We were greeted to whom I'd assume was the owner of the establishment. She was a very nice, slightly older woman. My lady and I were seated right away by the nice lady. 

About 10mins of waiting, this older gentleman comes to take our order. My lady orders her food and hot green tea and water, but not before placing an order for potstickers. He takes my pho order with water, but he can't seem to get away fast enough. 10 more mins of waiting a young waiter comes to the table with the potstickers but no water or tea. My lady asked for a green tea smoothie since they forgot our beverages. They came back to inform us they were out of the Matcha green tea smoothie, So my lady asks for the peach smoothie then. 5mins later they comeback and say they have no more peach smoothie. So she asks if they have the mango smoothie and the waters we ordered at the start and I slide a diet coke order in there at this time. The gentleman comes back with the smoothie and waters but not my my soda.. Innocent mistake. I taste the potstickers and they are cooked but cold which makes me wonder how long they were out and if they were from an order that was sent back or changed. Maybe that's why they got to the table so quick. 

Our food gets to the table along with my diet coke. I have the beefball pho which taste pretty good. My lady has the beefball pho with added steak which also taste pretty good. We are eating and talking, our drinks are empty for about 10mins and no waiter to be found. Im looking around and notice the place isn't to packed. So where is the service?! About 20mins into the drink wait the nice lady who greeted us sat a couple tables away looks over and sees our drinks empty and tells one of the waiters to fill our drinks. Damn, it takes the head cheese cracking the whip to get some water refill and order another drink.

Oh and they charge for everything even if you get water and say \"no ice please.\" Yeah, they charge you for the \"no ice.\"

The pho I'd rate it a 2 ...maybe..meaning it would do in a pinch, but the service  F-ing sucked. Negitive rating if I could for service. 

Will not return and do not/will not recommend."}
{"text":"Worst service ever I had at las vegas restaurant.
Wiaited over one hour for the simple pho and does not even apologize."}
{"text":"Jenni Pho is my favorite pho spot to go to...it's always clean...the service is always on point...the food is good...and Jenni (when she's there) always welcomes every person that walks thru the door IF she's out front & not prepping food in the back! Yes she does work herself!
I've been to the Rainbow location when it first opened as well as the Spring Mtn one & I've never had any problems at either location! EVERRRR!
I even recommended this place to a lot of friends & they STILL frequent BOTH of her locations!
I highly recommend this place & always will!"}
{"text":"we were on spring mountain road in the mood for pho and this was not a good choice at all. i ordered the rare steak pho - the meat was overcooked and the soup was so bland. i have had my fair share of good pho in the SGV, CA and the food here did not even come close. needless to say i will not be visiting jenni again."}
{"text":"Pros:

Pho was good
Rice dish was good

Cons:
Service was ok. 
A bit greasy.
Bake egg was salty"}
{"text":"This is my frst time here, just wanted to try something new since my usual pgo place was packed! But this will be the frst and only time here. 

I ordered spring roll, and it was the worst spring roll ever! Theres only.shrimp, vege, and vermicelli in the spring roll. No meat at all... all the pho places that Ive been to has pork inside. The spring roll is just so plain, no taste at all....

Then I had creat my own pho and asked for 2 orders of beef ball. When I got my food, there was only 3/4 of a whole beef ball. I asked the server how many beef ball in one order and she just replied \"let me check\". Then she brings over another small bowl of beel ball with one whole cut beef ball inside... I guess the service is not too bad until the time when I pay. I asked for the check, placed my money on the table for a good 10mins. No one came over to pick it up until I raised my hand. The funniest thing is when the server came, she asked \"do you need change?\"  NO DUH! It was a $30 meal, I put $40 down, you expect me to give you $10 tip with this? 

But one thing I had to mention was the pho was pretty big portion and decent taste..."}
{"text":"I always order the exact same items whenever I eat here. They're usually on point on things and I must say, this place to my opinion? Has the best phö in town hands down!! 
Some place should take notes on how to do,  make phö!  From the broth itself. It's just so earthy and savory... this place is by far my favorite place to get a late night grub for phö?  Or just to hang with fellow chefs in town..."}
{"text":"This place has bad service. Asian restaurants in Vegas outside of the casino tends to have bad service, but this is by far the worse. The ambiance isn't bad, but hire some waiters. Food was very average. No need for reservation. This place is a ghost town. Lunch time and no one is here."}
{"text":"P1 Dac Biet is pretty good. Skip the boba milk teas because they are very bland, but other than that this place is decent."}
{"text":"FLAVOR, FLAVOR, FLAVOR!  Decorative interior.  Relaxing environment.  Great service.

Not sure why this place only has 3 stars... should be pushing 4.5 IMO.

Came with three others on a rainy Sunday afternoon, what else sounds better on a rainy day?! Especially in Vegas!

Great potstickers.  Perfect Vietnamese egg rolls.  DELICIOUS PHO!  You know it's bomb when you're super thirsty a couple hours later (fair warning).

The interior design of the restaurant is classy, much nicer than your typical Pho restaurants.  You can see into the kitchen through their glass wall and the kitchen appears to be in immaculate condition, so you know cleanliness is one of their priorities.  That right there makes me feel much more comfortable.

The server was very attentive to us the entire time we were there and made sure we had everything.  

Definitely one of my new favorite places. I'll be back again in the near future!"}
{"text":"Ate here once and never returned! Tourist and people who don't know what vietnamese food is suppose to taste like might enjoy their food here.

Writing a review about this now because it was on dirty dining! 

How can you go from 44 demerits to 6 the next day? Lies! These ppl are still picking their nose and serving you food. Sick and lazy bastards.


\"The other closure coming in with 44 demerits is Jenni Pho on Spring Mountain. The Vietnamese restaurant was shut down due to excessive and repeat violations and gross, unsanitary conditions.

Multiple foods were in the temperature danger zone including beef, shrimp, tripe, meatballs and tofu.

There was expired food, from two weeks to two months old. Prep tables were excessively dirty. Food was uncovered and unlabeled.

There was food debris on the can opener and knives, and small flying insects in the kitchen.\""}
{"text":"Food was average, No taste.  Services were literally hideous & horrifying.  They hired homeless Bums in this place.  Servers seemed lazy, uneducated, can hardly understand the English language, had poor mannerisms & probably still lives with mommy & daddy.  Of course, because their paychecks are so tiny.  Restaurant was almost empty at Prime lunch time & had a weird foul smell throughout the restaurant.  We left without leaving a penny for tip.  If we could sue them, we would.  Never going back.  Place will be Out of business soon.  Save yourselves from a Horrific dining experience.  DO NOT go here.  Thank you."}
{"text":"We were seated really fast. But after that it took ten minutes for our Waiter to ask for our drinks and order.  Another ten minutes to get our waters.  Our food was made fast but not the best I have had.  We got our food first then when we were about done eating is when we got our drinks.  Then we were done eating for about 20 minutes before we got our check!!!!

Overall We felt unimportant and more of a bother"}
{"text":"I usually don't write a reviewed but this place has the worst service. Just came here with my wife , 4 yrs old son and 9 months daughter. We wait over 10 minutes and flag at least 3 waiters to get some water at least. They all said one minutes and never came back. My son started acting up after waiting so long so we got up and just left. If you have young kids they careless.  WOULDN'T RECOMMEND TO ANYONE WITH KIDs!!!"}
{"text":"The service here has to be the worse service Ive experience. The waiter disregarded our table as he greeted others who were sat after us. As we asked for service, the waiter looked at us and just walked away. He didnt issue any apology of any sort.  They were busy and i just dont understand why that is. Food was subpar at best and service was awful. I would recommend pho kim long right down the street"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best pho in Vegas! Great service, great location, nice decor comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"A couple of days ago my friends and I were craving vietnamese food and came across Jenni Pho. From the very beginning to end, the server was very nice and friendly. The pho that I ordered was really good. The broth wasn't salty, it was just perfect. However I'm giving only 4 stars because I feel like they should have more in their menu. But all in all it was really great!"}
{"text":"This place has a very generous serving. The broth was delicious (I got the pho ga). Service was quick, and the environment was very relaxing."}
{"text":"We almost didn't eat here. Was looking for a quick place to eat and saw a \"buffet\" thinking it was quick. But it was a raw bar and had to cook stuff ourselves but didn't have time. So we ended up going next door. Nothing impressive, typical asian food restaurant  decor, maybe even a little \"Hole in the wall\" type. I wasn't excited about eating here but we were pressed for time. Glad we stayed! I ordered beef pho and my husband ordered a grilled meat dish. The raw veggies to be added to the soup were so fresh and crisp The bowl was huge, enough to feed 2 people for 8.95! The broth alone was excellent. Very flavorful on its own, but made even better with the meat. Would have liked to add more meat, but the price was appropriate. This place is a solid 4 stars but I gave it 5 because others have it underrated on Yelp."}
{"text":"Great Vermicelli bowl. Clean and comfortable restaurant with open kitchen. 

Not sure you will find better Vietnamese food in the area."}
{"text":"Pho here is really good and the egg rolls are to die for,  very good customer service. Will continue coming time and time again."}
{"text":"Good pho , good service but $20 CC minimum is ridiculous"}
{"text":"Bigger fan here than I am of the one in the Southwest.  The servers here tend to pay attention to your order and what it is that you say.  If you tell them that you have an allergy to a food item, they will not put it in your food.  Far better staff here than their sister restaurant Jenni Pho."}
{"text":"My husband and I were shopping at Macy's Furniture Store and on the spur of the moment he suggested we stop at Jenni Pho Grill and try the PHO. After living here for 18 years, we had pretty much given up finding a good Vietnamese restaurant. But Jenni Pho did not disappoint - in fact, it was perfect. From the minute we walked in and were greeted with a very warm and friendly hello to the excellent service and wonderful food our experience was superb. Instead of the PHO I had the sour soup (I can't remember the Vietnamese Name) and my husband had the chicken rice dish. Both were amazing. I am still craving the soup and will definitely be back for more. This would make a good take out dish to eat at home later - Our order was so large we took it home for leftovers and ate for the next two days (it kept getting tastier every day). OMG Jenny it's wonderful!

Jennifer the owner stopped by and introduced herself while we were dining. She is a lovely and charming hostess and that extra interest was very pleasing.

If you're looking for the best Vietnamese dining try this restaurant."}
{"text":"I came here on a family vacation and we wanted viet food. This restaurant is pretty good but a little pricey compared to other places. I got the Bun Cha Gio and I thought it was very good I also ordered the Thai tea and it's not as good like official boba stores but it's decent for a restaurant made drink."}
{"text":"Not happy. We went there by default because the korean bbq next door was closed before the time posted. We just came off the airplane and was hungry. We order the pho and it didn't taste like pho. None of the aroma smell of pho. None of us finish the bowls. It just wasn't pho. It was noodle, meat and brown broth. The fixing came out and we thought it was weird the bean sprout was cooked. Usually restaurant cook them to save them from going bad. The basil leaves were old and tiny.  The waiter didnt fill our water. The waiter just took our order, brought it out and never came back to check on us. It took him awhile to remember to come back to get our order. He There's plenty of other pho places on spring mountain. This place lost all hope for a good bowl of pho place in vegas.
Also recommendation, wait staff should be more friendly and greet us and check on us instead of disappearing"}
{"text":"Great place for Pho on the south west side. Staff is always friendly and food is always on point. They also do a buy one get one on their delicious pot stickers when you dine in.

Only down fall is they ONLY take cash. There is a ATM machine inside but still inconvenient. Not to big of a deal. Still keeps me coming back"}
{"text":"Server: Heily
Mature Asian woman who actually smiles!
A+

My first time dining here was wonderful. 

Heily is very kind and attentive. 

Our table ordered a good portion of the menu and the one thing that stood out is that the beef is exquisite (tender/pink)...oddly too perfect. 

I needed it to be a bit on the medium well because of my poor preference for how I need to eat firmer meat. Lol. 

When I brought this to Heily's attention...she knew exactly how I felt. 

I appreciated the fact she was capable of empathizing with me.  

The food and service were excellent. 

Thank you for the meal!"}
{"text":"We went once and had awesome food and equally good service. The last time that we went was awful. It seems like the staff has a lot of turnover because I did not recognize any of the workers. When we walked in, the neck tattooed host was scratching his crotch and rubbing his face. We were very, very hungry and figured that since he wasn't a cook, we would reluctantly let it go. I explained to him my special dietary needs and asked him if there were any dishes that they could customize for me. He went to the kitchen and quickly came back with a \"no\" answer. The host did not care to work with me; their food is prepared a certain way and that was that. So, we left."}
{"text":"Quick service.  A good set of spring rolls with peanut sauce, and a Jenni Pho.  Exactly what I was looking for, but didn't blow me away.  Would come back!"}
{"text":"Honestly I'm a huge foodie and ESPECIALLY when it comes to pho. Its my favorite food in the whole world and have tried in vegas, cali and even utah haha. Anywhere I can get my hands on pho. I can't recommend jenni pho enough. Clean enviornment and the food is of top quality. I always get the vegan pho with extra chicken. Have even converted people from the distasteful place that is pho kim long and when you go to jenni pho especially at night when the owner jenni is there, youll be beyond taken care of. The food is tasteful, pho is flavorful, clean and not greasy like other places. Even the other dishes like the grilled pork skewers with rice is so good!  Usually i dont venture out but jenni doesnt let you down lol come through and you wont be disappointed"}
{"text":"I really like this place when we visited Vegas last time. It was their grand opening, and so we got a 10% off discount for life! The place is very clean, and nicely decorated. I had the Pho, and it's one of the best in Vegas (even better than Pho #1). I love their jelly fruit drink...it's buy 2 get 1 free, and it was really good. The prices are on the low side, compare to other restaurants like Pho Kim Long.

So far, I give this place a 5 star, because of excellent authentic Vietnamese food, great service, and super clean and nice decor. I have only been here once though, so I will update if this changes."}
{"text":"The food here is great! It opens late at night, which makes the best late night meal. The servers were nice and have a wide selection of Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"Was in Vegas this past weekend and some friends recommended JenniPHO in Chinatown...

First I want everyone to know that I've used Yelp many times before to find a good spot to eat in Vegas, and the last few times i was really let down...

For example:

Stay away from PHO KIN DO!!!! They have good ratings but the food is horrible!!!

Now Back to Jenni-PHO, by far the cleanest and best service I've had in Las Vegas.. I'm from So Cal, so I'm a Pho connoisseur \"at least I think so\"... and this place was delicious!!! Service was great and the Pho was super tasty.. it had a different aroma to it, not too sweet or salty... you just HAVE to try it... its BOMB!!!! 

Don't need to order a large cause they only have one size, and it's a BIG bowl.

Vegetables were really fresh... don't think I've seen bean sprouts that fresh before... 

I started with Spring Rolls and Egg Rolls.... 

Spring rolls were really crisp and fresh, good portion of meat and veggies... Peanut Sauce was tasty and original too... egg rolls were fresh and crispy too...

I had the Pho with Rare Steak and Tendon, again soup was hot and tasty...  meat was fresh and i DRANK ALL THE SOUP!!!! \"I don't do that often\" =D

Finished it off with a JenniPHO Dessert... that was super good too... not sure what it was but it was Green and my GF was in love with it...

The Decor was really cool... you can see right into the kitchen and the place was spotless.. very hip and modern...

Wait staff was very attentive and I never had to ask for my water to be filled... Good Job guys... I love's my water after I long night of DRINKING!!!!!

Overall, I think I've found my go to place in Vegas... Goodbye Pho Kim Long and all you others that MSG ME out every time I go... HELLO JENNI-PHO!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Not sure where these 5-stars come from. This place isn't even run by Vietnamese people and nobody speaks the language. The servers don't know the name of the dish they're bringing out.

The one star because the Pho soup is way bland. It is decently hot, but no flavor. Beef is dry and tasteless, like sand paper.

Don't be fooled by the shill ratings. 

Sigh, my search for a good Pho place in Vegas continues..."}
{"text":"JenniPho you're always my cure to hangovers in Vegas, and once again you saved my life after a night of wild fun at XS ringing in the New Year.   Jenni-Pho always and forever the place to get your hangover cure fixings!"}
{"text":"I have tried many pho restaurants in the valley and every time I try a new place I am dissapointed, because they don't match up to Jenni Pho. The restaurant itself has an amazing smell to it... that I can't quite put my finger too but I love it! I always get the Pho Tai Nam. I love it! The broth has so much flavor to it. One of my favorite restaurants in Vegas."}
{"text":"We just finished eating here and have been here a few times. We also know that these folks, for whatever reason don't except cards! This time we ate here, I miscalculated how much cash I had and had to use that stupid ATM machine to take out cash with a $3 charge for the machine and a $2.50 charge from my bank!!!

I gave two stars because the food is ok but i'm done with this place after that bullshxt ATM fee crap. I also believe they own the ATM machine and use that as a form of making more $$. What these morons don't realize is that no matter how good the food, people don't like being ripped off!!!

This is the last time i'll ever eat here! Now they can shove that ATM up their axxes!!!"}
{"text":"It's good, not great. Food wasn't authentic as I thought it would be. The taste of the food is as if it lost its culture. Service wasn't really there; Just took our orders forgot a few things, dropped off food and only checked up on us once everything was finished."}
{"text":"The food is good.....except for 

1.  when we were paying at the cashier, saw the server putting together the vegetables for pho and touching her hair at the same time.  We told the cashier but he didn't seem interested on what we are saying.  

2.  They said 20 minutes wait for boba but we never received it.  The server never came back to let us know what happened.

3.  After we got our food, nobody came back to check on us to see if we are doing fine or if we needed anything.

We won't come back....and DO NOT RECOMMEND this place for SANITARY reason...."}
{"text":"Very disappointing, service was very slow, waiter did not come to refill drinks, my wife's pho came out lukewarm. I ordered a chef's special, flavorless bowl of noodles and floating pieces of tofu. Waiters were polite though, from what little we seen of him."}
{"text":"Walking into Jennies Pho, it is very presentable and modern. Very clean restaurant. The service is very attentive and listening, but the food is where it dips a little under. Their pho lives up to the other reviews, the broth is very bland! The chicken wings also have no flavor and is tasteless. Good service, sub-par food."}
{"text":"Came here last year and it was amazing.  I can't say it was the same during this visit. Pho LOST ITS FLAVOR! I had to ask for cilantro, but that didn't help. Service was average. With the other pho restaurants to try in the district, I probably won't come back."}
{"text":"This should be NO stars!!!  We ordered our food and begin eating.  My friend went to the bathroom and when he came back, he said the cook was doing #2, flushes the toilet, walks out without washing his hands.  Be aware!!!  Disgusted about the situation, we ask for the check.  The waiter notices we hardly ate and asks if everything was okay.  We explained the situation and he just Oh
Sorry.  We also found a piece of plastic in our soup.  What a waste of time.  The messed up part is that we paid for the lunch.  Never again.  You have been warned!!!"}
{"text":"This is by far one of the best Vietnamese restaurants that I've been to with my boyfriend. Great customer service, nice servers, good food, good portion, beautiful environment. We came from Houston, TX to try this well talked about place and we both LOVE it. It's unacceptable to not stop by here while in town! My boyfriend is a pho-natic and he says Jennipho has not only met his expectations but exceeded them!"}
{"text":"Great food and good service. I have been to both locations, but i prefer Rainbow even though its a farther drive for me. The quality has always been good and the food is better than any of the other dives like pho so 1."}
{"text":"Clean restaurant,  clean kitchen, open glass kitchen,  you can actually see inside. You can see the cooks whipping up your pho.  This place is so clean. All and I do mean all pho places smell like someone spilled the fish sauce and spread it around the restaurant with a dirty mop.  Not Jenni-pho,  it's so clean,  I love it."}
{"text":"Food is good but what keeps me coming back the service here is way better the pho Kim long and pho so 1 and its not all always as packed either"}
{"text":"Called ahead for a pickup order. Ordered Vermicelli noodles with shrimp, pork, and egg roll. My order was ready promptly. Pork cooked and marinated perfectly. Shrimp was a little bit overcooked and the egg roll was not as crispy as when dining in. I guess I had to eat there in order to taste the freshness. The vegetables were very fresh tho. Overall, JEnni pho is a good restaurant that satisfied my hunger."}
{"text":"Thia was our first time here. We each got a different bowl.  Shrimp bowl and a beef bowl. Both were good. Just wish there were more vegetables in the soups.    Not sure if that was normal to lack vegetables.  There were at least lots of bean sprouts and jalapenos.

The appetizer sampler was good to try especially if you could not make up your mind on which one to select. We may eat here again when visiting las vegas unless we find a better place. Keep in mind we ended uo here because it was Christmas eve and it was one of the few restraunts open after midnight in the area. Also we wanted to try something different. 

Our server Andrew was helpful and nice."}
{"text":"Jenni Jenni, I got your number.
I've been trying to try your Pho for a long time now but Sora is always right by you giving me that jealous look and I'm just trying to avoid some drama! You have been seducing me for too long now and finally I couldn't resist and gave up to your temptation.
I had the seafood Pho, the broth was light and flavorful and it had plenty of seafood in it, I added the extra vegetables that came on the side and it added a crisp touch to the soup. The bowl was big enough to make it a complete meal by the time I was done I was full and satisfied, all I needed was a nice cigar but had to settle with a Thai tea which it was also very good.
Jenni I will keep you on my list Pho emergencies, I'm so glad I found you. I love that you are available for me very late at nite. (10am - 6am) I can always stop and see you when I'm out drinking late with boys and after Sora had gone to sleep.  XOXO"}
{"text":"Came here December 28. I understand it's busy due to the holidays and all, but i was pretty disappointed. Waited about half an hour to be seated...8 of us, 4 young children... Saw a group of about ten people walk in, walk to the back and seat themselves after one member gave the owner a nice hug. Finally sat down... 30 seconds later, server wanted to take our orders... Told him we needed minute... Waited forever for him to come back, ordered. Poor prefer included three phos with no onion. After waiting another 20 minutes one of our party asked where the heck was our food??! A server asked, \"no onions, right?\" \"That's right. Three with NO onions.\" 7 minutes later, half our phos come out.... the three non onions had to wait another 7 minutes...
And it had plenty of onions on top and inside when it finally did decide to make an appearance. Wow. So no tip, but i give a few stars because the pho itself was pretty good, the server was friendly and possibly sincere enough and the owner offered to give a small discount after our complaint. But, for sure NOT returning.... At least not during any holiday... I could be more forgiving because we had to wait a long time (left the restaurant two hours later), but on top of the loooooong wait, they messed up our order after double checking it???!!!! So can't give a great review! Sorry Jenni!
PS. What is up with the women's restroom??! One door had no lock, the other one you had to lift the door to lock!! Heard a lot of angry ladies...."}
{"text":"Went here in a recommendation,  portions and service were great, pho soup base a little sweet."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Not worth the wait. Two of the people on my table got their food 20 mins before the rest of us did so while my brother and i waited for out food my mom and bf were basically done with their food. In my opinion all of the food should come all at the same time, not at 20 minute intervals. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Ordered Pho.  They got wrong noodle in.
Asked to fix it they brought it back with added proper noodle. Took 15 mins
Since there wasn't enough soup asked to fix it. Took 15 min again.  Needless to say the noodle kinda looked funny by the time we got to it.
As we got the bill... they charged for extra noodle and soup? WTF?
BELOW AVERAGE ASIAN RESTAURANT SERVICE.
Never ever."}
{"text":"New pho place located in Chinatown, next to Sura KBBQ in the same area as the Macy's Home Department Store. Well not really new, its a new branch of the one off of Ranbow and Robindale. Opened really recently, there was a special for free food. Of course who can say no to free? I've tried the first location before and wasnt really impressed but was willing to try again. I had tried the Pho Dac Biet there before. 

Came here on a Tuesday Night, before it opened at 5. Got \"in line\" with the few people who were waiting there too for opening. By the time place opened, there was a snake that led into the parking lot. The restaurant was designed almost 1/2 kitchen with open viewing (large windows) and the dining area. 

Service was pretty good. Fast and quick. 

The special was allowed either Pho Dac Biet (Special combination beef noodle soup), Bun Bo Hue (their pork based noodle soup), or the Com Suon (broken rice plate with pork chop), as well as thai tea. 

First time i came here, i got the Bun Bo Hue (because i had tried the Pho Dac Biet before at the other location), and my other friend got the Pho Dac Biet. Thai tea came pretty fast, as well as the food. Presentation wise, not bad. Flavor, average. I wouldnt say its the best but its not bad. I had a party of 3, anotehr friend had gotten the same item as me. The different sizes of the pork feet we had gotten was different. Mine was considerably smaller compared to hers. Luckily she didnt eat pork, so i got to eat it all. It was tender and not hard to eat. Flavor was decent. Nothing too special. Not really flavorful, but not bland either. Couldn't really tell if it was legit broth or MSG.  Amount of food, given per portion, was a little smaller than i had been used to, at for example Pho So 1. 

Next day, we had came here again for lunch. Wait wasnt that bad. Maybe 1/2 an hour considering peak lunch time and it was during this free food special. This visit, i had gotten the Com Suon. Came with two pork chops on top of the broken rice, slices of cucumber and tomato, with a side of the fish sauce. The rice was plain. Little if any flavoring at all. Added some of the fish sauce to compensate. The pork chops were pretty tender. Flavored pretty good. Bone in so be careful ! 

As i had said before, this was a special they were running for i guess the grand opening of the restaurant, for marketing purposes probably. Portion size and item availability may be a bit different when its operating normally. I hope their broken rice has more stuff, otehrwise, this is definitely not a place id go for that. 

Some older gen viet people like this place more compared to other vietnamese restaurants. For me, it was ok. Not the best, probably prefer Pho So 1 or Pho Saigon 8 more if i wanted Pho. 

OH ! SIDE NOTE ! I am not sure if they implemented this at this new location but at the other location, it is CASH ONLY. They may or already have implemented this so be careful, otehrwise you are going have to run to a bank or maybe use the ATM machine they may have on site."}
{"text":"Food here is AMAZINGGGG!!!!!! Today I tried Bo Kho and the flavor is so rich -- the beef is so tender and perfectly cooked, the carrots and daikon absorbs all the flavor from the delicious broth and melts in your mouth. Service is GREAT the staff is very friendly and helpful. I always have to stop by Jenni Ph everytime I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"This was the most horrible experience. I am an avid restaurant goer and haven't had a BAD experience in a very long time, until now. We finished our meal. Waiter never checked on us mid way.  At the end, I had to go up to the desk and ask for the check. Took us 1 hr to cash out. No Rhyme or reason - we were not a bothersome table. My family of four ate, didn't ask for anything. We told the waiter at the beginning of our order that we needed Spring Rolls at the end. We finished our meal for a good 15 minutes before I had to walk up there myself.  Why did it take us 1 hour to cash out?  Because they suck at telling us our additional to go order of an appetizer was too hard to fulfill because they are out of spring rolls.

That's just dumb. One hour to cash out. Very poor service. The food was good. Average good food. But I will never come back to Jenni Pho again. I don't care how \"creative\" that name sounds."}
{"text":"Not much to say. Came here after the club and I wasn't impressed at all. Luckily, I was hungry."}
{"text":"Been here many times before, but the quality of the food and the service has declined. Waited 10 minutes until I finally had to get up and ask for someone to take my order...typical I guess for an Asian resturant. When he finally came to take our order he had an attitude. Bad business...will be my last time here. Too bad because the owners are really nice."}
{"text":"Came in and waited for more than 20 mins for a waiter to come by and ask what we want to eat and the restaurant isn't even busy."}
{"text":"I took my kids Here and the service was extremely poor. We waited 40 minutes at our table and the server never even came to take our order! We finally had to just go to another restaurant!"}
{"text":"Came in January 1, 2014. New Year and the place was pack. Service is decent since there are few staff or waiter to cater the customer. Food is excellent and their prices is about right."}
{"text":"Went here couple months ago but forgot to finish my review draft. There was one waiter who had a staring problem. Kept telling one of the waitresses to look at me and when she couldn't see me he dragged her in front of me and told her to look. It was rude and made me feel a bit uncomfortable. Parties of 6 or more will be charged 18% gratuity and food was okay, nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"I've been going to Jenni pho ever since I was in high school. (Started at the Rainbow location) So about 6 years. And this place always has the best pho guaranteed. Always hot and fresh and delicious, and Jenni always hires the most reliable servers. They're always super friendly, and give their best service. I will never stop coming to this place, NEVER! Definitely in my tops favorite restaurants in Las Vegas, highly recommend this place to anyone craving some pho or vermicelli bowls!

And I also want to add how amazing Jenni is. Hard worker but she always makes time to make her customers feel welcomed and enjoy their experience eating here. It's amazing to see her business taking off since she only started off at the Rainbow, and the Spring Mountain location is such a success! Ever rarely do you see an owner with such love and passion for their business. Love it here!"}
{"text":"Service was very poor, servers didn't know what they were doing. Dropping everything, we have been sitting for half an hour and still our food has not come out yet. Food is not all that great either. Well not worth my time in Vegas."}
{"text":"I prefer Pho So 1 for a late night Pho or Pho Kim Long. If only Saigon 8 was open for late night, that's my Pho of choice but I decided to come try this place out for the second time. The first experience wasn't bad at all here. This time around I probably wouldn't go back. It wasn't the food it was the customer service. I had to ask a couple times for my water to be refilled and I got the impression I was bothering them too much to do their job and it wasn't busy at all. There were 4 other tables and over staffed. The big issue was my change. My bill was $19.92. I gave them a $20 and I stood there waiting for my change. He looked at me and asked if there was anything he can help me with and I asked for my change. Then he told me \"it's only $.08\". As rude as it may seem but I told him \"My change is my change, I don't care if it's a Penny and there's a possibility I might just let you keep it. It's the gesture of actually giving me my change and don't be rude about it either saying it's only $.08\" Then he told me to wait for the change as he closed the drawer and cashed out another tables bill. Working in the restaurant industry I'm usually a good tipper. I already was set to leave $5 but I left them $2.08. I was about to just leave them $.08."}
{"text":"My family was in town. They want  to eat pho. Everywhere was busy when we got there and we didn't want to wait. So we figure to give Jennipho on spring Mt a try. We heard stories, we're not sure but we went anyways because everyone was hungry. When we got there, we got seated in less than 10 min. We order mostly pho and a few rice plates (grilled pork). We were surprised that their food was really tasty especially their pho. It was different for other pho place. My family was very happy. Their open kitchen was impressing. Their staffs are quite nice."}
{"text":"This place is nice and clean. Very polite workers. Fast cooks. And a great atmosphere overall. The broth is good and the rice plates are great as well. Definetely a place for lunch"}
{"text":"Generally, if you're going to put a specific food in your restaurant name, I expect that dish to be your specialty. Sadly, at Jenni Pho, I found that the pho wasn't particularly impressive. 

Ordered the custom bowl with tripe, flank, and meatballs, and though the portion was large and noodles were plentiful, the broth itself was lackluster- not packed with flavor and earthiness as expected, given the process and ingredients it takes to make. Much doctoring was needed with the herbs and sauces at the table to make it palatable, and even then it was underwhelming.

But the vermicelli pork bowl knocked it out of the park. Loved the plentiful portion of pork, with just the right bit of char to add flavor, tons of noodles and fresh herbs and vegetables. It was essentially a noodle salad, dressed with fish sauce, and deliciously so. Would come back for this dish.

Service, as I've come to expect at pho joints, was nearly nonexistent. Placed our order, got our food, and never saw the guy again. That being said, they seem to be well-staffed and had several guys working in the open-plan kitchen: loved being able to watch what was going on, and appreciated that the kitchen (and windows peering into it) were so very clean!"}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place out ever since I read Yelp's \"New Business Openings in Las Vegas\" section. I already had lunch though at the restaurant next door, but I decided to just pop on in and order some Pho to go. The staff here was very friendly and just real welcoming even though I wasn't sticking around to dine there. Offered me a drink while I waited too.
  
From my vantage point sitting in the waiting area which is partitioned off, I can see the dining area is fairly large and spacious with marble tabletops and wicker chairs that either seats 4 or tables that seat 6. The overhead lighting caught my eye, such fancy looking chandeliers.  It just sets the tone of a nicer dining experience here. At the entrance you can see your Pho being prepared and cooked from their open exhibition style kitchen area. 
  
My order didn't take long at all, was packed carefully and survived the 20 minute ride back home. I ordered the Rau Cai Pho (Veggie Tofu Beef Noodle soup) .  The beef broth had a nice seasoned taste, rice noodles were real good. Not mushy (cooked to order) , had chunks of broccoli, cauliflower and slices of carrots, the toppings, green onions, crunchy bean sprouts and the basil leaves were real fragrant.  Love the tofu that was fried golden brown and didn't get soggy when soaked in the broth.  Pho was perfect comfort food! I was happy with it. Serving was plenty for one and prices are pretty reasonable. Prices range from $6 - $9.  

From taking a quick glance at the menu I also saw they have a kids meal and \"Create Your Own Bowl\", appetizers, and some Chef's Specials you can choose from. The Bun Rieu Oc (Crab noodle soup) crab meat, tofu & Escargot in Tomato soup w/Vermicelli sounds delicious!   They also have a section of different Boba and flavored teas and slush ice drinks. The host who took my order said they're pretty popular and guests sometimes come in late night just to have that. Most definitely will be back for more! 

FYI - Bring Cash!! There is a $20 minimum to use debit and credit cards!"}
{"text":"Our regular pho place was packed so we decided to give this establishment a try.  Pho was okay.   Nothing special except the thin slices of \"steak\" in mine were all clumped together in unappetizing chunks.  I had to separate the slices by hand to eat them.  I've had quite a bit of pho and never experienced that before.  The service was not great.  4-5 kids working this place and they all seemed like they were lost.  Beware they only serve cans of soda.  I hate places that only have canned sodas and worse we had to ask twice to get our sad little can of diet coke.  Never got a bill and when I went to the front to pay, the 2 guys were having a bitch fest about customers, bills etc. and ignored me until they were done talking.  With so many options for Pho especially in this area; the experience needs to be better than this."}
{"text":"open really late night I like that most since working swing shift won't get off till midnight.  It was my first time experienced Vietnamese noodles & so delicious! We always go to ramen place but I love pho totally fell in love with it   Lol.   Lots food & very reasonable price I found my spot now."}
{"text":"The broth is weak and there's a funny taste in the meatballs. The one on rainbow used to be one of my favorites. The food quality and flavor have really slipped with the expansion. Much better Pho one block either way."}
{"text":"Great potstickers! Fresh green tea was so good I took some to go. The rare steak pho was as good as it gets.  My first time here but will definitely come back with family."}
{"text":"As a pho connoisseur and transplant from the OC, I  came on a busy Sunday night with family not expecting much from a Vegas pho joint, but we were hungry and ordered bun bo hue, pho tai, grilled chicken rice and beef stew noodle soup. Clean and tidy with modern decor and young English speaking servers. My impression of the food will be made relative to area rather than OC standards:
1. Bun Bo Hue- broth is shockingly bland for this dish but meaty parts were good. Noodles were soft but acceptable. 2 of 5.
2. Pho Tai- very little selection for those accustomed to a variety of beef cuts/parts, you're limited to beef rare flank and/or meatballs, or chicken. Broth average at best, very little beef flavor, noodles clumpy but edible. Too much star anais  and funky flavor from noodles. 2/5.
3. grilled chicken rice- good moist chicken, tasty overall, 3/5
4. Beef stew soup- good stew brought down by over softened low quality rice noodles, but broth definitely flavorful and makes up for subpar noodles. Barely 4/5.

I would not return for pho or bun bo hue but would return for beef stew and grilled chicken rice. Pho beef broth is very complex and few places outside of OC get it right. Even in Saigon they rely on MSG to compensate for lack of skills. I will give Jenny Pho 3.5 out of 5, relative to Vegas, but in Cali, they would barely score a 2."}
{"text":"I REFUSE to eat pho anywhere else but here! The service is always amazing. The pho itself is to die for. The broth alone is the best I've ever had. It's always steaming hot and has so much flavor. 
I usually order the jenni pho or I create my own. Their spring rolls always taste so fresh. Jenni always walks around and talks to her customers, ensuring everyone is happy. She cares so much for her business and her customers, and the quality in her food really shows. I take all my friends and family here. Plus, they close late! Best hangover food. Love, love, love!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! the soup is very good.  My husband  ordered the super sized bowl of noodle soup (he's a big eater)  it was the perfect amount. It was only  a couple dollars more for double the amount. So it would be a good idea to maybe go with a friend and share a bowl of the supersize.  The costumer service was great and the place itself looked very nice. Overall we had a good experience here and would definetly come back again."}
{"text":"Great food, fast service, nice clean environment, and reasonable prices. If you have never tried Pho, this is a great place to get a genuine experience."}
{"text":"I have been here twice.  The first time they had a tough time because there was a group of eight people who got there before us, and there was so little wait staff that everything took a very long time.  Just eight people!  Anyway, I had the seafood pho.  The broth was very good, and I would say it was on a par with Saigon 8, which is one of the best.  The bowl of pho was interesting in a good way.  The fish pieces were actual good sized pieces of fish, not fish balls.  There were even baby octopus.

I was there a second time about a week later.  Service was faster.  However, there was a bit of a screw up by the waitress.  We got two bowls, and they weren't meant for our table.  I'd have eaten it anyway, and even put in sprouts, sauces, and so on.  I suppose I'd forgotten just what I'd ordered.  Then it was taken away.  My pho was pretty good, and by the way, I never saw that waitress again.

By comparison with other Viet Pho restaurants, there are differences.  They use lacquered chop sticks, rather than throw-away wooden ones as used by Saigon 8 and Pho Little Saigon.  The lacquered ones look classy, but are harder to use.  Tougher to hold onto the noodles.  Unlike other places, they bring the spoons and small empty dishes later, along with the meal.  My problem with that is that I cannot mix my dipping sauce while waiting for the rest of the stuff.  Also, they don't immediately bring out sprouts and greens and sliced peppers, which come out just before the pho.  I like using the sprouts to dip into the dipping bowl, kind of like you would do in a Mexican restaurant.  I know, it's just a whim of mine, but that's what I like to do.  Saigon 8 and Pho Little Saigon make it easy for me to do."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming here. The prices are great, the parking is great, and the portions are awesome and the staff is friendly. But recently the last 2 times I've come I've had the same male waiter, and both times he did not write down our order and both times our order has come out wrong. It's not going to stop me from coming here but I'm sure I'll be asking for a different waiter from now on just to be sure my order is taken correctly.

Update: So within 10 min of my original review, Jenni, the owner came out with the waiter and personally apologized for both times. Very sincere, very nice, very awesome. Jenni is awesome, but she did ask for ways to fix what went wrong and also informed us about the anniversary coming up which sounds exciting and most likely will be attending. Jenni thank you again!"}
{"text":"The service at this place is terrible. 
After we finally sat down, we waited another 15 minutes just to get someone to take our order. We waited another 15 minutes and no food came out at all. Water wasn't refilled, even after chasing someone down to ask what was going on, we get blown off.
I wish I could comment on the food, but we took off. 
Waiting 30 minutes for food is inexcusable, especially for a Pho joint. There are so many Pho joints on this street alone. Why should I put up with this?
If you go here anyways, I hope you have better luck than we did."}
{"text":"I use to love this place until their customer service went downhill. I gave it plenty of chances, but I couldn't do it anymore. I would go the whole meal with no refills and napkins cause the waiter would never check up on us. When they finally decide to check up on us it's just to send us the bill. What really made me stop coming here was the time I went with my brother and there were ants crawling from the floor to the ceiling right behind him! When I brought it to the waiters attention he laughed it off and said he will take care of it. He didn't seem shocked at all..."}
{"text":"It took about 30- 45minutes for my family of 4 to be seated & served. Food wasn't any good. My pho's soup lacked flavor & my parents said their com tams weren't great either. The only good thing was the chicken in my sister's com tam, although even she complained about the rest of her dish. The restroom is tiny. I wouldn't recommend this for sure. Head down the road & eat at the Thai place Kung Fu or any other pho place. Save yourself the time. We spent over an hour here bc of how slow it was. & if you're paying card you have to tip 15% or higher."}
{"text":"Its always a great time for pho. When I first moved to Las Vegas 4 no this ago I was worried that I wouldn't find a good place to eat Pho. A friend introduced me here. Such an awesome restaurant with excellent. Customer service. Since being here in Vegas, I eat here at least 3x a month. They have 1/2 off appetizers!!! We always get the Gyoza (BOGO). The environment is relaxing and feels like a home. Very cool and fun employees. The prices are Excellent, especially for the Super size Photo, double everything! Perfect combination after a long night of drinking!!! They ate open till 3am!"}
{"text":"Took family from out of town here since it was new. We are Vietnamese, so we are a little critical when it comes to our pho. The broth is the most important part and it taste like its straight from the can. The waiter was good and service was fine. No soy bean milk?? Better off waiting in line at pho kim long."}
{"text":"love it!! we were driving around looking for a reasonable priced place to eat and one of our friends found this place, so glad they did. to be honest I dont remember what I ordered lol but I do remember I loved the food and the milk tea with boba was amazing and next time im in vegas im coming back!"}
{"text":"First time trying the place. Nothing special about the pho. Portions were small. Service was terrible has to ask many time do water and refills and when my pho came they didn't bring any of the fixings. By the time they came back with them I had already almost finished my soup. Might give them another chance if I'm desperate only because they are open till 6am"}
{"text":"Jenni Pho Grill is a Pho-nominal place to grab a delicious meal!

If you are in the Las Vegas Area, you need to give this place a try.  I recommend their #1 named after the restaurant.  

Excellent food, tons of parking and great service make this place the spot to go to when in town."}
{"text":"Extremely SATISFIED!!! It has become one of my favorite PHO places to come eat!!!! :D 
I recommend the shrimp PHO soup it's amazing!!! The Thai tea isn't the best I've  tasted I don't recommend it at all!! Other then that everything I've taste is so GOOD!! ;)"}
{"text":"i am another one of those reviewers that wanted to go to sora but ended up here because sora was closed.
plus, i hadn't had pho in some time.
i really love pho.
ever since my friend's mom made me my first bowl when i was a young 20-something.
of course, nothing has come close to being that good but there are places in town that make a tasty bowl of pho.

jenni pho's food is good.
the pho is decent, has good flavor and is substantial.

the problem here is, first and foremost, the service.
our server appeared too cool for school, didn't really seem to want to be there and just had this \"better than thou\" attitude.
secondly, my soup had metal sponge parts in it.
thank goodness i didn't swallow any of the pieces.
the cashier was kind enough to remove my pho from our bill because of this but then proceeded to screw things up even more so.
when we went to pay with our credit card, she asked to see my hubby's i.d. which is ok but then she took his i.d with her to her station.
after she ran his card and brought it back to our table with his i.d., we noticed that she had written his d.l. # on the back of the credit card slip.
oye!!!
you can't do that!!!
so, we scratched it out, signed the slip and left, with no plans to ever return.

food - 4 stars.
deduct 1 star for metal sponge parts in my broth.
deduct 1 star for taking dl and writing down dl # on back of receipt."}
{"text":"If you have a craving for some great Pho this is the place to go! The food is always well made, tastes great, and is well priced. One of the best parts about this restaurant is the service! The owner, Jenni, is often working in the restaurant herself and makes the experience so wonderful. The environment is classy and welcoming and even has a clean open kitchen where you can see them cook your food! They always have specials on their Thai Teas (Buy two get one free!) and often have specials like half price appetizers! My main dish there is the Shrimp Pho and I add veggies to mine. I look forward to it everytime and I'm never disappointed. The food and the staff make this an amazing dining place!"}
{"text":"Today was my first time trying it, it wasn't too bad but I've had better.
The service wasn't good at all, he messed up one of our orders and not once did he check on my table. 

Food was decent, service could of been better. Maybe it was just an off day for them. Overall decent place if your on the go and need a quick fix."}
{"text":"Service: 5 stars
Ambience: 5 stars
Food: 5 stars

I don't understand how anyone can knock this place. The server told us that they've been opened 1 month. For being a new restaurant, I'm really impressed by the way they cared on how we found this place. I love pho and this is one of the best pho I've had. Give this place a chance! It's better than the place down the street... Pho Little Saigon---pho-get that place!"}
{"text":"Not much to say about this place. All I can say is, I've had better.

We came here on a Monday afternoon. Hungover from a long night of drinking and living the Vegas life ;) 

When we arrived we were seated immediately. Which was good cause we were hungry and happy there wasn't a wait. However, the waiter was extremely slow. He took over 20 minutes to come back and take our orders. Another 15-20 minutes to bring us waters and any other beverages people may have ordered. Luckily the pho didn't take as long to come out after he put in our order. 

Overall: I wouldn't recommend or come back here. The service was horribly slow and the pho just tasted okay."}
{"text":"Pho here is very flavorful. The meat portions are generous and they have an open kitchen layout so you can see your food being made. Our server was attentive and the store itself is clean. 

My boyfriend decided to be adventurous and try the XXL pho...IT WAS HUUUGE!!!! He managed to finish it. I think we finally found a place where he can get full off of just pho haha. I don't remember if the price for that pho was listed on the menu, but in case you're curious: it came out to $15 or $16. 

JenniPho is a place that I will definitely be visiting again soon. Bonus points for them being open late to satisfy those early AM pho cravings."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's always clean, the staff is friendly and the food is good!
Jenny is such a sweet and friendly owner! She even gives awesome hugs!!!
I love their pho and that they're not stingy on their meats! Especially their yummy tripe!
I love their spring rolls and their potstickers. 
I usually have the same thing every time.
But so far everything has been great! 
Love this place!!!!! 
The pho is very tasty!!"}
{"text":"Can seem to find any good bun bo hue anywhere in Las Vegas. Why can't anyone make good bun bo hue here. I miss Vietnamese food in the bay area (San Jose). Their pho here is ok. Saigon 8 is better for pho."}
{"text":"Since there was a long wait at Ramen Sora, my husband suggested we eat here instead.

The service was good. The staff was friendly. Our water was always filled.

Unfortunately I can't say the same about my food. I ordered the pho with steak and tripe. This is the only thing I get at Vietnamese restaurants. When it was brought out, it looked like it was going to be amazing. The bowl was huge. However one sip of the soup and I was greatly disappointed. It was unbelievably bland. A good broth is what makes a bowl of pho great since the noodle itself is typically flavorless.

Maybe I've been spoiled by all the delicious pho in San Gabriel Valley, but this was very underwhelming. 

Lesson learned. Next time just suck it up and wait. There's a reason why there is a line."}
{"text":"Came back here after our vacation in September! Came for a convention this time but craved the authentic food! Excellent service and quality. Prices are reasonable and so much food! Lots of great options and I'm obsessed with the Thai tea. Something we can't really get in Toronto. All the buffets and fast foods in Vegas can quickly become the same and boring. Come here if you'd like a great meal with fresh ingredients and try something different. I found the restaurant to be very clean and friendly and had no issues what so ever! Hopefully, I'll be able to come back soon!"}
{"text":"Food was great! I love the broth and overall a good taste! We ordered egg rolls as an appetizer and the soup came out before so we had to cancel our order of egg rolls. Would've gotten more stars but service was sub par."}
{"text":"I hate that this is my very first negative review here but it was such a bad experience that I was itching to get out of Jenni Pho! You can ask anyone that I know and 10 out 10 will tell you that I am in no way a picky person. So...that means a lot. 

Drinks came after food....had to remind her twice we ordered a beer and 3 Thai teas. 6 people but spoons and forks for 3 people? Table was so uneven that drinks and bowls kept almost landing onto my lap. Had to put Every Single Thing on napkins to keep them from sliding. 4 adults and 2 small children meant automatic 18% gratuity. 

Omg...the food...Tom Yum Soup is meant to be Sweet/Sour/Spicy but all 4 of us agreed that it was just spicy water with whatever leftover stuff they had. Not at all sour which is the signature taste of tom yum soup. The Bo Luc Lac (Shaking Beef) was plain and was probably still Mooing when it got to the table. The Thai tea had too much Water to powder ratio. (There was no way that was freshly brewed) Will be the last time I come here. Sorry!"}
{"text":"I love Jenni Pho food.  I love the Bun Bo Hue, I love the pork chop rice, I love the pho.  I can't get enough of it.  My friends and I will always go to Jenni Pho for food on Rainbow when we are in Vegas.  Now that she has her new location on Spring Mountain, we don't need to drive all the way out there for food!  And now it can be our go-to place after our crazy nights on the strip!

I love how the kitchen is open and the place is always clean.  There is nothing sketchy about it.  

And what the heck are people talking about the service? I mean, have these people been to places like Pho Kim Long?  Yikes, terrible service!  I've always gotten really good service at Jenni Pho and the staff is always friendly.  Great food, great service, great location.  What is there not to love about this place?"}
{"text":"This place USED to be our favorite place. The last few times have just gotten progressively worse. (One time we got there before they supposedly closed but they decided to close early and Another time, they changed their hours) the cleanliness is suspect. There was a time we came here and were sat at a dirty, sticky table. This place has also been shut down multiple times for many offenses by the health department. 

This time, we thought we might give this place one more shot. We walked in the door hoping for a good experience. We noticed that The sauces are no longer in the squeeze bottles, they are in little glass containers with plastic spoons in them. I find this one of the most unsanitary \"new\" things that they started to do. We don't know how other people used it. What if they licked the spoon, or set it on the dirty table and then put it back in the jar? They used to offer hot tea for free, but now they charge $2.50 for it. When the \"hot\" tea arrived at the table, it was cold. The bowl of pho came and it barely had any actual pho (noodles!). There was no cilantro, and the broth was watery. What a waste. Will not be coming here again."}
{"text":"Came here once and wasn't too sure if I wanted to return. Food was okay, just had better. I had the bun riue and it had real crab but it was missing something. I added more fish sauce but it didn't have the taste I was used too. We had the spring rolls wasn't all.that great."}
{"text":"Came here w/ 3 friends. They ordered Pho & Bun Bo Hue. Their order came out and 20 mins later my Bun Tom Nuong still hadn't came out hahahaha .. Ironically that's supposed to be the fastest dish out. I went ahead and cancelled my meal."}
{"text":"The food is great the portions are perfect and the sevice is outstanding...the only problem is they have a 20.00 min to use debt, this is a problem for me Because I usually go by myself and don't carry cash so I probably won't come back because I can get the same great food service and portions two minutes down the street and use debit anytime I want."}
{"text":"SORRY JENNI, I REALLY WANNA SAY IT'S NOT YOU. IT'S ME. BUT IN THIS CASE, IT'S ALL YOU!

So here were the events leading up to this decision. 

It was a cold thursday night. I would say it was about 47 degrees with the wind blowing which made it even colder. So a hot bowl of pho would sure hit the spot. The wifey suggested our usual pho place. I wanted to be adventurous and try this new place based on the 4 star average. So off we went.

We come in and are greeted warmly. We sit down to a really nice glass table with what looks like seashells. I look around to see some nice chandeliers. I must say the decor is very nice. But just like any other relationship, once you get to know the person, you find out they are not who you thought they were.

So comes the unpleasantries. 

First off, I think they had the thermostat set to 70 degrees. BELOW ZERO. At first I thought it was just me. But after I looked around, I noticed everybody else in the restaurant had their jackets on. First strike.

I order their namesake, which is your standard combination. Came out at a decent time. Nothing out of the ordinary. If anything, it was a LITTLE MORE GREASY than I wanted. Second strike.

So we finish our our soups and ask for the check. We ordered two of the same soup at 7.99 a pop. So the total was 17 and some change. As I pull out my debit card, our server tells us that there is a 20 DOLLAR MINIMUM TO USE PLASTIC. Say what? You would think that they would at least have an ATM there but no. Even if they did have one you would still have to pay a convenience fee to withdraw cash along with whatever your financial institution might charge you on top of that. Third stirke.

So to make up the difference, we decided to get a milk tea with boba for 2.99 to push the total over 20. We get our drink. I take a sip. THE BOBA WAS HARD. For those that are not familiar with boba drinks, the boba is supposed to be soft and chewy. That was the fourth strike.

Now if this was baseball, they would of struck out plus an extra strike, unless they were bowling, in which case you would have 6 more frames. Originally I wanted to give them only 1 star, but the service and the decor were decent so I was gonna give them the benefit of the doubt meaning I am willing to give them another try at a future date. I will update this review accordingly based off of that.

So Jenni, we just need some time apart. This relationship looks like its not going anywhere except straight to this review. Maybe next time I see you things will be much better. Until then, I wish you luck."}
{"text":"I came here with a few of my friends, we were visiting from out of town. I didn't set my standards very high because I didn't expect to find better Vietnamese food than Orange County here in Vegas. I ordered the bun bo hue and it was surprisingly good. I was curious our server, Michael, about his tattoos and that turned into a mini conversation. He was hospitable and always made sure we got what we needed (extra napkins, forks, extra plates because we split some dishes amongst ourselves). I'd probably come back again the next time I'm in town - open late, good service"}
{"text":"So I gave this place a two stars because the Pho was good and full of flavor, but the customer service is horribly unacceptable (with the exception of the hostess who was very attentive).  I'm pretty patient, but I literally had to wave down someone to get their attention so I could get a refill on my water.  This is expected when a restaurant is busy, but there was only 2 other parties dining (one being a two-top) and workers just gathered to talk stories. 

   After we ate, my friend wanted to order Boba to go.  We waited another 10 minutes before my friend decided she was going to have to wave someone down again.  She got someones attention, but instead of coming up to help us, he yelled across the room and said: \"Can I get you anything else?\"  She went along with it and tried to order from a distance, but when he couldn't figure out what she was saying, he finally decided to approach us at the table.  I took this opportunity to order an Ice Coffee for my girlfriend, but without the ice.  She has a long day tomorrow and wanted the coffee for the next day (which is why I asked to hold the ice).  To my surprise, the cup arrived with it being  1/2 empty!  I've never seen that before! (http://s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/gJWJ8YmQK2_oaUSmnbTYiA/l.jpg) Seriously...End of review. I'm never coming to this place again.  *"}
{"text":"Every time we're in Vegas and want some good Vietnamese food we always go to Jenni Pho.  They have the best bun bo hue and egg rolls!   My kids also love the beef pho, the broth is so tasty and authentic.  Their com tam combination is my husband favorite especially the  pork chop very flavorful and he loves the portions!!  
 
Jenni Pho is so nice and clean not dirty like other pho and Asian restaurants.  You can actually see the kitchen and how they cook through the glass window that is so awesome I've never seen that at any Asian restaurants.  I love the atmosphere and the service.  You never see that at any Asian restaurants!!

Thanks Jenni Pho we had a good weekend every time we're in Vegas and definitely be back again for the bun bo hue!!!"}
{"text":"I was craving for Pho, drove by and saw about 20 people.  I guessed it must be really good.  Oh my... I was wrong... The broth was salty, and didn't smell like Pho at all.  I used 4 prices of lemon, still very salty.,and all MSG.  I have Pho at least one a week, and that was the worst Pho I ever had.   The restaurant is clean but the service and food were terrible.   There were four of us ( 2 adults 2 kids).  I ordered 3 special Pho.  I specifically asked for two small empty bowl for the kids and the scissors.  After 10 minutes, they came with one Pho and two small empty bowl, no scissors.  I had to ask again.   We thought that they might want us to feed the kids  before bringing out the other two.  After 10 minutes of waiting,  I called the waiter and asked for the Pho.  We found out he thought we only ordered one bowl  of Pho.  How smart huh?  Our phones were out of batteries, and they have the sign free wifi.  Since I had my iPad with me, I asked them for the password so I can log in.  The waiter gave it to me in a piece of paper.  Both my husband and I tried several times, however we could not log in.  He intentionally gave us a wrong password.  I gave him back the paper and told him you can have it back since we can't log in.  He said he'll check and be right back to try on my iPad.  He came back with the food and totally ignored that I wanted to use internet.  If you don't want customers to use your internet then don't offer.  I"}
{"text":"Honestly, I enjoyed our dinner here. But we aren't super fussy people. The atmosphere was nice and the open kitchen and overall look of the place was clean and nice. I think out of all the pho places we have been to so far, this is my favorite. Food came out perfect and they actually serve the extra large bowl of pho here (my boyfriend has been disappointed by the other pho places in terms of size). The fried egg that came with my com thit nuong was made perfect and that's all I care about haha! Anyway, server was quick and nice. We were seated as soon as we walked in and waters came out right away as we looked at the menu. Good experience!"}
{"text":"Pho is a tad oily but decent nonetheless.

Considering that it's Jenni Pho and not some regular joe shmoe pho restaurant in Chinatown, I went in with soaring expectations. It was a mediocre meal with decent service so it's not bad by any means, but I was slightly disappointed.

First off, there are still NO CREDIT/DEBIT CARD TRANSACTIONS. I just don't like to carry cash and rarely have 'em on me. Jenni Pho, why do you always make me take a trip to a Bank of America to take a withdrawal of $40 bucks after a meal? Until these slowpokes update their system, take some cash with you.

Secondly, the service is not lightning-fast which many pho eaters may be accustomed to with other venues. You have to ask for extra napkins because there's no dispenser on the table and they only give you two napkins for each person to start with. The tables in the middle are terribly small and it's a joke that there's four chairs around them because it was crammed like a tuna can with three people.

The pho is pretty oily. The one reason why I liked the Jenni Pho on Rainbow is because their broth is usually very clean and less oily. The pho at this location just tasted very thick and saturated with unnecessary flavor.

Overall, it was a pretty mediocre meal. I know they will get better with time because it's new. I'm sure Jenni or whoever is in charge will straighten things out eventually. HEY JENNI, UPDATE YOUR SYSTEMS TO ACCEPT DEBIT CARDS, OK?!! Geez."}
{"text":"No service. Slow service. Bad customer service. We ordered a beef stew pho. Broth had no taste. The beed had no taste or the vegetable. We complained to the server his respond is: that's the beef stew we serve I don't know what you want me to do. I asked to exchange something else. His response: we don't do that. We left no tip. Horrible experience!"}
{"text":"Came to Jenni Pho when I visited Vegas with my boyfriend and also came here with my family in the past when we visited Vegas!  Everything else on the strip is too dang expensive or doesn't sound as appetizing, so we come here to eat.   The food here is more flavorful, worth the price you pay, the service was good(everyone was really attentive), &the food came out pretty quickly considering how busy they were when we came.  So every time I come here, I always try to try something different.  (I'm Vietnamese myself so it's not like I'm trying something new) But HEY every time I leave Jenni Pho,  I am SATISFIED :)  Definitely come by and give this place taste!  Deliciosio."}
{"text":"My wife and I discovered pho about 4 years ago in Atlantic City.  Since then I/we have been eating it fairly regularly.  Am I a pho expert, absolutely not.  However I have eaten enough to know good vs bad.  Jenni pho has very good pho in my humble estimation.

Was in Vegas for my son's 21st birthday, and he had never experienced pho before and I figured he needed to pop his pho cherry.  Saw a billboard for jenni pho and decided to give this place a try.

Waiter and I figured the flank steak was a pretty safe bet for a first timer and I went with the seafood. Also got the spring rolls as an appetizer.  Standard spring rolls, good, not the best or worst. As for the pho, first of all, it comes out HOT, hotter than others I've tried.  Gentleman who works there explained that they heat the bowls just before they put the broth in, so that makes it extra hot.  (noticed other patrons eating it right away, but we opted to let it cool a bit)  The broth was above average to me, very flavorful, not bland by any stretch of the imagination.  The meat in my son's was very tasty, cooked just right.  My seafood had fish, shrimp, and squid.  The fish was awesome, shrimp was good, squid was not the best.  (note, my favorite seafood pho in Houston has scallops, so I measure against that).  What sets the pho from jenni apart from the rest is the amount and quality of noodles.  Many times I have pho and find myself wishing for more noodles.  Jenni's had the most noodles I have ever had in pho.  To me, that made it a heartier, more filling dish.  So filling in fact, that we couldn't finish our bowls.  Very good value and very tasty.

So why choose jenni pho over others?  Service!!!  Granted, we went very late at night, so they weren't really busy, but it was by far the BEST, friendliest service I have ever experienced in any place that serves pho.  Everyone there was super nice, helpful, and friendly.

End result, if you are looking for above average pho at a very good value with exceptional service, then Jenni pho deserves a shot."}
{"text":"Big, filling, warming bowls of pho...I liked it a lot, the tea was good also. The waiter we had was so nice, he built me little plates of his favorite sauce combos. Super clean dining area and bathroom. I would go back , but I have to try other pho places to compare beforehand."}
{"text":"The pho here is disappointing. It lacks flavor. It is not savory at all. I can barely taste the star anise, one of the key ingredients of pho. Other flavors were also light or missing. But the bowl does have lots of meat. But quantity does not make up for lack of quality. 

The chicken lemongrass is not traditional Vietnamese either. The meat is deep fried instead of stir fried. Even though I can taste the lemongrass, I find the meat hard and dry. 

The crispy chicken wings are good although not traditional Vietnamese. 

The service is standard Vietnamese/ Oriental: polite, fast & efficient but no smile."}
{"text":"Very flavorful food. I had the rare beef pho, which had a tasty broth redolent with star anise.  Service needs improvement, though.  Our waiter seemed like he'd rather be anywhere but here.  Also, he did not bring out the table salad that goes with the pho.  We had to ask for it, and by the time it arrived, we were halfway done with the meal.  How hard is it to plate some bean sprouts, basil, jalapeño, and lime?  Will probably return, and hopefully service will improve."}
{"text":"This place always seats me properly never has me waiting way less packed then pho Kim long this honestly is better your pho comes out very warm n cooked well with delicious broth the waiters are all so sweet this is one pho place I rate a 5 because I've never ever had a bad experience here good food as well as customer service I came here all the time ."}
{"text":"Average food, awful service. I guess two stars is generous.

I stopped by with a few of my friends who insisted on having pho last week. Personally, I'm not a huge fan of pho as it all tastes the same to me; thus if I think it's bad, its probably absolutely awful to everyone else. Unfortunately for Jenni here, her broth was surprisingly bland, the noodles were average, and they skimped out on the meat.  I had to load up the pho with sriracha to compensate for the flavorless broth. The rare beef in the pho seemed to be low quality luncheon meat, and they didn't even add much in. 

Service was a disaster from start to finish. We only saw our server when we ordered and when she dropped off the check. Good luck trying to get their attention if you need something else. The $20 minimum to use a credit card is total BS. Hopefully I'm never forced to come here again."}
{"text":"I never have any complaints about this location whenever I come by. This is a recommended place to get pho if you're in the area. 

I hardly ever deviate from getting pho when I go to a pho place, but the few times I have had rice dishes here, I haven't been disappointed. I personally am a fan of broken rice because I like the small grains, I find them easier to chew and more enjoyable. The pork and chicken are cooked fairly well with a good amount of flavor in each bite. The pho itself is nothing too out of the ordinary. The noodles are good, the meat is good, the broth is good, what more do you want?

The restaurant itself feels very clean and orderly. Like at Pho So 1, the food there is good as well, but everything always feels so disorderly and it just feels like it could be a bit cleaner, Jenni Pho doesn't have that problem. 

I'm not loyal to any pho place in Las Vegas, but Jenni Pho is definitely added to the pool of pho places in the city."}
{"text":"Pho is like a savior after those long and mostly blurry nights on the strip and there are a ton of places near Chinatown to get your beef broth to power you up for another night of debauchery.  Although the others may seem more popular, I think Jenni Pho is one of the better ones.  First of all, the owner is super clever with the name.  Already kudos for that.  Second, even if you are hung over or drunk, you can't deny that this place is cleaner than the other pho restaurant around the area. May not be a huge priority when you are trying to get that oh so yummy beef broth in you mouth and into your belly but better be safe than sorry.  Jenni Pho's pho is actually pretty good. It has the usual Vegas prices so you at least you aren't paying a premium in comparison.  Also the broth is pretty legit with the right amount of spices and herbs. The soup comes out hot, which is always a must when you get pho.  Next the meat to noodle ratio is pretty good. You aren't feeling like you paid $10 for a bowl of pho khong (pho noodle soup). You actually get some meat! Not too hungry, look for a super size bowl and sharesies with you and a friend.

All in all, Jenni Pho hits the spot when you are looking for some good noodle soup. The place is clean, the parking is simple, the location is prime and literally blocks away from the other pho places. Why go somewhere else and wait then you can come here and be seated immediately and get the same quality (if not better) of food.  Also, if you aren't in the mood for pho, they also have vermicelli, rice plates, other noodle soup dishes such as bun bo hue or bun rieu, or bun rieu oc."}
{"text":"Came here for the soft opening, they were offering a free entree and drink at different times during their three day soft opening before their actual Grand Opening. We were there on a Tuesday night right before opening, got there after class so around 4:20, no one was really around, but by the time they opened at 5 there was a line leading to the parking lot. And when we left the parking lot was full and still a long line out. Everyone loves free food! 

I had the Bun Bo Hue, it was pretty decent. It wasn't really spicy at all. It contained a lot of pork meat which was okay as well. My mom would say the meat \"smelled\" as she is picky with meats it definitely smelled like eating a pig. My friend and I ordered the same dish, the meat in his dish was smaller than mine, and since I don't really eat pork, I gave him mine, which was when he commented that mine was larger. 

Second time I went was for lunch special, had the Pho Dac Biet, which was also pretty good. It wasn't anything special that stood out. Both times the portion size seemed smaller than it was at Pho So 1 or any other locations I've been at, but it might have been because of the promotion they were giving out. So the sizes might have gotten bigger. It was free food so it was worth trying, I'll probably go again to make final conclusions if I'd go again or not. 

The thai tea everyone got came out pretty fast, but it wasn't strong. All the foods came out pretty fast, but I'm sure they had it ready as there was a very long line and with certain specials being free, I didn't think anyone would really stray from the 'free' menu too much."}
{"text":"Food:  ok but too salty
Environment : clean and open kitchen
Service: servers are nice but we have to constantly ask for things.  We have 6 people and was given 3 napkins and 4 spoons.  
Although we have 6 and service was just ok, we were charged 18% gratuity.  Not happy about this. 
Conclusion:  so many pho restaurants nearby. I definitely won't come back."}
{"text":"Service was excellent And the place looks great. There is a general dining area and a smaller dining area thats more intimate, sectioned off by bamboo.

I had the jennipho which i assume is there signature dish it being number one on the menu and named after their restaurant. The presentation was great. When i had the broth it was not as i expected it wasnt bad but i expected more complex, stronger flavors.

The seafood pho was slightly better. I seasoned with chili sauce and Sriracha and bam. But i dont like adding anything to broth to enhance flavor.

Their appetizers were good and they even sell MyMosas. I would like to try other dishes but so far not impressed with pho."}
{"text":"After reading some of the reviews, I thought this might be a good place to have some pho.  We ordered the special pho dac biet and bun bo hue along with a Vietnamese dessert.  Although the pho broth was decent, the raw beef that was on top was already cooked and there wasn't all that much noodle inside the big bowl.  The bun bo hue was better.  There were a lot of ingredients inside such as pigs blood and pork hock.  It was flavourful and the noodles cooked al dente.  Wasn't sure what was in the green dessert, but it was okay.  The taste was good, but couldn't quite get over the texture, it was too slimy for my liking.   Not sure why, they don't have che ba mau (3 colour dessert drink) in the menu.  The place was very clean and the service was quite good.  3 stars"}
{"text":"I am furious. Came at 11:00 am. Our waiter comes over to take our drinks,and i tell him i want a boba milk tea, and without even taking everyone else's drink orders he runs back to the kitchen to go make it. He later comes with four waters and we finally tell him what the rest of us actually wanted to drink. Ps dont get any of their specialty drinks bc they all taste sour! No wonder theyre all buy 2 get one free. The tables before us were still waiting for their food and they all had a problem with their food when they finally got it. Our appetizer came 30 minutes after we ordered it, and every table who came in after us got their food within ten minutes, weve been waiting for our food for 40 minutes already! When the server was about to serve the most recent table their food, we yelled for him and ask him what happened to our food! And he gives us the most dumbfounded look and runs back to the kitchen. We didnt even get ONE apology. There wasnt even one server who spoke vietnamese, and only ONE chef in the kitchen. Does it make sense that there are THREE SERVERS and ONE CHEF working in a sunday brunch?! There were 5 families in the dining room! We finally got our food AN HOUR LATER. LITERALLY.  I can understand if the kitchen is coming out with the food slow, but the fact that our server didnt even put in our order is what made me mad! When the owner finally came to work thats when food started actually coming out the kitchen. We still had to ask the servers for bean sprouts for our pho too. 

Whoever the owner is, please teach your wait staff how to give good customer service. We had 3 boys serving us and none of them gave us good service."}
{"text":"This place is just absolutely awesome! The turn up the night before at XS was unreal. I was suffering from my a massive hang over and was in need of my elixir. I stopped by this place before my journey back to Los Angeles. Now the plaza if self is not that nice looking, but when you come in BAM. You see most likely one of the nicest cleanest pho restaurants known to mankind. They have an open kitchen and everything looks clean. Sat down with the crew and ordered rare steak pho. Service was prompt and courteous. Food came out quick. I liked how they have chili oil, I thought that was new. It gave my pho an extra kick. On the way out I gave Jenni some dabs after feeling like a million bucks! Will come back when I'm back in sin city."}
{"text":"If I can give. Them a negative star I would...I for one will not be going back to this place ever again...they did not get my order right not once not twice I had to return it 2x and they had to make it the 3rd time...I asked for something simple...Jenni pho with no mint or cilantro...they brought it with both I ask them to take it out and they literally picked it out of the same bowl in the back...and still had some cilantro in it...I asked them for extra fish sauce for my wife's vermecelli they brought it to us like 10 mins after I asked for it...OK this little things I can deal with...I just deal with people trying to scam other people though...we had a party of 5...they automatically charged us 15% gratuity...when that girl brought over our check I gave her my card and she asked if I would like to put my tip on the card and I said sure...they gave me a choice on how much percent I would like to give...I put in 12 cuz I was not happy with how they handled my food and my experience...she gave me receipt and I took a look it didn't seem right so I asked her for a detail receipt of our order...she said well I already closed it and gave me an attitude...rolling her eyes and trying to get my receipt...when she printed it out...I noticed that they charge me for everything..milk tea no ice 50 cent extra on both our milk teas...she didn't mention what size we wanted and she didn't tell us that having no ice was 50 cent extra? When the hell did have less of something cost more...OK on that portion it said in small as print that no ice is 50 cent extra so OK our mistake...but still that is really terrible how she didn't give us that kind of courtesy to let us know...another thing was that they charged us 15 % gratuity on our meal and she asked his if I wanted to put my tip on the card...they already charged me and she did not mention that smit was already on the bill she just wanted me to tip her more lol for what bringing my order wrong and coming by what never to check to see if we needed anything? So I asked her u guys already charged us for 15 % gratuity and she was like yea I asked if u would like to put additional tip on ur card like it was suppose to be normal....us she serious? After we got charge 15% for a party of 5 and being waited on with such poor service she expects more tip? I did the math and total we tipped almost 27 %...she was like well I can't do anything about returning the money on ur card but I can give it to u cash...I was like do u really think I'm worried about the extra 12 dollars I tipped u? I wanted was her give us some sort of heads up with the bill and tip...didn't apologize or nothing till she was hesitant about giving us our money back...I said u keep it but u know what I will never be returning ever again...y I'm writing this review and y I am being so upset and pissed off at this is because I was there with some visitors from a different country...and they had a hard time understanding y they were charged so much when we didn't order much...imagine how many ppl that they have took advantage of with methods like this...what is very disappointing i can only imagine for those that live here and visit places like this they get taken advantage of especially those that speak a little broken English and have a difficult time with English as well...it's just so damn terrible...this place is definitely and will forever be on my crap list for sure...I will not be going back will make sure all my friends know of this...just so dang terrible"}

Dont eva come in the morning time cuz U have to wait for nealy an hour to get foods ready!  u dont wana ruin ur trip, don't ya? Only thing is better than other rest is pho, thats y I give them 2*"}
{"text":"Oh man this is going to be a long review so if you want the gist, god awful, do not go. I was so dissapointed with everything that once I got home I had to write a review.  First of All I am Vietnamese and Pho is such a soulful dish, the pho I had today was the worst thing ever.  My parents came to visit with my sister and a friend, and after a long day we wanted to finish with a hot bowl of pho.  I have seen this place, I have even walked by it when I ate at Sura.  There was a smell so tantalizing that I had to go and try it. I thought it would be a good idea to try Jenni Pho Grill tonight.

We walk in saw that the place was not too busy maybe about 7 tables.  We got seated fairly quickly.  Our server was pretty nice, my parents attempted to order in vietnamese but the server informed us that he did not speak it.  Cool cool, no big deal, he seemed like a nice kid.  After that it went downhill from there.  We ordered three bowls of the Pho Dac biet, and two orders of the pho tai.  We finished our order with two thai teas, the jenni jelly drink, and two waters.  

My family waited around, no waters, no drinks nothing.  We watched three tables get seated order their food and get their food before we even had anything on our table!  after a 25 min wait, our waiter finally comes back with two waters.  We asked why the service was so slow, he stated that there was only two waiters and said sorry.  So it was fine for now.  After we got the water nothing else came to us.  We watched as the tables that came in after us eat, and one even finished before we were served.  After another 35 minutes, our food finally came out.  First the two dac biet bowls, then the last three.  Finally the drinks came out as well.  I have worked at a boba place before, making thai teas should not take a hour.  For waiting for so long I was really anticipating for a great bowl of pho.  Oh man was I wrong.  The broth was lukewarm, it could not even finish cooking my meat.  The broth tasty funky as if it was made with a pre made powder.  My parents and I watched a one cook was constantly tasting the broth, and we saw no bones that make a great broth.  The bowl was mostly disappointing broth.  There were very little meat and noodles.  We ate, and we wanted to get out as soon as possible.  We asked for a to go cup for the thai tea because it took so long we were just going to take it home.  It took almost another five minutes just to get a plastic cup.  

In the end it was just terrible.  My family and I went home unhappy.  And the thing is I love food, I work in the industry so I timing is very important.  Having only two servers is rough but it can not be the only excuse.  If there was something wrong or if it was going to take a little longer, they should inform the customers.  The worst part was watching tables come in before us and eat before we got anything.  I am never going back.  I really hope they clean up their act, there are a lot of pho places out here and if they don't fix things it will be buried beneath the rest."}
{"text":"If I can give a zero star, I would. 
So first of all, this restaurant charges 50cents extra for asking 'no ice' in their drinks. Are you serious?! That was a first strike. 

Second: When we just finished eating, the lady at the counter rudely brought us our bill... Did they want to kick us out or something? I looked around and saw that 80% of the tables/seats were empty. So why the rush?

Third and last strike: when the cashier girl(who was also eating during her work) told us that there's a minimum of $20 for using the credit card. Again, are you serious.. Most of the places are set to $10.. Why be greedy and add extra $10 into their minimum credit card charge amount?

To sum it up:
Food was good, but I just could not tolerate the way they treat their customers. I will NEVER return."}
{"text":"Good service, a little slow but they take care of you. Pho before going home, so you won't get hang over. Lol good price for good pho. Will actually recommend to everyone to try though..."}
{"text":"Let me start off saying that me and my Vietnamese coworker went out in search of some good Vietnamese food.  However, this Vietnamese restaurant didn't have any staff that spoke Vietnamese. That being said the food was still very good.

Walking in to this restaurant the beautiful decor was very oriental. 

We ordered the the egg rolls to start, which were very delicious.  I order the pork and shrimp w/ rice noodle which were excellently cooked and extremely tasty.

My Vietnamese coworker requested a Vietnamese sauce that they didn't have.  He has lots to complain about, but for me everything was great.

I would recommend this place for anyone who is not Vietnamese.  The food is delicious but made by cooks of other Asian decent."}
{"text":"Had the Thom-Yum soup & it was delicious! I was feeling under the weather & after I had it, my achey body was rejuvenated..... I'm going to make it a weekly visit.
The service was awesome!!!"}
{"text":"My sister, fiancé, and I decided we wanted Vietnamese food. Based on my sister's recommendation, we came to visit. We walked in a practically empty restaurant. The service was ok, it can use some improvement especially since there is no one in the restaurant. 

The food is ok. I wish they had bigger bowls because I ordered a vermicelli bowl and it can be tough to try to mix the ingredients in the bowl if the ingredients fill up to the top and there is no room to mix it! I was slightly annoyed by that.

Overall, I experienced better... 

There are several Vietnamese restaurants in the vicinity and competition is fierce so step it up, Jenni! Get in the game or sit on the bleachers."}
{"text":"This is my absolute #1 go to pho spot hands down the best! Went to other pho places and they arent up to par with Jenni Pho! I've been coming here for years! The portion size is huge and if ur really hungry super size it! Don't settle for less the price is very reasonable considering how much u get!

10/31/16
SOOO ITS HALLOWEEN !! And its a 70's theme and Jenni's all dresses up! With matching music in the background! Its just an absolutely wonderful way to end the night :D"}
{"text":"Came here twice consecutively on late night food runs.

I'm glad it opens really late, pho places I'm used to usually close around 9pm.

The broth is the best part, not too oily, not too much msg either! I wish they gave bigger portions though, the regular sized bowl is about 1/2 a regular bowl of pho for me :(

Eggrolls were great - service A-okay. Not the best, not the worst.

I would recommend coming here when you have your pho cravings or a chilly day :)"}
{"text":"There's a reason why this Pho place closes early compared to most places. Simply put, like your dad or mom have probably have said about your exs, you could do so much better.

I went here with my fiancee just for a quick lunch. I had the pho tai and she had bun cha. (Bun cha is rice vermicelli with fried spring rolls usually accompanied by seasoned fish sauce in case you are wondering.) Now going to Jenni Pho, Pho being the namesake of the restaurant, you think you would get something that is standard or above par. Not so much. Like opening a can of peanuts and getting snakes instead, I was quickly disappointed and surprised at how disappointing it was. The broth was weak and I felt I could have done better with a packet of ramen. The noodles were alright and the beef was eh. My fiancee's dish didn't far any better. Her vermicelli was cold. Not cold as in it was hot in the window and probably got cold after waiting for a little bit. No. It was cold as in grabbing it from a lowboy cold. The spring rolls were also mediocre at best. Service was not bad and seemed apologetic for the most part. The floors were a little messy and the restaurant having not been busy when we were there, I can only say probably due to laziness. 

Competing against other established Pho institutions in Chinatown is rough but at least bring your full game. Just felt like this place needs a lot of improvements in the kitchen work for this place to be at least somewhat approachable again."}
{"text":"Love the create a bowl with 5 meats it's like 9 bucks for a huge delicious flavorful bowl . I get the same thing every single time double Flank , fatty flank , brisquit, steak extra bean sprouts and gyoza, Buy 2 get 1 free Thai tea boba mmmm! I'm only sad their hours are closing earlier because you never know what time you need a pho fix !!! Great fast service, great pho, cute clean spot in china town ! Get you some Jenni pho !!!"}
{"text":"Great service and very friendly staff. Had the fake crab meat Pho. The broth had a great flavor as I wasn't expecting that. Thai tea is always a great drink. Probably because it is loaded with sugar. Tried the pineapple filled with sherbet. This dessert had nice simple flavor. A very great end to a meal."}
{"text":"Food: My local friends love this place and we came here to eat after running a local half marathon. I ordered the pho dac biet and some Spring rolls. As for the pho, I've had better. But it was decent. The broth was kind of lukewarm. I prefer my pho piping hot. They use pretty big bowls here. Even though the price of lime has recently skyrocketed, they still gave us plenty of lime wedges. The Spring rolls were pretty good. They sure used a lot of lettuce.

Service: Service was good. They kept checking to see if we had water.

Location: Parking was easy and plentiful. It's nice to eat at a restaurant away from the hustle and bustle of the Strip."}
{"text":"I go here about twice a wk! Love their bun rieu and pho dac biet. As homemade as they come! We love it here! The service is excellent!"}
{"text":"This place have good foods and drinks.  Also, the place look nice and clean.  Their pho is good and so is their bun bo hue.  They have a special promotion in the drinks now that if you buy 2 get one 1 free.  The mike tea and thai tea are good.  We went here at least one time when we in Vegas."}
{"text":"Not bad. pho is really good, but i wouldn't order boba there again. It's a nice change from pho kim long because they are not as crowded, which makes it a more enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"I am not a Pho expert but I am steeping out of my pho box to learn more about it.  So I cannot give you an honest answer of which is the best in town, I will have to do more research ;) 

A good hardy broth LOTS of flavor a little bit of grease on the top but I believe that is from the cooking process kind of like a slow cooked stew.  Lots of noodles and meat and gave you lots of veggies to fill up for bowl with.  BTW the bowls are huge I don't think anyone will be leaving hungry.  Again I am not an expert but I thought this was a great Pho soup

The decor is nice and the kitchen open to watch your food being cooked for you.  They do have the credit card machine in that day so it is no longer cash only."}
{"text":"After a long day traveling, we came here for a late dinner before heading home. We were seated immediately, wait staff was very attentive and menu had a good selection of pho along with the typical Vietnamese fare.  My pho was good, not the best ive had and far from the worst.  The noodles were a little clumpy probaby from sitting for a little.  Broth was flavorful and they are generous with their meat.
Overall, a good bowl of pho for your buck. I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"It was my first time coming in here last night (Tuesday) and it definitely gave me a good first impression!! Service was fast, we got seated and served right away. They played EDM in the background, which is a good thing because I like EDM. On to the food, I ordered, think it was beef ball noodle soup (a Vietnamese pho) and I loved it. Our server (David) was so nice and helpful, he made sure we got what we needed like extra bowls, forks, etc since we split some of our dishes. We'll def come back!"}
{"text":"I went on easter Sunday because most places were packed. One of the worst places I've been to. Their food was terrible and was just overwhelming. And we asked what the waiter thought was good, but it wasnt wat we hoped for."}
{"text":"Maybe because its the holiday but have been waiting for over an hour for my pho.  Only bus boy was attentive with our drinks.  Had to ask for waiter on several occasions but got ignored. Bus boy took our orders.  Very disappointed with the service. Never coming back if they paid me."}
{"text":"OOHMYGOODNESS! This place is freaking amazing! They have won me and the fam over; we're never going anywhere else for pho. It's just something about the brawth  I've had seafood pho before, but this was just insanely good. And full of seafood. Big chunks of white fish, baby octopus, squid, and crab. Can't wait to go back for more ,"}
{"text":"I had the C6 with chicken and it was a bounty of food. The food was prepared to perfection and the taste was amazing. Pot stickers were to die for can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Second time dining here tonight and I must say that I was impress yet again. We dined here about a week prior and I fell in love w/ their pho! The broth is perfect and it gives off this nice aroma. Had their stir fried vegetable w/ egg noodles and this portion is huge(feeds 2). Service was on point yet again, which I am thoroughly impressed with because it's not common to dine at an Asian restaurant in Chinatown and expect to get checked on by the servers. The manager even came by and asked us how everything was tasting. Definitely going to be a regular here!"}
{"text":"I really should finish my food because I am starving. ...but everything just taste so old. Not sure how they're defrosting their food but don't order stripe with your pho. I'm afraid if I continue eating might be spending the rest of my day in the restroom. .......

On the brighter note...nice tables and chairs! Very clean too. Pretty good service and the air conditioning feels good. That's still not enough for me to come back though."}
{"text":"First time here. Nice ambiance. Good service. Had the beef steak n flank pho. Very good. Could have used more sides for the soup.Also had the egg rolls which were tasty. Thai Tea is excellent. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Their pho tastes okay. I like ordering their kids meal since I can't finish their regular-sized bowls. Sometimes their server would let me have it, sometimes they won't and their reason is that it's only for kids 12 and under. Their service has always been friendly, then again it might be because my friend is friends with the owner. I'm glad they opened one closer to the strip so when my friends and I are done having fun clubbing or drinking or whatever, we just drive down Spring Mtn and end up slurping on pho here at Jenni. I've only ordered their Pho Tai but I think I might try their other items on my next visit, like their rice dishes. I like their facility, it's really clean unlike other pho places I've been. Jenni Pho might not be my first choice when I'm craving pho, but it's a good enough place."}
{"text":"This place sucks.. Pho itself is ok not super.however, workers here sucks... They messed up our order so one of us had to wait while rest of us were eating. Also, food comes out so late here. No fried rice until 5pm.. Wtf!!!"}
{"text":"I love vietnamise food, and the friendly staf of this place. Thank you Greg, Anne, Martha, Bao, tina, Tony and Jenny..."}
{"text":"i dont eat pho very often but when i do its always pho so 1. This time i was convinced that i should check out jenni pho so i did and wasnt impressed. Just the typical pho i can get from a hundred different pho places around town. Pho choices are limited, they dont have the beef cartilage i normally enjoy with pho. I did like the uneven cut of the noodles letting the eater know that theyre hand made...nice. the broth was just ok for me. Next time ill try something from the grilled menu. The restaurant itself was nice and the service was friendly. I especially like the open kitchen"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for awhile now, simply because I think the name is clever.  Jenni-pho = Jennifer. Since my name is Jennifer, I thought I owed it to myself to eat pho here.  Their menu isn't extensive.  Good or bad, not sure, but I wanted more variety with Vietnamese food.  I don't even think there were any banh-mi's on the menu, but I could be wrong. The service was good...two different people helping us which is always nice!  

In any case, their pho bowls are HUGE.  plenty of food for a full meal dining in, and another for taking home.  I thought it was a huge plus for them that they have kids meals for pho, with steak or meatball.  Their spring rolls were good, and I wanted to take their peanut sauce in a jar.  I can't really comment on broth, because to me, it tastes the same everywhere.  Hoping to visit again here in the future to try other stuff!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite Pho restaurant and has become our family's \"go-to\" comfort food spot over the past year. Today they packed up a meal for me to take to my mom who has been in the hospital for the past month. Thank you so much! It was a wonderful surprise for her and she loved it. She can't wait to get out of the hospital and eat at her favorite place for Pho."}
{"text":"My brother introduced me to this place a little over a year ago.  We come here because the food is great and we need a place to meet and eat after we close our business on Saturday nights.  The food is good, but the service was lousy!  operative word \"WAS\"  I stayed away for a bit because the service was lacking with long wait times, if the food even came at all, no refills, just bad service.  We went in the other night I was craving menu item C6 (Grilled Pork Chop and Shrimp) and was pleasantly surprised.  Our waitress was delightful and with Jenni's hubby as the chef the food was better than ever.  Happy for the change in staff.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"This place has THE BEST BUN RIEU in Vegas, Henderson and North Las Vegas.  I have tried Bun Rieu at Pho Kim Long, Pho Little Saigon, Pho So 8, Pho So 1, and Pho Mai Lan and all were nothing but dissapointing.  It also has the most refreshing Durian smoothie ever.  They use real durian and condense milk, not powder and sugar.  Jenni Pho Grill has nice decor and clear glass wall kitchen so you could see kitchen staff in action.  Travis - our waiter was super friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.  Unlike other Vietnamese and Asian restaurants in Vegas, Jenni's restroom is clean.  We will definitely go back to try other dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"My first time here. Customer service was immediate; almost as if there were expecting me. Both waitresses (Hanna and Hiely), working had great customer service. My waitress was Heily. She was very interactive, makes great eye contact, super attentive and gets to the point of getting exactly what you ordered in a timely manner. 
Half price apptizers and drinks from 4-6pm! 
Food was great! Please was decorated very well! And most of all, customer service was smiling/helpful faces!"}
{"text":"Awesome place!!! Very friendly and quick service, not to mention everything is beautiful. I love it here.  Must come thru and check it out"}
{"text":"I hate giving bad reviews but this place will get one. Food is mediocre at best and the service was terribly slow.  I had to ask 3 different servers for water and extra plates/bowls. It was like pulling out teeth.  I won't go into how long we waited for food.  It wasn't a pleasant time."}
{"text":"Excellent service, great food. Very good quality. We'll be back the next time we're in town."}
{"text":"I know a lot of people aren't big on Jenni Pho--either their original location on South Rainbow or this newer Spring Mountain location. But honestly, it's absolutely and positively A-OK with me.

OK so that's not a ringing endorsement. I'm just not that picky when it comes to pho. I've only had it once where it was so bland that I didn't enjoy it (and even then it wasn't terrible). Jenni Pho's isn't the best in town, but it's good enough. And they do give a generous amount of meat, which I appreciate quite a bit.

So I'd probably give them an A-OK Yelp rating. I'm adding an extra star for their delicious Jenni Pho Dessert drink. We took advantage of the buy-two-get-one-free offer. I had to fight the urge to not drink my second one until we got home. It didn't last long after that."}
{"text":"SO MUCH FLAVOR!!! Because they use a crap load of MSG. I was so thirsty after my meal it felt like I had a salt lick for dinner. I can't say it wasn't tasty but not worth downing a gallon of water later. 
The portions are large, if you need a lot to get full it works. Service is lacking, I saw other tables look around for a server so they could order, it took us a while to wave down someone to ask for extra soup... which seemed to confuse the waitress so she asked our original male server to come back and confirm that we wanted extra soup... he said OK. Near the end of the meal it finally came, we thought they forgot about it and didn't feel like asking again. But load and behold when we got our bill they charged us for the extra soup, if you were going to do that you should of told us. Then we can decide if its worth the charge... and you still brought it at the very end when honestly we didn't even care for it anymore. The food was just OK, nothing great. I doubt we will be back again, there are a lot of better restaurants in the area with better service and less MSG. 

If you have a party over 6 they do auto gratuity and its not marked on the receipt (esp. if you paid with a credit card) that has already been charged so careful on over tipping for soso service."}
{"text":"Last year this place was being renovated.  This year I decided to try this place......oh so NOT!!!!  

The decor was nice and very upscale.  But for any upscale place, there was not a napkin laying around.  Seriously people, why am I always having to beg for napkins.  Especially at a vietnamese restaurant.  Deeeyammm!

Peeps note:  when a place advertises PHO as part of their name for their restaurant, try to stick with the pho...hmmmmm other foods the chef specializes is really not his specialty.  I got the noodle with spicy crab and escargot broth..oh so not.  I could not believe how oily the broth was....wow!!  I can lick my lips and the oily film would still be there.  The rice plate with grilled pork, shredded pork, and pork meatloaf was not all that.

Jenni Pho, you ain't.

Not so happy eating!"}
{"text":"By far the worst Vietnamese food I have ever taste. I don't think this place can last much longer."}
{"text":"I'm from OC. Pho is bland. Grilled pork salty. Service sucks. Not kids friendly. Didn't provide sissor to cut up Pho. Overall not good."}
{"text":"I honestly don't know where to start. 
I'm just happy I didn't see this on the dirty dining report. 

Why is the rainbow location so much better?! Well here's why:


The broth was brown, never in my life have I seen such dark pho broth. I asked our server and he said reason for that is \"beef broth\". My boyfriend is 100% Vietnamese and he's the reason I have a love for Vietnamese food. We travel to Orange County every week and you best believe I don't leave until I get my $3/bowl of pho! Another thing is the cost!!! $9 for a bowl is ridiculous. I told my friends in Orange County of the ridiculous cost for pho, all of their families are now in debate on opening a pho restaurant. $9 for pho=gold mine!!! 

I would prefer to go to the location on rainbow. The service is faster in my opinion because it's a smaller location. 

All in all this is the best hangover solution. 

Enjoy your meal!"}
{"text":"24 hour Vietnamese sounded so good. I really wanted to like Jenni Pho, but sadly the food was just terrible.

I tried a chicken vermicelli bowl and  pork/shimp broken rice plate. My friend got pho with beef. Aside from the spring roll appetizer which was ok, everything else was so bad it was almost inedible.

The chicken on top of my vermicelli bowl tasted like it had spoiled. I took one bite and had to spit it out.

On to the broken rice plate. This dish wasn't scary bad like the chicken vermicelli, but it wasn't good either. The pork was not trimmed, large pieces of fat hanging off it. Flavors were bland, boring.

I didn't try the pho but my friend said it was way too salty and had so much grease in the broth that she couldn't eat it.

We sent back all three dishes (something I almost never do) and kindly told our waiter what we didn't like about them, including that the chicken tasted like it had spoiled. We were quickly served our bill without any adjustments.

I understand mistakes can happen, everyone deserves a second chance. When it's brought to a restaurants attention that they may be serving spoiled meat and they do nothing about it... well I'm sorry but I'll definitely not be eating there again."}
{"text":"Hi there I recommended this Jenni pho for family and friend all there food is very good come visit this place . plus all staff is very friendly . The filipino guy name greg is really good service"}
{"text":"Open late and good food too.  Staff is very friendly and attentive.  I received a military discount on everything.  Bolba was good and their Pho is not bad as well."}
{"text":"No as good this time.  The meat in the Jenni Pho was not fresh."}
{"text":"There are a ton of great noodle places and....this place is an....

Awesome place. Great food. 

Ambiance- very cool clean and roomy. 5 star. 

Bun Bo Hue -  I love this authentic Hue dish that is so tasty and spicy. They even give you the cabbage instead of bean sprout which is traditional!  5 star!

All other noodles - plenty of meat and nice subtle broth. 5 star

Beef stew - nice asian taste and plenty of chunky bits. 5 star

Pot  stickers - so good we ordered 2 servings. 5 star. 

Service - plenty of help, attention and courteous. 5 star

Check it out!"}
{"text":"Good food but unfair credit card policy with a 20$ minimum and as far as customer service goes - poor is an overstatement"}
{"text":"This place was alright. I liked that it wasn't super packed. The Phõ wasn't bad neither for the price. I would probably come back again for another round."}
{"text":"We had great service from the restaurant.

From: the Tyrone to the Hue! Love u anh huy ! Your the best!"}
{"text":"Service sucks here. Our waiter seemed aggressively rude. Food was okay, pretty much the typical average Vietnamese restaurant. I'd honestly just stick to Kim Long if I need my Vietnamese fix when in Vegas."}
{"text":"Love it !! Their soup and pho, fried rice were so big and good!! I ll def come back here"}
{"text":"I love pho! Again, I LOVE PHO!

With that said, this place is clean, classy and service is good. But I LOVE PHO! It's a shame too. 

Ordered

Beef Flank and steak pho bowl with tendon.

First off , the base is the heart of pho soup. This my friends was more of a beef soup with ginger flavoring. Need I have to say Tinola to all my Filipino peeps? I believe I ordered rare steak also. Why is it thoroughly cooked? I hate adding chili oil, or any condiments for that sake, but it was the only way I can finish my soup. Oh how I wish I hadn't cheated on my Pho Saigon 8. 

Down to the point, if the food tasted as good as thier presentation, then yes, A ok G.I. 2 stars for cleanliness and the classy look, but I'm hungry chef, I want to leave full not sit pretty, or handsome in my case haha... Maybe I'll come back and try their plate dishes, but for now, I'll have to settle for disappointed."}
{"text":"About 10 days ago I gave Jenni a try.  
- I had the Pho Special, it was ok.  For what I got it seemed pricey compared to Pho at other Vegas places.
- I will give them props for having a nice decor/restaurant and cool, open-view kitchen that makes it easy to see the cooks in action.  Service was also excellent.
- I value food over ambiance so I'll probably stick with my tried-&-true Viet eateries or give other places a shot."}
{"text":"Jenni PHOgREAL!?!  I used to be a daily PHO KIM LONG visitor but they started getting rid of stuff from their menu.  This was my first time at Jenni Pho Grill and I enjoyed it.  The prices are decent.  They have very friendly workers and excellent service.  I only tried their PHO and Thai Tea this time around but the very comfortable welcoming atmosphere is definitely the reason I'll come back!"}
{"text":"My very first time having Bun Rieu in vegas! Wont be my last either, its so colorful and vivid and tastes great. The main thing was that it has a very traditional taste. I love Jenni phos food presentation. The service was very fast and friendly I felt very welcome."}
{"text":"I'm not Vietnamese  so I can't say that this is the best place to get Vietnamese food, but I will say my boyfriend and I come here all the time for pho. It's the BEST I have had so far. The bowl is bigger the pho Kim and the service is quick. However, every time I ask for brisket, they give me steak. Its still good, though. On top of that, you DONT have to wait, plus, 20 bucks for two people, I'm sold."}
{"text":"My rating is based on the food and the food alone. You don't go to an Asian restaurant and expect service. Not that the service was bad, it's just like any typical Vietnamese restaurant. Anyway, it was just my bf and I. He ordered the pho dac biet and I ordered the bun bo hue. The pho, I would give it 2 stars. The bun bo hue, in between 3.5-4 stars which got me rating the place 3 stars. Service was ok but what really pissed me off was we ordered one coke, they brought out two and we told them we only ordered one but that server insisted that it's ok but still charged us?! Ok, whatever. I'm not going to argue over something that's $2.00. All in all, I won't be back. Plenty of Vietnamese restaurants to choose from down this Chinatown strip and definitely better pho (pho Saigon 8)"}
{"text":"Here for the grand opening!

They are giving complimentary choice of Pho and pork chop, with a thai tea or soda.

Their pho broth is very \"beefy\" and full of flavor.  Probably the most flavor that i have tried, but some may feel like it is slightly overpowering.  The sides and etc are fresh and delicious...tender meats.

The pork chop was very very tender...pulled apart with fork.  Very good.  Yum!

Service was quick and friendly.  Setting is very nice...lots of nice granite and tasteful interior tid bits...blows away most pho spots decor wise.

Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Called to order spring rolls to go and the butt head on the phone said that they were too busy to help. You have forever lost my money Jenni Pho."}
{"text":"One of the worst service i've had in a while.

3 of us sat on a table for lunch. We placed our order pretty quick but waited forever to get water. From my understanding, Pho is simply broth you pour into a bowl and add meat/veggies. It took our table (of 3 guys) almost 30 minutes to get our order and the place was not at capacity. After we finally got our food, I asked for some cilantro and other stuff on the side. It never came and I wasn't surprised. 

Furthermore, the table next to us had an accident and the baby sitting at their table spilled his food. After the table paid and left, I heard the server (also our server) constantly complain about the party complaining about their service. 

It wasn't hard to see that the service wasn't good and everyone had every right to complain. The Pho was decent but not great and I was starving waiting for my food. Probably better pho places around the area."}
{"text":"First off ive given this restaurant 3 chances...the reason why we go there it's because they do have boba as well so it makes it easier to kill two birds with one stone. But you guys need work I'm the type that enjoys pho at least one or twice a week and it's lacking...what type of Vietnamese restaurant doesn't have spring rolls?  Annie Pho all day people get it right and save a couple bucks because it's pricey for pho anyone that tells you this place is the best doesn't know pho.."}
{"text":"Always the best choice of dinner around this winter time. There's enough of variety for those who are not so in to pho and get dragged here. Lol"}
{"text":"I love this place so much. Service is stellar, prices are good, quantity gigantic, and overall nice vibe. 

Only downside is they changed their hours and now close at 2am every day. I will miss the 4am pho. :("}
{"text":"Well they sat the 5 of us down and it's been oh 5-10mins and they haven't even came to take our drink order. It's Saturday afternoon and it's not like it's busy.
Pho taste water downed and no flavor, there's 3 other pho spots on this same street that I think I would rather try at this point. 
Gave them 2 stars because after the servers  acknowledged us they were pretty on point and courteous."}
{"text":"We came on a Saturday evening and ordered 
1. Pho with rare and well-done beef, 9.79
2. Vermicelli with shrimp, pork, and egg roll, 9.79
for 23 

- Doors opened for us. Seated right away.
- Clean. nice seating. Not your sloppy Viet restaurant on spring mtn, You know it's already better when they give you a water cup in a glass rather than on plastic cups. haha. 
- Too Americanized. Sounds like a starbucks. haha. 
- Pho broth was great. Meat was tender. Not much fat. This pretty much what separates any Viet restaurant. A bit expensive for a bowl of pho. 
- noodles stayed consistent. didn't get hard. 
- Pork was flavorful. Didn't need much sauce.
- good portions. 
- Service was nice and attentive. Not busy."}
{"text":"Very nice place to eat at. Very good food especially the charbroiled pork that I always get."}
{"text":"Very good pho
Courteous staff that worked together well 
Clean , you can see the kitchen plainly"}
{"text":"good food, bad service.
I enjoy their pho and I love the stuff they have on the table! a few things I enjoy in my pho are chili oil and pickled jalapenos, and this place is one of the very few that have it! I'm afraid that's it though.. although the food is good, the service is just.. absent. I once went there and the servers kept walking by us, not bothering to check on us. after trying to get someone's attention and being ignored for about 15 mins, (the place was empty! there was only one other man eating there!) my uncle went up to the front desk to ask for assistance. even after that, it took about maybe another 5 mins before someone actually paid any attention to us. we ordered, then my uncle's pho came relatively quick. I ordered pho too, but for some reason it took longer. I eventually received my pho. my uncle asked for a side of onions, but felt like no one remembered, so asked again. not only did they bring the onions when we were already done eating, (the place was still empty! I don't understand how not one person was assisting/serving us!) but they also charged my uncle for the onions that he didn't even end up eating.. 
my friend told me she goes at night all the time and their service isn't bad, so maybe just don't eat here during the day time, unless you don't care about customer service.."}
{"text":"The house tea is great and only $0.50! We really enjoyed this place. We shared the Jenni Pho Special and had the spring rolls as an appetizer. They are open late."}
{"text":"Bad service. I assume since we had a big group and they automatically got their tip, they didn't even try to provide good service. I ordered 5 meat combination, but they only gave me 4 kinds. We had 8 people there, the waitress only brought 5 cups, and never showed up again. We also asked for two cups of got waters, we never get those either. About the flavor, among all the pho I tried, it is just about average or little below."}
{"text":"A few nights ago my friend and I came in during a power outage sometime around 11pm. Both of us only had card and since the power was out on the whole block, we obviously weren't going to be able to use an ATM. I asked the waiter, who was standing by the door at the time, if they were still open and if we could pay with card. He said yes that they could only make the pho and were still accepting cards. So my friend and I order one chicken pho each, that were going to be paid for separately. (Btw the power was out our whole meal, but thanks for still serving us) After our meals they asked us to come to the counter so we could pay with our cards. The waiter then took down my friend's and I card information on slips (because again, we were paying separately) and when they took it down, they wrote down the expiration date, security codes, everything. He then said that it was going to be charged later when everything is back to working. Well, that would've been nice to know before our meal as having all my card info just written down isn't something I'd like to think about. Basically I didn't see the charge for a day or two, and when it finally showed up in my bank account today I was charged $20.09 when I only ordered one pho. I called to find out why I was charged double, and talked to the manager who said that what had happened was that an employee lost the slip with my friend's card info and charged both pho's to my card. She then told me \"my friend owed me $10.\" I mean I don't mind paying for my friend's pho. But still I don't think this was handled very well as now all of her card info is just around somewhere and I wasn't told I was going to be charged $20. Anyways, I'm very unhappy with how the manager handled this situation and the fact that they lost her card info and didn't take responsibility for it. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"The place was clean but service wasn't that great. We were halfway done with our pho and it took long for the pot stickers, spring roll and mango smoothie. While we were still eating the waitress took the soy sauce and another sauce from the table and took it to another table. That was rude!!! We had to remind the waitress for food we were waiting for. I would not go there again."}
{"text":"This is our go-to place to eat.  I typically get the Vegan Tofu Pho.  I always bring half of it home with me.  

In the heart of Vegas China Town, it's worth the drive or any other location."}
{"text":"Service attitude is very bad, do not go, the takeaway is the deterioration of chili sauce"}
{"text":"Jenni Pho has a great selection on their menu... They also have a happy hour special where a few of their appetizers are half off... I always like the fresh spring rolls that they make. The vermicelli cold noodles (bun), pho dac biet (Jenni pho)... Omg and you can choose to get a super size bowl of pho if you like or add any extra toppings...I also like the fact that they have boba drinks too... Very affordable food and I like it a lot! Service was also great... Will definitely come back..."}
{"text":"Being Vietnamese I'm a little more picky when it comes to taste but the reason I gave it one star is because the food is ok.  Nothing great but not horrible either.  

The service on the other hand is the WORST.   It's a Saturday lunch time and there are only two other tables beside us and there are 4 people standing chatting at the register.  It took over 10 minutes for them to bring me a coke (which I had to remind the server that I ordered). My family also ordered the special Jenni drink which is buy 2 get 1 free ... so after they brought us the coke I asked how about the 3 Jenni drinks we ordered when we got here ?  He goes and checks and comes back and tells me they are all out.  It would've been nice for someone to tell us instead of just sitting here waiting for it.

Literally the only time we saw the servers is when we ordered the food and then when they served it to us.  If you want a refill on your drinks or napkins or anything else you better flag someone down because they sure aren't the ones that are going to be checking on you.  

I live in the SW part of town and the JenniPho on Rainbow is awesome so since I was on Spring Mountain I decided to try this location and let's just say it will be my first and last time."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place gets some crummy reviews. Every time we've been here, it's been very good. The pho is great, and i know since I've tasted the real thing in Hanoi. The rice dishes are also tasty, especially the grilled pork. Their menu is typical for viet places in the US, lots of choices for pho and noodle bowls, yummy smoothies. Staff is usually friendly and attentive. I think its better than pho kim long, though the latter is not bad."}
{"text":"This is my pho spot. The consistency is on point. My chicken pho with potstickers is the combination I go. 

In addition to the great food, I really dig the decor - wide space, clean tables, huge windows to the outside and inside the kitchen! 

Oh yeah, and if you use it, the wifi id is Netgear40 and password is Niftytable543 ...until they change it."}
{"text":"the worst vietnamese restaurant i have ever been too!!! food portion is small! 

jenni husband is a plain rude restaurant owner i have ever met instead of fixing the issues he told my server to tell me the jenni pho rainbow location portion is a wrong serving portion and he keep on staring me down instead like he about to start a fight with me!!! this place is a joke and i will never wver going to step my foot inside this restaurant ever again!!! 

even my server is another rude ass person!!! on top of it this jenni pho location over priced!"}
{"text":"I do believe this place deserves the 3 star rating. It is an A-OK place to come and eat when you are like really hungry.

The pho was mediocre...the customer service needs some work big time.

I saw one of the cooks scratch his head and then continue making some pot stickers...nice work...they need to practice food safety a little more."}
{"text":"The lemon grass chicken was awful.  There was no taste of lemon grass, just burnt thick soy sauce, burnt chicken and lots of molasses. SKIP the buy two get one free Boba milk tea at $5.25 each. You can get a larger drink and softer Boba elsewhere. the broken rice with BBQ pork was good though! Hedy was very nice as usual, but the other blond waitress did not return our change and gave herself a big TIP..."}
{"text":"We have somehow settled on this place as our go-to pho spot.  It's not necessarily that they have the tastiest pho, I would say they are on par with any other joints we determined to have good pho.  I guess it's the comfort of it - big but fairly cozy - combined with attentive service, cleanliness, and clean tasting soup.  Whatever it is, we have come here the last 4 times we wanted pho.  So, this is now our pho restaurant in Vegas.

Table-for-1 Factor:  As with most pho joints, it's made for dining alone."}
{"text":"Soak toilet paper noodles and the broccoli in the vegetarian pho felt like they were cut using a dog :) 
enough said ... 
The server was a really cool dude late at night ..."}
{"text":"Since my last review I can come back and honestly say that this place is actually my favorite spot again I have been addicted to the flavors. I don't know if those little green leaves are basil anymore because they really have me hooked! Lol"}
{"text":"It was good, my first time having it but I can't say it was so good I'll be back. The atmosphere was really nice but our service lacked. They were not very friendly, didn't ask us what we wanted to drink just brought water. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I was excited to try Pho here since they opened after hearing about it and passing by after it opened, the Yelp reviews were promising as well! I went with fellow Yelper Heather S. as we were in the mood for hot soup on that cold night! 

The decor is nice, bright and clean and I like the open view kitchen so that you can see the cooks moving about while making every ones food. 

I was in the mood for something with shrimp in it and for Pho there were only two options for seafood. They had the seafood Pho which had, shrimp, scallops and imitation crab or Tom Pho which is what I ordered that only had shrimp.

The Pho noodles and the broth were good however my little shrimps had been cooked to death, overcooked then filled in a bowl with boiling hot water just killed it as those shrimps never had a chance to be good. That is a pet peeve of mine, over cooked seafood is a deal breaker and will ruin a meal as shrimp should not be hard as a rock and chewy. I do not suggest ordering the Tom Pho.

I did like the fresh spring rolls with the peanut dipping sauce and my lychee flavored iced tea was a winner.

If you do not see a combination that is listed you do have the option to create your own up to three meats.

There is no ATM in this restaurant, they refer you across the street of crazy busy spring mountain to a Wells Fargo bank ATM. I have no idea why previous reviews state there is an ATM located inside of the restaurant when there is not. 

Also no credit card transactions are accepted for less than 20.00 so it made it sort of complicated for us going dutch."}
{"text":"4 stars for service and cleanliness! 

Every time I come here, I get phenomenal service. I think it's because we always come late nights (like after midnight-4am). Their store is always clean and they probably have one of the cleanest and good smelling bathrooms. Bathrooms are important to me, lol. It's always a good place to go when you're hungry and craving pho. Their night server (Calvin) is so friendly and one of the nicest waiters I've ever experienced in town. This review is especially for you, bro! He has been our server for the past like...five times we've gone there. And he's always serving with a smile. We're always seated fast and orders are taken quickly. The food comes out in a good amount of time. And the A/C is blasting so it's cold up in there. Perfect for a pho shop! I love the broth and noodles. The rare steak is good too. Oh and they have a dumpling special, two for one pot stickers. Awesomeeeeee. I've had their strawberry smoothie which is thick and their boba is tasty! Not hard or bland. Definitely a place we will always keep coming to when we get hungry at night."}
{"text":"Other than it's semi named after me, I got the Bun nam shrimp dry noodle. It was pretty good, nothing to complain about flavors were right when it comes down to the food. Service wise it was hard to get their attention."}
{"text":"This is my to go to place the next day after a drinking session or late night craves.. I love how they are open late nights, love the staff, and good food, portion and quality."}
{"text":"Starving and ready for some late night grub, we made our way here. I didn't have any expectations, but knew I wasn't really in the mood for pho, so me and my fella shared a broken rice plate, some spring rolls and eggrolls.

Food came out quickly and service was very friendly. Even though it took us a while to figure out what we wanted to order, they checked back on us regularly, but didn't rush us. The eggrolls and spring rolls were solid, although after two weeks on a low carb diet every carb I tasted was amazingness. The broken rice plate was ok. Meat was a little overcooked but nothing bad and had ok flavor. Same with the shrimp and egg. 

Overall, this meal was nothing mind-blowing but was solid and just what we needed when we were hungry and in a rush."}
{"text":"I like this place, it's clean, friendly, tasty. I've never heard the servers tell me \"No, we don't do that\". Favorite lunch spot."}
{"text":"Wow... came her on a saturday night 8 tables, 2 waiters, poor service. I decided to bring the family here to try something new. We live walking distance to the one on Rainbow and warm springs. This location lacked the service and hospitality I get from the rainbow location. First of all our waitress didn't write our orders down. So, when our orders came the combination/make your own pho was not what we ordered. Wouldve said something to the waitress but we never saw her again. Nobody checked up on us, nobody refilled our drinks, but when we were done they were sure quick to take our payment for their below par service.  Sticking to the rainbow location from now on. Oh and btw jenni pho and jenni pho grill are no different. The menus are identical."}
