{"text":"The buffet is very inexpensive and the lady who served me is friendly, but the food -- well, this is the only buffet I've been to where I didn't return for seconds, and had a hard time finishing what I did take from the serving trays. The  selections were limited, the appearance of the food lacked appeal, and unfortunately that was also reflected in the taste of the food."}
{"text":"This was my fave place since 1993..I am forever searching other Chinese places in hopes they serve same type of food..so far I have not been able to find exactly same..the sweet and sour pork, and the chicken chow main (but ask wout soy sauce) closest to that taste is at best Hong Kong dining in Mesa. I'm still looking for the veggies, and egg rolls..anyone know other places?? I was very upset when I pulled up to that huge thank u for your patronage sign...and keep hoping the family will read these reviews and help us out! I wish they would've just bumped up the prices before giving up! I so would've paid the same as any other large chain buffet which I can't stand them! Oh the good old days..."}
{"text":"Like Kris H., my family has also been coming here for many many years. The food is great, the service is very warm and welcoming. my family would take the whole back section that was closed off to the rest of the dining room and we'd put the tables together and fit as many as we could. some of my earliest memories were there, my mother's as well. Will be in my future children's memories for sure."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, as Jennifer P. posted they have closed :( anyone know if the chef is cooking for a new restaurant?"}
{"text":"An old school Chinese buffet, family run, retains the vibe of before the mega chains took over in the 1990s. Him's is pretty average quality. David Kwan's on 43rd and Dunlap was the best old school Chinese buffet. But they have been out of business since about 2006.

Him's orange chicken and sweet and sour pork are good when fresh, otherwise they get dried out. The hunan chicken is good. The fried rice is not bad. The lo mein lacks flavor. The ribs are very good but they only have them for dinner. It's a limited selection on the salad bar. Despite being a buffet, this is not a place to go for variety. It's very small. When I do eat here, I usually get the same 4-5 things over and over again. Basically a local hole in the wall.

The old woman owner is a bit daft. I've been coming here for years and she will still insist on asking for my ID when paying with a VISA. That's annoying. Overall the food is not \"good\" but it's usually \"ok\", and it's cheap and I'll eat here when I'm in the mood. 

If you want a better menu based but still inexpensive Chinese restaurant, I recommend Ming and Gee on the south side of Glendale one block west of 43rd Ave."}
