{"text":"I love their pita burgers. If it weren't for high price I would go to showmars more regularly. $10 for a burger, fries, and drink is a little too much imo for a restaurant only a grade above your average MCDonald's. I cant deny their pita burger is good though. It's why I come back sometimes and order."}
{"text":"Come here often on my lunch customer service is good usually I get their salads and it's always very good especially I  like the edible bowl it comes in.."}
{"text":"This location makes the BEST Greek salad with gyro out of all the other Charlotte locations! So glad it's close to home! They aren't skimpy like a few of the other locations tend to be and the meat is always cooked perfectly and not dry and overdone!"}
{"text":"Go to showmars all the time(love the grilled chicken on pita) but this time was the absolute worst. I guess we came to late in the evening. The staff was barely paying attention to us. It was 3 1/2 of us(the 1/2 is my little niece) so we needed a high chair for her. I had to get it myself because they never brought it. 

The manager(I assume he was the manager) and the staff were having what seemed to be a tiff at the cash register. They were all taking pretty loud. So unprofessional and rude to be doing that in front of guests. He was counting it down they register at the time(maybe something wasn't adding up but he seemed pissed). 

I asked the waitress for sauces after we were seated and never got them. I had to go to the counter to get it. The fries was cold and no one really liked their meal. I was disappointed all around with this location. I usually go to the one on east blvd or 7th st (so much better)! 

Maybe it was just a bad night but I won't ever go back to this one again. Ugh. Even the one on Freedom is way better than this one. Ugh. It used to be so much better a few years ago."}
{"text":"Great fastfood with a Greek touch. You won't find it anywhere else. The only fast food that has pita burgers."}
{"text":"I entered the Showmars today around 12:30 no one was in line before me to order. So I walked right up to the counter the lady that took my order was an older lady she was very sweet. I I placed my order.  the female that brought out my order she just sat the plate and  took my number tent. I noticed throughout my sit down she was going to other tables asking them do they need refills or anything she never once came back over to my table. So when I was getting ready to leave she was up at the front talking to one of the other co-workers and I had to get my own refill and I was not told to have a good day or anything. Oh well my first and last time here. The customer service was not good except for the ordering part. I guess since I was sitting by myself I didn't get checked on. Think I could've received better service at Wendy's."}
