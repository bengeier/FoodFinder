{"text":"this place is awesome! i will drive all the way across town for the mac and cheese. its flavor is on point and the breadcrumbs on top give it a good crunch."}
{"text":"Amazing environment, bartenders are fantastic and food is incredible. It has a a great vibe with a lot of \"regulars\". They also host charity drives to help the community....who can't love that!? Definitely a great place to escape."}
{"text":"Jeremy is the best! Drink specials(happy hour)are great. Nice neighborhood bar. I would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"I stopped by the Den with my sister after work. Very comfortable environment and nice server and good food with reasonable price. It is very close to my house and enjoyed the music as well. Will be back when I have a chance.."}
{"text":"Full bar except we wanted to play/gamble and everyone is sitting in front of machines not playing. Bartender came over & served promptly, but didn't introduce herself and didn't offer menu. We wanted to eat, but no menus out & bartender never came back. People loitering outside in and out of running vehicles (sketchy). Graffiti all over bathroom mirrors is a major bad sign for such a decent neighborhood. Read good reviews but didn't see evidence of why. Too many other places near by to take a chance again, sorry."}
{"text":"One side is the bar - one side is  the restaurant with amazing food.  Seriously great dining/food/service in the most unassuming place. Their price fix New Years' Eve menu was off the hook good (beef wellington/ lobster tail, grilled salmon, fried seafood platter - with salad, soup, dessert all for $28.00) - It was the deal of the century with terrific service.  This is a gem of a place with reliably great food, service and menu selections.  If you're in the area - be sure to give them a try.  Absolutely a great value with excellent food and a cozy atmosphere -- we love a good booth."}
{"text":"stopped in for breakfast at 7am.   Took the advice from the bartender Jessie and it was amazing.  The bar was so clean.  I have been coming here for over one year.  The staff is amazing."}
{"text":"My new favorite neighborhood bar conveniently located right off the 215.  I love playing 4 card keno here and the menu not only has tons of options but everything I've had was great.  The new bartender Jade is my favorite, as she always has me cracking up and never lets my glass get empty;)"}
{"text":"The Den is an awesome hang out! Friendliness bartenders in town! The food and atmosphere rocks!"}
{"text":"The Den LV was super laid back and chill to hang out in! Stopped by there for a quick beer and bite of food and the bartender Eric was super friendly and quick with service! Got some breakfast for our mid afternoon snack and it was super yum. The environment is friendly and not super smoky in there and super laid back spot to go to. Will be back!"}
{"text":"We like to try new places and love to give local, hole in the wall places a try so decided to try The Den. We sat ourselves in the restaurant area per the sign at the entrance. As we did, an employee at the far end of the room made eye contact with me and smiled so I knew he saw us in there, and let's face it, my daughter isn't exactly the quietest child on the face of the earth, so even the bartender in the next room heard her. We sat and waited, and waited and waited some more but nobody came...not one person. After waiting for 15 very long minutes, we decided we were hungry and it didn't look like we were going to get fed there so we walked out. I don't think we will be back, especially after 2 employees ignoring our presence."}
{"text":"I want to love this place! It's close to home, the bartender was chill. They have shuffle board, pool and darts!

I started with a house salad. It was great. Radish, cucumber, croutons, onion. Fresh. 

My only issue was that I ordered a chicken wrap and it literally had about 1oz of chicken. Like... Diced. Next time I'll definitely ask for EXTRA chicken because the wraps overall flavor was on point. 

I also had the asparagus, which I enjoyed. However $7.50 is too pricey. let's be real.

I would def come back- I just hope the owners read this and make note."}
{"text":"This bar has the worst service I've ever encountered. The food has taken a downward spiral also. Save yourself the time and aggravation, go somewhere else. The bartender seems too busy yet there's 8 people in here. The waitress only comes and checks on us once every 30 minutes."}
{"text":"Eric and Jeremy at Den in Summerlin treat us like family. The greetings are always with a smile. I don't always order food but I highly recommend it. The chef is on point. The remodel has this place looking fresh and new.  I promise you'll enjoy every minute and feel like family too!"}
{"text":"YESSSSS!! I can't get enough of their Tatchos!! The tator tots are perfectly crispy. They chicken in top is like a smoky crispy delicious flavor the guac and sour cream mixed with the nacho cheese is EPIC! I'll go back just for a plate of those!! We also had the meatloaf with veggies and potatoes; the meatloaf had a nice flavor and the veggies were tasty. My husband had the California Melt; he liked it, it was good but he didn't love the waffle fries; he thought they  were too crispy. I thought they were good. They seemed like they were battered and then fried and i like that. Our server was attentive without being annoying. We love that this place is within walking distance of our home. We will be back."}
{"text":"They changed their name from Off The Strip to The Den and it's still a great place with great food. I usually go on graveyard shift to gamble and have a few cold ones. Brad the graveyard bartender is awesome. He always makes sure my glass is full and keeps me entertained with great conversation."}
{"text":"Just had the barbecue combination plate...to go. Incredibly good. Chicken,pulled pork slider and a few ribs. I have to say it all surprised me. Usually we go to Rollin Smoke. No comparison. The bar is up beat and bartenders are totally on it. Good stuff. Customers are all very friendly, all walks of life. Yep, check it out."}
{"text":"My go-to bar when I'm around this location. Been coming here for 5+ years, previously called Off The Strip. There has been some turn overs with the Bartenders here past few years. Food selections are above par, the machines are were lot more \"forgiving\" in the past compared to now. There are some relaxed bartenders here and some tight bartenders but once you get to know them they are all chill here. The shuffleboard is a great amenity here. They also have darts, buckshot and pool. Pretty good music sometimes depending on the bartender. Love the stiff drinks!! Kudos to you know who. This is still my favorite neighborhood bar."}
{"text":"Same great food Off the Strip always had! 
Not sure why yelp hasn't connected The Den to their link but not much has changed besides the name & some of the staff...
Try the burgers - they're amazing! Or the asparagus wrapped in sirloin ... Ooh or the crab cakes! Everything is awesome!
Plus the staff has much improved"}
{"text":"I'll never go here again! Don't play the jukebox cause the stupid bartender will skip your music if he doesn't like it. And has nothing to say other than \"it's the bartenders choice\". Well guess what if you don't like the music playing take it off the jukebox! I payed money for that. Terrible service for a local! This is prob why they keep changing names cause they suck. Their pool tables are crooked and the sticks are warped hiding behind the buck hunter machine and if you wanna play darts you're in the way of the people playing pool. Poor setup and crappy bar. Like I said I'll never step foot inside there again!"}
{"text":"Amazing went here at 4am because not many options this late, grad we went. Bartender was helpful with food knowledge. There's heAlthy food options too. I ordered the chicken club spinach wrap so delicious and fresh. My friend got the quesadilla she loved it! Definitely coming back even tho I only visit vegas once every couple months!"}
{"text":"My husband and I come here off and on, the food is great. We haven't had bad service always a different bartender, but expected when we come randomly and rare."}
{"text":"Good food, good staff, just a really good bar and grill!   Love their pizzas with their thin crust. I am never disappointed!"}
{"text":"Been ordering from this place for over a year now. We always order large pizzas and numerous other items...never had a problem until tonight. 

First off, they didn't tell us that they changed their large pizzas to \"all one size\". The large pizza is now a 9 inch personal pizza!! Are you kidding me?!? 
That barely feeds one person! 
They didn't give us our extra ranch for our chicken fingers that we asked for(and were ok with paying).
They gave us hardly any fries--the bartender was rude as hell too! He acted like he was being bothered. So sorry dude. 
We are in the food and beverage industry as well, we are great tippers and have been loyal customers that have spent a TON of money there this past year. 
New management--No Bueno! 
To add insult to injury, this measly crap was almost $50! SMH."}
{"text":"Stopped here with friends around midnight sunday. Jesse greeted , served , entertained and educated us nevada laws. Lols. Great bar with stiff vodka sodas. We will be back for the home made italian food which is made from scrtach . Jesse was super cool . Tip the man , please."}
{"text":"This is an excellent locals bar with great gaming! There are many TVs to watch your game of choice. The menu has a variety of bar room style food, with specials during football games. I tried the cheese sticks and they were very tasty. They came hot and freshly made. The Video Poker seems pretty loose here. I got a lot of play for the money that I put in. It was a very friendly atmosphere and a great place to stop by for sports viewing."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, good food, GREAT service! Not too crowded on a Thursday night. The server was the best -  really attentive, got the order right, and checked in with us a few times to make sure all was well. Will be back."}
{"text":"The Mac N Cheese is amazing here! I go just for that pretty often. Their menu has quite a few unique options. Their kitchen is open 24 hours which is convenient."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have been coming here for nearly 3 years every Sunday to watch the Eagles games. I'm considering going elsewhere. I'm currently sitting in the restaurant and have been here for over 40 minutes and haven't been served anything, while other customers have entered the bar and been served. Absolutely terrible service by the evening crew! Get it together!"}
{"text":"Stopped by on swing shift last night around 8pm ish. A guy was bartending with tattoos....he was busy flirting with the girls and I could not get a drink. When he did take my order, he stopped and started helping other girls on the opposite side of the bar.

However funny it was to watch him.... I still didnt get my drink...I cashed out and left"}
