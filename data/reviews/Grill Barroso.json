{"text":"Barosso  Service was very nice. We were given water upon arrival and were check on couple of times before we decided what we wanted and during our meal. The server was patient explaining us the menu. A nice touch would have been if she introduced herself. We were sitting outside (must have been the last nice day of the season) so I don't know what is the atmosphere like inside.   We both ordered a plate of lamb chops with soup as entrée. We got our bread basket with butter first.  Bread had nice consistency and was fressh. Butter was ready to be spread on and did not come straight from the fridge. Soup was carrot and was nice and hearty. I especially liked that the plates were warmed up. Next arrived our salad. It was simple salad - lettuce, onions and olives with olive oil. Onions were tasty and olive oil tasted like olive oil (not always the case!). Both of of our mains were done as we requested. Well done and medium. The meat was very tasty and tender but the meat part could have been bigger. Chops looked more like medallions on the plate. It came with a side of house chips that I am not a big fan of but my counterpart enjoyed it. We also shared 1/2 l of red house wine that went down nicely with the lamb. The bill came to $80 for both which is reasonable for the meal and service we received. I would definitely go back and try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were staying in an apartment close by. We'd done a lot of walking that day so we wanted to find a place to eat close by our apartment and were very glad we decided to come here. The food was amazing, we had chicken with rice.  The seasoning on the chicken was very tasty.  The staff there were very friendly as well, and were helpful when we wanted to substitute the fries with rice. I've never had Portuguese rotisserie chicken, and this place has made me a fan."}
{"text":"This is what the first place that I ate at my visit to Montreal and I'm not disappointed. The staff was extremely friendly and the food was great.   keep in mind, it's not delicate French food, it's greasy heavy Portuguese food. If you like that, then you're in. The sausage and surf and turf is absolutely great. The portions are huge and you will not leave hungry.   I love restaurants that give you free things too. We didn't order it, but they gave us free salads. Isn't that a nice touch?"}
{"text":"Best grilled sardines ever! Chouriço was perfect! I had the combo Demi-poulet & côtes levées and it was very great. 3rd time in this place in 5 years. It never disappoints."}
{"text":"Excellent poulet portugais, frites hallucinantes façon chips et que dire des calmars grillés...Tout simplement un excellent resto!"}
{"text":"Friendly restaurant with excellent Portuguese chicken!!! The fries are to die for, they are like potato chips and taste amazing. The chicken is pretty good but maybe not as crispy on the outside as I like it. Lots of combos and excellent if you want to share with someone. Overall great place to eat and I would definitely good back."}
{"text":"Portuguese food in Montreal used to be confined to the Portuguese area (near St-Laurent and Duluth) but with the rising popularity of these grill everywhere in the last few years they are beginning to appear in other neighborhoods. This one is pretty good and I would recommend it whenever you are around."}
{"text":"This meal was excellent... both times on my 2 day visit.  Yeah had to go back again the next day.  Get the combo... ribs (I'm not a ribs person, these were amazing), chicken, the Portuguese fries (sooo good), and salad.  The fries are the star of the show.  They're thick potato chip shaped cuts... prepared perfectly. They're about 3 potato chips thick and are awesome with salt or mayo.  The meats were great too... and the salad was great."}
{"text":"Les patates tranché mince sont vraiment bonne et le poulet aussi je ne connais pas de meilleur places de poulet portugais, les restaurent et bars de la rue ontario commence a m'impressionner de plus en plus."}
{"text":"I'd give them 5 stars just for the chips - they were really to die for. They were the perfect thickness, fluffy yet crispy and amazing with mayonnaise. My chicken was also excellent - my \"thigh\" portion was actually 2 thighs and a leg, all of which had the yummy sauce grilled right into them. I also ordered a house sangria which was very tasty. The service was super friendly.  I might have a new favorite Portuguese restaurant in Montreal..."}
{"text":"Getting tired of St-Hubert chicken? Well come here to eat great fire grilled chicken! This was an amazing experience for me, i really got tired of the rotisserie style of chicken. When I friend brought me here, I really thought I was going to be disappointed. When you walk in the flames are blazing in the kitchen. You can see them cooking on the grill; and you know you are now going to get quality food.   The restaurant might be a hole in the wall, but its quite cozy. When I went, there was almost no one there. People are really missing out here. There is different dishes for everyones tastebuds. Just remember there is a lot of meat that they will cook on a real grill.  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Tout est bon, mais à emporter, c'est encore meilleur!  Je vous conseille vivement le poulet familial accompagné de ses frites/chips, salade et sa bouteille de Sumol, parfait pour un repas en famille quand maman n'a pas envie de faire à manger ou entre amis pour changer de la pizza. Voilà un repas un peu plus santé qui amène du goût dans les assiettes et du soleil dans les curs!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend works nearby, so we visit Barroso often. Victor and is staff always made us feel welcome. I have been to their other locations, but for ambiance, this one is the best. Among all the Portuguese restaurant I've been to, this one is the best. Food is great, portion are generous and prices are fair."}
{"text":"Nice little place with great food. Got the combo of 1/2 chicken and 1/2 rack of pork ribs which came with salad and thick-cut chips. Meat was really tasty, just a tad bit dry, but still very good. It was also a huge amount of food and can easily be multiple meals."}
{"text":"Bring it on!   One of the cool things about visiting a city several times, you can find a somewhat hidden that makes you want to come back to the city. This will be one of those must go to restaurants for me in Montreal. Since I am not an expert in Portuguese cuisine, I can comment about the authentic of the food but I can say that I was a very happy person after leaving.   The menu is quite large with various fish, chicken, beer, and pork options. I ordered the grilled calamari that were out of this world. The food was cooked beautifully and it was very fresh.   The service was wonder. My waitress,  who's name I do not remember but she has a sleeve tattoo, probably was one of the best waiters/waitresses in the city. She was cheerful, funny, and very helpful about the menu.   I cannot wait to revisit this place when I come back to Montreal."}
{"text":"Portions were huge, the good was great and they have a nice selection of private Portuguese wine imports. Staff was friendly even when the restaurant was packed."}
{"text":"My friends and I swung by Montreal, after a weekend in Tremblant.   We ended up in the neighborhood with reservations to Au Petit Extra, but missed the 2:30pm weekday lunch deadline.  The bistro's host was nice enough to recommend Grill Barroso down the block (both are on rue Ontario Est).   Our group of 7 were the only patron, so we were wary.  And Portuguese food in Francophile-friendly Montreal?   We ordered a couple of appetizers (\"entrees\" in Quebec & France), and a bunch of main courses, most meats aside from the grilled sardine & grilled calamari.   The food was not bad!  The hand cut potato chips were the best part of the meal.  On the same block is also another Portuguese resto, called Bistro Le Porto.  This was the first place suggested by Au Petit Extra, but they were already closed for lunch when we arrived."}
{"text":"Ever since the amazing  Le Porto closed down, if I want Portuguese grilled meat near the village, then I go to Barroso's.  I've been here several times now and not once have I had a bad experience. Typical Portuguese grilled fare, chorizo, flank steak, chicken with piri piri sauce, sardines, calamari, shrimp, lamb chops, pork chops, take your pick, go for the mixed grill menu if you're not sure. All comes with salad and home-cut fries.   Prices are very reasonable, the service is friendly, the clientele are pretty lively. Someone in the restaurant had a birthday and we saw the bartender go by with a sparkly candle on a sardine! Also don't miss their natas dessert, the custard tartes portugal is famous for, like mini-creme caramel tartes. The waiter we had was super nice and even gave us a free round of port wine."}
{"text":"Very good Portuguese chicken and octopus. Bring your appetite because the portions are heavy, complemented by a salad and delicious potatoes. The place is not very big, but makes for good group outings."}
{"text":"4 star only for the smoke taste of chicken that i really like mmmmmmmmmmm the rest is just ok for me but i have also to admit that i like the popatos style fries. I think if you order to take out its faster than in tables ..."}
