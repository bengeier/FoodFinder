{"text":"Un bon sushi pour la livraison mais presque un peu trop original : trop de goûts différents on est un perdu dans ce qu'on mange
Mais on lui redonnera sa chance, il le mérite  bien malgré ça!!"}
{"text":"Sadly I can't recommend this place at all. I ordered online and my sushi had hair stuck in it, avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed my experience here last night. The presentation was great; they had beautiful sliced fruit served as accents to the sushi, and the sushi itself was really good. Definitely recommend this place for a casual, cheaper end sushi night (that's still delicious!)"}
{"text":"This is a super cute spot, very small so do not go there if you are more than 4 people. The quality is pretty descent and they deliver which a place.  Oh! It is bring your own wine :)"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from Sozo (using UberEats). The sushi is definitely better than most delivery options in town. A good variety of options. I particularly liked their softshell crab maki (spider) and their fried maki with cooked salmon (dragon eyes). I was less excited by their tuna nigiri and their eel maki roll with lettuce, avocado, roe, and tempura crisps. Regarding the former, mainly because of the quality of the tuna. Regarding the latter, mainly because of the tiny amount of eel in the roll (I could barely taste it). Despite these imperfections, I will most likely order again (for delivery).

Remark: I'd give 3.5 stars here if the option was available."}
