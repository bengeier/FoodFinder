{"text":"Food was very good. Lots to choose from. Couldn't give them a 5 star because customer service was poor. Waitress took our door (there was just the two of us). By the time she got to where she was going, she sent another waitress to ask us again what we ordered because she claims the other waitress forgot. After we got our food which was delicious, we never saw our waitress again. By the way, the lime slices that came with our food was so dry, no juice at all coming out of it - my husband had to get up and go to the front to have new ones sent to us . Every time we needed something, we had to go to the front counter where all the servers were hanging around instead of tending to customers."}
{"text":"Very good service and portions for a lunch menu.  If you are a soda drinker this is not for you as they serve cans at a hefty cost.  Overall, the presentation and cost of the meal were very pleasing and acceptable.  Would recommend."}
{"text":"Just went there and asked for my order then was made to wait for over thirty minutes after that the main clerk noticed that I was trying to peak at the girl who attended on me, it turned out to be that my order was never placed! Then after taking it again and twenty more excruciating minutes I decided to leave, not without the girl on the front desk trying to charge me for a soda that I had even touched! Bad service and no apologies!"}
{"text":"This is one of those places that you would drive by over and over again unless their was someone like me on Yelp telling you that you HAVE to stop! 

In an effort to try all the restaurants and bars within walking distance to our house, we stopped by Morazan. It's no frills place that actually looks like an old fast food restaurant. Pretty much everyone in there spoke Spanish. I think there was only a few waiters/waitresses that spoke English. 

We went for lunch. The menu is very extensive and all the food is Mexican and Central American. Since we were at lunch, we stuck with the lunch menu page, as the prices were really good. Chips and salsa came out and I thought the salsa was very good. I ordered the Bistec Ranchero and my husband got the fajita burrito. Both meals were under like $7! Presentation was really nice. The Bistec Ranchero was the winner. The tortillas were definitely homemade. The ranchero sauce had a kick but it was spectacular! I also loved the refried black beans. Everything was just so tasty. Huge portion as well. We really should have split something! My husbands burrito was very good as well. 

If you are looking for a flashy place, this probably isn't it. However, if you are looking for some crazy authentic food, check this place out!"}
{"text":"Food is decent. Last time I went I didnt like the rice way too hard. I've had the same waiter twice & the same horrible attitude. Seriously if you don't like your job I suggest you find a new one lol."}
{"text":"If I were to judge on the food alone, this place would have 5 stars. The food is exceptional quality! I ordered the Carne Asada Quesadilla and a cheese Pupusa. The Quesadilla had the perfect amount of cheese and steak. It was also grilled to perfection. The Pupusa came with a very mild salsa and a slaw. Both were fresh and flavorful. 
Now the service. I can't remember the last time I had such poor service. We had a young guy (probably the same one who has been mentioned in another review) who looked to be of high school age. I wish I could blame it on a language barrier, but we were with someone who is affluent in Spanish and who had no problem communicating with the server. He never came around to check on us after our food had been brought to the table. My fianc√©e ordered a Pupusa and some double fried tacos. After all the food was brought to the table with hers missing, we assumed the server had forgotten to enter the order. Nope. Apparently that dish just takes longer to cook, but our server never told us. To be honest, he looked like he had no interest in doing anything but talking to the girls that work there. After we were finished eating, it took 15 minutes for him to check on us and then to bring us the check. Tables waited on by the ladies did not seem to have these same problems.
We will go back for the food, but will request not to sit in his section."}
{"text":"Great presentation of food! The pictures of the food brought me in, and were just as pretty in person. Unfortunately, it didn't live up to my taste buds. 

The price was crazy affordable for the budget savvy. Everything all together was $26 Amazing! 

Beverage:
Horchata- Very sweet and had a cinnamon flavor
Water with lime- good!

Cheese quesadilla- with cilantro & onions - Good! Just  had an excess of cheese, & I'm a cheese lover. It was also pretty greasy, the oil dripped off of it. The salad was ok (comes with a red sauce that tastes like a red ranch) this was ok. The other side items are pickled with jalapenos. Yikes, that was a real wake up to my taste buds. 

Shrimp Burrito- my friend thought it was not great, but edible. The red sauce that covered the burrito was surprisingly sweet and my friend didn't like it at all. She didn't touch the rice or salad after the shocking jalapenos made her eyes and nose run. 

Rice- not going to order again! Not great.

Cheese Pupulsa - a cheese filled corn tortilla - if you like corn you may enjoy this. If not, like me, it will sit on the plate."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast. What I've been craving for since moving to Charlotte. Very authentic. Had the carne Asada with eggs and home made tortillas. My SO had the chilaquiles. Huge amount of food but neither one of us left a bite."}
{"text":"Excellent food and staff. The portions are large and the presentation is great. The flank steak is incredible here and is cooked to perfection. The horchata is the best horchata I have ever tasted and I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants fresh, authentic Latin American food in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Terrible costumer service. You have to constantly remind the waiters that they forgot something, like the chips that should be given at each table. The food is good but the costumer services makes this a terrible experience"}
{"text":"Best latin food ever and really cheap. It's a hole in the wall kinda feel, barely speaks english servers but with the big and extensive menu you can never go wrong, tried over 25 dishes for less than $10 and each one is done good. You don't have to speak spanish just point the picture on the menu and you are set. Definitely worth a try and brought over 40 different friends not one said a bad thing."}
{"text":"Great food great prices. People that work here are not the nicest but I just get it to go, everytime."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican/Honduran food in all of Charlotte. Everything is spot on, more authentic, and taste better than other place I have had so far.  The lunch specials are cheap as all heck and you get a lot for what you spend regardless.  The only thing that might throw some people off is that not all the staff speaks English.  So people who come with me usually just either point at something or ask me to request it.  Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"During my dinning visit,  I experienced decent customer service when it came to my waiter,  but the staff in general was really friendly and attentive . 
Food was amazing,  the beans a little salty but other then that it was exquisite. The natural juices were fresh and not from the box , all five of us chose different ones.  Food portion was HUGE. The prices were good and we'll priced on the plate . I would go there again . Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"The service is terrible!!!! They will have you waiting a looooooong time before even daring to take your order. It's like they judge you based on how you look to see if you got money or not.

Too bad for them. They need to learn something really important called customer service."}
{"text":"Morazan serves Central American food at the best price around. Their portions are huge, and the plates are always so neatly garnished. They have an extensive menu that includes Mexican, Salvadoran, Guatemalan, and Honduran food. All the items are described in English and Spanish and includes lots of pictures which help with the language barrier for some customers. I've been here several times and the service is decent, the waitresses often check on our table and the wait on the food is not long. They also have lunch specials that are a steal. Bigger than dinner plates at most places and under $10, and to top it off, their corn tortillas are always hand made. I don't understand why anyone will go and pay twice as much for mediocre Latin food at some of the hipster places around town when this restaurant is so close to the city, particularly South end. The only reason for four stars is because the staff needs some training on personal skills. The body language on some waitresses could be seen as cold or not caring. Most likely it's just cultural. I've experienced the same thing at other ethnic places and don't take it personal."}
{"text":"I only ordered one papusa con queso, since I was in a hurry.  Well, the papupsa came out with a nice portion of repollo too!  The papupsa was large and satisfying.  It was cooked just right.  Next time - I'll be ordering some horchata with multiple papusas.  The service was prompt and the waitress was nice.  I speak broken Spanish, but the cashier is fluent in English.  Todos bien!"}
{"text":"Huge plates of authentic fresh food and friendly service make this place a gem. If I lived in town, I would be a regular. Try the Honduran specials and the drinks. The carne asada was also tasty."}
{"text":"I just get my food to go when I'm I the run and in the mood for platanos fritos and frijoles. So, I'm happy when I go."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly and attentive with several people helping to cover our table.  Food was good, and coffee was actually pretty good, too.  Kids split a steak and eggs combo, and it was plenty of food for them. Server got all our unusual requests correct without writing anything down.  Casual and comfortable with kids."}
{"text":"Clean 
Nice
Great food
Fresh as your going to get in Charlotte 
Incredible food for the money"}
{"text":"This place is dirty !  I always find some type of hair in my food ! The first time I came here with some family it wasn't that bad ,  the food was okay  nothing special , I mostly ate the beef soup or (soap de Rey ) with some Papusas . The only good thing is that they finally renovated the bathroom and there isn't as much drunk men there . Also I would like to add that the service is pretty bad they take forever and the waitresses like to give the stink eye and aren't very friendly ."}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic, delicious Latin  (Salvadorian, Honduran) food... This is definitely a place you want to check out. Outstanding ceviche, fresh tortillas, out-of-this-world grilled steak, shrimp, and chicken. Yummy!
So glad we dropped in...we'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Excellent food and a variety of Latin food and drinks. The food tastes very good so you could say it's authentic for sure. Good customer service as well :)"}
{"text":"This place is so bad about services I have 20 minutes on the table and not 1 server came to say anything. Not water no menu, is terrible here, they have 7 serves on the host for nothing"}
{"text":"Really good food (coming from someone who doesn't even like Mexican food) Service is pretty slow but the large portion of food and follow up service made up for it."}
{"text":"To be honest, I was pleasantly surprised by this place.
We were craving Mexican food, and happened upon this place with Yelp's help as well as proper timing. Most other places that were closer were closed. So whatever, this place had a few reviews.
The exterior isn't something to be admired, but I never count that into a place. If it's got good food and good service, it hits the mark for me. The food was more than I could ask for. The portions were huge, the food was fresh (save one of my enchilada tortillas that was stale on one half), and the plates looked really delicious (plating, garnish, and array of color). The menu was huge, and I could see myself ordering something different every time.
The service left a little wanting. Our waitress didn't come by often which led to empty waters constantly. 
The only reason this gets a four out of five is that the service wasn't top mark, and the one enchilada out of three was slightly stale. 
Would I go back? Most assuredly. This will be my stop for Mexican from now on."}
{"text":"It is due only to my laziness that this is my first review of Morazan (South Blvd location). During our first two visits, the experience was tremendous - a lot of tasty food for the money and excellent service by our waiter (perhaps owner?), who introduced himself as Mario and shook hands all around. He was friendly, patient as we perused the extensive menu, and attentive. *That* review would've been 5 stars. 

We (a family of four adults) returned tonight, and it felt like a Twilight Zone episode...but not one of the good ones. Everything looked the same and the food was still high quality; however, the server had morphed from the esteemed Mario to an 18(?)-year-old who perhaps started his career in the restaurant industry, say, earlier today. He seemed to have not been trained at all. It was not only that he lacked significant social skills, but his poor attention/ memory caused us to get some (minor) incorrect food...even after another server came back to confirm part of the order. But the biggest problem was simply that he clearly had no interest in his job. This included ignoring our party for most of the evening while chatting with the 5+ female servers. 

So, two stars tonight. Please bring back Mario and I will gladly increase this to a 5-star rating."}
{"text":"Stay away from this place. It's run poorly and they don't care about your business. I ordered a simple order of tacos and a quesadilla and they screwed up both. I called to let them know and see what they could do about the order and they hung up on me. I called back and the employee said the Mgr had left for the night???"}
{"text":"I went here with several Hispanics including three Hondurans. This place is a gem.  The portions are huge. The staff were great and friendly. The prices were low considering what you get."}
{"text":"Food was ok.  Whole fried fish was petrified.  Service SUCKED.  I ordered a margarita. If you know me you will understand that I drink the whole thing and I could still speak. I can still feel my lips. I have come to the conclusion it was no alcohol. We asked for the manager who made us another. I asked for no salt in my ankles are swelling as we speak because there was salt.

I'm not coming back. I'll go up the street to the Vietnamese place"}
{"text":"Good spot.  Super cheap. Good food.  Not Tex-mex. Much cleaner cuisine. They had to hunt down the one waitress that spoke English.  Seems to be a legit Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Service was slow and unaccommodating, we never once got a refill on our waters.  We also ordered the mixed fajitas and they came out burnt, we sent it back to the kitchen, and they came out burnt again.  Would not recommend."}
