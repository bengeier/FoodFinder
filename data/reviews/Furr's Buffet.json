{"text":"Cafeteria type buffet. Which is great for me since I'm a slight germ a phobe!  Excellent food and staff.  Low price.  Great location."}
{"text":"I miss this place so much! So Good! Growing up here in California this was the first cafeteria i ever went to. I remember my friend Alex's brother worked there. I tried it cause we went to visit him. They had a location in Claremont CA walking distance from my house. They serve good ole American comfort food and healthy portions of it. Sadly they closed that location and can now only be found in 7 states AZ,TX,NM,CO,KS,AR and OK. We re discovered Furr's when unfortunately my father was hospitalized in Sun City AZ while visiting family. Across from the hospital was Furr's and we would go there before heading back to CA every weekend (My pops could not leave the hospital for many weeks) Furr's was a nice place to sit and enjoys some happy food and clear your head it was easier with all the great staff that would get you refills and more food. Service was good food was great but it did get packed Sundays after church so get there early. Furr's please come back to So Cal I miss you're tasty fried chicken and fresh pies. It was like Thanksgiving everytime I went."}
{"text":"Furrs buffet is kind of a weird buffet because you walk along a cafeteria line and they serve you along the way ,The food they serve you is really good and changes daily the desserts are self serve and amazingly good I love pecan pie and theirs was the best i have ever had.I am going to put Furrs on my top ten list, 9 or 10 but but they will be there."}
{"text":"This place nestled in the heart of Sun City (Senior City) was everything you would expect from an American Style Cafeteria. It was reminiscent of one of my old grade school lunch room cafeterias. Late 70's early 80's LOL everything I chose was good and I left full and happy. While I was there I got into a couple of conversations (like I often do wherever I go) with some old folks that were fun and cool. An easy four stars for this blast to the past that is still ALIVE in Sun City. Rand H, Mike C and I ate and were FULL earlier on the day we were to enjoy the festivities of the Yelp Event \" Science Fair\" I will write about next!! =) JH"}

{"text":"What a great \"Americana\" restaurant! This place brings back so many memories of what used to be very popular restaurant's back in the day ~  the buffet/cafeteria's.  This Furr's is conveniently located just west of the 101 Hwy on Grand and Sun City.  You can tell this Furr's has been around since the fifties based on their sign and building but they have done a very nice job maintaining everything inside and out.    I had a very enjoyable lunch last with some fellow Yelper's; Rand H., Mike C. and Scott W..  This Furr's is a cafeteria however once you go through the line once, you can go back as many times as you like to, all for the same price of $7.39.  I really liked this concept because your not picking through what other the prior people have handled ~ you know what I mean!  You choose what you want and they serve it to you.    They have most of the traditional \"Americana\" food options to choose from.  I recommend when you first go through the line asking for smaller portions and trying more varieties of things.  This way you can refill on what you really like without over stuffing yourself.  Everything was very tasty and fresh.  I'm looking forward to going back to this Furr's so hopefully I will see you there."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with fellow Yelpers Mike C, Rand H, and Arlin B.  I got real excited about the fact they offered liver and onions the day were going and even though I like mine a little on the well done side that particular dish was a real disappointment.  Most of the other dishes were acceptable and better.  While nothing really stood out as great the overall value of the place is very good.  There was enough variety of dishes should keep almost anybody happy.  Being in Sun City most of the clientele is older but there was plenty of working folks there too."}
{"text":"Cannot believe there are no more Furr's Cafeterias out here in Phoenix anymore.   I grew up on Furr's in New Mexico.   My mom would always take me and my sister.  We would always get the chicken fried steak with mashed potatoes and brown gravy, green beans, a Dinner roll, millionaire pie for desert and iced tea.  Or sometimes their baked cod and tartar sauce or their cheese enchiladas with pinto beans.   What were they thinking to go away?  Guess I will have to go to New Mexico and eat at a Furr's there, except I heard it is more like Country Buffet; not at all like how it used to be.   Why do good restaurants have to go away?  I know a lot of people loved Furr's Cafeterias!!!   Please come back!!!!"}
{"text":"Sunday after church, we would head for Furr's.  I remember grabbing a tray and utensils, moving down the line making my own choices for food.  My mom watching but not interfering.  This was when I learned that I could try new things.   Today, the line is just not the same, the food choices are smaller, and hit or miss on quality.  It's changed up to AYCE which makes sense, they did charge per item selected.  So when my husband and I are heading out of town and we come across a Furr's we still like to give it a try."}
