{"text":"Great breakfast/lunch place. The coffee was better than usual. Pancakes that were light and fluffy, but not just air--still had substance to them. My wife had an omelet that she said was very good. Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Great location and atmosphere. After reading a few reviews, the bar was set, perhaps too high. Mediocre eggs Benedict; not much flavour. Great freshly squeezed oj and great maple latte.   Toronto offers far better options."}
{"text":"Breakfast at Evviva did the job of filling me up, but I wasn't overly impressed. The chicken atop my belgian waffle was overcooked, and that's never a good thing. Perhaps a bone-in piece of dark meat chicken, something that's not easily overcooked, would be a better choice. I could have done with a slightly more crisp waffle as well.  It was fun with the views of the CN tower and all, but I can't say that I am in a rush to get back here. If you're hungry it will do the trick, but that's not really ever enough, now is it?"}
{"text":"Went there for brunch today and we were pleasantly surprised!  I ordered the Florentine Eggs Benedict, and it was delicious.  The hollandaise sauce has a very nice flavour. The home fries were very crispy and well-seasoned (way better than Fran's).  They are probably some of the best home fries I've ever had.  The pancakes were soft and yummy as well.  The smoked salmon benny was a disappointment though.  It was fishy, meaning the salmon was not fresh enough.  I was too gross out to eat it.  Service is efficient.  We went around noon on a Sunday and waited about 10 minutes."}
{"text":"The food here was actually pretty good.  The reviews made me think this spot was a dump so I was nervous to go but really wanted breakfast.  Table of two and we ordered chicken and waffle and pancakes with side of bacon.  Fresh fruit accompanied the pancakes. This was perfect for us as we were looking for breakfast at 12pm on a business day for Canadians.  My friend was a little ticked that we had to request syrup and  was brought some hot syrup and then a packet of syrup.    True to the reviews, the turn off was the service.  Our waitress was horrible.  She was not attentive and we had to track her down to get water, hot syrup, etc.  It is a small spot and it wasnt that packed.  I knew we were in trouble when I asked for her sugestion on meal and all she could say was everything is good.  Not helpful.    They need better wait staff.  All else good for what we need it for."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast. Friendly staff. Great waitress! Very reasonable prices. I was staying just down the street in the Le Germaine Hotel. I ate there two mornings. The first time I got eggs (3) and bacon ($5.50 before 9 am!). I ordered my eggs over medium. It is rare to get eggs over medium that are cooked correctly but these were. On the second morning I got eggs, bacon, sausage, and ham--skipped the potatoes but added a pancake (no wonder I'm so fat, huh? :))--again the eggs over medium were perfect. The pancake was also excellent, so fluffy and light (not lite in a calorie kind of way). I can't say enough about the waitress--so friendly and attentive, though she was tending to quite a few tables. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Cheerful waitress (name is Saray, Sarah I guess), elegant service, afordable price. I honestly liked this place."}
{"text":"Arranged a celebration lunch for colleagues at the office, for approx 20 people and the staff at Evviva were very accomodating. The host and servers were very friendly, fast and attentive. The feedback from everyone about the food was that it was great! The food came out at the right temperature and was tasty and delicious. The prices are very reasonable. The restaurant is modern, clean and welcoming. We will definitely return!  Update June 2017 - I have to downgrade this rating, as we had made reservations for a large group for lunch, and when we arrived, our tables had been given away to another group, so disappointing, and management not concerned. We ended up,going next door to the Irish Pub and treated like royalty! I don't think I will,go back to Evviva after what happened."}
{"text":"Our family of five came here for a quick brunch en route to the train station. The friendly servers made sure we got our food quickly and even offered us coffee to go. The home fries were crispy and delicious. Kids' breakfasts were a great value."}
{"text":"So we arrived to Evviva and were seated right away on a labour day Monday long weekend. The venue looks ok and the menu looked good. Everyone ordered and as we were waiting we noticed a lot of flies landing all around us. This is where it became more than tolerable as we ended up spending most of the time swatting flies as they were landing on our food and drinks and our face etc... this was the most annoying part of our visit as the food was actually not bad but the continued experience of swatting flies became annoying and distracting from holding a decent conversation. It is went just one fly but rather more than 20-30 which makes me wonder about the overall cleanliness of the venue. One of the flies actually landed on my friend's mouth/ lips.  Overall I would recommend the food but not for the comfort or sitting with the fly problem they have here."}
{"text":"Good place for an all day breakfast.  Ambiance is nice, should be good for groups. Nice scenery, I recommend sitting by the windows for a great view. Food is good (not great), but good."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients... We had the Mediterranean Wrap and the Gyro Wrap with yam fries. Both very tasty and reasonably priced for the portions."}
{"text":"Good place to start a day.   Chicken & Waffle was awesome."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here and the food was fantastic. I highly recommend the chicken and waffles and the home fries.   Service was nice and hospitable. The only complaint would be the wait time of food. Almost an hour wait."}
{"text":"One thing going for this place is location. Food is very standard and nothing too special. Doesn't compare to the true quality brunch spots in downtown. There are plenty of great breakfast places if you're willing to walk a bit."}
{"text":"I stayed in the delta hotel close by and decided to go to this place. I was very pleased with the service, and food. It was a little pricey ,but overall good food. I would definitely go here again."}
{"text":"Their home fries are to die for. The food was fresh and very tasty. The service was quick and nice. Would come here again."}
{"text":"This place is great. The service can be slow at times but the food is on point and the vibe is relaxed."}
{"text":"We yelped for a good place that the locals love to dine at.  Sure enough, there was a line in the chilly morning air, around 10:00 a.m.  They had outside dining for those who could handle it, but we needed to wait for an indoor table.  My husband ate the smoked meat sandwich which we kept hearing about on our last visit to Montreal.  We are not sure if it is the same in Toronto, but for you Americans out there, it tasted like a pastrami sandwich, only a little drier because it is smoked, but still delicious.  I had the gyro wrap, which I really wasn't expecting to be good, but I was just having a craving for a gyro.  To my surprise it was quite good, something that I'd order again.    But, the next time that I get a chance to visit Evviva again, I will need to try their chicken and waffles.  My eyes kept telling me to order one to go.  It was screaming \"comfort food\" and I think it is one of their specialities.  I think everyone will be able to find something that they like on the menu.  (The line didn't take too long to move and it was probably extra busy because it was Canada Day and people were probably getting a bite to eat before heading to the nearby Redpath Waterfront Festival to see the giant rubber duckie.)"}
{"text":"Great breakfast! I had the Florentine Eggs Benedict, with baby spinach. Nice! And healthy. Staff is really kind too. Big smiles! The only bad: I like techno, EDM and house music. They play some rippoff here.... But that stuff they play is sooooooo commercial! Terrible! So put on your headphones while eating here ;-)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here before heading over to the CN tower in the morning. I had the traditional eggs benedict and the maple latte and my boyfriend had the evviva breakfast sandwich and a hot chocolate. My eggs benedict was fairly cold and the maple latte surprisingly didn't taste like syrup at all IMO (I was kind of looking forward to it, since it was so unique to me). My boyfriend likes the breakfast sandwich and the hot chocolate was just okay. The home fries were nice and crispy!  Service was pretty poor - never had our water glasses filled. When my boyfriend asked to have his filled, the waitress didn't even fill mine! We were also never asked about how our meal was.  Make for an alright breakfast if your are close to the CN tower."}
{"text":"First visit. Ordered the Chicken and Waffles. The waffle was a waffle and the chicken had decent flavour but was dry."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the BEST breakfasts I had in Toronto. The restaurant was within walking distance of the hotel. It is very trendy and upscale for an all day breakfast serving eatery. When we walked up, the patio area was filled with patrons. As a result, we had to dine on the inside of the restaurant. The decor was modern and sleek with a mixture of neutral tones. There were flat screens on the walls and the restaurant was open and airy.   There were so many wonderful choices on the menu. I decided to try they're maple waffles. My God!!!! The waffle was already infused with maple, covered with whipped cream, strawberries, blueberries and bananas. The waffle had a unique flavor that kept me wanting more until it was all gone. I also ordered the Evviva Special Omelette. It consisted of three eggs, spinach, tomatoes, mushrooms, onions, green and red peppers served with herb seasoned potatoes. I was in food heaven this morning. The omelette was perfect and the potatoes were divine. I was a complete glutton and will be drinking water for the rest of the day.   Not only was the food great, but the service was great as well! If you're ever in the neighborhood, this restaurant is a definite must try. You will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"This place is getting 3 stars because of the portion and quality of food, environment and price in mid range restaurant category.   Convenience: I was looking for a lunch place in downtown and that was my last minute pick. You never need to book a reservation here.   Food: I would say food is average but the portion of food definitely make it worth the pennies. Btw, I only ordered fish and salad, not breakfast, as I don't believe the breakfast can meet my standards like Good Fork.   Price: 20 bucks for lunch, not bad at all.   Environment: big place so you can invite more people. Spacious and airy. I enjoy the dining table conversations in a quiet place like this."}
{"text":"We went here for brunch one weekend. It was busy, but we only had to wait about 20 minutes. The eggs Benedict was just average, but the potatoes were good. Service was quick and it's probably one of the better options in the immediate area."}
{"text":"We came here around 1:30 PM on a Sunday afternoon after reading reviews on Yelp, we wanted to try it out. We must have caught the tail-end of the busy time as we were seated quickly and most people were halfway/ finishing up their food. The service was definitely very pleasant and quick.   They have their all day breakfast option mixed in with some sandwiches and entrees. Don't be fooled by their website! The online menu there isn't fully representative of what's actually on the menu. I can definitely appreciate the fact that there were vegetarian options as well as non-egg breakfast options as well.   I ordered the Florentine Spinach Eggs Benny with home fries ($13) with coffee ($3, bottomless). The home fries were deliciously crispy and just had enough seasoning. Eggs Benny were perfectly cooked - honestly I'd say that it's cooked a little more than what I'm used to so the yolk didn't run everywhere. Coffee though was just okay. I found it a little sour even though it was still hot when the waitress poured it. I believe it was Lavazza branded coffee.   It is more expensive than other brunch places but I think with the quality of food and service, it's definitely worth coming back."}
{"text":"An Evviva Omelet with a side order of potatoes and rye bread ... can't really mess that up which they did not. We enjoyed our breakfast but the coffee was underwhelming. With so many coffee locations around Toronto, everyone has to up their coffee game!"}
{"text":"Ate brunch/lunch on a hot Saturday early afternoon. There were lots of tables available when we arrived which was surprising given its near proximity to several condos downtown. We ordered the eggs benedict and the Philly Cheeesteak sandwich. Also ordered the Evviva breakfast sandwich for take out.    The eggs benedict was mediocre with nothing serious to rave about. The shredded cheddar cheese in my Philly Cheesesteak was not melted and the sandwich was completely different from the picture in the menu. If a restaurant decides to use pictures in their menu, it should be as realistic as possible, not from an external online source.  In regards to the Evviva breakfast sandwich, it was just ok. The bun was a little dry for our liking and did not complement the contents of the sandwich very well.  We all agreed that the best part of the meal were the home fries.  No complaints about service however.  PS - No liquor license on the patio yet."}
{"text":"Tasty mimosas and coffee, pretty basic breakfast but really good home fries!"}
{"text":"Always come here for brunch. On the weekends, the lineup to be seated is pretty long but don't be fooled, it goes by fairly quick. The food is great. I love getting their omelettes. The orange juice is amazing!!"}
{"text":"My friends and I were in Toronto over the weekend and ended up staying in a condo right above Evviva.  When we arrived, we had our luggage with us and that did not seem to impress the waitress.  She warmed up to us though, and turned out to be awesome! Great service.  The food is also unreal, AND THE ORANGE JUICE - it's the best!!! Freshly squeezed on the spot!  We ended up going back the next day because we all liked it so much.  Our service the second day was not as good. There was one waitress who was very rude to the other staff, in the middle of the restaurant, on more than one occasion (in the 45-60 minutes we spent there).  All in all, the food is awesome, the menu is great, the OJ is the best! I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I went on a Saturday and this place was A LOT busier than what I had imagined. Only 26 reviews on Yelp, but our group of 4 people waited around 45 minutes for a table. It is close to Rogers Centre so there are a few Blue Jays fans grabbing a bite to eat before/after a game.  Their menu contain both breakfast and lunch items. There are a number of bacon/ham/egg/sausage combos available that are accompanied by \"three fresh-farm eggs any style, savoury herbed home fries and your choice of white, rye, multigrain or gluten free bread.\" Ordered the ham & egg one, only for $8.50. The winner indeed was the home fries, which were more like hashbrowns, which were well seasoned and very crispy (double fried?). Scrambled eggs were smooth. Bread nicely toasted and ham nicely seared.   Friends ordered the benedicts which looked delicious. Service was great as was food presentation. Not very accessible by public transit but you may be up for a walk after a filling meal."}
{"text":"Eh, this place is average. Just average. You can get average pancakes or average waffles. You can get almost anything for breakfast/ brunch on an average level. The pancakes came out with \"pancake syrup\" in plastic packages. But isn't this the Maple Syrup capital of the World? Kind of a let down... I had the salmon eggs Benedict and it did not meet my expectations which were average. The salmon tasted extremely fishy, not good at all. My maple latte tasted like a latte. I don't know where the maple was... maybe it had a drop of \"pancake syrup\" in there.   The service was really nice though! And we enjoyed sitting outside."}
{"text":"I love Evviva in Vaughan one of my favourites.  So I was so exited to try it downtown - food was the same. Love it.  I was disappointed in service.  A server from Vaughan was there and us being regulars so excited to see a familiar face. She was rude and unkind and not friendly.   We chalked it up to her having a bad day.  She was much friendlier with the gentleman guests.  We asked to sit outside and was told she had no time to clean it or set a table for us as they only had 3 servers. Within 10 mins there was a total of 9 who stood around and did nothing.  We asked again told No. Then 4 minutes later opened patio.   A homeless person came in asking for water. One server kind enough to provide the water another server reprimanded her for that. The man just wanted water.  Even if it's a habit who cares. We need to be humans and take care of each-other !! It's water it cost nothing !!!!!!!  I just think businesses and people have a loyalty to each-other it's the right thing to do !"}
{"text":"Mediocre brunch restaurant.   I ordered the Chicken and waffle with a side of blueberry pancakes. They weren't bad, but I haven't better chicken and waffles. The service was fine too, nothing to complain about. There was a wait time, but it's fairly close to the CN tower and harborfront, so you can kill off 30mins to an hour fairly easily in summer time.   Overall, I will be back for brunch, since it is in a convenient location for me. Although the bill was pricey (came to about $20), it's a well kept restaurant in the hear of downtown - so I guess you pay a premium for that."}
{"text":"breakfast was good, the service was good but the only thing is the price was high. my server ask me if i wanted fresh squeezed juice i said \"yes\" as i didnt know it was 6$ for a glasse of juice but juice was good. bill was 45$ for 2 people breakfast as its high.   But i would go back to try other things on the menu but not the fresh squeezed juice! lol"}
{"text":"Great place to people watch before heading to an event at Rogers Centre.    The food was pretty good, 4/5.  We had the spinach omelette & pancakes (with maple syrup).  Both were delicious and highly recommended.  Ambiance was definitely above average 4.5/5  Service was okay, 3/5.  e.g. The server didn't bring out the full order and all the substitutes we had requested.  The waitress had to intervene & get correct the order (maple syrup instead of pancake syrup, wheat bread wasn't brought out initially).    Overall I gave it a 4/5."}
{"text":"Went here for a Sunday morning brunch. Not too crowded. The decor is nice, the wait staff are friendly but the food is average. Nothing special and no attempt to create any unique/differentiated cuisine."}
{"text":"I have been here bunch of times and it has always impressed. Being vegetarian, there are very few places that serve breakfast items but this place has good options. The house hash browns are amazing. I like the fact that it opens at 7:00am everyday..!"}
{"text":"I think this is my new brunch go to place! There were so many options of food and the brunch is conveniently served all day! The prices are also affordable and the quality of the food is worth it. The service was friendly and the interior of the restaurant was modern and clean. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who loves their salmon benedicts ;)"}
{"text":"This place was recommended by our airbnb person as I was on vacation. I was seated very fast; however, no waitress had come over to take my drink order. I had to ask a passing by waitress. After I finally had my order taken, it took a while for my food to arrive. I had ordered the Atlantic smoked salmon eggs benedict, and my first impression was that the plates were huge. Half of the plate was taken up by home fries and the eggs Benedict was cold. The real good thing about the dish I ordered was the smoked salmon. I wouldn't recommend coming here for breakfast."}
{"text":"This is the perfect spot for a breakfast with friends. If you are planning to come here on a weekend, be sure to arrive before 11 am or you could be waiting up to an hour for a table.  The service here is attentive and kind. They are always ready with a fresh pot of coffee to top up your cup.  On this trip I ordered the eggs and sausage. The best thing on my plate were the hash browns, they were perfectly crispy and seasoned. My boyfriend ordered his usual, the eggs benny; they always seem to cook the eggs perfectly. I also should mention that the portions are huge.   At $45 for 2 breakfasts and 2 coffees, this place costs a pretty penny. It's not your every weekend breakfast joint, but is great for a treat once in a while!"}
{"text":"We liked Evivva so much, we ate there twice during our week long stay in Toronto. Granted, it's not hard to impress my fiance with breakfast food, but everything about our experiences there was delightful.  The first time we went, we both had eggs benedict; I went for the traditional version while my fiance tried the Florentine. The eggs were perfectly poached and the hollandaise was so rich and creamy! Both came with a generous portion of home fries as well, and they had just the right amount of crispiness. He had a maple latte on both visits, and he was a little disappointed it how light the maple flavor was the first time until he realized it all settled at the bottom of the cup.  On our second visit, my fiance made sure to stir his maple latte. I ordered the berry waffle, which comes with fresh berries, strawberry coulis, powdered sugar, and a hefty scoop of vanilla ice cream. My fiance got the maple waffle, which includes bananas and swaps out the ice cream for whipped cream and syrup. They were fluffy and slightly sweet with a bit of a nutty flavor that we loved.  None of our food was greasy. It may seem odd to bring that up, but we've been to a ton of breakfast places, and it's apparently tough to strike the balance between \"flavorful\" and \"coated in lard.\"  The atmosphere is also beautiful. We were seated at a two top both times, but unlike most restaurants in Toronto, these two tops were arranged so that there was a bit more space between them. The restaurant has a clean, modern look, and the large windows let in plenty of light. Oh, and as weird as this sounds, I was ecstatic about the wash rooms! They're so clean and there are no gaps in the stall doors, so you have total privacy.  While some reviews have mentioned terrible service, we had great service. On our first visit, the host was new and wasn't sure where he was supposed to seat us, so rather than hem and haw, he fetched someone else for help. On our second visit, we had a $42 tab, meant to give the waitress $50, and told her to keep the change. We accidentally gave her $70, but instead of keeping the money, she immediately came back to the table. The staff was always polite, the food came out relatively quickly, and while the espresso beverages were pricey, paying $14 for a large and delicious entree more than made up for that."}
{"text":"First time i.went was really great and second time their Smoke meat sandwich presentation was weak.   The breakfast below.was really great though"}
{"text":"I usually never write reviews but this place was so good. We were here for 5 days and we ate breakfast here every. Single. Day. So good o my god 10/10 great potatos , keep up the good work"}
{"text":"A fantastic place for take breakfast! Good and tasty food. All was very good. Rapid and excellent service. Recommended! I will return."}
{"text":"Stick to the breakfast items. Ordered the chicken pesto sandwich and the meat was almost jerky style. The breakfast that my colleague ordered looked much better though."}
{"text":"Evviva is definitely one of the most reasonably priced brunch places in this area - hence why it gets so busy on weekends. My friend and I arrived a little after 12pm on a Sunday for brunch and had to wait a little before we were seated.  The menu has tons of options for decent prices. It took me a while to choose something because everything sounded so good. I decided to go with the smoked salmon eggs benedict, which wasn't the best I've had, but still pretty good. The server didn't ask how I wanted my eggs poached, so I got the default of soft poached eggs, while I generally prefer them medium poached. The home fries were really good - well-seasoned and crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.   My friend got the steak and eggs, which was surprisingly only around $15 or so, when a dish like this generally costs $20 at other places. It came with 3 eggs, toast, and a good sized steak. She asked for it medium rare, and it was cooked just as she asked.   The food came pretty quickly and the service was quite attentive. They also didn't rush us or kick us out even though we stayed a bit longer to chat after finishing our food.   I would definitely recommend this place for a yummy and affordable hangover brunch! I'm excited to come back and try their other options on their massive menu."}
{"text":"I'm told this is a relatively new breakfast & lunch restaurant in Toronto, so my coworker and I decided to give them a try for our business breakfast. Located within an easy walk of Union Station, it was easy to find.  They offer a nicely varied menu featuring traditional bacon & egg combos, omelettes, pancakes and the like. I decided on the bacon, sausage, ham and eggs and ordered mine with a side of French toast. Like the day before, my palate was seeking both sweet and savory, and I certainly was happy to oblige. I didn't care for the sausage much, as it was link sausage and a tad greasy for my taste. The bacon and ham were very good, the hash brown potatoes were nicely seasoned and crispy, and the French toast with syrup offset the savory items very nicely.  As terrific as the food was, I was surprised that they were not very busy at 8:00 on a Thursday morning. My coworker, a downtown Toronto resident, speculated that it may be because they are not in the PATH, although access is very close by.  Nonetheless, The breakfast was outstanding, the coffee black and hot, and the service was stellar. I'd do this again in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Good food, nice atmosphere, very busy on a Friday and Tuesday morning (ate there twice). The service was OK... our server was friendly but very slow and it was hard for her to keep up (no coffee refills, forgot sweetener and waters) because it was so busy. She seemed to be the only one working there? The location was great, near to hotels and activities and the price was reasonable for the area. Would definitely go there again - just not if I was in a hurry!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service! We got tons of really good food affordable with eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes, toast, ham, and pancakes! It is also right next to the CN tower!"}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this place but it was average at best.  We waited at least 10 minutes for our coffees. Server didn't seem concerned.   Food was extremely slow.  Nice patio and great location especially before a Jays game but the service really turned me off.  Won't go back."}
{"text":"Evviva offers a nice ambience and customer service throughout the meal. Upon arrival I was given a choice of seating where ever I liked. The menu offers an array of different breakfast and lunch options.   I settled for the eggs benny florentine with a really good Illy coffee. I was asked if I liked my eggs runny or hard and after requesting runny eggs they came a little over cooked. Worst off is I wouldn't have even noticed if I wasn't even asked. They were very skimpy with the hollandaise sauce which made the English muffin a little dry and the spinach was mediocre at best. As for the hash browns, I had only read good things about them and they were pretty good!  Overall I'd rate the experience as nice and the food satisfactory. Wouldn't be my first choice to go back although not a bad place overall."}
{"text":"Clean and friendly wait staff, but I would not recommend the Chicken and waffles. Both waffle and chicken were dry and tough. Not enough maple syrup served to help this one out. Home fries and breakfast sandwich were pretty good. Plentiful portions."}
{"text":"Food was great. We wanted to come to this place for breakfast however decided that the lunch sounded better. I had a spicy beef sandwich and fries that was great. Husband had a burger and asked how it was cooked, the waitress replied shortly they are only made one way.   Huge downfall was the service. Ordered two cokes and waited until after our food was delivered for them. Prior to this we had water which ours set empty for a while. Our waitress, Rachel, was rude and short, not friendly at all. She seemed to busy with doing chores around the restaurant and talking to coworkers to care. The manager also just stands by the Cafe bar and stares."}
{"text":"I had reservations for the edgewalk at the CN Tower and wanted to get breakfast and kill some time nearby beforehand.  It was my first time in Toronto and I was surprised to see that the streets were empty and most of the restaurants were closed for breakfast on a weekday.  I was about to give up on my quest for an open breakfast spot and head back over to Tim Horton's, when I noticed a sign in the street off in the distance.  That sign advertised Evviva's being open and I was glad I spotted it!  The restaurant was clean, spacious and well-decorated.  My server was patient and friendly.    The food was plentiful - maybe too plentiful since I had to save half for lunch.  I would have probably preferred smaller portions at lower prices than the huge portions received at higher prices but all in all, I felt that it was a good value for all that I received.    I was surprised to see that another reviewer mentioned the food being too salty since mine tasted like the chef forgot the salt.  I didn't expect the lack of flavor/salt so it led to a bad first impression but that was easily fixed with me salting my own food.  Once salted, I realized that the lack of salt is a good thing since it allowed people to control their sodium intake and I suddenly wished more restaurants allowed for that.  My toast, on the other hand, was drenched in butter.  I don't usually butter my toast and wished I knew that this restaurant does that (most American restaurants don't and instead, serves the butter on the side).  The sausage was really yummy - crisp on the outside and moist on the inside.  I had some sort of iced coffee which was good but not memorable.  Overall, the food was average with only the sausage being memorable. I would drop in just for the sausage the next time I'm in town.  I'm glad I found this place.  Next time, I'll bring a friend and share a breakfast plate with an extra order of sausage rather than try to tackle a plate on my own."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our breakfast at Evviva. We got there around 11 and walked right to our table, but a wait definitely started to accumulate after we were seated. Our waitress Danielle was wonderful. I got the Nutella Waffle which came with strawberries and ice cream (I opted out of the ice cream) and a side of home fries which were both great. The mimosas are made with fresh-squeezed orange juice and are so good. My friend enjoyed the pancakes and bacon. The prices are average and I definitely recommend this spot."}
{"text":"Very nice place with big-portion tasty brunch. Friendly staff and good view (if you come early enough to get a seat by window). I have been visiting here almost every weekend lol and hardly get tired of it"}
{"text":"Today I ordered a burger combo with the chicken waffle.  I took a bite of my burger and a HUGE BLACK HAIR was in the meat. I took it apart to really take a look at this and it was a full black hair. I was and am so disgusted.  It wasn't on the tomato it was cooked in the burger meat   Ew Didn't even eat the waffle chicken they were very uncooked and soggy.  Very disgusting"}
{"text":"Evviva Restaurant is a popular American restaurant that serves breakfast during the week and brunch on the weekend. Before leaving Toronto, we decided to stop by Evviva Restaurant.   For drinks, they offer bottled smoothies and juices (e.g., Minute Maid, Simply) as well as alcoholic beverages (e.g., Cesar, Mimosa).  For breakfast, we ordered a Smart Heart Breakfast, Ham, Maple Waffle, Hot Buttermilk Pancakes, and HomeFries.   My parents shared the Smart Heart Breakfast, which consisted of three eggs (they requested all white), choice of protein (they requested the grilled chicken breast), and choice of among Greek, Caesar, Diva, or fruit salad (they requested fruit salad). The fruit salad consisted of fresh pieces of honeydew, cantaloupe, strawberry, and pineapple. Despite my pork allergy, I had to try the ham, which was pan fried and quite tasty.  I ordered the Maple Waffle because I love Belgian waffles, it was topped with fresh fruit (e.g., strawberries, blueberries, bananas) and Canadian Maple Syrup. It was also well described in writing and presented in pictures online. However, my first bite was salty and sour and I knew something was wrong. Our server was very apologetic and let me get something else from menu. I decided to get the Traditional Eggs Benedict, which consisted of a toasted English muffin topped with ham and poached egg and served with home fries. I liked how the home fries were crispy and seasoned with salt and pepper and fresh herbs.  My brother ordered Hot Buttermilk Pancakes. The regular portion came with two which the larger portion came with three pancakes. The pancakes were dusted with confectioner sugar and served with a fruit salad."}
{"text":"Terrible breakfast. \"Home fries\" tasted like they went from the freezer into the deep fryer. \"House Hollandaise\" was bland, coffee tasted of mold. Blick!  Service was great though, nice young women.   Just a handful of patrons at 8am in the most populated part of the city. I guess I found out why."}
{"text":"This is a pretty typical place for Breakfast and lunch, there was nothing fantastic about it and nothing horrible either. I got a Cesar which was not made well. If you need breakfast and are in the area go for it, but dont make a special trip out to eat here. Best thing to eat are the home fries."}
{"text":"Remarkably average.  Average food, average (for downtown) price point,  average service.  The waitress was really talkative with one of the customers, that was slightly annoying.  All around not good but not bad either."}
{"text":"I had breakfast at this restaurant today based on location & the reviews from yelp. The food was very good, it was great value for the money spent. I really liked the coffee & highly recommend this place for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Eh...only thing that was good here was the bloody mary.   My friends and I came here for brunch on a Saturday because all the other spot had 45+ wait and we were all starving. We waited about 30 minutes to get seated which was not that bad. When we got there, there were another group of people that was waiting near the hostess station. After we put our name down, the hostess told us to wait outside or between the doors for \"customers\" Well...I guess we aren't customers yet I guess...after waiting for a while, we finally got sat. The server was nice and took our orders right away. Everyone all ordered a different platter except one of my friend and I each ordered chicken and waffles. When the food came out, the food look delicious...until...we tried to cut the chicken and....the chicken was not cutting. I REPEAT. WE COULD NOT CUT THE CHICKEN BECAUSE IT WAS SO DRY. I NEVER EVER SAW A CHICKEN THAT WAS SO DRY IN MY LIFE. We kept trying to cut the chicken and it wouldn't budge. I finally got a little piece off and I almost choked on that piece. I kept drinking water and the chicken was not going down.   Everyone else's food was..just OKAY. nothing special about this place at all. But if you planning to dine here, DO NOT, I REPEAT. DO NOT ORDER THE CHICKEN AND WAFFLES AND DO NOT STAND BY THE HOSTESS STATION. Leave some room for \"customers\""}
{"text":"Finally, a heaven-sent! Being a brunch lover, I've never been a huge fan of the Harbourfront area, because there was never a decent place for brunch. And recently, this happened - and I couldn't be a bigger fan of the Harbourfront area!  Let me start with the service - having been here multiple times already, I can honestly say every single time the service is fantastic. Very friendly servers with amazingly short wait time. Coffee cups are never left emptied which is a +++ . A personal experience with how amazing the service is: I forgot to switch my side of potatoes to sweet potatoes - but because my food was ready, the server gave me a cup of spicy aioli to go with my potatoes.   Now, on to the food. I'm the kind of person who, once I've tried something I like, I'm hooked! Here's my go to:  Eggs benedict with smoked salmon - delicious! Fresh smoked salmon with perfectly poached eggs, covered with creamy hollandaise. I also had the challah French toast, topped with cinnamon powder. Perfection!   All in all, I would certainly reco this place to anyone in the area. Great way to start off your weekend morning!"}
{"text":"We LOVE this place! it's always busy on the weekends around brunch, but we usually stop by for a weekday lunch or breakfast.   Heads up: Some servers are snobby and rude, but the others make up for it.   Food; Absolutely delicious. Have had the Evviva Breakfast sandwich, Eggs Benedict (a few different varieties), Eggs, bacon, and homefries, and Chicken and Waffle. Their homefries are to die for, and the Chicken and Waffle is AMAZING!  Drinks: FRESH SQUEEZED OJ! Their lattes are to die for! The Maple Latte and Cafe Mocha are favourites.   Price: Really affordable for the quality of food.   Location: Right near the CN tower and Harbourfront Centre. Located super close to our condo building.   I love Evviva and plan on returning regularly."}
{"text":"Love the food and I've always had great service. It gets really busy on the weekends, so if you're starving, you'll probably have to wait a bit. Though line ups tend to go fast. The coffee is really good, so I love that it's bottomless. I've only ever had the breakfast food, can't speak for the rest. It's on the pricier side for brunch, I mean if I'm comparing it to Frans, but delicious!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this restaurant.  It was one of the few places close to the Airbnb I was staying at on York street.   I think it was just a bad day.  I wanted the chicken maple waffle so I asked the waitress if the chicken was peppery. She said no.  When the plate arrived, the chicken had a lot of pepper on it (which is ok for most people but it makes me cough) so I asked to just change the chicken for fruit instead.   The fruit maple waffle looked really good and my first few bites were satisfying... Until I pulled a piece of strawberry with a 2 cm long hair in it. I just couldn't bring myself to continue.   So the waitress just wrote off my bill but sadly, I left hungry..."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. First impression: decor was eclectic, staff was friendly. I had the crown burger with home fries. Huge portions. I removed a star from my rating because the burger patty was a bit weird - a lot of flour was mixed into the patty, so the consistency resembled mush. Otherwise, solid breakfast/lunch spot."}
{"text":"We tried the chicken and waffles and the berry waffles and they were great! I'm not a big waffle person but these waffles were soft and buttery and flavorful. Their coffee was good too and the staff was friendly. When we arrived a line was starting to form so we assumed it was definitely the place to be for breakfast. The chicken was flavorful with it being crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside. Definitely would come back."}
{"text":"Okay so I'm really late with my review. My boyfriend and i visited Toronto for his birthday weekend back in Nov 2016. We came to eat here twice!! I absolutely loveeee this place. It was right across the street from my hotel (Delta hotel by Toronto) and customer service was great! First time I had eggs benny and he had a breakfast sandwich. We both lovedddd the hash browns because it was made from an angel above whoever that was. The next time we came we both had chicken and waffles. I highly freaking recommend because the food is great and CHEAP!"}
{"text":"Ordered the evviva breakfast sandwich and french toast. The food was decent and the service was good. It was a very spacious place with nice ambience"}
{"text":"At the suggestion of our hotel concierge, we stopped in on our way to the harbor ferry terminal. There was no wait we were greeted nicely and seated quickly. Our waitress came over to go drink orders then gave us time to look over the menu. The atmosphere was calm but busy. We both ordered breakfast; husband had pancakes while I had French toast. We were not disappointed with this breakfast suggestion."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place. Home fries were very good. Close to Union Station, the ACC and the Rogers Centre."}
{"text":"3.5 stars for Evviva, a cute little brunch spot a stone's throw from the Roger's Center.    2 Things I liked - I ordered the french toast, which I believe was made with challah bread, and it was SO good.  Perfectly golden brown, dusted with icing sugar, with real maple syrup, aka \"the good stuff\", on the side.  There was nothing particularly fancy about this dish but it was delicious and was exactly what I wanted.  My dining companion had toast, eggs, bacon and home fries and said the home fries were some of the best she's had.  We love a good breakfast and both of us left completely satisfied.  The location!  I ate here in March, too cold for the patio, but I can imagine that in the summer, it'd be a beautiful spot to eat outdoors.  A good view of the CN tower, and it was on Lower Simcoe, which was fairly quiet for such a central location.  1 Thing I didn't - Nothing!  I have no complaints about Evviva.  If you're looking for new twists on old favourites, this isn't the place for you, but if you're looking for a good stack of classic pancakes or eggs and bacon, this is your spot."}
{"text":"TLDR: A new breakfast joint with the possibility of being a \"go-to\" for harbourfront, if they work through some seating and service issues.  My boyfriend and I have been anxiously awaiting the all day breakfast place opening right outside our apartment. So when we saw the \"grand opening\" signs we were excited to try Evviva immediately!  Sunday morning of their first weekend open, and it was busy! We only had to wait about ten minutes to be seated. Unfortunately, they had squished tables and seats so close together to allow for as many guests in the space as possible. This was an issue as I had to really squeeze between two tables to get to a booth. I was honestly concerned that I was going to bump my neighbour's food with my bum. It was THAT close!  We sat and waited for about 20 minutes for a server to first acknowledge us. And this only happened because we waved someone down. The server apologized for having missed us and we ordered our food and drinks at the same time.   Our food came rather promptly, but unfortunately with a mistake on my plate. They immediately fixed it and we got to finally eat. I enjoyed my breakfast sandwich, even though it looked nothing like the image in the menu. My boyfriend found his bacon, eggs, and sausage rather mediocre.   We did find that the prices were quite justifiable.  I have a feeling our experience was mostly related to a grand opening and staff being new,   We will be returning as many of the menu items sound enticing and I'm hopeful that this will become our \"go-to\" breakfast joint!  -Ashley Marie"}
{"text":"Wow fantastic place for breakfast !!! Close to Rogers center and Ripley aquarium !!! Parking across the street!!! Nice customer service !!! Prices are good !!! They accept master card visa and American Express !!!! Coffee is excellent !!!! Chicken and waffles is ok !!!! Elviva special breakfast was yummy yummy !!! Free coffee refill !!!!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere of the restaurant was tranquil and clean so it is nice to have a conversation here.  Their service was very attentive too (Follow up occasionally and kindly).  The food tastes like other good restaurants that serve this dish so nothing particular to comment on the taste.  Could come here for a brunch every month or so"}
{"text":"As an avid brunch fan, I'm always on the search for great brunch places in the area, and Evviva does not disappoint.  I ordered the traditional eggs benedict, which came with two eggs, and home fries on the side.  The eggs were perfectly cooked; I prefer my eggs runny and they were perfect.  The mimosas are made with very fresh orange juice and it tastes delicious.  Although the wait can be from 10-15 minutes during the brunch/lunch rush, it is absolutely worth it.  The wait staff are nice and welcoming and made the experience so much better.  The atmosphere is light and fun as well.  I highly recommend going here for brunch."}
{"text":"If I could give it a 3.5, I would. The service was exceptional. Everything you want in a dining experience. The food was okay. I had the chicken and waffles. The chicken was dryad flavorless, the waffle was tough to cut through. The syrup helped, but not by much. They should use dark meat chicken and a lighter waffle recipe. They should also add fresh chopped chives or another herb to brighten it up."}
{"text":"I couldn't rate this place better than average even if I fried!   I moved to this area recently and being a huge brunch person, I was on the lookout for a new spot but I was a little disappointed. Maybe cause I was looking for a place to become a regular, I may have been a little harsh. The plate may seem large and the quantity a lot, but I can assure you, that you won't be getting your money's worth here. If you love home fries, you'll probably enjoy this place cause they will fill your plate with em! The actual brunt of the meal is served in scarce quantities.   I ordered the Atlantic Salmon Eggs Benedict which was around $14 + tax and definitely not worth what I paid for it. The muffin toast it was served on was burnt to a crisp, and I almost broke through my plate trying to cut through it. The eggs were poached fairly well but the whites were just all over the place.  I visited this place with my parents who ordered the Spanish omelette. They were hoping to get a healthier alternative with fewer yolks and more whites but we were told that this wasn't possible as the eggs were mixed in the morning. That said, they still enjoyed the omelette! (Maybe I should try that next time)  The only saving grace for this restaurant was our server who was extremely sweet. She made sure to check in to make sure our food was ok, went back to check if any dietary restrictions could be accommodated, and made sure we got our food as soon as it was made (the restaurant was fairly packed, we had to wait 10 minutes for our table)"}
{"text":"The food was ok. Nothing crazy. The coffee cup had lipstick on it, but that can happen anywhere. They don't have any milk alternatives for us coffee drinkers though."}
{"text":"Food is really good and super fresh. Aside from this.. Playing Pandora is a huge risk at a restaurant . Songs with the N word and F bomb is unacceptable . I told them.. It just wasn't a priority. Got kids??? Don't bring them here. Offended by racial slurs?? Don't come here."}
{"text":"Such a good breakfast place! They have all day breakfast and everything is so amazing. Mimosas are great and the vanilla iced coffee was good as well. I ordered the buttermilk pancakes which were the best pancakes I've ever had! Definitely get a side of bacon with your meal as well. We also had an waitress named Danielle who is amazing at her job. Definitely stop by here if you want a moderate-priced delicious breakfast!"}
{"text":"We went to Evviva restaurant for a team lunch. There were around 16 of us. Luckily, we made reservations and were quickly seated. Evviva restaurant is beautifully decorated brightly lit restaurant. The waitress was great and very friendly even though there were 16 of us.  I ordered the crown burger with fries for my lunch. I thought that the burger was okay, but it tasted like meatloaf and not like a hamburger patty. Everybody else enjoyed their food.  I would recommend Evviva for breakfast or lunch. The service was excellent and everybody else like their food."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere!  Very decent price, high quality ingredients .  I personally love breakfast and they serve it all day.  and very generous portion.  I had a smoked salmon bagel that came with a side salad.  The salmon portion was thick and tasty, and the creme cheese made it even better.  The garden salad was of a good quality mixture of veggies."}
{"text":"Visited Toronto and choose Evviva to have breakfast and kept on returning every morning. Gourmet quality and service nearby the CN Tower. You can select either fruits or potatoes with your selection."}
{"text":"It's a decent enough spot if you're looking for an all-day breakfast option. I've tried their French toast (good), chicken and waffles (don't do it - it's not an authentic experience in Canada) and more recently their spicy burger (very good).  I've gone with colleagues during the work day and we've never had to wait long for our food.  Quick service, good-enough food."}
{"text":"Great staff. Good food. Even the restroom was very nice and clean. Only suggestion would be to close the back door to limit insects."}
{"text":"There is something endearing about a restaurant where the waitstaff is as friendly as one's aunt Jamaima! I went here for brunch on a Sunday was seated within minutes. I ordered freshly squeezed orange juice which came in a large glass ( which was surprising because anything freshly squeezed these days is served in shot glasses) along with eggs and chicken sausage links with home fries (the best in downtown) and toast. I also ordered illy cappuccino on the side. The food was delicious, not greasy, and filling."}
{"text":"Tl;dr version -- this is THE summer must-brunch spot in central Toronto.   When my son and I met in Toronto the first week in July 2016, we had a wonderful set of meals at various restaurants. Of the places we sampled, by far the best brunch spot was Evviva's. We had to wait a few minutes for a table, but the food was great, the servers were as efficient as they could be with the Blue Jays in town and during Pride weekend, and the outdoor seating was ... Okay, the bucket plastic seating was not the best, but really, this was the first weekend they had opened the patio.   Maybe it was the conversation with my son, maybe it was the eavesdropping of the fellow customers who were still waiting to be seated, but this was definitely my favorite breakfast/lunch of the weekend. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Kerry was our server and she was awesome!!! She was very friendly, attentive, and provided great recommendations. I ordered the chicken and waffles which came with sour cream and maple syrup. The chicken was a bit on the dry side but tasted good with the sour cream and syrup. The waffle was SOOOO good. It was light, soft, and flaky. My boyfriend ordered the Montreal smoked meat sandwich with onion rings. The meat was very tender, the bread was soft and the onion rings were amazing! It's too bad they don't open for dinner. We will definitely come back the next time we're in Toronto."}
{"text":"Got the sausage, bacon and ham with eggs. $12 and add $1 for pancakes or French toast.   I decided to try the French toast which was quite eggy but for $1 how can you really complain? Just slather some pb and j on it and it's pretty good.   Massive portions. I'm stuffed. Pretty decent prices, would totally come back here if I were in the area.   Big area with alot of seating. Get the widow seat ;)   Staff are friendly and helpful. Good atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Came to dine in for Breakfast, but since the wait was long we opted out for take out.   Had an omelette, which is served with potatoes (deep fried! Wish they mentioned that) and a toast. They do offer Gluten Free toast at an extra charge or $2.5.   The food was good, nothing special though. It served its purpose though. The waiters were nice and the place looked pretty good too."}
{"text":"The chicken and waffles I ordered was pretty good. The chicken was seasoned well and the waffle was well, a waffle. It was around $15. My server was really attentive and good. People seemed to be enjoying the other breakfast items they had as well."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place just across the street from the Delta Hotel. Large portions and reAsonable price"}
{"text":"Nothing is better than finding an inexpensive, tasty neighborhood breakfast diner. Evviva has awesome menu options. Great location for visitors staying in downtown Toronto. If you have gluten sensitivities, they have the means to still cater to you. The food was excellent. I got there very early after the doors opened at 7, and was seated immediately. I would recommend to anyone that was staying in downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"Phenomenal breakfast spot. Maple waffle with fruit is a must. Great coffee, nice patio location overlooking the CN Tower and friendly service."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst places I have ever been to hands down. Service was dispicable sat for 15 minutes no exaggeration before even getting menus and that's because I asked for them. Then took 10 more minutes to get drinks. Place wasn't extremely busy and someone who looked like a manager spent his time clearing off tables even though there was no wait at the door instead of being observant and noticing that we had not gotten any service yet. Got our food after about an hour of being there and had to wait 5 more minutes to get silverware that she didn't think to bring us before our meals. Food was just like most others said average at best. I can't tell you anything about drinks because I ordered a mimosa and they ran out of champagne.. just horrible on all fronts and I am a pretty easy customer"}
{"text":"Great place, food what decent great location considering there lots of residents in the area, the wait wasn't to long we had steak and eggs and traditional eggs Benny, everything was above average size which is good overall I would go back."}
{"text":"I love their crispy potato tatters and special breakfast ! They also, serve real \" illy coffee \"  beans  I wish their head waitress ( owner ? ) was more nicer to waitresses ! Bad vibes !"}
{"text":"A wholesome experience! It was a lovely day so we sat outside with a view of the CN Tower and the beautiful people of Toronto. The service was good and the wait was average. Considering it was a Sunday brunch hour, I'd say much better than I expected. The best thing about Evviva, its Home-Fries. Do NOT forget to try them. I assure you they are worth the hype. Crispy, perfectly cooked, deliciously seasoned. I would come back just to eat the home fries. Rest of the food was delicious too. We got the chocolate-chip pancakes, salmon and eggs, and a side of eggs. We were content!  Evviva is a perfect start to a tourist's long and eventful day!"}
{"text":"Excellent brunch in Toronto!! The best brunch I've had on my trip, great outdoor seating. Highly recommend this spot in Toronto!"}
{"text":"My co-worker and I came here for lunch because it was close enough to the office to walk, but also far away from the hustle and bustle of Bremner Blvd. The restaurant is pretty big. There was a large work group celebrating some event when we were there, so it can definitely accommodate plenty of people. However, if the group is large enough as was the case that day, you will not all sit together. From what I understand, it's usually not busy.  We sat by the window at a table for two. The menu is fairly large and they have all-day breakfast, which was tempting! I ordered a swiss and mushroom burger. My co-worker ordered the salmon. Overall, I thought the food was decent. It wasn't amazing, but it was filling and the price was reasonable. If I get tired of the same old food courts, then I wouldn't mind coming back here."}
{"text":"I was excited to see a new breakfast / brunch place open up in the area however I found it to be very mediocre. I ordered the eggs Benedict and it was ok but far from the best. The tator tots it comes with were meh. If you're in the area and just looking for a convenient breakfast spot then I'd suggest it but it's nothing to write home about!"}
{"text":"We were visiting from MI and needed a quick bite before going to Niagara Falls. Tried the eggs Benedict with salmon, French toast, pancakes, and spinach omelette... they were average. The best thing was the side of homefries. Service was slow and getting water was a chore. It's a cool spot if you have time to waste and don't feel like looking for more."}
{"text":"Guys,seriously. Wanna ruin your perfect morning time eating here-feel free to) Maybe I'm spoiled by organic natural food but I can't eat meals made out of processed one anymore. Btw, IQ is just around the corner)"}
{"text":"A wonderful breakfast 2 days in a row.  This small restaurant, with great outdoor seating.  The Maple waffle  but the pea meal bacon was disappointing.  The remainder of the meal delicious.  The next day we had pancakes and a Montreal bagel and lox (smoked salmon).  Both had superb fresh fruit as a side. Neither of these were as tasty as the previous days waffle, but better than most.  I would have liked fewer brown spots on the lox."}
{"text":"I can't believe i haven't given Evviva a review yet since I've been here on numerous occasions. I'm a huge breakfast person so I can't function without food before 11. Since it's a short walk from me, it has now become a breakfast place of choice. I usually come on weekend mornings before noon and on the occasional weekday morning so I can only speak for their breakfast menu.   The restaurant is usually quiet before 11am and I'm seated right away and drinks are ordered. Ambiance is a nice diner setting with lots of windows and decor that catches the eye. It's close to the CN tower too so you really feel like you're living the life in Toronto when you eat here (or at least, I do heh). Staff are very attentive even when it gets busy.   Price point is decent and I especially enjoy their home fries. You know that feeling when you see your server head towards you with your food? Yeah. I get that every time. Portions are of a good size so you'll definitely be leaving with a full tummy. I MISS IT ALREADY.   Overall, I definitely recommend evviva to friends when we're thinking of grabbing breakfast. In fact, I may just go again this weekend!"}
{"text":"My friend and I dropped by for brunch today, and Evviva exceeded expectations!  While we got lucky and snagged a table for two without a wait, the food nevertheless took awhile to come out. She ordered the avocado sandwich, or a grilled cheese sandwich with tomato and avocado on multigrain bread. I ordered the Montreal Lox breakfast sandwich. We both ordered sides of fries.  My friend said her sandwich was very good, as was mine. The fries were tasty, but really could have been hotter. I also ordered a Maple Latte, or a latte with maple syrup mixed in with the espresso. Made with Illy coffee, it was a decent cup.  The service was friendly, and the atmosphere was bright.   While I wouldn't go out of my way to go to Evviva, it is a place I'd consider again if in the area."}
{"text":"During our trip to Toronto, we went here twice. This was the first thing we ate when we got here & we came back before we left. The first time we came they were a bit busy but sat us right away. Service was fine & the food tasted great. I got the smoked salmon benedict & my bf had the grilled skirt steak. Both really good. The egg was a bit smaller than what I've seen for a poached egg but it's okay, still good. Their home fries are really good here, almost addicting. We left full & happy.   Now on our second trip here, we came on an early Tuesday morning, the first customers of the day. We sat & ordered our food, & didn't take that long to come out. I ordered the same thing as before. He ordered the chicken & waffles this time. Chicken was verrrrrry dry. Couldn't even chew through it to be very honest. But the waffle was dry as well. We had to ask for extra syrup & that didn't help much. So we tried to wrap it up because we had a flight to catch. While we were eating more people came, including a party of 6 I believe. There was only one server on the floor at this time so she was very busy. It took a really long time to get her attention for the check, we had to ask twice. I understand you're the only one on the floor & there are more people coming-- but that means it only makes sense to close out the ones that came first right? Perhaps not. We left very unsatisfied because of the lack of service we received on this second time, & truthfully this & another issue that morning together resulted in us missing our flight. Quite disappointing to say the least."}
{"text":"Really good food and coffee, but sadly ugly and poor service for early breakfast! Only to waitress for a crowded breakfast time is simply no sense..."}
{"text":"Love this place! I come here every once in a while on the weekend and it is DEFINITELY worth the wait. The service is always friendly and efficient, the coffee is fresh, and the food is so so satisfying. What I like most about their dishes is that they're not contrived.. just good ol' filling comfort food. It's also quite spacious compared to other brunch joints around the city, and the decor is on point. Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"We ate breakfast here twice during our vacation stay in the city. It was very good and not too bad of a price for being downtown. I would recommend it for a good breakfast spot."}
{"text":"So I stumbled upon this place on yelp of course & decided to have my last meal before I headed back to the states. I ordered the salmon Benedict & it was good. Real flavorful & my friends ordered the chicken & waffles & said it was good. I have 4 stars because of the service from the waiter, she kept getting our orders wrong & the wait was crazy. Will come back whenever I'm in town."}
