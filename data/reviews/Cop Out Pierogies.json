{"text":"The pierogies are unbelievable and the owners are wonderful. We don't get a chance to come out too often due to where we live and the hours they are open but when things line up.... I'm in Heaven.  We stopped by today and had the mac n cheese pierogies and the potato and cheese ones.  They also gave us a huge container of halushki to try... I think that it ranked right up there with the pierogies.  The owners are really down to earth and came over and talked to us and my 4 yr old.  Well worth the price."}
{"text":"Friendly service like family.  Generous portions.  Creative and tasty offerings.  Pierogies have often been underserved even in Pittsburgh.  Cop Out Pierogies is serving up justice to the polish dumplings with a variety of unique and delectable fillings!"}
{"text":"Fantastic people AND fantastic food! My husband introduced me to pierogies a long time ago. How can I ever eat frozen pierogies again? So spoiled now! This will be a must-stop every time we are in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I decided to try the pierogies  after I saw a groupon for them. I've always loved Pierogies Plus in McKees Rocks and will be going back soon! I am not a fan of the Cop Out pierogies at all. The dough is chewy and the filling lacked taste. I only tried the potato and cheese so far but the hot sausage and sauerkraut will have the same dough so unless the filling is out of the world then I won't be going back to buy more."}
{"text":"Great variety of Pierogies.  I tried the Thanksgiving and the Buffalo chicken.  Favorite was Buffalo chicken.  Friendly service and nice to see Pierogies being made onsite."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here based on the Yelp - they could not have been more right! They were fantastic. We're from Indianapolis, so sadly we could not take any frozen pierogies home afterwards, but we sure would have if we lived closer. They have numerous options - 5 times more than the pierogie shop here in Indy. Great work Carl and family!"}
{"text":"Gluten free flavors and selection are amazing! The rest of the family love the (non gluten free) dessert and the pot pie pierogies. The owners are always so friendly and helpful. We've come back almost every week for new orders-from the south hills. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"The cutest mom and pop shop in Pitt! We love cop out for their kind and homey feel, not to mention the fantastic food!!!

Would definitely come again and recommend to a friend!"}
{"text":"Name it, they have it! I didn't even know dessert pierogies exist. I loved the sweet potato and the chicken pierogies that we had but the dessert pierogies , esp fudge, would be the ones I liked most(but thn i have a sweet tooth :D) I am still to try the frozen ones i brought home, i bet they are great as others!!"}
{"text":"Carl Funtal is doing something *really* special in his little pierogie shop in Etna!!

First of all, you'll be hard pressed to find a more generous, charismatic, kind hearted person in the whole world, and that love can be tasted in the food-- no doubt. As a newbie to the pierogie scene (thanks, Chef Boyfriend, for bringing these little joys into my life!) Carl pulled out all the stops and let us do a tasting of some of his greatest hits. All I can say is: woof! I can't believe I didn't break the chair!! 

We had:
- the classic potato and cheese
- the Ruben (oh.my.god)
- the watermelon/jalapeño/chicken (say what?! Carl's homemade hot sauce takes it to the next level)
- pepperoni pizza (brilliant!)
- seafood (if Neptune were Polish, he'd eat these every day)
- chicken marsala (woah!)
- ... (this is right around the moment I blacked out into a coma of complete food bliss)
OH! We also had some boss homemade noodles that are super traditional, but the name escapes me. I can tell you, though, I would gladly eat my body weight in those perfect, buttery, little treats.

Save yourself the time and trouble of making your pierogies at home, and GO SEE CARL!! The guy is a pierogie manic in the very best way. If Yelp says the shop is closed, just give him a call-- seriously, chances are he's there and he'll sling you a dozen (or two)."}
{"text":"Great pierogies and the people are super nice. I have had pierogies from all over Pittsburgh and this place is as good as or better than anywhere else."}
{"text":"Every time I'm in from NY I stop here for 3-4 dozen of their creations. Great food, unique recipes and a couple of the friendliest people you'll ever meet. I'll be back again!"}
{"text":"I read the reveiws I went there because they said they were good... I bought fifty-six pierogies  and they didnt know the meaning of seasoning... Buffalo chicken was fine..mac and cheese know taste at all. Potatoe and cheese awful...Rueben still in freezer haven't tried the potatoes and kraut yet in freezer..The owner was quite pleasant and gave us samples of the Buffalo pierogie and the heath pierogie...they were tasty i was sold... Sorry to say Pierogie Plus is my place.."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb. I thought it was more of an actual restaurant, and less of a take-away-frozen-pierogies kind of place, so when we arrived it wasn't open for dining, but the owner cooked us up some pierogies anyway. The customer service was amazing. He even gave us some free dessert pierogies. There were so many different creative looking flavors...I wish I were able to try more! You can tell the owner is passionate and cares a great deal about the quality of his product. Even if the pierogies hadn't blown my mind, I would return just to support this guy. But the pierogies did blow my mind. Next time I'm in Pittsburgh I'm going to come prepared with a cooler so I can fill it up with these little pieces of heaven."}
{"text":"Carl saved the day!
I had someone from out of town who never had pierogies before. I went on a wild goose chase looking for the best pierogies and Cop Out was my go to place! When the initial call was made to order the food, Carl's daughter answered the phone, I told her my situation, she asked \"dad\" if he could help and there was zero hesitation! Carl informed me that he would indeed help me out, complete the order & cook the pierogies for me. As I entered cop out it was a father daughter team in a kitchen cooking pierogies, not what I expected but I was happy to see it. As soon as I walked in Carl approached me with a hot off the skillet pierogie in a paper towel and told me this was a sample of what I would receive. I ordered a dozen of potato, cheddar & jalapeno (A cop out dozen is 14!) Not only did I receive excellent phone service, got a pierogie while I was waiting but I also got a few extra uncooked pierogies to take home for later with instructions all for under $10. This place is just awesome, I wish every business was still run this way. These pierogies were excellent and worth the drive, awesome homemade everything. 

Taste - 5/5
Staff - 5/5
Helpfulness - 5/5
Selections - 5/5
Price - 5/5

Highly recommended!!! 
Thanks Carl!!!"}
{"text":"Best pierogies I've ever had. The buffalo chicken mac n' cheese filled pierogies were delicious! The owners were super friendly and welcoming. They gave us free samples of the dessert pierogies and hot sausage pierogies along with homemade applesauce. All of which were amazing. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"WOW to everything. When we went they were actually closed, but the owner had us in and made us food anyway! He also let us sample the peach dessert pierogies. Yum! We got the jalapeño pierogies with sour cream and onions and ate every last bite. Best meal in Pittsburgh!!"}
{"text":"So tasty. I had the potato and cheese pierogies and a quart of haluski to go. So delish. Made 4 meals out of it! Can't wait to try more flavors. And! The staff was super friendly."}
{"text":"Carl takes the personal tim to make sure his customers are greeted one on one .he comes up with festive ideas as well as traditional . My favorite is the jalopeno and cheddar he has something for everyone"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!! My mother-in-law and I were biking on the North Shore and were just randomly looking for a place to check out nearby. We stumbled upon this place, and it is one of the BEST gems I've discovered here in Pittsburgh. Their pierogies are so fresh, tender, and packed with flavor. We got the potato, cheddar & jalapeno ones and split them with my sister-in-law, and we were super satisfied. 

Carl, the owner, came out several times to check on our dining experience. He first came out with a free sample of a dessert pierogi he finished making, \"tagalong girl scout cookie\" flavored. YUM!! He then came out later to serve us our main course and came out a few more times to make conversation and ensure we were enjoying our meal. My M-I-L had mentioned how it was our first time and how it would be nice to try some other flavors, and Carl asked us to hang around because he wanted to see what was in his kitchen. So he brought us out a few \"extras\" he had in the kitchen to sample - NO CHARGE! So we got to try the buffalo chicken and the breakfast pierogies too. Soooooo good! And so thoughtful of him. Way to go, Carl! Your service and kindness are unmatched.

Carl and the rest of the staff there made us feel super welcome and important, and I cannot wait to share my experience with my friends. We are DEFINITELY making more stops back to this place. Everyone needs to check out Cop Out Pierogies, it is seriously the BEST! :)"}
{"text":"I used to go here all the time when I was pregnant.  The perogies are awesome.  Totally diverse menu- bacon and blue cheese perogies???!!! Come on- of course they are good."}
{"text":"Simply amazing, wish I could try them all! Place is just pumping out quality authentic Polish food! PA must visit food stop!"}
{"text":"A little place in Etna we had never heard of, but stumbled on while do some shopping on the street. There are a few tables there, but they seem more set-up for take out. We weren't sure what we wanted, but the people were nice enough to fry up a sample platter of 3 or 4 different ones.  They were all delicious, and we bought 2 bags of frozen ones to take home. The owners are very helpful in giving you cooking instructions if you are not familiar with cooking them. In my opinion, the best pierogies in a town full of them. Also a regular source so you don't have to wait until the local church has their yearly sale.  I haven't tried the dessert ones yet, but the sound very good."}
{"text":"We went today for the first time. The owners wife greeted us with samples of their cheesecake pierogies. They were great . They have several different kinds , makes it hard to choose. We also got a sample of halusky and stuffed cabbage . That was good also. I will definitely go back. Can t wait to try all the new flavors we bought, and it was small business Saturday."}
{"text":"Hands down the best pierogies I've ever had!

Both the Potato, Cheese & Jalapeño and Cheese & Feta were incredible. They were perfectly cooked and made us want to go back and try every filling.

They also brought out some delicious Peach Cheesecake and Mint Julep dessert pierogie samples for us. Very unique. I didn't know that dessert pierogies were even a thing before this.

The service was fantastic, very reasonably priced for the gargantuan amount of pierogies and they even treated our pup Zee to some kielbasa.

We will definitely be back. And then probably be back again after that."}
{"text":"Handmade perogis to cook yourself. So many choices. Personal Favorite - Mac & Cheese. This is a MUST do if you like Perogis."}
{"text":"First time stopping by Cop Out today.    My friends were in town and LOVE pierogies.   From the moment we walked in, the owner, Beth, was the biggest sweetheart.   She offered us cheesecake dessert pierogies and explained which ones to order as well as how to make them and when they taste the best.   We will def stop back and would recommend this place for everyone.   Thank you Beth, you defiantly gave THE BEST first impression.  I'd give you ten stars if I could.   

PS we'll be back with extra bourbon!"}
{"text":"Thanks again yelp and yelpers with helping me to discover yet another obscure but amazing find Cop Out Pierogies!  I had just received my weekly email about places around the burg focused on Dumplings, particularly pierogies.  Growing up in and around the burg it is just about inconceivable that you didn't eat these plump pillows of carbs at least on a few occasions.  I always preferred the homemade to Mrs. T though she drives a hard bargain since honestly pierogies may not be the most complicated thing to make; they are certainly very laborious and somewhat complicated to get perfect.  When I say perfect I mean the taste and texture as no two homemade dumplings look alike.

Cop Out Pierogies can be found on Butler St in Etna which was very close to my work though I didn't know of its existence until the email arrived in my inbox.  I spoke to a couple of co-workers that week and decided that Friday we were going to get some takeout.  There are a couple things to keep in mind before heading to Cop Out Pierogies.  They are only open on Friday and Saturday for a few hours.  They are also cash only, so hit the ATM before you set out to get your fix.  Lastly, and perhaps this is a personal problem, I found it a little tricky to find them.  Etna is about as small as you can get but if you don't go there often you may pass it up once or twice before finding it.

I and my co-workers all ordered the same pierogies the potato/cheese/and jalapeno.  For a dozen they give you 14, not too shabby!  I also got a pint of Haluski.  The price for the pierogies does increase if you have them cook them for you.  I got the understanding quickly that most people buy them frozen in large bags.  When I arrived to pick up our food, I was greeted with a line of others waiting.  I didn't have to wait too long, but as I did the cook/owner brought out a couple samples of a sweet potato pierogies for the patrons waiting or eating in the small dining area they have set up.  Nice touch to ease the pain of my empty stomach suffering even more from the wonderful smell coming from the kitchen.  So they call this joint Cop Out and as I read online the owner/cook was a sergeant with the Shaler Township Police Department.  The décor was cute, some toy cop cars, lots of pics of the burg, some newspaper write ups that I could only imagine was of the store but I didn't get close enough to read them.  To complete this atmosphere was five on duty police officers enjoying lunch in the dining area.  

Once waited on the food came out pretty quick, paid gave my thanks and off I went back to the office to enjoy my Polish lunch, and enjoy I did!  The pierogies were sautéed perfectly cooked with the creamiest smoothest texture encased inside the dumpling.  The spice from the jalapeno was nice and noticeable but definitely not overpowering.  They were in short delicious.  I could only finish half and took the rest home for dinner.  The Haluski was also very good but the pierogies stole the show for me.  Great stop if you find yourself in the area!"}
{"text":"Incredibly friendly and helpful service combined with delicious pierogies, you really can't go wrong here.

My favorite pierogies are from Pierogies Plus, however this place sells wonderfully wacky variations and it all tastes great. Pierogies Plus will always be my go-to for authentic fresh pierogies, however Cop Out pierogies are still fun and delicious.

I'm not sure why they sell mostly frozen pierogies, but if you follow their cooking instructions you will turn out with great pierogies.

They gave me some free samples to try, namely Reuben pierogies. I really recommend the spinach feta, they are great!

They also sell haluski, which I'd like to sample one day."}
{"text":"Sooooo Good! I came in 4 minutes to close and they were super nice to me. Lol. It looks like a Lil mom and pop joint, real cozy and laid back. A bunch of list of perogi on the counter when I walked in. I could of spent 80 bucks easily in that place. Everything looked really good, and it was! I took home some bomb stuffed cabbage, not just regular old stuffed cabbage either. This stuffed cabbage was a 9.8 good. Probably the best one I've ever had, and I've had quite a few. 

 Now to the perogi. I bought 2 bags (and the stuffed cabbage) for 20 or 25 bucks. Mac and cheese, and chicken marsala. She gave me a half dozen (at least) extra of a another flavor potato bacon blue cheese FOR FREE because I'd never been there, and they were spectacular. I brought it all home and made the PBBC. Mmmwah soooo perfect. I posted a pic of them with onions sautéed in butter and cottage cheese on the side (that's the way I eat all perogies) u should try it as a topping. I will go back and I would suggest yinz check it aaht*

*out in Pittsburghese"}
{"text":"Love, love, love. That is all I can say!

The service, the food, the pierogies!! All are top notch and I am so glad we came here.

From the moment you set foot in the door you are treated as family. We were graciously walked through the menu and my daughter was even taken back into the kitchen so she could fold her own pierogi.

We tasted the cheeseburger, traditional potato and cheese and the hot sausage. They brought out sautéed onions to go along with them which was a great add. My personal favorite was the cheeseburger but some of our group liked the sausage better.

We ended up getting 12 dozen to go since we loved them all so much, definitely a ringing endorsement for how much this Polish family enjoyed them!!"}
{"text":"I was finally able to stop @ Cop Out Pierogies last weekend. They are only open 2 days week so it's not that easy for me to get out there. I ordered a couple different pierogies to take home & try. And I also ordered 6 of the potato & cheese cooked to try there. The pierogies that I got cooked seemed a little doughy, I think they were not cooked long enough. 
However at home I cooked up a dozen of the spinach & feta, I followed the directions I received when I purchased the pierogies. I fried them in butter till they were crispy on both sides. They came out PERFECT! They didn't have that doughy feel or taste to them. Absolutely delicious!! I can't wait to try the other flavors I bought!
I love that they have many vegetarian flavors to choose from. Not just 1 or 2 chooses like so many other places. They have 5 or 6 vegetarian choices to choose from. 
Also they give you 14 pierogies in a dozen. How awesome is that?! And prices are fair. 
The lady taking your order & the owner are very friendly. The owner/chef gave my husband & I a dessert pierogie for free to try while we were placing our order. Strawberry cheesecake pierogie...delicious! 
Definitely worth trying Cop Out Pierogies & worth making the drive to. You can always stock up & freeze them."}
{"text":"Back in town from LA. Was craving good pierogi and haluski and found this spot on yelp. Reasonable prices, an amazingly creative menu, ate in but they have a busy to-go service (testament to their delicious food). Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Is Carl a genius? Is he a mad scientist? Consider me a good pierogie virgin- sure, we've all opened up boxes of Mrs. T's back east for an afternoon snack. Hell, I've even made halfway decent homemade ones before. But these are something special. Between the pierogies here and at Church Brew (please, please collaborate- if you make a beer can chicken with one of their brews, I'll never leave!) I'm in potato heaven. I snagged a dozen of their habanero/tequila/watermelon/chicken- hot damn! As soon as I got home, I made three per the instructions. The dough is top-notch, the filling is perfectly balanced and stuffed to the gills, and the flavors are impeccable. It's spicy, sweet, and fruity all at once. What a seasonal special. I'll be back for more, and I couldn't have asked for a better snack than the fried banana split 'rogie on my way out. Excellent food, overshadowed only by the kindness and hospitality of the establishment."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I found this place! I just moved to Pittsburgh a few months ago and saw this place on yelp while looking up things to do and eat around the city. I even got a great coupon!

It took me a few weeks to line up my schedule with theirs, but it was so worth it when I did. The owner's wife took care of me. She was super sweet and friendly, explaining how to cook the pierogies as well as giving me a set of printed instructions. I've never made/had pierogies before so this was very much appreciated! I was a few dollars short (bring cash!!) and instead of waiting for me to run around to find an ATM, she told me take them and when I protested she said \"just come back to visit\". With service like that, how could you not?! 

The pierogies themselves perfectly complimented the spectacular service. I cooked them later that day for myself and a guest. We tried the buffalo chicken, Reuben, and lekvar (plum--tasted like a date paste) flavors. So. Good. The Reuben was my favorite but I have a feeling there's no such thing as a bad choice here!

I'll have to stop in to try more flavors and keep my promise. I think I'll even bring some home for the holidays!"}
{"text":"Amazing pierogies.  We tried 7-8 different kinds, all excellent.  We were treated so well when we ate there for lunch. Small space, but a couple tables if you want to eat there.  I only wish they were open more frequently!"}
{"text":"Super! We had a great meal of Reuben pierogis and buffalo chicken pierogis. There are only a couple of tables but you can order to go and frozen pierogis also. If you do stay to eat in, you can watch the staff members as they stand around a large kitchen table pinching fresh pierogis!  Good food done right."}
{"text":"LOVE this hidden treasure!! We went and got the potato, jalapeño, and cheese perogies and the western omelet perogies. The western omelet perogies were great, but the potato jalapeño cheese ones were so amazing my mouth is watering just talking about them!  

You can order them either frozen to take home or have them fry them up there for you. I definitely recommend having them cook them for you, because the way they're fried up can't be beat!  

The owners are just an absolute joy to be around, and I can't wait to go back to visit again. 

Just be sure to check the hours before you go!"}
{"text":"These are absolutely the best pierogis I have ever had. My wife and I decided to get the chicken parm and strawberry cheesecake to take home and they were both awesome! I definitely suggest giving cop out pierogis a try if you get the opportunity."}
{"text":"The planets must have been aligned today as I was lucky enough to be at Cop Out pierogies while they were open.  I ordered a dozen hot sausage and a dozen reuben (frozen) to have later with dinner.  Well we just got finished eating and Wow....  I have made, bought, and eaten my fair share of pierogies over the years and these were some of the best.  I got to talk with the owner while I was there and he seems like a great person.  In fact he gave me half of his own sandwich as a sample of what he will be serving.  I will definitely be a returning customer, as the food is great and the owner is one hell of a stand up guy."}
{"text":"A small hole-in-the-wall restaurant; we definitely did not expect such a wonderful pierogi bar in the middle of Etna!  The awesome service was surpassed only by the two dozen delicious pierogies, some delicious haluski, and cabbage rolls."}
{"text":"Three-star food with five star service. The quality of the perogies was very good, but they aren't my favorite. The stuffed cabbage had good flavor but lacked sauce volume and appeared to have been microwaved on the reheat. 

The desert perogies were the highlight!  They reminded us of a crab Rangoon :) but in a sweet perogie style."}
{"text":"Me and my fiancé had a chance to come here after hearing about the different selections and the fact they had gluten free ones for my mom. We were greeted so nicely and the chef and the lady at the front counter. We spent a good 45 minutes talking and I sampled a few things he had in the works. Everything was really good. The gluten free was fantastic and the dessert pierogies were so so good as well. We got the Buffalo chicken and pot/kraut/bacon ones for dinner and then the cookies n cream for dessert (haven't made yet). The pot/kraut/bacon tasted like the new years meal my mom makes all in a pierogi. The buffalo chicken had a good kick to it and if I did it again would probably make a spicy sauce to go on them as well. We will make the dessert ones tomorrow.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who loves good Ole polish comfort food, or anyone who's never had a pierogi(yes, those people exist). Also bring cash or a check! Though PNC is right around the corner!"}
{"text":"Let me just preface this review by saying that I have never liked pierogies before. I have tried them time and time again, and just have never liked them. But my life has now been changed by Carl and his wife, who are some of the nicest shop-owners we have ever met. Their pierogies and haluski were to-die-for when we ate them in the store. Carl whipped a few up for us to try - we tried the cherry cheesecake (INCREDIBLE), chicken parm, and haluski. Absolutely amazing. We bought a whole bunch and cooked some of them up. They didn't taste quite as yummy as they did when Carl prepared them...the dough was very thick. I'm not sure if I did something wrong or if the ones he prepared were fresh rather than frozen, but I will definitely go back and try them again next time I'm in town! For the time being, I'd suggest having him whip them up for you - they were awfully tasty."}
{"text":"My husband has wanted to go here for a few years and we finally made it on an anniversary trip into the city. We got lucky cause they had a bag of the pilgrim pierogies. They don't usually have them this time of year.  I wasn't sure about this combo but it was delicious. Had the pepperoni pizza ones tonight for dinner. Awesome also. Can't wait to go back and try the Reuben, Mac n cheese and a few dessert ones. Love this place"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stopped here since we both are big pierogie fans. I got the potato/bacon/blue cheese pierogies and they were awesome. A little more blue cheese flavor maybe but still a really, really good pierogie; would definitely get again. She got the mac and cheese, which was exactly that, just mac and cheese inside a pierogie.  They were ok, a little dry; a delicious concept.  We're still very excited to try the other \"editions\" on the menu and to get some frozen for the house.  Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Just a last minute decision to stop for lunch. Best decision of the week. Great Polish platter. And a short walk home. Afternoon may be shot for digestion"}
{"text":"Husband and I have made our way through 2 of the 3 bags of frozen pierogies we purchased via Groupon a few weeks ago.  We purchased a bag of a \"dozen\" (14) of each of the following flavors:
* potato, bacon, and bleu cheese
* chicken parmesan
* gyro

Each of the above rang up for $9.25 per \"dozen,\" though the more traditional pierogies (potato, cheese, sauerkraut) are a couple bucks cheaper and the dessert pierogies are slightly cheaper.  Cop Out also offers seafood-filled pierogies that are quite a bit more expensive.  Lots of options.

Good flavors and quality ingredients.  It seems these handmade pierogies are prepared with care, with filling ingredients dispersed evenly throughout.  The directions provided--I went with the boiling technique and then pan-finished with margarine--were easy to follow and worked well, thank goodness; I'm no pierogie expert! 

Cop Out is only open on Fridays and Saturdays and for a limited number of hours, so plan ahead.  We didn't realize the tight schedule until a few weeks before our Groupon expired and had to scramble to use the Groupon on the very last day.  Totally our fault, but just a heads up."}
{"text":"Outstanding. We were visiting from Michigan and wanted the best pierogis in town- but sadly it looked like these guys were closed on Thursdays. I called on a whim and they were working in the kitchen to prepare for the next day. They kindly let us in and made us the best pierogis we have ever had, plus something special that wasn't even on the menu. Don't be safe and order potato and cheese- try the craziest flavors on the menu and you won't be disappointed! The Ruben ones were to die for. What a great owner & staff too. We'll be back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Hidden gem alert! This adorable little shop tucked into the main street of the oft-overlooked neighborhood of Etna is pierogie heaven. The shop itself is very small, consisting of a long counter for ordering, and a few tables for dining in (note: the dine-in hours are very limited, as are the hours in general, so be sure to check before you go). It seems to mostly do take out business for their frozen pierogies. They sell them in a \"cop's dozen\" (14 to a pack), with tons of flavors to choose from, ranging from the traditional (e.g., potato and cheese) to the modern (e.g., buffalo chicken, Thanksgiving dinner). Prices are very reasonable, ranging from $7.25 to $9.25 for the cop's dozen.

We opted to buy three flavors -- potato and cheese, chicken parm, and pepper butt (made with horseradish and pork butt from Parma in the Strip). We took our sacks of loot home and immediately cooked a few up. These are the real deal, people! The pierogie shells were perfectly tender, silken, and chewy without being too thick or doughy. There were generous amounts of flavorful fillings in each. The potato filling was smooth and delightfully cheesy in the traditional pierogies, while the chicken parm filling tasted remarkably like chicken parm! Lots of chicken, tomato sauce and cheese oozing out of each one. Delicious! I didn't try the pepper butt pierogie, but my husband simply kept repeating, \"Oh WOW,\" as he was devouring those, so I'm pretty sure they were a winner as well. I could definitely taste the homemade love baked into each one of these.

Our in-store experience was everything I love about supporting small businesses. The owner's wife helped us out, and she was wonderfully chatty and friendly, talking about her family, the neighborhood, and, of course, the pieorgies. Such a great experience. She even threw in a couple of extra free pierogies that were 'broken leftovers' so we could try another flavor (reuben) at home. So sweet!! 

I do sort of wish that they sold their pierogies individually so that you could try all of their flavors without committing to an entire dozen. But since they mostly do frozen take out, I can see logistically why they don't. The owner's wife did say they are trying to expand into the store next door so they can be more of a restaurant, and I hope it works out for them!

They definitely have a fan in me, and I will be back next time I need to get my pierogie fix!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went here for lunch on Saturday, and it was absolutely the best experience of all places we've ever been to.  They treated us like family (\"cousins\") and made our first experience an awesome one.  My girlfriend had never tried haluski or pierogies before and now it has become one of her favorite things to eat.   The pig-in a blanket was fantastic and the chocolate filled pierogie dessert was great too.  We will be returning to this place soon enough.  Awesome, just awesome."}
{"text":"Pierogies are home made and couldn't be more delicious. Reasonably priced Cop Out is in the small community of Etna outside of Pittsburgh. Easy to find with accessible parking I would highly recommend for anyone who loves pierogies.  You can eat there or take home your pierogies to cook at home. I ate there yesterday with my brother and went back today so my husband could have some. Once he tasted his \"pepperoni pizza\" pierogies and one of my \"cheeseburger\" pierogies he understood.  Did I mention there are \"14\" in a dozen!  After eating my husband went next door to a hardwood store and picked up a couple items while I went next door on the other side and purchased chocolate at \"Pollock's\" home made candy store. What a nice experience we had today.  A word of caution there are just a few tables inside and they're high stools. But I was able to get a set two days in a row. Do yourself a favor and check it out! Loved it."}
{"text":"Terrific local place - friendly owner offered samples of the PIErogies - a banana split variation. We ordered 4 and a half dozen pirogues for our group. Tried Gluten Free Spinach and Feta, it was amazing and I was so glad to be able to enjoy pirogues with my friends and family. They tried cheeseburger (very good), kraut bacon potato (smokey and very good), potato and onion (really good) and pepperoni pizza (simply amazing!! Everyone's favorite) the price was very reasonable $7-9 per cops dozen (14).  We will definitely go back when we visit our friends the next time."}
{"text":"This place was the friendliest place you could possibly hope for. The pierogies are takeout so you have to cook them but once you do, foodgasm. We were given samples of the cherry cheesecake pierogies while we were deciding and ended up coming home with chicken Marsala, buffalo chicken, breakfast, and macaroni and cheese. We cooked a few of each and they were absolutely delicious. We will be going back next weekend to try some new flavors."}
{"text":"Fantastic.    What a great experience     Owner treated me like family and the food was great.  When I'm back in Pennsylvania.  I'm coming back to this place !"}
{"text":"Step 1: Measure the amount of free space in your freezer.
Step 2: Drive to Cop Out (with CASH) on one of the days that they're open (Wed, Fri, and Sat).
Step 3: Eat some delicious prepared pierogies and fall in love.
Step 4: Buy a huge amount of pierogies that will just barely fit in the carefully measured space in your freezer.

The reuben and gyro ones were fantastic, perfectly seasoned, and went really well with the provided sour cream. We also tried the jalapeno, potato, and cheese...we enjoyed these, but they were less standout (plenty spicy, though!). The dough was a perfect thickness--just a tiny bit chewy, and nicely steam-fried to crisp perfection.

If you want delicious, unique (and very affordable!) eats in a place that makes you feel like family on your first visit, head on down to Cop Out!"}
{"text":"This place was tiny.  Just a three little tables, but the chef and his wife are warm, friendly, and full of humor!  The food was delicious.  The buffalo chicken pierogies were delicious, and the price is remarkably low for the quality of the food.  Our pierogies were served with a side of grilled onions and sour cream-as all pierogies should be served.  I only wish this place was closer to home!!"}
{"text":"Carl Funtal is quite possibly the nicest human being to ever run a business! We tasted the most phenomenal dessert pierogies and he was happy to answer all 100 of our questions. Best 'rogies in the Burgh!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been wanting to try this place for a long time. We finally decided to get the $20 for $15 deal on YELP and it was fantastic. It appears you can eat in or take your pierogies home and cook them yourself (which is what we decided). From the moment we stepped in the door the woman at the desk was busy, but she was SO helpful. We decided to get the pilgrim (tastes like a thanksgiving dinner), and the hot sausage.. We decided for a while honestly because there's so many types! Both were awesome! We have leftovers still in the freezer to cook for another day, and plan on going back here to try some more. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Best pierogies in Pittsburgh! I ordered the potato cheese jalapeno pierogies w/ onions and couldn't get enough. Their pierogies will forever have a spot in my freezer, no joke, I will always have a stash. Cop Out is geared towards being a to-go place, especially since the pierogies are frozen and ready for you to take home. They do offer to cook them for you right there (w/ or w/o onions). However, there are only two small tables to sit at. So just as long as no one else beats you to it, you can eat there. But wait! It gets even better... Cop Out is BYOB. Did somebody say six pack and pierogies??

The selection here is out of this world! Anything you could ever want stuffed inside is available or can be available. They even have numerous dessert pierogies. I tried some samples of a cheesecake version with chocolate frosting and M&M's... O-M-G! Totally exceptional and unlike anything I've had before (more on that later). Cop Out has that awesome mom-and-pop shop vibe. The owner, is a retired police officer, he and his wife were the only ones there working on a Saturday afternoon. The wife was operating the register and taking orders, while her husband was making all the magic happen in the kitchen. Very cool spot, very old school, and so very Pittsburgh.

Now let me tell you about the most exceptional customer service I've ever received in my entire life! It was my first time at Cop Out. Upon entering, the owners wife greeted me and explained the menu. There were a few other patrons she was helping, as well. When I made my decision and finally ordered, she offered me the delicious samples I mentioned earlier! As if that wasn't enough, she boxed up a bunch for me to take home... free of charge. I sat in a high stool in the corner while I waited for my food, the wife chatted to us casually. She told us stories of how she met her husband and a little bit about the business. Her husband brought out some orders and introduced himself to everyone. They were both so friendly. It was a shock... you don't find hospitality like that in too many places these days. (Okay, let's be real... you can't find service like that anywhere.)

Then to top it all off, when my food was ready, as the wife handed me my order, she threw in an additional to-go container. All she said was \"My husband is doing a giveaway\". It was a large container of Haluski, again free of charge! She gave me some basic heating directions and sent me on my way. (When I say large, I mean it fed three adults dinner the following night and of course it tasted amaaaazing!) They left such a great impression on me, I had to share in length how amazing they were. 

Please go here and meet them for yourself!"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! These are probably the best pierogies I've had! I bought a groupon for this place and finally tried it out, I was not disappointed! 

We tried the pepperoni pizza, potato and cheese, and sauerkraut bacon pierogies. All of these were delicious and I can't wait to try more variations! 

When I walked in they had samples of strawberry cheesecake dessert pierogies, they were delicious! A few minutes later a tray of butterfinger ones were brought out, also delicious! 

They lightly sauté the pierogies with some butter and onions which is exactly how I like them and then serve them with sour cream! 

Everyone that works there is super sweet and friendly it's a really nice little home town type of place."}
{"text":"Great friendly service and awesome food with abundant and creative selections! I highly recommend Cop Out Pierogies!! And my dog loved the seafood ones, as he got into them on our way home..."}
{"text":"You have so many different choices of piergoies! Amazing food and friendly people! At least try it out"}
{"text":"Amazing experience! My friends were visiting from Indianapolis and Long Island and they wanted pierogies. I live about five minutes away from this place that is truly unique to Pittsburgh. We all bought several dozen to take home.  (14 pierogies in a dozen!) While we were waiting for his sweet and wonderfully friendly wife to grab our pierogies, Carl Funtal brought us out hot, buttery pierogies to eat: spinach and feta (amazing) and the pilgrim which is Thanksgiving dinner in a perfect pierogie. They went far out of their way to pack up my friends' frozen pierogies in Styrofoam coolers with cold packs! Who does that??? What a hidden treasure this place is!"}
{"text":"Bet Pierogies around!! Great traditional Pierogies as well as plenty of creative offerings!!! 
Want somehting really creative, try the PIErogies.....Like cherry cheesecake, or Bavarian cream!! OMG!! Just try them once and you'll be hooked!!!"}
{"text":"The best.  Simply fantastic.  Definitely going back.

Only open a few hours a week but do yourself a favor and sync your schedule with there's and get down there."}
{"text":"BEST pierogis in the burgh! We called ahead for a huge order and they even made a couple custom ones for us. The mac and cheese wasn't my fave but the potato, potato and cheese, bacon, and others were great. Not a lot of seating but it wasn't super busy."}
{"text":"So good! They're just like the pierogi I make with my Polish grandma, with more flavors. We had the chicken parm, pilgrim, potato/bacon/sauerkraut, and fudge. 

Watch out for their unusual opening hours and cash only policy, but otherwise it's well worth the drive across town!"}
{"text":"Used the Yelp offer - what a great deal.  I attempted to go to Cop Out twice before successfully going on a Saturday afternoon.  The people there are delightful.  Also, I had in my head that Etna was kind of far away, but it is like, five minutes from Lawrenceville.  Totally worth it regardless.

The standard potato and cheese were lovely.  You get 14 in a batch and I feel like they are bigger than Piergoies Plus (which has burned me one too many times).  They have great flavors like pilgrim (like a gobblerito in a pierogie), hot sausage, bacon bleu cheese, blueberry cheesecake, and other crazy goodness.

This will be my new stop for pierogies when I get them for my sister who lives out east."}
{"text":"Love this small town place! Great old fashioned pierogies made and served by the nicest people. Make the effort and check this place out!"}
{"text":"The pierogies were out of this world!!!  And the owner/chef came out to meet us and discuss which pierogies we might like-- and then after we had them (yum!), they told us how to cook them.  We ended up buying 5 dozen and 2 dozen made it back all the way to San Diego, thanks to me finding some dry ice to keep them frozen.  You can't go wrong with this place; just make sure they are open when you are ready to go!"}
{"text":"We just struck pierogi (black) n gold!!! The owner saw us looking in the window on a day they are closed and opened his kitchen to us! Did I mention that I LoVe Pittsburgh people? Sampled the Mac and cheese and Ruben and walked out with 4 dozen!!!!!!"}
{"text":"It was my first time here and the pierogies and haluski were very good! I purchased the potato and cheese and the chicken parm. While I was waiting I was handed a free peanutbutter pierogie with chocolate syrup on top and to my surprise it was excellent!"}
