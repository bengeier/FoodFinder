{"text":"I popped in here for lunch and the food was tasty and the service was very good. I ordered the Pacific Halibut \"Hot Dog\" and it was a different take on the concept. If you are expecting a traditional type of hot dog then this isn't for you but if you want to try something different, I don't think you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great menu, great quality food.  Enjoyed a drink in the lounge before dinner. Definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Had a fabulous night at the Nash. I had the duck, which was amazing. My boyfriend had the rib eye steak, which was also delicious. We got a side of fries, which were tasty as well. Finished it off with the decadent chocolate mousse. Service was nice, though the bar was really \"backed up\" that night, which means the drinks took quite a while. Lovely atmosphere, look forward to returning."}
{"text":"I will never go to the Nash again. They were rude, disrespectful and outrageously priced.

My friend made reservations for 8:30 PM. When she came in, the hostess told her she made a mistake and her reservation was for 9:00 PM. After arguing with her and refusing to take responsibility for their error, we sat in the bar waiting for our table. At 9:10 PM (40 minutes after our reservation), they seated us and still didn't apologize or offer even a free loaf of bread. My husband and I ended up sharing a meal - he had a cran & soda, I had soda & lime, two loaves of bread as appetizers, a beet salad and pork chops. It cost us $90! While the food was good and the table service was good, there's not a chance in hell I will ever return because of the sheer rudeness and pomp of the hostesses."}
{"text":"Had a fabulous lunch on the patio at The Nash.  Our waiter recommended a refreshing cocktail to start off and was very helpful on lunch options.  Great service, great food and a fabulous place to stop while out and about on the a weekend!   Highly recommend and looking forward to the next time."}
{"text":"I was so excited to check out The Nash. I work in Inglewood, and my work team likes to have lunch out together every month or so. The Nash has been on our wish list for a while.

First impressions: the restaurant is gorgeous. Beautiful decor, a great mixture of the industrial exposed piping and nice rustic wooden tables. The tables are all set elegantly - I love the tea-towel napkins.

The menu looks interesting - certainly very meat-focused, but luckily I'm not vegetarian. The average lunch item was about $18 for a burger or sandwich.

Of the ten of us at the table, we each felt an overwhelming sense of 'meh' about our items. Several had the burgers, all noted that the salad has a great dressing, but they felt the burger was over seasoned: heavy on the oregano-type herbs. 

I ordered the reuben. The sandwich itself was nice, piled high with meat and lots of cheese. The mustard was very light, I personally prefer a more zingy mustard, but it was still a decent reuben. There was a side of pickles, and a side of chips. When I say side, keep in mind I mean six potato chips (I counted.) That would have been ok if the chips were freshly made but they were cold, so even if they were made in-house it wasn't to order. The chips were too heavily salted to finish. It seems like they just subbed in Old Dutch kettle chips and thrown on some coarse salt.

My table-mate ordered the reuben as well, and asked if he could switch the sides out for coleslaw. The server said that wasn't possible as the coleslaw was only served with the brisket. He asked her to check if it was possible. She came back with the reuben with the standard sides, as well as a side dish of coleslaw and charged him for it, which seemed a bit cheap. He would have prefered the server say \"no, I'm sorry we can't make substitutions, would you like a side order?\" The coleslaw was bot edible as it was sour instead of tangy like a good slaw should be.

Staff was efficient and friendly - no complaints there. Essentially this is a great looking place, with a staff who obviously are good at what they do, but it all falls apart on the food. The food is your basic diner-level food, but certainly not at diner-level prices. 

There are so many great places in Inglewood, I'm disappointed that The Nash isn't one of them."}
{"text":"Met the boys for a Friday lunch at The Nash. I have dined in Inglewood many times, but had no idea about this gem. Upon entering the establishment, I immediately felt under dressed. Fortunately, we were sitting in the Off Cut Bar.  The decor is amazing! Our table top, for example, was cleverly supported by repurposed radiators.

Our server was quick to greet us, hand over menus and take our drink order. Tap beers are from a local craft brewery, but I cannot recall the name. The IPA was delicious nonetheless.

Onion soup was recommended so I took the suggestion along with the burger and added the smoked bacon which is done in house and the green salad as a side. My Dining Buds ordered a Rueben and a salmon dish. Food arrived promptly - fresh and hot! Needless to say conversation ended as we tucked into our food. Absolutely delicious!!

No dessert takers, but sampled a couple other brew varieties. Have to find out the name!

Give The Nash a try! Awesome!"}
{"text":"Not a stellar start for Michael Noble.  As a regular to Notable I was highly anticipating trying out the Nash.  The food quality is the same as Notable but the portions??? wtf???. 

 I order shrimp/scallop dip at Notable and it is substantial.  I order risotto with shrimp at Nash??? 3 shrimp ring size shrimp (not large prawns) and an ice cream scoop of risotto for $16.  Seriously dont try to recoup the cost of opening a restaurant off of one customer alone.  

I order tagliatelle at Notable and its substantial.  Oder gnochetti at Nash?  had to reorder as there wasnt enough to go around.

I order duck at Nash, I get what seems to be 1/2 a breast, a little overdone and served in a bowl.  Maybe you want to save on the cherry bing sauce so you make the customer collect it at the bottom of the bowl???, but I dont like cutting meat in a bowl.

Service was very good except my  waitress was the only one who found the need to stretch her shirt neck to show her cleavage where no other staff members shirt was stretched so much, lol.  But she was attentive.

Food was good and on par with Notable but nothing a level higher or more complex to justify 1/2 portions.  I mean risotto with 3 tiny shrimp?  whats the food cost there? $2 and you charge $16.  

Won't be making the trip across town for this.  If you have a recipe for success why mess with it?  This is a recipe with 1/2 portion appetizers with full portion prices.  Regular Notable customers ... no need to rush out and try this establishment accross town."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a business trip.   Awesome flat iron steak.  Delicious garlic bread appetizer.  Not a fan of the homemade iced tea, however.  Attentive wait staff and friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"We in Montgomery are jealous Chef Noble is sharing his talent.  Notable has been a major driver in the change we are seeing as a community.
The Nash is fabulous."}
{"text":"Our server, Kate, was a rock star! Food was good. The atmosphere was elegant but comfortable. Very bright for lunch.  The rustic tables were a little uneven for one of diners and the seats were a bit uncomfortable at the tall tables, but it was a great work lunch."}
{"text":"The Nash = exceptional food + very poor service
Notable = exceptional food + exceptional service

We sat at a table with a clear view of the servers station. It was very upsetting to see the staff  having such a grand time visiting with each other while the customer was waiting and waiting and waiting......

I hope the staff at The Nash can be tutored by the experienced staff at Notable - quickly!"}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday dinner with 6 friends.  They insisted we could only eat at 5:30 or 8:30 with a group that large.  My friend who organized had to pay $100 deposit in advance which was returned to her as a Nash gift card.  Ridiculous.  Server was friendly but incompetant, kept disappearing while taking our order.  Served one of us wine while two others were still waiting to order?  Very odd.  They were out of many things on the menu.  All the food was mediocre and very salty.  My friend ordered the duck and specified she wanted steamed vegetables, but they brought her lamb with sauteed vegetables.  She had to ask three times for it to be changed and in the end she got her veggies but just gave up and ate the lamb.  Did I mention all the food was incredibly salty?  And I like salt.  For those prices, I wanted it to be delicious like Rouge or even Notable.  Then at the end of the night our waiter disappeared even though we desperately wanted to pay our bill.  Nobody seemed to be chomping at the bit to get in on the 8:30 seating that was supposedly behind us.  

I don't think I will be back - however the decor is absolutely lovely. I love the historic Calgary influences.  Great job to the interior designers.

Edited to add - my friend who had the mix up with her meal did get her meal comped.  So that is appreciated."}
{"text":"The best Ni√ßoise Salad  I've ever had and pretty much everything else I have had from the menu. The drinks are not bad either :)"}
{"text":"Enjoyed dinner immensely. Four different meals were ordered by our group and all were great. Loved the atmosphere and the service was great!"}
{"text":"I HATE having to give The NASH a measly 2 star rating, since I love Notable so much but....here it goes.
We were greeted quickly and sat at one of the long communal tables at the very front of the restaurant, next to the expediter who handles the food.  Our server was fantastic. She was very friendly, and efficient.She check on us and refilled our coffee/water without us asking.
The decor is beautiful. They did a great job of keeping the historical element of the old National Hotel, and creating a spacious but warm environment.
What's my issue then? First, the food.
I ordered the pulled chicken sandwich, and I chose the King Oyster mushroom soup as a side. My mother had the burger with the soup as well.
My sandwich was TINY, I mean 7 bites and it was gone. It tasted no different than something I would get at Sunterra. No distinctive flavours and very little meat inside. The soup was creamy and rich but I cant say the meal was worth the money I paid.
Same goes for the burger. While it was substantial in size, it was a tad dry, and tasted very plain. It was topped with standard toppings. I guess I expect a bit of pizzaz  when paying  $18 for a burger. Especially when Calgary has a ton of places that do a wonderful job of stacking beef patties for a lot less.
My other bone to pick was during almost our entire meal, there were staff at the other end of the table, talking, texting, eating, coming and going. Between their loud conversations and the expediter announcing he needed staff to take the food to their tables, it was quite distracting.
Needless to say, I dont think I'll be giving Nash another go."}
{"text":"The food was good but the waiter was extremely rude the whole time and the tip was already pre added to the bill...."}
{"text":"4+ stars for the Offcut Bar, 3.5 for the restaurant. The ambience of the bar is lively, and distinct from the restaurant section. The drinks are expensive, but unique, strong and well crafted (they have an extensive tinctures station at the bar), and the menu doesn't take itself too seriously (there are nods to The National Hotel's unsavoury past). The bar is sizeable, and has a clear view of the quasi-open kitchen. My waitress was very accommodating in terms of trying to find a wine to suit my palate as we transitioned over to dinner. The dinner menu at The Nash does not stray too far from the successful offerings at Chef Michael Noble's original Montgomery restaurant, the typographically cringe-worthy NOtaBLE. There are a few appetizers, artisan in-house bread, a number of fire-roasted meats and a handful of other entr√©es. This is a traditional high-end comfort N. American menu that won't insult anyone's palate. The pork belly was well rendered, but could have used a bit more pop from fennel or star anise for extra points, especially when paired with the well-saut√©ed scallops. Draped with nage, it was a satisfying portion. At $34 a plate, it was exactly what I'd expect in terms of quality, if not pushing any culinary boundaries. This new restaurant brings finer dining to Inglewood (albeit with t-shirted waiters, and cabin-cum-studio decor), but with the current menu doesn't add much to the overall Calgary scene beyond the original NOtaBLE."}
{"text":"I went here for a birthday dinner a few weeks after it had opened and wasn't impressed by their food. With the prices they have, I would have thought I'd get food that tasted well and satisfying,  but I unfortunately didn't get that.  I ordered an apple pie dessert which didn't taste or even look much close to your usual apple pie. My plate had shredded pieces of green apple with some crumbs and few pieces of cooked apple underneath the crumbs. It tasted horrible.  I couldn't believe I wasted money on it. Also, the size of the \"apple pie\" was so small I was surprised when the waitress placed on the table before me. Even my friend sitting beside me laughed when he saw it and asked what it was I ordered. Another friend at the dinner ordered their ganachd dessert which she didn't like at all. I don't plan to come to this place again, even though the restaurant's interior design looks nice."}
{"text":"Excellent all around.  The service, the ambiance, the food, the wine, the cocktails, the plenty of parking out back!  Must try.  If you are looking for big portions for a decent price, this is not your place.  If you are a foodie, looking to delight your tastebuds, or looking for a great date spot, come home to The Nash!"}
{"text":"While visiting Calgary I had the pleasure of experiencing the Nash. Maybe it was my company... but the food was top notch and the service was impeccable. I would recommend making a reservation because this place seems quite popular among the locals. We walked in around 5:30p on a Saturday and the hostess was able to seat us at the bar where we could watch the meat master work his magic on the wood oven grill. I ordered the Duck confit ravioli for starter and my only complaint would be that I wish I had more but it is very rich so I can see why the small portion. We ordered the AAA flat iron and rib eye for the entrees. WOW is all I can say. Clearly, Alberta does not mess around when it comes to beef. Best steak I have had in a while and this is coming from someone who often orders a $200 Wagyu steak in Vancouver. My friend fed me some of the fat on the rib eye and it melted in my mouth.. I was mind boggled how delicious it was - I usually cut the fat off! The chef working the grill had some impressive techniques and inspired me. Our server was a total babe and very sociable (too bad he's engaged ladies) his service was fantastic and he could recommend a wine pairing without me even picking up a list. Classy atmosphere, good looking and friendly staff, top notch chefs. I would recommend sitting at the bar to watch the chefs in action - you rarely find this kind of performance and dedication in Vancouver! Also, ask for the yam gnocchi - I wish I ordered a side of it."}
{"text":"I loved the dining experience at The Nash, and the OffCut Bar! We started at the Offcut Bar, while we were waiting to get in on the waitlist to The Nash for dinner. The wait was about an hour but we enjoyed a glass of wine or two and visited. It was busy and loud, and fun. The room has a great atmosphere and the room is a very interesting mix of old and new. I had a fantastic dinner at The Nash as well.  I had the Sirloin Steak and it was cooked to absolute perfection. I was blown away! We ordered the Notable bottle of wine which was great as well. We had room for dessert and shared the rhubarb stilton cheesecake, and the Chocolate mousse. I would order the Chocolate mousse again, but the cheesecake was too small and very stilton-y...which made for mixed reviews at our table. Great atmosphere, cool part of town, great parking, amazing food and lovely service from our server who was also a studied sommelier. Very impressed and going back as soon as possible for round two!"}
{"text":"My bday brunch was hosted at The Nash on a Saturday afternoon and we all (party of 18) loved it. The d√©cor is modern and cool, but still has a home kitchen feel with lots of natural light. It occupies a large open space which was almost full. The restaurant staff were incredibly accommodating and our server was excellent. Food and drinks were a little slow coming, but not totally unexpected for a new restaurant. The presentation and quality of food was excellent with some interesting items - delicious rosti which takes the place of boring ol' hasbrowns. The cinnamon bun is a MUST. One to share between four people is more than enough. Also, I can't recommend the ceasar ENOUGH. By far the best I have had in the city and they don't even overcompensate with ridiculous garnish. I'm excited to try dinner at The Nash next time, but as far as brunch goes, definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"This is probably the restaurant where i've had the best wooden fire cooked chicken! The atmosphere is amazing, elegant decorations, amazing service, best food! We felt spoiled by the chefs with such amazing dishes! Thank you for this! And congratulations!"}
{"text":"From the moment we walked in, the service was impeccable! Josh made sure we were comfortable and at ease :)
Our waiter was very friendly, and also helpful with helping us choose between dishes.
The food was superb-we were only going to have a quick bite, but ended up splitting a burger and ordering a plate of the duck ravioli; absolutely excellent! 
Next time we have a night out for a date, we'll be going back to the Nash for sure!
Thanks for a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"Arrived at the Nash for a pre-flames meal. The restaurant itself is beautiful and I recognized some staff from Notable in Montgomery.  Atmosphere looks promising as well.  The service was friendly and attentive. Found the appetizers on the menu pretty boring to be honest. They are not afraid to charge at The Nash.  Ordered the dungeoness crab to share - they brought it out with 3 tiny bread/crackers - what is 3/2? Bad start. Ordered the smoked porkchop from the firepit - this was very good. Then the cash grab dessert menu came out. Ordered a $12 Apple Pie and what arrived looked like someone dropped a piece of pie on the counter and scraped up half of it for presentation. This is not an apple pie and they should warn your mind's eye when you order it. That was a big disappointment. Dessert menu is boring and over priced. Overall the meal was satisfactory - kick up the menu folks.  I would suggest SUGO rather than the Nash based on value for money and the overall quality of food in Inglewood.  And this place has miles to go to match the expectations Notables has created. The dessert here really was a poor ending for a $200 meal."}
{"text":"After a shakey start, the Nash has come into it's own as an Inglewood establishment for good food and great cocktails!  Never a cheap night, but always enjoyable, it has become one of our regular haunts.  They've demonstrated an ability to keep their quality staff over the years which always bodes well for a business and makes it a friendly place to visit."}
{"text":"Tastefully creatively crafted offerings here.  Service was excellent , price point right on Parr for what you getting here. Great  spot."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and great server, but... Quite disappointed with my meal.  I had huge expectations after having dined at Notables on a number of occasions, but Nash missed the mark in my books.  Beef tartare was overly salty, my scallop and pork belly main had all of one scallop, and the desert menu was so underwhelming, we actually went to Dairy Queen and ordered blizzards.  My two dinner companions each ordered the burger, and both said it was nowhere close to being one of the better burgers they've had in the past.  With respect to desert, Our server did tell us a new desert menu was coming the next day, so hopefully they have replaced the numerous dark chocolate options with some more variety."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, and great service. A fantastic addition to Inglewood.

My wife and I went to The Nash to top off our Christmas date, and we are very glad we did. The Nash was the perfect way to top off an already stellar day.

The wait: There was none. We went on the Sunday before Christmas holidays and booked 3 days before. While the restaurant was full, I suspect a table for two wouldn't have had to wait for long to be seated even if they didn't have reservations. According to our waitress, Fridays and Saturdays are gongshows, so plan accordingly!

The service: no problems here. Our waitress came promptly after we were seated to take our drink orders. What was kind of weird was we had to ask for the full drink menu from Off Cut Bar, but our waitress grabbed the menu right away and was quite knowledgeable about the drinks. I went with a staple Village Blonde, but there are a variety of interesting sounding historical Calgary-inspired cocktails available that I will be sure to try on my next visit.

The food: As we weren't extremely hungry, we skipped the appies and ordered the Sunrise Co-Op Free Run Half Chicken and Seared East Coast Scallops. Both were AMAZING. If you've been to NOtaBLE, you will be familiar with the chicken. It's a perfectly roasted, rich tasting bird that strikes a good balance between the seasoning and natural flavours of the chicken. It's not going to win any awards for creativity, but there's something to be said about great execution.

I'm not sure why the Seared East Coast Scallops was given that name. I felt the star of the dish was the pork belly and delicious crispy proscuitto that comes with the dish. The pork belly was a tender, melt-in-your mouth affair that warms the soul on a cold December day, and the proscuitto provided a nice contrast in texture to the softness of the pork belly. There were also scallops. They were tasty.

The price: I would say The Nash is on the pricier side; definitely more expensive than the fare at NOtaBLE. However, I feel this is justified by the fact that the dishes are more inventive and novel.

All in all, we had a resoundingly positive experience at The Nash and look forward to a second visit in the near future. Definitely give this new gem a try!"}
{"text":"While the food was very good, it could hardly make up for the absolutely poor service. When we left we actually remarked to one another that the only friendly staff member we encountered was a bearded bartender.  Upon arriving and requesting a table for two we were told 45 minutes and to take a seat in the bar.  After an hour I checked back in with the hostess and she advised it would be at least another 30 minutes. It was almost 2 hours before we were seated. As a well dressed polite couple in our early 30's I have not felt so discriminated since I was in my early 20's looking for a new car at a dealership where everyone scoffs you off and could care less about you. Staff need to refocus on service and stop acting above the patrons because they work at a nice restaurant with a great chef and food."}
{"text":"We went to the Nash for our anniversary dinner, and we really wanted to love it since we are such big fans of Notable. The decor of the restaurant is quite beautiful- but the menu was very limited. My husband and I prefer to order lots of small dishes and enjoy sampling everything a restaurant has to offer, and found this quite difficult at the Nash. The appetizers are not meant to be shared, and we found very few options on how to order other than to eat an appetizer each, then order an entree each. Our waitress was professional, but seemed rushed to ask us what we wanted to drink, instead of greeting us and asking why we came in etc. We find at Notable the staff are always eager to socialize with us, and when they find out its a birthday/anniversary, find a way to make your evening special. We didn't get the sense at the Nash that they cared- perhaps they have been so busy since opening that they don't need to focus on the the little things that make all the difference. All in all - we won't be returning, not because the restaurant isn't nice, but because we find other places in town to be much more flexible for our dining style."}
{"text":"My friend and I ate here on Saturday evening at 5PM, so we figured it wouldn't be too busy, and it wasn't.  There was room in the lounge on some uncomfortable stools at the community table.  The service was mediocre, and our server was not that cheery although the another server attending to tables near the window seemed more friendlier with an inviting warm smile.  My friend and I both ordered the Nash Cheeseburger.  It was a mix of beef and pork, and I have to say it was very disappointing.  The burger was much smaller than the size of the bun, the burger slid around in the bun, and the bacon was a tough chew.  We both left a quarter of the bun on the plate, stating the same reason.  As for the fries, they were good, although we had to remind the server for ketchup.  I would recommend going elsewhere for burgers, plus this place reeks of pretentious people."}
{"text":"Go to The Nash if you'd like a restaurant with unique decor, a relaxing atmosphere and food that is to die for.

We celebrated our 8 year anniversary here! I had the rotisserie pork served with rose sauce, couscous, broccolini. He had the 4K farms tamworth pork tenderloin served with a souffle. We both ended the night with the Last Best Brewing Porter Cake!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and great food. Lamb was delicious and root beer float desert was one of my favourite in the city. 

Definitely a must try."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great, the servicing is fantastic and the food is absolutely amazing! We sat at the kitchen bar and loved to watch as the chef's created and plated absolute masterpiece food!

Would absolutely recommend for anyone looking for a delicious meal in a fantastic atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Excellent stop in for lunch after the lunch hour.
Lamb Tag was absolutely delicious, complimented with a nice pinot grigio.
Very quiet, and enjoyable, the server is wonderful, she is perfect.

And now to enjoy a pressed decaf. Coffee

Cheers"}
{"text":"Well, I'll start with the positives.¬† The place looks great.¬† It is well spaced out and the decor is interesting, without being distracting.¬† The food was tasty, though pricey. Our meal for 6 people was $400, which included wine and 2 appetizers.

Here is the down-side, and it's a big one.¬† Someone in my party ordered the rotisserie chicken, which apparently tasted great. However, this person became violently ill later that night (symptoms started about 6 hrs after eating). I will spare you some of the details, but after having passed out, an ambulance was needed to take a trip to the hospital.¬† The paramedics and the doctor in the ER all suggested that it was most likely a result of the chicken dinner from The Nash, as the incident occurred within the suggested time guidelines for salmonella food poisoning (6-72 hrs after ingestion).¬† They also noted that it was the only different meal the ill person had eaten within the previous 3 days and no one else was sick.

I understand these things happen sometimes, in spite of any food safety precautions being taken. Although it is impossible to say for certain that the illness was from the chicken at The Nash, it is the most likely the scenario according to medical professionals. The next day we contacted The Nash after to let them know what happened, in case there were other cases or perhaps they like to keep track of these things. The 2 times we phoned no one answered so we emailed the guest relations staff member listed on their website. They did not respond for 4 days but when we finally got a hold of the manager on the phone he was familiar with our email, showing that they read it but chose not to respond. 30 mins after the phone call they did respond to the email where they essentially told us no comment and directed us to call Alberta Health Services. We specifically said in our email (and on the phone) that we don't want anything.¬† We didn't even expect a complimentary meal. We asked for nothing.

They referred us to a health inspector, even though we never mentioned a desire to report this incident to AHS. When the person who was ill was contacted by AHS they ended the conversation feeling as though the only goal of the inspector was to convince her that the food poisoning could not possibly have come from The Nash, as they haven't had problems before. Does that mean they can't ever have problems? They even asked if we'd been cleaning any out any RV sewage containers lately, which no, we don't have an RV.  Even though several different medical professionals gave the opinion that the chicken was the most likely and reasonable cause, the health inspector was very aggressive about why that couldn't be possible. We'll stick with what actual medical professionals told us.¬† We weren't trying to report The Nash and it was not our motivation to bring it to a health inspector and to be honest I wouldn't bother reporting anything to a health inspector again after this experience with them. We just wanted to keep The Nash informed, in case they actually cared about customers' dining experiences. That was our mistake, though, as I certainly don't feel like they care about our well-being. They have not contacted us since, even though they said they would if we called AHS.

So...advice to The Nash: ¬†Just say, \"Sorry to hear.¬† Thanks for letting us know.¬† We will look into it.\" ¬†If they'd done that, we would have said, \"You're welcome.\" ¬†and that would have been the end of it. ¬† In the end, they showed essentially zero empathy and demonstrated a level of customer service that I consider below a typical fast food chain restaurant.¬† They were rude, pretentious, defensive, and no one from our party will ever go back. I advise you to not go here either if those things are important to you."}
{"text":"One of my favorites in Calgary! Urban elite atmosphere and killer food and cocktails."}
{"text":"The food was delicious here, but the service was terrible. There was a party of 9 of us and because of the guaranteed gratuity the server checked in on us twice the whole 4 hours we were there and one of those times was to take our order. We waited just over an hour for our food (I understand that good food takes time but when your server won't give you the time of day to take drink or appy orders or even fill your water, 1 hour can feel like 3 when you're hangry). Won't be back here anytime soon. A waste of good food and good decor on an establishment with awful service."}
{"text":"Top shelf, one of the best food offerings in Calgary!

We've been coming here since opening night and have yet to be disappointed. 

We had a brilliant dinner experience this week. It started with amazing service: our server Nicki was attentive but unobtrusive, professional but friendly. She ensured the experience was excellent.

Not to be outdone, Chef Matthew Batey's menu offerings were flawless. Prime rib, chicken, and ling cod - all exquisite. Served quickly after we had polished off the tuna and white bean appetizers. The prime rib was the wood grill special and it was great - invariably the wood grill specials are awesome. Also, the chicken has a great reputation - you can take out whole chickens. 

Don't forget your gluten: daily breads are always unique and tasty. And the desserts were really nice: the banana fritters were tops!

Thank you Chef Matthew. Thank you Nicki. Thank you The Nash"}
{"text":"I went to the Nash for dinner with my boyfriend. It was a Wednesday night and we didn't think to make reservations, however the place was pretty full but we didn't have to wait for a table. I ordered the Arctic char, my boyfriend got the duck breast, and we shared a unique mango dessert. We had excellent, friendly service from Bjorn. We both enjoyed our specular meals, especially the duck, the cherry sauce that came with the place was so delicious we both wanted to slurp it up with a spoon! Our dessert was amazing, nothing like I've ever seen before; a mix of spicy and sweet! It was infused greens, fluffy cake with wasabi icing, black sesame crackers and the best mango sorbet I've ever tasted! I am very happy with the food, service, ambiance and location of this place and would recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"I'm disappointed.  We live a short walk away, and have been waiting anxiously for The Nash to open, so of course we went on their first night of service (Thursday, November 20th I believe?) but we were not impressed.  

We made a reservation for 6:30 and arrived a bit early, but was seated immediately which was nice.  We could definitely see that the server was frazzled, but she was still very pleasant when she finally got around to us about 15 minutes after we sat down.  By then of course we were ready to order and put that through right away.  The appies and meals came in a reasonable amount of time, which was a bonus given how slow the rest of the night was.  My fish dish was EXTREMELY salty.  Like almost inedible.  My husband's beef was just okay.  It took our server way too long to get back around to us, to refill our water, to ask how our meal was, to bring the dessert menu, to bring our bill.  

We don't mind paying the prices listed for good food, but unfortunately we did not find the value here. 

We plan to give them a couple more months to get over their growing pains, and try it again.  I hope we can give them a better rating next time!"}
{"text":"Food was good, but service today was surprisingly poor. We came with a group of 10 for a birthday party at the large table. Our server was Ashley and from the very beginning something just didn't feel right. She wasn't very friendly, and she didn't attempt to make our dinner especially enjoyable. Not sure if maybe she was having a bad day, or didn't want to put too much effort because the gratuity was guaranteed for her but we definitely noticed. We are all in our early 20's and at times maybe loud, but not rude or obnoxious. 

I was here yesterday too for dinner with my parents and our server yesterday was exceptional! I was kind of surprised with the service today. 

In terms of food, the poutine was really good, the salmon chowder and the first dessert on the menu were great. I tried the family style meal and though it was a good deal I wasn't loving the bison."}
{"text":"Stellar service and excellent food. The Nash is one of my new favourite restaurants in Town! We have food allergies which the server did not hesitate to accommodate."}
{"text":"It was not the best experience at the Nash but also not the worst. We were freezing our butts off seated by the window, we mentioned this to our waiter who said he would turn up the heat but this did not change anything. The appetizers and drinks were actually the better part of the meal, we ordered the crispy potato rolls and beef tartare, both delicious. We ordered ceasers for our cocktails, also delightful! 

The waiter informed us of their features at the start of our visit. The main feature was an Arctic char with a side of asparagus filleted at the table. 

My partner ordered this feature meal but was extremely disappointed. The char was soggy, tasteless and already filleted when it arrived at our table. The skin was missing from the top, which the waiter attributed to sticking on the grill. Instead of asparagus we received green beans. In addition, the waiter punched in the wrong feature so we had to wait an additional amount of time before receiving our meals, during this time my order was sitting out getting cold. I ordered the duck breast which would have been delicious if it wasn't cold. The gnocchi and berry sauce were amazing though! We also ordered a side of scallops which were great. 

The waiter did remove the char from the bill, but the experience was affected regardless. Don't know if I would go back."}
{"text":"I heard lots of great things about The Nash and it didn't disappoint! I love Notable but knew The Nash was a different menu and vibe in Inglewood! So glad that we finally had a chance to try it out. Worth the wait. 

We came by on Thursday night around 8:30pm for a later dinner. The restaurant was still quite full and very lively. This was a bit surprising since the weather was horrible. Now I know everyone was hiding inside eating! 

Service was top notch and wouldn't expect anything less from the hostess and servers at this establishment. Not one negative or anything to complain about. 
 
We ordered a couple drinks, their signature burger and duck ravioli for dinner.  I sampled both dinners and they were both delicious. I wish there was left overs of the ravioli to take home but we devoured it. 

Fantastic food, excellent service and a great atmosphere.  5+ stars. I will come back to try out the brunch one weekend, since I hear so much about it. Thanks The Nash!"}
{"text":"The short version: Our experience at this restaurant was an exceptionally long wait topped by a mediocre meal.

The long version: 
We were excited to have reservations at this place, with its buzz and pedigree.   We arrived at 8:45 for a 9pm reservation.  They had already bumped our reservation to 9:30...  A little irksome, but we figured it gave us a good excuse for a cocktail at the adjacent bar.   Stood at the bar for about fifteen minutes watching the two tenders smiling and shaking their.... Um.... Shakers lots for show, but not moving very fast and falling further and further behind on orders from the restaurant, while not servicing the bar itself at all.  

Finally gave up on bar service entirely when one of our party found a table in the bar which promised table service.  The very sweet server was completely overwhelmed, confused and stressed - but eventually made it to us to take our drink order.  I ordered a gin martini, a little dirty....  And got a lemon-infused vodka martini with olives in it.   The receipt showed \"tar benders special\".   Whatever, I was thirsty.... No complaints, and was just happy to get a drink... By this time it's 9:30 or so, 45 mins in.   And we figure we'll be seated in the restaurant soon.   We check in with the hostess, and she says soon... She'll come get us in the bar.

Getting close to 10, still nothing, drinks long gone, we order a bottle of wine.  Wine menu is OK.  No particular specialty, pretty short list for a restaurant catering to foodies.  Sommelier came by to make a recommendation, was very nice.

10:15 still don't have a table for us.  Our server nicely comps us a cheese plate which was lovely and staved off full hangry mode.

10:30 we check in with the hostess again and it turns out they now thought they already seated us.... Had our name crossed off the list.  

10:40 finally we get seated in restaurant.  As we are walking through the restaurant I see only two tables with food on them... Not hopeful.   New server was also very pleasant.   We had the menus memorized by this time so we ordered right away.   They were out of a number of things on the menu. I was hoping for the Elk Ossobuco - they were out of the elk, but were making the dish with Bison.  Still sounded good, so I rolled with it.   

Meal actually arrived pretty quickly, by this time the restaurant was clearing out, was close to 11.  Presentation was sub par... Huge pile of brown meat, no garnish, a small blob of hidden cooked greens, and blob on either side of a tablespoon or so of risotto.   Meat was nicely cooked, tender and falling off the bone.  Seasoning was pretty uninspired... Bland.  The sauce under the risotto tasted like off the shelf barbecue sauce.   Overall the food was fine, but not what I would expect from a place with this much hype, and certainly not worth an hour and a half wait past our reservation time.

I hope they work out the kinks in this place.   Ambiance is good, servers friendly, and it has potential.  But right now the management needs to get their act together and the food needs to be taken up a notch for it to get return business once the newness fizzles out."}
{"text":"Review based on lunch.
Lunch menu limited however a good variety for all tastes.
I had the beef brisket and was very tatsy. 5 yelp
Soup of the day was corn chorizo 4 yelp.
Service  4 yelp
Decor 4 yelp i got very hot as my back was to the window and a very sunny day.
Upscale and a upscale price."}
{"text":"Conceited staff with no motivation to provide customer service is when they are already granted an 18% gratuity"}
{"text":"We decided to check out The Nash for Saturday brunch. Oh my.. this space is really nice. So sunny and bright with ultra cool natural furnishing. Very beautiful.

We started with carrot ginger soup. Amazing! I loved that they were served in small individual soup terrines. Really cute and very delicious. The bread of the day was toothsome and steaming hot fresh. Because we were sharing with the table, I wasn't that keen on tearing off a chunk as no bread knife was presented, nor was it sliced. Awkward!!

For a main, I chose the double smoked bacon and free range eggs, served with a lovely little rosti potato patty. The rosti was so crispy on the outside, with a soft and creamy inside. The bacon was absolutely wonderful, it was thick and tasted of a lightly smoked pork roast. Very delicious. My eggs, however, had to be sent back. Perhaps I don't understand what 'medium' basted means but I don't believe the yolks should be completely hard. Sadly, I was nearly finished eating the rest of my food by the time they returned, about 15 minutes later, with my new eggs. 

The guys had Nash Burgers. They were large and juicy served on a fresh baked brioche bun, lightly toasted. Just perfect. I would expect nothing less in a burger from the Noble crew. 

Overall, we enjoyed the food and the service with only the few hiccups mentioned. Will definitely be back for another round!!"}
{"text":"Where to start... the ambience is like hipster meets posh and go in a date to ... Edmonton?!?!? One good thing though, the volume of the top40 radio station is low enough so you can have a decent conversation. There's a wood oven right in the middle of the room so the place can get really dry. Bring some moisturizer. 


We shared the family dinner menu on a Sunday night for almost $40/person. The salad came before the soup, and everything was pre-made so it took away the sense of \"freshness\". Flavours were ok and service was oddly fast. I wouldn't pick the family menu again."}
{"text":"Excellent brunch service! The servers are friendly and helpful and always make sure your drinks are full. I had the traditional breakfast and shared a cinnamon bun. Everything was excellent but prepare yourself for a rich flavour experience as the potatoes are cooked in duck fat! 

I could go again just for a cinnamon bun and a side of bacon and be happy for the day :).

Also to note, they are one of the only brunch places that takes reservations which I love! No more standing on the sidewalk for an hour hungry and hungover!"}
{"text":"Went back again for brunch on Sunday as my hubby and I were craving the hangover pizza.  Unfortunately they changed it and it paled in comparison.  What a disappointment!  The new one was a Mexican spin?! Mush mush mush.  The pizza crust was topped with bean curd (mush)' then a salt sausage salsa (more mush) and cheese and two eggs.  Needless to say, we did not finish anything but the eggs and the side of double smoked bacon which was yum.  Upon our early departure I asked it there was a \"to go\" option for the rest of my coffee.  There was not but suggest an option to have in future as the coffee is too good to waste.  Overall, I do not plan to return for brunch anytime soon and hope that the original hangover pizza returns...."}
{"text":"I'm all for an experimental menu but if the food doesn't deliver its really just alot of wank. My husband and I love trying new flavors so I was really looking forward to Nash, sadly I was heavily disappointed.

Our server was helpful and the atmosphere and interior of the restaurant is great, but that is where my enjoyment ended. Upon reading over the cocktail menu I was immediately put off, I love my food, I love my cocktails but COME ON! not one cocktails had a list of ingredients which flavors I knew well enough to know if they would go well together. It was the by far the most pretentious cocktail menu I have ever read. You would have had to have been a bartender to know even half of the cocktail menu ingredients (and this was agreed upon with the other 6 friends at our table - so it wasn't just us!), so anyway I bypassed the cocktail menu and went for wine, which was great. Like I said I love my cocktails, but this was list was laughable.

Wait Time: My husbands beer took over 20 mins to arrive, also our food took almost 45 mins but that may have been because we were a table of 8.

Food menu, we were quite shocked at the prices to begin with. It was really expensive but if the food delivers than I'll happily pay.  Sadly my food was good but nothing to rave about (considering how much it was). My husband ordered the pork belly and scallops and I ordered the chicken. My chicken came with a pea risotto and I didn't even eat the risotto as it was way too heavy on the peas. The smoked flavor was really good though, not amazing but good. We did order the side of the wild mushroom risotto and that was really good but again for the price, I'm expecting GREAT. My husbands pork belly was really tasty, but he was still hungry once he was done, this was after a bread starter and a beer, really disappointing. The sourdough bread that we had for a starter was great as well. One other couple at our table wanted to order it as well and sadly they only had one loaf left so we all shared - again something that shouldn't happen if you're charging what Nash is charging. 

So with the over pretentious cocktail menu and the lack of deliverance on the actual taste of the food, I sadly give Nash 2 star. I was disappointed."}
{"text":"The Nash is a SMASH Hit!!!
Try the lounge, try the restaurant but just come here!!! This old historic bldg in Inglewood has turned into a trendy upscale foodie paradise! 
All 4 of us in our party agreed that every dish, every ingredient, every carefully placed herb & spice perfectly complimented each plate. 

We started with the Crispy Potato Rolls (pulled pork, pepper jack, Sriracha, salsa verde) which looked like little spring rolls. They were served with what we would refer to as a \"Siracha Mayonnaise\". The Beetroot Salad was delicious and had an unexpected treat in the middle...beet sorbet!

Our server was able to discuss the menu with ease. She answered our questions and made suggestions based on our preferences. She also advised us to order two sides to share \"family style\". We chose the vegetable which was cabbage and the today's risotto which had ch√™vre & tomatoes.

The entrees we decided upon were the Hardwood Grilled Plank Salmon, pan Seared Ling Cod, Tamworth Pork Tenderloin, Almond and Leek Ash Crust and Basil, Chicken & Roasted Squash Rigatoni. Each dish came with perfect accompaniments to allow each mouthful to be absolute heaven for your senses!

We were pretty full by dessert so just had coffees and tried the Roasted Banana Doughnuts. What a treat! A Perfect End to a perfect meal. 
Thank you Chef Michael Noble and all your hard working staff!

Our SERVER SPLIT OUR BILL PERFECTLY 4 WAYS AND TOTALLED WHAT EACH ONE OF US OWED, WITHOUT EVEN HAVING TO ASK, IMPRESSIVE!!!"}
{"text":"Loved the decor and the heritage/history of this building. Came here for a family dinner and the place was packed on a Friday night.

The menu features a wide variety of items including meats and seafood. Things are freshly made with a Canadian focus. Loved the starters - great for sharing. The pumpkin risotto is awesome. Super creamy and cheesy... strangely not much of a pumpkin taste though! The broccolini + bacon was also delicious! The squid and chickpea dish was interesting but was better on the menu than in real life. The roasted squash with spinach was a nice mix of textures - maybe a bit too spinachy. The mains were also solid - it's great that they de-bone the fish for you as it does come whole. Interesting way of cooking their fish in a rotisserie oven. My flatiron steak was okay - good but not memorable.

Overall a solid 4 stars for a nice dinner out.

(This place needs more bathrooms though!)"}
{"text":"Wow ! What a nice place. Very cute setup. Randie our waiter was amazing. 
We went for the beet salad which was great with local food (cheese from BC but it's Canadian so I'll consider it local, our stuff is awesome)
Then the duck breast with the gnocchi. It probably was the third best duck I've had (first being in Bordeau France so that says a lot) and the best gnocchi ever ! It was like eating a fluffy cloud. Light and soft. 
And the chocolate bar for dessert. All that with a nice bottle of Okanagan Sancerre.  Amazing menu. Not to be missed if you visit Calgary"}
{"text":"Amazing, just amazing! 
Service was top notch, food was excellent and I cannot wait to go back! Went for brunch two Sundays ago( first visit to the nash) we initially went in with low expectations but we were blown away. 

We ordered the hangover breakfast pizza, the banana bread french toast, duck confit  perogies and the must have cinnamon bun. I had to stop myself from doing my happy food dance while eating. Everything was well seasoned the breakfast pizza was better than what we had imagined. Delicious, I didn't need to bring out my hotsauce at all. I've never had merguez sausage and my god it was heavenly. 

The desert was awesome too, I definitely  recommend the banana bread french toast. The server was really sweet, a bit shocked that two people could eat so much lol. Can't wait to try the dinner menu or even the Sunday family style dinners they have."}
{"text":"Tonight I attended the opening of The Nash in Calgary's Inglewood community.
Located in the historic former National Hotel, Chef Michael Noble, from NOtaBLE fame, has opened his (quote) \"Last Restaurant\" and it is impressive!

The food is exactly what you would expect from a former Iron Chef competitor while the design and atmosphere are like no other in the city.

On one side, a delicate dinning room which serves everything from Brisket to Lamb. 

And on the other side; Off Cut Bar. 
A moody open concept speakeasy which serves some of the most creative cocktails you've ever tasted

The Nash is open for dining until 10pm and Off Cut Bar will welcome patrons for lite bites and savory sips until Midnight.

This Resturant and Bar will change the face of this sleepy community!"}
{"text":"Hmmmm so it seems my review got moved over. Oh well! Gives me another excuse to review the Nash!

I had a more complete experience the second time around. We strolled in on a late saturday night and they took us in with no reservations (I called a few days ago and the Nash was fully booked). But here's a Lifehack: take your chances at the off cut bar.

We ordered several dishes and nobody got time to be reviewing everyone so I'll give props for two things I still can't stop raving about. 

1. THeir octopus salad. Perfectly seasoned and cooked to the right texture. If it was any less seasoned, the slightly toughness made eating the octopus a chore. BUT, this was a amazing umame experience you didn't want to end or at least savour, like a perfect date with a 10. 

2. Beetroot sponge cake. SO interesting. I've never enjoyed anything this savoury and salty as a desert in my life. Worth taking a chance on, trust me.

The consolation prize goes to their burger, which really is built for one big mouth to tackle, rather than two cocktail-drunk chatty ones."}
{"text":"A week before my Calgary business trip, Gayle asked me why she wasn't coming along.  She had just retired after 18 extraordinary years at the City of Walnut Creek, and was still adjusting to her new \"schedule\".  My response was that I invited her a few months before, and she turned me down.  I guess Calgary in January wasn't very appealing at the time. 

The Nash is a classy place, that I will take my classy wife to lunch or dinner the next time we're in town.  I saw the Nash name in one of the City's free magazines in an article featuring the founder of the nearby Espy Experience who was singing its praises in particular, and the Inglewood neighbourhood in general.  So one early morning, I took a walk from my Hilton Garden Inn \"residence\" and saw Inglewood (and the Nash building myself).  My local friend Jim told me later that the refurbishment of this distinctive historical building into the Nash was long in coming and almost brick-by-brick. 

I came here last Friday from Lunch and dined at the counter of the Off Cut Bar.  The Bar area is a very nice space, well arranged, handsomely appointed, and with big front windows letting in the light.  I understand that there's music here on Thursday evenings? Space-wise, the Off Cut Bar is off to the side as you walk in. Onward is a huge and spacious dining area, with table cloths, and well-dressed and attentive staff.  Gayle's kind of place. 

On this relatively cold and sunny day, I ordered one of my Midwest favorites: a grilled cheese sandwich and tomato soup/bisque combination, along with a pint of a local red ale. Delicious.  Great bar keep service too.  I also dined more slowly than usual as I wanted to linger and enjoy the experience as much as possible.  It was kind of like a Torah service: you get there quickly and leave slowly. 

Who knows if or when Gayle and I will be back in Calgary and what other unexplored culinary outposts await.  But for sure, the Nash will be on my short list."}
{"text":"Great spot. The design draws you in immediately. Vintage tile floor in the entrance; lounge on the right and open plan restaurant straight ahead. The food is very high quality and creative. The wine list is more than adequate with lots of choices in the sweet spot 40-80. Great service. Very energetic, maybe a little noisy for us middle agers. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The Nash might be pricey but it is worth every bite.   The portions are what they should be.   You feel satisfIed.   Not like generic family resuraunts.  The atmosphere is amazing.   The food is amazing.   Bravo!"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of hanging out in the Off Cut Bar at the Nash. Located in Inglewood (recently named Canada's greatest neighborhood in the Great Places competition), there's an awesome vibe as you walk into the bar - it's comfortable, yet edgy.

The space is roomy, yet cozy with lots of room to sit or stand (I was at an event that had me mostly standing, but I was completely fine with this). The bar is the perfect place to mingle and nibble on fanastically prepared & presented charcuterie plates. The meats, cheeses, olives, breads, and crackers were extremely fresh and delicious.

The actual bar (where drinks are made) is along one wall, and there are windows opposite the bar looking out onto the street. So, you don't get a closed in feeling, but it actually feels quite spacious.

The location was once the National Hotel and boasted a speakeasy style bar popular with an eclectic mix of shady patrons. (You can see some of their pics on the wall).

This was an evening event and I loved how the lighting stayed low even once it was dark outside the windows. It was such a relaxing atmosphere, and as I sipped my wine and looked around, I made a plan to visit the Off Cut Bar again soon."}
{"text":"I booked his restaurant for my birthday from OpenTable. about a week after I booked, I got a call from this restaurant and was told they wouldn't open  on the day. They asked me if I want to book for another day.

I just lost a week to find other nice restaurants while they were figuring out if they open or not. I believe they could have called me a way earlier than that if they care.

When I went back to OpenTable, they were still taking reservation for the day. 

I'm just guessing that they just happened to get a big private reservation on the day, so they decided to cancel all other small reservations or they did not get enough reservations worth to open the restaurant on the day.

I will not try again because i don't want to get it cancelled a week after, no matter how good they are.

I don't know and I don't care how their food taste like anymore.

Simply, disappointing with the service.

Bye,"}
{"text":"The food was exceptional. Presentation and taste were excellent. Service was very good. Our server was terrific at recommending which dishes she thought would suit our needs. It is on the pricier side but you get generous portions. So if you are looking for a fancier place to wine and dine, this is a good option."}
{"text":"No question-its a 5. Its a bit spendy so I really enjoy it if someone else is paying. heehee. I however unequivocally enjoyed the last dinner I had there - even though I paid. 
We had a table for 4 of us. Decor is so lovely in the old dirtball National Hotel. The Nash is shabby chic and elegant and sweet and beautiful.  We had the potato rolls which were ridiculous. Like all 4 of us stopped talking and we laughed at how we were all speechless. And we had the daily bread which wad also delicious. My hubs and friend ordered the special which was the Prime Rib special. I almost had food envy except for the BC Salmon that I ordered and was also delicious. We shared a bottle of wine after very unique cocktails. I had a kind of Tom Collins which was delicious and unique. Wine was lovely and the fellas had a twist on an Old Fashion. Dinner we finished with a lemon tart and a chocolate flourless cake. Perfect ending to one of the best meals I have had in a long long time. Go there. Its worth it."}
{"text":"The Offcut bar is one of my favorite places to enjoy chocolate mouse and port while enjoying friends in an cozy/upscale atmosphere.    Service is always great!"}
{"text":"Came here the last Friday working of the Christmas season.  After driving around for 20 minutes to find parking....Was really excited to come try as I'm a huge fan of notable.  Was looking forward to the new chef and seeing the Nash re-done. It was a Santa Monica look meets Calgary. A bit strange but open and refreshing look, just weird for something that could have been created that was really neat.  They  kept more of the historic look.   I laughed that you saw the happy chicken right away.  Then looking at the limited menu it had a few of the notable dishes...not something fresh and new?  Why again is what I'd think? My friend had been here 4 times and said it was pretty good but declined everytime she was there and was sad she had already eaten most things on the menu since it was so limited.  She ordered the fish and said it was brutal.  I ordered the pasta. It was not good.  I left half.  We saw the waitress to order wine and lunch and she didn't come back.  3 of the wines I ordered didn't come in...??? How does this happen?? she gave me one that wasn't my preference and was not very good.you think someone would have checked in on that and the meal.  She didn't. Then someone came and cleared.  Food had trouble meeting mediocre.  We saw chef noble over looking.  If he had come by we were going to say what happened?!?! Notable is amazing.  The waitress returned and suggested we try the apple tart.  It was awful.  I would not recommend it to anyone.  
So sadly, I have to post this."}
{"text":"Went for brunch. Great rotisserie chicken salad. Chicken and waffles were a 7/10. Nice space and Solid service. I would go back For dinner in future."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try The Nash for a very long time and got my chance today for Sunday brunch. The decor was great and ambience was nice. Wasn't too loud that we had to shout to talk to each other. 

We were a party of 4 and had reservations for 1pm. We arrived about 15mins early. Table was ready yet, no sweat, we chatted and patiently waited. Twenty minutes after 1pm we finally get seated. Close to 30mins after being seated, our server comes for a drink order. Not a good first impression. The restaurant was busy but there was more than enough staff working. Anyways by this time we order our food along with drinks as we are getting hangry. We ordered smoked salmon eggs benedict, hangover breakfast pizza, the Nash breakfast(traditional bacon and eggs), and mussels and frites. We wanted the Nash cinnamon bun but they were sold out by the time we got seated. 

It was close to an hour and a half before our food came. Some tables that were seated after us received their food before us. The food itself was just mediocre, and we were HUNGRY. When you're as hungry as we were, a saltine taste amazing. Definitely not worth the long wait. To make matters worse, they charge for still water. WHO charges for tap water??

I want to try their regular menu; however after this experience I'm not sure if I want to anymore."}
{"text":"Fantastic all around service. The food, atmosphere, bartender, thoughtfully curated wine list. Dining at The Nash was very encouraging for this former SF-based patron. I would recommend this establishment to anyone that loves checking out farm to table restaurants. Well done!"}
{"text":"Huge shout out to Niki S ... food here is always excellent and pairing it with the best service is magic. Thank you Niki for making our meal tonight just that extra special with your suggestions, warm nature and all around great energy!! If Bison is served when you come, it's a must. Chicken is the best chicken if you're going to order chicken at a restaurant. My fianc√© and I love this place. It's worth it if you've never been. You'll leave satisfied, happy and inspired. Sitting at the bar by the grill is very cool and entertaining!!!"}
{"text":"We had a great early (13th) valentines dinner out at the Nash this evening.  For a busy night the service was good (we had some slow service at the beginning but it was noticed immediately and another server came over and helped out).  Appetizers and drinks came out in a reasonable amount of time and were good.  The Ham hock & foie gras tureen was stellar, the house bread was fine but definitely not worth 8 dollar price tag (especially since most restaurants of this level that would be automatically included).  Our entree's were on the table moments after our appie dishes were cleared away and were very good.  Both the Bison Short Rib and Scallop and pork belly were good portion sizes, hot and very well prepared.  We're looking forward to our next trip down to Inglewood to enjoy The Nash."}
{"text":"We finally went to the Nash last night. Had an amazing meal, my wife had the pork tenderloin and I had the ribeye. Everything was fantastic and the service was the best I can remember having in Calgary. We'll definitely be back again, desserts were also fantastic."}
{"text":"This was probably one of the best restaurants I've been to in a long time- now one of my favourites! From the modern & chique decor the moment you enter the restaurant, to the delicate use of flavours and elegant plating with the food- the restaurant doesn't disappoint. Service was top notch and they were quick to accommodate for food sensitivities. Exceptional restaurant- can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"The Nash - I hadn't even heard of this restaurant until a friend suggested it for dinner. This was definitely a cool, upscale experience. The ambiance and decor were very tasteful and thematically appropriate - everything matched from the wall art to the decor style to the tables. 

The menu is fairly small, which is a great thing for a restaurant like this - it makes me believe that it's carefully thought out and menu choices are meaningful. It's definitely an upscale dining experience with the associated price tag - but in my opinion, it's worth it. 

We started with the steak tartare and duck confit ravioli - the tartare was fresh, seasoned well, and served with pickled vegetables and chips. I would not have minded a more bread-y substitute to the chips. The duck confit ravioli was creamy and definitely delicious, with the exception of the fact I felt it was oversalted (unfortunately a bit of a theme throughout the night, and this is coming from a guy who usually prefers a bit of oversalting). 

For our mains, I got the lamb sirloin and my friend got the 12 oz ribeye. The ribeye came with a veggie mix and blue cheese gnocchi - while I love gnocchi, I found these pieces to be a bit too large with not enough texture (or mouthfeel) and again, oversalted. The steak was pretty good, but for $57 I would expect something a little bit more mindblowing. 

The lamb however, was indeed outstanding. It was cooked to perfection with a fantastic palette of seasoning and appropriate flavours. 

The dining experience as a whole was really positive - I loved the atmosphere and the food is very good. While I would definitely come back, I feel that for this price range there are other excellent establishments in Calgary I'd like to make a second visit to before this one."}
{"text":"Have been waiting to try this place out and Friday we had a guys day out so started here. 6 of us for lunch, 4 burgers, 1 salmon and 1 reuben. Burger was excellent with a piece if bacon that is more like pork belly, the others all loved their food as well. Tasty local beers on tap. A bit on the expensive side but we all enjoyed it. 

Great service also!"}
{"text":"Came for opening night and came back another day for lunch in December. Service was great, we didn't make a reso for lunch but were given a few options since it was full. Ended up getting in right away and sat down for lunch. 

My lunch date and I both ordered the pulled rotisserie chicken sandwich. She had hers with fries and I had salad. While the salad was good I was in a fry mood lol and her's were fabulous!! Next time it's fries for me! The sandwiches were tasty, the restaurant gorgeous.

Looking forward to bringing my husband along next time!"}
{"text":"This place has opened up in Nov 2014, still brand new, and hasn't completely found itself. However, the service was impeccable and the environment was quite unique. Some items on the menu we tried were quite small portions, so you might want to check that before you order!"}
{"text":"Heard lots of great things about The Nash and glad that we finally had a chance to try it out.  We came by on a weekday night around 8PM and were promptly.  Despite it being somewhat late, the restaurant was still quite full and very lively.  

Service was top notch and wouldn't expect anything less.  At first, I was concerned that it would be a bit pretentious but it's nothing like that at all.  We ordered the mussels and frites to start.  Pretty much devoured it as well as the soup that mussels were cooked in. 

I ordered their signature burger.  Apparently it was burger week so the burger was extra special. Two giant onion rings (or was it three), nice and thick patty cooked just right and pulled pork. What. Gave me some inspiration for my next burger creation.

My partner ordered the pork belly and scallops.  Presentation was beautiful and really interesting flavours.  I'm not much of a scallops fan so she really enjoyed it.  

Great food, great service.  4 stars."}
{"text":"Visited Nash for lunch. The space is beautifully designed, great first impression walking into the restaurant but unfortunately there were a few problems. The hostess was rude, she didn't have a record of our reservation and seated our office team celebrating an important employee milestone in the bar on skinny bar tables which gave us barely enough room to eat. The food was just okay. Nothing spectacular. The server was harsh, really pushing alcohol and not overly friendly. Needless to say it was a disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Had dinner at the Nash on Sunday night. The food and the service were good. I was not happy with the Diver Scallop appetizer. It was $26.00(!!) and I received two scallops, each about the size of a loonie. Total, absolute rip off. The tab was $167.55 for two, including two apps, two entrees, two cocktails and the tip. Actually, I would have been okay with the cost if there had of been four scallops of if they had not been so small. The lamb pot roast was really good."}
{"text":"The Nash is located in the iconic national hotel on 11th street SE in Inglewood, just behind the Starbucks!  There is plenty of street parking and I believe I saw a sign for Nash parking as well.

My gf is expecting like ANY day now but near the end of last year I was too busy for life so I didn't have any time to plan anything until the New Year. She's due on January 11 and I planned this little baby shower get together for her on January 2.  I was looking for a place in Inglewood when another friend of mine mentioned The Nash.  SWEEEET! I haven't tried this place and I heard good things AND it's in Inglewood!!!  I gave them a call to make a reservation for a group of 17 ladies on Saturday at noon.  When I called, it was easy, the hostess was very friendly and accommodating.  She did mention that since I had a large party they have a set brunch menu to make it easier for the kitchen, she mentioned that the set menu had a great selection so it was perfect. 

When we walked in, we were greeted by the hostess and over to your right, there is an offcut bar and an open concept kitchen with barstools around in the main area.  Our large rustic wooden table was right behind the hostess.  All of us were impressed by the beautiful table and d√©cor - we all raved that we wanted a table exactly like it.  The large table is tall can comfortably fit 16 but we had to squeeze in another which wasn't bad at all!  Right away, our waters were filled and drink orders were taken.  The set menu was already prepared for us and it consisted of soup of the day, a couple of starters, salads, sandwiches, classic breakfast, flatbread pizza, a burger and poutine. Our group ordered different menu items but the majority of us went with their take on the classic breakfast.  The soup of the day was a tomato, potato basil soup.... which sounds like an odd combination but I decided to go with it anyway which to my surprise was a cream soup and absolutely delicious! I think a swirl of sour cream on top garnished with basil would have been a nice touch.  The classic breakfast came with a large slice of double smoked bacon, two free range eggs, r√∂sti potatoes (grated potatoes), caponata (cooked sweet/sour vegetables made from chopped eggplant), and your choice of white, multigrain toast or english muffin.  Our table received orders one after the other but they must have forgotten about me because I had to ask about my dish.  Luckily I had my soup to sip on while I waited.  I was excited when my food arrived because I was huuuungry!! But I was glad everyone else was enjoying their meals. I really enjoyed the thick cut double smoked bacon, because you really can't go wrong with bacon, my preference for eggs was medium poached and it went perfectly cracked on my multigrain toast! The r√∂sti potatoes were nice, it has a nice crisp on the outside and the caponata was a different but good sweet/sour side!  I really liked the toast and I'm wondering if it was homemade because it was sooo good.

Our server was great, super attentive, constantly filling waters and taking plates away when we were finished allowing us to chat comfortably.  It was wonderful because after our meals, my gf opened all her gifts with no interruption!  It appeared that all of the ladies I was with really enjoyed their meals and were excited for their second visit at The Nash.  Can't wait to visit Nash again and try some things on their regular menu (and dessert ;))!"}
{"text":"The Nash, opened by the owner of the established restaurant NOtaBLE, was recommended to us by a number of people since its opening. Having enjoyed NOtaBLE on numerous occasions, we decided to give The Nash a try.

Environment - Situated in the National Hotel in Inglewood, the restaurant's atmosphere and ambience truly reflects the neighborhood's hipster and trendy vibes. The d√©cor felt like a mix of new and old without being too tacky and the open kitchen was welcoming. The restaurant was big but the acoustics kept the noise in check. The only downside to the restaurant was the chairs: you could feel a hard wood bar just behind your legs but your butt sinks in so that you feel like a kid at the table and have to raise your elbows to get your arms to eating position.

Food - The dinner menu has a good selection of choices and we were unsure what to order. Our server came to our rescue with decisive recommendations (a rarity - often we get the generic \"well it depends on your tastes\" line) and we ended up ordering the Ravioli of Duck Confit and Crispy Potato Rolls to start. Both dishes were fantastic in taste and presentation. The Ravioli was very well-balanced and didn't feel too rich. The Crispy Potato Rolls were crunchy and decadent. For the main entr√©e, we tried the Pan Roasted Duck Breast and the Pork Sirloin from the Rotisserie - what The Nash was known for. The duck breast and pork sirloin were cooked to perfection and full of flavor. The sides functioned to enhance the flavor of the main star of the dish and never let the main flavor become monotonous, like John Watson to Sherlock Holmes. However, I found myself cutting big portions of fat from the meat and that put a slight dent in an otherwise perfect meal. In their defense, I could not imagine getting the explosion of flavor in the meat without the fat. The Dark Chocolate Hazelnut Tart was a good finisher but wasn't as memorable as the rest of the dishes. We also tried the hot chocolate (special from the Hot Chocolate Festival) - this was perhaps the weakest. There was supposed to be salted caramel in it, but we tasted neither salt nor caramel.

Value - Amazing food and amazing service. Appetizers range from $10-20 and entrees from $30-50. I feel like the price is on the tad bit expensive side when you look at restaurants of comparable quality (e.g. Rouge), but every dish was better than solid.

Overall - The Nash is a great place for a fancy night out without the pomposity. The restaurant is quite welcoming and food is excellent."}
{"text":"Impeccable meal start to finish. While waiting in the lounge the music was way too loud (seriously turn it down) making it brutal trying to hear anyone else. However, everything from the side orders to the main was amazing. I had the duck and it was something I would order every day given the chance. The chef came out to meet us and the atmosphere was totally wonderful. I definitely recommend The Nash for a meal out."}
{"text":"Went bask again today.  The brisket was great and scallop dad fantastic.  Very good meal!"}
{"text":"If you love Notable you will love The Nash. Hidden n just off 9th Ave in Inglewood this place has modern western written all over it. We enjoyed a glass of wine at the bar and a fantastic charcuterie plate following our exploration of Inglewood. 

The charcuterie was exceptional. Lots of cheeses and meats all made onsite. We can't eat grain so they brought a stack of long English cucumbers instead of bread slices. Add this to the exceptional Pinot Noir and this is one of the best meals we have had in a long time. 

The staff are excellent and non-intrusive. Service was outstanding. I am a big fan of Notable but would make the extra drive to hit The Nash for a slight change with the same quality of food and service. Thanks"}
{"text":"I love this place.  The decor is so classy without feeling precious, it's really beautiful inside.  The lounge at the front of the restaurant, Off Cut, reminds me of being in Edinburg, Scotland.   It's warm and cozy in a gentlemanly way.  The food and drink here is wonderful.  Just the other day we shared the mushroom ragout and a sandwich plate of a grilled cheese sandwich and tomato soup.  The ragout was full of wild mushrooms, so rich and satisfying.  And the grilled cheese and soup was total comfort food.  The soup had a lovely enhancement of basil which, to me, is the perfect accompaniment to tomatoes.  It was a great experience.  Highly recommend this place.  It is a bit on the pricey side, but totally worth it to treat yourself here."}
{"text":"Our favourite restaurant in Calgary! Since finding this gem almost a year ago my husband and I visit The Nash once a month or so when we are in Calgary for the weekend. We have brought family and friends here and everyone always enjoy themselves. This past Saturday we had yet another great experience. The servers, hostesses and staff are very accommodating and kind. We usually order the same things each time we come (you can see from the photos I have uploaded!). The meat off the rotisserie is always my husband's go to meal. I love their large kale salad. Being a vegetarian there are great options too! Dishes we have tried and loved include: the beetroot salad, char grilled pacific octopus, handcraft daily bread with Nash butter, their beautiful charcuterie board (must try!), kale salad, seared rare albacore tuna carpaccio, ravioli of duck confit, mussels & frites. For mains the meat off the rotisserie is great, also the black apron beef and innisfail lamb sirloin are other great options my husband likes. Definitely try the side of cafe au lait saut√© mushrooms, so tasty! 
Great spot in YYC! Can't wait to return :)"}
{"text":"Once again I wish that you were allowed to give .5 stars on this site because I think The Nash deserves a 3.5. My girlfriend and I shared the Steak Tartare and the Windy Acres Rabbit and Pork Terrine for starters. For my entree I chose the Flat Iron Steak which was pretty good but unfortunately her choice of the Lamb Shank was a poor one and the dish did not live up to expectations. The best plate of the night belonged to the Rabbit and Pork Terrine but it probably wasn't enough to salvage an average dinner experience. We probably won't be back to The Nash with all of the great dinner options in Calgary."}
{"text":"I always have an amazing meal at the Nash. The food is unbeatable. Love the atmosphere and great service. We love the charcuterie (however, last time we were in they significantly reduced the size of it, which was a bit disappointing. That being said, it's still by far the best charcuterie I've had in yyc).

Can be a bit noisy during peak hours. Definitely book a reso if you want to sit in the dining room on Friday or Saturday night. They have these strange mixed tables where you sit with people you don't know. I can see how that would be appealing to some, but if you're looking for a quiet place to go on a date it might not be your best bet unless you have a reso for two! The lounge is also amazing, and sometimes they even have live jazz. Fantastic bar. 

Easily one of Calgary's top restaurants & better than Notable (Chef Noble's restaurant in Bowness). Lots of character and located in a historic building in trendy Inglewood. A must try!"}
{"text":"My fianc√© and I ate here with her sister and husband while we were in town doing some wedding planning. 

We got there a bit earlier than our reservation, and we're seated promptly, which was nice. Our server was very attentive and I had a prosecco in my hand in no time! The cocktails, however, were a different story. The bar was clearly backlogged, which caused a fairly long delay for the resort of the table. In fact, by the time they got their drinks, I was on my second. Need to staff up to make sure you can keep up with the activity. 

Food was insane. The pork tenderloin was amazing. The gnocchi was buttery goodness and the greens were insane.

Well done Calgary! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Second trip to Nash and they just can't get things going. This time brunch with friends where I had the burger.  Despite being a blend of a pork and beef patty, I haven't had this dry of a burger in a long time. Gross.  The fries were not well prepared either.  They look like they were the leftover bits at the bottom of the fryer where the majority of pieces are no longer than the width of a loonie.  

Our server was great but pretty disappointed that she took an order from a 3 year old without checking with the parents first.  Had an order of waffles and eggs for a child.  Best $24 direct to doggie bag purchase ever.

The cocktails are good but super pricey."}
{"text":"Great space and the food was delicious. Every time we've been there the servers have been great too!"}
{"text":"Best fine but relaxed dining experience in the city. The food, cocktails, and atmosphere are an absolute delight. The mushroom and celeriac dish is so full of flavour I could eat it together. Good portions of food for appetizers and mains, with great quality. I would come here again and again!"}
{"text":"Love Notables. Love Nash. 

The atmosphere and decor...lovely, cozy, chic. 
The service......friendly, knowledgeable, prompt
The food.......flippin' delicious!!!

Appy.....best octopus I have ever eaten, so tender. Ham and foie gras, rich and flavourful 
Dinner....daily rotisserie was a tenderloin, cooked to perfection
Dessert...buckwheat and honey, delightful

Well done!
Would go back and recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"We have been to THE NASH 26 times now (I keep receipts for my business) and it has become one of our favourite mid-to-high-end dining spots.

When you walk in the door you will immediately notice a blend of modern and classic architecture styles and an open kitchen concept surrounded by great looking comfortable spaces. It really is an incredible setup - even for Inglewood's unique classic spaces.

I have tasted many dishes off the changing menu at this point and I have been impressed by every bite. I love the added creativity to the drinks and dishes when called upon too. 

The service is another area where the Nash shines. You set the bar high Nash!

This has become our go-to location for wining and dining our clients. 

Thanks David, Mike, Jessica, the amazing chefs & bartenders, etc. etc. etc.! 

See you soon!"}
{"text":"Good service, good atmosphere. The food had nice plating but our steak tartare was over salted and when we notified the server she said there had been more than one complaint that night and the cook realized she did over salt.. The server apologized but the appetizer was never taken off the bill. For an expensive place I would've expected more."}
