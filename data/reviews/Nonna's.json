{"text":"Decided to try this place around the corner from me. Went on a Friday night but it wasn't very packed (perhaps due to the construction).

Food was very average and didn't taste memorable. Didn't see that many customers as well."}
{"text":"This is primarily a review of Nonna's Italian sandwiches, particularly the veal cutlet sandwich. We have been getting these sandwiches as take-out for almost four years. They started off quite good, but earlier this year they changed the way they prepare the veal in their veal sandwich, and it has been very disappointing. There are more pieces of veal than before, which would seem like an excellent thing, except that the meat is now pounded to a paper thin sheet, with tons of breading pressed on. There is way more breading than veal in every piece. The sandwich now consists of layer upon layer of this gummy breading, with whisper-thin sheets of flavourless grey veal at intervals throughout, the stale bready taste ineffectively masked by the tomato sauce and peppers. The texture is just gross. As a result, Nonna's has gone from a \"pretty good Italian sandwich place\" to \"our absolute least favourite Italian sandwich place\".

On a separate note, the pizzas are still fairly delicious, if you're in the mood for a splurge-y gourmet pizza in Markham. But in general, we've lost most of our motivation to choose Nonna's when deciding on food options in the area."}
{"text":"We are fairly regular customers - went last night - 3 of us - had 2 main courses - lamb chops & pizza and 2 caprese salads, 3 glasses of wine, a Diet Coke and a cappuccino. Hardly anyone in the place - meal took about 30 to 45 minutes to be served. Everyone was happy with the food but...Bill was an outrageous $109. This is totally ridiculous for a place like this. $36 per head for 2 main dishes. They really need to look at their pricing policies. It's pretty unlikely we'll be going back!"}
{"text":"Went there for my birthday and was surprised at their menu. The place was a little small and it definitely had a feel of a tradition nonna's home. I personally think they should update the decor a bit to match their food.

I ordered penne alla vodka (which they don't make with penne anymore for whatever reason) and was sad to see that it was cooked with meat -though there was no mention of meat in the menu. I'm a pescatarian so I wasn't happy however my friend wanted to swap her plate with mine so we moved on. I then had the penne arrabiata which was fantastic. The perfect amount of spicyness!

We also ordered the calamari and the bruschetta, both were wonderful and delicious, highly recommend those! A friend of mine got the lobster linguine which was a special of the evening, I thought it was delicious however my friend didn't share the same point of view. It wasn't \"creamy\" enough for my friend but as I dislike cream sauces it tasted perfect for me. Another friend ordered the risotto which I also really liked.

They changed their menu in store from their online menu so I think they need to update that. Besides the meat issue in my penne alla vodka the food was wonderful and I would go again.

Staff was friendly and you can likely see the kitchen from where you're sitting."}
{"text":"We often get takeout pizza from here and it is great. We ate in once, we had pasta and lasagna.  Both were mediocre.  We stick with the pizza now."}
{"text":"May not look like much when you drive by the Markham strip mall but it would be a mistake to over look this hidden gem. Fantastic homemade pasta dishes (I love the Gnocchi), delicious wood burning Pizza and authentic Italian Wedding soup. The sandwiches are also all great. Service is good and feels like a family place. We also wrap up dinner with some good Tiramisu. The only negative is the Calamari - just to much breading and you can't taste the calamari."}
{"text":"Tried Nonna for the first time .

Mixed review on this one.

If I was to start with the good, the schnitzel sandwich was amazing.  Taste was on point and meat was seasoned really well.   Really large portion as well (ordered a few sandwiches to share with friends, portions were all really good).

Few negatives about the place.   Firstly, a warning on take out.   Prices are subject to change and have changed.  The website pricing is incorrect and you will get a surprise on your bill.   The take out menu has the same problem and is outdated they say.   They get around this because the website and the box holding the take out menu all say \"subject to change\".   For example online and on take out menu both say jumbo ravioli is $22 (surprise) it's $25 (and it is 5 pieces so eat slowly they are $5 each), flavour was pretty good though.  Sandwich prices are also all wrong for the most part (schnitzel is worth the extra $2 though).   Meatball sub I found was pretty disappointing, lacked seasoning and meat ball was mainly bread crumbs.   

Also ordered the gnocchi, nothing to really write home about on this one, and they should change the size of the take out containers, portion didn't even fill the bottom of the tray there were parts where u could still see the aluminum.

All in all, probably will not be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Good Italian food.  Haven't been here for years since their first week of opening.  Couldn't understand why we were the only table here on a Sunday night?   Had the chicken cutlet sandwich and pepperoni pizza.  I'm not the biggest fan if the thin crust but my dinner mate liked it.   I'm surprised this place deserves to be much busier.   Service was decent, clean place and priced fair."}
{"text":"As an update to my review from before, I'm definitely not satisfied with the quality of food that I got this time around.  I suppose with my previous experiences I should just not have gone, but I did.  

I ordered the piquante pizza as a late night snack never had any issues with their pizzas.  I went and picked it up and again they didn't have it ready in the timeframe they said they would have it ready by.  Got home and opened the box and was sorely disappointed as you could tell they were skimping on the ingredients.  They had signs all throughout saying that due to the increase in food prices that prices had increased.  So if the cost of the pizza increased than the quality should remain the same.  Mostly it was filled with just tomato sauce, there was very little cheese, sauces or hot peppers.  For $15 save the your money you definitely not getting any quality for that price.  It's a shame too because at one point they used to have the best wood oven pizzas around."}
{"text":"I love me some authentic Italian food!

Now I must first tell you a very embarrassing and shameful truth.  I grew up on the likes of Olive Garden, which I thought was real Italian cuisine. I know, I know sad but true, but I was none the wiser. 

Since moving to Ontario, and marrying a husband who grew up with some Italians, he showed me what real Italian cuisine is supposed to taste like.

Capelline con Pomodoro is my absolute favorite dish and their Veal Cutlet sandwich is real good.

I can never step through an Olive Garden ever again now that I've seen the light!"}
{"text":"Buyer beware: they have increased their prices and not updated the menu. If you ask about the up charge on the bill, the cashier will point to a sign that says \"prices are subject to change\"."}
{"text":"Nonna's is great if you have the time.  The food is well portioned and delicious however oftentimes the wait is long as they seem to be short staffed.  One time we went on our lunch break and one of my colleagues didn't even get his meal and the rest of us had to take it to go.  Another time we had 2 toddlers with us who got impatient as we waited over half an hour for our lunches.  I would definitely go back when I have the time to wait."}
{"text":"Tomato sauce is on point! They're so proud they even bottle it up to sell it! Had a pasta and a pizza to share for two. Did not care that it was too much food for the two of us. As we continued to enjoy it for the next 3 following days. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizzas & salad, pasta is great too. The only thing i'm not a fan of is their veal sandwiches. Yes, they pile the meat on, but it is paper thin and mostly breading - also expensive once you add all your fav toppings.  Stick to the pizza, pastas & salad if you want to check them out!"}
{"text":"2nd time here, I have to say mama mia que bellisima! one of the best veal sandwiches ($12) and veal parmigiano with spaghetti ($16) I've ever had.  Their homemade sauce has a perfect balance of taste, and added bonus is the fact that it's not acidic in comparison to most marinara sauces out there! place is clean, the service is honest and always willing to provide recommendations. I'll be back for the classic and one of few wood oven pizza joints left in the GTA.....they don't use gas for their stoves btw"}
{"text":"Friday evening at Nonna's. Who could ask for anything more!? This has been our all time favourite Italian restaurant since they opened in 2008. We always choose a variety of options on the menu, and share them. On our last visit we enjoyed the fried calamari, the pizza primavera, the lasagna, and last, but not least, their fabulous eggplant Parmesan. What a party that was! They never disappoint!"}
{"text":"I ordered a lasagna for lunch.  It was rather big at 6 inches x 6 inches x 1.5 inches thick.  It was a classic lasagna consisting of layers of pasta sheets and very thin layers of meat and cheese in between.  I think it can have more cheese for sure.  I like the tomato sauce the most.  It tasted fresh, as in not from a can, and not too sour."}
{"text":"Ordered a ravioli pasta to go. Food tasted good but for what I paid I was expecting more. To me the ravioli seemed a bit plain. It was simply stuffed with powered cheese and topped with tomato sauce. Yes I know, that pretty much describes what ravioli is but I think what was missing was some meat in the tomato sauce or something. I forget how much the cost but all I remember is that I gave them a $20 bill and didn't get much change back. This place would not be my first recommendation for Italian food."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with a few friends. They have a wood burning oven so their pizza is a safe choice - thus I ordered a Sicilian pizza ($13), with the salty goodness of olives and anchovies. Good crispy thin crust.

My friends ordered ravioli ($15) and linguine ($14), and they weren't that impressed by it.

Overall, it's okay food that you'd get at any Italian restaurant, but the prices seem a bit high for the portions/decor - seems like they're trying to do fine dining, but the location/area doesn't quite match."}
{"text":"Gnam gnam Nonna!
It may lie hidden in a corner of a suburban plaza, but once you find it, you will discover some of the best Italian food in Markham. Nonna's wood-burning pizza is authentically delicious, a thin crust with just the right amount of mozzarella and tomato. My favourite is the Pizza Margherita ... simple but good. Their Italian wedding soup is a must have, and their veal sandwiches are amazing. I have been here with my family many times, and in addition to the food, the friendly service and warm atmosphere keep us coming back. Nonna's offers take out service, which is great for bringing that yummy pizza home! Don't forget to end your meal with a really good espresso and/or the tiramisu which definitely lives up to it's name. Grazie Nonna!"}
{"text":"Came here to get takeout on a Sunday night. Only one server around on a quiet evening, but he was quite rude, and made me feel like I was being an inconvenience. Ordered two veal sandwiches and a portion of lasagna. 

The sandwiches were huge, and they were generous with the toppings. We found the lasagna, despite what the server said, to be a perfect portion for two. However, the food was still pricey for how much you get, and tasted like Italian food I could have gotten anywhere else.

We probably would end up coming back since we're close by, but it wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"Food was good but service was slow. Waiter couldn't handle the few tables on a dead Sunday night. Terrible attitude and constant eye-rolls."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time for take out.

I got the veal sandwich and loaded it with mild peppers, onion, mushroom, and cheese.
The sandwich came out to be pretty pricey with the additional toppings but I expected it.

The sandwich was HUGE. I have a pretty big mouth but I could not bite into the sandwich like i could a Big Mac. I'm a pretty big eater as well but I could only finish half the sandwich. In addition to that, I was starving at the time. The other half of the sandwich I saved as 2 separate \"snacks\". Really, each quarter was a meal.

The sandwich was not the best veal sandwich I've had. I would have rather had a smaller sandwich that tasted amazing than a gigantic sandwich that tasted good. But I guess i got a good bang for the buck.

I will come back to try out the other menu items."}
{"text":"The last 2 times we were there, the Seafood Linguine definitely not as good as before........ Seafood is not as fresh, the scallops became little bay scallops....."}
{"text":"This place is hidden in the Garden Basket plaza, next to the Rogers Video at 16th and Hwy 48, Markham, ON. 

The decor is easy on the eyes but very basic, no tablecloths and the napkins are paper. They play great Italian music which we really enjoyed.

My husband had the quattro formaggio pizza ($13.99 - tomato sauce, mozzarella, gorgonzola, goat cheese, topped with parmigiano) and loved it. I had the salmon and risotto special which was good, but the risotto was a tad bland, I think it was lacking salt.
For dessert we had a mini-canolli, which was pretty good, and chocolate swirl cheesecake which wasn't very good, it wasn't fresh.

The service was excellent and we would go back to this nice neighbourhood restaurant."}
{"text":"The worst Italian I have ever had in my life. Pasta and pizza are mediocre/sub par AT BEST. Unfortunately had the chance to try their veal, disgusting. Tough and veiny. Not tender melt in your mouth like it should be.

Staff inattentive. Stood at the front door for what felt like forever. Didn't come check up on us. Basically, in simpler terms, couldn't even handle the basics of handling guests. 

There are a bunch of better Italian joints, some in Markham, couple in Richmond hill, \"Cucina Locale\", \"Nonna's Oven\" for example which both blow this place off the map of Italian food. 

Never again will I come here. I'd rather starve."}
