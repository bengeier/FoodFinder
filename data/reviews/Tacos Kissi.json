{"text":"I tried the shrimp cocktail and four tacos special with the cowboy beans, shrimp cocktail was awesome and the street tacos were yummy.  The salsa bar was really good to put it on it was all fresh and their tortilla chips didn't taste like they were a week old they were great I'll definitely go back there"}
{"text":"OK so its a dive....but its a dive in the good way meaning thats a fantastic food tucked away behind a pretty ugly storefront.  Still if you know the neighborhood then you know not to get too scared away by the exterior and the inside has always been clean.  The tacos are legit as are the fresh juices.  I can't comment on the mexican sushi, it just hasn't attracted me, but i'm sure I'll give it a go one day soon since everyone 
keeps commenting on how good it is.  If you want quality street tacos then this is about as good as they come."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time and we loved it. Everything was kept clean and the staff was very helpful and friendly. The prices are great for what you get too. My boyfriend and I both got a taco plate including 4 tacos of your choice, a drink, and charro beans and every bite was delicious! I've lived in this neighborhood forever and I'm so sad that I've never been here until now. I believe it was the owner who talked to us and made sure everything was good. They run a great business here and he alone made us feel very welcome to come back again. I have a feeling we're gonna become regulars here lol. You have to try this if you've never been here!"}
{"text":"The price for one tiny toco is outrageous, not to say my tortilla was so dry and cracked. On top of that it was some of the worst carne asada I have ever had, it was so salty. I will never go back or recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Wow! A hidden Gem! I'm staying in Phoenix on a business trip from California! A guy at the hotel I'm staying in recommended this place and oh boy! Was he right!!! This is a true Mexican taqueria! My wife had a asada torta and (Paco) the owner recommended birria tacos and they come with Ranchero beans!!!! Omg I wanted to take some home!!! Ask for the ranchero beans!! You won't regret it! My kid had a hot dog and my daughter chicken nuggets with fries. I tried two other \"authentic\" Mexican restaurants but they are not what I expected. I will definitely eat here again before I go back to California and or when I come to Phoenix!!! I will definitely recommend this place! Btw friendly service and very affordable!"}
{"text":"Tacos all pastor were awesome and so was the service.   You have to try the salsa and chips, top notch!!!!"}
{"text":"Finally stopped in after seeing it all the time. I'm so glad I did, definitely my new favorite taco spot. We ordered the tacombo with 2 carne asada tacos and 2 pastor. The tacos were perfection in my eyes. The perfect street taco. We each topped them with cabbage and salsa from the salsa bar. The salsa was amazing. We also ordered the ruby roll. It had shrimp and avocado wrapped in FRIED rice. Best idea ever. They brought us a spicy mayonnaise and a soy sauce.. The mayo was to die for. Prices were right, service was great. I'll be back next week!"}
{"text":"First time here. Found it on yelp. Tried the hotdog tastes really straight out of mexico. And also the sopes legit! Strongly recommed if you want real mexican food"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times for lunch and it's great food. I have gotten a Barito and tacos both are great."}
{"text":"Excellent tacos (shrimp, tilapia, and shredded beef) and wonderful salsa/toppings self serve bar. Everything homemade and amazing! Great prices! They even have ice cream! Will go back again! Great place to stop near the airport."}
{"text":"Love this place i am a regular there at least 3 times a week! Tostadas de carne. Desebrada is my. Favorite!!"}
{"text":"We were visiting Phoenix and we found Tacos Kissi on Yelp.  We had the best experience there!  The people were great and the food was very very good.  We have a lot of Mexican options where we live near the southwest side of Chicago, but this place would hold its own against any and all of them.  It's a real gem.  It would take us about an hour to get to this place from where we usually stay in the Phoenix area, but I guarantee we will be back on our next trip!"}
{"text":"A great little hole in the wall Mexican place. Not much to look at from the outside but come inside and find a very clean, comfortable place.

You can't help but notice the awesome salsa bar.  Great selection and very fresh. 

And here is where it gets really interesting.... Sure they have all the traditional Mexican food and that is delicious but they also have carne asada fries and... Wait for it.... Mexican sushi!

Now, I had the pastor tacos, carne asada tacos and the carne asada fries all of which were amazing; but I wasn't hungry enough to tack on the Mexican sushi.  I'm sure, based on my experience that the Mexican sushi would have been just as delightful. 

If your in the area, do yourself a favor and treat your tastebuds to some great flavor!"}
{"text":"They're great, with great food and good prices, I've tried almost everything there and i haven't been let down yet, good stuff, try it!"}
{"text":"I came here with some friends to get some tacos! Can I just say, DO NOT JUDGE. Based on the location, I know it's a little sketchy.. But I thought, why not? LOL. It's a lot cheaper than Joyride. I got the asada, chicken, and shredded beef tacos. OMG HANDS DOWN some of the best tacos-holy.. And their horchata is bomb  LOVE THE SALSAS AND CHIPS TOO. SO FRESH. Okay, you guys need to check this place out."}
{"text":"Came here because of the great reviews. Had their version of a carne asada burrito and sushi which had carne asada in it. The burrito was tasty but the carne asada was chewy and had hard bits in it which was rather unpleasant. The taste was okay but nothing to write home about. The sushi was... Odd. It appeared to be deep fried and has cream cheese in it. It wasn't necessarily bad and I might have eaten more than one piece if it wasn't for the chewy carne asada. The horchata was delicious and I could see myself stopping in just for that. The salsa bar really impressed me. It was well stocked and fresh and the pico de gallo was probably the best I have ever had. It is obviously homemade. The restaurant was exceptionally clean and the staff were very friendly. I will probably return to try something different.. I have to have that horchata and pico again :)"}
{"text":"Place is clean and the stuff are friendly,price is reasonable.I love the  tacos with chicken breast, always order:)"}
{"text":"My son and I just went there. We ordered the taco combo and a torta de pierna to split. Everything is delicious! Tacos al pastor, asada and birria. My son had horchata and I had agua de piña. Both really good. The place is nice and clean. Salsas are really good and go from mild to really hot! The girl that took our order is really nice and helpful answering our questions. We'll keep coming back! Nice job tacos kissi!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing!  Friendly staff and welcoming environment.  Although it looks shady on the outside the place is amazing and the food is fresh and delicious"}
{"text":"I am a taco kissi lover forsure ! Love all the food from seviche , tacos , sushi and ice cream cones they have it all ! Great costumer service"}
{"text":"High alert !!! Make sure if you plaining to dine in bring your own fan. Restaurant didn't have their A/C on.Temperature of the restaurant was 83 degrees and current temp outside was 101. We even took a picture. The tacos were alright . The cleanliness of the restaurant I would give them 3 . Tables were sticky. Overall they need to stop being stingy and turn the A/C. Especially here in Az. It's was ridiculous hot."}
{"text":"The food is awesome! Great prices and friendly quick service. Had the tacombo, one pastor,  one cabeza, one chicharron, and one shrimp. All on flour. Super delicious! The charro beans were bomb and reminded me of beans my Nana makes. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So delicious!! My new favorite place. Sushi was actually better than I've had at a lot of sushi joints. Great customer service too!"}
{"text":"Sushi and tacos were great!!!!

The sushi was delicious and a GENEROUS amount. My husband had the carne asada burrito and it was great as well the only thing that was missing was some guacamole. I had two tacos and a order of sushi to split between the both of us. 

The alpastor taco was delicious and the carne asada taco was good as well. Will definitely worth the money. Will definitely come back soon for the food and value. 

Almost forgot to mention they also have a salsa bar with other condiments such as lemon, cilantro, cabbage, and all sorts of salsas."}
{"text":"Great prices! The salsas were really good and fresh, the tacombo was worth it!  4 tacos with fresh made tortillas and a bowl of really good beans for around $8. The mar y tierra sushi is delicious!  And I recommend the horachata."}
{"text":"first time here with my family and the food was awesome!!!! I had a torta, the best torta I've ever had. If you want some really good Mexican food this is the place ."}
{"text":"Carne asada tacos. A solid B-. Meat was very greasy so be advised. Maybe the cook was having an off night. Will be back and see if this changes. Otherwise would have been B+ or A- as far as the tacos go. 

Horchata was pretty good. Lots of cinnamon, very sweet. Perhaps a bit too much. I give it a B-."}
{"text":"Great service and food. However they do not sell beer at this location. Nice employees."}
{"text":"Found these guys on yelp and stopped in for lunch. Its a little divey (in a positive way) place. It was clean, busy. I'm pretty sure the owners were working behind the counter. They were friendly and accommodating.

I was with a friend and we decided to split a plate of 4 tacos which came with 1 side of house beans, we also ordered a side of refried beans and two drinks.  The cost was about $12 for everything.  Chips were complimentary. There was a serve yourself salsa bar with vegetables, salsas, lemons and limes. Everything looked fresh and it was cleanBobbi

The tacos were served in a plastic basket,  wrapped in foil, the beans in  styrofoam cups. The house beans were soup like and they were excellent. The tacos were came with only one  thin shell which which made it difficult to hold the filling in. Two shells each would have been perfect, but still they were very good.

Overall I liked this place and would, for sure, stop in again if in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Just had my first Mexican sushi and it was on point. All natural lemonade was a great companion to a great meal. Have eaten there many times before and have always liked the food everytime. Service is always good and place is always clean. Nothing fancy just great food by hard working people who give their food that homemade Mexican flavor that has yet to disappoint me. Thanks to all who work there for always making me a satisfied customer."}
{"text":"Good food and fresh and hot. A little slow to get the food out but worth the wait. Great veggies stand."}
{"text":"Hands down best taco spot in PHX! Have been going here for 2 years now, never been disappointed. You have the option to call in orders,super convenient, they have till today never messed up an order. I have tried there:
Tostada with carne Desebrada which comes with Consome,Bomb! 
The Sopes are also delicious, my boyfriend's fave. The Cocktail de Camaron also the bomb
BUT my FAVORITE of all their Taco Combos which come with 4 tacos of your choice(homemade tortillas corn or flour, add cheese for $1), a side of Frijoles Charros(yaassss) and a med drink(horchatas my fave, the real deal aguas none of that fake powdered stuff)is the most filling and delicious combo I've had from any taco spot. 
Ooh n not to mention there snack options, Mexican candy, fresas con crema, flan etc. They also sell tortillas de harina, for those of us who don't have our abuelitas or moms close to hook us up, these are the next best thing. If your thinking about going here I definitely recommend it you will not be disappointed.

All the staff is super nice including the Manager n his Wife their there almost every time I go and are super amables."}
{"text":"Just came in here tonight for our first visit. We have only lived in the area for about 10 months  and have been hoping to find some good restaurants around. 

Had the shrimp cocktail (AMAZING) and carne asada tacos. The salsa bar is perfect and the customer service is out of this world. We have been to far more expensive \"fancy\" restaurants and didn't get treated as well as we did at Kissi.

A+ quesadillas, too. You'd think most places wouldn't have so much trouble with cheese and a tortilla -- this one is perfect. 

We'll be back next week for more!"}
{"text":"Just came here today. No mexican roots but I know my mexican food.  Great street tacos. Your chioce of soft corn or flour tortilla. I had the asada, pastor and chicken fajita tacos. Chicken fajita was the best.  It was tender juicy and delicious.  The pastor came in second and was flavorful. Asada taco was a little dry and had a small bone that could have broke a tooth! Horchata was made in house and yummy. Not too sweet; the way I like it. Salsas were fresh and delicious too! Tomatillo salsa is awesome! Nice little salsa bar and free chips for those eating in.  All in all a great little place and one I would come back to. Nothing to look at but good food. I look forward to trying other things on the menu but will probably pass on the asada taco next time."}
{"text":"Had one of each taco with a friend, couldn't go wrong with any choice on the menu.  The tacos come in small street taco size so you can easily try one of each.  Pork and shrimp tacos were the 2 favorites."}
{"text":"I have NEVER tasted Carne Asada like this before!! Real authentic Mexican food at its finest! Their homemade tortillas are the best that you can even purchase separately! I made a trip here at least one a week when I lived in Phoenix and I can't wait to move back to visit time & time again!"}
{"text":"They have Bad bad customer service  first of all I've ordered the same menu item 4 diffrent times and I  guess it's a supply in demand type of thing. At the time whenever they have shredded cheese and can speak english and I guess I should order it then ??? CarNesAda NacAhOs. THE reason why I said it that way was because my son took my order over the speaker phone, though the lady who's attending the cash register,  who's also the owner and the cook and knows how to speak good English on a good day when she wants to was listing and conversations back and fourth and with my son and about the the food items I'm not allowed to have. The cook put nacho cheese sauce on my carnesada nacho chip . When my son told him and I told him I want queso shredded and the meat . He said we don't have shredded cheese when my son brought the un touch order back up there to them ,and we talk to them on the phone and said we didn't order no super nacho when your wife and my son was talking about my stomach surgery why would I  order a super nacho with nacho cheese.  I also recorded all my   calls and I'm willing to up loaded because. They sat there called the order back and we made sure and They still got it wrong and didn't  want to remake my order with shredded cheese said they didn't have any , saw that the order wasn't touch. The food look disgusting with old running cheese over cook carnesada  meat and every thing but the kitchen sink on it. They didn't refund our money or see if we wanted another menu item or nothing. My son left the food there. It wasn't edible at all.. The first and second time cook just right, the owner lady cooked it really good , she told me a lol about her Resturant ,  third time ran out of queso cheese use sharp cheddar the meat was harsh wasn't season or marinade at all, 4 everything all bad everybody knows you don't put nacho cheese sauce on carnesada meat it cancel out the flavor of the meat unless it's chicken or ground beef or its just plain nasty as he'll. And I want my money back you thieves."}
{"text":"We were very pleased with both the service and the food.  Our first trip there.  Family owned and operated.  Very friendly and helpful.  As authentic as it gets.  The carne asada is excellent.  We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Ok I'm a self proclaimed taco expert. This place is really 4.75 stars. I'm just a AL pastor nazi and I'm searching for a flavor that they are pretty close to. Rice great the beans amazing. All taco meat flavors where very flavorsome. Nice fresh salsa bar also"}
{"text":"Finally found a GREAT taco and sushi place in Phoenix ever since I moved here from Cali! Let me tell you, me and my husband were so satisfied with everything we got! We ordered four tacos (carne Asada and al pastor) and two orders of sushi (kissi roll and rubi roll) all to go. Nice people working there and very attentive! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Coming home from a bad resturant, we saw this little taco place and decided to try it and I have to say best service I have seen in a long time and the resturant is clean very clean and the food is delicious if i could give it 10 stars I would. I highly recommend this place if you're everin the mood for tacos"}
{"text":"So GOOD. 

Every bite was delicious. 

We ordered 6 carne asada tacos, 1 fish taco, bottled coke and a coke can....total was under $16 :) The asada tacos come plain but don't worry...there is a salsa bar with different salsas, onions, pico, lime, cilantro, carrots and jalapeños (basically any taco topping you need). Asada meat is great...no fat....A lot of the the other taco places I've been to don't really seem to understand that gristle, is not good. The fish taco came with lettuce, tomato and red onion...very good.

The service is great.....seems family owned and operated....I love that!

This place hit the spot! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Best Carne asada fries I have had. The salsas are bomb and tase real. Customer service is great I even got free chips to try the salsas The place is very clean. I will keep coming here for good. Que filibertos ni que nada!!"}
{"text":"I drive by here every day on my way home. I was finally able to come and enjoy this food. I loved the tacos. The carne asada quesadilla was just amazing!  The service was quick and very friendly!  Being able to also order to home made tortillas to go is just an added bonus! I can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"We were aching for some classic Mexican food and, while searching, we came across this place online. After reading the reviews, we decided to take a chance and boy are we glad we did!! This place met and blew away our expectations from beginning to end. 

Both gentlemen we talked to were kind, knowledgeable, and helpful. Their food was exceptional and handmade in every way (except maybe the French fries but they were excellently cooked so I'm happy either way!) Their ingredients are high quality and their attention to detail took our experience from 0 to 100 in seconds. We will go back in a heartbeat and I highly recommend you try it if you haven't already! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We have had carne asada and cabeza tacos and they are always outstanding. The fresh salsa bar is an awesome addition and perfect ingredients for your order. They have a variety of Mexican candy and thriftys ice cream which is the best! We are fans and will be recommending."}
{"text":"Every time I've been here the food is outstanding and I've been greeted with a smile by friendly people. 

Carne Asada Tacos and Carne Asada fries both great."}
{"text":"You drive past, you see this place.  The sign says Tacos Kissi, then you see it says tacos and sushi.  You think this is weird.  You drive past.  You have just made a huge mistake.
Do yourself a favor go in.  Eat some tacos, then try the sushi, cause, what the heck, right?
The sushi is delicious.  It is not traditional at all, start with the Kissi roll, then try the Mar Y Tierra.  Surf and turf all in one.
The tacos are incredible, all tortillas are made in house, and the meats are great.  My favorite is the tripas.  Crunchy yet soft.  The carne asada is also great.
Come back, try a torta.  
You will be back again, and again."}
{"text":"I was so pissed off last night when i ordered a torta from fillibertos.  It was disgusting...all the carnitas was burnt to hell...etc...

i was so mad- that tonight I set out to find a delicious torta. I found Kissi...WOW.

That was the best torta I have ever had. I had the pierna...the bread was very fresh, the meat was soft and perfect...ordered everything on it and added pico de gayo. I am pretty consistent and when i find something i like i stick with it. This is now my torta place.

Oh and they were very nice...i have never seen a menu like that, they explained all the different stuff...never heard of \"pastor\" or \"pierna\", etc...

Awesome."}
{"text":"I've lived in this area for so long and finally I went. This is the best Mexican food I ever had and they are nice and polite. The carne asada was high quality. The prices were just right . it's just good. The beans had cheese in them and were great."}
{"text":"Tacos are good and the salsa bar is always a plus. No soda machine, just cans. If they got a soda machine in here, I'd go more often. The sushi is just ok, but it still a pretty cool concept :) biggest drawback is the parking because there isn't any so if you are going with other people, go in one car!"}
{"text":"This place in amazing! You can have Tacos, Moriscos  and Sushi. I recommend the Kissi Roll."}
{"text":"This is my favorite go to place close to home. The shrimp tacos And shrimp Cocktail are my go to favorites. This family-owned restaurant has a wide variety of Mexican food. Including assorted Mexican sushi which I also love. So if you're in the area of 27th Ave. and Bethany home. This is the place to go."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to this place because we saw its five-star review. They have these super cheap mini tacos. Yes they are mini sized when served but then they have this salsa bar that you can fill up your taco an.d makE iT your own. All of the meat in the tacos and the salsas are authentic Mexican. All home-made by a crew that knows what they're doing. Also, the lady that served us was very friendly and willing to help us read the menu because it's all in Spanish :o Prices comparable to any other fast-food restaurants with quality of a dine-in restaurant and complimentary chips! We were very impressed and came back the very next day."}
{"text":"On our way to airport from Sedona and wanted to grab a quick bite of authentic Mexican food.  Found Tacos Kissi thru Yelp and was very pleased with Francisco's help asking me if it was my first time there and what kind of food I liked.  He showed me the condiment bar and all the different items to dress my tacos. Also,had bean soup that complemented the tacos. Very good food, really wish I would have tried his wife's Mexican Sushi too. Nice family owned business and great to see them all operating together."}
{"text":"Food is delicious!!! Service was fast! Everything is affordable! I had the chicharon tacos and shrimp tacos and everything was really fresh! The best part was they had flour tortillas for the street tacos! We definitely will come back for more!!"}
{"text":"Today I decided to try this place and what can I say?..
Food is perfect ,service on time plus you see a smile on workers faces for the entire time I was there. Great Place. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Fresh, fast, amazing owners! We came here for lunch, 4 of us! We tried the cevechi tostada, amazing packed with shrimp, lemon and cilantro. The carne asada tacos, perfectly seasoned tender grilled meat! The pastor torta, mouth watering marinated pork with cilantro, avocado, and the most delicious, fresh, soft, perfectly toasted bread! The ice cream, omg, seriously... And to top it off, they make their own agua fresita (sp), ( watermelon and 2 other flavors) and homemade horchata! You heard me... The best ever fresh horchata, the way your nana used to make it! This place is a must visit, eat and be happy! Eat and live well! Enjoy"}
{"text":"If you are looking to eat authentic Mexican tacos, this is the place. Every taco I have tried from this restaurant has been superb. Their salsa bar is amazing too. Their hot dogs are good, but not as good as other hot dog stands that I have tried. Same goes with the sushi. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't my favorite. If you are looking for some super delicious and authentic tacos though, this is the place."}
{"text":"You would never expect a combination Mexican restaurant/sushi restaurant to work. I was a little hesitant at first myself. But, we found this place on Yelp, and decided to give it a try. Very nice staff and excellent food! The sushi really works the way they do it! Lots of variety all with a Mexican flair.  The flavors are great and the variety is really good. Tortillas are all handmade to order and have a lot of flavor. But the sushi really is the unique. Definitely try this when you come. I don't think you will be disappointed with anything on the menu. Cannot wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"Awesome Mexican food. If u want authentic this is the place. Too many berto this and berto that has clouded the taste buds of AZ residents. If you want ur mouth to have a fiesta then try the tacos with any if their homemade salsas!!"}
{"text":"I only came to this restaurant because I grew up going to Lazy Lou's, the previous restaurant owners. I walked in mostly interested in how it had changed but ended up ordering carne asada tacos and a tostada de ceviche... amazing! Not only was the food delicious, but they had EXCELLENT customer service. I was very pleasantly surprised! I'm already going back for the 2nd time this week."}
{"text":"Very convenient location with great customer service. I was attracted to this place based on the good ratings and I saw a picture of the corn Asada fries. Even though I know I should be working on my diet I could not resist the french fries with major toppings. Service was excellent and the food was out within 10 minutes. Sometime the best food come from the least expected places."}
{"text":"Good value. Very good tasting food at an affordable price.  Parking is tough but I am somewhat of a regular there. Employees are friendly as well.  They do also have ice cream and a small has plenty of ice cream on it.  I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! I highly recommend this place to everyone! Don't let the hole in the wall appearance fool you!! The Mexican sushi was amazing and the carne asada tacos were to die for!! The place was super clean and spotless!!I will defiantly be coming back more
Often!!!"}
{"text":"I just went here yesterday for the first time. Its a hole in the wall place, but their tacos are seriously amazing. Al Pastor with corn tortillas are the best, but I haven't tried their sushi or other items. It's definitely worth your time for quick bomb and cheap tacos. Needless to say I will be a regular for them tacos though..."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican food restaurant in the whole valley, everything is delicious and 100% Mexican. All the employees are very friendly and nice. Totally worth the drive!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Good tacos. I really love the toastadas though. I wish more places would serve them. Beans, crunchy corn tortilla, cheese, avocado. Yum. 

The salsa is great and so are the frescas. The staff is amazing too."}
{"text":"Have not seen a combo like this since the Walmart in Juarez that had a sushi counter across the tortillarila. Had the carne asada burrito, sin arroz. Very tasty and fresh. I just wish they sold T-shirts so could take one back to Texas."}
{"text":"Great shrimp tacos, amazing flavors, I like the salsas and flavored beverages. I don't recommend the sushi, it didn't taste authentic and I believe cream cheese is used in every roll. Great service, everything homemade. I strongly recommend Taco Kissi"}
{"text":"We were in the mood for a taco shop but didn't feel like dealing with lines out the door as is common for some of the downtown taco shops.  

Service was excellent and they are super friendly.  Also, they have tacos with chicken breast and this is huge because I am a poultry racist.  (I just can't get into dark meat. I've tried.)  If you dine in, they bring you chips that are DELICIOUS.  Perfectly seasoned and the salsa is so good they should sell it.  (In hindsight, I should have asked because I would have loved to take some home.)  My fajita tacos were perfectly seasoned and they serve the tacos \"naked\" which is pretty genius because then you can visit the salsa bar and add to your heart's content.  

It's definitely divey, hole-in-the-wall-y but that's okay.  It's just off the 17 and quite convenient.  I will absolutely be coming back."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food tastes great and the portions are big. The people are friendly and the prices are good for the quality and quantity."}
{"text":"Excellent fresh food. Salsa was yummy too and not very expensive. Staff was also very friendly. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Wow holy F&@#!  I travel for work and eat out twice a day everyday of the year all over the country.  These tacos are one of the best if not the best I've ever had.  It's ridiculous the flavor is perfect tortillas made fresh in house and the salsa bar had a perfectionist approach to it.  Super fresh ingredients for everything even the toppings.  You can tell they really care about quality the service was also excellent I felt welcome right when they said hello no joke!  Give it a try you won't regret it"}
{"text":"Love this place. Close to my house, reasonably priced and everything have tried on the menu has been delicious. My favorite is the Tacocombo, Carne asada burritos are awesome."}
{"text":"Great restaurant!  Just opened. Let me say its great to see a Mexican restaurant in Phoenix bringing back home style Mexican food. Phoenix has been influenced by filibertos style food. But this does it as it should be. They use Angus beef for asada tacos, they shred their own cheese, have handmade tortillas, fry their own chips, make the salsa fresh evetyday with a salsa bar, homemade lemonade,  cocktail shrimp is delicious have a sweet flavor that reminds me of a homemade only flavor. 

Tacos were also great! I had the tacos de pastor and cabeza. The pastor was sweet and spicy great grill taste paired with their tomatillo salsa.
The cabeza was extremely tender, just like mom can only make.  

I wish the best for this place. Try it you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We ordered a variety of things. Pleasantly surprised by the tacos de cabeza and the mar y tierra sushi roll. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"this restaurant is just great. like so great that i go out of my way to eat here. the owners are all the same workers i see each time i come here. dont know if its family run or not but they know how to make some great tacos! they are hospitable and kind. they speak spanish as well as PERFECT english! i applaud them for their desire to spark up conversations with each and every customer, making them feel like family. their tacos are soooooooo good! quite possibly the best tacos i have ever had. and they make their own corn tortillas and wrap the tacos up in foil to keep them warm. they also know how to make a great shrimp ceviche tostada. most places overpower their ceviche with cheap salsa, but here they have a good amount of shrimp in there, that is actually cooked in the lime, not heated first which some places do. the flavor is not too saltless, just perfect. and they have tapatio which is the best mexican hot sauce out there. so im glad they use that. they also have a sushi menu i heard was pretty good but i have not tried them yet since i always come here ordering their awesome tacos. ive only been here a few times and the owner already knows my face. you cant beat a place like this! if you want tacos, it will be worth the extra few miles for this place. trust me!"}
{"text":"I love going to Tacos kissi at least once a week the service is great prices are decent very good Pina and horchata"}
{"text":"This taco shop is one of the better ones in the area!!! great carne asada tacos!! we called in our order ahead and it was hot and ready when I got there!! Great job Kissi!!"}
{"text":"The tacos here are amazing! Great price for great tacos and sushi as well. I come here like every other day and the workers are very nice people and Also the salsa bar is great!"}
{"text":"The food is good but a little pricey not  enough food always leave hungry there should be refill on the drinks I usually order 5 tacos not very fill maybe it should be 6 tacos more variety."}
{"text":"SOOOO GOOD!!!!
Some of the best carne asada I have had in a long time served with fresh hand made tortillas. I can't wait to come back and try the sushi, I did not leave room in my stomach this visit."}
{"text":"I was very skeptic about coming in thinking it was going to be another Filibertos but to my surprise it wasn't.  I ordered carne asada and pastor tacos and they were delicious...probably one of the best pastor tacos I have had in Phoenix.  The salsas were great and they serve complimentary chips.  I also ordered horchata which was a tad bit sweet for me.  They also have different Aguas Frescas to choose from.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is one of my new favorite spots.  Their food is great and their customer service is fantastic.  The onwner is very friendly and is always there making sure our experience is great.  Their tortas are so good, I would highly recommend and their tacos are also super tasty.   By the way they make fresh tortillas for your tacos.  I would really recommend this place if you like Mexican food, you must check it out."}
{"text":"Had to check out this place. Five stars, it's not. But it is pretty tasty and seems authentic. The setting is pretty simple and reserved. Prices are okay. I think $3 for a hot dog is a bit much and almost $4 for a quesadilla. But...you get free chips and salsa. No great customer service. But it was ok. Give it a try and see what you think."}
{"text":"This place is going to be legendary.  

In fact I'm a little irriated it's not already.  4.5+ on Yelp usually leads to little notoriety so thankfully I saw the stellar, spot-on review from Doug T. which lead me to this Phoenix gem.

The P and I were in the Hood visiting her Mother who has lived in the area since the early 70's,  Let me tell you, I'm a whole lot more excited to visit the Mother-in-law now that I know Tacos Kissi is a close-by lunch option.

Lunch consisted of four street tacos, two each of the carna asada and al Pastor.  Both fantastic!  Now keep in mind, these are street tacos, i.e. a couple of bites each-one or two tacos will not fill up a typical male carnivore.  Also, based on a Yelp tip, we went with the Ruby Roll (Mexican Sushi).  I know it's early in the year but I may have already discovered my favorite meal of 2016. Tempura shrimp, cream cheese, avocado, fried rice, more tempura- WOW, amazing!  They bring out spicy mayo, soy sauce, and I think hoisin sauce-not sure but I can tell you it was fantastic.  On top of the hoisin sauce I drizzled some of their best-in-class salsa from the salsa bar.

Did someone say Salsa Bar?  Aside from the Pico, the salsa is hot and hotter with some of the  best flavors I've ever enjoyed in any salsa.  Clearly homemade with excellent heat, notes of cilantro and lime- they should bottle it and sell it. The bar also has onions, cabbage, pickled carrots, etc to top your chips and tacos.  Chips, of course, are complimentary.

The service was excellent, very friendly and quick to bring out the food,  The restaurant is spotless, very clean and welcoming.  If you're a taco fan, this is without a doubt some of the best Phoenix has to offer."}
{"text":"Food is just average. Nothing special. I would skip and go somewhere else. I had the pastor(pork), asada(steak), and cabeza(shredded head/cheek). The winner was definitely the cabeza. But everything else was just blande. The pastor was extremely dried. The owner asked me how it was and i told him my honest opinion; \"the pastor was extremely dried.\" His response \"you should know the pastor was going to be dried, next time put more lemon to soften it.\" Rude and just arrogant. Pastor is not supposed to be dried. Anyways... i live close by but it wont me my go to Mexican. Will rather got to El Pastorcito or Salsitas on 43rd and Indian School."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. The staff is friendly and the paintings on the walls are interesting to say the least. Take a closer look when you see them. The cost of food is very reasonable. Definitely try the shredded beef torta."}
{"text":"Very few time would I give 5 stars but this is one of the best authentic Mexican places I've been. We ordered 4 tacos off the top of their taco list and a burrito and they are amazing! Every single item is good! Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"There's nothing better than street tacos from a sketchy part of town. The carne asada is amazing and the birria tacos are fantastic. Fantastic! Warm corn tortillas, juicy meat, seasoned to your salsa preference. The salsa bar is slim but don't be deceived because it's absolutely delicious.Sooooo good! The chips are great and the charros are hands-down the best. These beans actually stand on their own they are so good. I think the secret is in the broth. But this isn't soup; its a hearty bean dish and its delicious. I didn't try the sushi but I have to admit I'm intrigued. But oh! The tacos!! Man I miss this place."}
{"text":"Feeling as though the quality is deteriorating. The past couple of times we've been here the service has been spotty. We were suddenly charged one dollar for refills when they used to do free refills. It was literally a change from one week to the other and the cashier was sort of rude about it. The carne asada tacos seem to be hit or miss and the shrimp tacos taste very different. A little disappointed  because this was my family's go to taco place."}
{"text":"Best little surprise. Had the small tacos which hit the spot and surprisingly the sushi was damn good. Who knew!?

The service was solid too."}
{"text":"Nothing spectacular but if you need a quick taco fix, they won't disappoint. Salsa bar offers all the fixings, so you essentially get your taco plain and top accordingly, which is my favorite method. Quality is good, again, nothing worth driving across town for, but great if you're in the area."}
{"text":"The taco combo I had was fantastic.   Love,  love the salsa bar!   All fresh salsas and Pico de gallo that is maintained constantly,  never old and warm like most unattended to salsa bars.  Prices are cheap and will be a long time customer.  Only drawback is,  no beer or wine."}
{"text":"Wow
Found this place on Yelp. No doubt the owner makes all the food. From the chips to the guac to the pineapple drink to the Tacos could not be happier. To bad there are not more locations in phx.
I will be back and will let all my friends and family know to check this place out.
So glad Yelp again didn't let me down.
I'm happy and full!"}
{"text":"Great customer service and food was delicious  Gonna be coming back more often to this place because of all different kinds of foods on the menu"}
{"text":"First timer turned loyal customer. The salsa bar is delicious and impressive. I had the ceviche tostada and 2 tacos with beans, served with chips for the salsa. The ceviche was good, but the tacos were amazing. I really enjoyed the shredded beef one the most, personally. The tortillas are homemade, both flour and corn - I tried both of those of course and they're both great, can't lose either way there. And the food being all that it was for me, the service was top notch too. The lady at the register greeted me when I came in and took the time to answer questions I had about deciding what to order. She even walked me through the aguas frescas, letting me have samples. Then a man came out, I think he may own the place, and he was very friendly. All in all, good people behind a great restaurant, I think it may truly be a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"\"Life without Mexican Food is like no life at all\" - Unknown --- that being said I come here about once a week, tripas! tripas! tripas! Sooo goood! Also, salsas"}
{"text":"I knew this place was legit when I noticed the beans had wieners in them. I recommend the taco plate. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best tacos I've had in such a long time! wish I could give them a higher rating (:  
Very authentic, great flavor, friendly and fast service. 
Did I mention they served fresh homemade corn tortillas?"}
{"text":"The best street tacos ever including Puerto Vallarta which I've been to a couple of times.  I had an carne asada, pastor and shrimp street taco in what must have been name made flour tortillas.  Nice selection of fresh salsas and garnishes. Home made Mexican fruit drinks. Clean as a whistle. Friendly service. Very inexpensive. No alcohol. Funky, authentic Mexican fare and ambience."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch, ordered the shrimp tacos. They were amazing and after eating 2 i felt like I could eat 100 more. Def lives up to the reviews for this place. Small, but so, so worth it. The chipotle sauce that comes with the shrimp tacos was the best part."}
{"text":"Ordered food to go in the last thirty minutes before close. Ordered four ceviche tostadas and were very nice, called back two minutes later to change it from two tostadas to two fish tacos and they said no problem. When we got there they were friendly and the place was clean and seem to have a few customers."}
{"text":"What a great place.  We were a little unsure when we saw it for the first time but yelp said it was good.   We had fajitas and burrito.  They were wonderful.  plenty of food and it was delicious.  I would definitely go back again"}
{"text":"Awesome! Awesome! Awesome! Loved this place! Great little spot, fresh salsa bar, fresh shrimp, good service."}
{"text":"Eat here at least once a week. Always amazing, great service, and they never mess up our order. Clean and great salsa as well."}
{"text":"Carne asada tacos were my favorite but I ordered a shrimp taco also and they gave me a barbacoa taco .They fixed it right away but I wasn't a fan of the shrimp taco but good prices and good food"}
{"text":"Wow, so good.   We ordered ceviche, the Kissi sushi roll, a taco combo with a mix of tacos, and hochata.   The service was fabulous, very helpful and attentive.  The tacos were great; the shredded beef being my favorite.  The salsas are flavorful.  The ceviche is classic and perfect.  The sushi was fun (although fried sushi is not my favorite sushi style, it was still good).  Their charro beans were great.  Even the horchata was impressive; obviously home-made.  I used to work in El Paso; the tacos and salsas here remind me of what I would get there.  It is surprisingly difficult to find really good tacos in Phoenix, so this is a gem.  Next time I will probably order all tacos, as they were really incredible.  Would be ideal for takeout. The atmosphere is really basic; this is a simple taco shop.  They put their energy into the food, not the decor.  Worth repeat visits."}
{"text":"This place has really good food. I got there when I am in Phoenix. I only gave it three stars because of their attitude last time. I will change my rating if they have better customer service next time. We called ahead so out order would be ready and the girl said it would be about ten minutes. so we show up and she looks very confused. they are looking around and and can't find our order. rather than just admitting they had misplaced our order they secretly went in the back and reordered it after they had asked again what we wanted so they could remember. after it had been fourty minutes and we were in a hurry we just wanted a refund. they said the food was ready and they had other people in front of us and Thalys why it took that long. she also had an attitude and said well I told you 15 to 30 minutes anyway and I simply said no it was 10 and my boyfriend heard as well. but it was fourth minutes anyway. the food still took 10 more minutes after that."}
{"text":"Tacos kissi, while a strange combination of foods, is wonderful.

The tacos are always fresh with great flavor, I love getting a different combination each time. The salsa bar, while not huge, is always well stocked with high-quality options. 

I'm much more a quantity over quality kind of guy, but these tacos always fill me up and leave me satisfied. One of my first choices."}
{"text":"Tried the four taco combo with beans. Excellent. Hard to pick a favorite meat. Not sure what additional meats are in the beans, but great flavor. Salsas make my head sweat, so they are perfectly hot."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!! In my home town we have a restaurant called El Palmar. They make their tortillas fresh & some of the best food I've ever tasted! No one has ever been able to compare to them in my opinion. I've gone to restaurant after restaurant & was never satisfied til now! I'll definitely be going back & trying everything on the menu. The salsa is also all amazing! The people that helped me were very polite & professional. Great food & great customer service! Two thumbs up!!!!"}
{"text":"Yummy!!!! I'm so glad we found this hole in the wall Mexican restaurant. I felt like I was in Mexico. We had quesadilla with just cheese, birria and carne asada tacos, elote and horchata. I may have over overordered but I get to eat the leftovers for breakfast tomorrow. The tortillas were home made, the cheese in the quesadilla were delicious.ill be back!"}
{"text":"Variety in their menu. Tacos to sushi. Complimentary chips and salsa was good. Sides could of been a little more plentiful but were tasty. Friendly service. Just missing something to give it a better rating. Good enough to return if i lived in the area but not to go out of my way to eat."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is great, but I just wish the flans were firmer. Its too creamy. You should add more eggs to your recipe in order to make it more firm. Thank you."}
{"text":"I was at the barber shop down the street on camelback and with all the carneserias around here I could smell the meat in the air so found this spot....my first time and not let down hard to come by a place that has \"Birria\" on point! Def a good spot"}
{"text":"One of my favorite place to eat lunch, everything is amazing and delicious,  I always get the Chicken Tacos, with a side of their delicious red homemade salsa/Hot sauce....I probably eat here 12 times a month, everything taste fresh and made right then and there"}
{"text":"Everything was excellent. I tried 4 different tacos and they were all great. Awesome salsa bar too."}
{"text":"I had to update my rating for this fabulous Mexican jewel of a restaurant ."}
{"text":"Came with my cousin, at first didn't expect much. We ordered tacos and all I got to say is wow. I ordered 2 more it was that good. Coming back for sure maybe tomorrow cause it was that good. Especially the young lady in the front she was very kind and awesome customer service. Will definitely be coming back here again"}
{"text":"The highlight, for me, was all the salsas. The taco plate was great, as was the chicken fajita burro. I will try some sushi in the future. If you do one thing - make sure to try the two hotter, orange/red salsas. The flavors are wonderful."}
{"text":"Great food! Not normally in this part of town, but glad I stumbled upon Tacos Kissi. A lot of menu items I wanted to try. Settled with lengua,  cabeza, carne asada, and al pastor tacos ( 1 each ). All very good! Salsa bar was great! Prices were decent!

Only thing that threw me off was the drinks. I was expecting a fountain drink and got a can of soda instead. Overall, I would go back ( with a 96oz thirstbuster )!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow! What a great little place for authentic and homemade Mexican food for an unbelievable price.  The tacos, burritos, ceviche all excellent.  We are from NY and found the place on Yelp as we like local fare versus the chains.  The owner was super nice and very welcoming and accommodating.  Definitely recommend this one!"}
{"text":"This mom & pop shop was a pleasant discovery!  Their asada tacos & burritos are marinated like no other taco stand or restaurant that we've dined; it's so tender and flavorful!  It's a wonderful neighborhood eatery that we will definitely revisit!"}
{"text":"Great costumer service. We had some sushi and ceviche, both were really good! I tried the ruby sushi roll which comes with fried rice and it was amazing. Recommended!"}
{"text":"Very authentic Mexican food ! Loved the salsa bar. They have a variety of Aguas Frescas and their tostadas were amazing ! I will definitely back to try more food on their menu!"}
{"text":"I'll be honest when I first saw the sign for this place and it stated Mexican sushi I was scared. But then we made the decision to try Tacos Kissi. They have now been around almost 4 years I think and they are amazing for street tacos, tostadas tortas, and Mexican sushi. We are big fans of this place there Carna Asada tacos are one of my favorite as well as their shredded beef tacos. They have ranch style beans that are so smoky and flavorful I get them every time in lieu of refried. Totally recommend this place great price great Food family owned and ran oh in a bonus they have awesome thrifty ice cream."}
{"text":"stopped here while driving through Arizona. Service was amazing - lady at the front explained all the food to us and offered suggestions. The flavored water was really good and not full of chemicals like some artificial ones. I had carne asada tacos and they were excellent. Free chips and a salsa bar to top it off. excellent!"}
{"text":"Visited this place last week and the tacos were delicious. I tried the carne asada and pastor. Both were delicious and the charro beans were perfecto! I also tried the piña agua fresca which I am very picky about and it was also delicious. The tortillas are made by hand which is a huge plus in my book. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Get that torta. Fresh bread. The best fries. Eat in so you can get the homemade chips. Make sure you pour the green sauce on the torta. Bomb! Sorry no pic. By the time I thought about Yelp, torta was gone."}
{"text":"If you are looking for authentic mexican in Phoenix this is the place for you! Fantastic tacos and plus you get the added salsa bar with plenty of fixins. They have about 6 salsas and sauces to have with your food and all were really good. The birria and al pastor were the best taco I had, but all were pretty good. I would highly recommend this place for lunch or a quick dinner."}
{"text":"kissi rolls =  thumbs up tacos = thumbs down
kissi rolls were great! tacos had gristle and even a chunk of bone in them - gross!"}
{"text":"Im here atleast once a week! The carne asada tacos on flour and the ruby roll are always on point. Restaurant is always clean and service is prompt. Definitely my favorite spot for tacos and the only place Ive ever liked mexican sushi!"}
{"text":"I would have gave it 4 3/4 star's but, the option wasn't available. The Asada tacos were good and so were the Cabeza tacos. The salsa bar was fresh and delicious and so was the Rubi sushi roll. I will definitely be coming back. The restaurant was also nice and clean the the workers were super friendly."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for. Reason I gave 4 stars instead of 3 is because service was great. Food was pretty good. I got an al pastor burrito but think I would try tacos or a tostada next time. My mom got a tostada and she said it was really good, it looked good! Overall, decent food for cheap prices. Being a GCU student, I'll probably be back."}
{"text":"I went to Tacos Kissi because my boyfriend had gone and told me that they were pretty good. Plus, they had \"Mexican sushi\" and he wanted to try that. They had several different kinds of sushi (probably 10 different ones), but they all were fried and had cream cheese.  I don't remember which one we got, but I remember that it was kind of greasy and had too, too much cream cheese. I didn't like it and would not order the \"Mexican sushi\" again. I really have no idea what even made it Mexican.  No salsa. No jalapenos. Nothing Mexicany about it.
I also ordered a carne asada torta, which was pretty average, but still delicious.  I would definitely go back, but not for the sushi."}
{"text":"Found this last second as a place to eat for lunch. The food was Excellent. I love the salsa bar they have. The horchata was fresh and not too sweet. I wish the place was by me. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"I love supporting local. This place is as local as it gets! Please go. Amazingly fresh food, ice-cream for the kids (or you), clean, friendly! Yes, just yes! 

I tried the asada, chicken fajita, and shrimp tacos. Delicious! The tortillas are fresh made, the meat is seasoned to perfection. Loved the salsa bar! Great little hole in the wall. Will be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in after vaping.  Great Authentic Tacos, big menu, reasonable prices, great service...family ran small business.  The food is fantastic."}
{"text":"Got two Chicken Fajita Tacos and one shrimp. Im a taco lover so my views on tacos are very critical. 

Very authentic tacos, full condiment bar and nachos to come with.

Only reason I gave 4 stars is because there was a fly that kept bothering me for my lime!"}
{"text":"Lunch time visit with friends and it was a hit. Although we thought the sushi rolls were a bit on the expensive side, they were delicious. Also ordered the tostadas one with chicken and the other shrimp cerviche. Yum to all, fresh food and good clean service. On the keep be back list."}
{"text":"I love this little hole in the wall! Their fresh juices are amazing and oh so yummy, and their carne asada is delicious. The service here is great, and the food is always consistent. It has been a little while since I lived in Phoenix but I was sitting at my office in LA thinking how much I would love some Tacos Kissi carne asada and some fresh juice! Their location is not great, but give this place a try, you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Best taco place in town.
Love their tacos. Love their torta. Chips is great. The salsa bar is worth a million!!!!"}
{"text":"Worth the 30 min drive! Such a variety to chose from! Mexican sushi was the bomb.com! We also
Ordered tacos and French fries. This place hits the spot! Thrifty ice cream is here as well! There was a man at the bus stop right in front of the restaurant, he was sweating and asked for water. The owner gave him a scoop of ice cream to cool him off. Human kindness at its best. I support this establishment and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Amazing! Everything taste soooo authentic just like in Mexico. Salsa is fresh spicy and perfect! Free chips soooo crunchy and yummy.  I love love their shrimp cocktail and ceviche so fresh so cheap and flavorful. I love how they have many option to choose from . Hands down best taco shop in phx! :)"}
{"text":"Looooove this place. 

I get the chicken boy roll, so good. They're pretty quick in getting it out to you, especially with how long it might take to make the roll. 

Also their chicken tacos are amazing. The green sauce is the best.  

I love coming here, staff is friendly. The decorations are unusual but interesting. 

It sounds random, Mexican food and sushi but a great mix."}
{"text":"SO. GOOD. 
The carne asada fries were delicious, and the people were so friendly.
Don't let the exterior deter you, it's probably the greatest find in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"So last night was my first visit to Tacos Kissi. I ordered the carne asada tacos and the Kissi Roll. I can't tell you how good these tacos where!  I've had a lot of street tacos at many different restaurants around town and these are the best! These tacos are a little larger than average street tacos you get at most restaurants and not only are they generous with the meat but it is seasoned soo well. I liked the fact that you get your choice of corn or flour tortillas, I chose the flour, and I'm sure they are homemade. They also have a fresh salsa bar with several choices (I recommend the tomatillo) as well as fresh cilantro, onion and cabbage. The Kissi Roll was also very good, not as good as the tacos but on a scale of 1-10 I would rate the roll a 7. Very reasonable prices and the restaurant itself is extremely clean and tidy. Needless to say I went back for a second visit today. ;)"}
{"text":"my go to mexican restaurant now!  inexpensive and delicious!  everything is very fresh and well prepared.  I typically get the chicken taco with their homemade tortilla, the bean tostada, and the ceviche tostada.  their ceviche is the best I have had in the city.  not to mention their salsa is always fresh, a little hot, and very good with the free chips.  ummmmm!!!"}
{"text":"I got the kissi rolls, different but definitely good. Also the carne asada fries. Fries weren't a big proportion like other restaurants but we're definitely alot better quality ingredients and carne asada was cooked to order rather than left under a lamp. The restaurant was clean and the family that runs the place are very nice. Great customer service, I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I used to be a huge fan of Tacos Kissi when they opened. I brought so many friends ti try their food because I thought is conveniently located, decently priced and the variety of food is just amazing! 

I swear if i was more into yelp in those days i would have check in every time i visited and i would have been won a crown! I have been here a numerous amount of times, enough to say that the quality of food has gone down hill in a spam of a few months. 

I have order all their meat tacos, their chilaquines, their hamburgers, their hamburgers (they literally have ham in there; they way they make it in some parts of mexico) their sushi, their nachos, their carne asada fries, their charro beans, hot do combos. and other items i cant recall. I have ordered some of these items at least TWICE. I have ordered all the susi rolls in the menu... And the quality now is just not the one I once bragged about. 

When I began to come here it was only a few people said to all be family, now is newer staff and the seasoning among the staff is so different. 

For starters the kissi sushi roll (was my favorite) had equal amount of shrimp veggies and rice. Now is mostly rice and less shrimp.. Very disappointing because they were my go-to place. i would call ahead and pick up my order. 

Now the customer service is always the highlight of my day. They are great and so friendly. 

Now the main reason i will still be coming here is because they have tasty tasty chilaquines, by far the only thing left in the menu that i can still recommend until further notice. They mix a few different sauces and it gives the food a unique taste, reminding me of my home."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service, can't go wrong with anything on the menu, best us the El Pastor"}
{"text":"My daughter was wanting carne asada fries, and this guy delivered! Great service and great food, treated us like family from out of town. The place didn't look like much from outside, but once you cone in the door it's a different experience."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Friendly people and good service. Live pretty far away but would make the drive again in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"This place is very deserving of its 4.5 Yelp rating.  The wife and I had carne asada and pastor tacos. The pastor was so good we bought a burrito for later.  The carne asada is on par with some of the other popular taco joints around town. It's the pastor that sets it apart from the others, it's easily the best I've around town.  The salsa bar has all the necessities,  the pico had a fresh and clean taste. I also had jamaica (hibiscus punch) to drink,  it's the best I've had outside of Mexico.  The staff was very friendly.  We will definitely be adding Tacos Kissi to the regular rotation."}
{"text":"The tacos were great and the service was too they don't speak much English but what good taco shop ever does"}
{"text":"I don't know if the people who have reviewed this place are actually friends/family members of the owners .... I just don't understand why my experience was so different than the other 94 reviews I read that brought me here in the first place. I spent $30 for two people. This included 4 street tacos (so incredibly tiny, two should truly be one), two tostada ceviche, and 1 Mexican sushi roll (each $9.99).

I enjoyed the tostada, should have just ordered 3 of them and called it a day. It wasn't the best but it was adequate for the price or maybe just so much more enjoyable then the other items we selected.

The sushi Mexican roll, although very creative, tasted like a grease roll and I was not a fan despite all the raving reviews. It isn't sushi at all. It is a roll but they should really call it something else. I was expecting sushi ... that was not sushi. The tacos were raved about in other reviews, I wasn't impressed. The place is a semi bad area of town, that doesn't bother me, its a walk up to counter and order, that doesn't bother me ... it was just the food that bothered me. 

I tried it once, won't be back. It just wasn't satisfying. I am the first person to praise any little non-commercialized business but just not this place."}
{"text":"Absolutely the BEST!!!! I Seriously come here all the time, at least twice a week. This is in no way a hit-or-miss kind of place, there food is consistently delicious. 

Being from Mexico (Baja), I am incredibly picky when it comes to tacos... I moved here back in the summer of '05 and this is the only place in all of Arizona where the tacos, from the taste of the meat to the wonderful salsas, taste just like the ones from back home. 

When you dine in, they always bring you some free chips, and there salsa bar has a great variety of yummy topping to throw on their already yummy food. 

And guess what? If you're a sushi fan, I have had two different rolls so far and they are both AMAZING! 

Besides all the culinary masterpieces, the family that owns this small business are the most kindhearted and hard-working people I have ever met. Go and you will not be disappointed. 

A mis amigos hispanos: Si quieren unos tacos como los de casa, las mejores salsas, y el mejor servicio, TIENEN QUE IR! Despues de comer en Tacos Kissi, preparense para los antojos todos los dias!! Jajaja..."}
{"text":"I have lived a half mile away for almost a year...I have been missing out on this hidden gem! Went in today and ordered the tacocombo and asada fries. 

The tacocombo includes four tacos, charro beans, plenty of onion and cilantro and a drink. They allow you to get different meat options for the tacos. You can also choose flour or corn tortillas. I picked chicken fajita, shredded beef and two asada tacos all on flour tortillas. The chicken fajita was all white meat and seasoned well, not dry. It did not include any veggies, but did not disappoint. The shredded beef was a generous portion of juicy beef. The asada was my favorite. It was seasoned well and it was meat, not fat and gristle. The beans were amazing, flavorful and included bits of bacon. Even the drink was delicious. They offer a variety of aguas frescas. I went with limonada or limeaide and it was the perfect balance of sweet,  tangy and refreshing, not at all bitter which can easily happen if this drink is not prepared correctly. 

The asada fries were good, a bit salty and not as generously portioned as I'm used to. However, the fact that they use seasoned fries made up for the size. The same delicious asada meat is included as well as lots of cheese, sour  cream and green salsa which is a delicious avocado based salsa. 

They also have a delicious salsa bar, we added Pico de gallo to everything, pretty standard but good. I also opted for a molcajete salsa which was very flavorful, not too spicy.

I'm so glad I went in this afternoon. I seriously considered going in for more tacos for dinner tonight. It's that good...and I have to make up for lost time. Try this place, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I stopped in here on a whim after reading so many good reviews. So glad i did! All of the food is amazing, ive been here a dozen or so times and have tried everything. Watermelon juice is so delicious and get it every time i go.  The Kissi roll is awesome, served warm with wonderful  orange sauce. Took my family in today and everyone loved their food. My grandmother feel in love with their  hottest salsa and was drinking it down - no joke. She convinced  the owner to sell her a pint. The place is awesome and very affordable."}
{"text":"On point, hands down just good food and great service.  Have not tried the sushi but everything g else is legit.  Recommend


The tostada I highly recommend!!! Extra cheese and sour cream.  Go big or go home"}
{"text":"Fantastic! I don't understand how this place isn't bangin' with a line out the door. Sushi, great flavors but I really got to agree with the other reviewer when she said she hasn't had tacos this good out of Mexico. Neither have I, and man have I been chasing that flavor. Carne Asada baby, with a side of sushi. Sounds gross? Oh no, its sooooo good. Damn!"}
{"text":"Cute name. Excellent food. What more do you want? You go in there see the menu, see the picture, ask for any extra on your order they'll do it. It's a place you go in and eat. Clean."}
{"text":"Small family owned restaurant that serves delicious tacos and bomb bomb bomb sushi rolls i honestly didn't think they would b all that but they were. 
Friendly staff. Good prices ill be back soon"}
{"text":"Good service like always not complains at all so far 
Very clean place food is very good and we manage to get an special order in which is not in the menu"}
{"text":"Best street taco! Family owned and super friendly."}
{"text":"Love trying different Mexican restaurants and I am very pleased with this one. My husband and I tried the tostada de ceviche, chalchipapas, two tacos (asada and pastor) and had watermelon drink (agua de sandia), everything was delicious. They have a salsa bar which is the key to have in every Mexican restaurant in my opinion. Plenty of options. Next time we come we want to try their sushi."}
{"text":"Estilo Mexicano Sushi...TAKE THAT TRUMP....that's right gueros and gueras....Mexican style SUSHI. It's every bit as delicious as it sounds, the co-mingling of two wonderful food cultures produces another gorgeous mixed child of love! #lovekillsthedemon Just try it already, it's delicious. I'm a huge fan of agua fresas if they're done right and they scoop some chunky pineapple water made with love to wash down even the spiciest of their awesome street tacos, which you can get with flour tortillas if you're so inclined. The Al Pastor and shrimp tacos are my favorites here but they all look good. If you are a huge fan of the Sonoran Dog as I am, you will not be disappointed. The thing that most impressed me was the coconut pineapple ice cream. I was transported back to The mid to late 90s, when I was in my mid to late 20s and eating my way up and down the streets of Acapulco and Mazatlan. Seriously people, street vendor quality creaminess with chunks of fresh fruit! Give this place a shot, not all Taquerias are built alike. This ain't no \"Berto's\" and that ain't no bull!"}
{"text":"The best tacos in all of Phoenix! Shhh don't tell anyone about the best kept secret! What ever they put in these tacos is addicting!"}
{"text":"Seriously this is such a good place.  The shrimp cocktail is very fresh tasting. The carne Asada tacos and al pastor tacos are GREAT! The service is fast and friendly.. my new spot. Just wish they were open late night."}
{"text":"Secret Gem. 

This is a great authentic Mexican place in phoenix.

Its doesn't look impressive on the outside and the area its in is questionable, but don't let that stop you.

The food and the service here are great.   If you want ACTUAL Mexican food come here.

Don't bother with on the boarder, chili's, or whatever Scottsdale is trying to tell you is good."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos!! They're staff is very friendly and the food comes out quick, even with big groups. Their taco bar is always fresh and the place is very clean."}
{"text":"Loved it! The asada and pastor was on point! Tortillas were fresh and authentic. Salsas were great! I also had a Kissi roll and that was bomb! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Small family owned and operated serving Mexican Sushi and tacos.

The place can get busy and usually has a small staff resulting in a wait. We usually call in for take-out to avoid the wait. We have had the sushi, Mar Y Tierra and the Kissi Rolls, Carne Asada plate, and Mexican hotdog. The Mar y Tierra roll and salsa bar are highlights."}
{"text":"Great little hole in the wall, which is what we were looking for. Despite myself coming in like a bull in a china shop - spilling my salsa on the floor, and dropping the box that contains all the salsa cups for customers - the owner was awesome and just smiled. The food was great! Great meals, $1.50 street tacos, desserts.. Def recommend and will be back for more! Hopefully I wont take anything down this time..."}
{"text":"Drove by this place on multiple occasions, so glad I decided to finally stop. The fresas con creama reminded me of my Mom's but with coconut, chopped nuts and whipped cream topping....sooooo good. 
I had the Tacos platter with six different taco meats. All were good. The al pastor was my favorite."}
{"text":"I loooove this place! Sushi is good wish they would create some without cream cheese sometimes it could be too much.. anyways I've tried everything else it's the bomb! Legit Mexican food y'all!"}
{"text":"All taco enthusiast need to come here. Probably one of the best tacos I've had in phoenix since I moved from Los Angeles.  This is a literal hole in the wall do not expect a fancy sit down restaurant. That's what I love about it. It gives you the whole \"street taco\" experience. 

They have a huge variety of Mexican food here including Mexican sushi. Which I am not very excited about that lol. But their tacos definitely keep me coming. Customer service is excellent as well. They also have family meals which come in handy if you want to have a meal to share with your group. 

Bonus point they also serve thrifty ice cream soooooo I mean how much better can it get? 

It is pretty small place and it can get pretty packed, but most of the time people take it to go. Parking is a little tight, but not too bad. Overall a taco shop you have to try at least once."}
{"text":"Came all the way from Socal to hopefully watch the Rams beat the Cardinals tomorrow.  

Glad we found this place on yelp. We ordered the asada plate, asada and pastor tacos, birria, chicken quesadilla and Mexican sushi roll. The meats are very flavorful and the house sauce is amazing.  The combination of asada/fried rice/sushi works really well. Definitely one of the best mexican food my family has had.

Drinks wise, we had the limon, pina and of course the bottled coke. Can't beat good ole pina

The male cashier and the lady who brought us the food are very friendly.

The family and I will definitely drop by again when in the Phoenix/Glendale area"}
{"text":"This taco shop is great. I really enjoyed coming here it tasted great and they were very friendly! Looks pretty small on the outside but when you get in, there was a dencent amount of room. The tacos were pretty small for the price and not a lot of meat. I think ill try the Al pastor next time instead of the Asada, maybe it will be a better hit. But still great place to try and will be back!"}
{"text":"Came in wanting a quick burrito, but left feeling like a total glutton and loving it. Kissi is a lovely, unassuming, and inexpensive spot that's the real deal and then some. All that and a bag of chips. Not just a Mexican spot, but...a sushi place!?

Yes. Absolutely. Mexican sushi is a cool new trend that bastardizes Japanese food even better than America does, often incorporating ingredients like grilled chicken and carne asada into a tempura roll. Some are a bit more traditional. My dining companion and I had a pastor burrito and the Ruby Roll, with cream cheese, crab, and shrimp tempura. 

The burrito: I really prefer al pastor to lean on the sweet side, but I can admit that it was made pretty well here despite being salty. Some restaurants pair theirs with roasted onions and peppers, but Kissi stuck with beans (very good frijoles that don't overwhelm or act as cheap filler) and guac, which was surprisingly good. They warned me the salsas I chose (get the freaking tomatillo) were spicy, and it was no lie. I could barely handle them, and I can probably take more spice than you. Tread lightly. 

The sushi: OMG OMG OMG I don't care if it was basically a dressed up California roll, this is an experience you NEED to have. Each piece was HUGE. Like, too big for anyone to handle in one bite, and meant to be consumed with a fork. There are ten for $10 and I would struggle to finish it. I am an eel sauce fiend, so it was great being handed my own bottle of the stuff as well as spicy mayo and soy sauce to use at my disposal. Gosh I hate having to ask for extra everywhere else! Average sushi invites you to show restraint, admire beauty, and enjoy the atmosphere. This sushi leads you to believe all aesthetics are lies, and true happiness is a big appetite...as well as finishing the side of crab by scooping it with tortilla chips and smothering it in your seemingly infinite supply of Japanese condiments. 

Don't you dare judge me, I'm gonna go back and do this again like 20 times. 

Can you tell I really enjoyed this place?"}
{"text":"I've been going on the west side of town every month but didn't realize Taco Kissi was there until I started Yelpin to find out what's good. Never thought about eating around here cause of the area but what the heck. I'll try anything. 

This is a small little taco shop. Very unassuming. I walk in and there is no atmosphere. Bunch of tables with a counter and the menu above. Got a little confused when I first walked in but decided to order the two asada tacos and two pastor tacos with a side of guacamole. Kept on looking for a side of chips but they didn't have it. Oh well. I just got a glass of water and they pull out a plastic up full with ice and pour the water from a water container. Then she tells me they'll bring my water with a bowl of chips. Sweet. Free chips. Nice way to start my meal

Got my water and chips right away and they have a salsa bar with three salsa, pico, cabbage, cucumbers, and lime. Could decide which salsa so I pick the dark and darker salsa. What the heck. 

I got my tacos right away and I look at them and I said is that all. Looked so small but after eating everyone I was content. 

The asada tacos where so good. I added cabbage, guacamole, and salsa. So good. Really good. Cooked perfect. Juicy. Very flavorful. The guacamole made the taco. Big chunks of guacamole, fresh tomatoes, and fresh cilantro. Oh my goodness. The salsa added that heat. It was out of this world. So good. The pastor tacos were just as good. 

Oh yea the chips were very fresh. Very crispy just how I like it. Dip it in the guacamole and it was so darn good. The salsa just just as good. One was hot and the other really hot. 

So this place is really good. One of the best tacos shops I've had in the valley. Great tacos. Really good service. Friendly service. The ambience. Let's just say Spanish music playing. A majority of the people are speaking Spanish. Oh yea. It was very clean

Would I come back again. Of course but only during the day time. Got to be careful. Probably take out for my family too. Don't let that scare you. It's my taco heaven right now. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Don't judge a book by its cover! This place is amazing and the prices are more than fair. We ordered take out for a 15 person team lunch and everyone loved their meal! We did tacos, quesadillas, burritos, combo plates, even the sushi, all was amazing! The meats and beans were flavorful, and the rice was fluffy, salsa bar on point. Can't say enough good things!"}
{"text":"Mexican Sushi? Yeah, it's a weird thought ... but don't let that steer you the wrong way!

Although, I didn't come here for the Mexican Sushi that's so popular I got an order of Carne Asada fries because I haven't had any that are on par with the famous San Jose Iguana's or La Victoria Nacho Fries here. Looking for the next best thing I suppose.

The shop is small, but with ample seating and serves tacos, shrimp cocktail, mexican sushi, dessert and of course carne asada fries. For drinks they have the aguas frescas and soda. Adorned all over the register are small snacks and candies, many of which I grew up eating like De La Rosa Marzipan, Vero Mango, Lucas, all the spicy Tamarindo types and pinwheel chips.

I ordered the Carne Asada Fries and Horchata for about $9, not bad for a large lunch. The fries aren't typical fast food fries and have that little battered type texture around the fries, meat is a bit small in portion. The sour cream and guacamole were scooped neatly on top. A bit plain in my opinion so I topped it with pico de gallo, lime, tomatillo salsa, jalapenos and that spicy mayo that comes on the side of their Mexican sushi. It was good, but nothing mind blowing. Their salsa bar is pretty good, definitely one of the better tomatillo salsa's I've had here. Still definitely better than Filiberto's Carne Asada fries that's for sure! Horchata was good, not too sweet but not the best Horchata I've had in PHX. Definitely needs a little more cinnamon, however still good and you can tell it was made fresh.

The shop is clean, big and the staff is friendly and fast. The only con is that the parking lot is limited and it's on a main road, so dining here during rush hour can be a struggle."}
{"text":"This place intrigues me.  The reason I first went was because of the blaring \"Mexican Sushi\" sign.  And I was hungry.  And hot.

The first time I actually didn't try a sushi roll (tight on cash...blame teachers' salaries).  I enjoyed some shrimp tacos (limited options for a pescatarian, unfortunately) and a cup of elote!  It was delicious.  Lots of salsas at the condiment bar, too.

The second time I did order some sushi, though I forget which roll.  I also had a cocktail de camaron, which was super yum.  The sushi was OK.  I didn't see how it was \"Mexican,\" though it was fried and a little heavy on the cream cheese.  I'd like to try another.  Next time.  

Service, over the course of two visits, was fine.  They took my order and brought my food to the table.  That's about as far as it went.  Price is pretty good, too.  A dollar or two less would be nice, but as is is totally fair :)

Environment is almost nil.  There are neutral colored walls and floors with relatively nondescript seating.  The one thing that does stand out is the counter of Mexican candies next to the cash register.

This place is a mile away, so next time it's not over 90 and I have some money, I'll hit them up again."}
{"text":"Have the Kearny Asada it tasted great would definitely recommend to all my family and friends"}
{"text":"This was pretty tasty. Their shrimp tacos were delicious.  Loved the goodie bar with salsa, hot carrots and other topping items. The shrimp civiche wasn't great, but it won't hold me back from trying their other dishes. I'll be back."}
{"text":"You know the real deal when you experience it. After eating here once, I can tell you Tacos Kissi is the real deal. This afternoon, I had the carne asada fries - the best I have ever had. The entire restaurant was packed and the customer service was on point. They give you tortilla chips to eat while they prepare your order fresh and provide access to a salsa bar. The spicy red salsa was the standout when paired with the carne asada fries. Highly recommend if you have never been and are looking for a phenomenal local Mexican spot."}
{"text":"Nice people.  Probably good tacos etc. salsa and other sauces were not hot.  Nothing special.  Really horrid fake sushi.  Greasy and old stinky shrimp.  Had to try it just for fun.  Not fun.  Small portions.  Quesadilla with chicken just usual.  Overall not worth it.  Better places for Americanized Mexican food.  Sorry."}
{"text":"Fast food take out feel with a few tables. .  I was worried when I saw sushi on the board. Ordered chicken tacos and carne asada tacos. Both delicious. Fundamentals: salsa, beans, guacamole,  chips ALL tasty. Kinda a sketchy looking neighborhood. Service very friendly. Clean."}
{"text":"So I went to a Mexican restaurant for sushi. Don't judge me. Where else was I going to get a roll called Mar y Tierra with steak and shrimp.

I must have sat and looked at that menu forever, but it was hard to decide. They have this roll called the Kissi roll which seems to be popular. I'll have to go back to try it. And then maybe one day I'll actually try their Mexican food. I heard that pretty good too."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place after seeing the reviews. However I was thoroughly disappointed! My service and food was awful. Maybe they were just having an \"off day\" ? but I will not be going back"}
{"text":"Food was fine but the restaurant is not very clean and the staff is not very friendly"}
{"text":"Driving through Phoenix and stopped at this place I saw on Yelp with great reviews and had to experience for myself. Had an incredible experience that floored me. The food was great met the owners and they were great, definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"My husband liked going there for the shrimp cocktail. And everything was fine till last week when he ordered. This time he got sick, he was throwing up had a fever. It was the only thing that he ate different from the whole family, so this place had to of been the place that made him sick! So if you plan on visiting this establishment, I'd be careful!!!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious!!! Low key, nice staff and wonderful homemade food. It's a great blend between sushi and tacos, what more could you want?"}
{"text":"Still amazing and everything so fresh tasting. Get a 20 oz bean to-go and add some cilantro, onion from salsa bar then go home and add precooked shrimp. Heat in microwave 2minutes and you have amazing soup. Lol"}
{"text":"The Jimmi rolls are AMAZING!!!! I always want to try other things but can't pass these up.  The staff is always friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"I remember passing this place one day, and wondering 'what the heck is Mexican sushi?' I'm a huge sushi fanatic, so I was curious. It's different from the traditional sushi I am used to, but I love it.I always get the same roll and it's the kissi roll. It's like shimp tempura, but everything is fried and there's cream cheese in it. It's very good, and super fulfilling. And so cheap because you get huge pieces.

As the Mexico food, ahhhhhh. I love it, too. You start with complimentary chips and salsa, while waiting for your food to come. I usually order the same thing when I come here (I've been here numerous times), the carne asada fries. Hands down best ones I've tried. My boyfriend usually get the tacos, and the tortillas are hand-made so you know those are good. :) Their horchata is also tasty :)

Their customer service is good, too. We've gotten great service and sometimes they give us discounts and free stuff, too :)"}

{"text":"This is my fave place to get by Mexican sushi. We always get a sushi roll and pair it with their carne Asada fries which are also my absolute fave. They don't make them like your typical \"bertos\" place-no- these are definitely different and a must try if you stop by."}
{"text":"Amazing! Not only the nicest people, but the sushi and tacos are seriously incredible. The fact that you can get amazing sushi and tacos from the same place is awesome. Fresh salsa bar loaded with so many delicious options (seriously, try them all). Get a churro and horchata as well, thank me later!!!"}
{"text":"If I could give 10 stars I truly would , smaller restaurant but the food is amazing !! They have a amazing salsa bar that alwayss has fresh ingredients! The green salsa is to die for . I have found out that my favorite order is 2 fish tacos and a kissi roll ! Yes I eat that all by myself , and would everyday if I could. I live in el mirage , so it's about a 30 minute drive for me but worth every minute when eating there ! Their carne asada is amazing and pretty much everything on menu . I will include that their customer service is awsome as well . 10 stars for me ! Thank you for the amazing food ! Don't change it up , you guys have it on point !"}
{"text":"I arrived here about 6:30 or so on a Sunday evening and was starving. Not sure if I wanted Mexican or sushi, so I decided to give this place a try. I have never had Mexican sushi before, so wasn't quite sure what to expect. I ordered a very large order: a pierna torta ($6 and change) a shredded beef tostada ($3) and a Kissi roll ($9) I was asked if it was for there or go to. When I said here he warned me that it was a lot of food. That was really nice of him, since most places would be like \"score... ordered lots of food and ain't gonna eat half of it' It shows they care about the customer. I did still continue that order. Came out to $20 even after tax (before tip) I then proceeded to the salsa bar to get some pico de gallo, and three different types of salsa to have with their chips. The pico was amazing, and the green and red were both very flavorful. The brown was flavorful too, just a bit spicy. The chips were delicous.... crunchy but still soft.... i do believe they are homemade. My tostada arrived first, fully loaded with goodness. It was huge! Just after the tostada I was starting to fill up fast. My torta arrived before I was able to finish the tostada and came with some fries. I ate about half of it and knew that I was in danger of not having any room to try the sushi. The torta was good, but I probably wouldn't get it again simply because I think the tostada was better. My sushi arrived and I was only able to eat 3 bites of it before I was full. Those three bites were amazing tho! I highly recommend this place.... Even though the rolls are $9, it is technically 2 rolls.... it is 12 pieces. Very large pieces. And it also comes with some crab salad on the side and a bottle of spicy mayo and a sort of teriyaki sauce for you to put on top and customize. This place is all about giving you custom food and at a fairly decent price. They are very kind and even tho the place looks a bit run down from the outside, is nice. Next time I will probably just get the roll and a tostada and maybe try a taco."}
{"text":"Tacos Kissi is owned and operated by the Kissi family.  Ruby is the cook and her son Jaime is the front of house.  Best mexican I have had in a long long time.  Damn it's good. Fresh salsa and amazing tripas, carne, al pastor, lengua, and everything else.  Haven't tried the sushi.  I have been here 10 times this week no joke.  The torts combo with fries is buy bueno.  I mean exceptionally good for $7 and change.  Love it."}
{"text":"Pretty much a regular - lots of options - interesting sushi plates, great tacos! My whole family comes and everyone loves the food here!"}
{"text":"Do not skip over this place! I'm a GCU student and saw the sign for the place on the way to school for years, and didn't stop in until recently. Let me tell you, that was a HUGE loss on my end. This place has some of the best tacos I've ever had. The Asada, and Pastor are absolutely amazing, and the sushi here is pretty good too! Also, the Horchata is absolutely delicious. When I crave tacos, this is the place you'll find me :)"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service!! Genuine good people. The food is amazing with tons of flavor!! Prices are great. The best tripa tacos I've had in a while. Salsas are delicious and not watered down. I'll be back !!"}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time. It was valentines day so it was a lil busy when we got there.  The younger gentleman at the counter was looking and acting a little stressed out, so my first impression wasn't a good one.  However i ordered and when the food came out it made up for the poor start. I had the tacos platter. I picked carne asada, pastor, and tripas and  they all were delicious. i also ordered a kissi roll which was very good. something slightly different than average sushi but really really good. the portions were good too, especially the kissi roll. i ate the whole plate but id say it would be a dish better shared. (I got a large appetite ). There was also a young lady helping us who was really nice. all in all a good experience. i will definitely be back to try some other stuff on the menu. if the tripas stay good they'll have my business for quite awhile."}
{"text":"i love this place the tacos are cheap delicious andthe meat flavorful and moist, and its one of the few places that has a nice variety of meat from cabeza,birria (my personal fav) and fried tripas which i usually hate but love here. the salsas are also super tasty never overpowering . only thing i will say is if you care about the ambience this place doesnt have alot but the foods so good you wont even notice as long as you have good company
p.s the sushi is awesome try the kissi roll you wont regret it"}
{"text":"The tacos are good. We tried pastor, carne asada and shredded beef. The best was the carne asada. Pastor is below average. 

Everything was good but nothing stood out. Salsa bar is as great as everyone reports. 

We sat for some time after our order just waiting for drinks."}
{"text":"Wow best taco place so far me and my friends enjoyed so much the food was super good definitely looking forward to come back next time we visit Phoenix !"}
{"text":"Stopped by here when I was looking for a good take out spot (thank you yelp!).

You really cannot go wrong with any of the Tacos (and they are pretty cheap). Very flavorful.

Good food and low cost, gives this place a 5 in my book."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. Shrimp tacos delicious. Right down the street for the Cathedral."}
{"text":"ok so first off, the hell with all of the bad reviews. they can all suck a dick. this place is amazing and the people are nice. normal people with great food. these mexican sushi rolls blow my mind. try them. get back to me: because you won't find anything close to it. at first I was like \"mexican sushi? wtf, that's insane!\" but then when that sushi touched my lips, I was enveloped in an aura of euphoria and happiness. I felt like a kid again. my fears and anxieties washed away. I could walk again. I was in a wheel chair and eating here cured my disabilities. no joke. check this place out."}
{"text":"I don't often give 5-star reviews.  Most are fake or done by  morons with no balls who never say anything bad.  But this place is a 5 star. I drive by this place all the time but didn't want to go in as most small Mexican food places can kill you!  But here it is. The good points:
1.  Gets 4.5 stars from yelp.  That doesn't always mean much.  (There are plenty of 4 star Mexican places that get an F by the health dept).  
2.  Health dept is  A rated all the way through..
3. Went in the place is spotless.  I mean spotless.
4.  It is late Sunday night when most of these places are empty.  This place was packed with customers.  And I don't mean white people snow birds, but real Mexicans--a good sign. Illegals know where to eat.
5.  I called the order in first and the person who answered the phone could speak English.
Try that somewhere else.  LOL.
6.  Food was great.  The Mexican sushi was strange but good.  Burrito was very good--better quality  meat than the \"bertos\" chain.
NO cheap food here.  Sushi and burrito came to $18, but any restaurant with a fancy building would charge more.  You really need to try this place & takeout is simple and easy."}
{"text":"AMAZING. how had I not heard of this little gem? Looks tiny from the outside but is actually pretty spacious. Everything we had was top notch. Their quesadilla is worth trying as it's a bit different than other places & the best I've had. Gf said the shrimp taco is the best she's had. Seriously great"}
{"text":"Good low prices! Carne asada is a bit off sometimes. Love the  birria, pastor, and beef tostadas. Had a hot dog and it was yucky, bacon was not cooked. Never tried the sushi doesn't seem natural there lol.."}
{"text":"Wow!!! I love this place !! I'm very sad that it's not close to home.. We stayed in a close by hotel and of course I found this restaurant on Yelp and I'm very happy I did.. 

We ordered tacos de asada, Del pastor and shrimp .. My husband got a sope de chorizo ... We got a watermelon agua Fresca and guess what ??? They have our favorite ice cream!!! Thrifty ice cream is the best !!! 

The food was sooooooooooooo delicious .. It makes me so sad that it's so far away from home.."}
