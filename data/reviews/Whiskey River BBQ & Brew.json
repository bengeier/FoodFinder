{"text":"Good food.. the brisket sandwich is delicious with their homemade apple BBQ sauce.. decent home brew. Gotta try the all beef ribs non Saturday!"}
{"text":"I ate lunch there on a Saturday while the wife was getting her hair done next door. It was early so there was barely anyone there. On the other hand, it was nice as I got to meet one of the partners, Scott. He was a real nice guy. I told him my background and what I do for a living (Food Service Equipment Engineer). He said their Fish Frys on Fridays are their big events. He said sometimes it will go into a three hour wait. I was surprised and shocked by that but am looking forward to going back to see if it is true. 

All of their meat is smoked onsite from raw. I had the pulled pork sandwich and my wife later ordered one of the entree salads. The salad was HUGE and they only used head lettuce, which I am personally not a fan of these days. My sandwich and sides we great as was the bbq sauce, which is brought seperately (a way to see if it is a true bbq joint of not). I would go there again...but is not a high brow establishment. Just good and simple food at reasonable prices.

{"text":"Round House Cafe???  Is this another attempt to \"re-brand\" another failed venture?  I am not attempting to extort this business for money, nor would I accept anything free from it.  My family and I ate there on a Thursday night.  We were the only table in the dining area, and when I took a peek in the bar, there may have been 2 or 3 tables, 1 of those being the owner.  Our server was distracted during our entire meal, and I felt all she wanted to do was get out of there.  Our drinks were served fairly quickly, but when we tasted them, there was a weirdness to them.  We complained to our server who informed us that they had recently replaced the soda lines and that it would be a week or two before the soda would be normal, and left it at that, not even offering to replace them with anything else.  We ordered the \"Loaded Potato Skins\" for an appetizer.  At the price of $9.99, we were sorely disappointed in what we got.  There was hardly any cheese or other toppings and we were given a scant amount of sour cream on the side.  My wife ordered the brisket with baked beans and corn, but had to get french fries as they were out of corn that evening.  Our daughter ordered the kids pulled pork with french fries, and I ordered the burger with onion rings, requesting the burger be cooked medium.  Our food was served fairly fast, but I could tell by just a glance, my wife was not going to be happy.  Her brisket was a fatty pile of slop.  Yes, brisket is a fatty cut of meat...but this was unreal.  The beans were luke warm and the fries were soggy from sitting in the run off from the brisket.  My burger looked fine, and our daughters pulled pork sandwiches looked like they were slapped together as an afterthought.  I asked for a side of mayo for my burger.....twice, as our server forgot about it the first time.  My wife ate a few of her fries and was ready to go.  I attempted to send back the brisket, but my wife said not to bother because she would not eat anything here after being served that.  Our daughters pulled pork was stringy and bland, and my burger was rare at best.  At this time, we gave up and asked for our bill.  Our server offered us boxes to take our food home with us.  I declined and explained that our food was disgusting and told her about each of our issues.  She walked away and returned shortly with our bill.  We were not given any sort of discount and nothing was anything taken off our bill.  No manager or owner came to talk to us about our experience.  Needless to say, we won't be back.  I don't know if this place will be around long, judging from our experience and that of other Yelpers."}
{"text":"We ate here this weekend. It's about as authentic as a $3 bill. I lived in Texas for many years, so I know good BBQ, and this was not it. The brisket and pork were very dry and tasteless. They had 3 bottles of red semi-liquids on the table, but that's as far as they went in terms of their resemblance to BBQ sauce. The service was also extermely slow. Eat here quick (or don't) because they won't be here long in this format. That ugly semi-wall will still be there though."}
{"text":"My wife, daughter and I stopped by this location this afternoon for a quick try at the new place.   The Host was rude and couldn't care less that we were there to spend money.  The bartender was very nice and could pour a pretty good beer.  The menu had nothing that would allow us to try the different types of BBQ they offered and when we requested a sampler we were told NO.  We ordered a couple of things off the limited menu to find a very bland, flavorless meat product and nothing very special in the meals.  

We will not be back for any meal at this location."}
{"text":"A decent place with a small menu.

Note:  this has taken the place of Liberty Station (and charges on your credit card state as much). The decor, although mostly western-themed, still has a Statue of Liberty - guess they couldn't find a can of paint!

My husband and I both ordered the beef brisket with fries and coleslaw. The slaw was good - it had flavor and the proper amount of bite. The fries were well done, although they appeared to be the exact ones I get at the grocery store. The brisket was well cooked, well seasoned, and moist. Unfortunately, it was also semi-shredded. Apparently no one has told the cook that brisket is supposed to be cut AGAINST the grain. As a result, it was tough and difficult to cut (which is what happens when you shred beef brisket). 

I had an iced tea (unsweetened - apparently they learned their lesson after an earlier comment), my husband had a beer. The iced tea was a little watery (flavorless), but the beer was served well chilled and was good (he never did find out which one he got - he left it to the waitress to choose a pale draft for him).

Prices weren't out of the ordinary, but based on the limited menu and the chef's needing to learn how to carve meet, we probably won't be back anytime soon, which is too bad. Surprise needs a great BBQ place."}
{"text":"Whiskey River BBQ  was Formally Liberty Station.  Some of the owners for Liberty bought out the other owners, and re-themed it as a BBQ joint.

Went there for a late lunch on the weekend.  Very small crowd.  Ordered the Pulled Pork Sandwich which was good.  Wife ordered the Brisket which was also good.  Portions were good sized and the sides were good too.  Everything was good, not great, nothing overly special

The theme was a bit confusing.  Definitely was patriotic Liberty Station decor with some cowboy items thrown in.  Bad country music as well.

Pros:
Food Tasty
Portion Sizes Good

Just OK:
Service
Overall Atmosphere

Cons:
Pricey for lunch, but could be decent for dinner"}
{"text":"My wife and i went for a sunday lunch. Once we got seated, got our drinks quick. We ordered burgers for lunch. Wife got fries and a salad with hers and i got onion rings. Both burgers came with bacon... Once the food arrived i tasted the bacon to see if i wanted it on my burger. For the first time in many years i actually had to spit out the most disgusting bacon i have ever tasted. When i questioned the waitress on the bacon, she said it may be the OLIVE OIL the use to cook it! Who cooks bacon with olive oil? Or rancid olive oil! We both ordered medium cooked burgers, both hockey puck patties came more than well done, very dry and flavorless. We could tell the fries and onion rings were frozen and not fresh. Having to pay extra for a side salad u would expect some substance, instead u get a pathetic helping of sliced iceberg with tomatoe and some mushroom slices. im a big guy and my wife is pregnant, so were usually ones to clean our plates, not today, we left with pleanty left over and didnt want any of it for later. My wife and i got home, and both of us within a few hours got diarhea!  Its a shame that such a new restaraunt has already chosen to skimp on quality and flavor in an economy where consumers are willing to pay more when they know something is worth it. 

The only reason i gave 2 stars is because they comp'd our appetizer and our waitress was nice. Im no expert, but this place doesnt stand a chance if they dont switch to fresh meat and products. I hope they do change their ways because this place has potential."}
{"text":"I noticed that the last review of this place was the 18th of this month.  Since then it appears that this place has now unexpectedly closed."}
{"text":"I took my family to this place recently and sadly was not impressed. I love BBQ and really want restaurants in Surprise to thrive. It was Liberty station and I was not impressed. We waited for a hostess for about 5 minutes before we were seated. The smell in the place was awesome, food wasn't so much. They do not have any coloring books an don't seem to cater at all to kids. Our waitress apparently went off shift. Nothing was said to us, just someone new took over in the middle of our meal. The brisket was dry, and they offer you 3 BBQ sauces that were not very good. If you have children there isn't a regular BBQ sauce for them, so don't order BBQ for them. Nothing is sauced which I always respect in a proper BBQ joint. They seem to be focused on their Bar area the most. So if your going for drinks, probably not a bad place. I hope this place comes around!"}
{"text":"Well you can add another closed business at this location!! Surprise is a very tough city to have a small business! You have to be great right at the start!!"}
{"text":"Our first visit and we enjoyed it. The pulled pork was a bit dry but still tasty. Ribs were very mosit and flavorful, corn was great. Teenage boys had burgers, cooked perfect with crispy bacon. Service from i believe laurie was awesome. Nice laid back atmosphere. We will be back"}
{"text":"Whiskey River BBQ and Brew may have a few kinks to unravel, but there are good things in the mix, too. We've dined there four times, and each time we've had delicious truly smoked BBQ.

Yes, they smoke their meat on site. The smoke ring is there. We have enjoyed their smoked half chicken with choice of sides, and last time, I asked about their smoked brisket. There is nothing worse than dry stringy brisket, and I like my smoked meat fatty, lush, and tender. Whiskey River managed to get all three right.

The menu is not too extensive, with just a few choices in each key BBQ area: beef brisket, pulled pork, the above-mentioned smoked half chicken, salads, and lots of fried sides. Appetizers are on the pricey side, with a small order of ordinary bacon and cheddar potato skins close to $10. Why bother. Just go for the meal. Fried fish is also available on Friday, and there are several off menu specials only available to whiskey River's Outlaw Club Members. 

You can become an Outlaw by signing up to receive text or email updates on the air website. This, unfortunately, is one of Whiskey River's flaws. In the first few weeks I was an outlaw, I received multiple daily texts and emails. After it hit the point of bothersome, I asked them to back off, and they did. 

Some of the specials for members include all you can eat BBQ beef ribs on Saturdays, or inexpensive brews during the week. 

Whiskey River has a large space, with both a dining room and plenty of seating space in the bar/lounge. We've seen live musicians in the dining room, even as early as 5 PM. That's nice for families with kids, and others who need to make it an early night. The entire space is casual, with denim slipcovers over the chairs and non-fancy wooden tables. Last time we were there, an artist was painting a mural behind the curved wall at the restaurant entrance. It's a bit of a western theme, and some of the other artwork is playful, cowboy fare. 

Service is casual, friendly, and yes, it can be a bit slow. I am a fanatic about my iced tea refills, and with good saucy Q, I don't want to wait.

Speaking of the sauce, there are three options at your table. A sweet apple BBQ sauce, the whiskey sauce, which is probably their house sauce, and something more Southwestern, that they say is more spicy. Not sure I agree with that, but it's all good.

According to their recent ads, Whiskey River now offers delivery. However, there's nothing like sitting in close quarters with a smoker...not the pack a day kind, but the kind that turns tough cuts into meaty goodness. 

We have dined at this location before its current cowboy makeover, and while we loved Eureka  Grill, this is more practical for Surprise. Family friendly, economical, and with live music several nights each week, it's a fun night out at one easy location."}
{"text":"So 3 of us went in today to check the place out.  It was decently busy for a Thursday night.  Straight-forward layout.  The first room you see is the \"family dining\" area I would say.  Well-lit, country music playing but not too loud.  To the right is the bar area, with a bar and with dining tables, also.  It's darker and a little louder in there, but by  no means a hopping, energetic place.  As soon as you come in the door, there is a giant barrel of peanuts that you help yourself to, which is nice to take to the table and munch on. 

We were sat after a few minutes of awkwardly standing in the entrance--way, wondering \"Do we seat ourselves?\"  \"Is anybody here?\"  \"Why did that lady walk by us?\"  Then it took a bit of time for our waitress to come and take our drink order.  I got unsweetened green tea, which the waitress said they had- but they only have sweetened.  She didn't realize that, so I got water- no problem there, she didn't put it on our tab or anything (just a novice mistake by people who don't quite know the menu yet).  The menu is fairly basic- a few salads, some fish choices and pasta choices, but then your bbq basics- beef brisket, pulled pork sandwich, ribs, traditional sides.  Sandwiches are all around $9 with one side, meals are around $13 with 2 sides.  

I got the pulled pork sandwich.  I wanted a side salad, but they only had a variety of creamy dressings and Italian and I prefer a viniagrette, so instead I went with the mashed potatoes.  They had too much gravy for my taste, but they were good- looked homemade.  The pulled pork sandwich wasn't really \"pulled\".  The chunks of pork were big- too hard to bite and eat in sandwich form.  I've been to a few different bbq places and they all do pulled pork differently- some really shred it and mix the sauce, some give you plain chunks of pork that you sauce.  This place is the latter.  I prefer the former (a la Dinosaur BBQ).  The seeded bun was toasted, though, and very fresh and tasty.  There was a good amount of pork on the sandwich, and it was also tasty.   There's 3 different types of bbq sauce on the table- an apple one (too sweet for me), the regular one (just right), and then a hot one (which I didn't try, but the waitress said had bite to it).  The sauce was good and pork was good, overall.  I was full after the sandwich, which is a good thing.

One of my dining mates also got the pulled pork sandwich, but with fries, which looked NOT homemade- frozen probably :(.  My husband got the half chicken dinner.  His chicken was juicy and had a really strong flavor without any bbq sauce added.  The breast was kind of on the small side, though.  He got green beans as a side, and they were pretty good- looked like they had been cooked on a skillet or something with garlic.

Overall, a decent experience.  But it's very clear they have some kinks to work out- at the tables around me, several mistakes were happening.  There was an old couple next to us that had many things go wrong, including the wife's meal brought out about 10 minutes before the husband's.  They were really patient about it, and the restaurant sent someone over to apologize and to offer them a free dessert.  It seems like they're trying, but I think I'd wait a few months until the kinks are worked out to go back."}
{"text":"We got take-out here the other day. I got the grilled chicken, and my wife got the ribs. We thought they were both excellent. Also, side items were very good. I got green beans and corn; my wife got beans and corn. All the items were fresh, and well-prepared. Finally, of utmost importance for any BBQ joint, the BBQ sauces were very good, with varying levels of spiciness and sweetness. All in all an excellent meal. I honestly don't understand the poor reviews for this place. I recommend you decide for yourself."}
