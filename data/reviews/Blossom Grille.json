{"text":"I went for the Kings of Leon Concert. I was pleasantly surprised! Everyone was very nice and service was quick. I had a burger and the pretzel bites, which were both very good! I would like to go back to an orchestra which I have been told is more of an upscale setting."}
{"text":"I was pretty disappointed here and would not recommend that you waste your time or money. It's a great idea and I was very excited to try it, but they have a lot of kinks that need worked out. 

My friends and I traveled from Pittsburgh to see Dave Matthews & Tim Reynolds. From the minute we sat down, we got a \"bad vibe.\" Our waitress (didn't catch her name) did not seem very knowledgeable. My friend, who follows a ketogenic diet, ordered a burger, without a bun and asked if she could have a small salad in place of the French fries. The waitress seemed very confused by this, but said she would ask. I, then, ordered a turkey burger and asked if I could have a small garden salad to start and I was promptly told \"we don't do that.\" I didn't make a fuss (even though they have other salads on the menu and I know they have the ingredients available).  My $18 turkey burger was a frozen turkey patty and my French fries were undercooked, which really bummed me out. My sister ordered the Cobb salad and we were impressed by how huge it was when it was served, but it turned out it was mostly lettuce with sparse toppings. Sadly, she was still hungry when we left. 

We travel to Cleveland a lot to see shows, but will be looking elsewhere for pre-concert grub. . ."}
{"text":"This restaurant and wine bar is right at the blossom grounds at the back behind most concession stands.

We had a great night of wine, sophisticated creative new-American-fusion cuisine. On the table: ancho-rubbed pork belly (tender, smoky and flavorful), duck confit fried wontons and scallop/prawn red curry (had the right amount of heat!). Food was served hot. Service was friendly and prompt. We got away with \"walking in\" but hostess says, most nights are crowded and would be helped by advanced reservations. Cost for a party of 3 with bottle of wine: $100.

I guess there are two ways to enjoy blossom: either this fine dining route + pavilion seating OR ignore the restaurants and watch the show picnic style. I've had equal fun both ways. This place is worth a shot if you don't fancy preparing for a picnic."}
