{"text":"This place is the best sushi in Toronto. So yummy and super friendly. Love this place"}
{"text":"As a sushi chef myself, I would definitely recommend this one out of all the sushi restaurants in the vicinity. I got the Daeco combo which includes 5 nigiris, 5 sashimi, and your choice of roll. I got spicy salmon. They also gave me some miso salad and miso soup and green tea.   The fish was VERY fresh and the salmon felt like it was melting in my mouth. Rice was almost the perfect consistency. I'm the spicy salmon, I couldn't taste anyvsriracha, which means that they make their own spicy mix. I also pay attention to little things like the quality of wasabi and soy sauce which was excellent. None of that kikoman soy sauce BS. None of that white washed non- spicy wasabi.  The service was good as well. Very respectful and reserved. The waitress was a cute korean lady, which was a plus.  I would definitely come here again the next time I visit toronto"}
{"text":"They've messed up my order a couple times, and food has been late, but it's a decent spot considering everything and the location.  Don't try to come here late at night though, they're closed and there's another sushi spot around the corner."}
{"text":"People who think this place is amazing don't know what they are missing or must be used to AYCE places only... I stopped here for lunch a month or so ago and was severely disappointed. The restaurant is quite small and cramped feeling (not a deal breaker). I found service to be attentive but everything was clearly super rushed, which showed in the quality (or lack thereof). Sashimi was thin and unevenly cut. The consistency of the rice on the rolls wasn't right and they were small and somewhat messily assembled. I found the prices high for such low quality.   In short: This place is about quantity over quality, but doesn't have the prices to match!"}
{"text":"I finally found a great sushi restaurant in my neighbourhood and for a very reasonable price. It's far better than any of the restaurants around (I've tried 3 at least) and it costs about the same.   The fish is fresh - this is my main criteria for sushi. I'm very picky with freshness as I'm from a family of fishermen on the East Coast.   My boyfriend and I always order the O-makase (chef's choice) - either 25.00 or 30.00. They truely outdo themselves. Everything the chefs send out is fresh, delicious, beautifully presented, and filling. By the end we are both stuffed. If you're not up for 'chef's choice', at least try the seared fish (all of them are delicious).   The service is immaculate - both servers we've had are very attentive and friendly. I put my scarf on last night and he said he turned the heat on because I was cold!   It's well worth a try and a return visit. It's only a few minutes from the subway stop by foot so don't let location deter you!  This place reminds us of Guu without the hours long wait and higher prices."}
{"text":"A downside to living by Yonge Street is that besides the ho-hum choices of chains, there is a lack of good restaurant choices that do not cost an arm and a leg. This humble sushi joint tucked inside an office building is somewhat of a gem.  The decor is rather simple, but gives off a comfortable cozy vibe with cheesy jazz music courtesy from the likes of Diana Krall, as well as cutesy authentic japanese-looking bamboo placemats.  The staff is friendly and attentive. They make sure that you have enough tea or soup at any given time. The miso soup is flavourful and comes with green onions and plenty of enoki mushrooms.  I would have to agree with another reviewer who mentioned that their knife skills are lacking causing uneven maki pieces. But fortunately, their great flavours and value more than make up for it.  As for their menu, their love of blowtorch-use makes their food just that much better. The bento box comes with blow-torched shrimp or scallop, and those are must-haves. They even like to use a bit of it on their unagi donburi (which by the way, they accidentally left off their new menu but you can still order it, oops!) to create a nice slightly burned crust. The triple tuna maki is amazing: seared albacore, butterfish and ahi tuna... flavour overload! Their spicy mayo has a nice hint of red pepper and tomato, which is refreshing from what some of the lower-end sushi places use.  Despite its typo-filled menu, lack of outstanding wall decorations, and hidden location, it is definitely worth visit and a refreshing new addition to the Yonge & St Clair area."}
{"text":"Although it's not the fastest place in the area, it's the best lunchtime sushi place I've found. Tried the blow-torch shrimp bento and everything was fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"Got lunch takeout, Maki A special (8 pcs each spicy tuna & salmon, with miso & salad) which came to around 13$. The sushi was good, the presentation was really cute (little parsley in between the rows of rolls) and the miso soup was great. The service in the restaurant was excellent. The waitress was super friendly, asked us to sit down and brought us water while we waited. Made me want to go back for a sit-down meal!"}
{"text":"I've taken out from Daeco three times, always ordering the Maki Deluxe combo. I find the sushi fresh, delicious and thorough: the end-of-roll pieces aren't lacking (like they sometimes are at other sushi places). I'd recommend trying this place; I think it's the best sushi option in the area by far."}
{"text":"Horrible lunch service. Came today for take out. Ordered a lunch special, was told it would take 30 mins. I came back in 30 mins only to find out they forgot my order and was asked to wait another 10 mins.  I then proceeded to see the owner stick a piece of chicken in the microwave and that was the \"spicy chicken teriyaki\" lunch special.   There are many other sushi restaurants in this neighborhood, no reason to eat here."}
{"text":"Daeco is a relatively unassuming little place a little west of St. Clair station. I'm pretty sure that it's the only good Japanese restaurant in the general area, and the best thing is that it's price point is also pretty much the same as the other Japanese places as well.   The maki set A was quite good, with spicy salmon and spicy tuna rolls. They were just the right amount of spice, the ideal amount of crunch, and rice that was packed well. Of course, the fish was fresh too.   The atmosphere is fairly relaxed and the prices are quite good. I've noticed a $30-$40 omakase option during dinner time and I might go back sometime to try it! For now, this place definitely deserves some attention for it's good quality, fairly priced food!   For more details and more pictures, feel free to visit my blog, which is conveniently located in my profile. :)"}
{"text":"Dropped by for lunch on a Wednesday with my coworkers and we were surprised to see it relatively packed.   We ordered the medium sushi boat recommended for three people and were absolutely stuffed.   We were able to substitute one of the chef choice rolls with the double red dragon roll.   Overall a decent lunch spot in the area but the wait was a little bit longer than expected due to high volume and only one girl serving during the rush."}
{"text":"Wish I could give less then one star for this review but it wont let me. I had received a gift certificate from a client for this establishment a little over a week ago called ahead a day before to place a large take out order with them. When I called and placed the order I informed them that I would be paying by gift card and gave them the card number. They said OK and told me the time it would be available for me to pick up the following day.   Today when I went to pick up my order and handed them the gift certificate they looked at me and said \" we don't take these gift cards\". I politely asked them why not and they replied with \" These are from the old owners we are new owners\" I don't know why this would be my problem I would think that regardless they would be honoring gift cards no matter what. A gentleman behind me also chimed in after noticing me arguing with these people for some time and agreed that they should be honoring the gift card for me.  The woman then spoke with a man standing beside her and again told me she would not take the gift card.   This was by far the worst customer service experience I have had in a VERY long time. I think the icing on the cake was when the woman at the counter asked me if I would like to talk to her lawyer?!?!?!?   I hated to be holding up the line but I was determined that this was unfair and knowing someone just recently purchased this gift card I was outraged. My client had paid $100.00 for this card and gave it to me as a Christmas gift , I'm sure if they would have known ownership would be changing and new owners would not be accepting their gift cards they would have kept their money and gone somewhere else . If you have a gift card for this place BEWARE it might be from the previous owners and will NOT be accepted!"}
{"text":"came here for an early dinner with a friend on a tuesday night.   the place looks practically deserted and not very visible from the sidewalk - it's just inside an office buiilding with an entrance on the side.  the staff is very friendly and I assume they're also the owners. they were very attentive and even though our waitress didn't speak very good english she did try her best to make sure we're happy =)  oh and the food! it was great! I mean how often do you get 24 rolls (3 different kinds) for just $15 (tax included)! I don't think that often. Oh and miso soup + salad were included too=) great deal! I had veg special - that was 24 rolls - avocado, cucumber, mushroom + 2 inari sushi + soup+salad! amazing deal!"}
{"text":"Daeco is located in the lobby of the 40 St Clair West office building.  You could probably walk by this a hundred times and barely notice that there's a restuarant here.  It's a small Japanese family run restaurant where the service is spectacular, to a point where you feel a bit smothered.  They're constantly over checking to make sure my tea pot is hot and like a hospital host in a Japanese home making sure I have everything I need.    The owner even saved a copy of a golf magazine for me knowing that I'm a bit of an addict.  She must have held on to it for weeks for me to arrive.  How many other places know your hobbies and brings you a magazine?!?!  I typically only order the spicy tuna/salmon maki, as that's a great lunch value menu item at $11.  You get 8 pieces of each and it comes with a really good miso soup and a typical japanese house salad.  The knife skills of the sushi master definitely needs some work.  I have yet to get 8 even pieces.  I'll get a giant chunk that I can barely fit into my large mouth, then a piece a quarter of that size.  Knife skill aside, the maki is quite yummy as they throw in tempura bits.  Not sure how long they'll survive here as it doesn't look too busy, but hopefully this'll help change it."}
{"text":"Daeco sushi has really good quality of fish and is reasonably priced. Not a place that I would personally sit and eat in because it is slightly cramped; I usually do takeouts. Although there's a language barrier at times, the staff is super friendly."}
{"text":"In terms of sushi the quality is okay.  Portion was a little small for its price. Staff was friendly and seated us right away and the food came in short time.  But one problem we had was a little surprise when we got the bill all the prices went up we were so confused so we asked our server why there was the discrepancy he grabbed a menu and said the price is correct and indeed the menu had new sticker prices so it turns out the 4 menus we got were not updated with the new pricing and he apologized for that  we didn't want to make a big deal but don't think that is good business practice at all."}
{"text":"The food was cheaper than other sushi restaurants in this area but quite delicious. I ordered Maki set A which had spicy salmon rolls and salmon rolls. It also came with Miso soup and salad. There was a bit too much tempura and bit too less salmon for a salmon fan like me. The Miso soup was tasty. It had enough mushrooms and green onions. Overall a pretty good experience."}
{"text":"I finally popped in here after walking by this place a dozen times on my way to Korean Consulate (and ironically, it turns out this place is run by Koreans).   I got the spicy lunch special which included 6 spicy salmon and 6 spicy tuna rolls, with the typical salad and soup appetizers. While most of the ingredients were fresh (minus the avocado), the spicy sauce was pretty bland. It was as if someone just threw together vinegar, soy sauce, wasabi, and a dash of red food coloring, and then patted themselves on the back for creating a 'secret' recipe (Cue management saying, \"How'd she know !??!\"). The sushi was just boring and a bit of a chore to eat (and this is coming from someone who just ate frozen sushi!).   And since there's another sushi place around the corner from this one, I genuinely don't know how long they'll last.   This place wasn't horrible, and I won't give it 2 stars because I haven't any other items on the menu and the service was good, but it certainly didn't wow me."}
{"text":"Can't really rate this place properly because we left without ordering...or seeing a menu... Or seeing a waiter. We were greeted and seated then...Cue the crickets... Nothing. No menu. No offer of drinks. No waiter to be seen. Some more waiting. So we left. Quizzical look from the chef as we exited but still no suggestion of menus food or drinks."}
{"text":"Great friendly staff. Small intimate place along st Clair. Had the gyoza soup. Great taste and not oily. Perfect for a cold winter day"}
{"text":"Cute and quiet place. The sushi is fresh and reasonably priced for its portion. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Came to Daeco on a Sunday afternoon and the place was empty.  We ordered one of the special platters (maybe called the Daeco?) and an order of Baked Shrimp Tempura.  The platter was tasty - the rolls were good, and the sashimi were large. The biggest issue was the shrimp. I should have noticed something was awry when I heard the microwave go off TWICE, but I didn't think anything of it until I tasted the shrimp, which had a limp batter and a distinctly once-frozen taste - blech.   I understand it said baked, so I was expecting something a little different than I'm used to, but this was simply not good.   The staff was friendly enough, and were accomodating when we asked if we could split our choice of rolls between two (half spicy salmon, half spicy tuna).  I also liked the decor, especially for how small the place is."}
