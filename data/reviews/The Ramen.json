{"text":"Great ramen noodles restaurant in downtown Calgary. Nice decor & atmosphere, good friendly service.  Never disappointed.  Been here 5/6 times & definitely will return & bring friends in."}
{"text":"Tasty and affordable! My favourite soup is the spicy ramen! The service is great and the location is ideal for those who live and/or work downtown. They do not take reservations for lunch so it is best if you get there before 12 pm specially on Fridays!"}
{"text":"Maybe I'm spoiled. I lived 5 years in Japan, and ate at every ramen and soba shop I ever saw. While The Ramen has very good, fresh noodles, their broth is neither tasty, nor satisfying.   But the true tragedy of this ramen is the pork. Two slices of tough, flavorless pork that looked grilled or pan fried. True pork in ramen should be falling apart, having been braised for a minimum of 24 hours. The cook should be ashamed.   On the plus side, the staff is friendly, smiling, happy to be there and just plain Ol' nice to be around. Fast service, too.   Don't know if I'll try again."}
{"text":"I feel very bad writing this review.  Positives: the staff, very friendly smiling and attentive - great job girls!  Negatives: the food! I had chilli ramen, bit spicy, portion was adequate for lunch, taste was just nothing special. Two paper thin slices of dry, actually disgusting tasting pork. My God, what was that all about?! A waitress recommended adding a pickled egg as it was meant to go great with the meal. Well it added no value or taste what's or ever and the egg, seriously one egg $2! The bill came down to nearly $14  just for a ramen with stupid boiled egg! Waste of money. I didn't enjoy it at all, ate a half just because I was hungry. The owner needs to get a grip.  Won't be back ever again"}
{"text":"Excellent!  The Ramen serves up arguably the best chicken-based broth ramen noodles in town!  Spicy Miso Ramen (with pork)...5 stars.  A VERY good dish!  It starts with the broth...simply perfect. The chicken broth is velvety; a very well balanced and perfectly seasoned soup. Definitely the best chicken-based ramen broth I've had in Calgary.  A broth this good will make everything else taste even better, especially the ubiquitous ramen noodles and vegetable dressings.  The slices of pork loin were nice and tender, though I would've preferred braised pork belly.  Nevertheless, most folks prefer leaner protein anyway (I think).  Globefish Bao...5 stars.  Another excellent dish!  A generous portion of braised pork belly and matchstick scallions folded inside an Asian rice-flour bun.  The pork belly is perfectly prepared and super tender.  The soy-mirin sauce that coats and infuses the pork belly is extremely flavorful with the right consistency.  It wasn't necessary, but they added a bit of Japanese mayo sauce to the \"Asian tacos\"."}
{"text":"Ramen? Downtown? Fresh and inexpensive? Sign me up.  The geniuses behind Globefish bring you their latest venture, \"The Ramen\". Their traditional and modern versions of the ever popular ramen soup are sure to please. I ordered the \"Samurai with extra pork\" which was a perfectly spicy noodle-soup for lunch. This location is made fresh everyday so they only remain open until they sell out of noodles. After only being open for a month, this location is becoming increasingly popular making it more and more difficult to get a seat at lunch. You should probably come early in order to get a seat and parking (there are very few stalls).  The Ramen is a great new restaurant that is rapidly gaining the popularity that it deserves."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh noodles for a great price. Warm and friendly service - server was fast to come and take our orders and the food came out in good time and piping hot. Don't be put off by the menu - vegetarians can adapt some of the dishes and I was able to adapt the meal for not eating chicken and pork. I'll definitely be back - a great downtown option."}
