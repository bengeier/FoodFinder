{"text":"I called and emailed a week before arriving for US college football games. They said that 90% they could stream our game. I also emailed them to make sure that they would remember us. We drove 30 minutes from downtown Toronto to watch a game, when they were only playing NFL games on multiple TVs. I guess we fell in the 90% streaming default. I would not suggest going here unless you are in the neighborhood and want to watch two NFL games on TV."}
{"text":"We went in to have their smoked wings which are the best wings in the city and found out they are participating in the Winterlicious.  We decided to try the Winterlicious dinner and we were extremely happy that we did.   It was difficult to make a choice from the menu but we chose the PEI muscles in smoked tomatoe sauce and piri piri Chicken.   The food was phenomenal!  The muscles were plump and juicy, the sauce they were in was delicious,  and the chicken was crispy on the outside tender and moist on the inside.   We highly recommend you try the winterlicious menu or anything else on their regular menu you will not be disappointed. i'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"I had the Rice Jambalya, it was pretty good. Nice open space, atmosphere was good. Took a little longer than I would of liked for my server to come around every now and then. I used the Yelp checkin and I definitely got my Pork slider. Could potentially come back here."}
{"text":"Good food, great service. Pulled pork poutine was excellent, good portion. Smoked wings were on point. Brisket is delicious. Lots of tv's. Huge booths."}
{"text":"I am writing this review after visiting a different bbq restaurant in town. This was one of the well-reviewed, hipster-loved, too-haughty-for-reservations places that had recently received \"best bqq wings in Toronto\" award from a Toronto magazine.  And their food didn't hold a candle to Rally's. Don't let the very sports-bar esque decor, outside appearance, and wall of tvs fool you, they clearly put A LOT of effort into producing good food. The wings are smoked then flash-fried: it gives them this great smokey, bbq taste and just a little crisp while not being too heavy. They are coated in the perfect amount of sauce. They are very well-executed and my favourite in the GTA. We've had good experiences with everything we've ordered. My wife is not big on wings/ribs/bbq but has found multiple things (including the tasty burger) on the menu that she enjoys. I have also tried the ribs (very good) and the sliders and enjoyed them both. We've also had brunch and had a good experience."}
{"text":"Quick spoiler: great food, modern atmosphere, but everyone was so thirsty after the meal it kind of ruined the experience.  Atmosphere/Service: very clean modern looking bar. Plenty of TVs all over if you wanted to catch a game here with friends. Server was friendly very friendly. Only odd thing was when I asked for recommendations, she literally ended up recommending everything on the menu item by item.  Order/Food: 1) Pulled pork sliders. Great smoke flavor with on a fresh bun. Delicious (all pork items were great). Winner all across our group. 2) pulled pork poutine. Again the pork was king and was full of smoke flavor. Portion was huge! But the price justified it. 3) beef brisket sandwich. Again big bold flavors. However my asian friend complained it was awkward for them as they were used to having it in soup and the BBQ smoke flavor just didn't sit right with them. 4) country fried chicken. Highly recommended by the waitress, completely bombed. Worst dish of the night and oddly the smallest portion. Wouldn't recommend this considering all the other tasty items.  Why is it 3 stars then? After the delicious meal my entire party became unbelievably thirsty. We drank litres of water and went to bed with dry throats! I'm not sure what they used or if it was just from the smoking technique, but i guess you pay for big flavor. So good yet i would never go back because of this."}
{"text":"great bbq, great view of screens from all over the restaurant. The sandwiches are amazing and the pulled pork poutine is killer.  I like the mac salad as well as a side.  I have had the sweet potato fries before, but those are nothing special.  come here for the bbq."}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal here. Been desperate to find a decent BBQ/smokehouse in the city for quite some time.  These guys will do until some ex Argo from the southern USA realizes his life back home is actually not worth returning to and decides to open a smokehouse in the city. Staff are always polite and courteous. Owner has introduced himself a few times now for an added personal touch. When I have visitors from out of town this is a place we always attend for both the bar and food."}
{"text":"I had the beef brisket and Mac n cheese oh my stars that Mac n cheese was heavenly. My partner had the shrimp po boy and sweet potato fries which he gobbled up in 10 mins let's just say he really liked it lol. The service was great as well. We will be back next weekend to try the fried chicken :)"}
{"text":"good food, spacious decor and decent pricing  Chicken wings are soooo good and big! The flavouring is a bit off, their medium is a mild at other places, and hot is medium.   Onion rings are one of the best i've ever had. Sandwiches are also very good!  If i lived in the neighbourhood I would definately make this a favourites"}
{"text":"Food poisoning! Ordered wings and poutine for take out tonight and was very disappointed!  The wings were terrible, and half way through the meal I became sick!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great food, great service. The brisket sandwich is a must try,  my husband thought he had died and gone to heaven!"}
{"text":"Food Quality & Price:  Great selection of reasonably priced foods. Everyone enjoyed their meal (not one complaint). I had the Fish Tacos (appetizer) and it was just the right amount of crunch and zest. The Jambalaya was also very popular. Can't go wrong with any of the wings or burgers either. Entrees range between $15 - $25. Apps are on the higher end (around $10 each). Sweet potato fries were great (you can add them as a side).  Facility: Lovely layout and floor plan for a sports bar. TVs everywhere (on all walls). Lighting is not too dim, you can definitely see the menu but has a nice relaxed feeling. Washrooms are clean and modern. The only bone I have to pick which lost Rally 0.5 stars is that the washroom water is ice cold. When eating any sort of bar food with hands (burgers, fries, wings etc), you need to be hygienic and have patrons with clean hands (or risk getting sick at your establishment).   Service: Janelle was our server and she was fantastic. Very attentive, knowledgeable and efficient. She asked for who was going to be billed together right toff the bat when we ordered and refilled our water even before it was empty! Granted, there wasn't many people there at 5pm, so I'm not sure how well the service works when the place is packed.  We have a lot of young adults in our group, and from experience groups like these usually get judged unfairly and received poor treatment. But, at Rally, we were treated very well. It was a birthday event and the birthday girl got a small cake with a candle.   Overall: A really great hang out place. If I lived closer, I wouldn't doubt that it would become a regular hang out for me. I really enjoyed my experience and will return to Rally if I get the chance!!  4.5/5"}
{"text":"Went here on a whim today when Jawny Bakers patio was all full. Set out for the afternoon to have a few apps and drinks with my mom for Mother's Day. The place was dead but all the better for us, we ordered some drinks, the crab cakes, quesadillas, and nachos. Food and drinks came out super quick, even hand delivered by the manager which was nice. The crab cakes were a bit small but that is to be expected from crab cakes these days, I find you can't quite get good value when it comes to ordering them. However, they were delicious, crunchy, and had a fantastic lemon dill aioli with them. The nachos were some of the best I've ever had, the chips were light, the chili was spicy and delicious, it also came with olives, gooey cheese and pickled jalapeños. I appreciate there was no filter shredded lettuce and tomatoes on there. The quesadillas were yummy but didn't exactly match what was advertised on the menu, I didn't see any pulled chicken but the peppers and onions tasted good. But, for a $12 I should be able to find the chicken! Overall this place proved to be great, they have a nice patio, quick service and delicious food, I will definitely recommend to friends."}
{"text":"I was there on a wends and they had half price tacos, all I can say is yum!  You have to try their tuna tacos, they are awesome."}
{"text":"Great place  Love the atmosphere  Love the tv Great beer choices  Nice brisket nice wings"}
{"text":"Used to be a regular at Rally's, meaning twice a month. Had a bad experience so hadn't been back for a few years. Was in the neighborhood and thought I would give it a try again. Well I remember why I stopped going. The service and food has definitely gone down hill. The nacho's were barely cooked, the cheese wasn't even melted. Asked for no olives and beef on the side. Well we got jalapeno's on the side, olives on the side, meat on the side. So basically it was nacho's and cheese plus gauc and that was just over $20. The roof was leaking and dripping into my purse, mentioned to the manager and was advised it is condensation and basically too bad. So if you know this.....then maybe you may want to look into it. Wasn't fun sitting there with water dripping on the bench beside me or at the end of or table. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Delicious wings! They have such a great  smoke and unlike other places their suicide is not too vinegary (they could be spicier though). The other stuff on the menu is pretty good but the service is not very good at all, especially on busy days. Other than that I am fan!"}
{"text":"Amazing service and experience! The place has multiple TVs that the only problem was which tv you'd choose to look at. I came here on Valentine's Day for all-star weekend and it was great.   I made reservations for my bf and I and we were seated right away when we got there. The waitress was awesome, never had to wait or call her down because she kept coming to check up on us and refill our waters without asking.   The food was nicely portioned, drinks were good except the sangria had only apples in it and the apples weren't fresh but the drink by itself was nice and sweet, not a lot of vegetarian options but still enough to snack on or fill you up!  All in all its great for sports night because of how open the space is and the amount of tv placed everywhere to make sure no one misses the game!"}
{"text":"Staff were friendly and the place is priced reasonably. I'm not a big sports fan so the game wasn't too interesting to me, but the atmosphere was good. The food was excellent! Surprisingly good actually."}
{"text":"Here's an old school sports bar and ribs joint that manages to get its food right.  I popped by for some takeout, and as usual there were the usual bar regulars keeping everyone entertained while I waited for my order.  The ribs are rich, flavourful and at the same level as what you would expect at a ribfest, only there's no lining up here.  The macaroni salad and coleslaw is quite tasty and you can tell they put a lot more effort into the sides than other places.  Pulled pork sandwich and fish taco were on point as well.  I would definitely drop by for the Monday $24 all you can eat rib special."}
{"text":"My first impression was that it was out of the way and that it could not possibly be a hit but the reviews swayed me. I came here to watch the champions league semifinal between Barcelona and Bayern Múnich and was treated to a very impressive locale that is dedicated to sports fans. The food is exceptional. I had the southern fried chicken sandwich and the sweet potato fries and my girlfriend had the chicken wrap with coleslaw. Both dishes came promptly and were delicious! They have a great selection of beers, including Ontario craft brews and also a few German and Belgian selections. The location itself is clean and newly renovated and I would highly recommend any sports fan visit to watch any game on multiple HD screens."}
{"text":"The monster burger was really good. Really good flavour, crispy crunchy chewy. If you're looking to share platters they do not have a selection platter the BBQ selection is limited.  Beside the ribs and brisket sandwich there is a limited selection.  The chicken quesadillas were delicious!  The Jambalaya was also really good, spicy but good.  The Frenchie burger was good but it seemed like it lacked the zing.  Finally, the pulled pork was salty though it did seem quite good. Maybe it was just mine. And I got a free slider!  The atmosphere is excellent with TVs everywhere. It seems they have a band every Friday so we'll be back on a Friday in the near future.   This truly is a hidden gem and I'll definitely be back with the gang."}
{"text":"The 2 stars are for the excellent service, the rest was has made us reconsider every coming again.  We used to eat here every month or so and it amazing. But haven't been in about a year.  We had a Groupon.  With the 40% off appetizers, the price was the same as a groupon, and the 2 cannot be combined.  The add to the happy hour appetizers had no exclusions but when we ordered the 2 apps we wanted, they were not included, I felt the promotion was misleading and should have stated the exclusions.  Starter salads were not included either.   The wife used to like this place because she has a weight problem and could always get the menu items grilled or customized for her diet.  -- and I could order the all you can eat ribs etc.  A good place for the both of us.  She was very disappointed, the roasted potatoes were deep fried, the veggies were boiled and watery instead of roasted, the flat bread was pre made and was unable to get 1/2 cheese or cheese other other than goat, the calamari couldn't be broiled or grilled.  I don't think she will ever suggest we go back.  It's too bad because it used to be really good food, maybe we just hit a bad night, but seems it's still a really nice bar to drop by and have a couple drinks. But for a nice meal my first choice would be somewhere else"}
{"text":"Great food, service, and environment. Management even came out to meet us in person. We had a party of 5 and everybody was stuffed from their meal. I would go back anytime!"}
{"text":"When there for lunch with my daughter. The place was very empty but it was during the christmas break.  I had the brisket sandwich and daughter had the pulled pork. Both were good, a bit too much sauce on the brisket for my tastes. I tried her pulled pork and thought it was better.  I will have to go back one evening to try the ribs. So I am was pleased with the experience and would be willing to go again. Just did not \"amaze\" me in one sitting."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. The servers are friendly,  the food is amazing. I had the wings and burger. The wings are slow cooked. They are honestly probably the best ive ever Eaten. I've been to many wing places for wings. They know how to cook wings here. The prices are decent. Could be lower, but the food here is worth. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Not a lot of parking, but once inside the place is a great spot to watch the game. Had the southern fried chicken which tasted good, however the portion sizes varied as my friend sitting next to me got a piece of chicken double the size of what I was served."}
{"text":"I am craving smoky comfort food. Southern cooking and backyard barbeque seems to be all the rage these days, and when it's good, there is nothing better. I would drive just about anywhere for it. Just like down south, where the most incredible bbq joints are tucked away from the main streets, we need to go off the beaten path for that lip-smacking good stuff.  Introduced to Toronto restaurant, Rally Sports Bar + Smokehouse, at the Toronto Delicious Show, I was seduced by a jambalaya. Chock full of chicken, shrimp and chorizo, the jambalaya is Louisiana's answer to paella, and Rally's answer to, \"what can I eat tonight that is hearty and flavourful?\" Oh, it's got a kick--but the spice is not overpowering, and a fresh confluence of flavours is picked up in each spoonful of rice.  The slow cooker is the star here, and the wood burning bbq punctuates the menu. Poutine of thick cut fries is enlivened with smoked cheddar curds and peppercorn brisket. \"You can turn the heat up, but you can't turn it off,\" co-owner, Chris Papadimitriou tells me. In-house made bbq sauce is so tangy, and the vinegar in the sauce really cuts the sweetness perfectly. As the pulled pork sandwich arrives, my Pavlovian response ignites, and with each mouthwatering bite I sink into bliss. Back ribs are cut with some of the loin attached so they have a lot more meat on them. They are indeed very lean and meaty; and slow cooked and smoked to that tender charcoal essence that we love.   Another southern staple is the \"po-boy\". I can honestly say that in all my travels down south, I never had it so good. Rally's shrimp Po boy sandwich is light and crunchy, and loaded with plump shrimp. There is not one miss on this menu, and the Po-boy is the quiet over-achiever.  My focus does not leave my plate, but just in case I didn't come here for the food, I am reminded that there are over 40 big-screen HD TV's that display every major sporting event every day of the year. On Friday nights, martinis are $5. Snacking on my shrimp Po boy, sipping a martini and watching boxing, UFC, NHL, MLB, NBA, NFL, or UEFA would be A.OK with me!  My sweet ending is a luscious southern peach cobbler served in a mason jar and, for good measure, one warm velvety chocolate torte. Even the espresso is rich and bold. This is not your average sports bar. Rally Sports Bar + Smokehouse is a food-centric destination run by people who are serious about food...and happen to love sports."}
{"text":"Took the family out for victoria day dinner. This place is a gem. Unique well made food at reasonable prices. We came at a slower time, but had great service. I'm worried the world will find out about this place and there will be waits to get in. It is worthy of that. Now to go on a game night! Don't hesitate go this place if you are debating."}
{"text":"Oh my! It was the best ribs I ever had here in Canada. No need to ever go to a Rib fest. The meat was falling of the bone and my partner got Southern Style Chicken - which was deep fried Mennonite chicken from St Jacobs with a creamy cheese sauce over it. The chicken was juicy and the sauce had pieces of sausage. I would have never guest that combo and it was to die for. Can't wait to go back. Thank God there is a good Rib place in Toronto."}
{"text":"Awesome venue to watch a game. Decent bar grub. Well priced drinks. Friendly service."}
{"text":"Found on yelp. With the family, there was something for everybody! Clean, happy efficient staff and fresh tasty food. From the nachos which we found out the tortillas were made from scratch, to ribs and chicken tenders, all was great. We'll be back, thanks."}
{"text":"Totally lucked into this place after spending the afternoon with the wife and kids at the Science Center. Looking for a family friendly spot, Of course, the wife wanted Jack Astor's but I can't stand the place so I called ahead to make sure these guys had a kid's menu (they do - 4 good options) and seating for 4 was available (it was - this place is huge).    We were greeted by a smiling host, seated in front of many TVs, and the host immediately hooked the kids up with crayons and paper for coloring.  I asked that the TV closest to us get tuned into the football playoff game and that was taken care of quickly.     The food was delicious!  I got the brisket sandwich and Pulled Pork Poutined the fries for an extra $5, which was the best decision I made all day. The pork poutine is likely the best I've ever had!  I closed my eyes and made the Homer Simpson \"arggghhhhhh\" sound after a few bites. Simply amazing! A must try.    The brisket sandwich was good, too, but couldn't compete with the flavors in the poutine. But still a solid sandwich, no doubt.  My wife got hot wings and they were hot and sticky and plenty meaty. She was a happy lady!    The kids even ate most of their grilled cheeses and French fries. The other kid menu options were chicken fingers, which I was told were made in house and the best thing on the kid's menu, beef sliders, and mac n'cheese.  The kid's meals were $7 which is lower than expected, although drinks and a dessert were not included, so after all that we probably spent about $12/kid on their meals.  Rally's is huge, has a ton of TVs, smiley happy waitresses, great BBQ, parking, and an owner who was seen mingling amongst his guests to make sure everyone is having a good time.  He hooked up my little ones with fairy stickers and chalk.  I mean come on - this place is perfect for kids.    I'm hoping my family trips take us to this area of the city again soon because there's lots more I want to try at Rally's...as long as it includes the Pulled Pork Poutine.   Oh, and my wife agreed that we made a good call not going to Jack Astor's!"}
{"text":"Great sports bar and great BBQ: it's a dream come true.  Sure I was sad when Rock 'n Roll Heaven closed it's doors. It forced me to drive all the way back to Niagara Falls to get my fill of mullets, acid wash and people stuck in the 80s and that's just inconvenient.  So, my recent and first visit to Rally already had some obstacles to overcome, but I'm happy to report that even without the mullets, it's a winner.  Though I stopped in for a lazy Sunday lunch (read: not specifically for sports- viewing), the viewing setup in the bar as a whole and especially in the main viewing pit was really impressive. Finally, someone understands that you're supposed to have a good view of multiple games/TVs at any time.   Additionally, my server was incredibly friendly, efficient and willing to accommodate an unusual request which brings me to my next point: The food.  Do yourself a favour: if you're going to order a BBQ mainstay - brisket or pulled pork - either order the sauce on the side or without the sauce because these guys actually know how to BBQ meat. The sauce, while good, is overpowering and hides a great product.   The brisket had a nice amount of fat, it was incredibly moist, the onions were a cool touch and most importantly, I could taste the smoke. Same goes for the pulled pork.  Another nice surprise: the burger (from the slider platter) was far better than I was expecting as well - it was really flavourful and was likely hand-ground as they claim. It's not Burger's Priest, but nothing else is."}
{"text":"Here is a super under rated spot and a hidden gem in the East end. Rally's has a great space with tons of flat screens so you never have to miss a sport.  This place is roomy and has a great clean feel.  Staff are super friendly and I'll get to the food in a second... The first time I went to Rally's my wife and I did what we always do when we can't decide.  We ordered most of the menu. I'm a huge fan of crab cakes so I couldn't pass those up.  A bit too much filler for my liking but non the less it had good flavor. My favourite to go item is their brisket sandwich, delicious! I love the balance of lean and fatty cuts you get on their fresh bun.  Smoke flavor is there and not too over barring.  If you're a seafood fan try their Po'Boy Shrimp sandwich filled with nice big shrimps. Of course their ribs...You can't have a successful smoke house without putting out some damn good ribs and Rally's smokes the competition.  Their fried chicken was a bit disappointing and I am a huge fan of fried chicken.  I found the skin/batter was a bit light and didn't crisp as much I usually like.  Instead, I would recommend the friend chicken sandwich.  I didn't notice the lack of thick crispy chicken skin in the sandwich since the melody of it all was awesome.  If you live near Victoria Park and Eglinton, do yourself the favour and hit this place up.  If you're a sports fan and looking for a new go to spot to watch your games you've got it all right here."}
{"text":"This place gets four stars on their burger alone, one of the best anywhere.  It's like a bigger version of the burgers priest.  High quality tasty beef with simple seasoning, its all about the BEEF!  We've also tried the po boy sandwich, not impressed, ribs were decent but their pulled pork sandwich is also really good.  The place itself is massive and is great to watch football at or other sporting events.  The servers we encountered  were all super nice and attentive.  If they can manage to bring all their food up to the level of that burger I'd sleep on the floor."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Rallys! My girlfriend and I live in the neighbourhood, and it is perfect walking distance for a night out to have a drink or two. This fact aside, the staff is great! They are so friendly, and even remember us when we show up. I always feel like I am welcome and that my business is appreciated. The food is always good, and they offer themed nights. Currently we are enjoying half priced tacos.... yum! I never saw myself as a \"local watering hole\" kinda person, but this place makes it hard not to be. The venue offers a lot of TVs and it's always easy to catch whatever sports game you're out to catch. Overall, great place. Happy to have it near my home. Come check it out!"}
{"text":"Nice sports bar with all the regular amenities - TVs, loud music, good selection of beers on tap, friendly staff, comfortable seating, and an outdoor patio. I had the jambalaya (what are you thinking, ordering creole in a sports bar?) and it was okay.  The balance of heat was very nice, the chicken was still tender and not dry, which was a big plus, but the shrimp should have been cooked first before being added to get rid of that fishy taste you get with frozen seafood, and the sausage was not Andouille but a chorizo with fennel in it. Not very authentic, but tasty nonetheless. If I go back I will have to try something else."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner as we wanted to try something new. The restaurant was clean and staff seemed very friendly. Melissa our waitress made sure we were ok the entry time, refilling our drinks and checking in on the food. We ordered the following: Appetizer - Crab cakes - Very good  Entries - I ordered the Fried Chicken with Mac & Cheese - amazing!!! Portions were good for the price.  I couldn't eat it all and brought it home for lunch the next day, made an outstanding lunch. Boyfriend ordered the steak and veggies- he said the steak was cooked to how he liked it and it was very good. All in all we will be returning and trying other items on the menu as they have a few dishes we would like to try."}
{"text":"Great place to go!  Good beers on tap, good food, and lots of screens.   We counted this place out when we lived in the neighbourhood; nice looking place with an often empty parking lot could suggest a not so great place.  Boy were we wrong.  We just moved out of the neighbourhood, but thankfully are still close enough to come back regularly, which we will.  If you want some good pub food and a beer, go in!!"}
{"text":"Wings are amazing.  Anything ordered that is smoked must be tried.  I also love that they have a parking lot.  In east york...a parking lot is a treat!!! A main floor washroom?  Yes they have that too!! I must add that the owner of this fine establishment, is really committed to great service and guest experience.  Must go and try on a weekend evening!!"}
{"text":"I'm glad Jen K mentioned it.. This is my local gem hidden away in the east end of town and it must have the hottest staff in the city and is one of the better sports bars to boot.  Wall to wall TVs, but more importantly the food is pretty dang good.  It's home to two of my favourite bartenders Court-nay and T, who may be some of the friendliest keeps in town.  This place is everything I look for in a sports bar.. especially after my bad experiences at WEGZ, this place kicks it's ass Monday, Tuesdays, to everything come Sunday.  I so wanted to keep this place a hidden gem, but at the last UFC there may have been only a handful of folks, I had no choice but to give it a plug."}
{"text":"Really good find in this neighbourhood, prefect for casual food and drinks! Our server was super friendly and the food was solid. My boyfriend ordered the ribs, which I wish I had also ordered! The fried chicken sandwich I got was good but not as succulent as those ribs.   This place satisfied our two requirements,TVs for boyfriend's sport watching and good food for my eating."}
{"text":"The house smoked wings were finished in a smoked Korean BBQ sauce and finished with sesame seeds -- perhaps this was why these were called Smoked \"Gangnam\" Style Wings.  That is definitely a head-turner and makes you want to order it to try.  I really liked these wings!  The smoked Korean BBQ sauce was tangy, a little bit sour, with a tiny bit of smoked flavour and spice."}
{"text":"I had no idea this place existed until a friend brought me here. Located in East York, it's an area I don't frequent often.   Sports Bar + Smokehouse... They've definitely got the sports bar part right...I am not decided on the smokehouse part. Lots of TVs around the bar, it's very spacious. I think it would be a great spot for big game days. I assume it won't be as busy as the bars in downtown, given it's location.  Although... Sunday afternoon, there were a couple of events going on. So it's definitely not dead!  The $4 small pint beer special was good. And the $5 Caesars were just fine - nothing fancy, but very satisfying for $5. I got the brisket sandwich... and it was a wee bit smaller than I expected. It's not small by any means...but typically at \"smokehouses\" they tend to be generous. The brisket itself was good... but i was highly disappointed by all the fatty bits in the sandwich. The meat was not trimmed well at all. It's just not pleasant.   Now the question is... would I go out of my way to visit again? I think I would... especially for game days. It seems they have enough TVs and space to handle a crowd. The jury's still out on the smokehouse."}
{"text":"My 2 friends and I went here yesterday, Tuesday and have tried the Winterlicious menu and since there were 3 of us, we ended up trying the whole menu:  1st of appetizers: Soup of the day- some leek +cream soup i think...My friend was not a fan of it. Mexico Street corn-seasoned barbecued corn on the cob with manchengo cheese...super delicious needs extra cheese. Smoked tomato mussels- fresh nova scotia mussels, shallots, white wine, house smoked tomato sauce- for me this is the best the mussels are big and the flavour is good.  Mains: Rib Trio-back ribs slow smoked for 5hrs served with cajun slaw and french fries with 3 dipping sauces(bbq peach, regular bbq and korean bbq sauce)...meet is very tender and not dry...we are not a fan of the coleslaw though much more of a sour taste. Smoked piri piri chocken-housed smoked chicken with traditional portugess dipping sauce served with cajun rice and slaw. For us We think this is the best...Although chicken looks dry in the outside, it is very tender in the inside and the cajun rice have dry texture but super tasty!  Blackened Catfish-farmed fresh catfish served with gumbo,hominy and okra...This dish have a southern taste but it also have some pickled vegetable which I'm not a fan of but the fish was cook right.  And of course the desserts: all of them are great depending on your preference:  Beignets-a new orleans classic fried doughnut covered jn powdered sugar and strawberry coulis dip...this is the very lighter dessert out of the three it is basically taste like the strawberry filled donuts thats just got out of the oven...yum! Apple Crumble-housemade warm apple crumble with bourbon Vanilla Cream...the apple is too sour for me..i think it wouldbe better with vanilla ice cream. Chocolate Pot-Rich chocolate hazelnuts pudding with toffee sugar and hazelnuts....this is the winner for me since it's dark and rich very yummy!  Surprisingly this bar gets busy with a mix crowd....Definitely will comd back and very recommendable as the waitress and the manager is very attentive."}
{"text":"Really great hidden gem in Scarborough:   Menu items I've tried:   -Wings: 3 different flavours: honey garlic, chili lime, and barbecue  -Classic Poutine: generous with cheese and gravy -Fried chicken with a side of macaroni salad  and mashed potato   -Their flavours are delicious; very generous with seasoning and sauces  -Staff are very friendly and always come around to check on you -It's a bit more quiet for a sports bar, compared to other sports bars. However on game days, much more busy -Overall a casual, clean and friendly atmosphere that's good for any number of people -Plenty of tvs to watch your sports and positioned so you don't have to turn while eating -Pricing is reasonable for the quality and quantity   I definitely recommend this place and will definitely be returning to try more menu items."}
{"text":"Wow. This place blew me away. Awesome food. In fact, best spots bar food I've ever had. Had fish taco, pulled pork nachos and smokehouse Cesar salad split between my wife. All were top shelf, prepared from scratch, even the nacho chips were made in the kitchen.   Great service, the owner even came over to make sure everything was ok.   Clean, new seating and more high def televisions than  you could shake a stick at.  I'm not even a sports fan but will come back regularly for the food.   Update. Brought whole family this time. My daughter loved the apple pie pancakes for brunch. Pulled pork poutine was decadent.   I had the smoked wings. I've never had wings that \" fell off the bone\" but these did. Very good, nice smoky flavour combined with wings that didn't have any sub skin fat."}
{"text":"Came here on a pretty slow Friday night. Service was decent, but without a bug crowd there to watch a big local game or UFC fight, you can see that this sports bar is average at best.  Choice of draft beers was okay, I think 10-12. I had the smoked brisket sandwich, which was $15 and average. Best part of the sandwich was the bread. Lol. It's missing coldslaw on it something. And the fries were meh. Aside from this sandwich and the ribs, I didn't see anything else smoked as the bar name implies.  Next time if I ever go back to watch something I'll be eating before hand."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch got the brisket lunch special and it was pretty darn good! The fries are just ok, nothing to brag about.   The service was good and friendly. They seem to have a decent selection on draft.   My friend ordered the club sandwich and thoroughly enjoyed it.  There are a few more items that I would like to try on the menu and will go back soon."}
{"text":"A nice, clean sports bar with lots of TV's, a decent beer selection and a menu that promises smoked BBQ. Am I really in Scarborough?   I came to Rally late on a Saturday night with a few Yelpers. From the parking lot we could smell the delicious scent of smoking meat which is always a plus. The restaurant is quite large, full of the TV's, and the décor is quite modern (I absolutely love the big booth seating).   We decided to share a beef brisket sandwich with a side of onion rings and a poutine. We also got a free pulled pork slider with our yelp check in offer. My favourite was probably the brisket, it was served on a nice French style baguette and the meat was pretty generously piled on. The meat was not melt in your mouth tender but was still pretty good. The brisket was doused in a BBQ sauce that was slightly too sweet for my liking, I would have preferred they serve the sauce on the side so that I could taste the meat and decide at my own discretion if it required sauce, all in all though this was a decent sandwich. The pulled pork slider was pretty good as well, generally I am not a big fan of pulled pork (not because I hate the idea but because most places don't make it well) however this was one of the better pulled pork sandwiches I have had. The sauce was not too sweet (My biggest complaint about most pulled pork is that the sauce is always too sweet) and the meat was quite moist, like the brisket this was pretty good but not mind-blowing.  The onion rings were pretty standard, nothing to write home about. The poutine was the most disappointing dish. It came to our table cold and IMO did not have enough gravy as there were many fries that were gravy-less. The gravy was nothing special; I would recommend you skip on the poutine. For dessert we ordered beignets (French donuts), these were hollow pockets of dough that were doused high with powdered sugar. These were ok, not too greasy but they did not blow me away. The end result of dessert was that the table looked like the end scene of Scarface thanks to the powdered sugar.   My favourite part of this place is the beer menu. For some reason Scarborough establishments like to boycott craft beer but lucky for me this place had a few local craft beers as well as some good imports, definitely a huge plus! The service was pretty good; our waitress was friendly and checked up on us often. Overall this would be a great place to grab some pub food, a drink and watch the game. Places like this are a rare find in Scarborough."}
{"text":"Perhaps there's a new chef?  Chilli lime is gone and there are other noticeable changes."}
{"text":"Went back here and used the fish taco deal.  The fish taco was a delight to my taste buds!  The service from the manager or owner was great this time because the owner or manager came by and made sure we were taken are of, maybe because I showed my yelp app to get the fish taco deal. In any case, got a free sample sip of the 100th meridian beer, which I highly recommend.  Had the pulled pork, which was saucy and not dry.  Also tried the burger which was pretty good as well.  If service was consistently friendly, then I'd give this a higher rating. For this visit, service was good as the owner or manager paid us attention, but the waitress said to me, so you just want the pulled pork on the side? With no smiles and at least twice, she definitely had an attitude."}
{"text":"I've been here more times than I can count on two hands. My brother's been here even more times than that. We come to eat. We bring friends to eat.  Wings night: Thursday night is half price wings--$6/lb. In house smoked wings with their amazing sauces. You haven't had wings this good before.  The baked beans are absolutely perfect. Definitely try the sandwiches and burgers. You can even order the salad and feel good about it. Great pulled pork poutine.  The place is always evolving. They change the menu based on input from the customers. Over the last year, they permanently added two or three wings flavours that they tested out on a weekly basis. They also added and tweaked other meals that people gave feedback on.  There's a certain waitress working there who just has the best attitude and makes dining there a treat--it'll be a shame if she moves on to another job. She provides that friendly mom&pop restaurant type of bond with the customer that you wouldn't expect from a big place like Rally's, and especially from a sports bar. In general, though, the waitresses are good, even if some seem unapproachable. If you think service is lacking, just speak up, they're good people."}
{"text":"A former co-worker, now friend, would talk about this place all the time; I finally met up with him and his girlfriend last Saturday to try their brunch.  All the talk was justified.  Basically it is a sports bar that does a really great breakfast in suburban East York.  I can only assume that dinner here would be amazing.  I had the eggs benny with pulled pork.  Delicious!  The usual fried potatoes accompanied the meal along with some fresh fruit.    The beer selection was great--I had a Beau's.    Service was top notch.  Prices are fair.  There wasn't much of a crowd but I'm told that the place gets packed on big game nights.  If you have a car, and live near or in East York, I highly recommend this place, even if you are not a sports person.  If you are sans auto but are anywhere near the 70A, then I also recommend this place."}
{"text":"This review is based upon our Winterlicious 2016 Dinner experience.  Came here at 5:30PM on a Wednesday and the place was almost empty. I believe they got busier around 7PM.  Appetizers: My BF and I both got the Mexican Street Corn (seasoned barbecued corn on the cob finished with manchego cheese). Which is absolutely delicious!! I could not stop eating! I think I finished it in 30 seconds and was craving for more! I recommend getting this appetizer. For me, it is the obvious choice looking at their appetizers selection for Winterlicious.  Main Course: Back Ribs Trio (back ribs slow smoked for five hours served with 3 signature sauces. served with cajun slaw and french fries) - tastes good. Would rate 9/10. Good serving size.  Piri-Piri Chicken (house smoked chicken with traditional portuguese dipping sauce served cajun rice and slaw) - I believe this is the best choice for main course, the chicken is spiced right, and the rice is tasty as well. Good serving size.  Desserts: Apple crumble - was pretty good, but it wasn't as sweet as I expected.  Double fudge (almost like a chocolate pudding) - I was wow-ed by how SWEET this is!! And with such a small serving, I felt that that serving size would have to be the most a person should get and nothing more, as it is extremely sweet, filling, and sooo good! Best dessert choice in my opinion.  Service was great as always, our server was always there and really attentive to our needs.  Good job, Rally's! You never fail to impress me!    Review 15 of 100"}
{"text":"After a bunch of us went knife throwing nearby, we wanted to grab a quick bite as many did not eat dinner. We used Yelp to call a few places but one of us who was familiar to the area recommended Rally's.  I quickly called to book a table for 10 - 15 and was delighted that they setup us up at the back so we can chat about our experience.  When we arrived, the dining area was cleared while the bar area was filled with sports fans. I was not too hungry and opted for a drink instead. Everyone order food as they were hungry after a night of knife throwing and they all seemed to enjoy the food. As an added bonus, Yelpers can check-in and get a free taco (of your choice) with an order of an entree.  Service was very attentive and they also gave us separate bills which some restaurants will tend to avoid due to the amount of work and the chance that the tip may not be as rewarding. Overall, a great experience and parking is plentiful although I did turn too early and parked next door."}
{"text":"Rare food for this area. It's hard to find BBQ that's isn't smothered in sauce. Meaty flavours and great Mac n cheese. Want to sample more. Prices are good."}
{"text":"An awesome place to go. Staff is friendly and go outbid their way to make you feel welcomed! Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Friends and I made our way here to catch the Raptors East finals game against the Cavs. While entering the building with excitement for the game, our enthusiasm was immediately deflated by the server who ignored us and rudely asked that I wait in line to be seated. Seeing how there was no one behind us and no hostess to be found, we should've known this place wasn't for us. Instead we gave it a shot and found there was very little to like about this place.   The food was forgettable but the service from our waitress was what really left a bitter taste in my mouth. I am sure not all your employees serve your customers this way, but we felt ignored the entire time we were here."}
{"text":"Made reservations for a party of ten, was running late so I called to let them know. The girl put me on hold and I was still on hold by the time I walked through the doors. There was nobody there to greet us (took a few seconds). I told the girl I was still on hold showing her my phone of over 8 minutes.  She looked blank and then mumbled spmething, didn't apologize then told us to follow her. A couple of our friends were already seated but I could only see the back of their heads so I wasn't sure if it was them or not when she asked me if I knew them. I started to say something and by the time I turned around the hostess was gone. All she seemed to be there for was to show off her half naked cleavage and hiked up mini skirt.   Large sports bar in the middle of nowhere with plenty of tv's. The HD projection needs to be upgraded as well as the audio system.  Food was hit and miss depending on what you order. Caesar salad not worth your time or money. Pulled pork poutine was a meal more than an appetizer and wasn't too great. Calamari was meh just like the ceasar salad so there was plenty left on the plate. Didn't try the wings so I can't comment on it. The only dish I really enjoyed with the southern fried chicken entree.   Would give this place another try but the reviews of this place did not give it justice."}
{"text":"On the east side of town this is actually a pretty big restaurant (with unfortunately not a big parking lot - more parking in the back but most likely you might have to park in the lot beside it)   Went here for a basketball game and it was about 3/4 packed (it was the long weekend so I assume people were out of town, otherwise I'm told they would have been full).  For a sports bar it really surprised me b/c it looked more like a really nice restaurant.  Plenty of seating in the back (and a pretty big patio in the front) this place did not disappoint.  We ordered some snacking food - wings, nachos and the shrimp tacos.  Everything was good but the nachos came with some weird kinda chips that weren't really made for the nachos toppings - they couldn't hold up the other ingredients well.  The wings (ordered medium spicy) and were nice but a little too saucy for me - i like my wings drier and not saucy (personal preference)   Service was friendly and pretty fast considering how busy they still were.  There are plenty of tvs around the restaurant - every seat has a good view of the screens.  There really isn't a bad spot to sit at."}
{"text":"Finally they have put a winner into the restaurant at 1660 O'Connor Drive.  This location has housed a number of different restaurants, some not so great looking, but with Rally's - it's hit the mark.  Good sized restaurant and bar area - perfect for couples, families and larger parties.  Good sized outdoor patio too!  Lots of flat screen tvs playing all kinds of sports.  They do brunch on weekends too.  But the real winner?  Their BBQ.  We have been here a couple of times, and it is always on the mark.  Our favourite?  The Pulled Pork sandwich.  Moist and flavorful we keep coming back to it.  We have tried the brisket too and would recommend it.  Sides include fries, sweet potato fries (perfect with the pulled pork!), coleslaw, homemade baked beans.   Red velvet cake with cream cheese icing makes a great sharing dessert and finishes off the deal, just right.  Still on my list to try -- the Shrimp Po' Boy, Pulled Pork Poutine, and their Southern Fried Chicken -- next time!  Prices are reasonable, parking is plentiful and the staff is always friendly and helpful.  If y'all are looking for good BBQ in a casual and comfortable setting.  You found your spot!"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with this place....daily specials, an awesome environment and a wonderful staff, oh did I say ive yet to try anything off the menu that hasn't absolutely make my head spin. Great selection of beer as well.  Great for family and will certainly return."}
{"text":"I've been three times so far, one scouting trip and a couple of times for PPV Boxing & MMA. It's an excellent layout to watch sports, practically wallpapered in TV screens with excellent lines of sight and comfortable spacing of the tables which allows ease of moving around, flagging a server and a general feeling of decent shoulder room.  The maintenance & cleanliness was excellent each time,    Menu looks good although so far I've only had the Curry Chicken Taco and shared Calamari. The food was well done and presented. look forward to trying some of the Pulled Pork options in the future.  Servers were pleasant, and attentive without hovering or being pushy.   Main drawback is the limited parking. They need to enable a few more spots parallel to the wall along the driveway which leads to the back dumpster area and to formalize an agreement for their customers to park in any unused spots of the neighboring muffler shop at night when it;s closed - altbhough people use it anyway it would be nice to have an arrangement for peace of mind that there is no chance of being tagged & towed during the permitted hours."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for the first time for winterlicious and the motivation from the great reviews on Yelp. The entire experience was perfect. Our waitress who lost her voice was very sweet, pleasant and attentive. My boyfriend ordered off the winterlicious menu while I ordered from their regular menu and everything was excellent. We ordered the chicken vegetable minestrone, meatloaf, pulled Pork Sandwich with pulled Pork Poutine, and the butterscotch dessert. We enjoyed it all and will definitely come back again. I hope the waitress will regain her voice back the next time I visit. I look forward to having the minestrone again."}
{"text":"The food is great, everything has a home made feel, the fish and chips are definitely something to check out with the dill infused batter. Lots of screens, probably a great place to watch football on a sunday"}
{"text":"Went to watch the footy on a Monday lunchtime so it wasn't very busy and lacked a bit of atmosphere but the food was good enough to earn 4 stars - Monster Burger was exceptionally well cooked. What tipped it into 5 stars was the server Megan who was really friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews here, I decided to try this place out for lunch. They only offer the \"brunch\" menu from 11am-3pm on Saturday and Sunday. I asked about the regular menu but was told it's not served until after 3pm - this was disappointing.   Ordered the Brisket Sandwich (14.00$) and substituted the fries for a poutine (additional 3.50$). My sister ordered fries and gravy (6.00$). The Brisket was smothered in BBQ sauce and the Brisket was tasty. The poutine was a huge disappointment - the fries were overly salty and I didn't feel it was very fresh. The fries my sister ordered was equally as salty. We could barely eat the fries.  Beer wise, there's a good selection of drinks but the price is higher than average. It's not worth it to get a pitcher as it's cheaper to get a pint. No complaints aside from price.   After paying for our bills, I realized they charged me 15.00$ for the Brisket sandwich instead of 14.00$ which is listed on the menu. My sister inquired about it and our server said it must be an old menu. She didn't seem bothered about it nor did she apologize, she just left.   Overall, service was pretty good for a bar but the food was disappointing. Washrooms were clean and restaurant is spacious - not sure if I would come back to try the actual menu. This was pretty disappointing to say the least."}
{"text":"Items ordered were calamari Smokehouse salad bbq wings... all were up to par We sat at the bar where there were ample televisions for viewing of sports including the Toronto Maple Leafs game and Thursday Night Football The experienced and quite funny barmaid Lacey was very prompt and professional with her service Overall this establishment warrants a another visit for sure especially during Leaf games"}
{"text":"So, Lee and I were meeting his brother, who lives in Scarborough, for a Sunday lunch. I checked Yelp ratings for something good nearby, and this one popped up. So sure, why not?  One little surprise was they actually have a brunch menu, which isn't listed on their website. This is something they should correct! Anyway, the place is nice and bright and open, with televisions everywhere, making it so that there isn't a bad seat in the house if you want to watch sports. There was a Jays game on at the time, which was a fun thing to break up the lulls in conversation. One thing I appreciated was there are even monitors and sound in the bathrooms, so if you *have* to go, you won't miss any action!  So yeah, brunch. They had both breakfasty options and lunchy options, and I opted for the pulled pork benny, because why not? Lee got a reuben, and his brother got a sandwich that honestly completely escapes my brain. :| We started out with poutine, which was pretty good, with a nice gravy and decent fries. They also have a pretty good beer menu, with some plain old options and some decent smaller options, like Mill Street.   The pulled pork benny was pretty good, but a little bit on the sweet side. Lee enjoyed his reuben, and his brother enjoyed his sandwich. This seems like it'd be a great place to watch hockey and/or spend a nice afternoon on the patio. I'd head back again for sure."}
{"text":"Service was slow. It took a while to seat us despite being half empty. We eventually got seated at a bistro table even though there were empty booths available (that also stayed empty during our dinner).   The food itself was good, nothing spectacular. There isn't much else in that area for food. We decided to try the Winterlicious menu. Started with the Mexican street corn, which was delicious. Not too filling (less toppings than La Carnita). Had the back rib trio for my main dish. It was tasty, mostly due to the sauces. Had some sort of chocolate dish for dessert. This was pretty much cold pudding with bits of nuts on top.   For $25, it was decent. I'm glad their beer menu has improved since my last visit a couple of years back. This restaurant is great for watching sports & has enough room for large groups."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was pumping and the beer was flowing last night while this sports bar filled with  dedicated Blue Jay fans. It was a great place to watch the game since the staff was very friendly and the TV screens are everywhere! The food on the other hand was not the greatest! The menu offered your standard pub food however the presentation and taste didn't really wow me. The tacos were good, I would skip the nachos even though the chips are made from scratch.... it lacked flavor. We were told that the guacamole was also made from scratch  however it was very bland. The manager did take care of our concerns which was impressive. I would recommend it for the drinks, staff and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Great smoked pork. They treat kids well. Love this local joint even for takeout. Recommended to friends and they also thought it was a great find."}
{"text":"Positives:  Great atmosphere for a game with plenty of screens Food was good - We had Tacos on half price day and were pretty happy Decent Daily deals  Negatives: Food is regularly very over priced for the quantity you get. $15 Nachos for a small plate.  Parking situation really sucks. Very small front lot and additional parking is unorganized and haphazard.  Location isn't the easiest to get to. You have to drive to it, as transit is no where near it."}
{"text":"We watched the Raptors game on Victoria Day at Rally, and the atmosphere in the bar was buzzing. They have 25+ television screens playing sports so anywhere your head turns you'll get to see \"a sport\" (well, except the floor, there you'll only see your feet). We had a nachos platter to share for 2 people and it was topped with beans, chili, black olives, cheese, sour cream and salsa.  Get there early on game nights to find parking, otherwise, park next to the shrubs.  *** I'd give service and bathrooms a 2-3 stars because they were understaffed, and on that night, the Ladies room was closed so we used the kitchen backdoor staff bathroom----which was a storage/wetroom/not for the public eye."}
{"text":"Always a great place to go to watch a sporting event.  In this case, Saturday night to celebrate a friends birthday, watch the Raptors game and pay tribute to the friends' brother who had passed that week.  A cozy, chilled, easy environment to hang out with friends regardless of what's going on.  A sports bar with delicious food--always a plus.  This place is large and can cater to large groups.  Love the buttermilk fried chicken here  sweet potato fries and macaroni salad.  Also tried their apple crumble (a bit too sweet) with vanilla ice cream .  The waitresses are friendly, lots of drink options.    Free wifi available   Sometimes they have special nights where you pay $35 for unlimited pub food (buffet style) and watch a UFC event or a large event they cater to."}
{"text":"The food was okay.  Nothing really stood out as good or bad.  The waitress was really nice and attentive.  It wasn't busy the night we went so we had a nice conversation with the waitress.  I wish I could give a more detailed review but nothing really stood out.  I had the soup and salad.  They was okay but nothing outstanding."}
{"text":"If I am coming to Rally Sports Bar to catch a game... I would not have been disappointed.  - Doesn't matter where you are seated, you will able to watch the game - You would not miss anything even you have too much to drink and need to go washroom often as there are even TV in the washroom - The huge huge TV in the main area at the back is great to catch a playoff game or even UFC (I think they can curtained that section off when showing UFC event)  If I am coming to Rally Sports Bar to eat.. I would not have been disappointed.  - Rally is really a Smokehouse.. if you are in to BBQ and a meat lover..  - The Sliders ($12) I ordered are so delicious...  - Beef Briskets is soft and tender with just enough \"fat\" - Pulled Pork is not all dried out... still soft and moist and have the right amount of BBQ sauce - Beef Burger is good on it's own but fail when served on the same plate with the others - The mixed salad though has no dressing at all? Maybe it is for decoration purposes? I feel like a rabbit when I was eating those.... Maybe they should just skip that or just replace it with some home fries?    If I am coming to Rally Sports Bar to eat... I would not have been disappointed.  - 13 draft beers available on tap - great selections of Martini ($5 Martini specials and 1/2 apps Friday after 10 pm) - Mixed drinks.. The Pomegranate Mojito ($6.25) is A-OK...   If you are coming to Rally Sports Bar for the smoking hot waitresses in shorts... you would not be disappointed either...  I just want to come back for a real meal: Ribs, Home Smoked Pork Belly..and just more meat! Pile them on!!"}
{"text":"Quality food and original recipes. Friendly staff. Exceptional pub. All the TV'S you need and they are happy put on what you want."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night with hubby because we were craving ribs.  The place wasn't really busy.  Ribs came with coleslaw and fries.  The ribs were good, the fries were ok, the coleslaw not so great.  For two beers and dinner the bill came to $80 with tip.  Service was not inspiring but I've had worse.  Would probably go back the rest of the menu looked pretty good."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for games night. Service was good every time I went. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"I came here again to treat my mom. I ordered the beef brisket sandwich again as I liked it that much last time! My mom ordered the roasted beet salad and fish and chips with tarter sauce and cole slaw. We felt the roasted beet salad was nothing special as it wasn't too flavorful. There weren't too many beets though the goat cheese was creamy and the walnuts gave a crunch. The fish and chips on the other hand was a big hit among us! The fish was battered really nicely and it was so flavourful especially paired with the delicious tarter sauce and cole slaw! The fries were freshly made and it was delicious! Lastly we ordered the Apple Crisp with bourbon icecream. My mom really enjoyed it as she is a fan of tarte soft apples paired with cinnoman and oat crust! I personally wasn't a huge fan of the apple crisp, i felt that it could of been sweeter with less cinnoman and I wish the crust on top had more of a crunch, instead it was soggy which was dissappointing! Other then that, it was a great experience again! Great customer service as usual and great food!"}
{"text":"I was quite impressed with Rally Sports Bar. It has excellent ambiance, lots of space, large TVs and screen, friendly service and a variety of delicious food.   I had the Atlantic salmon, which was a delightfully tasty, filling and well-balanced entrée. I even availed of a free tuna fish taco Yelp promo, and it was fantastic. I'd definitely come back to try their other burgers and entrées.   I came here on a Saturday night, and it was half packed. They were quick to set up a table for us and we had one of the friendliest services.   Great place for after work drinks, regular eat outs, or even large parties. Parking is adequate."}
