{"text":"Had the 15-20 person catering pavkage last night. Lots of food! Freshly made. On time. Delicious!! Everyone loved it and plan to return."}
{"text":"The food is delicious here. We have ate from here a few times and their food has always been great. It's a little greasy and salty, but it's so good - as long as it's not a daily thing you're fine. 

My issues are their phone etiquette and flyer ads... I live around the corner from Martins and have tried to order twice and both times they have told me no. Once they told me no because of the weather and another they told me they don't deliver during rush hour, but they also couldn't tell me when rush hour will end. 
They're phone etiquette leaves something to be desired as well. They're not rude but they're definitely not friendly either. Hanging up before saying hello, no thank you for calling martins... 

I have ordered from their catering menu in the past as well and they were a huge hit. I ordered a small potato with 80 pieces and it didn't last long at all. It was the first thing gone at our party! 

So while I will order again, I hope this review sheds some light where it can be improved."}
{"text":"Probably the best Portuguese chicken around. Always made fresh. 

Very friendly owners always great you with a smile. Good place to grab a quick bite or sit back with a few beers and watch soccer. 

They also cater! 

Will return again."}
{"text":"To be honest, I've only ordered the takeout Portuguese chicken - so you can take this review for what it is since it hardly covers most of what they serve. Anyway, it's pretty reliable takeout chicken at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Was craving Portuguese chicken. Thought this would be a good option. I'm not for giving bad reviews- but my meal was disappointing & gross! Their hot sauce sucks even more than their chicken and rice. 

I've yet to find a good chicken place in Brampton."}
{"text":"Got the half chicken dinner, came with rice and potatoes. Chicken was great, rice wasn't bad, potatoes were good. Quick service, good customer service. Definitely recommend this for anyone looking to eat some good food in Brampton."}
{"text":"Service was Amazing! The guy working there definitely has a sense of humour, he even hooked me up with extra goodies and sauce! The chicken is Amazing. You need to try the chicken and the round potatoes. The rice even had flavor, I cleaned up my whole plate. I am definitely going to be a Regular here and it takes a lot for me to be a regular anywhere, regardless. They did not disappoint me at all, and I was skeptical to try it, thank goodness I did. This place definitely is a Gem in the Brampton area, please do not hesitate and try the food. I got the Family deal pack. I enjoyed it so much, I'm happy right now. I literally just finished eating, but they deserve this review. They better not go down it quality like a lot of good restaurants do when they think it's okay, just because they made there reputation.. oh nononono"}
{"text":"Have to say that chicken is always fresh and super tasty. Small portion of rice and potatoes (which is the perfect amount) loaded with a half chicken! Customer service is whatever but, beautiful char grilled food chicken!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that Yelp let me down more than anything....
Soooo.... They had no potatoes, so we got veggies and a side of fries in lieu, they gave us large we PAYED for medium, great!  We get home and find chicken was not fresh, but I understand, it was late... Fries tasted of burnt oil, rice was undercooked and cold... But the kicker, we ordered two chickens and upon dividing up the legs between us all, we noticed there were only three, 3 legs!!! Went ahead and counted the wings, 3 wings!  Really!?!  And they had the audacity of charging me for the fries....  Big big big disappointment... Needless to say, will never go back, even though we were offered a credit"}
