{"text":"Very friendly wait staff! The pad thai was flavorful and filled with tasty fixings. The menu was extensive and has options for everyone. We tried the dragon roll with eel sauce and it was very tasty as well! For $10, you definitely get your money's worth and 2 meals out of it! Stop in and give this place a try!"}
{"text":"The food was very high quality! I ordered some simple rolls, the Philly and the spicy salmon, because I just wanted a light lunch on the cheap. Even these basic rolls were given attention by the chef, they were very flavorful. The miso soup was robust and the ginger salad dressing was creamy and not overpowering. The linens on the tables give the place a high end vibe that doesn't seem to fit the restaurant, and the wait staff seemed a little disorganized, but I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"I can only speak for the hunan side of the menu, but the dishes we had were excellent, fresh, spicy and well-balanced."}
{"text":"I just visited Koi today while in town seeing museums and from my experience it was just okay. The rolls were a bit dry for my liking, overall it was just so so. I also hope they pay more attention to detailed cleaning as they go. Service was a little slow, I ordered a tea upon being seated and she never brought it, mind you I was 1 of about 5 people. I ordered again with a different waitress.   I will not be returning solely based on my satisfaction of the sushi. Maybe I just had a random bad visit?."}
{"text":"Delivery is quick. Boiled sliced fish and whole fish dry pot are good choice if u like  hot dishes."}
{"text":"The service here was terrible. My companion got his food several minutes before they brought mine out. I ordered the vegetable tempura entree which was supposed to come with miso soup, rice and salad but I only ever received the tempura (which wasn't that great). The waitress never once came back to see how everything was. We waited and waited and waited for the check and finally just had to go up to pay. I told them I didn't receive all the food I ordered and could they please take some money off and they started arguing with me and being rude! No apology at all. Finally we just paid and left. This place is terrible and I will not be back!"}
{"text":"Got a lunch special that was mediocre. Miso was watery and they did not include utensils. Poor costumer service when there was an issue with our order. Overall I would patron one of the other Sushi establishments over Koi."}
{"text":"Koi sushi ?  Are they serving fresh Koi(Carp)fish ? No, serving mainly Chinese food plus Chinese made  Sushi. Sick and Tired for \"Copied Japanese Style Sushi\".  We ordered Sashimi(sliced of Various of fresh fish but what they serve was slice of fish on the Golf ball size rice ball. Needed number 1 wood club to eat their like sushi  golf ball.   Pings makes lots better one."}
{"text":"Guys-- this isn't really a sushi place. It's a super tasty Hunan Chinese restaurant. I meandered in despite the poor yelp reviews because it seemed like many of them were 1-star 1 review haters perhaps hired by the competition across the street. I'm really glad I did.  My first impression was that this was a legit authentic Chinese restaurant. The four other full tables were all speaking mandarin and eating awesome looking spicy Chinese food. After spending a year in western china I'm always on the lookout for good Chinese places and have so far been disappointed by state street options. (Zen Zen taste, Mini Hot Pot, and Double Ten were all better choices than the fare found closer to campus.) When presented with the menu my suspicions were confirmed-- 1/4 Japanese including sushi, 1/4 American Chinese, and 50% Hunanese.   Feeling intimidated by Hunan food? Any of the twice cooked pork dishes are probably good. I enjoyed mine with green beans. It was also one of the more affordable things on the menu at $13. Another safe bet if you don't fear spicy food are the dry pots. Finally, the sour stir fried potato is one of my favorite things from China that hasn't quite caught on with Americans yet. It's crunch and salty and sour in all the best ways possible. If you are feeling adventurous, the whole fish the people at the next table were eating looked pretty good, though I can't vouch for it personally.  As with most Chinese restaurants \"entree\" that has starch, protein, and vegetable isn't really a central concept. So come with friends and choose some meats, fishes, and vegetables so you end up a balanced meal.  One notable downside is that the menu is a little pricey, though the dishes are big.  Long story short--  I'll be coming back and you should give this place a try. Just skip the sushi and order from the part of the menu that represents food from the culture that the chefs and servers are part of."}
{"text":"Worst chinese/Japanese place ever. All their food was salty and the sushi tasted old. I would never go back and wouldn't recommend anybody."}
{"text":"I had the beef hibachi. It was a little pricey compared to other place. The flavor wasn't bad but a little bland. My companion had some spicy fish. I had 1 bite and couldn't eat any more. It's okay if you like spicy food. I'd probably go back again."}
{"text":"I ordered the beef pad Thai and it clearly wasn't. They served me Udon noodles with different vegetables. The one ingredient they had in common was a few pieces of cabbage. One of my friend's rolls didn't come and my other friend received the wrong roll even after clarifying for the second time. It was also much very expensive, especially for the quality. Service was not good at all. We had to ask for our orders multiple times because they forgot to put them in several times. They don't seem to understand English very well either. Would give one star but the miso soup was good."}
{"text":"This is a Hunan restaurant with sushi available. Our group of 12 was from all over the world, but mostly the SF Bay Area (with folks that were from or lived in China) was blown away by the delicious food. Sichuan and Hunan dishes were perfect. We ordered probably 15 different dishes, plus appetizers. Excellent, excellent food. Hope they are still around when we return in May 2018. Highly recommended if you want authentic Hunan or Sichuan."}
{"text":"Got sick from the food and the experience I had with a delivery order tonight was really below par.   Ordered some sushi items and didn't feel well after eating the avocado roll, which is strange because that's actually cooked.   They forgot a missing item and I call them to request that they re-deliver. After initially agreeing, they call back and tell me that their delivery person was done for the night. They offered me a refund. Fine but now one person in my house has to go without food. The part that bothers me is that their delivery was actually still available.    Their attitude on the phone is one of total indifference. They just don't seem to care at all about providing anything beyond the minimum."}
{"text":"This is a Hunan style food. Yelp has marked it wrong with Szechuan/Japanese. We were walking around downtown for a bite and found this place with a huge grand opening sign. This is where the American Apparel store used to be.   It's was pretty empty when we entered. The service was fast and courteous. While we were there, the tables started filling. We ordered a gyoza, miso soup, shredded beef with celery, family style pork and beans and eggplant. I was very pleasantly surprised with the shredded beef with celery. If u don't like Szechuan pepper corns but love the usual Chinese beef dish, this is the one for u.   It is lightly spiced as compared to usual Szechuan style. It was a good change.   I did not try any of their rolls. I would want to come back again for their Japanese food."}
{"text":"Got sushi delivered.  Was middlin.  No wasabi on side or on sushi, which was a bummer."}
{"text":"With apologies to other Chinese restaurants on State Street, this one is now my favorite. I have never tried the Sushi here so I'm afraid I cant weigh in on that part of the menu. When we come here, we generally stick to the Hunan options. We really like the crispy beef (thin slices, salty, really flavorful), the chicken with chilli oil (salty and mouth numbingly spicy with all the great flavors), and some sauteed on choy for our veggies. I should say that it's the urge for the mouth numbing spices that usually makes me crave this place in the first place.  We really enjoy sharing a meal with friends here. The food is filling. The prices are more than fair. We can almost always find a table. The service is mostly good. We never feel rushed. Sometimes when they are busy you will have to be a little patient, but everyone is friendly and doing their best. Delivery is pretty quick too if that's what you are looking for."}
{"text":"Excellent dinner. I had Sushi, hot sour soup an Pad Thai. Interior looks elegant with white table clothes, maroon clothe napkins and floors are a dark red wood color. They have a big variety on the menu to choose from. You'll enjoy this place."}
{"text":"Service may not be the best during busy hours, but (non-sushi) food is spicy, authentic and satisfying.  I haven't tried sushi here yet, but a friend said it's okay for its price."}
{"text":"My husband and I had an unforgettable road trip from New Jersey to Wisconsin to visit relatives over the Holidays; on our way, we had a chance to spend time in Cleveland, Ohio where we visited \"The Christmas Story,\" (our family's favorite holiday movie) Museum and house where the movie was filmed; little did we know that we would be spending Christmas Day in Madison, WI having dinner at a Chinese restaurant!!! Koi Sushi, a Chinese/Japanese restaurant by the Capitol that is where we dined!!!  Besides being a holiday, the day was brutally cold!!! We found ourselves tired, cold and starving after exploring mostly outdoors Madison; following Yelp's advice we stumbled into this place which appeared to be the only one open in all downtown!!!  Another couple had beat us in and were the only other company besides the staff.  After removing tons of clothing layers, we settled and were promptly served hot tea!!!  Oh, my!!! Even the tea was glorious!!!  Koi's menu is long since they offer both types of cuisines; we took our time, enjoying the tea, the warmth and guess???  The Christmas Story movie on TV!!!!  For starters, my husband ordered Miso Soup and I, Hot and Sour Soup; both came out of the kitchen hot and delicious!  The portions were larger than we expected but never less we managed to finish them.  As main, my husband chose Hot and Spicy Fish and I had Hunan Duck, both dishes came accompanied by white rice.   Again, the dishes' portions were huge!!!  The fish dish was a crisp white fish fillet smothered in what tasted like General Tso's sauce, (spicy, sweet)... not a bad combination but overwhelming.. The duck dish was unexpected; we thought we would be getting the traditional whole duck however we got a casserole of stew duck pieces which is by far the best duck dish ever tasted!!!  We took our time but we managed to finish the entire meal!!  It was glorious!!!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food on the Hunan food.  Had the eggplant and string beans which was very good, but the fish with sour cabbage casserole was amazing.  Great combination of spicy, sour and salty."}
{"text":"Stopped by spontaneously on my way home from a friend's and was at first turned off to see only three of the ~20 tables were filled but I am a huge fan of sushi and am always trying to find more economical options in Madison so I figured I would give it a try and order some takeout. I ordered two roles, and within about ten minutes they were ready which I thought was incredibly fast considering I just walked in off the street. It was a reasonable price and considering how good they were I was impressed. The fish tasted very fresh and the avocado was perfectly ripe so I'd say I was completely satisfied. I hope that they will start delivering because I live far away and I could eat their sushi every night."}
{"text":"Just paid $30 for two rolls and a beer. Couldn't read the check. Menu was 9 Point font, hundreds of choices. Nothing special ... everything was almost OK."}
{"text":"Koi is going to be a tough sell on State Street.  Without an alcohol license (at the present time), the food and service really needs to stand out in order to drive customers here vs. one of several other asian restaurants in the area.  Unfortunately, it is a tough swim upstream for Koi.  Interior wise, the decor is lacking.  Nary a picture on the wall and the table numbers (i.e. B-5) are pasted on the wall or chairs to help the servers.  It must have not have worked as we had 3 different servers at our table at some point throughout the meal.  Their menu is large and diverse with both traditional and american chinese entrees along with sushi.  I would not get the sushi again.  The rolls were assembled sloppily and constructed with dry sushi rice.  Our two entrees (sesame chicken and szechuan chicken) were somewhat better.  Of the two, the spicy chicken won out with lots of dried peppers and the numbing bite of szechuan peppercorn.   Yes, the restaurant is relatively new but with the amount of competition and the lack of alchohol to help smooth out some of the kitchen missteps, I doubt we would be repeat customers."}
{"text":"I used to love this place, although their food is extremely salty, but I would order half salt and it'd be fine. However, this particular time, I ordered one of their dishes and, per usual, requested less salt. Turned out, I had to send it back and the second plate they gave me was equally salty; SO SALTY that it numbed my tongue. I refused to eat it and asked the owner to remake it and he said he would give me a new one but never did. The service was horrible, my party waited so long for their food. When it came to me paying, I refused to pay for the salty plate because I didn't even touch it. The owner gave me some major attitude because I didn't eat their food and refused to pay for 1000g of sodium they gave me. I will never come back and they know they probably just lost one of their most regular customers."}
{"text":"Way over priced.   But I get it. They have to pay the rent. It is a really cool place and the sushi is super good too. I did notice however they charge $6 for 6 pieces in the California roll and the crab meat is imitation.   I'll be back though. At the end of the month when I get paid..."}
{"text":"The food is good, came in adequate time. I've finished my meal 15 minutes ago and still haven't been asked how my food was, if I wanted anything else, or if I was ready for my bill. I waited a total of 45 minutes for my bill before I walked toward the door, and told them I could have walked out but chose not to. All the other Waiters have addressed other clientele that came after I did, with their bill and made frequent stops at other tables after those customers got their food. The only difference between me and all the other 7 occupied tables..... I'm the only Caucasian person inside this restaurant amongst all Asian staff and other customers..... I will not be coming back here again."}
{"text":"I really thought this place was going to be the new spot for sushi downtown but was quickly disappointed once we sat down with our menus.   The menus consist of a small selection of sushi and a LARGE selection of Chinese cuisine. I mean, if the restaurant is called Koi Sushi, you would think that they specialize more in sushi, right? Wrong.   We ordered sushi, I believe I ordered the spicy tuna and their udon and I was disappointed. The udon looked sad and the nori on the sushi was very chewy.  Long story short, misleading name, bad sushi."}
{"text":"When it comes down to the food and service, this place is definitely a solid 4 stars at LEAST. I thoroughly enjoyed the sushi - got an Alaskan roll and spicy salmon roll and both were better than what I would expect to find in Madison! The prices were great for the quality of sushi, in my opinion.  The ambience could definitely use some work - the restaurant is spacious but I've never seen it more than half filled, so I'm worried about their business...the decor is pretty standard and their round tables are much more suited for Chinese family-style dishes. Nothing jumps out in this department, but again, the quality of food and service more than make up for this.  I think this restaurant has great potential, given that it's only been open for a few weeks! I wouldn't expect the decor and ambience to blow me away or anything, but the food and service was certainly impressive.  I hope more people check this place out and enjoy it cause I think it's definitely better than most other competitors in the area (i.e. Wasabi). Give it a try even if it's empty!"}
{"text":"We picked this because of lent and were not disappointed.... the lunch special was amazing!! The miso  was wonderful and my daughter had the ginger salad and she was very happy!! Rolls were exactly what we expected and the staff was very accommodating!!"}
{"text":"Delivery took an hour and 15 minutes and the food was cold upon arrival. I got crab rangoon, miso soup, and the spicy tuna roll. None of it was especially good or bad, but given the long delivery time and cool, soggy crab rangoon, I probably won't order from here again."}
{"text":"I've had better and I've had worse. They only recently opened up, so it's understandable that the interior lacked decoration. They should work to get the ambiance up to speed! It's very important.  I ordered a eel avocado roll and tuna sashimi. They were both tasty, though the sashimi was a little small. Their specialty rolls were a little pricey, but the amount you get makes up for the cost.   Overall, their menu is very, very big. You can probably find something you want to eat on it, though can you still call it a sushi place if the sushi only makes up a fraction of the menu? I'll let you decide."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery, came in a timely manner, the miso soup was still hot! Sushi was delicious and well made, not priced too bad either."}
{"text":"I was taking a power walk down State Street and noticed the sign for \"Koi Sushi Grand Opening .\"  Although it was 2 pm I hadn't eaten lunch so I stopped to check it out. Surprisingly for a campus restaurant the tables had cloth table cloths. I ordered the Kung Pao Beef lunch special which arrived quickly and piping hot, accompanied by a large bowl of rice. The vegetables were perfect and seasoning was just right. The beef was slightly chewy and I would have preferred less cooking oil. Never-the-less a more than satisfactory Chinese lunch, especially for $8. Wait staff was all Asian during the off hour I was there and very attentive. They have a Japanese menu in addition to the Chinese menu (called \"American\"???)"}
{"text":"Great Sushi and Great Chinese.  The Chinese was a little salty, but even the 'American' Chinese used some great authentic Chinese ingredients.  Selection of authentic Chinese alongside 'American' Chinese and Sushi is really cool.  Lunch special sushi was phenomenal for the price - Fresh tasting eel and Yellowtail.  The flavors really 'popped' for the standard-fare rolls we ordered.  We will be back.  Also, some reviewers unfairly dinged Koi for not having an alcohol license.  I guess it is a fair thing to point out - I love me some Sake too, but I happened to be ordering lunch carryout on a workday.  Liquor license issues are city hall's fault.  The place seems very new and was not at all busy when I went (off-peak hours), but I suspect as more people try it that could change.  I know there is lots of good competition, but this place really stands out."}
{"text":"Pretty standard Asian fare. got the chef selection sushi and it was decent.  It's at a great location.  The staff are very very friendly and they casually gave me the remote when I asked them if they can switch one of the TVs to the packer game.  They give you a soup and a salad to start off."}
{"text":"To start with, know that this is NOT a sushi restaurant (although it is confusingly in the name). It has sushi, but that is not its specialty and should not be what draws you in. This is a good authentic Hunan Chinese restaurant. Many of my Chinese friends consider this one of the best restaurants in Madison. The food is great and the variety is huge. The place just opened so the inside is obviously still being worked on, but the potential is there and I truly recommend you give it a try."}
