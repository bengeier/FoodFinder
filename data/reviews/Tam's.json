{"text":"The food is as original as it gets..
Try the garlic wings..... and the pork fried rice..
Best egg rolls on the west coast, hands down..
greasy food when it's needed, amazing flavors that remind you of when food was good.. 

it is a very ghetto establishment, pick up only, no tables, but when you get there, you will see why..

just grab the amazing food and go!!! 

you will thank me later for the amazing food..."}
{"text":"In a never ending quest to find new lunch spots me and a coworker stumbled upon this place. Hearing it from another person we were originally looking for somewhere else.

Overall I thought the food was excellent. A generous portion, and a price you can't beat. A little difficult to order but got exactly what we wanted. Only problem I can see is no where to sit. So you have to take it to go. Still worth it."}
{"text":"Great food, good service - I had Sesame Chicken lunch special - Reminds me of Chinese food back in Chi-Town.  Excellent value for the $, but maybe the person answering the phone could have a bit less attitude, ;-)"}
{"text":"This place is disgusting. My friends found a baby hairless mouse in their fried rice. Gross, I will never eat there again."}
{"text":"I am not sure what the hype is but my pork fried rice was burnt and my order was wrong. I gave it one star for the jalape√±o chicken because it was alright however it did not wow me...I won't be going back. Truly disappointed."}
{"text":"Coworkers continued to talk about the Jalapeno Chicken. Went to give it a try & omg by far the best I've ever had!! Will be going back again. Worth the trip & price!"}
{"text":"Where else can you get Jalapeno fried chicken? Nowhere but hood spots! Also, their Shrimp Fried rice is not to be missed- certainly some of the best I've had with decent sized shrimp! Is this place a dive? Heck yes! As a matter of fact, there is only a pick-up window with a lady yelling at you in broken English. I also recommend the Egg Foo Yung here and the Kung Pao shrimp. This is the type of place that leaves grease stains on the paper bag!  I highly recommend calling in your order and then waiting 15 minutes to pick it up. Sometimes when I pick-up my order it feels like I'm doing some sort of shady drug deal, but trust me this place is legit!"}
{"text":"Amazing Garlic Chicken Wings.  Truly amazing.  This joint does not get any more humble.  The sign on the road merely says \"Chinese Food\" in both English and Spanish.  It doesn't even say Tams.  There are no tables.  It's literally a hole in a wall.  Get out of your car, walk up to the hole in the wall, place your order, wait 10 minutes, grab your goodies and drive away.  The menu has all the favorites you would expect  but you want to get the chicken wings. (Many different flavors available.. we got garlic).  They're part southern fried chicken, part chicken wing (you get the whole wing - not just 'paddles' and 'drums\") and part chinese food.  Chinese Soul food indeed, and perhaps the best wings in town.  We also had the chicken egg foo young and it was superb.  The egg roll was big, thick and loaded with goodies.  It was also dripping with grease.... I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing.  Anyway, I ate all of it and it was pretty darn tasty.  Unless you're packing, I would go to Tams during daylight.  The neighborhood is tough.  Try Tam's.  It's amazing."}
{"text":"Would have never guessed. Looked like a whole in the wall. Food came out and it was bomb!"}
{"text":"I don't really give five stars but it SAYS as good as it gets... which is true because the Chinese American food in Phoenix is wack. Very tasteless and the rice is disgusting at most places. BUT THIS PLACE?! It takes me back to St. Louis (my hometown) it's not as good but its good for being in Phoenix. I know good Chinese food and this is IT. If you live close... and even if you don't I think it's worth the drive if your craving it enough. It's extremely ghetto. A true hole in the wall PLEASE do not expect much when you go here. It's the results when your eating that are worth it. If you go off an establishment by looks then this place may not be for you. But if you can get past the looks I'm sure you won't be disappointed. I ordered the shrimp fried rice and regular wings each time. I ALWAYS call ahead, and they usually have my food ready when I get there. Again it is a true hole in the wall so don't be alarmed. But its cheap and it's good. 

Oh and I am SURE it's cash only. It just doesn't seem like a place with a CC machine."}
{"text":"Jalapeno Chicken Wings, Fried Rice, and Egg rolls. That's all I ever order for the past 5 years, AND THIS IS THE BEST IN PHOENIX! Don't be fooled by it's appearance, you will live this place. I'm a Bostonian lived in New York too, this place is real Chinese food, real grease, really good"}
{"text":"Tam's was recommended to me by a couple of my coworkers. After looking it up on Yelp and seeing that it got good reviews I thought I would give it a try. I ordered the Mongolian beef it was delightfully good I found the meal to be really good especially for the price which came in under $6 for the lunch special. The rice was a little different not exactly what I'm accustomed to as fried rice. But they state that they serve Mexican and oriental food here and it seem to be a little more towards a Spanish rice than a fried rice however it went well with the meal. The meal came with a wonton and an egg roll the wonton was a little hard but the egg roll was fantastic. I gave Tams four stars for the money it's definitely worth it the parking lot will scare you but avoid getting turned off by it and go ahead and try it I think you'll really enjoy it"}
{"text":"It's really not the best value. Prices are on the low end for Chinese food but so is the taste and quality. Matter of fact prices I feel should be lower for what they are serving. 

Tried it a 2nd time.. Got the same impression... There's better value to be had elsewhere."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place pit because of how close it is to my job. Ironically my students have been talking so highly about Tams that I had to see what the hype was about.  Great price for the amount of food that you get. The food is fresh and not as generic as a big chain Chinese place. I highly recommend at least trying it for a quick pick me up. The building is not much for the eyes but I have found that these are some of the best places. This place gets the yelp from me. Lol."}
{"text":"I would give it 3.5 stars if I could. Now on the details:

The good: I ordered the small/regular Chicken and Snow Peas with steamed rice. It WAS amazing! Really truly loved it. I normally go for stronger sauces (think soy and teriyaki) but this light sauce was just the right amount of wonderful. And for about $5?! That makes me smile.

The bad: Seriously bad location and their sign is pretty faded and say \"Tam's Mexican food\" on it? I was like HUH?? Oh well, despite this I managed to find it. It is truly a hole in the wall that you walk up to, order, and then wait in the stifling heat for your food. And while I didn't get sick, I sort of doubt that all the health codes are being followed. 

The really bad: I also ordered fried wontons, 12 for about $3. When I ordered them the girl at the counter went back and forth with me about crab puffs versus wontons? I said WONTONS not CRAB PUFFS because I'm allergic to crab! Okay so I get home with my food and pull out the TINY wontons. Last time I checked wontons had meat wrapped up in them. These did not and I was really annoyed. I paid $3 for 12 plain fried noodles.Yeah...not good at all. 

All in all, barring the wontons, I would go back there to get food if I was in a hurry. Better choice than Panda Express or any of the other chain chinese food stores."}
{"text":"Went here with my father-in-law after a twilight session of golf. Sketch neighborhood after dark....but we had a back up plan in case of any trouble. Seriously. 

Great chinese, though!

Side note: Bring extra couple of bucks for the \"street walkers.\""}
{"text":"Best Chinese food I had yet being from los Angeles, its in the hood like Louisiana chicken on Manchester & Normandie. Had shrimp fried rice that was good and well balance between rice shrimp, orange chicken that was better to me then pandas, eggs rolls was better then average they was good.When it come to that fried plain chicken Omg slap who's ever with you good sorry baby. :Dlol"}
{"text":"Chicken fu young is AMAZING, the gravey over the meal is delicious and they give plenty. Second fave is the Jalapeno wings, first time I tried them it was alright. They put the jalapenos on the bottom of the brown paper bag. Gave them another shot, and the jalapenos were on top....shook that bag and devoured the wings! I have tried other dishes but not super impressed by the garlicky wings, the fried rice is not very flavorful.....But those wings though...with the Fu Young.....maaaannn"}
{"text":"This is a local (hood) favorite.  You must get the wings! They come in 4 complete wing per order. Secret: Tell them to put hot sauce on your wings after your order is ready.  Not drumettes like most other places.  The Chinese food is great.  We come from the Goodyear/Buckeye area and its well worth the trip.  You sit in your car and wait for your order.  It might not win with the local health department but, these Chinese immigrants do what they do well."}
{"text":"I had never heard of Tam's until one of my best friends kept talking about this fabulous little hole in the wall of a place. I'm glad she did. Better yet, I'm happy she decided to pick up some Tam's and head over to my place for dinner.  I gotta admit that Mona is right about Tam's serving up the 'best blackenese chinese soul food' in town. For real****

Best chicken wings. I love their egg foo young w/chicken gravy! Yummers. I will definitely keep this place in mind for the future. I've yet to actually pick up an order from this place but if it tastes just like what I had when Mona brought a bit of Tam's to our house, then it's definitely worth the drive. Five Stars, Baby!"}
{"text":"I do not understand what all the fuss is about!

My son chose to get take out from here for his 12th birthday.  I won't likely ever order food from here again.

He ordered the combination plate #6- Chicken Chow Mein, Chicken Fried rice, Sweet & Sour Chicken and one egg roll for $7.85.  He liked it.  The serving size was HUGE.  You could easily feed two people.  

I also ordered vegetable egg fu yung.  I was told it is vegetarian.  At first I wasn't thrilled with it but each bite grew on me more.  I liked it.  However, all the food was so greasy and unhealthy that I wouldn't choose to eat it again.

We ordered egg rolls and my husband said this was his favorite thing.

We got the garlic chicken wings.  Hugs chicken wings not what I usually get.  However, they were unbelievably greasy.

We got the vegetable lo mein.  Very black peppery and not very many vegetables.  I didn't like it.

The last thing we ordered was the vegetable fried rice.  Boring.

The total bill was $31.  Enough food to feed 7 people at least.  We had tons of leftovers and no one is really wanting to eat them."}
{"text":"$4 for a pint, I ordered chicken fried rice, and alBest  hole in the wall chinese food place in South Phoenix!"}
{"text":"This is currently my fave Chinese joint in town! Don't judge a book by its cover.. I'm a vegetarian & have been in search of a veggie lo mein.. perfect combo of noodles & produce, with a side of delicious plain fried rice. (I had to skip, but I've heard their pork fried rice is to die for). I even came back for seconds the next day!"}
{"text":"great food you cant see cooked, and the woman yells literally. no respect for the location they are in. several times they have talked about boycotting this place....."}
{"text":"The presentation is not the best but the food is good. I drive way from El Mirage to get this food. The shrimp egg foo young is delicious."}
{"text":"I love the chicken wings and the shrimp rolls, shrimp lo mein my husband loves the teriyaki chicken. They're always pretty busy but worth it. I just wish they had a sitting area thats the only thing that sucks"}
{"text":"Being a business owner myself, I have always lived by the mantra that the customer is always right. This is definitely not the case with this business. I have a video production company and my crew of 2 contractors is working today at the KROC's Boy's and Girls Club literally across the street from this place. I'm currently in New York over the holidays so I'm doing my best to provide them lunch the best I can with the resources available to me. And being that I searched for \"delivery\" on Yelp and this place has a \"yes\" under delivery, I would assume I could get the food delivered. That wasn't the case today. The person that answered the phone said \"No delivery driver today\". Like, what? Is there a schedule for when I can get delivery and when I can't? So, whatever, no problem. I said, that's fine, I'll just order the food and have one of my guys come pick it up real quick. I told him the situation and I asked if I could just pay for the food over the phone since I wasn't in the area and I needed to get these guys lunch. He said \"No, we don't do that.\" Ok, so if someone orders delivery from you guys (on the on days for delivery at that), I'm sure they take the credit card over the phone and get it dropped off no problem, as I'm sure the delivery drivers don't walk around with credit card swipers. Long story short, this guy obviously didn't want my business because he was the most un-accomidating POS as I tried endlessly to find a solution without having these guys come out of their pockets to pay for a meal that me as the business owner should be providing them. It's a shame too because we have a contract for the next year where we'll be filming at that location one weekend a month which could have equaled some good business for these people over the year, but, being less than a smart business man, this person didn't see it that way. It's crazy to me too because our business isn't even a consumer based company and I can sit on my couch at my house and take credit card from my clients over my phone like nothing, and these guys act like it's no big deal to turn away clients. If you need some delivery, don't even bother reaching out to Tam's. If you're local and are going to eat at this shop, do me a favor and slap this guy squarely across the top of his head for me. Happy days!"}
{"text":"This place is what I call hidden gem. Like the kind of gem where you need to dig miles and miles below the earth core before you find this shiny gem. The place is on a very remote area of phoenix. Not only is this very hard to fins- there is basically nothing next to it, its also very hidden, only able to find because of yelp. I was shocked when we found this place cause it looks like they have a ton of patrons and the flow of orders are none stop. The last time we went( yes I have visited multiple times) I have tried several foods that they offer and to tell you that each one of those food did left my taste buds very satisfied is a understatement.

Try it. And keep tell your friends to try it too. So that this gem can be discovered by others. Its a shame that a lot don't know this place.

:)"}
{"text":"Huge portions. Quality is ok. Nothing impressive but it will feed you for cheap. A little slow to get the order, considering you have to stand outside without shade and order through a small window."}
{"text":"Gosh my heart is torn, I love the wings but the wait time is insane. 

Tams is located in south phoenix right off of the I-10. Tams appears to be a house barred up in a small parking lot. You park and walk up to the window and order. The restraint doubles as a convince market for the area, you can get smokes and milk with your Chinese food.. 

Great place but I have tried on several occasions to plan ahead but always arrive and have to wait upwards of an hour to get my food. 

The seedy area doesn't bother me much, the non-existent seating is not a deal breaker but waiting over an hour total from phone order is insane.

Feed me Tam's .... Feed meeee"}
{"text":"Sand F. said it right. I used to frequent this joint every week for several years back in 1999/2000. Glad to see they are there still. 

Excellent unique food. Try a slappy bag."}
{"text":"It was cool. Midwest Chinese food is hard to compete with...but I guess it is running third place. My hubby got the orange chicken and he said he'd get it again and that's shocking. I had sweet and sour chicken with fried rice. Nothing to call home about...the chicken didn't look appetizing so I didn't touch it. I will try the shrimp fried rice next time as I have heard it is good."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Called order they tell me menu prices are wrong online .. so fix it Chang"}
{"text":"Ever since my favorite Chinese restaurant closed in Scottsdale, I have been searching for egg foo yong as I know it. I hate it when the just pile a bunch of meat and vegetables in sauce on top of a (pre-made) egg patty with that is hard. According to me the patty should have bean sprouts (lacking in just about every one I've tried), green onion and maybe some other veggies (not peas and carrots) and the protein you prefer, then covered in a nice meaty gravy. Tam's version had all these things with an interesting addition of a little broccoli in the patty. The gravy was flavorful, too. Also the pork fried rice was fresh and had good flavor. And the price was very reasonable for a combo. It was a good delivery from DoorDash."}
{"text":"This place is good... should try there chicken wings... it's to die for!! The wings are big and has a lot of flavors... it's yummy lol"}
{"text":"i had a craving for some tasty Chinese food but didn't want to drive too far from home.  i got on yelp, read the reviews and i was sold on the chicken wings.  i called ahead, placed my order for the garlic wings and egg rolls.  make sure to take cash, no cards accepted! as soon as my order was ready i got in the car and immediately the aroma from those wings filled the space.  

these are the best wings i have ever had!!!  crunchy, full of flavor, and really big pieces.  the brown bags keep the wings nice and hot, and keep the scent. really inexpensive-4 wings and 2 egg rolls for $7... definitely a little hidden hole in the wall in phoenix!"}
{"text":"A coworker suggested this place for delivery - I'll never order from here again!

The egg rolls are disgusting, the one peice of crab rangoon I received was burnt!
My cashew chicken with fried rice was so disappointing, as the fried rice was burnt with little brown eggs and smelled horrible (could've been the over usage of bean sprouts in the fried rice).  
The sweet & sour chicken could have been so great - but the breading was soggy and the chicken was so dry & chewy...
Not to mention they forgot the drinks I paid for..."}
{"text":"Great food for a decent price! Their garlic chicken wings are superb. I will definitely say it's a hole in the wall. Nevertheless, I'll  sacrifice ambiance and great service for yummy Chinese. It's hard finding decent Chinese food in Phoenix. This here is one of them!"}
{"text":"The wings are outstanding. I can't even put into words how much I love their wings, and I'm picky when it comes to fried chicken. The sweet and sour wings are by far my favorite, followed by the jalape√±o wings.

The actual Chinese food I will never eat again. The chicken fried rice was mushy and not good at all. The orange chicken was just nasty.

But the wings? Yesssss!!!"}
{"text":"Good ol' hood chicken. Had jalape√±o chicken wings and BBQ wings. Best wings I had. Will definitely be coming back for the wings.  Only thing was service was slow."}
{"text":"Most of the food is a little better than ok, fried rice and egg rolls are a little less than ok, chicken wings are good, customer service is something they never heard of, calling in an order is pointless, over charges for debit"}
{"text":"Just found this little gem today and boy am I glad I did.  I've barely noticed the building during my many trips past this place.  You order your food outside through a a tiny window and there is no seating, so take out only, and they only take cash.  Let me tell you, it is worth it! 

I ordered the Pepper Steak lunch special.  The pepper steak has tender beef, green peppers, carrots, onions and peppercorns with a delightful sauce.  You get a large portion of the entree, a mound of fried rice, a yummy egg roll and a fried wonton.  You get all of this for just under $5.00 and it was ready in under 15 minutes.   Big win!

This place is so close to my work and has been there for long time.  I'm only sad I didn't find it sooner!   You can find their menu online if you search \"tam's chinese food phoenix\".  Definitely a hit in our office!  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I never crave Chinese food. It just isn't something I think about. 
But I love this place. I've never had bad food from here. I've had it probably 20 times. And I do crave this place. 
Yeah, they're a bit rude over the phone. And you can't eat in or get it delivered. So, you have to pick it up, and wait outside until your food is done. 
1 times out of the 20, they messed up my order. 
I got another friend that comes to my house so we can order from here. Everyone I know that has eaten their food, loves it. 
Huge portions. 1 meal is usually 3 meals for me."}
{"text":"This place is amazing the jalapeno chicken wings are just the best. The pork fried rice here is super good, you better call ahead cause the wait is not the best and make sure you tell them you ordered on the phone cause they will take it as a new order. The staff is friendly I never had a problem with them. The place is super sketchy and in the southside but hands down it is worth it."}
{"text":"Found out about this place via Yelp after growing tired of the usual China Chili & PeiWei. I was craving some good ole ghetto chinese food like the kind I'm used to growing up in Chicago and this place was just what I needed, I ordered 8 jalapeno wings, pork fried rice and an eggroll - it was greasy, the guy at the register was rude & a couple of neighborhood questionables showed up while I was there but man was it worth it, this definately hit the spot.

They have descent lunch specials and my total came to $9 and some change for all that I listed above, I'll be back.

They accept CC but there's a .75 service charge - not sure if many know it's illegal for businesses to add service charges for card use but it is...considering the neighborhood I would be a little leery carrying cash in the area at night if you're not from those parts."}
{"text":"The wait is long but worth every minute. Once you bite into that greasy bag of jalape√±o wings there is an explosion of juiciness and heat. It's wonderful. Very friendly."}
{"text":"This is a secret!  Worn out sign on the road, almost missed it. Obviously a neighborhood favorite, always 3 or 4 people in line. You order at the slightly grungy window and get handed a piece of cardboard with your order number scribbled on it.  The cardboard number square had evidence of many uses. Our food was ready within about 15 minutes.  Fresh and delicious. Beef fried rice tasty. The jalape√±os wings a must.  Shrimp ramen was pretty good too.  I can't wait to go back and try some other dishes!"}
{"text":"Order ahead. And it'll be ready at the window 15-20 min. Otherwise you will definitely wait. Benefit is that it's blazing Hott and fresh so worth it either way"}
{"text":"I happen to be in a crappy area of Phx and used Yelp to find a good restaurant nearby. This one came up. The place is a dive, no doubt about it - all it consists of is a barred window in the side of a building. Damn if that house fried rice did not taste JUST like the Chinese food take out restaurants in Brooklyn. 

I still have more food to try, but I will be happy to work my way thru the menu over time. 

The second time I went, there were a bunch of cars parked in the lot waiting on food."}
{"text":"Best fried chicken wings I've ever had! Their fried rice was good, but I keep going back for the jalape√±o chicken wings. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Now I wanted some chicken yesterday and found this place on Yelp!  My girlfriend and I ventured out to find this hidden \"hole in the wall\" and after passing it, we realized what people really mean.  Quite literary a hole in the wall.

So we take a look out our car windows to find barred windows, doors, and a solid concrete building. (I was wondering if they actually lived in the back of the place) I saw two people standing in line to order in this small window and saw a small chinese lady yell at the top of her lungs \"Order 22!\" \"Order 22!\" \"2 Egg Rolls!\" 

So instead of getting two orders for ourselves, we decide to get a combo which is priced higher and not to waste any money if we didn't like the food.  I decided on Cashew Chicken and an order of 6 Crab Puffs. Total = $11.86.  Cheap, not too bad.

After receiving our food, we started to head back to our place since there was no seating there nor would you want to sit there outside in the dark.

After opening the containers I will say that you get a lot of food for the price, but you also get a lot of oil and grease as well.  The food had no flavor, the cashews were old, and I wasn't quite sure if the chicken was really chicken.  On a good note, the chicken fried rice and crab puffs were really good.  

After a few bites both my girlfriend and I decided it wasn't all that it was cracked up to be. On top of that, it felt I had a grease lining in my mouth and down my throat. Additionally we smelled of the fine Chinese food that we ordered.

Needless to say we threw out the food and went back out to scrounge up something a little more tasty.

*Best to find another place for chicken without the side order of grease."}
{"text":"From he outside you'd probably be like omg but they have never failed a health inspection ever. The food is fresh, its so good I live in North Phoenix and if I'm wanting Chinese food I will drive forty mind to go get it! My favorite hands down."}
{"text":"i highly recommend the jalapeno wings !!!!! 

call in your order if your pressed for time."}
{"text":"I am not going to lie, if I went based on the look of the building or the nonchalant attitude of the staff I would have never tasted their food. But my goodness the fried chicken wings and the house fried rice was very tasty. It is a go to."}
{"text":"OMG! I cannot believe there are not more reviews for Tam's! This little hole in the wall (and by hole in the wall I mean literally) provides the best blackenese chinese soul food I have ever tasted! As black folk, it is not common for us to say we don't like fried chicken, but I was losing my taste for it! I have to say Tam's restored my love for chicken! 

It's the most flavorlicious chicken you will ever taste! They also have the best fried rice, chow mein noodles, egg foo young w/chicken gravy! I don't think there is anything bad on their menu! Now......

I will say that the location is not desirable, but like a crack head will do anything for a hit,  I will go where ever I have to for Tam's chicken and chinese food! I love it! I drive all the way from North Scottsdale when I need a fix! LOL! My family out town loves it too! Sometimes I get calls from family asking if I can ship some chicken to them all the way to Texas! 

Just remember they cook to order so make sure you call ahead to place your order. But if you are just 15 mins later than the time your order is ready be prepared to wait because your order has been served to someone else! They don't play! If they say it will be ready in 10 mins, be there in 10 mins!"}
{"text":"Just move in the area and was looking for a good Chinese place that was close by. I was kinda of scared to try's this place. it was love at first bite. Had the #8 it's literally can feed 4 people . My fianc√© had the chicken wings and he was in love with them. I can't wait for the rest of my family to try this place."}
