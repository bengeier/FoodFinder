{"text":"For fast food pizza Sbarros in Superstition Springs mall is by far the best. They have an amazing mushroom pizza and Simon behind the counter always has a smile on his face! I come here about once a week and have never been disappointed. This place is great!"}
{"text":"Ugh!  Someone at Sbarro should've apologized to me for selling me this awful lunch!  I ordered the \"special\" Chicken Parm meal. Price not advertised.  Ended up spending $12.50 for wort pasta ever with barely edible chicken, garlic bread stick and small 7Up.  I didn't even eat 1/4 of it.  Terrible!"}
{"text":"Pizza was just some thing awful...$12 for a slice, a bland side and a soda... no thanks just go to ballys and get dollar chicken tacos."}
{"text":"5.20 for 1 slice of pizza is overpriced to begin with. It doesn't help that it was so overseasoned It tasted like I was eating pure onions in oil and nothing else."}
{"text":"For a Saturday evening, the service at Sbarro was pretty quick. The server took my order and heated up my pepperoni and cheese stromboli right away, as she scooped my salad and filled my drink.  There was a pretty good selection of pizzas, stuffed pizzas and 2 other kinds of stromboli.   The pepperoni and cheese stromboli is amazing. It was a good pepperoni to cheese to bread ratio, and it was not too salty.  We went back to try the broccoli, chicken and cheese stromboli but that was nothing like the pepperoni and cheese. Don't even bother."}
{"text":"This place is a no frills fast food place where you pick your food at the counter, put it on a tray, and pay at the register. There is seating available. When I came up to the counter, the server ignored me for about 2 minutes until I asked for help. I was given a slightly warm overcooked piece of breakfast pizza with scrambled eggs, sausage, and cheese. It was very dry. I ate part of it, and threw the rest away. Stay away from the breakfast pizza."}
{"text":"small slices, I have been to sbarro all over the place, but this by far was yuckkkkkkk.   I asked where the cheese and pep slices were and the guy said hidden.  Before I could even reply he said i keep the pricy stuff out for show.  I told him good business but im not there for the stuffed pizza so break out the plain stuff and lets roll.   The small slices were warm at best and didn't have much taste, but after 5 hours at a car show with no food or drink this will do."}
{"text":"I was in here last week during a layover. Obviously it's not amazing, but it's not bad either! Service at the counter was friendly and I didn't get sick from my slice of pepperoni. The crust wasn't like a cracker either. I read the other reviews before giving them my $5, and you know what? Charlotte airport Sbarro is cool with me."}
{"text":"Bad customer service especially the cashier. She is so RUDE to the customers.  date: June 27, 2017 1pm"}
{"text":"What a mistake to come here. Not even a slice of pizza tasted good. It was like rubber and pricey, at that. I s/h have used Yelp to guide me. They took advantage of a tired traveler. Never eat here again."}
{"text":"The woman managing the morning shift when I stopped by on Dec. 17 earned this 1 star, not any of the other employees who were far more competent and polite than she was. I was forced to leave without patronizing this establishment due to the utter ignorance and rudeness of this profoundly nasty woman.  I do believe the side items that were on the menu but were not prepared would have been so if the restaurant did not suffer from such poor management. I don't mind being refused a simple substitution on a buffet line of all things( where you have ample amounts of each item) but I cannot stomach a person on a power trip who is unqualified for their position. I left this place and went to Villa where I was treated with respect."}
{"text":"If you want to wait more than an hour for just a slice of basic pepperoni pizza, definitely go here. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"I work in the mall and didn't have my debit card one day, so the general manager (I think) gave me a bowl of ziti and told me to pay it when I had a chance. A few weeks later I came by again to pay for the bowl of ziti and I saw a card being ran (not mine) and the guy who gave me the bowl of ziti whispering to the cashier and I was not charged for the ziti and only for the pizza judging off of the price. I'm impressed by this establishment and they have definitely made it on my list of places to go at the mall. Thank you again!"}
{"text":"Employees are not happy at all. They are very stubborn and do not accommodate for any allergies. I don't think they like their job very much"}
{"text":"I've been here like 3 times since it opened and have not been impressed on any visit. once you select a slice they make it sound like you have to get a combo because \"the side and drink are free\"... If I say I ONLY want a slice don't make it sound like a combo is my only option then talk up the \"free\" sides and charge $10.50 once I get to the till... I feel like their workers are forced by management to upsell to customers their expensive combos. I could've gotten chipotle across the street for less and I consider that a treat as far as fast food goes in between classes (I'm a Ryerson student). the food is cold and bland and overpriced, you're far better off getting pizza anywhere else close by.   I've had sbarros in Wisconsin and Chicago first (which is the only reason why I tried this location) and it was cheaper and better quality. you should leave Canada if you aren't going to honour the standard set by American franchisees."}
{"text":"This one is located in the Orleans Hotel/Casino. Whoa.  Seen all the negative reviews on here, but I must say that I was pleasantly surprised last night.  Came back to the hotel after a long day out and just wanted a quick snack to take up to my room.  Spotted the spinach and mushroom pizza and asked for a slice.  The friendly worker promptly heated it up which made the crust delightfully crispy and did it all with a smile on her face. Maybe I was lucky? (Not at the slots, though). :("}
{"text":"I was in the Charlotte airport between flights and stopped at Sbarro by gate C14.  Just to echo what the others said, don't expect anything great here.  I got an edible slice of pizza with a crunchy, cracker-like crust.  I suppose it was their version of a thin crust. I had a salad with it for about 8 bucks.   The salad was coated in oil and vinegar dressing.    The pasta dishes did not look good, the marinara sauce looked thin.    Wasn't much different than most Sbarro airport fare."}
{"text":"Had a slice of pepperoni, they put it in the oven got it nice and hot and crispy. Paid under $5 which isn't terrible. Pizza was actually pretty good. Not gonna rave about the flavors but it didn't taste as bad as some other yelpers said. Overall I was satisfied and I will be back."}
{"text":"The service here at this specific sbarro was surprisingly horrendous. I normally come to this sbarro just because of how close it is to my house, but on this visit it definitely did not live up to the other excellent sbarro visits that I've come to know. I had just come from watching a movie, and was looking for a something to eat. Out of all the 4 others places I could've chosen to eat I chose the sbarro. I was with my 3 friends one of which was a little intoxicated at time. As a good friend I tried to get some food in him to try and get him feeling a little better. As I went to the counter to order I was greeted by an associate who showed me great customer service and understood the situation I was in with my friend. As I was ordering a pepperoni pizza and water for my friend she began to tell me that there was a combo I could get instead of the one slice and drink I intended to get that would save me money and get me an extra slice for a few cents more. As I picked my slice and awaited to pay for it and the other slice plus the drink. I was told by Deja the supervisor on duty at midnight on 11/10/15 that my friend who was intoxicated had paid. I'm in shock how could a supervisor of all people in the establishment sell to an intoxicated person whose friend had just told the previous associate that he was going to cover the charges? It makes no sense especially since this is in a casino of all places, so you'd think as a supervisor she would have a little more experience with this. So as I picked up the second slice of pizza I was told that he had not paid for my slice. I was now confused at the situation because I told them to get the combo instead they charged him for the single slice plus drink which came up to $9.06 instead of w/the extra which would've been $1.19 more. I was dumbfounded at the sheer lack of communication at this sbarro, in an area of no more then 5 feet and some how a message is lost? The place wasn't even packed or busy. We were the only customers. I'm not sure if the supervisor was taking advantage of me or my friend by trying to charge us an additional 4 bucks for an order we could've gotten as a combo, but I do know how she handled the situation was not professional. She would not let me pay the difference, but instead threw the slice that I had ordered in the trash! I do not know how she became a supervisor with such a lack of customer service skills, but I can say this I will never come back to this sbarro AGAIN! It has left a bad taste in my mouth for future sbarro visits elsewhere. I'm here left thinking will I be treated the same at other locations?"}
{"text":"Horrid. Cold pizza. Filthy walls, floors tables. The worst ever. The company should be ashamed of this location. It needs to be closed."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Indifferent towards customers and attitude of workers can be improve. This place can do a much better job with the customers that they have."}
{"text":"I love the Sausage & Pepperoni Stromboli's. Being located inside The Orleans, the food is always fresh. Since the restaurant sits across from the sports bar, I enjoy watching whatever live sports happens to be on at the time. Certainly worth a look. I'll be back."}
{"text":"This was my first experience with Sbarro. Will not go again. I ordered two pepperoni slices. They were not hot whatsoever when I received them. There was no sauce on it and barely any cheese. It was basically just dough with pepperonis on it. The check out lady was not friendly, did not ask me how I wanted to pay - she assumed it was debit and walked away to do something else. I waited for her to come back to tell her it was cash and she was visibly annoyed. Terrible experience."}
{"text":"If you like to eat cardboard instead of pizza, eat there.  No customer service, they messing up the orders, overcharging your bill. At least, they are well trained at fooling the customers. Do not go in weekends."}
{"text":"I usually come here because the bf enjoys Sbarro. I've definitely had better pizza elsewhere and Sbarro is just way overpriced. Especially at this location."}
{"text":"I stopped by the McCarran Airport Sbarro in Vegas yesterday for a bite during my layover.  The girl behind the food line was so rude and impatient when I asked questions about the entree menu, like she couldn't be bothered.  $15 for a plate of lousy spaghetti with meatballs and a side of veggies, but that would have been tolerable if she had been pleasant.  She was just as rude to the woman next in line.  And here is the height of wishful thinking on their part: after the lousy service, there was a tip jar sitting out there at the check-out register, as if I would give them one red cent for their horrible attitudes.  Sbarro should make a policy that workers should not yak with each other in Tagalog when others present don't speak the language - it' just plain RUDE."}
{"text":"I was craving some pizza here in CLT, so I thought why the heck not it will satisfy the craving. The piece of pie I got was nasty the crust was almost like chewing on a piece of cardboard  and just generally an unpleasant experience. The pizza for being a supreme had a flavor of nothing but fat and and salt, nothing else really."}
{"text":"Overpriced and not good. Had a pizza craving and ordered a pizza slice from here. The bottom crust was soft (soggy) and the slice couldn't hold it's shape or toppings; the whole thing fell apart before I could even take my first bite. It was stressful trying to eat it and tasted extremely disappointing, definitely did not do anything for my pizza craving. After googling other pizza joints, I realized pizza pizza was only 5 mins down the block from dundas so went there to get my pizza fix instead"}
{"text":"Had a layover and wanted to get something to eat. The pizza was just okay but the restaurant itself was awful. The employees were unfriendly and if you didn't know right away what you wanted they would just walk away. The place was a mess! The tables were dirty, the trash was overflowing, and the floors were disgusting. They need to retrain their employees on customer service and how to clean. Ick."}
{"text":"Very horrible customer service?food was not bad, very pricey for just one slice of pizza. Would not recommend to eat there, they do not appreciate your business. Servers constantly on their phone instead focus on the me. Also have to go through a lot of trouble for just want get a free refill on my drink that I spend almost $3 on."}
{"text":"Arrogant staff! Cold eggs... Over charged for a breakfast platter 13 dollars for two sausages and a cold egg!"}
{"text":"I generally avoid fast food and chains, but late night circumstances dictated.  The Hawaiian slice I ordered was not great.  I couldn't tell whether it's not great all time or whether it had been sitting for too long (it was 3:30 or so in the morning when I got it).  The crust tasted pretty dried out as did the rest of it."}
{"text":"Slow to clean the dirty tables..... Got a slice that was not the greatest. Stromboli looked good."}
{"text":"The most mediocre pizza place in the most mediocre food court in the most mediocre hotel in Las Vegas.   Before heading to Sbarro, which is located in a basement food court of Bally's Hotel, ask yourself? Am I hungover? Do I need this food so I don't die? Unless you have answered yes to either of these questions, do not proceed to eat at Sbarro.  There's a reason these places are only in food courts. Because nobody with transportation (car, bike, train, jet pack) would actually stop here. And there's a reason they have gone bankrupt twice - the food is bland and overpriced.  Seriously, two slices of pizza for like $10 and a Gatorade for $3.50? I can get two pizzas and two gallons of Gatorade from Little Caesars for that much.  Pass on the Sbarro and pass on this entire food court. It is not worth your time."}
{"text":"Loved mine. The garlic bread was only ok. The stuffed pizza was delicious. I've always loved Sbarro's. I recommend the peperoni or pep and sausage slice. The stuffed pep and sausage pizza and the ziti. I love their ziti."}
{"text":"I love pizza but this reheated cardboard grease wheel that I just ate here was pretty nasty. The people working here are very nice though."}
{"text":"Pepperoni pizza was fuckin' bomb!  Quick service, and in the food court inside Monte Carlo."}
{"text":"Lots of portions and tastes like any other sbarro. staff wasnt too friendly but they were really busy so I dont blame them. The food is simple, but filling. mmm. Im going to eat my leftovers now. =)"}
{"text":"Sometimes thankfully not very often the travel schedule gets skewed and there's absolutely no time to eat between flights and the choices near the gate isn't exactly what you had hoped them to be. This is when you're caught between a Sbarro and a Burger King and on this particular day I really didn't have it my way so after contemplating just doing without I realized I was flying Southwest and they have nothing but a carbo snack basket and if I grabbed a slice of pizza worst case I could just eat the toppings so I did, yes it was horrible pizza but the service was very good and they did have a fresh right out of the oven pizza being sliced up when I joined the short line. I was also fortunate enough to find a small dirty table next the the exit only a short walk from my gate. I don't think it's something I'd do again...."}
{"text":"This is the worst location I have been to. The employees are rude! I asked for meatballs with sauce and received meatballs with no sauce. I asked again for sauce and the girl wandered away so I asked another employee who seemed clueless so I asked for a refund. The pizza is disgusting old and stale. The location to go to is the one in Ballys I eat there often. Skip this joint the worst!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is actually pretty good the sauce could use some flavor and they could try to put more cheese on the pizza as I got to the last bite there was hardly any cheese on that part of my pizza and it was all sauce other then that whenever I get another chance I plan on eating the pizza here again."}
{"text":"I still crack up every time I picture Steve Carell raving about this authentic Italian chain. Stopped by for a snack, and was sad to find that not only was the pizza poor -- I'd actually say Sam's Club has better pizza -- but they couldn't even serve it hot. That, plus being seriously overpriced means I've gotten my nostalgia fix, I completely understand why they went bankrupt, and I won't waste my time with them again."}
{"text":"i can not believe that your sbarro food line workers do not wear cloves! she just touched my food! and the next guy's food! he just dipped the parm cheese to go cup in the whole 6 pan of cheese when there was a perfectly good portion spoon in there!"}
{"text":"Complete garbage.    25.00 for two stromboli's and horrible sides.     Stromboli's 90 % bread and a mixture of horrible pepperoni and cheese.   The meal includes a side and drink. The sides include either a salad, pasta or bread sticks.  All equally horrible......  Pasta is plain. Basically boiled noodles that can be bought for. 25 cents.   Breadsticks taste processed obviously made with horrible ingredients.  I work too hard to burn money on garbage like this. I'm surprised this is still open.  Consider a Subway, Chipotle, etc.  P.S.   Ask for a fork or you will end up eating plain pasta with your hands."}
{"text":"I just landed and I was looking for something to eat. One guy behind the counter was like who wants this slice? And so I took it. I can't remember what was on it but it was pretty good. I couldn't stay long i had to catch a flight to Tampa. People in Charlotte have funny accents."}
{"text":"I'm a little disappointed. My pizza didn't hardly have any sauce on it. I assumed it was very fresh bc it's early in the day 12:22. I was so hungry that I just went on and ate it since it was paid for. I enjoyed my view sitting, looking out the window and it was cool in here. I probably wouldn't eat at this one again."}
{"text":"***This Sbarro's pizza-by-the-slice was bad (even by Las Vegas fast food standards)***  I love getting pizza by the slice, but this was awful.  Pizza was just bad; it had really been sitting around for a long time (and it was kinda cold).  Las Vegas food is overpriced so if you are looking for something cheap and quick, this may be an option (at least, it won't make you sick...probably)."}
{"text":"Pepperoni, sausage, ham, and bacon pizza hit the spot after a 20 oz of Stella Artois over at Tequileria. Nice crispy crust with a crunch, large slices... Nothing to really complain about!  ... Except the lack of tables to sit at. Some random middle-aged guy just joined me at the table and offered me fries from Burger King."}
{"text":"I wish I had checked the reviews on this place before stopping here for a quick lunch. I get that it's food court food, but it's not cheap either and for the price I paid I expect better service. The workers seemed disinterested and entirely unhelpful. The pasta was overcooked and lacked any real flavor - I could've cooked better pasta myself! Would not recommend this place to anyone. You're better off eating at Pizza Pizza just down on Yonge St."}
{"text":"This place was okay for a quick late night bite.  We had the tomato/spinach pizza and a slice of the pepperoni pizza.  The pepperoni was spicy but good. The slices were generous and well priced.  Maybe it was our good luck, but the service was fast and the employees were attentive, even though it was really close to closing time. We'd surely stop by again.  This seemed to be one of the eateries in the food court that stayed open a little later.  I'd recommend Sbarro at The Orleans and probably will stop by again when we are there.  :-)"}
{"text":"Sbarro in the Orleans food court. Stopped by for a quick dinner before catching a movie. Line moved fast...quicker than the one at Fuddruckers and Subway.  Stromboli combo (includes drink and one side) $11.99 Fountain drinks: Pepsi products, Dr Pepper, fruit punch"}
{"text":"The line here moved terribly slow due to indifferent employees. We have flights to catch, people! They offered to warm up some peoples pizza slices but not others. I'm not sure what the qualifier was.   Sbarro pizza is generally predictable. What can you really expect from a food court? I do enjoy the large slices, though that's what I expect when they charge you the price of half a large pizza.   I would have liked more time to explore some different food options. I'd recommend you do the same."}
{"text":"(1/13/2017)  Was trapped on my concourse with a limited amount of time and Sbarro was the only hot food nearby.  Ordering was quick, waiting for the Pepperoni Stromboli to warm in the oven was not.  I would've been fine with waiting a little longer for the middle of my stromboli to move above room temp, but the line was getting backed up pretty badly (didn't help that airport staff dude was trying to talk up Sbarro spaghetti lady).  Overall, pretty much what you expect from concession stand pizza, salty, rather greasy, and from an airport concession, overpriced."}
{"text":"Pretty decent pizza, especially for a mall.  I never get the slices that are sitting out though, so I can't comment on those.  I usually order the whole pie, it's a lot cheaper than buying a slice or two separately for everyone.  Also their Stromboli are really good as well.  It's not the best pizza you'll ever eat, but I can think of dozens of worse places in the area."}
{"text":"Sbarro, LLC is a well-known pizzeria chain. They are specialized in the pizza style that is famous all over the New York. This pizza is fascinating added with the touch of slice and other Italian-American cuisine.   They are best with their pasta and salad story too. They have the excellent quality of the food with the delicious taste of spices all over it.   They have the friendly touch in their environment arrangement for the servings."}
{"text":"Best thing about the place is the prices. Food is bland and mediocre but at least you can see what you're getting and it's hard to mess up pizza and pasta.  Stay away from the meatballs - they taste like they're made from cat food.  In the Ballys food court - good for lunch or grabbing quick meal.  If you can walk over to Paris Paris there are several more options that have inexpensive selections."}
{"text":"Decent pizza for a mall food court. Portion is large, sauce isn't bad, crust isn't too hard, and I didn't run into the service issues other people mention. But the cheese had a flat one-note taste to it that didn't even seem like a blend, and the (canned) mushrooms were slimy. It's about what you expect- average."}
{"text":"Man are you guys deceiving!!! I had a slice of your supreme pizza, and there was hardly any cheese on it. It had so soooooo little masqueraded by toppings, charge people more for less, ripping off the public.  The one in sunset station hopefully is better!!!"}
{"text":"Yuckk! Arrogant annoying staff. Worlds most pathetic pasta and sides of potatoes. Trust me the best part about my meal was the Pepsi. It was so yuckkk. Save money eat a Subway right next to it.  The arrogant manager pushed on us a meal for 12 bucks when we were buying just a baked pasta for $9. I think he did it to empty his months old food from getting reheated and sold for the coming next couple of months."}
{"text":"Pizza's not the greatest but Sbarro is one of the few eateries located in Monte Carlo that's open 24/7 which is very convenient if you flew in late and rather go straight to the hotel instead of driving around or walking the distance just to look for a place to eat. It does appear that they continuously make fresh batches of pizza, which is definitely a plus. We did try the mushroom pizza with whole gloves of garlic and pepperoni with bacon pizza which in my opinion, were not bad at all. If you're not in the mood for pizza, there are other food items available such as pasta and cheese bread."}
{"text":"The first time I made a stop in Charlotte I went to this very place. I did the same the two times after that (even when my flight didn't land close to the C concourse)  Since my first visit, every time I have competing flights while going to the East Coast, the one that stops in Charlotte makes the last cut.  The reason: very good pizza."}
{"text":"I wanted to let you know we just ate at the Galleria Mall in Henderson and the gentleman who served us, Tim, the general manager, really did great with taking good care of us! He was very apologetic for the other store and he was very friendly.  I even tried to tip him but he refused. The food was yummy! Thank you."}
{"text":"The fountain coke was under carbonated and too syrupy and the 3 slices of pizza were 18$ not to mention odd tasting and greasy."}
{"text":"Typical Sbaro menu. Unfortunately this  franchise is very dirty. I work in the airport. So I  see  it regularly not like the passengers who just pass through.They do a booming business due to the airline passengers but when I look around the dining area I think could use a power washing and a few gallons of bleach.  Just think of what we cant see. Where is the health department? Hey manager! The  food is good but clean the dining room. Please!"}
{"text":"My favorite things at Sbarros is the stromboli with extra sauce.  It's not that flavorful but I think it offers the best value and makes me really full.  The prices here are ridiculous compared to mall prices.  $6.99 for a stromboli, really guys?!?  I guess its just that this one was located in the Charlotte Airport so the rent is higher than usual."}
{"text":"This is my go to place when I work and get out late. It is walking distance from my work and I grew up on Sbarro and all the Sbarro locations I have been to have tasted great. This is my favorite Sbarro because it is in a nice food court in Bally's casino and it is open 24 hours. If you have not been to this Sbarro it is highly recommended that you try it out. Pizza is great and so is the stromboli, lasagna and spaghetti. I am so glad that I found this place. If you are ever in Vegas this is your best choice for affordable pizza that tastes great. I also love that this Sbarro still has the old classic Sbarro logo."}
{"text":"Dreadful food ( have not tried their pizza). The lemon chicken and the Greek salad were tolerable, but the spaghetti and sauce, plus the chicken parmigiana, we're tasteless. I would suggest, if you want Italian, go to a real Italian eatery ( Uncle Sals comes to mind)! This is warmed over food at its worst. Spaghetti on ice heated by immersing in hot water is unacceptable. Food should be fresh at the very least."}
{"text":"Order nothing from this place. Probably the worst pizza i've had. High school cafeteria food at best...but it's actually worse. Didn't help that the people working were complaining about wanting to go home."}
{"text":"Ehh this pizza is gross greasy and tasteless. Worse than school cafeteria pizza. It also is not very cheap for a ehh piece of pizza. My little cousin did not even eat her slice she just bit it. I would definitely go to the other food in the hotel's food court. Very bland. To top it off my pizza was kind of cold even though they had just popped it in the oven."}
{"text":"I wish i could give negative stars, this Sbarros has really declined the GM is never to be seen  the employees have no clue ,they seem to do what they want, the only time they are friendly an have fresh pizza ,pasta, an breadsticks out is when the district manager is coming or they are having a managers meeting, you ask for a side of sauce for the breadsticks they catch an attitude ,i would not recommend this sbarros to anyone but since they are in a  casino they no the tourists will always come, so they can care less about local customers, hand washing procedures are out the door you can not handle money then handle food at this sbarros its all the time stay away, bad attitudes an lazy ass management, and food poisoning await you i Gaurentee it"}
{"text":"I am crazy about this pizza that I buy by the slice. Always hot & yummy cheese with peparoni. I like to get it for lunch after I'm done at the spa. Ok so I happen to swing back by after my first slice and get a second slice. I love to add cheese and hot pepper flakes woot woot woot that's a nice snack den baby! Got to hook myself up with a large Pepsi with extra ice. Five stars is what I give this place."}
{"text":"Iate here on my birthday this year since I was staying at the Orleans. My friends and I bought a deluxe pizza which came out to about $18..... The pizza was great, just a bit pricey but I figured it would be since it's in a casino. It loses a star for price, but it's 24 hours and good food."}
{"text":"Strombolis only 6.99 + a pair of brand new pants. Strongly suggest people do not get the Stromboli here. When she lifted it up to wrap it up for me, it was sitting in 1/3\" of grease & unsure what else liquid. The Stromboli is completely soggy & dripped onto my brand new, first time worn pants. So much for trying to dress nice for my flight."}
{"text":"Is there a Food Court in America that doesn't have a Sbarro's?    I remember when we first stumbled upon Sbarro's on Lexington Avenue and 58th Street, oh so many years ago. I believed this was the family's first store in Manhattan.  The food now, as it was then is somewhat respectable east coast Italian pizza.  Don't get me wrong, it's nothing special.  The pasta has been pre-cooked and is just sitting there waiting for it's final watery bath before being served to you.  I have never been a fan of this eeck.   But the pizza is not bad for what it is, somewhat above the freezer case variety."}
{"text":"Servers are not friendly,  pizza was cold and not fresh, salad was not fresh.  cashiers also not friendly.  the area to get your drinks , forks and napkins was dirty."}
{"text":"We were just 'up' for Sbarros tonight, so I ran out to the Mall just to get 2 pizzas......once again, the 2 ladies working were super nice and the pizzas were grrrrrreat......place looked SUPER clean......every customer I saw was happy.......this really is a nice place."}
{"text":"Located in the food court at Bally's near the monorail. Decent pizza for a decent price if you need something late when everything else is closed and are staying at Bally's or the Paris. I recommend this place over the pizza place located in the Paris."}
{"text":"Well, 5 people for 70 bucks is kind of devastating, but I suppose it was opkay....it sucked that there was a mix of communication and the cashier didn;t seem too pleasant or understanding of us, but int he end we got our food, tatse like Houston's, but somehow just a lot more pricey....exceptional. Reminds you of Houston's mall food court."}
{"text":"Food was great aswell customer service. And really enjoyed black female managers assistance and personality to me and my family. Would come back 10 more times just for the great customer service."}
{"text":"We take lunch at 10 - 10:30 at work and once in a while go to sbarros at the Orleans, usually their selection includes 3-4 pizzas and some stromboli and eggs, bacon and potatoes.  This last time will be my last time going.  2 pizza selections, Really!  Help was not very helpful.  Usually the food is just almost ok, but this time is my last time."}
{"text":"Not sure if this page is for the Sbarro at the airport...this is the only one that showed up. Anyways, I'm not big on employee interaction, but the people here at this location have got to be the rudest people ever.  Not only did the server seem like she was miserable and hated her job and totally ignored the customers trying to place an order in line as she's daydreaming, but the cashier was equally as rude. Maybe they're both having a bad day but I totally felt awkward as they gave me dirty looks and acted as if it was a burden to take care of their customers even as I smiled and tried to make the most of this interaction. LOUSY CUSTOMER SERVICE!!"}
{"text":"It's a Sbarro, and just a normal one at that.  Decent pizza with good sized portions.    However, being in a hotel and being in Vegas, it has to have Vegas prices.  Two slices and two bottles of water set me back almost 20 dollars.   If I wasn't jet lagged and so tired I wouldn't have gone here, but I simply came here out of convenience."}
{"text":"Terrible food and they left mine siting on the counter which made it worse."}
{"text":"I work in another restaurant in the Orleans so I frequent this Sbarro while on my short break.  The pizza is hit and miss, sometimes it's really good and fresh, other times not so much. Most of the staff is nice, however the male manager is often rude, no idea about saying thank you, or even a smile."}
{"text":"It's pizza. At Las Vegas airport.  It is what it is.  I came here in the morning and they moved incredibly slow.  I stood in line (by myself) for a good 5-7 minutes til the associate finally decided to come out from the back and help me.  I got a slice of sausage pizza, and they warmed it up.  It was a little on the dry side."}
{"text":"No wonder I couldn't find this place on Yelp. OK I don't usually take the time to review places, but this place definitely warranted it.    WHAT the hell did I eat? A slice of pizza?  Seriously?  You are a huge franchise operation and this doughy tomatoe paste slab of crap is what you proudly serve?  I spent 7 hours on my feet walking the convention floor...we had two choices for food... Sbarro or Nathans Hot dogs..  we chose Sbarro... I'm a Pizza connoisseur.... yes some people say the water is the cause for bad crust...but this ...this wasn't even crust.... you can see the frozen pre-made, cooked  round \"crust\" stacked on the counter in back... it's really not hard to make a palatable pizza.... good pizza sauce ...oregano,  garlic,  good quality mozzarella cheese.   That's all...  this was the most disgusting slice of pizza I have ever tasted.... I could cook up a better slice on a Betty crocker light bulb oven...at least the cheese would have been melted.    How dare you even label your restaurant \"fresh Italian eatery\"?  I am offended that you even label this Italian food.  Honestly, my Grandfather would have spat this food on the floor at your feet with just a single bite.    Sbarro, you are the poster child of corporate greed.  Charging $8.00 for a slice of faux?   Absolutely no regard to the taste buds of your customers....you should be ashamed of yourselves.    I'm surprised Pepsi doesn't pull out from your stores.   UNLESS YOURE A FAN OF PUBLIC RESTROOMS, HAVE PLENTY OF ASS-GASKETS FOR THE TOILET AND  YOU VALUE THE HEALTH OF YOUR BOWELS, STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS PLACE.  DISGUSTING."}
{"text":"Yeah, this was pretty bad and a waste of as starving to death and loaded up with spaghetti w/ meatballs and a slice of pizza to chase it down. The spaghetti was very soft and the meatballs were maybe 3/4 cooked. The pizza was subpar and had looked like it had been sitting around all day but wasn't, it was straight out of the oven. The meal wasn't cheap either, over $20. I can honestly say I won't be back."}
{"text":"I really love this place and since I'm originally from NY, I know my pizza.   As the other reviewer said, the pizza is consistent and they always have the same friendly staff.  They most delicious option in the food court! Yum!"}
{"text":"The good: - they have pizza  The  bad - used to be clean. - tables, floor, trays are dirty - pricey"}
{"text":"I new this place sucked from the last time I ate here but for some odd reason I was tempted to eat here again well I was right it still sucks I had a hankering for spagetti and meatballs first I will say the sauce was watery and had very little flavor the meat balls tasted like a lot of filler and also had a strange flavor the bread stick was ok ..."}
{"text":"I'm in airports all the time and this is my new favorite stop.  The vegetable side was huge with al  dente carrots, broccoli and squash. (Caution hot pepper flakes).  The lasagna was fresh, hot, and marinara sauce was light and more sweet than acidic.  Clean kitchen and friendly staff.  Blows the other fast food stops away at this airport.  Check out Ethel M chocolates near C4 gate.  Amazing value for such fine chocolates."}
{"text":"Am I in Mexico? I can't tell by the music. WTF? Mexican music at a pizza place. Pizza is not looking good tonight. God forbid you ask them to add pepperoni to a piece of cheese.  Food is C+ so I will be generous with 3 stars"}
{"text":"Did not enjoy my experience here at all. Yes, I understand that it's in a mall food court so technically I shouldn't expect much, but all the other food places in the urban eatery are much better than this.  I went just after 8pm where they advertise buy one slice of pizza, get one free as an end of the day special.  The girl working there almost didn't want to give us the special even though it was clearly after 8pm....kinda confusing. She just had a weird attitude and lacked any customer service skills. Anyways,  she warmed up 2 slices, and both tasted really bad. Dry, no flavour, it was almost hard to get any motivation to eat it....I mean, I think I would've preferred getting a slice if pepperoni pizza from 7-11 for much less!   Even with the bogo free deal, I wouldn't recommend it, definitely not worth the $5."}
{"text":"Obviously Sbaros pizza isnt the best of quality, but its definitely good and a quick option. This Sbaros is in a great location. Right on the strip, right in a hotel. They had atleast 4 different pizzas to choose from, pasta, veggies, and even dessert. I got a slice of mushroom and spinach pizza and a side of veggies. The service was pretty good as well. No complaints!"}
{"text":"Sbarro is always the worst thing ever, but sometimes, when you are in an airport and you need to cram a quick bite down your gullet, you take the hit.  And sometimes when you do that, you will discover that the terrible Sbarro you grew up with at your local mall was in fact a superb and splendid culinary experience compared to what the Las Vegas airport offers by way of Sbarro.    I am 95% sure if you fed this to an elderly person or a small child, both groups with immune system issues, it would kill them."}
{"text":"Decent enough for a mall food court location.  Service was fast, but waiting for the food to be heated took some time.  Speaking of that, why do you need to heat to the point where I take a bite and it burns the roof of my mouth.  That's even when it's been sitting for a few minutes to cool.  Typical pizza fare you can find anywhere from one of their free standing stores, turnpike rest stop, or for that matter, any other pizza stop along the way.    The only downside to this particular location on this particular day was that they were training a new employee, making wait times a little longer than expected for a food court."}
{"text":"We were at the Orleans to catch a movie and decided to grab a bite to eat before going in. You'll find this place in the little mini-food court over near the Poker Room.  (+) the employees were all very friendly and helpful. Certainly no complaints there. (+) the prices were fair when considering that you are still in a casino (+) portions were fair and filling. I especially enjoyed the Baked Ziti very much. The extreme pepperoni stromboli was tasty as well, with a real buttery flavor to it.  (-) while the portions were tasty and filling, the food here is VERY greasy. Very. As in they need wet wipes instead of napkins. Like, a trip to the bathroom is an immediate necessity as soon as you are done eating.  This place was A-Ok. Certainly nothing to go out of your way for, but if you want a quick, (relatively) cheap bite to eat while at the Orleans, it should do the trick. I wavered between 2 and 3 stars, but the employees were nice, so here's to the benefit of the doubt!  3 stars.  A-Ok."}
{"text":"Sbarro is mediocre at best on any given occasion however it turns out its especially bad at airport locations."}
{"text":"TLDR: michael Scott's favorite authentic Italian place in Vegas.   See above. It's late at night. You've been gambling. Walking the strip. Drinking. You need food. You come back to Bally's and wander down to the food court. Homely smells of your moms home cooked hand rolled gnocchi waft towards you. You continue towards the scent and then realize youre not home. You're at Sbarros. As the manager of the regional branch of a struggling mid level paper company you know what authentic Italian is. You've been to Times Square plenty of times to meet with corporate. You're surprised that little hole in the wall would franchise, but nevertheless you're here. Sbarros is here. Happiness is here."}
{"text":"This place takes forever!  We were the first customers of the morning and they decided to make 3 pizzas to put on display before us paying customers.  The manager David is RUDE and very professional. Jr the cook tried to get \"gangster\" and ghetto on us.  All we wanted was pizza and the experience we got was enough never to stay at Ballys ever again!"}
{"text":"Stopped by last night after watching a movie with my siblings. The food here looks good but tastes like tomatoes and salt. We tried their baked ziti, roasted potatoes, spaghetti & meatballs, and their chicken parmagiana; cannot say anything positive about any of them. We kept picking at our food hoping it would magically start tasting better.  The ladies preparing my food were nice. The cashier was not.   I'll probably just go to Subways for a quick bite the next time I watch a movie at the Orleans."}
{"text":"Pizza was fine.  The services were odd.  Woman put two slices of greasy pizza on top if each in a single box, couldn't close it when she tried, handed it to me.  Others were getting separate boxes.  Closed. The cashier said something I didn't hear clearly, repeated it with a tone.  I then realized they are just pushing their hump through the day. Not there for customer service so much.  I detected an attitude. The other workers actually looked fine in action.  Guess I got the two loafs in the team.   Need to groom them with a customer service class."}
{"text":"Food court food, food court service. I'd say it was one of the more reasonably priced in terms of the amount of food you get. Would visit again."}
{"text":"Pretty good. Just a quick stop that we made on our way back to our room for a quick bite. The calzones were really good and full of pepperoni. The garlic dipping sauce was nice as well. Wish I would have bought too. I felt like the cost was correct and not to overpriced."}
{"text":"The kids love the Sbarro's at the Monroeville Mall Food Court. The pizza is always fresh. They also love the rolls. The price is reasonable.  The Mall Food Court can be a nice place in the afternoon when the older kids are in school. It hardly ever crowded."}
{"text":"I usually order a large pizza from Sbarro for my daughter and her friends. The slices are big and they will divide it into more slices if you ask. I like to call ahead  and order so by time I get there in about 10 -15minutes it is ready to go. The pizza is not to thick or burnt on the bottom and taste similar too NY style ( not exact but close). The price for the large pizza is fair.  The staff is always friendly and they offer great customer service. They always put in extra cheese, pepper packets,and napkins (plates when I ask). I recently have  had a hard time calling ahead to place my order.  Answer your phone please Sbarro ! I've had no complaints or issues so far with the pizza. We will be back !"}
{"text":"This used to be a good pizza. I ordered a cheese slice at the airport (Charlotte, NC) and what I got was a piece of cardboard with sauce and cold cheese.  Very disappointed especially for being over priced."}
{"text":"First and foremost I have to point out how rude the employee I dealt with was. Long story short I was beyond starving and didn't feel like any kind of fancy dining so I wound up downstairs in the food court. The meat calzones looked great and for $6 and some change I thought why not? I pointed to what I wanted and the girl working pulled one of these other calzones from under the fresh looking ones, turned around threw it in the oven and dismissed me.. Umm excuse me? So I kindly let her know I would like the fresh looking calzone and she proceeds to tell me that \"they are all the same\" with an attitude .. Visually it didn't look that way and last time I checked im the customer and I'm paying so if I want a specific calzone why argue? Just give me the damn calzone I requested! Thanks (inserts B word)"}
{"text":"When I lived in Los Angeles I lived in the S'Barrio. But let's go back about 5 years before that.  The first meal I ever had on the first night I ever spent in the United States was at Sbarro of Times Square. As a 16 year old, who had run away from home in England (basically), I thought it was the sh**. Of course it wasn't the sh** but that's how it felt at the time.  Since then, Sbarro's will always have a place in my heart. Some of their products are awful and reheated and congealed, but then others actually taste pretty decent. Not too shabby. Depends on the location. This one was pretty good. We got a bit of everything (between 4 of us) and it was a hell of a lot better than the Subway sh** we ate the previous time we were here. The only reason it gets 3 and not 4 is that it's too pricy, and it's a national chain and I don't much like those."}
{"text":"Luis is so rude tho i don't know why he is dealing with his costumer like that. I'm not gonna eat in this please any more just because of him."}
{"text":"Quick shitty pizza found in malls and airports.. though big slices and decent prices."}
{"text":"You can stand at this sbbaro trying to order but the employees care more about having conversations and I saw no gloves and hats on some of them. Do not go"}
{"text":"3* for normalizing to airport standards. 2* if it were outside the airport. Maybe I shouldn't normalize as to force airport restaurants to step up their game..."}
{"text":"Well, I debate because the food was just ok, however the people were really friendly. So I wasn't sure between a 3 and 4. The service brought it up a star.  The food was well, hey fast food Italian. It was good enough for lunch.  They tough sell on the up sells, bigger drink, combo, etc. which I didn't like, but overall not bad."}
{"text":"You're familiar with this pizza if you've patronized any of the typical mall food court pizza um choices.  The staff here is friendly and responsive enough but that doesn't get the place a higher score.  Bland flavor to be had if you decide this is where you must satisfy those pizzeria cravings.    Ultra convenient based on location alone because it's right on the gambling floor and close to the parking garage so you'll pass it coming and going.  If you really have to have pizza, pasta or bread sticks right now, a stop here will tide you over but your taste buds might ask you to treat them better next time.   Carb up!"}
{"text":"Terrible service and food! Five workers and the service was terrible! Not one employee acknowledged us so our party went to the one person at the register and ordered. Haha, joke on us, those four workers that were too busy talking that was who we were to give our order too. Now a previous customer is requesting a refund for dry pasta! Manager, gray with glasses is just having a good time with all the employees. What a huge mess!! Don't bother! Both Fuddrucker's and Sbarro are awful! Do not go to either at the Orleans in Vegas! Terrible!"}
{"text":"The food was really good. Especially the Hawaiian pizza. My boys loved their food too. Really good food for a fast service place in a food court."}
{"text":"Great little place tucked into the food court of the Orleans. The pizza was full of flavor and very filling. I've never seen a Sbarro outside of a food court somewhere and don't even know if they exist, but would love to see what they could do on a grander scale. They have definitely become my food court \"go to.\" Good italian restaurant quality food with food court convenience."}
{"text":"I love pizza as it is but sbaro's is one of the best pizza place I've had the pleasure of eating at . I plan eating here at least once a week because I work in ph . Keep up the good work see you soon"}
{"text":"As far as food court food goes, it is worse than the food available at airports for the same price since it tastes like it's been sitting in the display case for some time. It varies slightly based on which item one buys, although the pasta seems to be the best since it turns over faster.  It's a little hard to figure out what to do there since the staff doesn't explain the prices or how to order and there doesn't seem to be a menu that one can look at so one's on their own when it comes to how much one will spend and what items pair with each other in terms of pricing.  Well, in comparison to all of the other places of the food court there, it's priced better since one gets more quantity."}
{"text":"Usually the pizza at Sbarro sucks. The company is always in corporate trouble. Because the pizza is typically overpriced and not so tasty. The pizza here was surprisingly good. Friendly service. Overpriced for my standards, but reasonably priced for Vegas standards. I would stop by here again next time I'm at Bally's."}
{"text":"Food was barely edible, and Luke warm. Dining area was filthy. Sbarro used to be a good bet for quick, decent food. Chicken parm tasted like nothing, sauce was mostly water, bread tasted like it had been microwaved and left to sit and get hard. Only good thing I can say is that it was carbon based."}
{"text":"This was awhile back but I never got my review written.  My daughter and I were shopping and decided to eat in the Food Court.  I looked around and of everything I saw on that day, the Stromboli here looked the best.  I was NOT disappointed.  The flavor and texture were wonderful.  It was a good portion for the price also so I had leftovers.  I would get it again but haven't yet because other places have opened that I wanted to try.  Someday!  stromboli!"}
{"text":"I was wanting to find the pizza hut express to get one of those mini pizzas to take with me on the plane, but I didn't have the time to go look for it. I only had 50 minutes and I barely got there in time to line up with my section even though this was on the way.   I ordered a slice of supreme even though I wanted pepperoni. The guy in front of me ordered the last three slices for his family. How annoying!   Pros:  -It was relatively quick and the pizza was edible.   Cons:  -Did not have more pepperoni or cheese pizza ready to go, but had plenty of the less popular flavors. -Barely any pizza sauce on my pizza.  -Crust thicker than I'd like it to be for NY style pizza. -Pizza didn't seem as fresh and warm and other chains.  -Expensive- almost $5 a slice.  -Workers aren't that friendly."}
{"text":"I'm seeing some bad reviews for this location, but I had a very good experience when I was there last week. The people were very nice and I got very good service. It's in the food court of The Orleans casino, towards the back. I really like Sbarro's pizza, so I like to stop by when I have the chance. The pizza was a little greasy, but most pizza with cheese and pepperoni is, so it's not a big deal. Again, had very good service."}
{"text":"I love Sbarro's I used to eat. This pizza as a kid at the local mall. Service was great and the pizza was as I remembered it. If you are here and want to grab something quick this is a good place to go too. When fling out of Philly I will be headed back here for my hunger needs."}
{"text":"yah, chain pizza in an airport, what could you expect?  i think i paid $5 for one of the worst slices of pizza i have ever had. and i ate the whole thing."}
{"text":"I had made the choice to watch the Suns at the bar and drink a few beers rather than eat a real dinner.  When the game was over I was hungry but didn't want much.  I have seen Sbarro at several casinos but had never tried them.  At $3.99 a slice they get a high price for average pizza without many choices.  They cook the pizza sorta and then when you order it they toss on the items that don't take long and toss your slice back in the oven for a couple of minutes.  The folks behind the counter were pleasant enough but you feel rushed as they try to keep the line moving."}
{"text":"Everyone smiled and was helpful, pizza was not great but it is what should be expected from a mall pizza place. Price is ok and there is a lot of seating. The plastic ware was really nice! Lol"}
{"text":"I swear the pizza was better before.  =(  It was warm and the cheese was just bearly melting."}
{"text":"If your looking for a quick bite on your way to wherever your going this Sbarro will do.  Slices tend to be a bit smaller than your normal mall Sbarro, but for Vegas, prices are decent.  Service is usually good, and there tends to be a small to non-existent wait."}
{"text":"I think that's the greasiest pizza I have ever had. It was dripping everywhere on us while we were trying to eat it. And $14 for two pieces of pizza and a soda is a little high, although they were big slices. Stood waiting for a few minutes with no other customers before someone helped me. She was very nice though."}
{"text":"There is not so much to say about Sbarro. I use to live it as a kid and now as an adult I wonder why I liked it so much.   The only reason I am actually even writing this review is the lovely and lively older woman that was working. She will brighten anyone's day. She was running the ship politely and efficiently.   Her fellow employees respected her and her customers felt like a million bucks."}
{"text":"From the looks of pics here this place must have been renovated. Slice of pepp and cheese was pretty good for a chain. My wife had the pepp boli and it seemed to me there wasn't enough cheese. There was plenty of staff on hand to move things along."}
{"text":"Wasnt really a big fan. Out in california there pizza at the mall is amazing. Not so much here. Very bland and taste like its been sitting out all day. Maybe i just came on a bad day. The people though that work there are cool."}
{"text":"This is a good spot to get a quick bite before riding the monorail. If you are going through the Paris casino and Ballys, you will end up walking by this Sbarro.  Everything on the menu is definitely high in calories as expected since they specialize in pizza by the slice, but they do have some great Zitti pasta with parmesan chicken. Most of the food was prepared ahead of time, so don't expect it to be piping hot. The service is definitely quick and accurate though.  Perfect place to stop before the train."}
{"text":"Came here for late night eats in the Monte Carlo Hotel & Casino.  Pizza was pizza, nothing spectacular.  Was slightly annoyed that they said the ziti would be out for my sister in 5 minutes and 15 minutes later she still hadn't gotten her food (and I was just about done eating my pizza)."}
{"text":"Worst Sbarro I've ever been to.  The pizza was rubbery and luke warm.  There were plenty of open tables but not one clean one.  The trash cans look like trash cans that come from large corporate restaurants.  The coffee and soda stations were not much cleaner.  Definitely didn't feel as if I was eating in a sanitized environment.  I can understand if they were busy then had would have some excuse.  To top of these interesting experience,  two employees just sat down to eat.  Unbelievable! Management has no regards for cleanliness.  Sbarro,  what happened?!?"}
{"text":"Went to this Sbarros in the Monte Carlo. The food was basic to say the least. I was not really impressed. I got a Hawaiian pizza slice, drink and a salad for $10. My boyfriend got a bowl og meatball marinara pasta for about $10 as well. The sauce looked watery and the taste was just okay. Nothing special. My pizza slice had way to much cheese for my liking. The Caesar salad however was fantastic, but then again, how hard is it to make a ceasar salad. Won't be returning"}
{"text":"OMG sbarros! You guys suck in Las Vegas! The prices were high for no reason, there was no combos, and the flavor of the food was not good :(  And I LOVE the sbarros here in SD, so believe me I know what Sbarros is supposed to taste like."}
{"text":"The food looked good, but I wasn't willing to go into a carb coma.  I got the Caesar Side salad, about 1/1/2 cup of fresh romaine, Parmesian and croutons.  You can choose dressing, I chose the Caesar and used about a tablespoon from the package.  Small salad and bottle of water, $9.50!  Lots of tables, refillable fountain drinks."}
{"text":"This place was simply the first place I saw on my way to the pool at this hotel. I felt the pizza wasn't worth so I got a stromble instead. I only took a bit of the Hawaiian pizza but I felt like it was probably better than the stromble. The Hawaiian pizza was cheesy and sweet cause of the pineapples and along with some tomatoes and jalapeños. For the stromble, I got the pepperoni and sausage which is decent when I took a bit of the peoperoni or sasuage. Most of the time I felt like I was just eating dough.. at least the dough was soft but I'd say its on the pricier side for the small portion. Also, side note: you are not allowed to bring food into the pool. Also, I'd rather not eat then eat this cause there was nothing special imo."}
{"text":"Mediocre fast food at cheap prices: sounds good.  Same mediocre fast food at Vegas prices: WTF?  Beer is available here, but it's 6 bucks a piece for the good stuff. Pizza, even with the coupons was still waaaaaay overpriced.  But, whatcha gonna do in Vegas? Run out to the desert and eat lizards?"}
{"text":"Only one guy was manning the line.   The pizza is ok, nothing great or fancy, and the food is better than Burger King. Two slices of pizza were less than ten dollars."}
{"text":"I LOVE Sbarro and this one is just fine! Always nice to have some NYC style foldable slices while in NC on a delivery. Wish they had more stores but the company must have been run poorly and this chain broke into small scattered pieces :( maybe they will regain some of their old popularity again once day but people suck so probably won't sadly. Oh well Best pizza this side of the Bronx"}
{"text":"Best NYC pizza you can find when you are not in the greatest city on flat earth!!! People complain about the price and I agree it is on the pricey side but if you buy a whole pizza it is a good bit cheaper if you are on a budget or just a cheapskate;)"}
{"text":"So had to get my little man a bite to eat today. Ive liked sbarro since i was younger and he was game for pizza. So while waiting for the pizza the girl mikki was  chatting with me. Great customer service and full of energy. Keep it up girl! While sitting and eating noticed she was great with all customers that arrived. Will come back!"}
{"text":"Fuck this place , this dumb fucking kid doesnt know how to run a oven or apparently put a slice in a box , my slice was fucked up and there is no cheese on my slice its all on the top of the box , never again, he even charged me for a stromboli when i ordered a slice"}
{"text":"My husband still currently working on having a massive coronary before 35 loves this place.  I stop here after work to pick up food for my grease loving hubby.  The folks who work here alway have a smile on their face, though I may be a little bias seeing as they see me at least once a week.  The food is pretty much the same as any other Sbarro but the people who work here make it a fun quick little trip."}
{"text":"Worst customer service. We ordered a couple slices of pizza and a chicken parm. The pizza was good but the chicken parm was not cooked all the way. We went back to the counter and showed then that it was not cooked, the girl looked at it and tossed it in the garbage. Then stood there looking at me. I asked if there was something they could replace it with and she looked at me and said with an attitude what do you want. I asked to change it out for a slice and they girl walked away to ask if she could do that. After 3 min of them talking she came back and said it would have to be another side or I'd have to pay for the slice. I told the girl that we didn't want another side because we weren't sure if they were done and I mentioned that my wife had already ate some with out knowing it was not cooked and she would most likely get sick. The girl shrugged and said yeah well still you'll have to pay for the slice if you want it. Just bad customer service from someone that doesn't care for her job. This place can go sucks it."}
{"text":"I love pizza after drinking, and our first night, we all got slices. The pizza was super salty and bread was a bit cardboard tasting like? I haven't had Sbarro in years, but don't remember it tasting this bad? Wonder if its because its open 24 hours, and the pizza was a bit old? They're not super cheap either, about $5 a slice."}
{"text":"The pizza was bland, dry and had no real flavour to it. The mini caesar salad I got on the side had soft croutons and it was the blandest thing I ever had. The dressing did not help because it tasted weird. I know this is a food court in a mall but this place charges like $5 for a nasty slice. Save yourself the time and effort and go somewhere else. Also, the cashier girl is bland and not pleasant. Not even a thank you on my way out. Never going back!"}
{"text":"I usually like Sbarro, but I had to rate them low today. There was no baked ziti, no spaghetti, and no breadsticks. Had to get pepperoni pizza, which had been under heat lamps too long and was hard."}
{"text":"I ate a slice of pizza, then all I remember is putting my head down and I was KO'd.  Oh Vegas..."}
{"text":"The pizza is extremely greasy. It literally soaked through the cardboard box and left a grease outline on the table. Good thing the table was already dirty when I sat down! Most of the cheese slid off (probably because of the grease) with my first bite. The crust tasted like cardboard - it was just a nasty slice of pizza. The trash cans were overflowing, the floor was filthy, gross all around!"}
{"text":"Dudes, NO!  The pizza looked hella fresh, but tasted hella yucky! The breadsticks were soaked in garlic butter and just tasted awkward.  Idc if the price is 2$ or 10$ just make it yummy! You cant eff up pizza, but this place totally did! And the cashiers are little punks too!"}
{"text":"Staff was friendly and service was quick. Only one of the registers was working. Ordered the small spaghetti and it was the biggest ripoff. $4 for a little bowl of unsalted, watery, old noodles with a spoon of sour tomato sauce on top. Got a stomach ache before I could get back to my room upstairs."}
{"text":"I would give this place 0 stars if I could.   Airport food starts at 2 stars and goes down from there.  The food at this Sbarros was abyssmal.  I ordered a baked ziti which came with a garlic roll.  The roll had no garlic taste to it and the baked ziti was dry to the bone with barely any sauce.  I had a sour stomach for the rest of my connecting 2.5 hour flight.  Ugh!!!"}
{"text":"Here is the good news...this place is open 24 hours a day!  Do I really need pizza at 4am?  I have asked that question to myself many times in Las Vegas!!!  My mind always says yes but my body says no!!!  I have read the other reviews and it seems like everyone has had terrible experiences here.  I have not because I only eat three things at Sbarro and I can never go wrong.  A pizza slice, a salad and/or a beer.  See how simple that is.  Never go here for the pasta...it looks so gross and it is sitting in sauce and under hot lights all day long.  Just walk away because it is not going to be good.  Do not let the girl talk you into upgrading for a few bucks more...you really do not need those extra sides.  The staff here is always nice unless the manager is here making them nervous.  Bosses make everything harder.  So if you follow my advice just stick to the simple things here like a pizza and a beer and everything will be okay.  Also this location is located in the walkway near the monorail...so you can grab some food before you jump on the train."}
{"text":"Prices are bold, the pizza slices are thin. The pizzas are covered with a questionable mixture of something, that in the menu is described as a mix of cheeses and pepperoni. Actually, my slice was a huge piece of bread covered with a tiny layer of something. I say something by reason because the taste was tasteless and almost anything could taste like that.  \"Italian pizza style\"...please! Have you ever been to Italy? The choice is reduced to several types of pizza, I mean a loaf of bread covered with different types of mixtures.  The prices are bold as a bold could be.  Well, you pay  $4+ per one slice ?!?!? To be honest, for this part of the city the price is average. However, the price/quality tag is under question. I found the service friendly. The place is open 24/7 in the area there no many options to chose from."}
{"text":"Remember when Sbarro used to be pretty good mall pizza? Well, they left the malls in Tucson quite some time ago so when we had a layover in Charlotte, Sbarro sounded like a good choice. Wrong. Oh so wrong.  I ordered a slice of pepperoni pizza, a Greek salad and a soft drink. Pricey but whatever, I'm in the airport. What I wasn't expecting is how awful the food was. My salad was full of limp lettuce and quite a few pieces were browning pretty badly. My pizza was tasteless and nondescript. It would be nice if they tried to keep the place a little cleaner - the place wasn't even packed so it wouldn't have been hard.  Best part of my meal? The root beer."}
{"text":"I know it's fast food mall food, but they spin their own dough and they home make the marinara.  Lots of garlic and goodness here.  One of the best mall pizza joints I have been too.  Maybe I got there when everything is fresh, but I was impressed with there quality and service."}
{"text":"I came here twice during our Vegas stay.  Like the other reviews, don't come here for the service.  The service the second time was a little bit better though.  We had the spaghetti, pizza, and calzone both times.  It was crowded both times we were there but it was convenient and since the pizzas are the by the slice, it made it easy to have everyone pick what they want."}
{"text":"Decent \"food court\" pizza in Bally's food court, lots of varieties and other Italianish dishes plus breakfast dishes at that time of day.  Real easy access from E Flamingo Rd was good as I was staying at Bill's, 2 minute walk.  Had late night pizza here once and early lunch/late breakfast the next morning.  Wasn't crowded either time but pizza was fresh, staff was good and price was OK (don't order bottled water...cost me 6 bucks!)"}
{"text":"What the Hell happened? Bad food with equally BAD service and bad Attitude from Staff. THIS PLACE TOOK A NOSE DIVE from good to Terrible food with lousy service. WHAT HAPPENED? Is this a TAX write off NOW? The quality of food and service went from VERY GOOD to VERY BAD! Food is greasy, smaller portions, smaller slices & thin, it use to be Thick, rich & zesty. Pizza was Bigger, Baked Zita use to be excellent. Nothing Good Now.This was a good go to place for PIZZA, CALZONES, Salads, etc. Everything Was Fresh & Tasty, real decent NY ITALIAN-NOW ITS LIKE CALIFORNIA CRAP! It's Too Bad, We miss the OLD Sbarros with GOOD FOOD, NOW We Will JUST WALK ON BY! Horrible food lately. RAISE YOUR STANDARDS & FOOD QUALITY! BRING BACK NY VALUES & NY QUALITY! Sbarros always had a good reputation back East with good food quality, go back to basics, or it's Your FUNERAL! Sbarros is Now an embarrassment ! It's really a shame, hopefully they make a comeback & nice recovery.  2 Stars 4 encouragement. Rise up Again Sbarros !"}
{"text":"The service at this location was horrible. They are supposed to start serving lunch at 11am. We get in line at about 11:15am and I ordered  some pasta and sauce for my niece. I was told they don't serve that until 11am and I reminded the lady it was 11:15am and she said it will be out in 3 minutes. No big deal we can wait a few minutes. So in about 3 minutes I saw the cook bring the food out so I'm thinking great we are going to get our food now. No, instead I watched them serve many other people. So finally after 5 minutes go by I asked asked for the food and they finally gave it to us. Just a bit more customer service and the situation could've been rectified."}
{"text":"Fastest place to grab some hot food near the C gates at CLT airport but it's pretty subpar pizza. Also watch out there's two different prices for pizza - one for normal and one for specialty. Either way it's going to be $4.50-$5.50 for a slice which is pricey for the taste and quality."}
{"text":"Got food poisoning from eating a Caesar salad/and Meat Stromboli here yesterday. I didn't eat anything before or after all. It's been the worse feeling so far."}
{"text":"Really good breakfast strombolis here!  Got the veggie Stromboli as I was rushing through terminal C to my gate.  Service was friendly and helpful.  Food was nice, hot and very fresh.  Flavors were really good.   I'd stop in here for food when in this terminal again sometime!"}
{"text":"Disgusting. Even the picture here looks disgusting. Not at all like the Sbarros in the US which are actually decent; maybe Canada shouldn't have Sbarro. Pizza tastes like plastic and chemicals and pasta is obvious at first sight as being not cooked in the tradition al dente way and even might be processed or something. Food is lukewarm and sometimes even cold. Do not waste your money here. And oh yeah, bringing me to my last point, it's horribly overpriced. Employees are stupid. A pathetic pre-recorded voice machine announces \"Hey there, welcome to Sbarro\" to attract patrons passing by who I hope don't bother. Just don't."}
{"text":"Fast food pizza! The lady taking my order kept sneezing! She told me that she's been sneezing all day! I told her she should go home.  Yep go home and stop sneezing on people's food.  The guy who was at the pay cashier looked like he was distracted or maybe just needed a vacation. I told him what I ordered so I can pay for it, then 5 seconds later he said \"oh I'm sorry what did you order again?\" He then went to get the pizzas out of the oven. He dropped one of the pizzas on the floor. He came up to me and said \"ma'am I'm sorry but I dropped your pepperoni pizza. Can I get you anything else?\" Uh another pizza?! Lmao!! What does he expect? There was a whole pizza pie of pepperoni there and he asked me if I wanted anything else? Wtf?! Go get me another slice! Duhh!!!"}
{"text":"I thought the pizza was pretty good! Not as bad as I thought. The environment was good too. Overall I enjoyed this experience."}
{"text":"I think even for mall pizza you got to give it a three. It's good but because it's in the mall it's a little bit pricey I think the food sits there a while because of the mall"}
{"text":"Ah, Sbarro: the mainstay of every mall or food court since I can remember. With their large pizzas, variety of sides, and large drinks, how can you not like this place?  On my last trip here, I came with some friends to get some food in our systems before/during/after beers. We all three ordered the meal which consisted of a slice of pizza, a delicious side, and a drink. In my case, I got a pepperoni pizza, toasted mini potatoes, and a Pepsi. I should mention that they had like 5 different kids of pizza ready to serve up (pepperoni, ham/pineapple, cheese, sausage, jalapeno, stuffed...) which they warm up for you really quickly before serving it. As for the quality of my pizza? It was good. It was nothing to write home about, but it was good. I think the crust was kinda bland, but otherwise I was happy with it. The little potatoes they served me were pretty good, too. My friends ordered the pasta on the side, and they were happy with their food selections as well. As a matter of fact, they were happy enough with their sides that they ate them before the pizza and said it was a 5-star meal, though I was erring on the side of 3. (Thus the four-star rating)  Service here is always pretty quick and simple. Prices are ok (I paid like 7.80 for the meal, which is pretty good for the amount of food!) I'll keep coming back here when I'm in the Texas, for sure!"}
{"text":"Just a normal sbarros inside the ballys hotel. Good strombole.  Directions: enter the 'sports book' entrance and it is on the left. If coming in from main lobby, go straight and down to pool level. Walk all the way down the hall and it is at the end."}
{"text":"For a quick, airport stop at 7 in the morning, I have nothing but good things to say. The food was fresh, the service was fast, and I didn't have to have a \"breakfast sandwich.\" I was starving when we went after running around for the holiday season and I needed real sustenance. The pizza was hot and fresh and I got a side of veggies that were delicious. My boyfriend got a calzone that was amazing with or without the marinara. I'd eat there again, on the run."}
{"text":"as a kid, i remember going to sbarro in the malls back in illinois. even as a teenager, we would still hit up sbarro. i remember the pizza being huge slices of super thin, delicious, greasy pizza.  i dont know what happened. the gf and i were at fashion square and i thought i could relive my youth.  i could not have been more wrong. talk about garbage pizza. i had a slice of cheese and a slice of pepperoni. the pizza tasted and looked like it was just a reheated, frozen pizza. the crust sucked, the slice was small with a thicker crust, the sauce tasted like sweet artificiality. and not \"sweet\" as in \"good,\" \"sweet\" as in too much sugar.\" and the cheese congealed in about 30 secs to a weird, fake cheese consistency.  they also had other italian entrees sitting in the trays, but these looked like they had been sitting in the same spot since the mall opened that morning.  the gf made fun of me when i said i was going to yelp the sbarros at the mall . . . but i want to save anyone else from having their teenage mall memories drowned in gross tomato sauce and crappy crust."}
{"text":"Nothing special just wuick food when your hungry ....the spaghetti sauce needs be greatly reduced...as it was way to watery ....but the carrot cake was pretry bomb though"}
{"text":"Did you lose big at the tables? Were the slot machines too greedy or are you just hungry? Well, you could eat it all away here. The escalators leading to the basement level are near the last row of slot machines on the game floor.  $4.95 a slice from Sbarro is ridiculous, but the size sort of makes up for it. The pizza toppings vary throughout the day, but you're most likely to find \"the usual\" (pepperoni, sausage, or cheese), veggie slices, and a pepperoni and sausage combination. Don't forget to ask them if they could heat it up for you. If pizza isn't your thing, there is pasta (i.e., baked ziti) and stromboli. The pepperoni and cheese stromboli was a bit dry and underwhelming; the dough was the perfect thickness and golden brown. If neither of those appeal to you, there are side salads available among other sides you could choose from.  If I were you, don't even bother with the overpriced drinks here. Just head to the CVS a few yards away from the hotel's entrance and save yourself a buck or two. The food court is large, so there is plenty of seating and a couple of flat screens to keep you...uh, entertained. Most of the staff are friendly, although some are inexpressive."}
{"text":"In my opinion Sbarro is to Italian food what Panda Express is to Chinese food.     When I am hanging out in Sunset Station and just do not want to wait on the long Feast Buffet line, and am not up for the other Sunset Station eateries, I'll eat here. I'll admit that at almost $10, the number 3 that I prefer is a bit pricey for fast food.  Then what fast food place isn't these days. I am a chicken parmigiana fan. The chicken parmigiana offered as a number 3 tastes good. However it isn't on a level with Italian restautants like Metro  Pizza. The potatoes that  I order as my side, also tastes good. I'll eat the bread if I am really hungry."}
{"text":"Ok so when it's around 2 am and you just won a good amount of money on the nickle slots, what do you do?  You celebrate with some Sbarro pizza, that's what you do.  I got one slice of pepperoni and mushroom and it hit the spot.  Ok when you're in a hurry and need something quick."}
{"text":"Hadn't been here since I worked there when I was 18. At the McCarran Airport, I stopped by for something quick and predictable. A slice of Hawaiian pizza pie and 2 meatballs were delicious and predictable. I loved it! The pizza was soft and fresh and huge (you have to fold the slice). The meatballs were very tasty, and the red gravy was tangy and delicious.   I was eyeballing that lasagna or baked ziti, but I had plenty of food. Sbarro's is pretty good! Still I have to reserve 4's for great food and 5's for perfect."}
{"text":"Wow the pizza is cold and pepperoni is falling off like an afterthought ...WTH sbarro?  Now mediocre isn't even bad enough u have to go sub par with it... Smh"}
{"text":"Yep.  I came to Vegas to eat pizza i could have anytime at home.  And it was soooooo good!"}
{"text":"The worst pizza I've ever had.  And it was super dry and face like crap.  Plus i asked for water and they refused to give me some. Don ever never get pizza here. Never ever."}
{"text":"Late night, in a casino and you're hungry, what do you do? You go to the food court and hope something is edible.  Where other places ran about 2x normal price, Sbarro's seemed to be only 1.5 the price, so it was a \"deal\".   The husbeast and I ended up getting a calzone like thing that was pretty tasty, with a side of sauce to dip it in, the $2.50 water was better priced than most things on the strip - or even in the hotel at large.  If the dudebro who was in line before me hadn't spilled beer on me, it might have been an overall good experience."}
{"text":"The pasta was over cooked, so much butter that the sauce wouldn't stay on, the breadsticks were burnt on the bottom, the lettuce was old, and the cashier was so rude and had no patience at all. The servers were kinder but had no communication between them. I wouldn't ever go back"}
{"text":"Absolutely THE WORST airport food I've ever had. I  ended up throwing the entire Spinach and Mozzarella Stomboli out after 2 bites. Disgusting. The cleanliness of the restaurant as a whole has much to be desired.  The tables are old and dirty, and the floors are cracked and look as if they haven't been cleaned in days.  Sbarro's has been a trusted brand of mine for years, but if this is an indication of things to come with this company, I won't be a customer in the future."}
{"text":"The only reason I eat here, is that I prefer this food to the food I get served (at work) in the Orleans EDR(Employee Dining Room)  Sabarro's can be a hit and miss. Sometimes you can get a good slice and sometimes you can get a charcoaled slice. The charcoaled slice consists of them sticking the slice in the oven to heat it up and you get the black burnt parts from the oven.  I like the pepperoni, but I don't like the pepperoni slices they use.  The staff is friendly.  Basically pizza is... When it's bad, it's still pretty good."}
{"text":"Enjoyed our food. Didn't expect much from a food court Italian place. My husband loved the Stromboli although it was far too greasy. I just had cheese pizza and it was fine. May go back again for a Stromboli."}
{"text":"the pizza is always very consistent and the staff is always pretty friendly too quick service and it's always nice when they slide the slices in the oven right before you eat. :)"}
{"text":"I was trying to save money by finding somewhere cheap to eat at the airport. Sbarro was the answer. I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, which comes with one garlic bread. The portion was large and filling. The meatballs were delicious and blended well with the marinara sauce. The spaghetti noodles was good. I had gotten a fresh batch, so that was good. The garlic bread was slightly dry and did not have enough butter."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten here for years.  Why?  I found a big, fat fly between two pieces of lettuce in my salad.  When I told the manager, he didn't apologize.  Rather, he accused me of putting it in there myself.  Really?  Does the guy think I carry around flies, just waiting to put them in things so I can get free food?  Ludicrous.  I know it's mall food and it's all kinda sub-par, but being dirty is unacceptable."}
{"text":"I am disgusted that I succumbed to eating here, but I was starving and there was no place for me to grab food until I landed in Austin. Unfortunately, Sbarro happened to be the first restaurant that I saw after I landed in Charlotte. I ordered a slice of pizza, a spinach roll, and a water. I left $16 poorer and queasy. P.S. staff is rude."}
{"text":"I have been in this place several times to hope for the best, seeing that I have been to many sbarro locations, and the food wasn't bad. This location never gets any better, and I've tried three times and everytime is horrible.   The price for this unpleasant dried up, not enough toppings pizza is distressing. They can clearly see that the pizza looks even gross under the heat lamp and do not switch the pizza out enough. More bread than anything on the pizza.  I won't eat here again, because I tried many times and I am just wasting my money."}
{"text":"I don't understand why these places ask for tips when they give you absolutely shitty service. Whatever, it's cheap food for Vegas. But get rid of asking for tips on the receipt and the tip jar cause if you make no effort in a town built on hospitality you don't deserve a tip."}
{"text":"Do you hear that? That's the sound of a failed franchise that's trying it's very best to tap out and leave this world, yet continues to be kept on life support against it's own will. Sbarro is an old war horse that's been through many brutal wars (read: bankruptcies) and has weathered many storms (read: ownership issues) It's worn, decrepit body doesn't even have the strength to beg for rest, let alone mercy.   Yet here I am, pitching in a few dollars towards the hospital bill to keep ol' Sbarro alive. Feels bad, man -- and that's not just the emptiness I feel after I eat. I feel something else too: GUILT. I've been contributing toward keeping flavorless, dry crust on the market, a crust that favors the flavor profile of cardboard than it does anything remotely related to pizza.  I've helped a slice stay alive that manages to be a simultaneous two-punch body blow of soggy AND needing more sauce. Even with a heavy hand on the seasonings, the fact still remains: this is garbage.   She's dead, Jim. She's dead. Well, she should be anyway, and I pledge to finally stop being cruel to her -- and the rest of the marketplace.   It's time you rest now, Sbarro. You might be cold now, but you'll feel warm in a bit (just like your pizza.) Just close your eyes, and walk towards the light."}
{"text":"They dont let u add extra topping.. dont reheat pizza... granted it is airport but still... mushroom.puzza have 3 or 4 small shrooms.. nah dawg... yall trippin"}
{"text":"Food court. Good for a quick bite. Slices are large. Garlic bread pretty bland. They reheat your pizza in oven once you order it. Bit in the expensive side and high calories but if your looking for a quick bite- this place is great."}
{"text":"Go to The Orleans Hotel and Casino and you will find Sharro at the food court.  Stromboli ($6.69); Our sausage, pepperoni & bacon meatball was slightly too bread-y. Meatball ($1.99): kinda dry :(  The worker looked unhappy and she threw the meatball container on top of the wrapped stromboli. I opened the bag at the counter and the meatball sauce leaked out. Please stay home if you don't feel like working. Just saying....  2 stars!!  Sbarro is not yummylicious!!"}
{"text":"This place, doesnt deserve even 1 star.. they are such a B*tch... wont take my order and they dont even have any customer in line... giving me a f*ckin' attitude :/  They need to train their employee, how to provide good customer service..."}
{"text":"It's just okay. If you're craving pizza and stuck on a long layover, this is a good place to go. But I tend to think that the pizza and other things are really overpriced. It's not just like that in airports, I've been to other locations outside of airports and it's the same way. Their Pizza is pretty good, their breadsticks lacked any flavor, I can't say anything about their pastas. The salad was pretty good. They are really good at getting you in and out fast for the most part. I've eaten at this location multiple times when flying through and the food is consistently pretty good. Not great, just good. But then again what airport food is delicious?"}
{"text":"PUSHY PUSHY PUSHY ass staff. I barely had time to say hi before I was asked if I was ready. Repeatedly. The girl just kept saying \"anything else?\" Even though I told her we needed a minute. We ordered a calzone and it was just heavy. My bf and I split it, and I still felt like I over ate. So much grease. My stomach still hurts from eating it. I would never go back. Ever"}
{"text":"This Sbarro is now CLOSED at the Texas Station Casino...that's too bad because I had a free slice on a coupon and I found it to be quite good.  Went back today and found it shut down due to Sbarro's bankruptcy.  So, that's the latest!"}
{"text":"Pizza was good but they don't have free cups of water. They make you buy a bottle of water that costs $2.29  for a small 17 oz. Bottle. Where as you can buy a full case of 32 for that price. And the workers aren't very nice either especially the older woman."}
{"text":"$4.50 for a slice of pizza wasn't the worse of it. It is grease overload. I had to use 4 napkins to soak it all in. The pizza was OK, they are open late so I suppose the greasyness will be 10x better when drunk."}
{"text":"This was honestly the worst \"Italian\" food I've ever had and that includes having dined at various other Sbarro locations. I hit up this location as I was en route to New York and it was the most convenient option and well-trafficked by other diners so I thought \"what the heck?\". I ordered a Sausage & Mozz stromboli because 1.) I was starving 2.) it just needed to be heated up and wouldn't take long to be ready and 3.) it was a nice compromise in size since one slice of pizza may not have been enough and two probably would have been too much.  The stromboli was brought out of the oven looking appetizing enough and sufficiently heated up. That was the best part of my experience. The bottom of it was as hard as a plank of wood and when I tried to cut into with a plastic knife, I was unsuccessful. Even if I had used actual silverware, I would have faced a challenge. I tore it with my hands because I wanted to be able to more easily dip it in the marinara sauce that I got.  The inside was a little mushy, as if the dough hadn't properly cooked. The sausage had zero flavor and they seemed to want to compensate by just piling on more cheese...which was similarly tasteless.   The marinara sauce that accompanied it was watery and it, too, lacked flavor. Heck, even the sodas that were in the fridge were barely cooler than room temperature so I couldn't even get satisfaction from my Coca Cola.  I really don't like to slam a place but I also don't like to mislead others with my reviews either. I hope they evaluate this location and make some big changes immediately. Luckily, they are inside CLT airport and, thus, benefit from constant traffic and visited by people whom they don't expect to be regulars. I'm sure others, like me, come here due to brand recognition and the convenience of its location. I'd be curious as to how many people who have eaten here would come back if given the chance."}
{"text":"Typical Sbarro pizza but when you're hungry and the other stuff is closed there's nothing better than average pizza. Pizza was alright but kind of greasy and it was entertaining watching the one employee awkwardly trying to flirt with the woman ahead of me in line with her husband right there."}
{"text":"Yes, the food is overpriced, but come on, every food place I've been to in a Vegas hotel is overpriced. My dad loves coming here for their nice and toasted, oven baked pizza. We stay at Caesar's Palace but don't mind the walk from there to Bally's. This place is great for the late night munchies. The pizza is fresh and the workers are friendly. What more can you ask for? Yea Sbarro! :)"}
{"text":"I know every mall has a Sbarros and I'm surprised to find one in Ballys. Average pizza for a good price compared to Serendipity outside Caesar's Palace which is highway robbery.   Great for the traveler on a budget.  For quick access to Sbarros without stepping foot in the casino,  just keep walking past the valet to the side of the building along Flamingo Blvd and you'll see glass doors that enter into the basement and it will be straight on your left side along with other fast food chains."}
{"text":"Umm, don't do it. Just don't do it. I've eaten Sbarro in other places and they are known for delicious lasagna and their cucumber salad...This place, not so much. I'll never do Sbarro's HERE again."}
{"text":"Lets be honest. I wasn't expecting great food from the food court at the mall. Much to my surprise the pizza was excellent! So were the bread sticks.   I had the pleasure of being served by the general manager Travis. Talk about customer service. Super nice and good at up selling me on a bigger drink that comes with free refills. :)  I really do appreciate that! I was there with my wife and kids and we had a great time. Thank you for surpassing my expectations."}
{"text":"Just had an old, stale piece of cardboard that was supposed to be pepperoni pizza! Place dirty; check out SO SLOW. I usually like Sbarro.....not this place! My recommendation...stay away!!!"}
{"text":"$3.50 for a \"large\" fountain Pepsi (ice and about 12oz of soda).  The price tainted the experience completely."}
{"text":"The people working here look and act like they hate life. I had to grab an employee's attention to ask about toppings on the pizza that was out in front. Then when I asked how much a slice was, he acted like an ass about it. The lady who rang me up was much nicer, thank God. As for the pizza itself it was actually pretty tasty, we got sausage and pepperoni. The crust was amazing. However the next day it was so inconsistent. The crust was a few millimeters thick and so thin. Yes! The same exact pizza was different the next day, what gives?"}
{"text":"Avoid at all costs. I've been to tons of Sbarro's in my lifetime, but this one's pizza is uneatable. I tried to eat it after a night on the town and it was pretty gross. Sorry guys just go to McDonald's."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim and highly regretted it. I ordered a basic meat ball pasta (it was penne) and it took for ever even though it was all ready in the hot table. They got my order wrong multiple times so it took almost 20 minutes to get my food and leave Being located on a very busy food court, I expected it to be fast.  As for the actual food, it was bad... Buying frozen dinner would taste a lot better. The pasta was bland, soggy, and left a pretty bad after taste.   I would definitely advise others to not come."}
{"text":"We've tried so many pizza places on the strip and nothing beats this place. So much more affordable and the pizzas are always delicious. Just recently the service has been great even in the later hours.  There's a male Hispanic employee who is super friendly! Lines never seem to get too crowded, so even if you need to walk down to get to the food court, you'll be chowing down in no time. Lots of space available for seating. We went back a 2nd time within the hour!"}
{"text":"Let's see.  Overpriced pizza, not well done but it'll do if you want something small and right at the montecarlo. I was hungry and figured why not get this. It wasn't great so I won't go again but if you just want something small go for it."}
{"text":"Nice selections but I would put the hot food before the pizza and you dont see it until you go to pay. Expensive but it did hit the spot"}
{"text":"I love the place the pizza is always fresh because it's in the Orleans casino. The price is a little higher but each time you get a 20 percent off coupon doing a survey for the next visit. Everyone is nice and the food court is clean. Sometimes you meet famous people I met Chali Pinkston  professional barrel racer and designer of the C3 saddle."}
{"text":"Inside the Orleans Hotel....this Sbarro isn't bad. It is located by the parking garage and poker tables and serves its purpose if you're hungry and need some carbs to fill you up. When you think of Vegas...you think of gourmet. Sbarro is fast food Italian. They open early and close late, perfect for Vegas! I ate here a few times when I stayed at the Orleans. When you're actually in Vegas for something other than partying and gambling, and you're there for a softball and paintball tournament, Sbarro serves its purpose for quick eats.   The service is good here if I remember, the food actually came out fresh and hot, plenty of seating, smiles from the cashier and food servers. When you're working fast food inside a Vegas hotel and you can still be happy to be at work...that's good in my books."}
{"text":"Pizza is ok. Pasta is nasty. Employees are careless and annoying. Check the receipt, up grades drinks without asking."}
{"text":"I had a great experience at this Sbarros! The food was good, our order was ready quickly, and the guy who helped us was very nice and very helpful. I didn't expect such great service at a pizza place in a mall, but I will visit them again for sure."}
{"text":"Somehow I always end up at this boring chain place.  It always sounds better than it actually tastes.  This past time I went the pizza really was crunchy due to heat lamps then re-heated in the oven.  There is a Nathan's next door.  I think I will go there from now on."}
{"text":"Had a quick little snack here at the Monte Carlo. Not much to review about here. Its just pizza that isn't that great. I was just in the mood for pizza and had to settle for this. Still reminds me of fast food joint even though some consider it not to be. I am a sucker for pizza so I just had to put an extra star for that fact (yes my rating is a bit bias) but at least I'm mentioning it here in my review so you guys will know if you do read my reviews. I also like the fact that they have a few other choice like pasta other than just pizza."}
{"text":"I definitely will stop here again!   Good veggies in the culinary no man's land of the C terminal at McCarran.  The only other food I could find which was vegan in this terminal was the veggie burger at Burger King and a veggie burrito (hold the cheese) at some Mexican chain.  If you are looking for truly healthy food, get the vegetable \"side\" topped with marinara.  Not overcooked, but lightly steamed pieces of broccoli, winter squash, zucchini, and carrots.  Very high nutrient to calorie ratio, healthy eating in the midst of slot machines and fast food junk.  Plus, right across from the counter is a bunch of tables right along the wall which are relatively private."}
{"text":"I threw up and I had diarrhea for 2 days after eating. NEVER AGAIN. I feel like I had food poisoning from this place and I reported it already. I am still sick today and that's how terrible this place is!"}
{"text":"It's a Sbarro. Same as anywhere else, but more expensive since its in a Vegas food court. Got the meats pizza, came out of the warmer hot, and tasted just like any other Sbarro pizza."}
{"text":"If you've had Sbarro pizza in your mall food court, then you will be familiar with the pizza here at Sbarro in the airport. It's high crust, low sauce, reasonable toppings. And it's not cheap at around $5 for a plain cheese slice.  The pizza has the advantage of being ready to go almost immediately and it is completely portable. Which is great for an airport.  They have fountain and bottled drinks to go as well."}
{"text":"Went Saturday night 5-9-15 around 7:30 PM.    I got a slice of cheese pizza ($3.29) and two meatballs($3.58 for two).   The cheese pizza was really exquisite...very fresh and crunchy on the bottom, but the meatballs were lukewarm and I burped them up for two days.  I think maybe they had been out for a while."}
{"text":"Best  pizza crust in Vegas! The service was fast, friendly and orderly. Ordered the Canadian bacon with pineapple toppings, just as great as every time I've eaten. Also ordered the side Caesar salad and Mac and cheese. yum o. recommend for tasty fast food in between the gambling and movies."}
{"text":"LISTEN TO THE VICTIMS!  I usually scoff at ppl who write reviews about chain restaurants, ESPECIALLY fast food, but now I see why - you can get better meals at strip clubs with no cover.  what started as a quick bite under 5 turned into 17, as the girl pushed a \"deal of 11.99\" - drink not included (additional 3 bucks).  the pizza crust was cracker-hard from repeated reheating, the wings tasted like I was eating them off someone's plate who left them behind, and although the breadsticks were drenched in butter and cheese, they still somehow tasted like dough.  STAY AWAY.  a homeless guy begging for food would pass on it if you offered him your leftovers."}
{"text":"Pretty much as the other bad reviews say.  I had one slice of Hawaiian pizza - the bottom was rubbery, the pizza was greasy and the cheese tasted like, ugh...and to add insult to injury, it was over $6.   The tables weren't cleaned off and the floor is filthy and the restaurant in general. Cashier and staff not very hospitable.   This location definitely does not match the standards of other Sbarros. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Good filling food in a hurry. I needed to get a quick bite before my working lunch started. Two slices of meat pizza and a medium drink. The price, just over $10 was inline with the amount of food. The pizza was fresh and tasty. I stay at Bally's a few time a year and will be back here to grab another quick bite."}
{"text":"This is a small thing, but if you are known for pizza, try to have pizza.  It's not a particularly busy night, and as I waited during late dinner hour, they ran out of cheese, then pepperoni.  That's like going to a McDonalds, and they run out of French fries.  Then the wait got compounded because something was wrong with the cash register, and at first, they had one person ringing up about ten people in line.  Management here is not solid.  I would have let it all go, but the pizza also had too much crust to cheese ratio.  Pizza fail tonight."}
{"text":"Located in the Bally's food court.  Open 24/7 which is very convenient at 4am after the clubs close out (as is Subway next door).  Plenty of seating.  $5/slice is pricey but you can get a whole pizza for $17 which is more worth it."}
{"text":"Ok ok I know this place is a chain but man I gotta comment on their service...  So upon checking in you get coupons you can use around the casino, one of them can be used at Sbarro. I thought hey why not grab a slice and save a bit. Well guess I can't use it because I got a combo and according to the employee I saved a lot already. Um SERIOUSLY?! Ok so I let that go..then I asked for an extra plate and some napkins..well the manager have me two pieces of napkins. Wtheck am I gonna do with two pieces of napkins?! One word: STINGY!!!"}
{"text":"Sbarro... How you disappoint me! So I go to Sbarro after walking the strip in Vegas, and oh man does pizza sound good. We walk in and see the jacked up price, $9.99 for a slice and breadsticks. I got pepperoni and sausage an it tasted like cardboard, and felt like it as well. Also, if it says \"breadsticks\" on the menu, usually this means more than 1. But I guess at this Sbarro it means only 1, no arguing! All in all very disappointed!"}
{"text":"Their spinach and broccoli stuffed pizza drew me in and made me order it.  I haven't had that in so long and it sounded so much better than the lame (healthy) Subway sandwich I'd planned.  It may be $3.99 a slice, but it's so huge and yummy - it's a super filling meal.  And it's spinach, broccoli and cheese!    I really like Sbarros.  It's a nice option from much of the other mall food.  I've tried their lasagna and baked ziti before, and they were ok.  But the real winner to me is always their pizza. The stuffed pizza particularly.  Get an extra side of sauce to pour on top and you're set.    It may not be fancy food, but at least it's not deep fried orange, honey or teriyaki flavored overly-breaded chicken bits over rice like I was offered at different spots on my way over here."}
{"text":"This Sbarros is inside Orleans. We go to the movies there a lot so when you get out your hungry head down and the food court is on the way out to the parking lot.  At night I think the food sits way too long and you feel rushed trying to decide what you want to eat. They push trying some piece of garlic bread which is hard and has no taste.  I am not a big fan of their pizza. I think it is either too greasy or too doughy.  The pasta dishes taste too over cooked and the sauce like tomato paste. Not a fan and have had WAY better in Vegas!  Don't bother if you know whats good for you! Subway down from them is much better!"}
{"text":"Rarely do we leave 1 star.  But this deserved it in a big way.  I've often has Sbarro food in many different places and the food is usually very good.  Actually I've had amazing pizza in several locations.  This was horrible.  $6 for a slice of pizza where the staff makes you feel invisible and the restaurant is filthy.  Look at the floors.....ouch!!  This unit is a blip in the system, but hopefully they'll read this!  Zero staff interaction with customers, only themselves...restaurant was filthy and food was cold."}
{"text":"The food is good.. the service is slow, the cashier  was chatting with this woman for 5 minutes then says i am from New York your from New York I'm going to give you 10 percent off.. that was a slap in my face that because she is from New York you get a discount"}
{"text":"I had a slice of the stuffed pizza.  Can't remember what they call it.  It was a large piece, it was flavorful but awfully greezy.  This place was conveniently located right across the aisle from my gate, so, I suppose that was a plus.  Ok, for a quick bite when you're running on empty."}
{"text":"Staff was nice food was terrible. I'll never eat here again."}
{"text":"??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????(^^)"}
{"text":"Went at 1030 am for pizza sticks the manager says 20 min. I was like ok cool I will come back. I come back at 1130. He says they take along time to make but you said 20 min... It's early in the am Noone in the food court.  Not even lunch time so why you frustrated and angry. Well I walked to chick Fila much more happier.... I won't go back.."}
{"text":"Worst ever. Cold pizza, when I brought it back to the counter, they had no idea what to do. They were upset with me for saying something. Unbelievable!"}
{"text":"Absolutely TERRIBLE service! My family and I went there on our way back to the hotel, and my dad stood in line to make his order. However, the employees there completely ignored him and continued to serve at least two other parties behind him. When my dad reached out and politely asked them to take his order, an employee told him that he would have to wait until he rings up the group behind him, even though he already served a man behind my dad just a few seconds beforehand. No one even greeted my dad, asked him to wait (until he had to initiate the interaction), or simply acknowledge that he was there. It is, BY FAR, the worst service we have had the misfortune of encountering, and there was absolutely no excuse since it was not at all busy. I work in the dining services myself so I often do sympathize with the employees, but this is beyond understanding. I definitely would not recommend anybody to spend their money here! The only reason why I gave them one star is because I had to in order to post this review up. If it was up to me, they would not have earned any at all."}
{"text":"Store says they are open 24/7 but just tried to eat there and they were closed.  The store needs to change e their hours to reflect that they close for maintenance."}
{"text":"As good or bad as any Sbarro's (the same...), so take your pick.  The pizza we had was tasty enough, cheap, and the place is open 24 hours.  They also have pitchers of beer!  Can't complain about this place- one of the highlights of Bally's for sure!"}
{"text":"You go here for airport food..that's what you good. Pizza by the slice, stromboli's and lasagna.  Had to have some food before my flight...it's adequate."}
{"text":"It's a Sbarro so if you're expecting great, or even good, Italian food you're WAY off. However if your expectations are in line, this version of the chain delivers their food quickly and from a friendly counter staff.  Seriously.. In an airport anything more than that is probably deserving of 5 stars!"}
{"text":"The pizza was so bland I couldn't believe it was from Sbarro.  The gentleman's body language behind the counter was that of a person who couldn't care any less and seemed put off by basic questions about the menu.  Not to mention, thug tattoos everywhere.  Oh yeah, 6 bucks for one slice and almost 8 bucks for a beer.  Trust me, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"This could officially be some of the worst pizza I have eaten. It truly was a slab of half cooked dough with tomato paste on top. In addition there was just absolutely no flavor at all to the pizza. If stuck in the convention center all day again I would choose to not eat and save my $5 or $6 bucks. Very disappointing pizza.   Now I know why Sbarro is only in malls, airports and convention centers."}
{"text":"It was mediocre at best. Had a Stromboli, which was massive to begin with and then they tacked on two breadsticks for the combo. I'm not sure how they expect someone to eat that much dough. Only managed about 50% of the Stromboli. The quality just wasn't there."}
{"text":"I understand this is a chain place but food taste terrible and service was just as bad"}
