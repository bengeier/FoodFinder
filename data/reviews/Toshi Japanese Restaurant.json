{"text":"I used to work in the building where Toshi is and would often have lunch there.  Our company moved and I will confess I have visited both at lunch and supper and I really miss this place! The food is fresh and completely scrumptious"}
{"text":"Good authentic Japanese restaurant in Brampton, ON. They serve good quality and valued foods on both of their take out and restaurant business. I have eaten at many authentic Japanese restaurants in Japan and eating here brings me back of those memories. My only criticism I have is that their cooked rice (served in meal and their sushi) is not always consistent. Sometimes mushy and hard. I have also asked my Japanese colleagues and they agree that their cooked rice is not always consistent. The owner is quite a nice person and always has time for small chat while on his teppanyaki on the take out side. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"having lived on the west coast for 10 years and moving back to Brampton, a good sushi restaurant was hard to find. I think Toshi does a great job with their sushi, taste great, prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"What a surprising discovery! My husband and I stumbled upon this place yesterday and talk about a pleasant surprise! Admittedly we were a bit snobbish in our expectations as we've tried many great sushi places in the city and a random little place on Hwy #10 in north Brampton didn't seem like it would rock our world. But, the fish was so fresh, beautifully cut and inventive in its presentation that we were really taken aback. The only caveat, as Aaron points out, is that the service is sparse. They take your order, bring you the food and bring you the bill. God forbid you need a drink refill or extra tea because they're not cycling around to ensure you have what you need. This was a bit frustrating as it seemed that with this little fix we'd be pretty close to perfection. Now, I don't know if I'd say get in a car if you live downtown and head up here to try it out but, if you're in the area, it's worth finding this place for a delicious lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Worked here for almost a year.  I had to say that everyone was like a family! Even though I read a review (SOMEWHERE) about saying that Toshi (the boss) yells at his waitresses, I think people need to understand that he is the one on the grill everyday cooking them teriyaki's!!! There is only so much he can do for Take-out AND dine-in. Most of the people who worked there have been there for many years. I regret quitting but I had to :( after eating the japanese food & sushi here, I have high judgements when I go eat at other sushi places. :)"}
{"text":"I didn't order sushi when I went here. I got beef&chicken teriyaki, my friend got some sort of stir fried udon noodle with chicken teriyaki, and my other friend got chirashi sushi.  Nice clean atmosphere. The owner and my server were actually Japanese unlike most other Japanese restaurants are owned by either Chinese or Korean.  The food quality is excellent. The ingredients they use are very fresh, you could taste the different.   The food taste good, however I think the teriyaki tasted too \"homemade\", like if I make a chicken teriyaki at home, it would taste exactly like theirs. So it doesn't really feel like eating a restaurant food. Or maybe I just make a good chicken teriyaki..."}
{"text":"If you're ever in brampton and want to eat some really good authentic sushi, I recommend this place. It is a small family business owned by a Japanese family (which you don't see a lot), which I believe reflects a lot about their care, quality and presentation.  The salmon sashimi there is awesome, which is part of the reason I'm a big fan. Portions are moderate to large. They have a wide variety in sushi which you don't get to see a lot of at sushi buffets, including shrimp and octopus sashimi (both worth a try!). Service is moderate depending on which server you get."}
{"text":"This place used to be a 4 1/2 but slowly going down to a 3. The service is why it is now going down the drain. The service makes the experience less desirable. The food is still top notch but for the price we would expect that servers understand English and actually don't leave plates forever waiting to be served. Until they change 1 or 2 servers this place will not see my business."}
{"text":"I came here on Monday with two friends for a nice lunch. The atmosphere is quaint with a few patrons already eating and we were seated quickly. The server was extremely nice and was training a new girl so we had two servers. We ordered miso soup and edamame to start. Both were good but not exceptional. However, the star of the show was the sushi. We ordered the aburi Atlantic roll which was recommended by other reviewers. As someone previously mentioned, you only see the menu for aburi sushi at the front door and not on the menu that you receive at the table which is strange. It was absolutely delicious and I would recommend it. We also ordered the spicy salmon roll, the dragon roll and the California roll. The rolls were very fresh and well prepared. We also asked for a side order of spicy mayo which was delicious and actually spicy (unlike most places). The service was quick and our server refilled our drinks every 10 minutes. What stood out the most was that we finished eating and weren't quite done our conversation so my friends and I sat at the table for another 10 to 15 minutes.  We were not rushed out at all and our server still continued to refill our drinks even though we had not intention of ordering more food. Little touches like this make this joint special. I'll definitely be coming back here again."}
{"text":"Really good food! Fast service and very friendly waiters. I would recommend to anyone that loves Japanese food. For the portions and the food quality the price is cheap ."}
{"text":"Despite the raving Yelp reviews and a friend claiming this was the BEST sushi restaurant in the GTA, I was a skeptic coming here to set the record straight. I mean, 1) there is some pretty fierce competition in the GTA and 2) let's face it, it's north of B-town....  Well, it turns out that stereotype was wrong and I was the one in the dark the whole time. This place is truly a hidden gem. It is definitely authentic - it is Japanese owned/run and them speaking Engrish is good enough to verify that fact. The sashimi here is to die for - it is extremely fresh and has that natural sweet taste.  PLUS they have torched salmon/tuna rolls here. SAY WHUT. That reason alone makes the trek to Brampton worthwhile.   Highly recommend their specialty torched rolls. Tried the spicy mayo Aburi Pacific Roll (torched tuna roll with a touch of green onion) - um, need I say more? Melt-in-your-mouth refreshing goodness and lots of flavor!  Order SASHIMI! As much as your wallet/budget allows! Got their combo with 3 of every type of seasonal fish and loved EVERY.SINGLE.PIECE. Even the ones I usually dislike at AYCE or sashimi platters. Plus all the slices are jumbo sizes. Not just thick, but REALLY thick. Note that the sashimi combos (excluding bento) don't come with rice!  Ordered udon hotpot which was very, very good too.... so it's not just sushi! :)  The lunch deals seem like a fantastic steal. This place will probably be the only place I wish I lived in Brampton just so I could go for lunch. I was wrong about Brampton and Toshi has definitely topped my list as one of my favourites for REAL sashimi/sushi. Only thing is it's a tad more expensive.... will come back when my wallet has refilled."}
{"text":"Good food. Fast service. Menu ordering, if you are not hungry enough for AYCE places. Sushi tasted fresh with good texture."}
{"text":"nothing special here.  came here for lunch a few days ago - ordered the soft crab roll and I didn't really like it.  my friend got the box with chicken he said it was okay, nothing great."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend for her birthday on a weeknight.  Despite it being a Wednesday, Toshi's was busy.  Service was great and the server was attentive and polite.  I ordered the yaki udon with chicken (there is another one that includes both chicken and shrimp), but of course, they brought the one with the shrimp.  I politely mentioned that I asked for the one with the chicken only and the server replied that they both cone with shrimp, so it's probably best to ask for clarification before ordering.  They also apparently cook the udon in the same pan as the shrimp, so those with severe allergies--be sure to ask it be cooked in a new pan.  They promptly brought the correct meal and it was yummy!"}
{"text":"Great service and fresh sashimi! My friend and I were there tonight and shared the broiled mackerel dinner and the sashimi and sushi dinner. Delicious, fresh, and definitely nice cozy atmosphere. Authentic feel."}
{"text":"Very good place for sushi! Service was good and waiter was super nice! The price was also very decent and there were tons of varieties to pick from. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"It's always good when the servers are attentive. Really efficient service, even during busy dinner hours. Great entree options for picky eaters too. Always a pleasure to eat here:) highly recommend for business lunches too."}
{"text":"Always a wonderful experience! Their dinners are also pretty authentic! My friend is Japanese and she can't get enough of this place!  I recommend the jumbo dynamite roll with spicy mayo and the abruri sushi"}
{"text":"This place is beyond amazing! The quality of food is always the freshest in Brampton in terms of restaurant quality sushi and meals. Love going here for special occasions especially and the staff is super friendly!"}
{"text":"Love the salad and soup. My wife loves the broccoli salad.  Sushi quality is pretty good. Service is great.  Gets pretty busy in the evenings and on weekends, but they still manage. Not expensive at all and portions are decent."}
{"text":"I wouldn't call myself a sushi expert or snob...but I'm from the Vancouver area so that will affect my standards. I've gone a couple times and glad that the reviews have done the place justice. 4 stars seems a bit low, but the Yakisoba was just okay. But the main thing is the sushi and that really deserves 5 stars (in light of its price range). They're clean, fresh, properly treated and cut. They actually have a very large menu as well, so you're bound to find whatever you're looking for. I look forward to trying their Ramyun next time."}
{"text":"Amongst other reviews by Yelp-ers, indeed Yoshi is a hidden gem in Brampton. Portion sizes are huge, especially there Sashimi and Sushi. I've eaten at quite a lot of Japanese restaurants and I must say, this is in the top 3.   Food is very authentic, even the ice cream is imported from Japan. It is definitely worth every penny! Be sure to try their Toshi Specials, they are to die for. Especially the lightly flame seared salmon sushi! Exquisite!"}
{"text":"best sushi spot in Brampton . Food is delicious, fresh and authentic Japanese. Polite friendly service"}
{"text":"Amazing quality sushi and spectacular sashimi. Best quality Japanese restaurant in Brampton. Nice thick cuts of fish. Well worth  the visit when in Brampton."}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic Japanese but not a questionable AYCE experience, this is the place to go. Now I don't eat sushi or shellfish - so I'm not reviewing that. But man. The rest of their menu is amazing, mouth wateringly good. Their teriyaki dinner are HUGE and you could split them easily. Gyoza and Edamame were perfect. Average prices for a nicer place, the decor is perfect and so was the service. Can't wait to go back ."}
{"text":"My go to sushi hang. Great ramen, nice beer and soju selection. Simple and authentic. Love the grilled mackerel."}
{"text":"Of the gems in Brampton! We go here to crush our sushi cravings when we can't get away from the city...their a la carte sushi is reasonably priced and well worth a try. It is the few Japanese owned sushi in the gta. Their must haves include their salmon skin rolls and other specialty rolls. I wouldn't recommend their entrees just because it is on the pricier side. The chicken teriyaki can be a bit bland and dried. I do suggest checking out their Japanese desserts selections as well. I will be coming back when I get the sushi cravings on those lazy days."}
{"text":"I know the owner personally as he is a customer of mine...not to be biased, I got to know him after eating his fantastic cuisine... I'm not a sushi guy, but the sushi is fresh and the people that eat it say it is great. The teriyaki is awesome, if you go by the take out area the owner is the actual cook, who is almost always there as he runs a tight ship and takes pride in his work. Nevertheless, the take out prices are so cheap, made to order right before your eyes, the place doesnt have all the pizzaz of some restaurants, but the quality of food and the prices are awesome....give it a try... trust me you'll be sold..."}
{"text":"For years I have been coming to Toshi and just realized that I have never reviewed.  I have never eaten inside the restaurant as I have always ordered from the take out side.  I have ordered the same thing every time I've come for the past few years lol.  All though they are well known for their amazing sushi they also have a HUGE demand for their teriyaki take out.  You are best to call ahead and its always buys no matter what time of day.  Be prepared to wait if you are walking in and ordering.  I usually order the beef teriyaki which come with the beef, veggies, white rice and a whole lot of teriyaki sauce smothering both the meat and the rice.  Over the past little while I have been substituting the veggies for some extra rice for no extra charge as that's what I prefer.  The large portion is huge and a very generous and filling portion.  The combination is incredible you will not be disappointed.  Toshi will always be one of my favorite for take out."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed. I have been trying to get to this place for years after hearing so many great things. I go and have the worst sushi I likely have ever had.  I ordered a grilled calamari with teriyaki sauce appetizer. The calamari was rubbery and tasteless and the sauce was some gooey, salty substance.  The sushi rolls I ordered were not presentable at all and were practically falling apart in my plate. I expect a little more presentation with a la carte sushi (especially at this price point) but  Toshi was worse than any AYCE place I've been to.  The service was also not overly friendly and I had to call her down just to get water. And then she brought me one but didn't bother to take that as an opportunity to see how everyone else was doing with their drinks and food. No check-in to see how things are at any point, nothing.  At the end, there seemed to be no included dessert, even for the people who ordered full dinners, Bento boxes, etc. This seems a little odd since just about every place I've ever been to offers a small scoop of green tea ice cream at the end. What would that cost them? And after I've paid $32 for my meal?  I'm glad I went here just so I finally know where it stands in the talk about Brampton sushi. This place doesn't even deserve to be talked about in the same category as Sushi House."}
{"text":"Toshi's is NOT all you can eat, however they're fresh and ever so tasty. By the time you've selected all your rolls, you're at the price of all u can eat anyways, just with better quality. One of my all time fave sushi places to go. :)"}
{"text":"I really like this place. It's a very small and quaint storefront hidden between many other places in the area.  I think what I really enjoyed was the bento boxes. However, I only gave them four stars primarily because the pricing was just a tad bit high.  My bento box however, was pretty good considering it had been my first time eating at such an establishment. I really liked the glass noodles and the beef followed by the sushi that was hand picked by the chef. I also enjoyed the ramune beverages, they are pretty fun!  I will definitely have to come back for their cheesecakes which I have been hearing are pretty amazing too."}
{"text":"Great, great place for either dine-in or take-out. More famous for take-out but dine-in is even better.  Last time there, went with a party of four, we ordered:  - 1 shrimp tempura - 1 hiyashi wakame salad - 1 avocado handroll - 1 dynamite handroll - shrimp teriyaki x 2 (one no rice; both served with salad and miso) - chasumen (served with salad) - hot tea  It was as good as it always is! Toshi always uses the freshest ingredients, orders always comes out quickly, and the maki is always nicely displayed. They are known for their teriyaki but it's worth it to branch out from that and try the rest of the menu.  Oh, one more thing: I've been to a lot of Japanese restaurants, and this is the only one where I've had homemade miso soup. (!)"}
{"text":"Thought this was a good Japanese restaurant to eat at! The staff was friendly and the food was pretty good. I got the katsu don and though it was good, thought it needed just a bit more flavour. The sushi was good too. Would come back again."}
{"text":"Had the party tray A. This place is very good, very fresh for the area. I drove for 20 minutes to get here. Since I went in the noonish time, I got my food quick. We also had the udon with shrimp and jumbo dynamite roll. A bit pricey but worth it. Greasy and tasty."}
{"text":"Had a bad experience here a while ago with a take order of California Rolls that were significantly off. Haven't been back for that reason but in fairness I've heard very good things from other people who've never had an issue. For me, too many other places to go to bother trying again."}
{"text":"My first time here today. Sashimi cravings got me here. I've been driving past here too many times that today, I just had to stop. I sure am glad I did. The staff is very friendly and attentive and the food is very awesome. I've seen a few dishes walk by my table to other guests and I know I've got to come back and try some. As far as the sashimi goes, I've had the lunch sashimi plate and it was phenomenal. I could recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"The sushi from this place was bomb!!! Probably the best I've had, I ordered the dynamite roll and California roll  so tasty!! The service here was really nice too. Super quick. All in all 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"Read the review of Toshi, and felt it was worth the drive to try out.   I ordered the Dragon Roll - eel  and asked them to make a roll that wasn't on the menu.  I call it a Spicy Tempura - Shrimp Tempura with Spicy Tuna.  It confused them dramatically! But after they said it would cost $3 more, they made it.  Both rolls came out great, fresh, and presentable.   Ran out of Wassabi & Ginger.  I had to wait till I got my bill to get my first refill on my water.   Nice, clean place. All the dishes I saw coming out to the other tables looked great. Everyone looked very pleased with their meals.  Very pleasent wait staff."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Brampton IMO.  Actually Japanese family owned and operated which is incredibly rare these days  Solid teriyaki dishes as well.  Try the yakiniku marinated beef, jumbo dynamite rolls, yakisoba.  All of our take out orders always consist of at least one of each of these before other addons.   Affordable take out  Minus one star for a few reasons, but one annoyance is how they hold onto the good Japanese soy sauce packets like it's their balls. Even when asking for extra soy, beware as they give the cheap Chinese soy packets (clear packs) instead of the sushi soy (silver pack).  Then to go even a step further, even when specifically asking for extra silver pack soy they STILL only will give one more ..  Also no AYCE"}
{"text":"Very impressed with this place.  Especially for where it is located Prices are reasonable, the portions are huge I ordered the Teriyaki beef and chicken, and got this super mammoth beast of a plate for 14.00's. My friend's sushi was made very well.  Yes all you can eat is great, but sometimes you sacrifice quality.  Not this place  I just don't get the TV in the dining room...if you are having a TV, at least show the raptors game :)"}
{"text":"This is one of my quick reviews. There is not much to say except you get what you pay for. Not in a bad way here. The pricing is right where it needs to be. Very reasonable pricing. The flavours of the soups is very good. I can tell it has been prepared with care. The service is good. Things that get me is when you order tea and it doesn't get topped up. But they do pay attention to you here and make sure you are happy. I usually get a big soup or a bento box. They are all very good. The only issue I have is with the seats. They are not comfortable. But most places do this so you get tired and don't sit there too long. I would eat there more often if the decor and seating was better. But it's a good hearty quick lunch for me."}
{"text":"Delicious sushi and miso ramen noodles. The seafood is always fresh, a must try is their scallop sashimi. The servers are friendly and attentive. The atmosphere is warm and always a buzz with conversation. A must try in Brampton and a great way to support a local family business."}
{"text":"They've got the tastiest and most generously-sized teriyaki rice dishes. They have a separate area for takeout which is convenient but what I'm not a fan of is how limited their takeout menu is in comparison to their in-dining. I really wanted ramen and their green tea cheesecake but, alas, it's not in their takeout menu so unfortunately I couldn't order it. I really wish they would accommodate and merge the menus -- I'm certain it would be a smart decision for their business and there isn't any Ramen places at all in Brampton.  Aside from that, I always grab the chicken and beef teriyaki for my family or chicken and shrimp with a added broccoli. Their teriyaki sauce is so good!  Small tempura and their house Salad is a must too. I wish they added avocado to their regular dynamite rolls like they usually have in all other Restaurants."}
{"text":"I give this place a two-star, one up 520 but still not recommended.  The only thing I liked during my lunch was my Salad, which says a lot. I got the sushi and sashimi lunch combo and the boyfriend got a bento box. We both agreed the Miso soup was really salty and the food was not as fresh.  When it came to portions, quality and its price, it is definitely overly priced.  The servers were great, I'd give their service a B+.  The restaurant is a tad dirty, there's dusts by the wall divider we were seated, we spotted chewed gun along the walls, our table was not cleaned properly, sticky feeling."}
{"text":"When you're trying to make a decision about which Japanese restaurant you want to dine at but you're indecisive? Pick TOSHI!   Went here on a dinner date with my fiancé to celebrate the start of a relaxing vacation and we were very happy by the end of it. The ambiance of this restaurant is a family friendly yet can be an intimate setting. The server gave us a large 6 seater table for just the two of us which was odd but I don't mind the extra elbow room and privacy.  We went here on a Friday Night and it wasn't busy at all.  We ordered the Ebi Fry Curry, fried shrimp with curry and rice for 12.95. This is really worth the try and money! The portion can feed two people or one if your really starving! The curry sauce is very flavourful and you can tell they've cooked the pork or beef(couldn't tell, but didn't mind) low and slow. It came with big chunks of carrots and potatoes which is very traditional in a Japanese curry. Tip: they will give you a glass of cold water with your curry. Dip your spoon in the cold water first and then use the cold spoon to eat your curry. The cold spoon feels good on the palate as it cools the hot curry down and it helps the rice and sauce to not clump up on the spoon. How do I know? I watched a whole documentary on Japanese curry eating etiquette and the history behind it. Yup! Loved every single minute of it! It's also traditional to eat your Japanese curry dish with a raw egg.  Next, we ordered the Spider and Dynamite roll Combo! My two favourite in one. What can say? It's amazing! The soft shell crab or shrimp tempura to rice ratio is unbelievable! More meat to rice...duh! Just the way everyone likes it! They're both CRISPY af!  Lastly, my fiancé ordered the premium Nigiri Combo! This dish is very reminiscent of Japan's sushi presentation. The large sashimi on top of rice is great and filing! The colourful plate of the different Nigiri is a work of art. Not to mention it came with sea urchin... oh It's premium alright!   I would DEFINITELY come back to this place!"}
{"text":"Good service and great food. A bit pricey compared to other places but as usual you usually get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I come here with my family all the time as my moms side of the family is Japanese and I can definitely say that this place is authentic as it gets!"}
{"text":"Looking at the reviews for Sushi places in Brampton, I really find it difficult to believe that 'all you can eat' places can get higher ratings than Toshi. Personally that is not possible.  The fish here is top quality and fresh - not chemically treated like the a-y-c-e places. Service is fast, friendly and efficient. And in the end, unless someone has a gynomous appetite, the price isn't that much higher than at an a-y-c-e.  That is what I come here for (please pardon me for ending with a preposition)."}
{"text":"Food is always great and service is excellent. Sushi master is a true master. Our go-to place for excellent Japanese."}
{"text":"It's rare to find a japanese-owned and operated restaurant and it was great to finally try it. I've always heard of Toshi but never got around to trying it as every time we craved sushi, we would usually go to a local restaurant or AYCE, rather than venture out for a la carte.   I ordered the premium nigiri combo while my fiancé ordered the ebi fry curry and a spider roll to share. The premium nigiri combo came with 15 pieces of premium sushi. The fish was very fresh and they give you very large cuts per piece. The salmon and red tuna were my favorites in particular. My fiancé loved the ebi fry curry as they give a lot of pieces of deep fried shrimp, smothered in Japanese curry sauce. The sauce was very flavourful and had small pieces of meat along with soft potatoes and carrots. The spider roll was good as well, large pieces of soft shell crab that were delicious and fried perfectly. We probably shouldn't have ordered the roll as the entree servings were plentiful so we ended up consuming a lot of rice. The service was quick and attentive, although we noticed there was only one server for the entire restaurant. Nonetheless, can't wait until our next visit to try what else is on their menu."}
{"text":"I was working around the area and was craving some sushi. I read really good reviews about this place so I decided to give it a try. I got a large order of chicken teriyaki and a spicy salmon roll. The spicy salmon roll was good but I can't really say the same for the teriyaki. The chicken teriyaki didn't really have any taste to it. I had to add hot sauce to it otherwise I wouldn't have been able to finish it. It was also quite pricey (I believe it was $18 in total).   I went again another time and ordered the futo-cali combo which was average. But again, it was pretty expensive for a sushi place.   I'll give this place 3 stars. Food is average, expensive. To be honest, it wasn't really worth the money that I spent."}
{"text":"Actually this is a 4.5 star ...missing half star for a full 5 because they don't offer fresh oysters or beef sashimi/tataki. Why is that??? Is that the norm for sushi restaurants in the Peel Region because it's illegal or something??  Anyway, I really liked the service. The servers are so very polite and pleasant. They check on you every 10 - 15 minutes. The sashimi is fresh and the cooked stuff is pretty good too!! The portions are really quite large for the price. We didn't try any special rolls though. I would definitely go back when the sushi craving hits me. :)  Oh, and good for kiddies too!! They have kid's meals that include a salad and icecream!"}
{"text":"I used to come here all of the time when I was in highschool, that was seven years ago. I recently returned and was so disappointed. This place is pricey, the food used to be good but it was just not worth it this time around. The kicker for me though were the three hairs that I found in my salad, my soup and my tofu teriyaki entree. This was so gross that I told the waitress that I was leaving, won't be finishing dinner and wont be paying for the food. She was understanding and I did not have to pay, I also did not want to eat anything for the rest of the night.  Yuck. I will never return."}
{"text":"Great Japanese place in Brampton. Love their chicken teriyaki and sushi. Always gotten take out never sat in."}
{"text":"Toshi is quite a blessing. It really is. It is the only Japanese owned sushi and yoshoku restaurant in Brampton. When you think of it and given that there is no other authentic restaurant in Mississauga, Georgetown, Caledon or Vaughan either, it makes Toshi a gem.  With that said, there were problems with the food today.  Toshi's specialty is aburisushi (blowtorched sushi). I had the hotate (scallops) which comes as two pieces and Pacific (which is tuna) roll. The fish was good and was slightly seared. Aburisushi is rare so theirs is appreciated. Strangely, the aburi is not on the menu. It is only advertised on a sheet of paper at the entrance.  We ordered the saba battera and the waitress returned to inform us that they were missing a key ingredient, konbu, which is the thin slice of seaweed that covers it. We persisted and it was good, but clearly missing the konbu of course. The nigiri sushi itself good, but not very good. Frankly, the rice (Shaari) was too hard. The sushi rice needs to be softer. All in all then, a few missed today, but still they have a wide and authentic offering and are still above average for sushi.  I just think they can do better and should be better. On the other hand, given the area and demands of the customer base Toshi may have been swayed by the pull of clientele who wants inauthentic items like Vulcano roll or spicy this and spicy that. Who knows?  The owner is Japanese, but the waitress and second chef were speaking to each other in Chinese.  Finally, they have created a nice atmosphere with Japanese decorations, lanterns, boys and girls' festival dolls and zodiac figurines. Nice job which lends itself to an authentic setting, but too bad that they have a TV hanging from the roof, which is never a good sign for food. The washrooms were clean which is important and a good sign."}
{"text":"Japanese owned/operated.  Probably the most authentic in Peel!  I was gonna say GTA-west, but I've never been to Kaji which is supposed to be amazing...but $$$$.  Although my usual joint is good, I get bored of it 'cause the menu/music is always the same.  No surprises, no daily specials.  So this is where Toshi comes in.  As soon as you walk in, specials are posted.  You can also ask waitress for them if you do not want to walk to the front door.  The specials definitely entice you to try more/order something that you wouldn't normally order.  I've tried their nigiris, makis, various rolls, and a ramen.  Food is solid.  Presentation could be better, but it's still pretty good.  Plus, it's heckuva lot cheaper than my usual joint as well, BONUS!  Here are the reasons for the - star: -  I don't think they play any background.  So the crowd - especially if half the restaurant is full of Japanese people drinkin'/eatin' in celebration - could get loud -  depending on where you're seated, you could have a better experience!  There are a coupla randomly placed tables of 2 near the door.  Not the optimal setting for a nice dinner -  servers are ALWAYS apologising for something, re:  speed, not having soy dishes, being busy, etc.  Could be endearing/bordering on annoying. -  if you go on the weekend, it IS busy.  Food doesn't roll out the fastest, so just be prepared for that.  Do not go there starving!  Tip:  If you're planning to go on a weekend, make a reservation to ensure a decent table."}
{"text":"This restaurant would generally get a very good review from me, but their last screw up was significant.   As a patron who orders chicken teriyaki (one of their most popular take out dishes) I should not have to open their take out carton to ensure that the 4 main elements of the dish (chicken, rice, veggies, and sauce) are all present.  It goes without saying, unless I ask for a modification all of those items should be in my takeout box.    Long story short- I received my order, drove 15 minutes home and sat down at my dinner table only to find out that my chicken teriyaki had no sauce.   What is chicken teriyaki without sauce?  Well it ain't chicken teriyaki.  Didn't bother driving back to correct my order as I didn't have the time.    I will probably go back.  I've been going to them since their days at Shoppers World, but until I feel like I can order again without thoroughly checking my order, my low ranking remains."}
{"text":"We have been to Toshi several times now, always dining in. They were referred by friends who prefer the take-out option so we finally took the plunge (we prefer a night out). The food is always fresh, super hot, and delicious. Well priced, great service, meat is always so tender! We continue to return and try different items on each visit, and have yet to be disappointed. Very delicious food, cute interior, but try not to sit by the door."}
{"text":"I've been ordering the same thing for the last ten years. Double beef with shrimp, sauce on top with noodles. Big portions and great value. Five star take-out."}
{"text":"*Please keep in mind that I can no longer eat here because of a severe allergy to gluten, but before this I was a regular at Toshi's - Meaning, I know what I'm talking about;)*  This place ... What can I say. Amazing, authentic Japanese food. Their teriyaki sauce is INCREDIBLE. I swear, if I could I would drink the stuff.  The udon noodles ... The kappa sushi ... The tempura banana with ice-cream. Need I go on?  Personally I preferred take-out - the inside restaurant is very quaint and peaceful though if you're the dine-in type. The servings were a great size - I eat like a truck driver and I was usually full to bursting when I was done.   Prices are fair - not too expensive. Probably around $10 (or less) for a giant plate of food.  They're great with preferences - if you don't want onion/carrot/whatever in your stir-fry they have no issues with cooking without it. Food was always perfectly cooked and flavoured.  I miss this place and their sauce ever so much!"}
{"text":"I get take out only here.  Their Spider roll and Salmon roll are the best.  Tempura udon is really good too.  I dont like wasabi or ginger... when I request this upon placing my order... its a hit and miss.   I have ordered here 20+ times.  Only one time the rice was not cooked in the rollls.  When I called to complain, the owner could care less.  For that they lose a star ranking.  Otherwise it would be a 4.  Service is not good in the dining area... hence the take out only."}
{"text":"I've been here a while back in their take out section for a Maki party tray. I remembered the maki rolls being good then, but I've had better so I never really went back until recently.   My bf and I decided to stop by in the dine-in area. We were seated quickly and there were a few tables occupied for a Tuesday night which was a good sign.   I was craving udon & noticed that their yaki udon has chicken and shrimp in it... not a super fan of shrimp so I asked for a chicken yaki udon but still ended up getting shrimp too. Wasn't too upset because maybe I could've clarified better and tbh it looked delicious and the portion was huge! Sadly.. it looked better than it tasted. Well, I didn't even taste anything ... there was not enough flavour or seasoning it felt like I was eating udon with a light drizzle of water .. I was so sad because I'm a huge udon fan and given the ratings I expected a lot more.   My boyfriend got an udon hot pot dish (forgot what it's called)... the portion was so small compared to mine and it was the same price ($14). It wasn't that great either ... like the yaki udon the presentation was nice but the taste was lacking. It was like udon in asian herb broth .. I can't lmao   We also got two rolls... spicy salmon and I forgot the other one. They were good but smaller than most sushi places.   We tried their takoyaki which was good! $5 for 5 too so cant go wrong there. But the octopus they put in the centre is smaller than other restaurants.   Service was just average and typical. They'll seat you, take your order, drop off your food and take away your plates when you are done. Nothing above and beyond but nothing to complain about either.   Overall my experience was just ..meh... I'd only return for their maki trays but even then that's not going to be often."}
{"text":"I've ordered large sushi platters a dozen times since discovering this place about 10 months ago.  For GTA West, this place gives great value while still delivering tasty and quality sushi that is above par in the GTA West and GTA North.    Most places give you mediocre shari (sushi rice) that is either underseasoned, sloppy, or mushy in the sushi or maki rolls.  Not Toshi!  It's well suited in size where it doesn't overwhelm the sushi, it's nicely seasoned so it has a flavour profile (just the right amount of sweet and tart from the rice vinegar), and it's well cooked so it has a mild chew.  In the sushi platter and take out platters, you get a larger variety versus other restaurants.  You have items such as sweet scallops, true ebi (sweet raw shrimp) in addition to the cooked shrimp, large succulent pieces of eels that have the perfectly roasted crisp skin (and not drowning in brown cloying sauce), and a variety of fresh (not frozen) fish.  The sashimi pieces are always generous and worth every penny.  I really love the care and details taken into the presentation as well.  Everything is always well laid out with nice little decorative flourishes.   As for the restaurant, it's a nice open and clean zen like atmosphere that isn't too homey like other Japanese restaurants.  It's a bit more modern than most.  Service is quiet and unassuming but still very attentive.  I never have to ask for a refill on the green tea.   I think this is possibly one of the best Japanese restaurants in the Brampton/Mississauga/Oakville area.  I highly recommend you to try it out!"}
{"text":"Ordered the salmon teriyaki dinner (only have medium size) for take out it was surprisingly exceptionally good for $10. Skin on it was really tasty!    Yam Tempura rolls just ok... huge thick chunks of sweet potato just meh. Not consistent because I ordered two orders and the other roll was thin deep fried yam roll which was good!   Dont bother ordering spicy salmon roll its super tiny and minced with spicy mayo.... but the roll is teeny!"}
{"text":"Average tasting sushi. Good place to go if you are craving sushi but not die from all you can eat. I think I might've gone when I was TOO hungry and felt like I didn't get my money's worth.   I tried the aburi specials (blowtorched sushi) because this is the only other place I've heard of having aburi. Why are they at the front door only though?! Could not find it in the menu!! The pictures were when you walk in and when I ordered, it wasn't even in the menu for me to point at and of course there was miscommunication and I got the wrong thing. Still really wanted aburi though because All you can eat definitely does not have it - and the only other time I've tried blowtorched sushi was at a high-end, modern Japanese cuisine place. So there is a bit of a bias.  The fish is much fresher than your typical all you can eat (not frozen) but the flavour is overpowered if you choose to get it with wasabi mayo. I chose this option (between Japanese mayo and spicy mayo) because I wanted to taste the roll without overseasoning it myself with my own concoction of wasabi and soy sauce.   I ordered 4 things but got 3/4 right:  Pacific Aburi roll ($11 for 8? pieces) - it was pretty much tuna on top of an avocado roll with a little too much wasabi sauce and some scallions thinly chopped for garnish. My high expectations were disappointed. My own fault though.  Salmon sushi aburi ($5.75 for 2 pieces) - instead I got the salmon sashimi aburi ($6.75 for 3 pieces)because of miscommunication. The older lady who was serving us was extremely sweet and allowed us to keep it and didn't charge us. This was probably my favourite because I love my salmon medium rare. I wouldn't have ordered this in the first place though because I could've gotten an entire filet of salmon cooked like this for that price. But I got to give them credit where it's due. The sashimi slices were THICK. Still super tasty.  Hotate aburi (scallop) ($5.75 for 2 pieces) - never got this order. I'm pretty sure she forgot. But I thought I was already paying for the salmon sashimi so I didn't bother correcting her. She did however, end up bringing me the salmon sushi aburi ($5.75) I asked for. The salmon laid on top of the rice were thick and long pieces. Not sure if this was done because it would be blowtorched, but the pieces were impressive. Not what you'd see at all you can eat. Too much wasabi on this though. There was wasabi tucked in between the fish and she put wasabi mayo on top as well, not asking me if I wanted to try a different mayo on a separate dish.  Green tea cheesecake ($6) - got this to go. Wish I ate it when it was colder. But even at room temperature this was my absolute favourite! You can taste the matcha and the cheesecake was a great texture. Not too dense and not too fluffy (at room temp). For $6 a slice though, I really want an entire cake from Uncle Tetsu's.  My friend got the banana tempura and this is what I highly recommend! Fluffiest banana tempura I've ever had! It was delicious! Around $5-6 as well."}
{"text":"I was in the Brampton area and my daughters wanted Japanese! So of course I used my trusted Yelp app and came upon a high rated Toshi Japanese Restaurant. This is the cutest place. It's owned by a Japanese family. The decor was nice and they service was amazing. Whatever  ok need they're there to help and very friendly.  We had tempura to start with edamame. Our meals came with soup and salad. The kids ordered their kids teriyaki chicken dinner and the portions are huge. An adult can eat that meal for only $8!! It comes with soup, salad and ice cream. Amazing. I had the udon fried noodles with chicken. The food was delicious I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Not a fan.  Review was based in a single visit last summer...when I have not started to yelp.    After reading all these good reviews, I decided to give it a try.  I always like Japanese restaurants that are owned by Japanese....the quality is always better. But this is not the case here.....  Ordered kalbi dinner, an order of uni sushi, and a premium nigiri combo.  My complain is the rice is not seasoned well, and too much rice.  The rice is not the same type of short grain rice that I always have....The uni was ok fresh but that's it.  The premium nigiri set selection is so so, there was masago (I usually don't see masago gunkan in a 'premium set'), uni, ikura, a few pieces of tuna, salmon, hamachi, eel, tako, amaebi, tamago, etc.   The price is not cheap but not that expensive ($28.95 for the premium set).    For the Kalbi dish, the taste is ok despite they are not using one big piece of kalbi ('LA kalbi') but was those thin slices ones.    I won't return."}
{"text":"YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS PLACE!  I have been ordering from this restaurant for over a decade, and it's still my go-to! They are always so quick, and the food is always so phenomenal.   THEIR SAUCE IS TO DIE FOR! I can't rave enough about this sauce!   I always get take-out, so I don't know what their atmosphere is like in their restaurant, but I'm sure you won't be disappointed.  This place is fresh, delicious, and so quick. I always have their teriyaki - and their sizes/prices are perfect."}
{"text":"I've eaten sushi at a lot of places and this is one of the better restaurants I've tried. Google maps showed us nearby sushi places and we randomly chose this restaurant as we were not familiar with the area. Unfortunately, even though their door was open, the restaurant was closed until 5pm. They have nice, warm traditional decor and the bathrooms were clean. When we asked the lady if there were any other sushi places around, she answered \"not like this\". Some might call that cocky, but I gave them points for confidence! She mentioned the nearest AYCE place and then we stepped outside. While we sat in the car trying to decide what to do, we realised that they had a take-out counter next door. I have no idea why the woman in the restaurant wouldn't have suggested we just go order food from there, it's the same business. We ended up ordering some yam tempura and 2 Sushi A combos for $11.95 each, which were very decent for the price. The sushi was yummy and fresh. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone in the Brampton area."}
{"text":"I had sushi set. The fish was good and fresh. Miso soup was great. But the rice and wasabi was poor. The portion of fish on each sushi could be larger, it make better taste.  In brief, this is my second time having Japanese food in Canada. Will come back and try the hot plates.   Great services from lady"}
{"text":"I've ordered here a few times now, good service. The teriyaki dishes are a great and affordable item for the amount of food you get. It's a good balance of rice versus meat/veggies, unlike other places that over-pile the rice and give a small amount of meat. Personally, I'm not a fan of the sushi here, but they have a few good rolls. Overall, great take-out spot, where the food is cooked on the spot rather than sitting in a heated table."}
{"text":"Really really impressive :) .  My family and I ended up getting take out instead of sitting in the restaurant, but we were impressed nonetheless.  We were greeted by a lovely young lady who was extremely pleasant and helpful, and that was an amazing start to our dining experience.  Not 15 minutes after we placed our order, our food was done!  It was so delicious and impressive!  We ate and enjoyed our sushi so fast, I was not able to take pictures of our beautiful food!  I definitely recommend this restaurant, and I will definitely be returning to dine in next time :) .  Great place."}
{"text":"Looks can be deceiving.  Exterior mall and interior decor are not the greatest looking but worth the dine in.  Started with fresh garden salad, octopus deep fried balls with teriyaki sauce ( really good ), cold soba thin noodles in fish sauce ( will stay with hot next time as I'm not a fan of their cold broth) and large tempura ( shrimp is really nice with light batter).   Main entrees were ramen with pork tenderloin in a savory hot broth and bento box with sushi ( very filling and well portioned).  Great friendly service. Will be back."}
{"text":"Good sushi...  Nice decor....  What you would expect from a sushi place.   We also enjoyed some nice Saporo beer.  Yum.    We ordered the Sushi and Sashimi combo.  It seemed a little small when the plate was put down, but I was right stuffed by the time I left, so was satisfied.    The customer service was actually fantastic.  They are so nice at this place!  Really A+ on customer service.   I found them a little on the pricey side, but that's all.  When in Brampton, I would return to Toshi Sushi!    Recommended."}
