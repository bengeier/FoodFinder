{"text":"Pricey but worth it as a special treat now and then. The veggie paninis my friend and I got (she got beet, I got mushroom) were wonderful as was my lime-lemonade. Wish we would've known about the patio before we were on our way out, especially as the inside cafe area is extremely small."}
{"text":"Happened upon this cute coffee shop one afternoon and had the best smoothie I have ever tasted. I chose the pineapple, mango, banana smoothie and it was absolutely heavenly. The owner made the drink himself and informed me it was an all fruit smoothie no high fructose corn syrup involved. Which only made me more excited to try it. As promised it was fantastic and I loved the vibe the shop had with the art displayed on the walls. Will definitely be going back soon."}
{"text":"Great little coffee shop with yummy sandwiches and good coffee."}
{"text":"they're terrible. especially the guy who works there! i'm not sure if he's the owner or not. but he's racist!  
if you go there, it will take lots of time to get your coffee because he's gonna spend too much time for gigging with all the \"girls\"! 
and he's very mean to Asians! 
I cannot believe that this kind of place exist! they should close the business!"}
{"text":"Peanut butter brownies here are the best in all of the land. Everything bagels with tomatoes are also delicious. Coffee: Very good. Collection of The Sun Magazines available to peruse while waiting for said delicious food and beverages: Very, very good. Unfortunately, their bagels are usually sold out by noon and the food is SUBSTANTIALLY overpriced! A cup of soup is $5; adding tomatoes is $.60! Yikes."}
{"text":"The first thing that struck me about Make Your Mark is the lack of a front door.  I went to the glass facade and was confused for a second until I figured out the door is on the side.  Walking inside, it feels like you're entering someone's home rather than a coffee shop or cafe.

The guy working at the counter was very friendly and without a doubt a genuine person who knows what he's talking about and wants to please his customers.  They also seem to have a good mix of regulars coming and going, as friendly conversations were struck up the whole time I was there.  They have a good selection of different drinks and they were priced well.

I particularly liked the great photography on the walls.  The varied pictures give a unique feeling to the inside and each one grabs your eye in a different way.  Someone said it before, the music selection is great.  I heard things from Van Morrison, to jazz to modern artists and they all fit the vibe of Make Your Mark.

I already feel like I may up my rating once I go back a few more times, which I definitely will.  I have more drinks and food to try, as well as experience the nice back patio.  Looking forward to my next visit there."}
{"text":"This morning I thought I'd see if the grass was really greener at another coffee shop. I usually visit Commonplace in Squirrel Hill (which is THE BEST), but it was a gorgeous morning, I wanted to sit outside with my one-year-old son, and I wanted to try something new, so off to Make Your Mark we went. I had been there once before and had had a bad experience because I was stuck sitting next to a table of professors who were bashing their current undergraduate class, but I'll never give up on a place because of other customers. 

Today, upon entering, the woman behind the counter looked at us briefly and then quickly looked away--no hello, no good morning, nothing--but whatever, I don't need that to \"make\" my coffee shop experience. I scanned the menu for a cortado to no avail, so I asked if I could have a macchiato please. She turned quickly and said, also very quickly, \"A macchiato is espresso topped with milk foam, you have to choose how many shots of espresso...\" I said \"Yes, I'd like a double, please.\" And as she turned to the espresso maker, she either said, \"This isn't a Starbucks,\" or \"You should go to a Starbucks.\" Either way her tone made her comment clear. 

I know what a macchiato is, and I've never once ordered one from a Starbucks (not that I even find anything horribly wrong with Starbucks!) But my mom taught me to kill 'em with kindness, and I want to teach my son not to be rude, so as she handed me my double macchiato, I said \"Thank you very much!\" and paid with cash, leaving a generous tip even by stellar service standards. 

But here's a tip: how about you get some customer service? Even mediocre service is better than what they're serving. I'll never return, and I'm going to make it my business to make sure they don't get any business from any of my friends or family. I've never been so disappointed or had my day so thoroughly colored by bad customer service. But, I thought, let's at least go enjoy the outdoor patio. 

As I headed outside, someone came in and was greeted with \"Good morning! Will it be an iced coffee or a latte today?\" Clearly, you have to be a regular to matter as a human being here. So, outside I chose a secluded seat and settled in with my son. Only then did I notice someone's bag on a chair at the table next to mine. Oh well, I thought, there's no harm in sitting next to someone at a cafe. Apparently I was wrong. 

When the owner returned he sat for 10 seconds and then got up and switched tables. When his friend returned, she said, \"Oh, we're moving?\" \"Yeah, it's sunnier over here. Mumble mumble mumble.\" Needless to say, it wasn't sunnier at their new table far away from us. Guess what they started talking about? That's right, this years' students. Let me make sure that I say I have no problems with profs. I have an MFA and plan to teach, and some of my good friends are profs. But this was just too much coincidence not to mention.

So, if you're a professor or if you've been visiting this shop every day for decades or if you're just a pretentious snit, then THIS IS THE SHOP FOR YOU. Otherwise, stay as far, far away as you possibly can--lest you risk the elitist arrogance rubbing off on you. (The macchiato wasn't even that good, but maybe the bitter taste in my mouth came from something else.)"}
{"text":"It was our first time there for a quick light breakfast and it was a good experience. Coffee was great, nutella pound cake and bagel with cream cheese were good!
People there are seem really nice."}
{"text":"This is the best coffee shop in the city.  I wish I could get over here more often, but the only negative thing about this place is that their hours don't mesh well with my free time (I wish they were open a little later on weekdays and on Sundays).  

The decor in Make Your Mark is inviting, and they have a lot of local art.  Coffee is obviously delicious, but the food is just as good.  The attitudes of the staff are laid back and friendly."}
{"text":"I am a regular at Make Your Mark due laregly in part to their great quality of food and beverage. When combined with a stellar atmosphere and friendly service this coffee house is irresistable. 
To eat, I would recommend the casadilla. Made with a wheat tortilla, gooey cheese, beans, and sweet potatoes! Served with chips and fresh salsa. Yum. They have a fair selection of fresh healthy foods that go well with any beverage selection. I enjoy most the outdoor seating when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"Such a great, little coffee shop!

Tucked away in Point Breeze, it might be easy to miss this place if you are not looking. But the coffee is fair trade, the workers are super nice, and there are papers on the wall which come from patrons who are encouraged to draw!

Come by and check it out....."}
{"text":"I can't believe that I am the first to write about this for Yelp!  Make Your Mark is just on of the few recent businesses to the Point Breeze Business District.  Just a mile from Shadyside, this district is all local.
I am going to say that this may be the best coffee shop in town.
1. its local
2. great interior decor and lighting
3. good, good food. Usually cafe in Pittsburgh food is blah, blah.

I think I am even overhearing that they are expanding their seating are to include a quite study area - which explains why there is some hammering today.  But yeah for quite areas.

I really hope that Make Your Mark helps to raise the bar of other local coffee shops."}
{"text":"As good as it gets.  Great selection of coffee that can be ground fresh and french pressed for the best coffee experience possible.

Nothing to complain about here.  Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I had a bowl of their granola that I believe they make themselves. And they give you a choice as to what they will serve it to you with! Heaven. Of course being the lactard that I am, I chose soy milk. 

This is indeed a lovely little place in a lovely neighbourhood(Point Breeze)."}
{"text":"Make Your Mark Cafe and Artspace is a true oasis in Pittsburgh. Not only is the inside comfortable, beautiful and hip but there is a garden out back that feels like you have left the city and landed in the perfect spot.

The home made food is great, too, especially for vegetarians.  I've never eaten something I don't like there.

Last week, on a warm spring day, I had an iced chai and it was fabulous!! Go get one. NOW!

You can hang out here alone or with people.  You can work at your laptop or read a book.  

Best of all is that Hemi and Amy sponsor artists like myself.  They have art hanging on their walls, for display and for sale.  They do an amazing job of welcoming artists and making the experience work seamlessly.

Pittsburgh is full of cafes, and some of them are really great. Make Your Mark is absolutely one of the best."}
{"text":"I had a blackberry vanilla italian soda and the hummus plate which came with an ample amount of bright/lemony hummus, two types of homemade crotons (which were pleasantly salty), fresh tomatoes, celery, cucumbers, and red peppers. Perfect.

Clean, Comfortable, and a nice amount of light in the store. Spent an hour or two drawing a picture of a mountain. Guy at the counter was very friendly and helpful -- he even sharpened the colored pencils for us."}
{"text":"What a cute coffee shop! Make Your Mark is located in the heart of Point Breeze, which feels almost like a small town, not apart of a large city.

Anyways, the atmosphere of Make Your Mark is very cozy and inviting. It is the perfect spot to sit down for a few hours and get some work done on your laptop! The bench seating around the perimeter of the shop is very comfortable and there is a decent amount of seating inside and outside.

The barista was very friendly and didn't mind me staying for a few hours and getting a few refills. As for the actual coffee, I didn't think the quality was anything to write home about. However, the food was fantastic. I had the Nutella pound cake, which was, with anything containing Nutella, delicious!

While the coffee there is decent, what you should really come for is the delightful atmosphere of the shop and the yummy pastries!"}
{"text":"My latte was great, the patio was adorable, the mugs were even very cool.  No complaints."}
{"text":"I'm on the fence about Make Your Mark. I usually have good coffee and the small lunch plates are good, but the staff isn't overly friendly. I live just down the street, but I don't visit all that often because the atmosphere comes off as cold."}
{"text":"Let's get this out of the way right now: they have the best mocha in Pittsburgh. I know, I know! You think the best mocha in Pittsburgh is housed at any other location, but have you ever been to Make Your Mark? It's such a treasured nook that not many make their way over to Reynolds to check it out. 

The interior is very cozy and nurtures several \"working from a coffee shop\" types, while during the warmer times of year you can have fun in their backyard patio area. 

Also, their food is tasty!"}
{"text":"I hesitate to review this place at all, because it seems to be a little under the radar, and the venue isn't large. I like that about it, and I LOVE this place to go and work but Yelp isn't about being selfish, it is about sharing what is awesome (usually) so here it is. 

This is officially among my favorite coffee shops in the city. There are a few that I love (Tazzo D'Oro in Highland Park is a can't miss) but Make Your Mark has the perfect vibe. I love going here to write, or work creatively on projects. It is also a great place to get small coffeeshop food. Soups and sandwiches are tasty tasty tasty. 

There are HUGE windows in the front of the space that look out onto Reynolds street, a gorgeous little slice of this cute little neighborhood nestled into the middle of the East End. 

My only complaint about this place is that it closes daily at 5pm. I have closed this place down multiple times, and it always seems odd. It basically means I can only come here on a Saturday, or if i take a day off from the office. If they had longer hours I'd be really happy to come here after work on days when I don't have much going on, but alas, I cannot. 

Definitely try this place if you have the time. Great for to-go drinks too!"}
{"text":"Great spot in Point Breeze!

Coffee quality is very good. I got a latte today, and it is really tasty. It doesn't have a syrupy taste to it like some lattes do.

I LOVE their food. It's all vegetarian, but as a meat eater, I find it completely satisfying. The MYM Panini is a good choice - tomato, mozzarella, etc... hard to go wrong! The couscous is my favorite side dish. It has a bit of a curry taste to it, which I quite enjoy. They typically also have a special or two every day, which they post on a board daily.

The inside is quite small, although they have a really nice and spacious patio in the back. You can do takeout or eat-in with your food. Typically food comes out quite fast."}
{"text":"Very nice small coffee shop. I stopped by here just for a regular coffee, but it was a very rich and robust French Roast. Their 12 oz coffee is only $1.65, a very reasonable price. They have all the different types of coffee drinks you could want, and I really love French Press coffee, which they also offer here. 

There's a small area right near the front window with tables and chairs. It's a little tight and don't expect much privacy with your conversation. It's nice to sit there and look out at the quaint street scene in this part of a Pittsburgh. 

I didn't get any free WiFi network from this store show up on my iPhone."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place to hang-out and be productive in town.  I like everything about this place.  The neighborhood in which it is located is so cozy.  The actual coffee shop itself is quite nice as well, and quiet!  This is huge for me.  The service is friendly.  The food is fantastic.  The hot-chocolate is the best I've had since I've moved here.  Free wi-fi, and nice spacious windows to look out to the street when you're looking for a little break/distraction from your work.  What more could you really ask for?  And like others, I am a bit hesitant to hype this place since it is so awesome."}
{"text":"I love that all of the coffee here is fair trade and organic! This is a friendly neighborhood coffee shop which is often filled with families and lots of little kids. They also serve some breakfast type foods including bagels and cereal as well as somewhat fancier lunches. I've had better cappuccinos elsewhere, but they're acceptable here. Unfortunately, the WiFi is rather hit and miss -- sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't, but at least it's free."}
{"text":"Thoughtfully prepared food and coffee made by socially conscious people. An eclectic mix of patrons. Can't help but feel good after dropping in!!"}
{"text":"Best coffee shop in pittsburgh by far. I'm lucky enough to live a block away, but if i didn't i'd go out of my way to come here every morning. 

The owners are super nice, the atmosphere is cozy, and the pastries are delicious. I won't drink an iced coffee from anywhere else. And the back patio is super cute. Glad to have a place like this in point breeze!"}
{"text":"We moved to this nabe about 15 months ago, and my husband has probably gone to Make Your Mark almost every single day since then. It's the perfect neighborhood coffee place!. The coffee is amazing, and the veggie menu has some really great options. Their iced coffee is also superb. It's a great family run business and the owner is quite sweet! Also there is a beautiful back patio to hang out in - perfect for our late Saturday morning visits. 

Thanks for being awesome, MYM! :)"}
{"text":"Great vegetarian-friendly food! The beet wrap was outstanding. Lunch is always a pleasure.

Fine weather has me out on the back patio, admiring the cherry blossoms and downing yet another magnificent panini or quesadilla or wrap-thing. Keep it up, MYM!"}
{"text":"This coffee shop is completely adorable, and I am heartbroken that I will be leaving it soon when we just met!  The primary reason it is a five star place is the outdoor garden patio.  This is the cutest patio at a coffee shop, and I could sit in the garden all day.

On my trip I ordered an iced coffee ($2.35) and a peanut butter brownie ($2.60).  Iced coffee seems like it should be so easy, but so many places use gross bitter coffee to make it.  I was shocked when I did not need to alter it in any way.  The iced coffee was good and pretty cheap.  The peanut butter brownie wasn't very good and too sugary. This is mostly a personal taste thing, though. I was disappointed to see that there were no desserts without nuts because I don't love them in my desserts nor any vegan dessert options.  I would skip the desserts and stick to coffee.

The workers are not very friendly and actually kind of rude, but they get the job done."}
{"text":"I love everything from the enchanting patio to the great lunch specials (best veg sandwiches in town and fantastic homemade soups) to the employees' conversations about Lady Gaga and the concept of art space meets cafe. I only wish Make Your Mark was open and serving up awesome foods and attitudes all of the time, or at least later into the evening."}
{"text":"I've been to Make Your Mark a couple hundred times, but then I live two blocks away.  I love the place. Their coffee is among the best of any coffee shop in Pgh (ask Hemi to make you a dirty americano) -- second only to La Prima on the Strip probably.  Their mint brownies are incredible.  Their everything bagels are to die for.  And the hidden gem is their lunch menu.  Make Your Mark is the perfect place for a Saturday lunch.  They have some of the best vegetarian food in Pittsburgh, and definitely the best food of any Pgh cafe.Make Your Mark is the most sophisticated cafe in the city, without a doubt.  

It's a good place to study too.  They have free wireless and the lighting is really good."}
{"text":"Dream-haunting vegetarian Ruben sandwich(slaw, grilled zuchinni, thousand island), and great coffee. Wish they were open later/served food later. Need to get here in the summer and check out the patio. Also a bit expensive for the food(sandwiches run about $7-8)"}
{"text":"i was fortunate to come across make your mark after moving to pittsburgh for school. i wanted to find a coffeeshop that with the right atmosphere of not too loud but not to strictly tense, and of course, great coffee.
make your mark fits all my expectations for the ideal coffeeshop. the workers are super friendly and the manager particularly is always a pleasure to have an extensive chat with!
i love how their coffees are all organic and roasted fresh very recent to your visit. they also have delicious pastries that a personal baker makes for the cafe. i love this cafe, and even go out of my way to come here :)"}
{"text":"Cute little coffee shop! I ordered an iced soy chai, and it was very good! I had to mix it first, but it was so milky and sweet. The coffee is pretty strong. I initially could not find out how to get into the coffee shop until a man from Pino's next door told me I had to go around to the side. I also had forgotten where the door was when I left! Oops!

The barista was very friendly and strangely confident which was actually nice. There is a monthly featured artist that hangs their art. There is also a bit of food, but I have yet to try it."}
{"text":"The coffee here is incredible, but my biggest complaint is that their posted hours of buisness are a joke. It says they are open until 5 p.m., but there have been many times when I show up at 4-4:30 and they're already closed. My biggest word of advice to potential customers is, stick to this place as a morning spot only. If its afternoon go elsewhere, they aren't worth the trip considering how inconsistent their hours are."}
{"text":"I don't get why this place has high reviews.  Could not finish our espressos.   Which we base most reviews for coffee shops on.  Waited 15-20 minutes for it, not high quality.  Tasted like a bitter strong coffee.  Look elseware.  Good place for kids though to play or make crafts."}
{"text":"Best tabouli salad I've had in years.  As good as anything in NYC or Israel...not surprising since the extraordinarily nice, friendly, and gregarious owner is Israeli."}
{"text":"This place is very loud and the staff are not friendly.  The food is ok and the drinks are pretty plain."}
{"text":"As an update, I can't even count on the coffee being consistently good. A few in our party had bitter and just dirty tasting java. We brought it back and the girl said that sometimes happens. What? They then cleaned the machine. I think they just need to be diligent about cleaning the machine and the spout should be wiped every time. Please don't rest on it being the only java shop in the hood. Let's serve everyone like you want them to come back. We don't want to lose you yet. :)"}
{"text":"Most people live in the get your coffee quick, express gas station breakfast, and Italian coffee size caffeine jolt for their morning fix. But is that really coffee, let alone enjoyable?

We forget that we should expect more from our coffee. I demand quality from the things I enjoy the most and why should coffee be any different?

For those looking for an artisanal coffee experience where the beans are ground fresh, each cup is French pressed, and baristas who are more interested in hearing your life experiences than rushing you from the line...then you have found the spot.

The decor itself is a bit spartan and not the most comfortable for Sunday lounging. I've only tried a few items on menu and everything that I've tried thus far has been great. Try the salad with the lemon dressing- it's DELICIOUS.

Simply put, Make Your Mark is a hug in a cup."}
{"text":"Found this place by accident last year, and have gone here at least once a week every week since then. It's the kind of coffee shop gem you dream of. Not to mention the food--especially for vegetarians like me--is fantastic. Every day there are new specials that are house-made and always vegetarian or vegan. The coffee is fantastic and the sweet tooth selections aren't any less stellar. 

If the veggie rueben is on the board: GET IT! The side salads always have healthy delicious dressings. 
 
The soups and chili change week to week, and are honestly just plain impressive. 

Be aware: It's all house-made and this stuff sells out. It's a very busy place for a really good reason.

Care and attention goes into the coffee, which beans they buy, how the espresso is made. The americano is one of my favorites in the city. 

The atmosphere is welcoming, bright, and filled with art and pictures from kids. The back patio is open and lovely during in-seasons. 

Can't recommend a better spot to sit down for a cup of coffee and some awesome food."}
{"text":"Living in Point Breeze there are not many options for coffee in the neighborhood. Shadyside is right next door but nonetheless, it is nice to have something right here. 
Make Your Mark, as other reviewers have indicated, is a great place to be productive. The atmosphere is friendly and quiet and the large window provides some shimmer of light even on dreary days.Not to mention looking down the block gives rest to eyes that have been glued to a computer screen for hours. 
The seating is comfortable and the coffee is wonderful. I don't know that there are any more considerations for coffee shops as this one hits all the notes!"}
{"text":"I came to Make Your Mark when I visited the Point Breeze neighborhood for the first time, and I think I'm going to have to frequent Point Breeze more often, even if it's just to go here.

The service here is super friendly.  A lot of the customers seemed to be regulars, but as a first-timer, I felt just as welcomed.  The man at the counter (possibly the owner?) was pleasant and quick to make drink and food recommendations.  When I ordered the yogurt & granola special with fruit, he told me that they were out of one of the fruits but immediately offered substitutions he could make.  

In addition to the usual coffeehouse baked goods (which looked delicious), the place also has an all-vegetarian lunch menu, which includes wraps, soup, and hummus plates.  Unfortunately I was there a bit too early for the lunch dishes (they start serving lunch at 11:30), but enjoyed my generous helping of granola, yogurt and fruit.  

The indoor seating area is bright and clean, and the outdoor seating area is also really nice.  I didn't doodle a picture for the magnetic boards, but there's always next time."}
{"text":"This places gets it done, with coffee and food.  Staff is attentive, and the patio is beautiful.  Their hummus wrap is super yummy.  There's a woman at the counter on weekday mornings who wears a T. Rex t-shirt and speedily dispatches both food and coffee orders by herself.  And they appear to be very kid-friendly, though I've never seen any kids first-hand.  It's an wonderful asset to the neighborhood -- but don't tell anyone else, because I don't want to lose my seat."}
{"text":"Make Your Mark, hands down, has the best Chai Latte I've ever sipped! The owner really cares about quality and people. The entire staff is super friendly. Free wifi for all! Truly outstanding!"}
{"text":"It's true! Make Your Mark is as adorable and comfortable as other reviewers report. It's a shame that it's taken me so long to get here!

We loved the outdoor patio/garden in back. It's an oasis of beauty and calm. It doesn't have power, but it does have free WiFi.

We didn't get the opportunity to try the food, but everything looked and smelled delicious. I can't wait to get back and dig into some of their offerings!

The service was exemplary -- all the staff seemed happy to be there and interested in providing their  customers with a positive experience. MYM does seem to have little clique of regulars, but they didn't monopolize the staff or the furniture. Based on my experiences here so far, I may join their ranks..."}
{"text":"My latte was yummy. I asked them to use the coconut creamer and it was delicious! Hummus and crostini was a filling snack and surprisingly went well with the latte. Back patio is like stepping into an undiscovered treasure! Outdoors is good for a quiet read. Indoors, depends on if there's kids or not. But they have free wifi!"}
{"text":"Super rude douchey foreign dude at counter made both me and my boyfriend feel very uncomfortable and unwelcome.  BF had several tattoos, one on neck, one on hand but was the sweetest guy ever.  Sorry douchey foreign dude if he didn't \"look\" good enough to drink your coffee.  It's for sure he won't be back and I can't imagine I ever would.

P.S. Boyfriend passed away, douchey guy still living, as far as I know.  No justice."}
{"text":"If you're looking for the most comfortable and welcoming cafe/coffee shop in the world, please look no further!  

There are so many great things going on here!  First off the environment is just so warm and inviting.  From what I hear the weekends are pretty hectic, but the weekday was nice and calm for a nice work day and meeting for me!  You really can't get any friendlier than the owner of this place either.  I could have BSed with him the whole time if I didn't have work to do!  Plus, you can really tell he cares about his business and how he wants to present it...I love that!  I even chatted with some other costumers, it was just that kind of friendly environment! 

I also love that I can grab a delicious, all vegetarian I might add, meal.  But don't worry, it's not shipped in, it's cooked fresh.  I enjoyed the broccoli and white bean soup and a mushroom, red pepper and cheese panini.  Both were delicious.  I loved how the soup had large pieces of fresh broccoli and it wasn't bean overkill either.  The mushroom panini came on rye bread, which I usually don't like, but for some reason this magical rye bread did the trick on all the other amazing flavors from the veggies.  I didn't think of meat for a second!  

I'm definitely going to make this a spot to hit up when I want to grab a bite and work...and maybe chat up some strangers!"}
