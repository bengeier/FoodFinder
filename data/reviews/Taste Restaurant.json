{"text":"Mmm Mmm Mmm!!   Great location, atmosphere, knowledgeable staff and in the end every little morsel of food was gobbled up and plates licked clean haha.  The 3 people who joined me had the same reaction and we all said we would go back any time!   Thank you for an intimate, delightful dining experience!"}
{"text":"delicious food, delicious wine, outstanding service!  Laid back atmosphere inside.  awesome menu that changes monthly...same with the wines.  definitely a favorite of ours.  great for a night out with afew friends.  Get there early...it's cozy!"}
{"text":"Went here for a late dinner and stayed until they closed.    This is a good place for sharing small plates, my favourite way to eat out.  We sampled several over the course of a few hours, but none of what we had is on today's menu!  When they say the menu changes often, they mean it.  The food and wine were excellent and I look forward to coming back to try out the ever changing options."}
{"text":"I love Taste for the simple reason that I get to try EVERYTHING. Which is obviously the point.  I'm 'that girl.' You know, that one that pours over every menu, changes her mind at least five times, then blurts something out randomly when the server comes to take the order. 'That girl' immediately experience diner's remorse and then proceeds to negotiate a bite of all of the dishes at the table. Not irritating at all.  So Taste is a good spot for me. Some of my favourites:  - Duck fat popcorn. Sounds disgusting, but OH. EM. GEE. It's like crack, without the obviously health and social implications.  - Gnocchi. I will devour anything associated with truffles. This is no different.  - Mac'n'cheese. I have spent the last two years perfecting a mac'n'cheese recipe, so I will say decisively (and without bias, obviously) that isn't as good as mine. But still worth the trip.  - Pork chop. If you've read my review for Boxwood, you will understand my devotion to pork as a meat medium.   - Beef vindaloo. Nom nom nom.  I also really like the beef tartare, which I'm kind of picky about. The only thing I've had there that didn't float my boat was the fish tasting board. Turns out that I don't like cold fish. It's a texture thing. I'm sure a seafood fan would love it.  Food aside, I love the atmosphere. Small and intimate, where the love of good food and good wine abounds. It's my kind of place."}
{"text":"Wow my taste buds are blown away! This place is awesome. There is limited seating but gives a more intimate setting. But definitely a bit on the hipster side. The staff was very friendly upon our arrival.  We started off with the pretzel bitz which come with their homemade mustard. A nice surprise to taste some horseradish in there so tasty!!  We then shared the Mac 'n cheese and the beef dip. I've never had a more scrumptious beef dip then the one at taste. I highly recommend it to everyone. The Mac 'n cheese was also mouth-watering with a generous amount if bread crumbs on top and a very creamy cheese sauce.   Just go your taste buds will thank you!"}
{"text":"Recent trips to this restaurant have updated my rating in a positive way. New wait staff makes for a more pleasant experience. You no longer need to be a hipster for good service! Food is very very good (not unbelievable but good for the price). Great intimate atmosphere."}
{"text":"All I have to say is the best things come in small packages. I didn't realize that it would be \"hole-in-the-wall\" small atmosphere but it was so cozy we sat at the bar and the staff did great job of giving is the low down of how how to choose plates and wine. I give props to the cook because the Beef Vindaloo was my favorite and tasted just like my mom's. Holy cow amazing. Great experience."}
{"text":"This place has a great intimate vibe, awesome wine pairings and great staff. Good for business or personal, would recommend to anyone. In summer the patio fills up, great spot to sit.   Still sad that the gnocchi isn't available for lunch anymore!"}
{"text":"Have been wanting to try this place for awhile. Went with my cousin and a friend on a Saturday night. We ordered a cheese board, mushroom risotto, a meat dish  and a salad. The cheese were fantastic, but it is expected, meat dish and salad were good but not memorable, the risotto is terrible and tastes like microwaved. A well cooked risotto should have the texture of al dente, this risotto was obviously prepared already and just heated it up.  Everything is in tiny portion, except the price!"}
{"text":"This is a fabulous tapas bar close to my place. I would probably rate it higher, but unfortunately since I do not eat any meat except chicken and turkey, the availability of options on the menu is limited and so after going there a few times, I don't really have much of a variety to choose from.  Do not get me wrong - I think their food is great, but I like trying new things. Three items that I really love are the artichoke dip, beet salad and the macaroni & cheese. I might just be obsessed with beets and truffle oil which is why I love the those three so much. I like how small and quaint the restaurant is. I often sit at the sharing tables and hope that I would get someone interesting to sit next to, but its never happened. Instead I have just been enjoying the company of my friends.  I also really love their wine list. The servers always have a recommendation and the price isn't too steep (I am no connoisseur, just comparing to other restaurants I have been too)  I had dessert here only once, it was delicious. They had a trio of creme caramels and it was just yummy! I will have to do dessert again next time!  I would recommend Taste if you want some fresh food and a neat atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great spot to meet up with a girlfriend or for a date night! Just enjoyed three delicious dishes - including the chicken in waffle, tomato salad and artichoke dip, each with a unique spin! Can't wait to head back to try some more dishes and recommend Taste to friends!"}
{"text":"Taste of amazingness. Yes this place is worth the hype. Duck fat popcorn is all I have to say. Good food, good wine. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been to Taste 3 times now (lunch only) and have enjoyed it every time. The menu is small but inventive, and the wine list is also well done. The wine list gives the opportunity to try wines that aren't usually found on most city wine lists. Very much enjoyed that. The mac and cheese is excellent, as are the sandwiches. Good location, simple but nice decor and good service. I'm fairly fussy and Taste didn't disappoint. Looking forward to trying them for dinner."}
{"text":"We were there for Valentine's Day so we had a limited tasting menu. That said, the food was delicious and creatively presented.  We lived the atmosphere and had a view of the small kitchen...which for me always adds a little fun.  The only critique is that the ventilation is inadequate to remove the build up of cooking odors.  We will go back."}
{"text":"Went to taste on a whim with boyfriend. There was only ourselves and 2 other customers in the restaurant. All the suites and stilettos must have wandered back to their offices as it was past 1.  We went inside, its a cute little restaurant, far smaller then i imagined. Our server was nice and very attentive. The menu was simple and easy to read and understand.   He ordered the chicken pesto sandwich with a side of salad, and i ordered the mac and cheese. The food was great. The only  thing that needs a bit of tweaking is the seasoning on the macaroni. I get that the breadcrumbs were possibly seasoned,  but the sauce lacked some seasoning.  He said the chicken pesto was fine although there should have been more chicken.    We will return to taste with some friends however to try \" the big bangkowski\".. it looks like its going to be a fun time and hopefully i can change my review to 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I frequent this place, so I've long been a fan but most recently I went with my mother most dear to enjoy their Big Taste dinner. Naturally, we ordered one of each. She had never been, so seeing someone new to Taste (and somewhat new to more trendy, different flavours and presenations) enjoy it so much added to the experience for me. She was initially skeptical of the foie gras and pork liver tart but happily ate half!  Their wine list is always top notch and the courses were perfectly portioned and delivered at a perfect pace."}
{"text":"Back again this year and things haven't changed. I think they have just got better. We had some fantastic dishes, including popcorn with duck toppings, some great fish platters which included Ceviche, smoked salmon and more. The service was also great - funny, entertaining and most importantly informative. Hopefully I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Hands down, one of my favourite restaurants in town . . . and I've only been there for lunch!  The food is consistently creative and delicious. I work nearby and am happy to have such convenient access to fabulous food at a very reasonable price. One of my comfort food-y favourites is a lunchtime mac&cheese, with either soup or salad. Perfect!  The service has always been quick, attentive and friendly. No complaints at all - and I'm a big stickler for customer service!  I've gone with co-workers and also have had friends meet me there for lunch, and everyone is always impressed. I look forward to further exploring the lunch menu, and I can't wait to make this an evening destination! I'm sure I'll only fall more in love with it . . . ."}
{"text":"Taste does a \"whatever we can find left in the restaurant\" $30 three-course blind menu on Tuesdays. This pandered well to my food-adventure side, so I went for it.   Throughout the courses I was simultaneously delighted and disappointed.  I was impressed at the complexity of the dishes considering the chef had thrown them together that day with what they had in the kitchen. I appreciate the economics of this idea. (It's fun for the people AND we can get rid of all the heirloom tomatoes that were over ordered!).  Throughout the courses it was a bit obvious that they had to get rid of both tomatoes and beef so the overall meal lacked contrast and was very heavy. I would have appreciated a vegetable or salad course to cut the heaviness of the meal.  The dishes were good, but they were not the same level of good between each other. Had I ordered the cabbage rolls without getting a Jamaican patty, I would have never thought the cabbage rolls were a bit on the plain/gristly side in comparison to the bold and playful flavors of the patty; I also wouldn't have noticed that the cabbage roll was a bit out of place overall next to the patty and the star of the show, the bacon-wrapped burger on the homemade pretzel bun.  The burger was as interesting as it was delicious and the buns were so good several of us asked if we could take a dozen home. It was unfortunate that the previous two courses were so heavy because, try as I might, I could not finished my burger.  Although the three course dinner needs a bit of a polish I did like Taste; the service was attentive, it's intimate and small (my favorite kind of restaurant), the food is good, and the Tuesday night blind menu does makes Taste an interesting spot for a weekday date-night or friends-night-out.  T."}
{"text":"Have had their mac n cheese for lunch a few times and just tried their daily soup, that was tomato based and creamy and their grilled cheese sandwich was so good too.   Also, their Trio dessert is to die for,  creme brulee trio, jalapeno brulee ?? yes please, I will take it anytime.   VERY conveniently located across the street from me... :) so I will keep trying new things for sure!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and great service.  I ordered two dishes and they were both excellent.  The mac n cheese is the best!  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Excellent food service was fast. We were the only people in the restaurant. Any of the hashes were amazing and my kids loved the waffles. Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Really an excellent offering of culinary craft. I had a number of really great small plates, all of them were delightful. If you cannot find something you like here you don't eat real food (period).  The Pig ears and Quail egg was a great twist on the old staple, scallops were cooked to perfection, all 5 of my dishes were excellent for sure."}
{"text":"Last night was my birthday so I got to choose any restaurant I wanted.  I've heard such good things about Taste that it was first on my list.  We arrived early-ish (around 6) because they don't take reservations.  Unfortunately there were no tables free when we arrived but a nice couple made room for us at one of the communal tables.  I love tapas because you can try lots of different things in one meal.  We had Christmas in a Tube (sausage), scallops, pork chop, edamame, pork belly but the stellar standout of the evening was the gnocchi with truffles and wild mushrooms.  Honestly gnocchi is not one of my favorite pastas because it can often be heavy and dense.  This gnocchi were pillows of pasta goodness.  YUM!    The service was stellar throughout the meal and it couldn't have been better.  We finished off dinner with the creme brulee trio.  My husband really loved that they had a specialty bourbon on their menu since very few restaurants in Calgary feature bourbon.    I can't wait to return to this lovely restaurant!"}
{"text":"Wandered over to Taste after seeing some great reviews. Was greeted at the door by Brendan, big, tall Brendan. LOL Had the Duck Fat Popcorn, Wow. A small bowl of French Onion Soup and the Spicy Italian Sandwich. The Sandwich was absolutely outstanding. Had a couple of beers, nice and cold and the service was excellent. I left fully satisfied and completely delighted. The great news is I live 2 blocks away. Will return often."}
{"text":"I have been waiting for the opportunity to go and to try Taste but always either had some other plan come up or the idea of not being able to make reservations made me want to go elsewhere that I could secure a table.  Well, after work one cold Monday we decided to go for an early dinner and I must say I was very pleased!! I absolutely love tapa style meals, it is my favorite - you get to try a numerous different flavors and items and can never get bored of a dish since they are usually smaller. Taste's menu did not disappoint with this aspect!   When we arrived we were the only couple inside and it was nice, very quaint space. Our main server was very attentive and always knew when to come over and top off our water and replenish our drinks.   We ordered the featured cheeseboard, elk carpaccio and the beet salad. All was very fresh, and delicious. I also found that the portions were a perfect size, we didn't feel overly full or still hungry.  Our server was well-informed about the wine they serve; I probed about wine qualities that I like and he was able to suggest to me exactly which ones I wanted.   I was delighted with our time here and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is my ideal weekday lunch destination.  the decor is design-savvy, down to details like somewhere to put/hang your purse regardless of where you sit.  the menu concept is simple and appealing.  the dishes are enjoyable and well proportioned.  whereas pub food will leave you sleepy and dreading returning to work in the afternoon, a soup and sandwich at taste are just right.  the service is quick and i'm usually able to finish up lunch without worrying about being back to work late.  i'm a big fan of the tomato soup and grilled cheese combo (with a touch of blue cheese).  the 'cherry' - you bill is always accompanied by a homemade miniature cupcake - different each time.  these can also be purchased by the dozen, and unlike most cupcakes i come across they aren't too sweet, and there's not an absurd excess of icing.  i'd really like to go back for after work drinks - it seems like a nice spot for that as well.  highly recommend!"}
{"text":"You have to respect a restaurant that has this much dedication to its craft. This place just has passion! Staff is well educated on the menu and take ample time helping you select a wine pairing. The menu provides a plethora of food choices categorized by price point. The wine list changes monthly if I can remember correctly and is presented with clever descriptions of the flavor/origin. Contemporary decor, soft lighthing, and excellent food play into this whimsical hang out. Love it."}
{"text":"I went for a late night drink and appys recently. They had just regained power following the flood and I wanted to support :) They had a fun drink special called the Floody McNenshi with pieces of hickory floating in it - very cool! For appys we had the pretzel bites (good, but not as good as Annie's or theatre pretzels :/ ) and a truffle artichoke dip (comes with bread, meh... ). I was expecting great food and it was just ok."}
{"text":"Loved it.   We walked in on Saturday night and noticed it was tiny and there was a line.  While we waited for the host we quickly reviewed the other restaurants in the area, certain we would be turned away.  Within moments, the host rearranged the entire restaurant and had us seated at the bar with a promise to be moved to a table as soon as possible. Not only were they true to their word and had us at a great table at the window within 20 minutes, they stopped by to let us know that they would be putting a group of young girls at the table behind us immediately and the nice table they had saved for us would be ready momentarily.  Not really necessary but a great touch, it avoid those few moments of stewing about why someone else got seated first.  We were not as thrilled with the wine menu as we hoped. The bartender was very knowledgeable and helpful but the wines didn't really wow us.  I am sure it does someone but since I am pretty sure there is lots of wine in the building I am not sure it would kill them to expand the wine menu.      The food was amazing we had 8 different tapas and they were all excellent.  In fact, we had two servings of the Tar tare.  The service continued to be terrific all night long.  Most of the desserts were great but we did couldn't finish the bacon creme brulee.  Even so, it is great to have the option to try new and interesting food.    Unlike some of the other reviews we didn't find it as thrifty a choice as others for our group of 4 we spent about $250.00 + tip."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, great service, terrific company and a wonderful cause! 6 of us got together at Taste tonight for the Yelp Eats of Hunger Relief event. (Nov 4 -10) There is not much fanfare on the outside to let you know you are AT Taste but let me tell you, people KNOW where this place is! It was packed by the time we left at 930pm, not a seat left in the place. It is dim, small in size and very intimate. There is a shared washroom that is kept immaculate. The space itself is modern, not too loud with a great vibe going on from the people, the kitchen. You can see everything that goes on, the kitchen is small and does not have everything a typical kitchen has, but they make it work. Shawn, you worked some magic tonight! Taste is my kind of place - they serve tapas, small plates of food for sharing. Man, what didn't I try? The Mac and Cheese was to die for (thanks Maria!) We ordered the prawn tacos, perogies, chicken masala drumsticks and the meatballs. O M G. All were incredible. Wendy let me try her cheesecake in a mason jar. Geez, I need to start letting go a bit and order dessert now and then. No beer on tap for Manuel but he found a Dead Frog (yes, you heard it here!) beer that he liked as well as a blonde, both bottled. I had a couple of Rieslings and a strawberry champagne concoction wine. Bill our server was busy as heck with all his tables but he took great care of us and had a nice sense of humour. Our conversation flowed at the table and I love nothing more than to nosh with other foodies who truly enjoy trying new things. Thanks to Shawn who gave us a wee one bite dessert as we were finishing up. I was impressed with the prices not to mention how we snagged parking right out front on the street. Chalking this up to a great evening. We helped feed some of Calgary's hungry as our receipt of over $30 prompts Taste to donate $10 to the less fortunate. As always, thanks Wendy for all you do, you were on your game tonight and we loved this venue. I am starting to get sappy and crazy complimentary so I better just shut up and go to bed! Thanks Taste!"}
{"text":"Excellent.  Meat Tasting Board...5 stars.  Quality cuts of cured beef tenderloin (forget the name) and chorizo.  The mustard sauce is light and smooth...I'm not a big mustard fan so I enjoyed the lighter taste.  The liver pate was also quite light and airy...I prefer a heavier pate but others will certainly enjoy this spread.  Mushroom tart...5 stars.  The menu was recently updated, so I'm not sure if this was the exact name of the dish.  Regardless, it was excellent.  The pie crust was light and didn't overwhelm the mushroom filling.  The taste of the mushrooms was evident in every bite.  Small slices of mushroom added texture to the smooth filling.  Definitely a must try if you enjoy eating mushrooms.  Linguini Carbonara...5 stars.  The linguini was lightly covered in a thick egg and parmesan sauce.  The pancetta was finely chopped but you could taste it in every bite.  Excellent!  The peas were more of an afterthought but who cares, the pancetta is the star of the dish.   Short ribs...5 stars.  The short ribs were fork tender. I would've prefered a bit more seasoning on the protein but it was still very good! The fruit chutney was amazing; light but flavorful.  Mini cupcakes...5 stars.  Really good cupcakes!  For being so tiny, they did an excellent job maintaining the moisture in the cake.  They use a heavier cake mix which is fitting for this size cupcake (had it been regular size, it wouldn't have been as enjoyable).  The icing was sweet and loaded with flavor.  Looking forward to trying the rest of the menu.  I'm just sorry I missed the bone marrow and pork belly! :("}
{"text":"Delicious, delicious, delicious. We thoroughly enjoyed eight different items (Quinoa Salad, Scallops, Gnocchi, Beef Tartare, Artichoke Dip, Lamp Chops, and Tacos) and each one was exquisite. A dozen roses to the Chefs.  Service was wonderful from all staff.  Servers help each other out so smoothly and treat all customers so special.  Ambiance was perfect. Music was vibrant without being too loud. No need to shout to chat with your dinner partners.  Did I mention the modern minimalist decor? Clean, simple, upscale. Cool (as us older folks say.)  Enjoy the surprise at the end of your meal :)  There was not one aspect any of the four of us would change about Taste. Well done to the owner(s), manager(s) and staff."}
{"text":"I wanted to update this review, as I was here again for lunch (I know I go often) and the service was simply outstanding. As per usual I was with some co-workers, these ones were from the States and wanted a nice lunch, so I suggested Taste.   They were able to accommodate our group of 4, right noon as well, which was awesome. I had tried to gather the herd before this time, but it still worked out.   Sadly the soup of the day wasn't gluten free, but I did find out their french onion soup is, and the one guy I was with has a gluten intolerance as well, so they even went the extra mile to make him a little gluten free biscuit for the soup.   We did the creme brulee trio for dessert, and it was amazing! They had chocolate, vanilla and strawberry and surprisingly enough, chocolate was my fave. As well, just the perfect end to a great meal, they generally bring some sort of baked good with the receipt, today was a cupcake with a pumpkin cream cheese icing and our server was kind enough to cut 2 strawberries and put the icing on for me and the other GF fellow. Which was so nice!   I will continue to eat here, probably lots, as it's close and well it's epic."}
{"text":"On occasion Taste Calgary randomly holds Taco or no Taco night. I first heard this on my FB feed when I saw couple of friends talking about it. THanks Shannon and Maria H!  I looked forward to this pop taquiera the moment I laid eyes on their obscure but enticing website. Dear Calgary restaurants, do you wanna draw me into your mystery event without having me question your prices, location, and availability? Post a picture of a luchador in your background.  Taco or no Taco Lucha or no...scrap that MORE Lucha?  We stumbled around downtown YYC wait for the hour to hit 4pm. The señorita grumped about how no one eats dinner at 4pm, but I insisted \"SILENCIO! I must have these tacos\"  They were worth it...sort of...  I have the tendency to be over excited about everything but out of the three tacos I had: Brisket, Veal, and Seafood, well it was about a 2 out of 3 stars. Their Brisket and Veal were succulent and packed with flavour. I read up on Taste's tweets and those babies were worth cooking for hours. THe shrimp head however wasn't what I thought it would be like. The seafood fixins were delicious but I struggled to eat the shrimp head. Maybe it was meant to have been fried to crispy oblivion but I sat there chewing the shells for a long time :S.  But I say that with love. I can't wait for Taco or no taco to come again. Because everything else was amazing. Their margaritas were spot on refreshing and the señorita was buzzed...err...pleased. And their churros, good lord I've never had anything that delicious.  I'm sure I'll visit Taste again. I often hear it from the mouths of reputable people who know a lot about food, but very little about luchadors. But that's just how life rolls the dice."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant with a fantastic and delicious menu. Would go back again but they don't take AMEX and as such will only go there myself. If they took AMEX I'd be there all the time."}
{"text":"I had a lunch meeting in downtown Calgary and this little eatery is the one my client chose.  Good choice!   It is a small space for great intimate conversations.  I wouldn't recommend many more than 6 people in your party.   The lunch menu is fantastic with a selection of soups, salads, sandwiches and some hot meals as well.  They have daily specials, which I highly recommend.  I don't recall what my sandwich was called, but it had in-house cured meat and it was super delicious.  My lunch companions were kicking themselves for not ordering the same thing.   They do have dessert offerings, but all of us were too full to indulge.  Instead of mints or chocolates with your bill, you are presented with a mini-cupcake which was also phenomenal.    Now I can't wait until my next trip to Calgary so I can go back and visit again!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to take friends when they came to Calgary! Such a quant restaurant with intimate seating. You are able to see the whole kitchen in action as they prepare your delicious dish. My favourites are the beet gnocchi and blueberry perogies for dessert! These dishes are tapas style to its great to share at least 3 among 2 people."}
{"text":"love this place. such a cute date night type of place or even a nice dinner with friends just to catch up. its fairly small on the inside, but they do have outdoor seating as well, as long as the weather permits. the decor is very rustic with piney wood lining the walls and very natural looking rocks/sand/plant centerpieces for the tables with an open kitchen.    food:  - tasting board - fish - everything was amazing. smoked mackerel, tuna tartar with strawberries, and shrimp cocktail served with pickled shallots. we devoured this!  - pork buttons - pork ribs seasoned with lemongrass. loved this dish. watch out for the bones though. we didnt realize there were bones until we bite into it.  - chorizo meatballs - the sauce is amazing, and the bread they serve with it is so toasty on the outside and soft on the inside  - perogies - served with sausage gravy. soo yummie! i couldnt stop eating these. the potato filling was so soft and light and the gravy added the right flavor to round it out.  - green beans - surprisingly super delish. cooked with asian flavors - garlic, sweet soy sauce, and sesame seeds. it wouldve been the same way that i wouldve prepared them had i been eating at home.  - fish cakes - this was my least favorite of all the things that we ordered. the cakes were a bit flakey and fell apart to easily and the mango chipotle chutney that was served with it had a slightly ketchup taste to it, which was very strange.  - fiasco gelato - coffee cardamon served with a waffle cone and wine infused cherry. the gelato was amazing, as it most fiasco gelatos!   they dont have a very long wine list, but they have a very nice selection of wines from around the world. fell in love with their red wine from portugal so we just kept ordering that. they also have a lot of different cocktails that sounded delicious,  but i wasnt in the liquor mood.   overall, great experience. they also brought out the check with vanilla cupcakes with espresso frosting which was also really good. lovely meal with a good variety of flavors!! total was $120 including tip for 2 people and totally worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Excellent beet salad with pecans and goat cheese and micro greens  Had the lunch special risotto , wild boar and cranberrys YUM  Hard to find but worth the search, find the arts hotel and it is around the corner"}
{"text":"We were at a charity BBQ near by and could have done with with another dog each but supplies were dwindling and crowds were getting tenser and we decided to make a break for it and head to Taste near by as i've heard from some other elites that it's small bites and very good.  Given that we had eaten but were still hungry,  small plates was rather ideal I thought.   Our table ordered:  white bean dip warm olives mango salad rolls pork belly   (I didn't eat) seared scallops   (i didn't eat) blueberry perogies coconut panacotta  As a vegetarian, I skipped two and it seems there were the table's highlights.  Which leaves me - not sure what I thought.   the mango salad rolls were a let down - I didn't taste the mango at all and they were falling apart.  2 rolls cost $10.   I got 3 rolls for $5.75 from my work's convienience store and I think I like them better.   White bean dip was delicious and I loved the panbread toasties.   This was my favorite of the meal.  warm olives were OK and not bad for $5 but it was a lot of olives to sit there and eat.  I don't think I'd fancy that again without a larger group.   The panacotta was good and I'm not a fan of coconut or pineapple so that's impressive.   The blueberry perogies were kind of like turnovers that taco time offered at one point.  They were good but reminded me of fast food and thus cost too much.    Overall I was a bit disappointed for my share of the $120 bill but I seemed to be the only one of our three. Considering I went from kinda still hungry after eating to satisfied but not stuffed... I'm really not super happy about the cost to taste and satisfaction factor.  Although I'd visit taste again for another go,  only one of my dishes was something i'd reorder."}
{"text":"Probably the least known and most under rated restaurant in Calgary. My sister lives nearby, so after enough drives by I decided to give it a try one time. Maybe I'm bias because the first time I went there was on my first date with the special lady who I will eventually marry, but regardless, the food is phenomenal. The atmosphere is perfect. It's a place that's upscale, yet I feel completely comfortable going to while casually dressed. Service has always been wonderful and helpful. \"A little funky, a little fresh\", are the words the server used to describe the wine which we eventually ordered.   Everything is local and in house and yadda yadda, a little funky, a little fresh.   I've limited myself to only dining here a limited number of times per month and per year, in an effort to broaden my horizons. Otherwise I'd just eat here everyday because it's perfect."}
{"text":"I was so impressed with visiting Taste last week; I decided to come back again this week for more temptations.  This time I had the pleasure of meeting the owner who was actually our waiter and I was so impressed by his commitment to his business by providing his most personal service.  He was pleasant and funny and gave us the space to really Taste our luncheon.    My friend had the roast beef sandwich and potato salad and I dove into the large Dagwood sandwich with the squash and pumpkin soup.  Both platters were fresh and delicious, and my sandwich was so large I had to bring the other half home.  The take out box was a very handsome origami carton box which was akin to the simple well designed interior of the restaurant.  To top off our visit we had the chocolate truffles and raspberry mouse and a delicious coffee which was the nicest encore to our already fabulous meal.  Taste scored yet another 5 star meal experience for me and again I recommend it as Calgary's newest hotspot."}
{"text":"The food here is average and the portions are small (as you're supposed to \"Taste\" everything). For the amount that we paid for dinner ($75 for 2 people, no alcohol), we could have gone to a nicer restaurant and left feeling full and satisfied. One dish was a very big disappointment - Chicken IN waffles. Have you ever had the chinese dish some call \"sesame chicken or lemon chicken\" at the food court? Well, that's basically what it was on top of a small portion of instant Uncle Ben's rice (which tasted like it was just microwaved). Will likely not go back unless it was just for a drink."}
{"text":"Oddly, I'm always in the area but I've never eaten here before.  Now that I have, I'm kicking myself that I hadn't done it sooner.  Before I came into Taste I had a certain impression: expensive but small portions, perhaps a good place to entertain a business client...  The reality was slightly different: while you'd never call it cheap, portions are plenty big for 'tapas', and the food is outstanding.  My wife and I left with a $50 bill and I really felt we'd gotten a great deal - 3 tapas and a cocktail and each one was a work of art!  We tried some of the horse tartar - this isn't something I'd order on my own, ever, but someone else at our table had some and I tried it - it was delicious!  I tell you, this is the place to be brave and try something new, because no matter what you have you'll love it!"}
{"text":"Oh this restaurant is so amazing, I absolutely adore it! I wish more restaurants were like this! Taste is another tiny little restaurant in downtown but boy is it worth it. The food is divine, there were many great plates to share throughout our meal and we enjoyed delicious wine on the patio. I'd definitely come back to Taste in a heartbeat. The staff were great, giving us great recommendations when it came to food!   Taste would make a great date night or a lovely place to have drinks after work with your girlfriends. It's pretty tiny so make sure you don't miss it as you walk by. Taste tastes great!"}
{"text":"There's a fight going on in my mouth as I make my way through Taste's mac'n'cheese. (Pro tip: Only $10.50 and includes a side salad or soup. Great deal!). One the one hand, the morsels I'm putting into my mouth are so savoury that I want to get it all in there as fast as I can. On the other, I want to eat it as slowly as I can to make it last. It's a tug-of-war that may end in a draw... two bites devoured, one bite lovingly savoured.  Best cold spring day comfort food ever. And as always, a mini cupcake to finish off my meal and a stellar crew at Taste making it all possible.  Another tip: You can get the mac'n'cheese to go! Seriously filling. Go get some."}
{"text":"Don't overlook this small and chummy restaurant because it comes with amazing tapas and service.    It's a very small place so there's a good chance you have to sit at the bar, but don't let that discourage your opportunity to try this place.    The mac and cheese here was superb. Best I've tasted so far.  Their tomato salad was very fresh.  It came with a unique mascarpone spread and dressing  that was delicious, and I'm not a fan of salad.   I've never heard of duck fat popcorn so I gave that a try.  It tasted like theatre popcorn with chunks of duck meat on top.    I loved the scallops.  It bursted with flavor and the miniature pan they used was very cute.  The seafood platter was delightful and their imported beer selections were quite pleasant.  The washroom was very intimate.  Watch where you're going because it's quite dark.   I love the atmosphere and comfort this restaurant portrays.  The vibe is very relaxed.  Take that along with great food=excellente!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a tapas restaurant in Calgary and came across Taste.   The Short: Great food, Great service, Great ambiance.  ** Tues is a tasting menu for $30 - A good night to try this place out.  **Also, Thurs are 'sausage fest' night where they have sausages and beer on special.  The Long:  Was very excited and looking forward to my tapas meal and to catch up with an old friend. What a wonderful place for both!!! It's not too big, and has a nice cozy ambiance. When the sunsets, its nicely lit with dim (but not too dim) lighting. There are a few tall 'bar' type tables and regular tables mixed together. The music is not too loud so that you can have comfortable conversations.  For dinner, at first I thought the menu was limited. However, after finishing our meal i changed my mind - it is just right.  They have a section that's $5, $10, $15, and then plates of 3 items of 'fish', 'meat', or 'cheese' that's $20 - and those plates are changed frequently.  It's nice cuz every time you come in, you can mix and match different items and have a whole different (yet complete) meal.  All the food we tried was great!!! (more details below)  They have a nice small but varietal selection of 6 reds and 6 whites (all Rieslings tonight), cocktails, and beers. All are changed quite frequently as we were told by our waitress. Our waitress was super nice as we couldn't decide which white wine we wanted (since we normally dont' drink wine) and she let us taste 2 diff bottles to help us decide! Was sooo helpful in our decision and made our dinner enjoyable as we weren't 'stuck' with a glass of wine that we didn't like.  What we ordered (wish i took pics but forgot):  We decided to choose one item from the $5, $10, and $15 meal, and then finish with 2 desserts, and we were full!  1) duck fat popcorn - which is popcorn that was popped/cooked in duck fat. You might think ewww, but it was REALLY tasty! the popcorn actually picked up the duck flavor!  I guess it's good if you like duck, and not so good if you're not a fan of duck, luckily I am a fan of duck!  2) porcini mushroom gnocchi - they make their own gnocchi in house which is nice (the only way I eat it ;) hahah) and it was drizzled with truffle oil. The taste was yummy.   3) Pork belly - my favorite pork belly EVER!!!! There was nice flavour and the skin was mod crispy because it was caramelized!!! sooo yummy with the sweetness that comes through, and with the red pepper sauce it was soo nice.  I would definitely come back here just for the pork belly. A must try!!  4) Shared 2 desserts:  a) tiramisu - it's not a traditional tiramisu, it was a tuile cup filled with lady finger on the bottom ( i believe) and the cream and mocha filled the rest of the cup, with a coconut sauce on the plate which kinda tasted like coconut evaporated milk! hahah. Was a good portion and nice and creamy - but not to overly heavy. I actually enjoyed this more than a traditional tiramisu, and the tuile gives a nice crispy part to it.  b) a trio of creme brulee: cinnamon, ginger, and clove - Very nice flavors, I liked the cinnamon and clove, but didn't care too much for the ginger but that's a personal taste as i don't like ginger that much (such a disgrace being that I'm Asian! hahah jk)."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. Menu looked good and they had gluten free options which is awesome bc I have gluten allergy. The food was super bland. The sundries tomato Sandwhich had a tiny piece of tomato and like 2 pieces of spinach. Was the biggest rip off. We also got the duck fat popcorn which tasted stale. My bf got the salmon and he said it was the worst. We spent $65 on lunch and it was the worst $65 I've ever spent."}
{"text":"Taste might be my favorite restaurant in Calgary right now. Here's my top 5 reasons why:  5. It is good quality food.  4. The wine list is matched to the food and changes often. You get a short list to choose from and you know they'll be delicious. The cocktails are also well made (I'm picky, trust my opinion).  3. The kitchen is open until midnight every night (it's hard to find good food past 9pm in this city).  2. It isn't expensive. I've done a bottle of wine and enough food for 4 people for around $130 there.   1. It's the perfect home away from home. You can linger, ordering a plate or two at a time and enjoying drinks and good company. It's also a great place to go, sit at the counter/bar and have a great time by yourself."}
{"text":"Taste for the love of food, Taste for the need to imbibe with outstanding cocktails, Taste to procure a culinary journey with a good friend, Taste to prime you up for a night of rip, roaring, rodeo fun!   These were all elements of my adventure with the Team at Taste! The husband and wife duo who work the small room with the extraordinary head chef, were an excellent foray for me, into the quaint culinary highs of small space eating in Calgary. Next time you are wandering around the 1st Street area, definitely duck in and see if there is a seat available. Oh, and make sure to order the chirizo meatballs... I think I dreamt about them last night!!"}
{"text":"The food was good, not mind blowing but a nice place to grab some interesting food.  I had the mushroom with soft egg, foie gras and the pork.  The mushroom with soft egg was good, the egg was cooked well and the creaminess went well with the mushroom.  The foie was probably the highlight, it was so creamy and was almost like foie ice cream. Since foie is banned in LA I think this is why I enjoyed it the most.  The pork was ok, the flavors were good but not mind blowing and I wasn't a fan of all the bones in the pork.   I would give this place a 3.5/4 but still a place you should stop by and try."}
{"text":"The wine is really good... But the tapas are just ok.... I think my expectations were not met ... However, I cannot say it was not good... I was just expecting something really good.. The services was not bad, and the ambience was nice..."}
