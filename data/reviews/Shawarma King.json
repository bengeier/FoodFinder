{"text":"meh. order the \"medium\" and not the large, as the large is freakin' HUGE.

this place is pretty good, but i'll admit i have a bit of a soft spot for shwarmas. i'd drive half-way across town to come here, but probably not completely across town. that's how i feel about this place. somewhere in the middle.

certainly worth trying."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service. The restaurant is very clean and nice.This restaurant serves the best Mediterranean food I have ever had in Arizona. Everything is very fresh and superior ingredients. The chicken shawarma plate is beyond delicious."}
{"text":"The two times I've been here the music has been so awkwardly loud it's hard to tell the employee your order. The falafel I had was good so I came back a second time. The music was even louder and there were more friends hanging out in the place than employee, the atmosphere was so uncomfortable that I left without ordering."}
{"text":"Something's changed in the past few months. Not sure if it's new owners, but it does seem to be new employees. The old guys were incredibly efficient and could handle busy traffic. I was in for lunch this week and it took over 20 minutes to get a Shawarma, and the whole handling of customers was incredibly disorganized.

It's a reliabile Donair/Shawarma, but if they can't get their service back it could be a long ride."}
{"text":"Excellent place for vegetarians and vegans. Everything is so fresh and beautifully decorated. Love this place"}
{"text":"Great authentic mediteranean food.  Found it on Yelp and we will keep coming back.  Middle Eastern music playing in the background reminds me of small places I ate at when in that hemisphere.  Nothing flashy about the place, just good food.  Which is the important thing.  The sandwiches are in a rolled pita like a thick wrap so they are easy to eat and not messy.  Got so excited over my beef lamb shawarma wrap I bit my lip.  So worth it."}
{"text":"The restaurant was nice and clean, the BIG problem was that the temperature inside was so hot and uncomfortable. I had to change my Oder to go because it would be like eating a sauna. :-(
As for the $10.00 chicken wrap, it lacked any taste and very overpriced..should have drove another mile to King Gyros."}
{"text":"Updated Review - Still going strong, now with house made pita!!! The falafel (house made and fried to order) is superb; excellently spiced with a crunchy exterior and moist center. You will want to order extra pita, grab a bag of six to elevate your same old lunch 'wrap'. Worth the carbs!!!Great service with a smile. Ask if you do not know what something is and be a little adventurous."}
{"text":"Always big portions, friendly staff but a friend of mine said he has seen the health inspector here a few times as he lives nearby.  I will still eat here but only on occasion."}
{"text":"Heard good things about this joint so 2 friends and I tried the place out on a Monday. Although the whole menu was open, the owner stated there was no lamb or beef, just chicken on Mondays. \"Why not just say that then, rather than wait for us to ask for it?\" He then proceeded to find excuses, \"I'm the only one here...other guy didn't show up...blah, blah , blah\"

Tried it again tonight just to give them the benefit of the doubt (maybe he was having an off day). When I went inside, I noticed I was the only one in the joint. While I was looking at the menu, same guy asks me, \"Are you looking for Chinese restaurant?\"-which was next door...Strike 2, thanks but no thanks Shwarma King."}
{"text":"To be fair! the food is good but that is not enough! the cashier lady (she is the owner) has a horrible horrible attitude she dosn't respect her customers and she thinks that she is making a favor for them, well no! the customers are paying money not just for food they do this for \"customer\"service also , the #1 rule in the business world is to offer a good customer service, or the business will go down to the drain.
first ten visits I thought she is having a bad day so I've tried to be nice to her and greet her about the food they make and how yummy it is, but no matter and she stills rude.
 And if my husband and I try to think about what too choose she would become upset while she is waiting to do our order.
I'm definitely going to another mediterian resturant and there is alot of good ones out there in the valley with perfect customer service and delightful food."}
{"text":"Food was super delicious! service was good as well. Highly recommended. The best Mediterranean food in Glendale."}
{"text":"I drive all the way here from Tempe. The food is as authentic as it gets in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"to be fair and honest food is great....

customer service is horrible..horrible... horrible............

you lady get your act together you are running a restaurant and dealing with customers. customer service and treating customers right is number one priority....."}
{"text":"It's so rare when you can go to a place and just say that you liked everything! My family raved about the pita (closer to naan - exceptional) and the garlic sauce. I got the Shawarma combo plate and nothing that wasn't great on it. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great food!  Great environment! Show up early, the food flues out of the door so fast they run out quickly. The wait is a bit longer than most restaurants, but the quality of the food makes up for the wait. My wife and I's favorite middle eastern restaurant."}
{"text":"This Place is AWESOME!!! I have eaten her about 6 times now. The whole establishment is super clean. You can see all the way through the kitchen to the back door and it is beyond spotless!!! The deco is really nice and classy looking and the ambiance is very inviting. The owners are super friendly and no kidding, they can cook!!!! The food here is the best authentic mediterranean food I have ever had hands down. Its always fresh and I would have to attribute that to the fact that they literally make everything on the menu themselves. No frozen thawed food here. They make their own sauces, spices, EVERYTHING!!! Needless to say, the smell in this place has you droooooooling the moment you walk in and to top it all off, the prices are VERY reasonable...especially considering its all hand made on the spot. YOU MUST GIVE THIS PLACE A TRY!!! WARNING: Its so good, it is addictive!!!"}
{"text":"Owners are super friendly and make you feel welcome.  Ordered take out and when I called to advise I would be very, very late picking up my order because I had been stuck in traffic due to an accident, the woman who took my order seemed concerned until I told her it wasn't me that was involved.  
I've been dreaming about their hummus and need to get in a fix soon -  I love that they garnish it with whole garbanzo beans!! The cheese bourak was very good and is about the size of an egg roll and stuffed with different cheeses and herbs - very tasty! 
Definitely going back!!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious. I've been searching a long time for a restaurant that does shwarmas like I remember having them in Saudi Arabia growing up. The shwarmas here are spot on. The garlic sauce was nice and tangy. The chicken was well seasoned as were the fries and it was topped off with pickles. I'll definitely be back soon. The owner was really nice as well."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Good portions and good quality. The owner needs to hire more people to reduce waiting time. He's usually working by himself."}
{"text":"The best in the valley in Mediteranean and Middle Eastern food fresh and very healthy. ..."}
{"text":"This place is always either closed or out of shawarma. If I go to shawarma king I'm looking to get some shawarma. I can get chicken anywhere. Shawarma king? More like letdown king!"}
{"text":"Thank you for the reply. You refusing to ruin the, very subjective, integrity of your food, as you put it, wasn't the reason I walked out. It was the hostile way that information was relayed to me. This world is full of many different people, just because you enjoy a shwarma one way, doesn't mean everyone else in the world will. If I am paying you my hard earned money for your product, I think I'm entitled to put it into my mouth, and my body, the way that I prefer. I don't think this is a hard ideology to grasp, and frankly it's just good business practice. As soon as I walked into your business I was your guest. You argued (or what seemed like a small argument) in arabic right in front of me while I looked at the menu. That alone I find is disrespectful to a guest. Then the way he glared at me, was the icing on the cake. I was there to give you my business, and that's not how you treat a guest. Maybe things are different Syria, and you are trying to make the customer service \"authentic\" too, I don't know......................."}
{"text":"Got the dry over cooked chicken shawarma ... Dot know what it is but something is definitely different with the ingredient or the condiments ... Even tried the large size but due to dry meat... Almost to the point that it's painful to chew!!! Not sure I will return to this location ..."}
{"text":"By far and away the best falafel I have had in Phoenix!!!! It's not dry and full of cumin like most others. It's very herbaceous and green inside of the crunchy exterior. I have been searching for good falafel and I have found it here. Well done!"}
{"text":"This placed was terrific. It was clean, the food was wonderful and the owner was extremely friendly!

I had the chicken Shwarma and small helpings of babaganoush and hummus. The babaganoush had a subtle smokey flavor that was awesome and the Chicken Shwarma had so much flavor! 

I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Freshly cooked Meat, fresh sauces & big portions = Amazing Food! 
A bit pricier than most Sandwich shops but food is excellent. Falafel is made fresh, not a fan normally but theirs is worth a try. 

Nice ambience and grade A cleanliness -  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I have always driven by here in the West part of town because I have family in the area but I never have been stopped by. I was actually very impressed and I hate to give 5 stars so easily but it is certainly worth it! There were no flaws- good service even if it was just one man, great shwarma reminiscent of the homeland, and very clean establishment. I would also give it an extra star if I could for the courtesy. I do not go to Arabic run resteraunts very often because they have bad blood with my people and there are usually problems, but the man in the counter did not care and was very nice. 

All around excellent food, good authetnic shwarma, clean, and run by a nice man. I will be back certainly"}
{"text":"Where to start, ordered a medium falafel, received and charged for a large. Took it away, lazy dude working the till didn't include any napkins in the bag. Sat down for a meal in the park, noticed that my lunch was left on the flat iron too long and the wax paper had fused to the outside of the pita. So, here I am, in the park trying to salvaged my lunch with no napkin to clean up the horrendous mess that is supposed to be my dinner.

Recommend strongly avoiding as indifference of staff leads to outcomes like the one received. Will not be returning, quality of food is mediocre at best."}
{"text":"I went to Shawarma King expecting to find a typical greek style Gyro and Pita sandwich which I usually love. SK turned out to be quite different... new seasonings, new toppings. It was a grilled wrap instead of a pita. Honestly, I'm not sure I enjoyed it that much. However, I decided to go back about a month later and picked up food for me and my wife. I'm glad I did. We now routinely crave the meat plate... I'm not even sure what type of meat it is(beef & lamb?) but it's damn good. Their hummus is the smoothest, creamiest I've had. The rice is addicting. Fresh salad with lettuce that actually has color to it. Some added pickles and beets. We really enjoy the Falafel dipped in the tahini sauce. Oh, the pita is fantastic too... smells like fresh baked bread.The place is clean and the owners seem very nice. Can't wait to dine in and try other things."}
{"text":"Delicious plates, best one next to Pita Basket. Except they have very good prices. They really need a touch-up on maintaining the look of the place and no doubt will there will be an undeniable increase in traffic. Other than that, it is off to devouring their delicious food!"}
{"text":"My family and I ate here recently and we were disappointed. The food was average and overpriced. The girl who took our order was not pleasant at all."}
{"text":"This place is very good! I order chicken shwarma wraps all of the time and they are always excellent. The staff are super friendly and fast."}
{"text":"So I am a vegetarian . And I love Mediterranean food!! There is so much to choose from here. I am so excited I found this place! The owner was incredible !! He explained the differences in the food and let me sample a few different items without me even asking!!!!! Needless to say I will probably be here once a week!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Only warning: portions are huge so be careful not to over order. I did the meat Shawarma plate and it was amazing. All the ingredients were high quality and fresh. Yes, this is the best falafel you're going to eat. Yes,  the pita bread was the best I've ever had. The sauces were great. I'll be going back."}
{"text":"Tried this once, not normally the kind of food we eat. It was pretty good, hummus was amazing, pitas seemed fresh, a little pricey for what we got but overall pretty good. The staff seemed pretty friendly so no complaints there other than they weren't really helpful when I asked for suggestions, just told me everything was good."}
{"text":"I popped in here to grab a bite to eat.  Whenever I get a chicken shawarma, I always compare it to this amazing Lebanese restaurant my Hubby and I frequented while living in Bangkok, I haven't since had one that even compares.  

So I tried to give shawarma King a fair chance.  the guy working seemed like he was in a hurry to serve me, even though I was the only one in the store.  They have 2 sizes of shawarma, I asked for a medium chicken, which went for $7, which seemed a bit much.  He shaved off my chicken and put it on the grill.  The veggie options are a bit sad looking, I went for tomato, cabbage, onion.  He threw it all together and put it on a grill, while I paid, with a juice it came to almost $11.  The shawarma was pretty big, I can only wonder how big the large is!  I'll admit it was good, definitely hit the spot!

I wasn't wowed by shawarma King, the prices seem a bit steep, but my food was good."}
{"text":"Unbeknownst to many people in the Phoenix area, the Valley is home to a pretty large number of people from the Middle East (especially Iraq, Syria and Palestine), some of whom run quite a few successful Middle Eastern eateries, providing a much needed variety in a dining scene almost monopolized by Latino and fast-food cuisines.  In most cases, I've found the food at these Arab restaurants to be quite good and Shawarma King is no exception to that discovery.

From the point of financial competitiveness, their appetizers are slightly higher priced than other restaurants in the Valley.  This price is not offset by quantity; but appetizers like the hummus and baba ganoush are quite tasty, though I would prefer that they toast or heat up the pita bread which is served with the appetizers..

Unique is the meat they use for shawarma:  if you are used to or expect lamb shawarma, you're going to be very surprised to discover that, in most cases, beef is the meat being used in the shawarmas.  The chicken shawarma was quite good; in appearance, it reminded me of an overly long Hot Pocket.  The vegetarian platter had pickled beets and cabbage; a pickled salad; falafel; tahini and hummus.  However, it did not have the commonly served dolmas; tabouli; or, surprisingly, pita bread.  Nevertheless, the falafel especially was quite good and far from the typically dry ones you get in many restaurants and at $9.99, the price is far from unreasonable.

Shawarma King is something halfway between a fast food joint and a restaurant.  Yes, there are tables and the place is tactfully decorated and clean; but this mom-n-pop shop does not have waiters taking your orders and bringing the food to you.  You go to the counter; put in your order; they make it; and you go and pick it up from the counter.  Is that a bad thing?  No, of course not; but be aware of that, if eating at a \"restaurant\" is important to you and you like being served."}
{"text":"We've always ordered carryout so I'm not sure about inside appearance. But their food is amazing. The cheese bourak appetizers are delicious. We've tried both chicken kabobs and chicken shawarma. Both are very good. Order the combo plate. You get your meat over rice, salad, hummus and pita and you will not be disappointed. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because sometimes they run out of menu items. Also we've called to place an order during hours of operation to no avail."}
{"text":"This is, quite honestly, one of the most amazing dinners I've ever had. When we entered the place, we were unsure of what to get. Unfortunately, they were all out of chicken shawarma BUT we were so lucky to get the beef shawarma, two orders of falafel, and some complimentary hummus because it was our first time. The staff was fantastic, and we were so full by the time we rolled away from the table. AND we have enough for lunch tomorrow!

We will be regulars from now on. Thank you so much for the amazing food experience. We love Shawarma King!"}
{"text":"The best chicken shawarma sandwich in AZ!! The chicken was juicy and tender and the pita bread was made to perfection. I will def be coming back for more."}
{"text":"I've been to this place 3 times and the shawarma was good.
The lady working there was very rude .."}
{"text":"Went there on a Saturday drove from downtown Phoenix ,  they were out of beef Shawarma, wast of gas and miles. Good job Shawarma King"}
{"text":"Alright, now we're talking! As a Lebanese gentleman living in Arizona, finding authentic Levantine food has proven to be quite the challenge. However, after eating from my friend's phenomenal food truck and now Shawarma King, my search has come to a screeching halt. It was a 30 minute drive to Glendale, and I won't hesitate to say it was all worth it. 

The lady at the register, Susan, was super friendly. As I was warmly greeted I looked through the overhead menu which had a nice array of appetizing items. Back in the homeland chicken shawarma sandwiches with garlic sauce and fries were my favorite, so I decided to order one of those. I was quite impressed with the taste. That goodness of marinated chicken, french fries, and creamy garlic sauce really hit the spot. I also appreciated the portion, as the sandwich was quite large and thus possessed a sufficient amount of power to extinguish the hunger fire ravaging my body. As I was enjoying my sandwich Susan kindly offered me a sample of this place's hummus. I guess people weren't joking when they said this was the best hummus they've had in the States. Not only did it have the exact same smooth texture and magnificent taste as the hummus back home, the green spice on top sealed the deal for me. There is no better hummus in America than the kind at Shawarma King, I'll just put it like that.

Friendly service and delicious food make this one a must go. Like I said, worth the drive. I'd gladly come back. Thanks for the great experience guys!"}
{"text":"I have tried this place a few times now. Don't care for the shwarma wrap so much... but we keep coming back like hounds for the chicken shawarma platter. This hot mess has the garlic goodness that I crave.

What you get is a mountain of food - too much for me to finish but just right for others. The things I love about this platter are the garlic sauce, the seasoning of the chicken and the fact that the chicken is moist. Hate when it's all dried out. Hate even more when the chicken has those chunky, chewy, hard \"mystery\" bits - I have never had that experience here, thank goodness. You get the usual with this platter:  pita, rice, chicken, potatoes, some kind of lettuce, maybe some pickle? I forget but I would say it's the usual platter stuff.

We even hit up delivery once; it's slow and pricey but kind of nice to have the option. Shawarma platters kind of go hand in hand with Netflix and sweatpants, so sometimes delivery is a must!"}
{"text":"If you are in the area, this is a must try! The food here is excellent.

The chicken kabob meat has great flavor! And the shawarma platter is full of delicious items like hummus, rice etc...

The only downside is the wait can be long and the prices are a little high. Grab a Togo menu and call in your order ahead of time to beat the wait."}
{"text":"Once you try their fresh pita bread, every other pita bread will seem like a cheap imitation. Very satisfied. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I am not happy to have to write a low star review for this place because I love the food,  but the owner recently made the decision to remove the grill items off the menu and that's the whole reason I drove 10+ miles to go there. No more kabobs. It's a dreadful decision that I think is going to hurt his business a lot and I wish he would rethink it. Not everyone like shawarma. The kabob plates were outstanding. Their hummus is out-of this-world creamy and delicious. I am bummed to not be able to visit there anymore. I hope the grill items return."}
{"text":"Everything we've had from here has been delicious, but the pillowy fresh pita bread and hummus are outstanding. I just wish they weren't sold out of it so often!"}
{"text":"Great place! I love coming here for lunch. I come here many time during work to grab a quick meal and also I come here with friends for an early dinner. My wife always gets a healthy meal with salads and felafel and hummus. I like their kebab and their shawarma. The food here is fresh and tasty. They serve nice size portions here."}
{"text":"This is my second time here shawarma it's pretty good I think the last time I had it was better but they were super busy that day that could have been the reason and they gave soup with the sandwich not this time overall it was okay might be back don't know"}
{"text":"The falafel here is the perfect vehicle for the authentic spice mix! Would recommend to people who like eating at good restaurants."}
{"text":"Amazing. Thank you Yelpians for the recommendation. This place has some of the best greek food around. Chicken kabob plate, vegetarian falafel plate, hummus and the yellow rice I could not get enough. The staff is extremely nice.

Get there early, everything is made fresh. When they run out, they're out for the day. 

I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Had the chicken shawarma plate...ton of food! Shawarma had a lovely cardamom flavor, and was cooked perfectly. The rice and humus had a nice balance that perfectly complimented the shawarma.  Excellent customer service. Nice atmosphere. And a really clean, quaint restroom, which one really appreciates after 8 hours on the road!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, falafel OMG best. Everything fresh, I'll definitely be back. Very nice staff super clean."}
{"text":"My wife and I saw the sign this morning.  I pulled up to look in and see if it is open for business yet or \"coming soon\".  The owner spotted me and came to the door to say hello.  He said they have been open for a couple of weeks.  After shaking hands and wishing him well, he handed me a menu and I said I'd try and get back soon.

We decided to get some \"to go\" for lunch a few hours later.  When I got there he was in the open kitchen and a very nice woman greeted me.  He also gave me a big greeting.  Already I feel like I'm at my local being treated like a favorite long time customer!  I ordered a chicken shawarma, a babaghanoush plate with beef/lamb shawarma and a kubbah ball appetizer.  They told me that there is no chicken shawarma because their big 2 spit shawarma machine only has 1 side working and they have to do chicken one day and beef/lamb another because of it.  They are awaiting parts all the way from Jerusalem where the machine was shipped from.  No problem on my end, but they could not have been nicer about it.  He even handed me a sample of the beef/lamb during this chat.  It was right off the spit and truly yummy.  

Then they asked me which babaghanoush I wanted since they have two versions.  A traditional tahini one or their version with tomato and diffrent spices.  Before I could even think about it he was handing me a sample.  It was amazing.  So after paying up (the prices are beyond reasonable, this place is a bargain!), I sat down to wait.  A moment later he comes to the counter to explain that it will be a couple of minutes so he has made me a couple of falafel so I would not mind the wait.  Are you kidding me?  This might be the friendliest service I have gotten anywhere in years.

So how was my lunch?  My wife and I just LOVED it and can't wait to go back.  This was a treat and it was something different from our usual choices.  I really hope these guys do great.  I promise that we will definately be back."}
{"text":"Unpretentious, friendly, clean but most importantly delicious. This cute little family owned restaurant is a great find. I drove from Scottsdale to check it out and was pleasantly surprised. Homemade and served with pride and a smile. In a sea of middleastern food, this is a must to try. Great shwarma, light and scrumptious falafel, and to die for homemade from scratch humus. Bravo"}
{"text":"This was our first time at shawarma.I order the fattoush salad and my friend had the Mediterranean salad with chicken. This was the first time we eat in silent. No words where said has we enjoy our amazing dinner. Both salads were wonderful. The fattoush was light salad but wonderfully flavorful. And the Mediterranean  had all the right spices.  The employees were ready to take orders and have them out asap. And even though their isn't any waitresses . They came and  ask if we need anything else and how was everything.Definitely coming back again!!!"}
{"text":"My husband loves this place. Since he is from the Middle East, we have been to every Middle Eastern restaurant around and this is by fav his favorite. It's normal for him to eat there once or more a week.

He says the lamb and beef shawarma is the most authentic he's had here. He also likes the shish kabobs, falafel and salads. The prices are great, too, costing him only about $7.

The service is good and the food is fresh and affordable and reminds him of home. That's good enough for me."}
{"text":"Awesome food, awesome clean restaurant! Awesome workers behind the counter!! Great clean home made food in a little restaurant with food made fresh when you order it!! Also awesome falafel!!"}
{"text":"Ordered online and my husband picked it up not knowing what all was ordered. They didn't include the pita which I ordered alongside the falafel (which I wouldn't have ordered if I'd known I wouldn't receive the full meal). Got home to find the chicken shawarma wrap we ordered charred black on one side, and the chicken inside overcooked to the point of being tough. To be fair, they did reimburse us for the pita, but with no apology. Also, not a big deal for us since we ate it at home, but they didn't include the forks and plates that I asked for either. It wasn't a special request, but an option given on the site, so it just shows further that they aren't careful with the orders. I won't choose this place again."}
{"text":"Best falafel in town hands down 
Clean place , fast service , great food 
Owners are awesome and generous"}
{"text":"I am of Lebanese descent, new to Arizona, from VA, via CA.  I am trying to visit each and every Lebanese/Arabic/Middle Eastern Restaurant in the greater Phoenix area and rate them comparatively.

I saw that this place had 4 1/2 stars, so I thought I will give it a try. Unfortunately, I could not. He would not allow me to be seated because I had a service dog with me. And they did not have outdoor seating. 

When I explained to him that he cannot refuse service to someone accompanied by a service dog, he said, \"keep him in the car\". He did not know that \"Under Arizona's service animal law and the federal Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), people with disabilities may bring their service animals to all \"public accommodations,\" including restaurants, schools, grocery stores, ....\". He said he did not know and did not care. No dogs, service or otherwise, are allowed in.

If you are someone with a service dog, you cannot eat there with your dog accompanying you. If I had a dog that was not a service dog or did not have a dog at all, but I am a dog lover, and I respect the law  of the land, I wouldn't eat there. The owner's attitude, rudeness, and not being aware that he is now living in a country governed by laws, would make me not go back there.

Unfortunately, you cannot give zero stars on Yelp. The place would have deservedly earned it. You cannot rate an establishment you cannot enter. And I am not keeping my dog in the car, in 84-degree weather at noon,  for a Shawarma sandwich!  

BTW, we were there exactly at noon. There was only one customer, and he appeared to be a friend of the manager/owner (acted like he was both - I have no way of knowing). 

At noon, with zero customers! How did this place get 4 1/2 stars."}
{"text":"We drove from 7th Street and Northern just to try this place and I am so glad we did!! The falafel is light and airy and so full of flavor!! Beef shawarma and hummus is excellent and my fiance got the cabbage salad and I am jealous! I'm definitely getting that next time! The ingredients are fresh and it comes through in the flavor!!"}
{"text":"Love there food... super clean place.. I get the vegeterain platter its gorgeous, purple cabbage salad soooooo yummy.. humus is like velvet, falafel happines.. and that green hot sauce is NO joke.."}
{"text":"Worst experience and customer service I have ever had. They were very rude and disrespectful. I invited my friend for lunch at this restaurant and during we eating, some customers just came to the restaurant and they asked the employee if the food halal or not and he told them it is not. I thought he was joking, I directly asked him are you serious or what!? because there were halal signs attached to each wall n this place even their menu then the employee (I think he is the owner as well) starting yelling and said you have to ask before ordering here and what's the difference between the halal food and other they are the same then I told him what about the halal signs on the walls and menu? and he became more rude when I told him this. It was very shameful position especially at front of my friend which he just eating halal."}
{"text":"Amazing hummus, probably the best I've ever had (and I've been to the Middle East twice) amazing shawarma. This place is one of the best, most authentic places I've found in the states. Love the food and the owner was so nice!! I live in Washington but I will definitely visit this place everything I'm in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Best shawarma in Phoenix for sure. The sauces are simply amazing.

I simply cannot compare with something else. Reasonable price nice service.
I'll continue support this business.
Recommend!!!!!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch.  Very casual, clean authentic Mid-Eastern. My meat shawarma wrap had fresh onions and pickled turnips.  Very tasty.  My husband's chicken shawarma is pictured. We also ordered the fries.  They had been seasoned with what tasted like a citrus salt. Yummy. We will definately return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"The closest to authentic shawarma and falafel you can find in phoenix area. I was so happy to find something that reminded me of dubai. Their garlic dip certainly deserves a special mention which they  generously apply on the sandwiches. One of their  perks is that they have plenty of options for vegetarians. I've already been there a couple of times...if only there was a branch  in scottsdale.."}
{"text":"I don't know where to start. This place is by far the best shawarma place in the valley if not the state. I grew up eating shawarma and this place is the only one that reminded me of Damascus shawarma and  I've been and tried many places and none came close to the authentic taste and I know how that tastes.  Shawarma King is the king and it is on my bookmark now."}
{"text":"Amazing food ... Shawarma made 100% as it is made in the  Middle East... Fresh and amazing accompanied with great taste, and quality food... Not to mention fresh bread made in-house ..Reasonable price with great portion.  he doesn't cheat you in portion size.  Will continue to support this business.. A must try place!!"}
{"text":"This was the 3rd time we visited this place and it was the final visit.  He was out of almost of everything and he didn't even care!! Don't waste your time and go there when there is no food to serve no salad, no rice. The customer service was poor.  The owner was rude and his attitude was poor towards customers. The one star is for the good food!"}
{"text":"In a desert of Chicago style gyros shops valley wide ive been looking for that oasis serving more authentic middle eastern style food.  At Shwarma King ive finally found it on the west side.  The more authentic style toasted sandwiches are excellent (and certainly more elegantly chowed down than a giant overflowing pita).  The hummous was perfectly spiced.  Not too much cumin as some shops do.  Not too peanutty flavored as some can be.  But perfect.  The lemon shining through but not overwhelming.  And the Falafel!  Best ive ever had.  As a valley native who misses the old Urban Cafe in Tempe, this place finally offers up a Middle Eastern style meal I will drive out of the way for.  Well done, and thanks to the owners who couldn't have been any nicer to a couple looking for a late meal (15 minutes before closing).  I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I've been dying to try this place out since I'm a huge fan of Greek food. Not the lame-o Chicago style gyros (They have their place...I guess) but authentic, homemade Greek family food. That's what you will get at Shawarma King!  The servings are large, colorful and full of flavor. My mom got the Vegetarian Plate Special and I typically don't care for meatless entrees but it was fantastic and so beautifully prepared! We almost hated to start eating because the plates looked so lovely.. almost. I ordered the Fattoush Salad and added the chicken shawarma on top. It was good, maybe a little pita chip heavy, but I would definitely order it again. especially with a serving of their garlic sauce and a side of falafel! (So good!!)

The prices on most items seem reasonable especially given the amount of food you get. They also offer chicken nuggets for kiddos. A nice feature, I thought. 4 small (McDonalds size) chicken nuggets and tons of fries for $4.99 seemed a liiiiittle steep to me. Next time I go I'll just pack a lunch for the kids or pick up a couple happy meals instead since they aren't very adventurous eaters.

I hope this place is around for a while. Business seemed slow but their food is excellent. Give it a try, you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"OMG, I have died and gone to Falafel Heaven! Shawarma King's falafel in Phoenix, Arizona ties Oasis' Falafel in Iowa City. Why? These perfectly fried morsels are crispy on the outside but are soft and fluffy on the inside, they are gingerly spiced. They are accompanied with a tangy tahini sauce that is a lovely complement. Get it by itself: 4 delectable balls for $3.50 or get in in the Arabic Vegetarian Feast. I like the red cabbage and the above average hummus which comes with pita bread that feels like a warm comforter in your mouth.

The marinated chicken shawarma wrap was tasty and juicy, I was licking the juices off my fingers. The wrap is nicely toasted and the blend of sauces and pickled veggies are so yummy. WARNING: Garlic Alert. Ideal for keeping vampires away.

The chef was awesome! He was friendly and super fast. Food is prepared upon order and comes piping hot. 

*Where is the picture of the falafel? Oops, I don't know. They were gone before I got my camera out. Fancy that, I was by myself. Bad me."}
{"text":"By far best Shawarma I have had! Strong Garlic Sauce, perfect toasted and chewy pitta with excellently seasoned chicken, lamb or beef all paired with fresh herbs and vegetables. This is a perfect combo or flavor and textures. Creamy sauce, chew warm bread, moist chicken and fresh herbs are wonderful what make this a great shawarma. The fries are also nicely cooked."}
{"text":"Best shawarma I've ever tasted I live in Tempe and I drive once a week there I guess that explains how good is the restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"This is THE best Sharma place in town. I prefer Shawarma King over all other Middle Eastern places in town. They have a great menu. It is not over welcoming and has just the right amount of items. I have tried many things on the menu and all of them have been amazing. My favorite thing here is the Beef and Chicken Shawarma Deluxe. You can order food to go or eat there. It may be small inside but its clean and well kept.

The staff is awesome! They work hard and do a great job. You can tell they enjoy their job and what they do.

There is plenty of parking and there is no need to worry about that.

I highly recommend everyone to try this place out. You will not be disappointed.

Remember that they will be closed on Mondays. Sometimes I forget, haha."}
{"text":"I'm far from being a shawarma expert, having only been to a few other places, but this place served me the best one I've had so far (and the only one that made me want more).

The only downsides for me was that it was cash only (despite the Interac sticker on the door) and their ATM was out of service.

There is a bar to sit at if you're not taking away."}
{"text":"This food is so good that I would buy stock in the company, if I could. This Mom and Pop will grow into a chain. 

I live very close, but have only just tried it. My whole family loved the Shawarma plates. The Yelp rating of 4.5 stars was right on. 

They even gave my four year old candy, when we ordered. 

Check it out."}
{"text":"Yesterday I was craving chicken shawarma and was recommended this place.

The chicken shawarma was good (the best part was the garlic! There is no such thing as too much garlic). The chicken was dry for my personal liking. The service was great, priced reasonable, and I'd go back with the hopes the chicken isn't dry."}
{"text":"This place has the only REAL shawarma in the valley. Many places have it on the menu but it's not the true shawarma that is cut fresh from the vertical rotisserie. Everything is made with heart. The owner is the chef. Shawarma is definitely my favorite but the falafel is also amazing."}
{"text":"I had heard about this place and we just wanted a couple of shawarmas to go, did not have to be fancy, just good. It was OK.
We got 2 mediums (no smalls available) and it was recommended to us by the gent behind the counter to get the chicken and lamb. Sure, why not. At the til when paying, he added a $1 for each one for the lamb bits we got. Oook. Too bad as the lamb was not really worth it, it was really dried out. The pita was ok, not the freshest I have ever had (I think I prefer the fluffier ones), same goes for the toppings. Not bad, just not out of this world. 
Tip 1 - make sure you are not going too far to eat as your shawarma will fall apart on you.
Tip 2 - only ask for half of the 3 sauces you get (refer back to tip 1). If not, your mouth will be coated in garlic (not USUALLY a bad thing) and you will not be able to taste much else in your sammy.
$22 for 2 meds and a can of diet Coke. I was looking at the menu on the wall after ordering and I feel maybe the platters are a better deal for $9.50 each.
Open til 4am!"}
{"text":"dis place so good!! amazing. wow imf. cant say enough about it. Amazing service guy so nice, wife so nice, food so good.
Can't wait for the new menu! Sup zayd"}
{"text":"Good food. My only knock is that the spice seem disproportionate. I think when seasoning is placed its not even spread across the item. Good food. To me, tediously annoying music (it could have been just what happened to come on)."}
{"text":"Great food! Everything is always fresh, and like a few other reviewers have said, the falafel is so good that I no longer order it anywhere else but here."}
{"text":"Great food, charming owners...son did not looked thrilled. But hey he is a teenager..it happens. Chicken shwarma was moist and good flavor. Love love the bread. Baklava was nice. Lots of honey. Overall good 1st experience, will be back with family. Appreciated the owners were friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"After seeing Iron Man 3 I've been looking for a Shawarma! So I mosey on in at about 11:30 and try to order some chicken shawarma. No dice the friendly lady behind the counter say. Ok Lay some beef shawarma on a plate and hand it over! No can do! WH-WH WHAT I ask. After talking some back and forth in a very wild sounding langue the chubby but super cute lady tells me that the meat will on be ready for at least an hour! How in the wide wide world of sports is a going on here? You signature dish 
is not ready for over an HOUR after you open?!?!?!!? Hey here is an idea... Come in early. If it take an hour and a half to cook and you open at 11:00 get there at 9:00! WoW! What an idea!!!! Come in early to PREP!!!!! IDK... I REALLY want to try shawarma... So I guess I'll have to wait until two hours AFTER you open to try it... Kinda sad..."}
{"text":"The owners are extremely nice and the food is quite delicious. Nice, Authentic, and a great taste of the Middle East."}
{"text":"This place has ruined all other falafel for me. I have never had such flavorful light and fluffy falafel. Don't miss this hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Owners are super nice. The food is amazing. If you haven't tries middle eastern food, this is the place you should go to for a great introduction. Everything is amazing. There hummus is smooth and creamy, Not to forget made fresh like everything else. The lentil soup is the best I have tasted and want more of. 
It cost is very reasonable and the service can't get any better.
Be adventurous and try out the menu. You can not go wrong with the quality of their food.

Try out this restaurnt, is fantastic!!!"}
{"text":"The best hummus I've ever had, and I've had A LOT!  Also, it's better than I can make at home, and I've been trying to perfect my own hummus for years.  I also really enjoy the pickle mix (dip into hummus, yum!)  The sandwiches are great, and the menu is easy to navigate.  

Yes, one time I went there they were out of chicken.  Keeping in mind that this is a mom/pop type of restaurant, with food prepared fresh, I understand.  It's not like Subway where you run out of meatballs and then just go in the back and get another prepared plastic tub.  When you run out, you run out for the day--that's how it goes.  I find a lot of people complain about corporate chains, yet when they find a privately run place they complain when things aren't run by a corporate playbook."}
{"text":"This place does not live up to the hype.  I wouldn't bother stopping by unless you happen to live in the area."}
{"text":"Yes The food here is bomb i recommend the shawarma but who wants to go somewhere they dont feel welcomed the lady working there is the only thing wrong with this place lol she was VERY VERY rude whatever i asked for she told me she was out of but when i had my male friend call in a order all a sudden they had everything. idk what her deal is but if ur a girl be aware of her she thinks ur gonna take her husband away from her or something shes really nice to all my guy friends that go there but as u can see from other female comments this lady is something else when it comes to other women. insecure maybe?"}
{"text":"Amazing shawarma! Chicken and beef are both killer. The pitas are like nothing I've had before. Next time I'm coming back for the shawarmadillas!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been missing great Middle Eastern food since our move to Arizona in June.  I had high hopes for this place when I called to ask some questions. They were friendly and very interested in explaining their dishes. The restaurant is a fooler because its in a little strip mall.  But don't be fooled, this food is awesome.  The kitchen is super clean and the bathrooms are cleaner than some fine dining places I've been.  I had the Kifta kabob plate.  It was pretty incredible. The meat was moist and well seasoned. The rice was excellent.  The rice!  So many places mail it in on the rice. I could've eat the rice as a meal it was that good.  The side salad I had with my meal had a dressing that should be bottled and sold.  Let's just say that I'm glad this place isn't closer because I'd have to go there every day...at least."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  I am a vegetarian, so I love all the choices, especially the vegetarian feast.  My husband on the other hand eats meat, so he loves the meat schwarma with a side of crinkle cut fries.  There are a ton of choices for both of us.  Also, love the, oh so fresh, pita bread.

This place is very neat and clean and is owner operated, so there is a vested interest in the customer's satisfaction.  I also love the white board today, that said \"attitude is contagious\" and espoused the virtue of humility.

I love supporting this small business.  The food is truly the best around, and it is right in my neighborhood.  One more thing.  They deliver, so there is no reason to not try this place."}
{"text":"They had no chicken when we went, and were the first ones there before their regulars started streaming in for dinner, so I questioned the quality of food...
but the shawarma was excellent, with a great variety of toppings. I was able to get picked turnip with tomatoes and cucumber, and my choice of sauce. 
Their fries are flavored with a lemon salt seasoning that I really enjoyed too. 
Plus, the owner had great humor, and the meat is halal. If you're craving simple Middle Eastern food, this is definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"This is my second time here. The first time I was here I loved it. Today, they changed the menu to sandwich only and said they don't do plates anymore. It was disappointing. I'm bummed that there wasn't any hummus. I wish that they would still have the same menu like when I walked in the first time. On the other hand, the falafel sandwich in the laffa and the fries were good. That's why I gave 3 stars."}
{"text":"I have been going there since they opened and have tried everything there.  I have recently arrived here from Los Angeles and have been very disappointed in the quality of food in my neighborhood. Then I found Shawarma King!

The food here has always been fresh, healthly and delicious.  All of the meat dishes have been cooked perfectly, moist, well seasoned and they use a quality meat. The falaffal is the best I have ever had and the salads are delicious. Try the rice pudding while you are at it. WONDERFUL!!

It is nice when a restaurant really takes pride in its appearance and the presentation.  You can see this in the owners and in their opening of a their new restaurant.   I have told all of my friends and will continue to go there for lunch and dinner. I think that I will have that for lunch today.  

Try it once and you will go back time and time again."}
{"text":"Why say you're open until 9 if you're not going to serve customers after 8:30? At least have the guts to say you're too lazy to make the food instead of claiming you've sold out of everything."}
{"text":"Bar far the best food in the area !!!!! If want your taste buds to come alive with flavor awesomeness then come here . I really like the atmosphere here it feels really relaxed and chill and  I like how clean everything is as well as the restroom  which is really important to me ."}
{"text":"This was my favorite Shawarma in the US (have tried a few around the country). My recent visit has altered my opinion ...for some reason they have changed the ingredients in the wrap which is ridiculous as they had the best tasting ingredients (why would they do that?). The add cheese to it now (yuck!). I ordered the wrap without cheese but still got cheese in it and also had on garlic sauce on it. Their garlic sauce was to die for and they used to apply ample amount in the wrap. And the size is smaller than before.
I hope they go back to their original recipe soon. I have bragged about this place to do my if my friends."}
{"text":"Bes shawarma I've ever had if you're in town you must try this chicken shawarma and the tabole was Amazin,, the owner is so friendly and the place is awesome"}
{"text":"Customer service wasn't the greatest, maybe she was having a bad day? Went to pick up up some lunch at 1 pm, ordered vegetable platter and combo plate. We asked if we could order a couple extra pitas to go along with our dinners, NO PITAS, WHAT??!!   YEP, THEY HAD NO PITAS. So instead we were given dry tortillas with grill marks.  Hummus was tasty as was the falafel. My husband thought the meat was mediocre, but also liked the hummus. Ordered baklava for dessert, horrible, tasted old and was super dry, we ll be sticking with the medditerranean place down the road."}
{"text":"Authentic fresh delicious. Don't waste your time at other places this is it. This is must try it will become one of your favorites."}
{"text":"After one visit I gather that Shawarma King is very above average in the kind of cuisine it is. (Fast Casual Middle Eastern) I really enjoyed all the unique offerings and different variations of these Mid East Classics. Overall everything was very good, I enjoyed how different this place was.

We never had Cheese Boubak before so we tried them. They look like Giant Spring Rolls but are stuffed with a seasoned cheese blend and are tasty anyone would like them.

I tried the Vegetarian Feast Plate so I could try as much as possible. My plate was made of Felafel's, Hummus, Babaganoush, Purple Cabbage salad, Pickles, and I think Arabic Salad. (menu listed Tabbouleh but I heard after I received my meal they were out of Tabbouleh for the day) and House Made Pitas. 

The felafel's are very unique. They were the crispest ones I ever tried anywhere with a hard crunch. (I sort of worried about my fillings) They were made with fresh herbs but had a different seasonings than others I tried from other places. I'm not sure but I thought I tasted caraway in them. Dips were both good. I really enjoyed the Purple Cabbage salad as it was light and filling at the same time and is something not all other places offer. The chopped vegetables were very bright with lemon and flavored of fresh parsley. The pitas were fresh baked and were much better than from a package but were a sturdy style.

My husband tried a Combo Plate it had one dip on it I wasn't familiar with. It was thick and white and tasted sort of cheesy garlicky and lemony. I tried the chicken, it was white meat but very tasty.

They don't offer Yemenite Sauce but offer Sriracha if you desire a hot kick. I think that's kind of odd as they are not at all similar in taste.

The owner seems nice and ask how everything is but communication isn't the best but that is how it is at these kind of places.

Above average, something different and worth a try!"}
{"text":"I was very impressed with this place when we went there for lunch last week.  The food was very good and filling especially for the price. We will return and try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved it! Cheap and great for the prince, totally recommended. I tried the mixed shawarma (neef and lamb)"}
{"text":"I give this place a 3.5 stars out of 5. No complaints, the food was good. My dad ordered the chicken kabab plate and he said it was \"good\", translated = he really liked it, just doesn't stand out from all the other places. I had the chicken shawarma sandwich, which I'm a HUGE fan of, and would travel 50 miles without even blinking if it's a GOOD and AUTHENTIC shawarma, which this place claims to have. I have had authentic shawarmas in Arab lands, and sorry to say, but their shawarmas are NOT authentic. They're not bad at all, but not authentic shawarmas as they claim. I've been to several places in the US and whenever I go someplace new, I make sure to try and find the best shawarma joint in the area. My favorite in the valley for Shawarma remains Baiz Market, it's pretty close to the real thing. But the BEST and MOST AUTHENTIC I have found so far in the US is this place called \"Afrah\" in Richardson, Texas. They don't claim to serve the real thing, but they do. Took me back to Saudi Arabia, its SPOT ON!
The food is great, really. I tried the beef shawarma here too and it's actually better than most places in the valley. For me, I was already planning on coming here at least once a week even though its a 25 mile drive each way, but in the end, NOT AUTHENTIC, therefore not worth it."}
{"text":"Very good and tasty food. Nice treatment and low prices. Not very fancy place but totally one of the best Mediterranean restaurants I have ever tried. It's totally suggestible."}
{"text":"Bummed out.  Walked in, ordered their chicken plate and they said they were sold out.  He didn't suggest anything else or try and persuade me into another dish.  It was just simply \"Sorry, ok....next customer please\".  Lol.  Talk about not caring about winning over a new customer.  I may try them again so see if they can redeem themselves as they are close to my house.  Smelled good in there, that's why they get 2 stars."}
{"text":"We've become take out regulars because the food really just can't be beat. Easily the best Mediterranean/middle eastern food in the area. Schwarma plates are huge, the Schwarma combo is 2 meals for me. The hummus is really great, the salad dressing is delicious and the fries are always crispy and seasoned well. I have been told they were sold out before and am still giving 5 stars as I'd rather them run out of fresh prepared food than be serving me something pre made or frozen."}
{"text":"we just had 2 chicken pitas and falafel for Valentine's lunch.the food is amazing and the fresh pita out of the oven is to die for.i love the flavor of the chicken shawarma.i have tried other stuff on the menu and they're all good ..keep the good business and I hope you'll have fresh pita every time I'll come in !! i forgot to mention about the Hershey chocolate kisses that we were offered"}
{"text":"The chicken shawarma wrap is my new favotite. I love this place. My wife is a vegetarian and she loves this place too."}
{"text":"Tried this place for lunch recently. A total disappointment. First food was way over spiced chicken and beef shawarma. Had no pita bread only tortilla bread..really? No ice in soda machine. I mean is this a real restaurant that feels they can charge Persian room prices but deliver McDonalds quality? And only one person working? I mean 3 strikes and they are out. This was a total waste of money. Better choices in the valley. The hummus was good but $7 overpriced. I would not recommend this place. I am middle eastern and lived in Chicago where I could get authentic Mediterranean cuisine and awesome shawarma. This place isn't even close.  Person behind counter was bald gentleman, seemed nice but the restaurant can't cut it. Honestly, I spent about $50 with family hardly ate it drove over to Wendy's to finish lunch. Kids who eat anything didn't even want to eat food because too much seasoning zatar and greasy.  Place would shut down if was in Chicago, Detroit, or LA. Lastly, should have know when I walked in it was dead like the soda machine. Never again waste of money and food was blah. They will shut down in less than 12 months watch.  Thank you Az Izzy."}
{"text":"Awesome fresh pitas, must give it a tr good healthy fast. Don't forget to try the hummus."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I regularly travel half an hour specifically to get the chicken shawarma here. The flavors meld beautifully, particularly with the delicious garlic sauce. The texture is perfect as well. We tried many shawarma places in the greater Phoenix area, and this is our unrivaled favorite!!"}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean food I ever had in the valley, the place is so clean, they are very friendly and courteous, the food is yummy, my favorite is the chicken shawarma deluxe but if you don't eat garlic then I would stay away from the deluxe!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Had the veggie combo. Huge portions, artful presentation. Very clean. Very friendly owners. I would go out of my way to come back. It's that good."}
{"text":"Fantastic, authentic Shawarma in a nice, clean restaurant. Owners and staff are awesome!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I have been craving some real authentic Shawarma for the longest time in AZ, and finally my friend told me that this place has it so I knew I had to try it, I will not mind the food is pretty amazing and definitely has the authentic flavor but they really need to brush up on their customer service skills... Based on the reviews I read I noticed that this is a pattern with this place, not very friendly and don't really care for you when you come in! Their chicken shawarma is delicious, the hummus is tasteless and over priced, and the frozen French fries should be substituted with real potato fries! But despite the poor service, we will most likely be back, food is good!"}
{"text":"This isn't a review of the food, just the way the business is run. I was anxious to taste their chicken schawarma and arrived about 10:55 a.m. I went to the door and saw that they opened at 11 a.m., so I went back to wait in my car and play some candy crush on my phone. I waited until 11:15, but they never opened. Maybe I'll give them another chance since they have such good reviews, but if they're reading this, \"Please open on time!\""}
{"text":"This place really is fantastic. The owners are so friendly and generous and clearly take pride in their work. The food is phenomenal and for extremely reasonable prices -- not to mention the owners usually provide free samples of food as well. All in all, a fantastic eating experience for a great price. Oh and the falafel is the best I've had."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The food was so good I had to come back again the next day and bring my friends. The place was very clean and the owner was super friendly. This place is a MUST try. They have the best shawarma sandwiches in the valley. Truly the king of shawarma"}
{"text":"Came in here on a Sunday and it's great that they're open because almost every other place in the area was closed. Regardless there were quite a few good reviews so I gave it a try.

I had the chicken wrap and it definitely was really good! Also, make sure to get their spicy sauce! 

I also bought a couple bags of their freshly made pita bread which was also amazing. Seriously super soft and fresh and it stayed like that for me until I ate all of it (a few days, but I'm sure it woulda stayed that fresh for a week or so). 

I definitely recommend this place and will be back whenever I'm in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"The owners are always a delight. I'm always taking people here to try their food. Their sandwiches are amazing. They have the best hummus of anywhere I've ever had. If you find yourself in the area, definitely check it out, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Chicken shawarma: AMAZING!
Falafel? OUT OF THIS WORLD!! It is really hard to find good falafel outside of someone's home these days. They are almost always dry, from a mix, overcooked, and of the same style. One bite of these and I knew two things: 1) These are fresh and not from a mix; and 2) These are authentic Syrian style falafel.

Go for the shawarma, but get extra falafel. If I had any criticism at all it would be that falafel to-go comes in styrofoam plastic that makes them soggy and you have to crisp them up in the oven. They have been very accommodating and putting them in paper bags when I ask and they stay crispy that way. Can't get enough of this place. I live in the East Valley so I try to get here every time I'm in the West Valley."}
{"text":"The shawarma or donair is JAM packed with meat. Like I was literally stunned when the dude pulled out how much chicken he was going to put. And it was awesome."}
{"text":"Had the Chicken Shawarma which was excellent! I know they are called the Shawarma King but I believe it should also be called the Hummus King because it is excellent as well. Friendly service and clean restroom! Also has great authentic Middle Eastern music!!! Also you have to come early, since they are known more for their chicken I am a steak/meat eater and didn't get to order it! Definitely the next time we are by this way!!!!"}
{"text":"Waited for 10 minutes for my chicken shawarma sandwich. The place wasn't busy in the middle of the afternoon and the chicken was right there spinning. 

Then I learned that it was fries I was waiting for. Unusual though, the 5 or 6 fries I got were actually inside the shawarma sandwich. Very different. Interesting maybe but good??? Not so much. 

The sandwich's tastes were distinctly separated by ingredients. One bite was all cheese. The next the other fillings. Then the meat - which was the most tasteless part very disappointingly. 

I don't throw out food often (I figure I paid for it so I'll finish it) but midway through I was completely unsatisfied and disinterested. 

Very poor value for a tasteless inauthentic meal."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken Shawarma plate omg I'm so glad I did! The food was off the chain! Very delicious, the chicken was moist, the rice had the right amount of seasoning the whole plate was phenomenal."}
{"text":"The best shawarma I have ever had in Arizona. I highly recommend this place. We ordered two beef shawarma and they gave us a free 4 falafel pieces and everything was perfect"}
{"text":"Found out about this place 2 months ago and I have been here 4x since and spent between $17-20 just on myself. The food here is good however after my last experience I found out the owners are extremely unprofessional and unappreciative of their customers.

They brought me my food ate a couple pieces of chicken and I noticed hair in my hummus. I wanted to be polite and not make a scene so I privately showed the owners the hair in my hummus. Owner flips out, points at me and says \"I have no hair so it's your hair!\"
Has a horrible attitude reiterating that the hair was mine and makes me a new plate like he was doing me a favor. 

Wont be coming back and I will no longer recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Every time I come here its delicious! Service is quick, inexpensive and tasty! Let me also mention the hummus is OUT OF THIS WORLD good! And ask for the homemade hot sauce!"}
{"text":"So I dont know much about middle eastern food but I know good food when I taste it and boy was this food good. I stopped by this llace on a Sunday evening about 30min before closing and the staff were very nice. The cashier recommended the popular arabic shawarma plate. The resulting meal was delicious and the man who seemed to be In charge was even kind enough to show me a small bowl of herbs and how to chew them so I wouldnt have galic breathe as I left. it had. pleasant taste similar to black licorice.  All In all a good dining experience."}
{"text":"First time enjoying their food.  Delicious, delicious!! My daughter had a veggie sandwich and I had Chicken Shawarma.  The sandwiches were huge and tasty. I would go there again."}
{"text":"Chicken is awesome. The flavor and so tender. Next time I will try Shawarma chicken sandwich.  Very clean place. Very friendly. Definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"After having some amazing Mediterranean food in CA, we decided to give Shawarma King a try. I ordered the Shawarma Hummus Plate....which a plat of hummus surrounded by pita and a protein (I ordered chicken).   I can honestly say that the hummus was not to my liking....and the chicken was not that flavorful.  The rest of my party seemed to be fine with their food, but I am not sure I would try this again if in town (visiting).  Given the other Yelp reviews, maybe just a bad day"}
{"text":"One of the best Shawarmas I've had in America. In the deluxe option, they put fries in it as well which I've only had in the middle east. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Terrible shawarma I thought it was good so i drove 40 miles to eat it , I don't know why no one can make it not even closer like how it is in the Middle East!"}
{"text":"The chicken schwarma was quite tasty. I had a wrap with this very spicy - but tolerable - red sauce and a ton of garlic, so much garlic that toothpaste didn't help. 

The shop itself is small, there were 2 workers so service was a little slow as it seemed that only 1 would take orders and prepare food. They were out of beef and cups for water, which made me sad as I would have liked to try the beef. I hope they were out of stuff due to being busy, as I hope small businesses continue to grow. 

My friend tried the baklava but found it to be too dry, possibly old or previously frozen. Yet we all enjoyed the chicken. I'd go just for a plate of that. Prices were a little high for the platters, about 15, I'm not sure they were worth that much. My wrap was 8, I feel like I had more than enough food there. 

If I'm back in the area, I'd like to try the beef."}
{"text":"Decent food but the lady upfront had a terrible attitude. Get rid of her before your business goes down the drain. 

I have yet to have the beef shawerma because they are always out. I've been here 4 times and 4 times they've been out. They were out of beef shawerma, steak kabob and chicken kabob."}
{"text":"Best falafel in Arizona in my opinion. I am from a Middle Eastern background so I know good Middle Eastern food. These are out of this world. They are generous with the toppings and their bread is delicious. A delicious vegan sandwich awaits all vegans, vegetarians, and meat eaters. This is an amazing meal for everyone."}
{"text":"Let me tell you, I attempted to eat here a couple a months ago and I arrived when they had just received a massive order that wiped them out of beef for the evening. I was hurt. I had the opportunity to eat the beef shawarma plate today and I see why there was a massive order! Fresh and flavorful. My advice is get there early or give them a call. I don't believe you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Simply the best shawarma, humus and pita I have ever eaten! The portions are huge. Their vegetarian platter was great too. The owner was very welcoming and kind. I love this place."}
{"text":"Best falafel I've ever had. Fresh food laid back atmosphere. This will be a our new Mediterranean spot."}
{"text":"I have died and gone to shawarma heaven! The chicken shawarma plate is probably in my top 3 all time favorite meals. The chicken is bursting with flavor, the hummus is amazingly creamy, the rice is perfect...I could go on and on! 

The owner of Shawarma King is very nice, as well. Prices are great for the sheer amount of quality, delicious food you get.

If you are in the 43rd and Cactus area, you NEED to stop by. 

I would give 10 stars if possible!"}
{"text":"I taste tested the chicken shawarma and falafel and both were amazing.  I ordered the chicken shawarma pita and the flavor was insanely good.  The meat was tender with excellent use of spices.  The pita was rolled up and warm with wonderful seasonings.  I had the best chicken pita of my life.  Service was fast and friendly too.  I highly recommend a trip to this place.  Go NOW--it's that good."}
{"text":"I ordered the veggie feast plate and all I can say is AMAZING!!!! Ok, well maybe I can say more,,, Everything this place serves is made fresh and made to order when you order it and boy Oh Boy can you taste it, the flavor is just soooo good. Falafels were crispy on outside and moist and fluffy on inside just the way they should be (not dry) the hummus was so creamy and you can just taste it is the real deal and baba ganoush fire roasted fresh eggplant is to die for. I am so happy I have found this place it is a gem on this side of town.  Service was great too!"}
{"text":"Very good Arabic salad. Fresh ingredients and friendly service.
Wasn't a huge fan of the falafel but I'll be back to try more menu items."}
{"text":"Love, love LOVe. 
So excited to find this place! Light and fluffy falafel, great veggie platter and the pita....heavenly. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Stopped here on a VERY spontaneous whim and am actually glad I did.

Wasn't terribly han-gry but could use some body fuel to quiet the growing demon in my belly. Ordered Greek Salad and Hummus/Pita.

Total bill came to $15 something which seemed a tiny high but I didn't challenge.

LIked that the gentleman tossed my Greek salad (hee hee) right before my eyes. Buttt.... black (boring) canned olives?! What about Kalmata or something with a little bit of class? Smh

Flavors of salad were still great! Hummus and fresh, warm pita totally made up for the black olive no-no which just cheapens it. Probably 2nd best hummus I've ever done tried."}
{"text":"Good authentic stuff, gotten a bit pricey but still good. Falafel is great but definitely best fresh. Shawarma very tasty and some good salads in there as well."}
{"text":"The beef shawarma here is amazing, the texture of the pita bread was crispy/crunchy and I love crispy/crunchy textures. The meat is flavorful and to my amazement, moist and succulent. The flavor all around is pretty phenomenal, but the reason I gave it 4 out of 5 is due to the cost, which I understand why it cost more, better ingredients cost more money."}
{"text":"They had ran out of most things by the time we showed up here. I got the chicken shawarma special. It was really good. I can't wait to come back to this place and try their lamb/beef mix.

I give only 4 stars because they were out of everything. Hopefully i will be able to update this to 5 :)"}
{"text":"Really great food, fresh and healthy.  Love love love the hummus!  It is creamy and delicious with the pita.  However, I have been there twice when they were out of chicken shwarma and one time they were closed during their posted hours"}
{"text":"The original and best location. Unfortunately the owner doesn't work the counter as much anymore. But when he used to be there this would have easily been a 5 rating.

Still the best Shawarma in town!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  My husband and I come here quite often and have made it a goal to work through their menu, as each item we've tried has tasted great.  

We've always had wonderful, friendly service here, though we have had two occasions where an item we wanted to order at that time was unavailable because they ran out of a key ingredient (all of which are freshly made.)  It didn't trouble us though as there are plenty of other things to try, and we were able to try those items again at another visit.

I highly recommend the falafel.  I have falafel before at other locations that was too dry, hard, and gritty to be enjoyable, but not here.  It is just the right balance of crisp and tenderness."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch. Place was completely empty. The only guy that could speak English was on an extended break. When he returned, he treated me like I was keeping him from something far more important. I asked what was in the salad included in the plate, and he answered like I asked him the dumbest question ever. I also asked what was in the salad dressing, and he said he didn't know. I have food allergies that require an Epinephrine injection, so this wasn't a joke. If one is going to be in the restaurant industry, one should be sensitive to such things.

Also noticed that they had shaved off the shawarma meat ahead of time and it was in metal containers at the base of each shawarma stack. I don't know how long it had been sitting in the container, but it was moved to the steam table after Mr Attitude came back from his break. It was VERY DRY. Thankfully, I did not get sick. Given the attitude, I don't think I'll be back. 

The falafel was ok. The garlic sauce, the obviously freshly made pita bread and hummus were excellent."}
{"text":"Definitely agree with other reviewers here. Best falafel I have ever tasted. I am now probably ruined for anyone else's falafel sandwich. Light, fluffy, and moist, not like the dense, dry balls that you sometimes get.You are also offered choices that are just not offered in other places - things like beet pickles and spicy sauce in addition to the usual tahini, cucumber, tomato, etc. Really elevated my sandwich beyond the ordinary. Guy behind the counter was super friendly too. Even came over and offered me a fresh falafel patty while I was waiting for the sandwich. When I remarked on how good it was, he said it was because they make it fresh... Guy obviously takes pride in his quality work. Well done. can't wait to return and try... Everything else on the menu."}
{"text":"I can't believe I FINALLY found it!!  What a gem of a middle eastern grub spot! And who would of thought right here in Glendale, Az. Everything is prepared fresh daily and is without a doubt a serious WOW factor. The lady and her husband who own the place moved out here from New York and brought the REAL DEAL here to Az, if you have a love for Middle Eastern food GO HERE IMMEDIATELY. There is not a bite of food in here that won't blow you away! And it's a huge bonus that the owners are Extremely nice people. I have tried and tried over and over to find a Middle Eastern spot to this level and have given up my search many times do to the non-stop let downs I've had thru the years here in Az. And don't come in here asking for a gyro this place doesn't serve the middle eastern equivalent to \"hot dog meat\". Follow the description in the name \"SHAWARMA KING\" and get yourself a shawarma..... the crown which they rightfully hold is well deserved!  Oh and for the Vegetarian's don't worry you are about to experience THE BEST FALAFEL YOU HAVE EVER HAD! and they don't leave you with one option THE BREAD , THE HUMMUS, THE ARABIC SALAD, THE RED CABBAGE SALAD, THE MEDITERRANEAN SALAD....IT JUST DOESNT END, GET READY TO SLAP YOURSELF IN THE FACE ITS SO GOOD, each bite you have will leave you craving to return as soon as possible.  Oh and another bonus is the Hibiscus drink it is also homemade and has the perfect balance of sweet, sour and floral! Plus it is extremely healthy and is wonderful for kidney detoxification! So what are you waiting for, get up and stop your search for food HERE RIGHT NOW TODAY and you will find a place to eat EVERY DAY!"}
{"text":"Stay away from this place. There's a lot of good Arabic food in the valley. Honestly the food is Ok, but customer services is Horrible!! If u read some responses from the owner (angry lady) u can tell HOW rude this lady and the way they running their business. This Resturant will be out of business one day!!!! BTW, My review forward to BBB in Phoenix ."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! DELICIOUS! DELICIOUS! The chicken shawarma was juicy and tender. The hummus was some of the best I've had."}
{"text":"Horrible chicken shawarma with dark meat and a large chunk of fat right inside my sandwich. The beef shawarma was hard like beef jerky. Just all around two thumbs down. $21 for 2 shawarma sandwiches and mind you, they put cheese inside of a shawarma sandwich. That's totally not authentic."}
{"text":"The chicken shawarma deluxe was very good! The service was excellent! Will definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"First time going here tonight and had the shawarma plate. Can't believe that I demolished the entire thing!  The chicken was delicious, as was the saffron rice.  The hummus is excellent, and their house made pita bread is fantastic.  My only complaint is that I live to far. Staff is friendly and the atmosphere is quaint.  I highly recommend coming here for great Mediterranean style food."}
{"text":"Quick friendly service and the food was awesome!  I moved to the area from the the Detroit, MI area and this tops anything I had there.  Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Have been wanting to try this place for a while now and finally did today. This place's reviews are spot on! We ordered a chicken wrap, 3 chicken pitas, falafel, and hummus. The chicken had an awesome flavor and just as the reviews say-the falafel was awesome! I also likes the hummus-good flavor and our boys really liked the pita bread-the pitas are nice and soft, a bit different than I am used to but in a good way. On top of everything, I met the owner who was very warm and welcoming. My family and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I wanna give 3 because the food are very good 
But the customer service is horrible the lady at the cashier ( she the owner) has very bad attitude 
She makes you feel she is doing you a favor by taking your order 
My little kid said hi to her , she pretended did not see him and was very cold and unfriendly"}
{"text":"Shawarma King is the best for Mediterranean food. I come here all the time. Great quality food and clean all the way around. I drive over 15 miles just for this restaurants food. I also love how much how the meat is halal."}
{"text":"well I am from Arabian country so I know the real test of the shawarma.. in this place you gonna find the best shawarma in US without any doubt!! I really love it and thanks to the beautiful lady in the cashier ^^

can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"I am not a Mediterranean food fan in general. Looking at gyro meat and pita bread does not make me hungry. But this place, is not that. The meat shawarma is delicious. I loved that it was crispy on the outside. They add what I think was cream cheese to it. I havent stopped thinking about it!"}
{"text":"Yes! Ahhhhh love shawarma! Had the lamb beef shawarma sandwich. If you want to know what the wraps are like in the middle east and Greece then come here. Food is authentic. No gyro meat here yuck! Just layers of lamb and beef cooked on a spit."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've ever come here. Is absolutely for delicious. The tortillas are so soft. But crunchy. I highly recommend a place."}
{"text":"This is a GREAT option for middle eastern food in Phoenix. We moved here from Michigan where there is a large population of middle eastern folks, and some great m.e restaurants. Shawarma King can rival the best of them! Falafels are my fav there- crisp on outside, soft on inside. The salads are amazing, yummy crispy pita, huge wraps, everything I've ordered there has been bomb! The only reason I gave 4 stars is that a few times I have wanted to order and they have been \"out of food\" which is really disappointing when craving some shawarma! Really friendly staff. Great authentic flavors."}
{"text":"Second time here and they sold out of the beef shawarma so they must be doing something right, so I ordered the chicken shawarma again with their new zesty garlic sauce and it was delicious! Got to come earlier next time to try the beef shawarma. Both owners prepare everything in plain view so you know it's fresh!"}
{"text":"Great food, generous portions, & the place looks great for a little strip mall lunch spot. The only thing missing is a sexy bellydancer"}
{"text":"This place has the best sandwich I have ever had. The service was one of the best i have also ever had. Not to often you get the cook that would step out from around the kitchen to check on the customers to see how the food turned out and if you liked it. This place gets a 10 for service and food."}
{"text":"Ugh!! Took 2 bites and threw the rest away. It was drowning in the sauce that was way too strong. Even the fries sucked, bland and mushy. I would NEVER go back."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been on a serious search for falafel since our New York trip 4 years ago.  No one has quite stacked up to those delicious little chickpea balls served from food carts.  
New yorkers, the food you get just walking down the streets is a gift.   An absolute gift.  You be grateful.
But I digress.  After many failed attempts we have finally found a that little piece of heaven and so much more.
The falafel here is on point.  On. Point.  The shawarma is freaking awesome, too.  The place in clean, the service is friendly and quick, and the prices a fair.  
All good.
But that falafel is GREAT.  So glad to finally have a go to falafel joint!"}
{"text":"Walked in not expecting much and to my surprise it was a very clean and nice restaurant.  I was greeted with a big smile and welcome which was pleasant.  Since they are called Shawarma King I figured I try the Shawarma and see if it's as good as the stuff I had back in the middle east.  When I saw the menu, I realized shawarma wasn't going to be the only thing I was ordering.  Me and the lady ended up ordering shawarma, falafel, hummus and the special of the day which was mansef.  The food was all amazing and super delishhhh... My taste buds were in heaven.  The falafel was a crispy golden brown and not over cooked, the hummus was creamy yummy and the shawarma/mansaf was as good as your going to find here or the middle east! We were so full we didn't have room for the delicious looking desert - Next time! The owners are the ones serving you which is always pleasant and makes you feel good supporting a small local business. A nice change from the widely available Mexican, American, Chinese and italian food all around us.  We plan to make this a once a week stop and that's only because we live on the other side of town!"}
{"text":"Love their food, we got the veggie platter, hummus, salads, falafel balls and pita. It was delicious, we wanted to try to shawarma but they run out of the meat. I wish they can be close to my home."}
{"text":"Great experience & delicious lunch!  I had falafel & chicken schwarma salad.  Both were great."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great falafel or shawarma sandwich this place is the best of the best. Everything here tastes home made and fresh, like water for chocolate . This restaurant is always impeccably clean. Their falafel is so perfect, crispy on the outside soft on the inside! And they have the best hummus I've ever had with their soft bread which is made fresh it makes the perfect combo. I absolutely love their food."}
{"text":"Growing up in the Middle East knowing what a shawerma is supposed to taste, I've finally can say I found a place in usa that serves with the quality and recipe! Awesome"}
{"text":"Unfortunately this place is almost always out of something.  Not things like ketchup either,  I can't tell you how many times I've called and they have no schwarma, or pita, or hummus. However,  I update to two stars because when they actually have everything it is great food."}
{"text":"Absolutely no flavor. I ordered chicken shawarma sandwich and everything tasted the same = no flavor. Everyone who's saying that it's flavorful, they probably never had real shawarma. I took few bites and couldn't finish because it was bland."}
{"text":"Extremely satisfied with the quality and cleanliness of this place. 
We order the Arabic salad, and 2 Syrian falafel sandwiches.  I also got the Jamaica (hibiscus drink) which they apologized for not sweetening enough, but I loved it.

Everything was made fresh in front of us, and they were constantly cleaning as they made food.

I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"This place is extremely amazing. It's clean, service is perfect, and the people working here were nice. The food was incredible."}
{"text":"Great food at a reasonable price.  The owner is one of the nicest guys around.  Worth driving to from anywhere in the valley.  Flat out one of the best food spots in Arizona."}
{"text":"The best hummus in Phoenix. Period. 

Smooth and tasty; Shawarma King shield have been more appropriately named \"Hummus King\" as this delicious little GEM of a restaurant are the masters of their craft when it comes to middle Eastern magic in your mouth.  

The hummus here will put the popular Pita Jungle to shame as there is no comparison! The mealy bland and tasteless garbanzo dip at pita jungle might be fine, but anyone seeking true middle eastern BLISS need to come and check out Shawarma King to rediscover the nuances and delicate smoothness and flavors without buying airfare to Lebanon or Israel. Amazing. 

Another huge plus here: some of the most delicate, melt in your mouth pillow soft HOME MADE pita bread you've ever tasted. Piping Hot out of the oven, the taste again here is heaven on earth yummy and paired with the hummus (with a dab of their spicy Jalapeño sauce in the middle) you will be floored at the quality and exquisite taste. Nothing else in the valley holds a candle to this. 

I've also had the Arabic salad here which had a nice mix of ripe tomatoes, cucumbers and Tahina (with the jalapeño) and even in its simplicity this salad amazes. 

The chicken Shawarma is nicely seasoned and tender. 
 
Prices here are a little higher then you might expect for a strip center middle eastern joint near metro center. But I can assure you that the deliciously fresh and quality ingredients at Shawarma King far surpass anything you've tried in this valley. The interior of the place is spotless, and the chef owner (and his wife) seem passionate about their food. 

Tops in the valley. 

I've been here 5 times at least, and this is a five star experience without a doubt."}
{"text":"Food was decent but customer service is lacking. Ordered a chicken shawarma but received a beef shawarma. Went to the cashier about it and argued I ordered the beef. He said look at your receipt but I told him he never gave me one in the first place."}
{"text":"WOW!!!!!!!!!  Went yesterday for the first time and this gem exceeded all my expectations! A friend and I both had the Chicken Shawarma plate which came with hummus (fantastic), small green salad (all fresh ingredients...even use persian cucumbers, my personal favorite), basmati rice (well flavored and perfectly cooked)  and of course, the Shawarma....delicious and perfectly flavored with subtle tastes that left me wanting more.  Plate came with sides of freshly made pita (made there and they sell it too) and a dollop of thick greek yoghurt.  
We also had an appetizer of falafel with tahini which was good too but with the portions of the main dish,  made us stuffed, but exceedingly satisfied.

Menu is simple, straight forward and the owners are friendly and genuine.  The dining area of the restaurant is clean and the kitchen is open for all to see and it is immaculate.

GO!  GO THERE NOW!"}
{"text":"Extremely polite owners and very good quality food. Try the cheese bourek and any of the shawrma combos. Good salad seasoning , and amazing baba ghanoush. Def coming back for my Mediterranean fix"}
{"text":"Hummus is amazing. First time trying this place and I'm going back today to get more hummus and gonna try falafel this time."}
{"text":"I came here after we got a recommendation from a friend that works at Sam Ash next door. I came when they opened and unfortunately the beef/lamb shawarma wasn't ready yet  I decided to wait. While I was waiting the cook came by and served p me free falafel for my wait. The service is great, the food amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Good food.  The meat platter is delicious yet a bit pricey.  I was limited to a meat choice but that's ok, that's all I wanted.  My only complaint was the kid who helped me. Zero excitement and no greeting."}
{"text":"This going to be my favorite Mediterranean place to eat! I had a veggie wrap which was huge & delicious! My companions both had the chicken shawarmadilla and they took 1/2 home because the portions were huge. The prices are super reasonable & the owner is very friendly! The atmosphere is casual & you order at the register then pick up your meal. They are busy with takeout orders. The only issue was their drink machine was out of order so I didn't get any tea. The hibiscus punch was just a bit too sweet for us."}
{"text":"They get one star for customer service. I visited the place three times, the first time the woman owner was rude to me. I gave her the benefit of the doubt and i thought she might be having a bad day. I visited again and she was mean again, I was like maybe there is something wrong. The third time she was just mean, rude and disrespectful. The man owner is nice, i seriously don't understand why she was rude to me. I ordered from the menu with no changes made and i was polite and said please.
I will not go there again because of her attitude, Why would i pay my money for someone who don't respect me as a customer."}
{"text":"This place is outta this world! Amazing food, great price! Service is outstanding. Love this place. The fries are cooked perfectly. The shawarma is on point. Can't wait to get hungry again and come back to grub."}
{"text":"This is hands down some of the best food I have had in Phoenix in a long, long time.  Every meal is fantastic and incredibly tasty!"}
{"text":"great yummyness in the wee hours

nom nom nom"}
{"text":"Ever since we moved to Arizona from the Philippines, we've been looking for a decent Shawarma place. We have tried and failed til we came across Shawarma King, and boy were we satisfied! Love their fresh pita bread and hummus as well. Will come again for sure"}
{"text":"Our meals were fabulous!  The flavors of each and every item on the Chicken Shawarma Plate and Chicken Kabob Plate were outstanding.  A nice variety of offerings on the plate and each taste blended and maximized each surrounding bite.  Our food took awhile to be prepared but the owner apologized sincerely.  From the first bite I was in heaven-and scheduling my next return visit."}
{"text":"The place was empty and I always drive by it. Well me and the wife stopped by. It was extremely clean and me and the gentleman who was working had some common ground considering we are both Arab lol. Anyways the food was really tastey. But the portion makes you wish you ordered another. It is kinda small(maybe I just love huge portions) and the price was too much for me to order that again. It's more a once in a while place for me I suppose. Go there and you won't be disappointed by the flavor and food euphoria it may make you feel."}
{"text":"The food was great. Obviously if you don't like Shawarma or you don't like trying new things you shouldn't go here. For the rest of us, the quality is great and the staff was helpful."}
{"text":"Best Falafel and hummus I've ever had, it was so good and fresh. Will definitely visit them again soon to try the shawarma."}
{"text":"Stopped into this place for a bite for dinner. Had the falafel and chicken shawarma. The food was awesome and big portions. Very clean and inviting little place. This is the place to go !!"}
{"text":"Been here several times each time had something different and it's all very good, with such a wide variety it's rare for a place to make everything taste amazing. I'm pregnant and live two city's over and still make my boyfriend bring me. It's definitely worth the drive and the cost!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Fresh, fresh, fresh everything. They are doing it right at this place.
My only minus is when we ordered 2 sandwiches, one with no onions, they didn't put onions on both. I shouldn't be punished because my husband is bland and doesn't like onions, hehe!"}
{"text":"Another place in the valley that advertises closing at 8pm which is early enough, but doors were locked when I got there at 7:50. The person working there didn't even bother to come up to the door to explain why they closed earlier than advertised. He just sneered at me from the kitchen.

************************

UPDATE: Today I received the following private message from Shawarma King. As you can see, it says quite a lot about how they view their customers. Rather than address why they closed early last night or why he or another worker didn't bother coming up to the door to explain, he simply wrote the following:

Hahahahaha you funny:)"}
{"text":"As a middle eastern woman I give them 5 stars on their food .. clean..customer service .. i dont have to wait too long... my daughter loves their food ...I recommend shawerma king for Mediterranean food"}
{"text":"Funny, clever and interesting crew at this house of Shawarma with a delectable palate of food to accompany such characters.  Well done!"}
{"text":"The Shawarmas were good.  I had my first shawarma in Saudi Arabia and I have not been able to find a taste quite as delicious as that.  For that reason alone I rate Shawarma King 3 stars.  I did feel a little unwelcomed when I first walked in, but my order was taken with a smile and the food arrive quickly and hot.  I will be back there again."}
{"text":"The best shawarma in town and the food was so amazing so I give them 5 starts, I will for sure coming back"}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal! The only other shwarma place I've ever been to closed, so I went in search of a new place. The restaurant is super clean, you can watch them plate your food and cut the meat. The falafel is incredible, too, and the owner is super friendly. Given that it's a new business, even the prices are pretty decent. The only reason this doesn't get five stars for me is because there wasn't enough meat for my taste, but I definitely wasn't left hungry with everything else on the plate. I would 100% recommend this to anyone!"}
{"text":"Best hummus is town! These guys know their stuff. The pita bread is also amazing. I wish they would serve more then one pita per hummus dish, as one is not enough. Really good place to enjoy the authentic middle eastern dish."}
{"text":"The middle eastern place in my town (Charlotte, NC) is fresher & better quality. This is definately Americanized,  but it had a good flavor. I'm not sure if I would recommend it for someone craving middle eastern food especially if they've had authentic before. But if you don't know the difference it's good."}
