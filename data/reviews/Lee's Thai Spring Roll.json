{"text":"Very good food and great service. They surely do must have one great chef there!!!! Phat Thai was very good and so was the green curry chicken!!"}
{"text":"On a rainy Friday night, my boyfriend and I decided to go out and grab some food.  We'd had our second date at the Queen Street location and he had always raved about this location. Our dinner was great.  We had springrolls - yummy sauce and not too deep-fried tasting, curry pad thai and green curry chicken. It was tasty, though the curry pad thai could have used a little more curry.  We had a lovely time and will definitely be back.   Plus, I sort of love the odd lights in the floor."}
{"text":"I ordered spring rolls, cold spring rolls, and a curry pad thai.  The spring rolls were okay, but a little greasy.  The curry pad thai bland and the cold spring rolls were stuffed full of lettuce. It's the only thing you could taste.    With so many Thai options in the city, I wouldn't order from here again. The experience was below average at best."}
{"text":"Love the curry pad Thai! I'm a frequent customer."}
{"text":"I would comment on the food if I ever got any.  I ordered delievery at 9pm, at 1030pm I was worried they had forgotten about us! I called and they told me they are having trouble finding my house, so they asked me for my address again.  Okay, at 11pm, still no food. So I called again, this is now 2 hours after ordering. I asked them what the issue was, they said the driver was right outside my house, nope. I called back again, it was obvious that they were not coming. I asked for a refund, the lady told me her boss said he will give me 5 dollars off, I considered that an insult and asked for a refund again.  The next day the refunded my card, and I ended up going out for wings...ewww.  Disaster."}
{"text":"Pad Thai is a pretty simple order: one with chicken, one just vegetarian. I loved that she thought to ask if egg was okay in the vegetarian.  The vegetarian pad thai was tasty. The chicken pad thai HAD A STAPLE IN IT. wth?   Will not go back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Great food, great staff and such a nice restaurant atmosphere. I picked up pad thai, peanut chicken and spring rolls and everything was delicious. This isn't the first time I ordered and I've been really happy every time."}
{"text":"My favourite Thai place in the city, because of their Cashew Nut Chicken. Seriously, the best I've ever tasted, and I've travelled all over Thailand looking for something better. So good.  Super fast take out, friendly service, and a lot of yummy stuff on the menu. You want Thai food in Parkdale? You come here."}
{"text":"Tasty, tasty, tasty. Oh yes - 3 tasty's, that's how good it is. Thai food is known for it's bright and fragrant flavours, but this place just takes it up to another level. I crave their Basil Chicken and Pad Thai (my stomach is gurgling from just writing this review)."}
{"text":"After a hard few hours of skating, or rather, wobbling around the outdoor skating rink at Colonel Samuel Smith Park, we randomly stumbled into Lee's dreaming of warming, spicy soup just as the snow was starting to drift down for the evening.  I'm so glad that we wandered through these doors!  The restaurant of dark decor, red covered tables, stone tiled walls and funky coloured floor lights with some hopping music certainly set an interesting atmosphere.  It was empty and continued to be empty from the time we came in at 5:30 until we left.  However, during that entire time, there was a steady stream of people dropping in to pick up their orders and the servers were continuously on the phone taking orders.  I would say that this place is pretty popular with the locals!  We ordered the hot and sour soup, the red curry chicken, the red curry lamb and the pineapple fried rice.  The soup was loaded with goodies, with tofu, chicken, bamboo shoots and lots of veggies.  It was just spicy enough for an average-spicy tolerance person like me.  So flavourful!  We couldn't get enough of the curry and towards the end, I was sorely tempted to drink up the curry remaining.  I really enjoyed the food at this place!  The service was prompt and very friendly.  The washrooms are single stalled for each gender and very roomy and clean.  Credit cards are accepted.  For the locals in the know, I'm guessing the reason why there are so many take out and delivery orders is because there is a 10% discount on all cash pick ups, and any order over $20 has free delivery.   I would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Great Thai food, the dine in experience is very nice and relaxed. Delivery is good as well, it's always been pretty quick. It's the first place I think of when ordering in for Thai food"}
{"text":"I have to say that I was a bit disappointed with my most recent takeout order. I've been happy with past visits, but tonight's cold rolls didn't taste fresh and the pad thai noodles were all congealed and stuck together. Basil chicken was great as usual. I'll need to go back and give them another chance."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a 4 star simply because their food is de-LICIOUS but that new waitress is HORRIBLE. There was a party of 6 of us and she managed to have to take our orders 3 times over, messed up 2 of them, had to be asked a few times for water and tea, gave us fried spring rolls instead of cold ones, and forgot all about our side orders of rice. If it wasn't for the fact that the food that comes out of the kitchen is enough to make you forget all about this bumbling girl, the experience would have probably been a complete write off. I hope she's new. Please god let her be new."}
{"text":"MY favourite Thai joint.  I find that they charge about $1 more than most - but the quality of the food is certainly better quality and the seasoning is perfect.  My particular favourite:  cold spring rolls. They are flavourful and crunchy as it should be, not wrapped in aged green romain lettice - with so little stuffing that you cannot taste anything but the lettice. I only know of 2 Thai spots that make the cold spring rolls this way and this is one of them.  I recommand their Thai tea in the summer it does wonders.  The ambiance of the restaurant is calm, casual and intimate - perfect for a date or just eating out with a friend."}
{"text":"I have been to this place with my friend based on all the great reviews I saw!! the space is cute with the red chairs and it was cool that it did not play loud hip hop beats for once while sitting and enjoying some great food. I've been to other Asian places before that played z103.5 as loud as the speaker could go while you're supposed to eat curry and soup.                                      off to the service - 10/10  there were two tables in the whole restaurant however the girl took care of delivery orders and setup side work etc but she was verry seeet chatty and fun and very attentive. she answered all the questions i had before chosing my dish.  I had the sweet and sour soup that was so huge for 5 bucks it could've fed 3 people easily and it was loaded with tofu and had a good taste and spices.( i will go to this location to eat just a bowl of that on cold days for sure)   and my entree consissted of  beef in green curry.  it was good and the vegies were steamed but still crunchy and full of flavour and not overwhelmed by the coconut milk and spices. definetely an amazing chef there as i ate other coconut sauces that made me feel so sick after ... from lee's i just want more yummy food!!!'  the prices are very reasonable  for the gigantic portions 10-15 for entree and with soup and a pop i paid like 20$  and i left a happy yelper!!"}
{"text":"Very tasty Thai/Malaysian fusion. I recommend the peanut chicken/beef or mango chicken."}
{"text":"Beautiful, classy little spot just on Lake Shore near Islington.  The only menu item I can comment on is the Curry Pad Thai (with chicken) because that's all I ever order and it's outstanding.  The chicken is very well-seasoned and curry they use is definitely a lot different from any other I've tasted.  It's a very complex, spicy dish and noodles are never dry, even when I go to heat up the leftovers the next day."}
{"text":"Always love this place - I think the food is great and the service when the good staff is on, is fantastic.  I highly recommend it - but let's not make it too crowded so that I can't get in..."}
{"text":"I came here based on these rave Yelp reviews and was a bit disappointed. A friend and I ordered the appetizer plate, as we weren't too hungry... It came with spring rolls, fish cakes, rice paper vegetable rolls, satay shrimp and mango salad. That sounds like a lot, but we got 2-3 of each item. The mango salad and satay shrimp were quite good, but the rest were mediocre.  Service was friendly, but not that great. Even though the restaurant was dead, our appetizer went to the wrong table before it came to us, and then the server couldn't tell us what sauce it came with.  That appetizer plate plus jasmine tea came to $25. Pretty overpriced.  Full disclosure: I have high standards for Thai cuisine (as we all should, lol)."}
{"text":"Not too impressed. We came in just after 9pm, they asked us if we wanted to sit to take out, then realized the time and said, \"well, you can take out...\" I had the Basil chicken, not too much flavour and was very put off when I bit into a chunk of chicken neck. Never mind my teeth, but just completely lost my appetite. My wife's Tum Yum Gai was not flavourful, there wasn't much substance either. Not going to go back. They were quick, but it showed in the quality of the food. The interior seemed nice, but didn't get a chance to enjoy."}
