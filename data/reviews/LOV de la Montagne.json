{"text":"The food is pretty good, if not slightly bland. When it's busy, the service is slower than anything I've been subjected to recently. It took almost 55 minutes from the time we were seated to have our order taken."}
{"text":"I rarely leave positive reviews and I'm seriously hard to please having worked in fine dining in the old port and having come across my fair share of unpleasant restaurant staff and/or bad food quality.

Came here to grab a bite with a friend before our movie - we showed up at 5 the restaurant was almost empty and they sat us right away after making sure we are okay with leaving before 7 because they had reservations.

The decor is beautiful, the waitress was very pleasant and I for a second thought we would get a snobby waitress experience but not at all every employee seemed very down to earth. We ordered the mac n cheese, the poutine and the club lov to share. Every single dish was delicious way beyond my expectations of vegan food. 

Little attentions like various staff members refilling our glasses with water every time they had a chance to the manager coming by our table once we received our food to wish us a great meal - every little detail was on point. I think the biggest winners for me were the taste of the food which was splendid and the friendly attitude of the staff. I can't stress enough how way too many restaurants in montreal make you feel unwelcomed and snob you unless you fit into their idea of a high-end customer.

We felt welcomed and at ease and it was overall such a good experience I can't wait to come back with more people. Kudos!"}
{"text":"An excellent restaurant for vegan/vegetarian food, though it is on the pricier side with one of the cheapest options being a veggie burger for 14$. However, the prices are reflected in the quality of the food, and the fact that they carefully select their ingredients. Vegan cheese is offered as a substitute for all choices in which there is cheese, and milk substitutes are available for their drinks. In regards to the food, the veggie burger was satisfying and tasty. I enjoyed the vegan poutine, though the vegan cheese we ordered with it (instead of cheese curds) didn't melt, but organic cheese is an option if this is something that concerns you. The interior decor is very nice and the patio is pleasant, and the servers were attentive and friendly. Overall it is a nice vegan/veggie restaurant that is the perfect blend between casual and classy."}
{"text":"Tried both locations, and La Montagne is our favorite, just because of the space. Otherwise they both delivered the perfect experience (one star lost for the uninspired dessert though, sorry, we are demanding).

- The decor is what strikes you first of course. It's light, playful, refreshing; elaborate and curated but not taking itself seriously, like the food.
- The food is on point. It's not a vegan restaurant that hides its preference, or a baba cool hippie from the 60's with only grain dishes. Each dish has it's own flavor and texture; inventive, satisfying, good proportions and careful presentation. May be the dessert was the disappointment (hence the lost star) as it was not up to par with the rest of the meal. Don't tell your carnivore friends it's vegan, and they will still be satisfied.
- The service was nice and easy. They may be trendy and full, but they still have a smile each time they interact, and they take their time with you. You don't feel rushed and the service is friendly without being unprofessional.

A very rounded experience - the price is right, for a well delivered and executed experience. It's an experience that makes you smile and be happy, like the decor."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our brunch and will return.
A couple of notes:  our waiter was really new and did not seem to know much about the menu or have answers to our questions.
Also, eggs Benedict cold, didn't seem right.
Breakfast potatoes far too spicy."}
{"text":"One of the best Restaurants, I have had food at, which apparently happens to be a vegan place. If you live in Montreal or visiting, this is a must go to place 

The place is new, but has a character to it. Lob has a combination of white and green looks ( white furniture and green plants) which is refreshing. Ambiance,music and people are wonderful. 

Food is very tasty, if you are a connoisseur, you can make out the subtle flavours that come from varies herbs used. The portion of food is good. Two of us visited, we orders a started, a snack and one main dish, which was too much for us( had to ask for a take out box). 

I will strongly recommend this place, specially to meat lovers, this is a good place to eat Vegan"}
{"text":"I have been a vegetarian for years and am always looking for new places to try, so when visiting Montreal Restaurant LOV seemed like an obvious choice. My friend and I walked in just before 6pm on a Saturday night. The restaurant was maybe a third full, but we were informed that no tables were available without a reservation and they gave us a bar spot. The bar was very crowded, to the point of being uncomfortable. The restaurant atmosphere and aesthetic were very nice, it reminded me a bit of Planta in Toronto for a variety of reasons. The food is a little pricey for what it is, but given the restaurant aesthetic it is acceptable. What really hindered our experience was the service. Our waitress/the bartender was not helpful, and a bit rude. When asking what the soup of the day is she responded that she didn't know. When further pressing asking if it was perhaps salty or sour, she responded that she still did not know. When asking about a salad recommendation, she told us that she had no preference. I ended up getting the Mexican salad, and my friend got a small house salad and the mystery soup of the day (we are still unsure of what was in it!) My salad was very tasty and actually quite filling, but with tip came out to nearly $20 which is excessive for a salad IMO. My friend also enjoyed her meal, but the slice of bread she was given with her soup was a tad stale. Overall the food is decently good and the restaurant aesthetic is lovely, but the service and high prices make me not want to return."}
{"text":"Very good vegan food with a few vegetarian additions, beautiful decor and kind service:"}
{"text":"Maybe Id rate this higher if I was a vegetarian but I found what I ordered to be very average. I got the Kale mac and cheese as a starter and the Lov Burger as a main. Both were very average in my opinion. Although prices were reasonable considering the location and how nice the place is."}
{"text":"Delicious vegan food and beautiful decor!

I visited Montreal in October, and LOV was at the top of my list of restaurants to check out. I visited the Old Montreal location for dinner on a rainy night. It wasn't crowded when I arrived, and I didn't have a reservation, but it soon started to fill up. The first thing I noticed when I walked through the door is the restaurant's beautiful decor - it's light, airy, rustic, and botanical. Even the bathroom was decorated beautifully.

My server was really nice and helpful, which I greatly appreciated since I only speak a little French. I ordered a lemonade while I looked over the menu. There were so many vegan options that it took me a while to decide what to order! After much deliberation, I started with the Kale Mac'n'Cheese. I don't always like vegan Mac'n'Cheese, but LOV's version was really yummy! The kale added a nice flavor to it. For my entree, I chose the Gnocchi Di Casa, which came coated in a hemp basil pesto and almond parmesan. It was my first ever experience with gnocchi, and it was truly delicious! The gnocchi were like little pillows packed with flavor. Even though I was just about full, I couldn't pass up dessert, so I ordered a vegan chocolate cupcake to end the meal on a sweet note.

LOV is a nice restaurant that I would go to for a special occasion or on a date. If I ever make it back to Montreal, I will definitely dine at LOV again!"}
{"text":"Ok guys ! If u live in Montreal u know that there isn't  that much variety when u talk about vegan restaurants. 
So I started my vegan journey couple weeks ago and believe me , finding a good restaurant where u can eat safely and good vegan foods are RARE in MTL. But I found this one , and excuse my French je suis sur le cul! 
I writing my review on my second visit ! Oh la la , loved everything I ate so far! The combination are weird, unexpected but so good! 
From entr√©es to the courses every pieces are ridiculously delicious and the best part is everything are affordable. So for people like me who like foods and hate to cook, here's a place to keep in favorite place to go."}
{"text":"The description of Lov de Montagne, \"Health-conscious dining with a gourmet culinary experience, in a laid-back and elegant atmosphere.\" captures well the experience dining there. The bright white decor is stylish yet warm, the staff friendly, attentive and helpful and the food  excellent. We ate here two consecutive nights while visiting Montreal and would gladly return.
 
Salads are fresh, using locally sourced ingredients. There are numerous options for other items, including starters, sides and  sandwiches, though we opted both nights for a main course. In particular, we loved their Urban mushrooms, which used oyster mushrooms accompanied by zucchini, pearly onions, fresh peas and a delicious sauce. They wisely provide a soup spoon as no way you will leave a drop of the sauce behind. We had their brownie (gluten free) for desert and it was quite tasty but also light.
 
They have an extensive drink menu though we stayed with their nice selection of wines."}
{"text":"I have been several times for dinner at both locations. Always admire the decor and love the ambiance. It is a warm feeling when you step inside the main doors. This weekend was my first time I tried Lov for brunch and I was excited to see what's on the menu. It was a beautiful sunny day and my friend and I asked to sit out on the terasse. The servers were nice about it when we asked to move to another table in order to get the most sun. There are a few tables outside on the terasse which can fit 2 or 4 people if they are put together. The tables are too close beside one another and the next table can hear your entire conversation. So if are loud talkers, perhaps you should ask for a more table in the corner. There are also 2 picnic tables which can hold 4-6 people comfortably if evenly spaced out. We were bit squished when a trio arrived and sat in the middle. They were practically sitting on our laps, which was not the most comfortable. 

I opted for the waffle with vegan yogurt and chai seed coulis and an order of the vegan smoked onion sausage. Finished both easily. There was nothing unique about the waffle, it was fine. Although, the sausages were flavorful and the texture was soft. 

They stop serving brunch at 3 p.m. and start turning away customers as they are turning over and getting ready for the evening service.  I'm glad I tried it, although I prefer Lov for dinner."}
{"text":"Ok here is the deal, Lov is a beautiful restaurant with gorgeous decor, a nice vibe, and \"good enough\" tasting food. I also loved the attention and care of the staff and additional points for a convenient downtown location! 

However, I must admit that they fall very short when it comes to food portions/quality compared to pricing. Maybe I have a bigger appetite than most, maybe I'm cheap and maybe I expect a lot from a brunch 
( how can you not with all the different amazing brunch choices in Montreal and it's brunch, it's supposed to be filling and uber satisfying ), but It just didn't cut it for me.

I ordered a Jasmine tea ( $3, usually tea or coffee is included or cheaper in other restaurants), then took the vegan omelet for  ( $10 ) which on top of being small only came with a salad, no other sides ( just salad leaves and cherry tomatoes, where are my potatoes, bread or fruits?? ) + a side of fruits ( $3 ).  Since neither I or my friend ( who took eggs benedict ) were full, we ordered the Apple pancakes ( $14 ) to share. These were supposed to come in 3, but they only served us 2 because supposedly the ones they usually serve were smaller in size ( baffling as the pancakes they served were actually small ). On top of this, there were no apples or applesauce included. Granted after I explained this to them, they made me another batch of 2 pancakes on the house.

All in all, while the experience and food weren't the worst, the impression I have of Lov is that they target the type of crowd who cares more about appearance then actual substance. As someone who is vegan, I really find such places annoying because it confirms the stereotype that eating a plant-based diet is unaffordable and unsatisfying when it really isn't.

Lastly, upon placing the reservation, there is a section to mention an occasion, I indicated that it was my birthday and there was no acknowledgment of this - In that case, what's the point of asking to specify an occasion?!

All in all, I would not go back to Lov unless they reconsider their portions/quality to be more in alignment with their prices.

For a great vegan brunch in Montreal, I would recommend Aux Vivres!"}
{"text":"A friend was in town and told me she was looking for \"something healthy\", so we decided to try this place out. The overall experience was all-good, but nothing particularly amazing or worth coming back for. 

The first myth I want to address is that this is a \"healthy\" restaurant. It really isn't. I mean other than ordering a salad, which you can get anywhere, most of the other options aren't healthy (when was the last time a burger was healthy!?). The second myth is that this is a vegan restaurant. As my friend and I found out, there were many items on the menu that were vegan, but others not. So if you are strictly vegan, make sure you order accordingly. 

I had a salad while my friend the burger. Both meals were good, but nothing special. 

I have to admit everything else though. was lovely. The space is beautiful and has a lovely terrace in the summer. The service is also quite good.  

Another consideration is that there aren't that many good options for a nice meal on the area, Lov is really one of your better bets. 

A solid 3 star to me."}
{"text":"Lundi j'avais un d√©jeuner avec des coll√®gues, amies pour d√©couvrir ce petit bijou v√©g√©tarien. Le restaurant situ√© sur la rue de La Montagne est juste magnifique. Les arrangements floraux, la d√©coration...que de po√©sie, j'ai pass√© un moment sublime en tr√®s bonne compagnie et j'ai ador√© le Burger Lov. Tellement simple et d√©licieux. Tr√®s curieuse, j'ai gliss√© une cuill√®re dans la soupe qui √©tait d√©licieuse. Sucr√©e-sal√©e, j'en redemanderais encore. J'ai aussi craqu√© pour la tartine d'avocat.

{"text":"Came here after seeing those kimchi fries on the buzzfeed worth it videos. Didn't know what else to take at first, but the nice waiter made us recommandations and we decided to try the truffle and caviar zucchini noodles with the avocado toast and a matcha lattee. 

We were disappointed with the kimchi fries. The kimchi was too sour and the combination with the fries was just odd. There was too much sauce on top and the bottom fries were drenched in the kimchi juice and became soggy and sour. 

However, the other dishes were very impressive. The zucchini fries was delicious and refreshing. Even though it was with truffle sauce, it didn't feel heavy after eating the whole thing. The avocado toast was also very good and light. The matcha latte we tried it with almond milk and coconut milk and they both had distinctive flavors and were perfect. 

As for the place itself, the place is beautiful with their marble tables and the greens. They also have a beautiful terrasse outside."}
{"text":"Vegan burger that tasted like a big mac. Amazing!!! If you want to try something different then order their jackfruit quinoa fritters so delicious. Atmosphere and ambiance very nice as well."}
{"text":"I actually really like this location of LOV than the original site, there outdoor portion of the resto is absolutely beautiful. The bright whites and greens still remain central to the decor. The menu has expanded with a lot more options for our vegan and non-vegan friends. I am a non- veg, and I love eating here. I had a glass of red along with the bahn mi tofu burger- didn't really taste like anything like the viet-dish but I still enjoyed it. The burger came with a huge side of fries-that are easily good for two people. I loved having the tea here, it was really more for wanting to spend a tad bit longer to take in the lovely view.  Good for big groups, walk-ins with no reservations are fine for groups of 3-4 or less."}
{"text":"Contemporary decor: white and green. With a choice of sitting in Tarrasse. Service is quite friendly albeit sometimes can be a tad slow. Food is presented with neat and colourful display and tastes just like it looks: neat(no fat or dairy's heaviness), and very flavourful. And the price is lovely too."}
{"text":"Pretty good spot. The portions are tiny, like a tiny piece of avocado toast is one \"order\" of that dish, etc. Also, the brownies, which supposedly are fantastic, were mediocre. But overall, a good spot in a nice locale."}
{"text":"I would like to comment that they offer great fresh vegan food and cook with passion and 'lov' as the name carries the reason.  The choices and food flavors offer so much sensation and visual stimulation with a touch of simplicity. 

It was quite easy to make our reservation online with Open table.  The experience, in overall, was pleasantly smooth and relaxing.  It is unbelievable how busy they were on a weekday night, a Thursday evening. 

The service was exquisite and well organized in term of food order and table delivery.  The alcohol and mocktail we ordered were perfect and unique as they are serving, uncommonly seen in where we came from.  Thus, the experience is one of a kind to us as a traveller.   We look forward to return or one day, Lov would be a worldwide brand across the north America and the world.

P.S. glad to try their special combo Lov burger or banh mi burger with fries also including a wine or beer or kombucha fut. Great sweet deal $19 . We so much love this affordable dining experience in a special way and relaxing vibe"}
{"text":"Beautiful inside, great service, and all of the food we ordered was amazing. Best food we had in Montreal hands down."}
{"text":"This is an excellent restaurant and I encourage anyone visiting Montreal to check it out! I had the vegan poutine with sweet potato fires which were delicious along with the beet tar tar, which was spectacular. Audrey was working the bar and as a tourist, she gave me some good tips on what to do in town. Go here for wonderful service, excellent food, and a chill ambiance."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere with tons of seating inside and out. I loved sitting by the fountain. Definitely a must go to restaurant for a first day or anniversary. The service was one of the best I received in Montreal. I ordered the soup of the day. It was sweet potato soup. I liked the addition of the dried sweet potato. I also got the best root salad which was also very good and beautifully plated. The kombucha was also wonderful."}
{"text":"In the heart of downtown, a charming vegan restaurant was our choice for brunch. My family and I were mesmerized by the classy decor from all the walls to ceiling lamps to funny washroom stall decorated as plant pot. 

We were seated at the back; where we got the chance to enjoy swinging chair. It was a lot of fun.

We were served by Sean who was an absolute delight. 

I had an avocado toast with egg poached and my mom had the vege burger. Each dish was very tasty. With our dishes we had fun mimosas.

I continued to admire this pretty restaurant, and along with it the service and the food. 

Absolutely recommended!"}
{"text":"I really really really wanted to like this place.  It ticked so many of my boxes of things I like in a restaurant.  Beautiful fresh decor, healthy fresh menu with lots of interesting choices, great location... 

We came here the night of a show at the bell centre for an early dinner, giving ourselves 2 hours for dinner before the show, which we thought would be plenty of time.  We had a very friendly greeting and were seated promptly.  Drinks and starters arrived quickly.  I had an ok cocktail, it was pleasant but not outstanding.   Had the quinoa balls as a starter which were delicious.  

Things went downhill from there.  I had ordered the mushroom and onions as my main dish.  My friend ordered a pasta dish.  We waited half an hour... no food.  Asked our server, got a nice smile and a promise the food would be ready any minute.  20 more minutes go by.  Finally our meals arrive.  Mine is stone cold room temperature.  It's a small portion, overpriced for what it is.  If it was served warm, it probably would have been quite good, as the veg were nice and fresh.  But the sauce was cold and congealed at the bottom of the plate.  My friend's meal was apparently warm and delicious.  

We skipped coffee and dessert as we were already late for our concert as a result. 

I realize any place can have an off night, and I may give LOV another try, but it was definitely not LOV at first sight for me."}
{"text":"3.5
Honestly just alright and pretty over-hyped. It took a bit for the food to come. We ordered the gnocchi, power bowl and kimchi fries. The fries and gnocchi were very good. The power bowl does not deserve the name. It was a salad. And the dressing was weird with a strange texture. The ambience is really nice. Really well designed and decorated. They have a beautiful space."}
{"text":"Nous y sommes all√©s un dimanche et avions r√©serv√©. La r√©servation a √©t√© honor√©e, l'accueil a √©t√© chaleureux, le serveur tr√®s agr√©able. Le d√©cor est tr√®s sympa, tout blanc √©pur√©, avec du vert et des plantes par ci par l√†. Il y a aussi des fauteuils balan√ßants au fond de la salle.
Le menu est original mais il n'y a que 4 ou 5 plats sal√©s int√©ressants (assez copieux pour faire un plat) et 3 sucr√©s (cr√™pes, gauffre ou yogurt).
Le service a √©t√© treeees long (il y avait une table de 25 pers. en meme temps que nous et un chef malade nous a t on dit..) et nous avons trouv√© que les portions n'√©taient pas tr√®s copieuses.. C'√©tait tr√®s bon sinon, mais pas extraordinaire non plus..
Les smoothies m'ont aussi paru un peu chers (7 ou 8$ chaque)"}
{"text":"Really nice and comfortable atmosphere, extremely friendly service and delicious food! I had the hummus toast which was different but good, and then went with the gnocchi because I heard it was popular. Many dishes that looked fantastic and I would LOV to come back and try them."}
{"text":"I'm a vegetarian and on a visit to Montreal decided to stop here for lunch. I ordered the big lov burger. I read a review of it calling it a \"tour de force.\" This was not my experience. The burger was average, neither great nor bad. The sauce was the best part. The bun was stale-tasting and was totally breaking apart the way stale baked goods tend to do. I paid extra for the cheese but could hardly tell it was there. I've had so many much tastier veggie burgers  elsewhere. The outdoor sitting area was nice. I doubt I'd return. Maybe if a reliable source told me there was another dish I should try."}
{"text":"Only absolutely Lovely things to say about LOV! This place has the feels... you know the feels, when you need a bohemian, tropical vibe on a freezing Montreal day, yeah, those feels! The inside is super tropical, yet minimalist and clean. I'm talking clean lines, white on green on pale green. It is a floral masterpiece. There is ample seating, you would never guess from the way it is tucked into a quiet part of bustling downtown Montreal that it would be so SPACIOUS! This is a great place for groups. The food was delicious as well! I'm always in the mood for a delicious vegetarian meal, and this menu has been curated well. I met my buddy from Austin for a light dinner on a Tuesday evening. I started with a Mango/ turmeric lasso- which I'll admit was my least favorite part- WAY too much turmeric and not enough mango flavor. We had the quinoa fritters to start which were absolutely delicious! I need to learn how to make these. I had the LOV Burger with onion rings and loved every bit of it. My partner and buddy ordered two very good dishes, one was a zucchini squash dish that I don't see on the menu and I can't remember the other one. The food is what knocks this rating down a star. While my burger had no faults, the other two dishes didn't wow anybody. Still willing to go back here with some of my vegan/ veggie friends who visit Montreal."}
{"text":"Nothing crazy. Menu sounds much more delicious than the actual food when it gets served. The 15$ beet salad was nothing I couldn't have made at home. The 18$ Hero dish my friend had, despite its extremely generous portion of tempeh was truly ordinary in terms of taste. 
The kale Mac n cheese looked way better in the picture than in life. The kale was saggy and wet when I had imagined it savoury and crisp. Don't get me wrong, I ate everything on my plate anyway but the flavours were not nearly developed enough for the price tag. The decor is lovely and staff very pleasant but for that price I unfortunately will not go back. 
I had two cheap glasses of red wine a started and a main for 60$ before tax and tip, my friend with same meals but pricier white wine paid 80$ before tax and tip."}
{"text":"Today we had lunch at Lov (Rue De La Montagne). We started our meal with the beet hummus toast and the Japanese Eggplant. Both dishes were delicious and were served very quickly. However, for some strange reason our main entrees took over 25 minutes to arrive. While we waited I enjoyed a glass of their sangria and my boyfriend had a glass of French Malbec. After inquiring several times, finally our main courses arrived. I had the Big LOV Burger and my boyfriend had the Club sandwich. Both were great and for our extraordinarily long wait, we were comped two desserts. 

I'll admit, we grew quite upset after watching over 10-12 people being served their main entrees before we received ours and we arrived well before they did, however, our server was so nice, and even the manager explained to us that there was a mix up and they apologized profusely.  We then decided to continue with our meal. I had the vegan cheesecake and he had the brownies. One word, Amazing. It was worth the wait and the staff was quite apologetic."}
{"text":"My husband and I are just starting down the path to becoming vegan, so we thought we'd try Lov for something a little different and WOW are we ever glad we did!

From the moment we walked in the door we felt at home; from the crisp white decor, complete with an assortment of the cutest little bird houses, to the efficient and welcoming hostess who found us a cozy intimate table despite our lack of a reservation.  

Once we settled into the comfy chairs, it was a feast for the senses:  Just the right music for a Saturday night - upbeat but relaxing and not too loud.  Slightly dimmed lights.  Pretty little fresh sprigs of wildflowers in tiny vases on each table.  Mouthwatering aromas wafting in from the kitchen.  We ordered drinks and perused the simple but complete menu.  I ordered a glass of wine and I thought it was a nice touch that the waitress actually brought the bottle to our table to fill my glass.  

As our appetizers arrived (hummus for hubby and Mac & Cheese for me) it was an absolute eyegasm!  Seriously, the food looked too beautiful to eat... but we dove in and devoured every last morsel.  Neither dish disappointed.  How they managed to make such creamy Mac & \"cheese\" without cheese will have me Googling vegan recipes for days.  And I have no idea what they put in the hummus plate to make it pink, but I could have eaten two more plates of whatever it was.

After that our main courses arrived. I ordered the club with fries & garlic aioli.  I am a VERY picky eater, so I took my first bite with trepidation, not sure of what sorcery the kitchen had concocted for the vegan \"bacon\" or \"chicken\".  My husband watched carefully, leery of me making \"the face\" that would signal the end of our dining experience. We were both amazed when my taste buds burst with joy as the flavors and textures combined in perfect harmony.  I devoured half the sandwich then reluctantly relinquished the other half in return for the other half of my husband's gnocchi (we had agreed to share).  The gnocchi had the most amazing pesto and with a slight squeeze of lemon to add a little zest, it was delightful.  

Portion sizes were on point and the food was not too heavy, so we decided to try the two desserts on offer:  the chocolate brownie and the cheesecake.  While the brownie was a bit heavy and nutty for my taste, the cheesecake was light, fluffy and truly the best way to end the meal. I would go back JUST for another slice of that heavenly ambrosia.  

My only disappointment was that the service was a little slow (it took about 30 minutes for our appetizers), but that could be attributed to it being the first week in operation.  The overall experience was amazing and we will definitively be back to sample some of the other delights on the all-vegan menu - like the burgers that we kept seeing go by.

If all vegan food was this good, the world would have far fewer carnivores!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and great atmosphere! We loved the grilled cheese and mi lassi smoothie. The service was good and our waitress was so sweet. Definitely a fun place for brunch with healthy options."}
{"text":"As I am trying to be less of a carnivore, I am finding myself trying out a bunch of vegan places mainly to spy on what they eat and how so I can pretend to someday imitate them at home.
We tried LOV on a sunny Fall lunch time and were seated outside which was nice (thanks to the outside heaters though!).
The lunch menu was appealing. We got a couple of sandwiches and salads. It was good, original and pretty to the eyes but I have to say... for the price, I was a bit disappointed. Nearly 50$ and we were still hungry.
I know it's a lunch menu but some people (i.e., me) like to do things backwards and eat a big warm plate of food at noon and lighter for supper so it would be nice to have more filling items for lunch too. 
I will go back for supper though as we eyed the evening menu and it looked much better!"}
{"text":"I must admit that when I went to LOV I was not expecting to like anything on the menu. But I was proven wrong. I had the Lov Benedict with a mango smoothie and I really enjoyed it! Apart from the good food, this restaurant is so beautiful. Everytime I took a look around the restaurant I noticed a new detail that I had missed earlier. Service was good too as the waitress took her time explaining the menu and making suggestions. I'm curious about their other dishes so I will be returning."}
{"text":"Super beautiful decor. Everything we ordered was great. The poutine was topped with tasty gravy and cheese curds. The black bean burger came with a nice sauce and the patty was nice. The Indian casserole was unique and flavorful. Summer salad was topped with fresh fruits and the Mexican salad was well dressed and delicious. We were in Montreal for a week and ate here twice. Once during lunch hours and another time between lunch and dinner (limited menu)."}
{"text":"Phenomenal service, food, and drinks. We went for dinner and brunch and they didn't disappoint."}
{"text":"From what I have seen so far, vegan places typically don't focus on having a great decor. I guess people go there mostly for the vegan food. I have found myself wondering many times - with so many classy, chic restaurants in Montreal how come we don't have a classy, chic vegan restaurant - where people could enjoy both the food and the ambience. Restaurant LOV does just that - it has a nice selection of food and wine, great decor and gives the feeling that you are eating at a proper restaurant and not a food court.

To be honest I haven't tried any of their main dishes - so can't really comment on the general quality of the food. But will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Food is not bad either. The kimchi fries were exceptionally good. Interesting flavor combination. I had a Cumin cocktail which was nice, although I didn't taste any cumin in it."}
{"text":"Pretty restaurant and not annoyingly loud!

Serving sizes look small but are quite filling. I really liked the potato gnocchi that my friends ordered.

The poutine, lov burger, cheesecake and creme brulee were good. The chili and buffalo brussels were okay. The only thing our group ordered that was meh was the dip platter."}
{"text":"I came on a weekend for brunch, as one of my Montreal friends raved about this restaurant to me. I was immediately blown away by the attention to detail put into the decorations inside the restaurant! I was able to get a spot in the high ceiling section, which offered lots of natural light. There are swings in the back which you can relax in, and lots of tables. 

I tried: 

- The waffle: this was made with a vegan yogurt sauce, with chia gel and fresh fruits! It was quite a good portion size, and came with sufficient yogurt sauce (that was minimally sweet, but rather tart), and lots of fresh fruits. The chia gel definitely helped to fill me up! This wasn't too sweet overall, and felt very healthy. 

- The lumberjack: made with breakfast potatoes, lentils, fennel, dill, vegan smoked onion sausage, and caper aioli - this was a really good choice for a savoury dish; I was pleasantly surprised at how real the texture of the sausage was (given that I'm not a vegetarian), and it had a good smoky flavour. What really made this dish stand out was the copious amounts of savory sauce that had caper aioli; I kept wanting to dunk the potatoes into it! I even ended up dunking some of the waffle pieces into the sauce. Really satisfying!

- Coffee - cappuccino:  this came quickly and was strong. Perfect way to give a burst of energy for the afternoon! 

Service was attentive but maybe a bit slow at the end. I relaxed by hanging out in the hanging chairs at the back of the store before heading out for more shopping! The restrooms are also unique and very clean/cozy. Although I was full, I could have been more full...but it was an interesting experience!"}
{"text":"I lov this place! The food is just spectacular. I've been several times and never disappointed. 
Love the kimchi fries, the risotto and the cheesecake!"}
{"text":"Located in the middle of Montreal downtown, this place offers vegetarian options for both dinner and lunch. I went there during dinner time, around 8:30pm, on a Friday evening. Going in the restaurant, we were seated fairly quickly. 

The decor itself is very nice and welcoming. The service was also outstanding, and quick. The menu offered multiple choices of appetizers and also main dishes, and all are vegan/vegetarian choices. For the appetizer, we went for their vegan poutine, which to be honest was not great unfortunately. Or it may be as well the weird taste and consistency that threw me off, but definitely not a favorite at first bite. For the main course, I went for their risotto, which was good, but after a few bites. The mushroom that came with it complemented well the plate. 

Overall, a nice place with great decor, excellent service, and good vegan/vegetarian food."}
{"text":"I stumbled across this restaurant on yelp when looking for a nice dinner spot.  The reviews and photos made it look wonderful so I was eager to try this, as I am a solo diner this trip. 

I was not disappointed.  The atmosphere is lovely. Beautifully decorated, nice music, and not too loud.  I was promptly sat at the bar (mind you I came at 5:30 with no reservation).  Enjoyed a glass of white wine.

The kimchi fries are delicious. Great balance of kimchi, wasabi mayo, wakame, and fries.  The real star was the gnocchi di casa.  Perfectly al dente sweet potato gnocchi with a flavorful pesto on a bed of arugula.  Squeeze the charred lemon over the gnocchi for a nice acid addition.

All in all, I'm in LOV and will be back next time I visit Montr√©al."}
{"text":"I would strongly recommend a reservation for this place.It has a truly unique atmosphere and if you are visiting Montr√©al it should be on your list.The service was impeccable (James) and the management (Scott) was very attentive.I love their decorations.The food was beautifully presented .A great place for a date or if you want to try something different."}
{"text":"We had the pleasure of visiting this gem last night. Fantastic all around. The food was great, ambiance warm, and interior design captivating.

I enjoyed he Burger LOV and my wife had the mac & cheese. Both of us were happy with our choices. The poutine was also amazing.

Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"This place has an amazing vibe! I love how everything is local, organic, and vegetarian. Friendly staff, and great food. I tried the grill cheese and my sister had the gnocchi. We also started off with the kale Mac n cheese- I highly recommend trying. Very creamy, and dairy free! :)"}
{"text":"Food is always fantastic but I feel I have to mention your manager Christine, who goes out of her way to ensure that everyone's experience is amazing. Wonderful place, great food an staff."}
{"text":"We sat in the outside terrace at LOV restaurant on a Wednesday night. We had reservations which are definitely recommended as the restaurant was very busy. We had the mojito which was excellent and a glass of sangria with white wine, which did not seem like a drink for dinner. For a starter we had kimchi fries. Although the combination may seem strange, it works perfectly. We followed it up with gnocchi di casa and hero 2.0. Both of which were fantastic. I cannot recommend restaurant LOV enough. The service was exemplary and the waitress was very accommodating of our horrible French. Next time I make it to Montreal I will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Vegan food that looks and taste like high cuisine. The place is gorgeous, the service is good and the drinks are interesting. However, I did not like the ceviche so much and our friend found the burger a bit dry."}
{"text":"The decor is stunning and the waiters really pay attention to details. It gives me \"butcher's daughter's vibe\"'but with much more space. The menu is not too big but not small eighter JUST PERFECT. Cant wait to come back"}
{"text":"This restaurant is fancier than it looks in the pictures.  Marble tables, two levels of seating.  Several of their items are famous like the LOV vegeburger and the Macaroni and vegan cheese with spicy kale leaves.  I usually don't recommend deserts in a vegan restaurant but their cashew cheesecake was superb, try it and you may not want the dairy version again.  I'd come back to try more of their extensive menu."}
{"text":"I had an exceptional time at Restaurant LOV!  I found out about the restaurant in a BuzzFeed video and chose to go to try the kimchi fries they'd featured. I ordered the quinoa fritters, kimchi fries, vegetable lasagna, and BBQ jackfruit sandwich and shared everything!  For drinks we had kombucha and lemonade. The lemonade was absolutely disgusting in my opinion- it tasted like cleaning chemicals (so artificial). I was surprised our waitress said nothing when she cleared the table and saw that it was missing only 2 sips. Other than that, our waitress was great and very nice! I can't have dairy, so she put a paper carrot on the table to indicate an allergy. All of the food was delicious and I love that it wasn't vegan food trying to be something else!"}
{"text":"My first time at this LOV location! It's even bigger and prettier than the one on McGill. I ordered the benedict again since I enjoyed it last time and I did this time as well. There was a bit too much sauce this time though, but otherwise it was good."}
{"text":"I loved everything about my dinner there. I had the mushroom risotto and since I'm not vegan I chose to spend the extra $2 for parmesan cheese. It was incredible, portion wasn't huge but it certainly filled me up! Food came out fast and hot and the service was good, my water glass was always filled. I wish I was hungrier because I wanted to try everything on the menu. The decor in there was to die for, I'd live there if possible. I highly recommend coming here, I can't wait to go back next time I'm in Montreal!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been in Montreal for a few days and no place has impressed as much as LOV. The food and drinks are amazing. It's hard to believe that it is entirely vegetarian...you don't feel like you are missing out on anything. The star of the show however is Leslie. She is an incredible bartender and made great recommendations. We cannot say enough about her. Bravo Leslie! You made our experience remarkable."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the atmosphere of the restaurant... everything was so darling and perfect. Menu is great for anyone who has a dietary restriction."}
{"text":"First place me and my sister went to as soon as we arrive in Montr√©al. We were promptly seated with the given option of either sitting outside on the patio or inside the restaurant, we didn't really care much to where we sat so the host sat us outside. We ordered a Big Lov Burger w/House Fries and a Banh Mi Burger w/Kimchi Fries. 

Big Lov Burger: Burger patty was made from shredded young jackfruit but somehow you couldn't taste the jackfruit at all, it legit looked like a meat burger taste and texture wise, it was delicious but super messy to eat lol

Banh Mi Burger: Crispy tofu patty topped off with shredded beet coleslaw and spicy pickled carrots (holy crap so spicy lol). Pretty standard fare. Not much to say about it.

House Fries: For me...very salty, was drowned in salt but the white sauce used for dipping was so yummy, it was creamy and tasted like mayo but it was for sure not real mayo.

Kimchi Fries: Beautiful done, loved the addition of same. The Kimchi they have is made in house which is freaking awesome, I love how sour it is, it was perfect. Favourite for sure. 

This place is a definite go try if it's your first vegan food experience, there was a couple sitting across from us that were so stunned by how delicious the food was and the waitress was quite helpful explaining what their items were made from. Big recommend from me."}
{"text":"Having enjoyed my experience at their first location in Old Montreal, we decided to check out this second location in downtown Montreal. The venue itself is obviously Instagram worthy but also more spacious and comfortable than the first location. The menu being the same, I can attest that this is by far my favourite vegan fare in town! Great variety of vegetable and soy based dishes. The fried quinoa balls were stupendous. The Lov burger is my go to with its delicious toppings and moist veggie patty. The mac and cheese is always popular but i found it a little dry. Best part of the evening was definitely the dessert; their cheesecake is the bomb! Vegan or not, it's silky smooth and and delicious. For those like me that love wine, their list is quite impressive and includes a variety of whites, reds and even orange wine at fair prices. Definitely will visit again."}
{"text":"I took a risk and invited my entire family for a birthday dinner at a vegan restaurant. My grandma arrived and said: \"I've never eaten vegan before, someone order for me!\" Thing is, she's recently lactose intolerant, and so are my Mom and sister, and my boyfriend is vegetarian, and I'm not eating meat for the last months either since every time I do it bums me out. Hard. 

My family is kind of steak and potatoes by default. They have a New Years resolution to eat vegetarian but they, like most of us, struggle to figure out how to get out of their patterns and do it. So Lov was a risk, but one I thought could pay off big, and it did, and I was so freaking delighted. It was a birthday miracle. 

Service made the night so I'll start there. When you take your entire weird glorious family to a chic hipster restaurant sometimes it goes well, and sometimes the waiters are dicks and make your poor Mom feel uncomfortable for taking like an hour to order. (Just kidding! Love you! Take your time!) At Lov we were in such good hands we didn't feel like we were downtown on de la Montagne at all (let's be real, there are some douchebag vibes in that area sometimes.) Instead, we were somewhere cozy and warm with just friends and family where it was fun and ok to laugh and try new things. Our waiter snuck my grandma a little extra splash of wine, and made my sister laugh, and so I love him forever. And when my man and I got there early and starving, we ordered from a guy with his hands full of dirty plates and he brought us beers and fries while we held a 6 person table and never felt rushed or annoying (even though we probably were.)

And the food. This is vegan comfort food, delicate flavours but also hearty and cosy dishes. Collectively we had the kimchi fries (super yum) the coconut ceviche, which was inspiring and tasty and great. I wanna do all kinds of things to coconuts now. The wild urban mushrooms dish, which was crazy delish but could have come with a grain of some sort to soak up the delicious sauce and be a proper main. The vegan mac and cheese, which almost made my sister cry since she loves mac and cheese so much and can't eat cheese any more. We had the gnocchi at our table too which was tasty, those who ordered it seemed happy. And we shared all the desserts, the cheesecake was the winner but all were nice. In general my thought on the food would be to order a bunch of the small plates next time, the mains didn't stand up all the way to the creativity and flavours of the smaller plates for me.

The room and patio are huge and beautiful as others have mentioned. The food was tasty and cosy and you feel happy and healthy after and the prices are totally reasonable and fair. But as I know well from reading one zillion Yelp reviews in my job, what makes all the difference in the world when you bring people you love somewhere for a special occasion is the service, and these guys nailed it and I'm super thankful. All the stars! Birthday miracle!"}
{"text":"What a beautiful Sunday brunch spent at LOV.  Food was simply delicious and the food presentation was beautifully done as well. Our waiter Vincent was super friendly and prepared a candle on our dessert for a surprise birthday celebration...it was cute and thoughtful.  Absolutely love the decor of this place too, it's got the fancy chic South Beach vibe to it. Was surprised there were not a lot of people there, which was great for us...Felt like VIP guests. Love LOV!"}
{"text":"Restaurant LOV is the perfect haven for vegetarian foodies. The name is actually an acronym meaning Local, Organic and Vegetarian and not Love of Vegetarian, but this could be also said of this beautifully decorated and hip restaurant that appeared on the Montreal food scene late in December 2016.Started and owned by Dominic Bujold of Pizzeria 900 & Crudessence, it has the winning formula as most of his concepts in terms of d√©cor, food and popularity.

  There are at least a dozen good vegan restaurants in Montreal, but none do it prettier than LOV.
Set on rue McGill in Old Montreal the restaurant is impressive when walking past it in the evening. 
Lit up with tons of lighting and painted in hues of white and light green, it exudes a crisp clean feel of simplicity, with hints of nature here and there. 

Yet Restaurant LOV is not only for the healthy conscious, it has a happening bar scene with long communal bar tables and seating and a great wine and cocktail list. The menu created by Stephanie Audet formerly of Crudessence is innovative, original and absolutely delicious. There is lots of interesting choices to be had even for the non-vegans. 

I have to admit this foodie is somewhat of a carnivore. I like a good portion of meat with all my meals and do not feel satisfied just on a bowl of veggies. But there are times at lunch and breakfast in which I prefer salads or just fruit. Vegetables are less heavy and somewhat cleansing and have much more beneficial health properties than meat these days which are filled with hormones and antibiotics.

I began eating more vegetarian meals after eating at Crudessence and seeing that vegetables do not need to be bland.  They can be used like any cut of meat; some creativity is required but today there are many combinations for meat replacements. Lately, I started visiting the Copper Branch Fast food outlets and sampled tempeh for the first time. I was pleasantly surprised at how good it tasted and started to think of ways where I can incorporate this, many more items in my menu. Monday evenings have now become Vegetarian night. We take a break from eating meat and we cook stir fry vegetables, casseroles or stuffed veggies. I am starting to experiment with different ideas and eating at LOV and Crudessence has been inspirational.

The evening I visited LOV, I was running late and was rushing to get there on time.  I little stressed and nervous I managed to find a parking lot a few doors away but had to pay $ 15.00. for parking, I knew it was going to be an expensive evening.  As I rushed down the street and rushed up the stairs I could not help being awed by the lighting, the brightness and the decor. My friends were already there waiting and had scored the table next to the window in the alcove. The perfect spot to people watch. 

As I settled in, I looked around and really liked the feel of the place. I started to feel less stressed as I perused the menu. The restaurant was already buzzing with a youthful vibrant crowd seated at the bar tables. My girlfriends had already gotten their wine and it took about 35 minutes for the waitress to come back around to take our order.  I ordered 4 oz of Vale del Maule 2015-Naranjo a natural orange wine for $ 15.00. A full glass of 8 oz will put you back $ 24.00, our waitress Justine was nice enough to advise me before I placed my final order. This made up for the slow service we received. The wine was delicious and perfect with my starter of endive and citrus salad. 
 
For starters we ordered the stuffed portabella mushroom, quinoa fritters, endive salad and LOV Poutine.
The endive salad & Citrus salad at $ 14.00 was refreshing and a perfect mix of bitter and sweet. Topped with walnuts and Goji berries, it was a good start. 

The Quinoa Fritters - $ 10.00 were just as delicious. We received 4 quinoa fritter balls made with jackfruit, Konjac and Corn topped with a turmeric aioli and pineapple salsa. Different in texture and flavor, the fritters were innovative and original. The fritters came packed with tons of health benefits. I had never heard of Jackfruit, with some research I discovered it is a tropical fruit that resembles Durian. It has lots of health benefits and it is sweet in consistency but must be cooked. Konjac is a flour which does not contain starch or sugar and is used more as a thickening agent, perfect for those with gluten intolerances. 

The Stuffed Portabella mushroom-$ 12.00 was stuffed with a walnut and prune Duxelle, it came with a drizzle of apple vinaigrette and topped with organic vegan cheese. The presentation left much to be desired but the texture and flavors were wonderful and tasty.

The last appetizer was the Poutine LOV-$10.00, their signature dish made with sweet potatoes and miso gravy. Topped with kale chips and organic vegan cheese curds. I liked this dish, although my friend found the Miso gravy too salty. Everyone loved the mix of salty and sweet potatoes and the crispy kale gave it some text"}
{"text":"Wow! What a nice restaurant! It's very trendy, the service is amazing, the food is delicious and the presentation is WOW. Highly recommended! My favorite is the chef salad!"}
{"text":"My friend and I are both vegetarians who had heard a lot about this place before our trip and were super excited to go! We went for dinner and were seated at the bar (because all of the other tables were reserved). The menu featured a wide selection of food that all looked really good, and the aesthetics of the restaurant were absolutely gorgeous! 

The main issue here was the service. Our waitress was not friendly at ALL - when I asked for the flavour of the soup of the day, I received the reply of \"I don't know\". There was no attempt on her end to ask any of the other staff which I did not appreciate. The rest of the service we received from her for the rest of the night was also not great as she would often take our plates away without asking if we were done first. However, the rest of the wait staff all seemed lovely so perhaps she was just having a bad day. 

Apart from the service, the rest of the experience was mediocre - the food was good but not worth the high price. I might try the other location for brunch (and hopefully better service!) but would not come again for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Excellent vegetarian food most dishes are vegan. This restaurant does offer the option to sub in dairy cheese if requested. The staff is attentive and friendly, the wine list is well curated, and the atmosphere is elegant without being stuffy. We enjoyed our experience here so much that we went twice in the few days we were in town. Outdoor seating is lovely and holds a crowd. Have the ceviche and the poutin."}
{"text":"I'm from Toronto. Prior to visiting Montr√©al, I did my research, and made a list of some vegan restaurants I'd like to visit during my stay. LOV was one of them, and I was excited to try the food they offer. My boyfriend and I got to the restaurant shortly after they opened, so there were only 2 tables seated before us. We placed our order and proceeded to admire the decor - which was beautiful. 

During our wait, we saw more and more customers coming in and were being seated. Every table that were seated after us, got their food before us. Even the tables next to us were surprised that they got their food first, since they ordered much later. 

We arrived at LOV around 11:45am. Got our appetizer at around 12:10pm, and didn't get our mains until 12:56pm. We waited an hour for our food. I understand delays and usually don't fret over them, however, there were such a huge time gap between our appetizer and our mains! It was also upsetting to see groups (large and small) that came after us, finished or was finishing their food, while we were still waiting on ours. We got so frustrated at one point, we asked the server why our food wasn't here yet, but she assured me it would be there shortly... nope.

We ordered the Buffalo Brussels Sprouts as an appetizer, the LOX Bagel, my boyfriend ordered a Big LOV Burger and LOV poutine. The Brussels sprouts were delicious, but wasn't tossed properly. The sprouts at the bottom of the dish were drenched in thick buffalo sauce, while the ones on top were light and crispy. I found a piece of hair on my LOX Bagel, but because I was so hungry at the time, I didn't care. I just ripped off the piece of bagel with hair on it. The poutine was good, however, the portions were quite small. 

Overall, if I were ever in Montr√©al again, I think I'll look for another vegan place for brunch."}
{"text":"The LOV burger is delicious and by the way, it's vegan! If they didn't tell you, you wouldn't know! Best vegan burger I've ever had, hands down! The burger tasted homemade and I'm a burger connoisseur! The poutine is decent and the mac n cheese is okay. If I had more time in Montreal
I would go back to try the onion rings. The cocktails are tasty and the ambience was great. The service was a little slow, but it could just be the American in me!"}
{"text":"Very nice decor and great for Instagram photos! Though neither food nor service is even close to the decors in the restaurant. We went to Lov for lunch, and ordered a kale Mac and cheese, avocado toast with egg, one of the burgers, the curry with pancakes and their gnocchi. First of all, our waiter looked like he is having the worst time ever doing his job. We asked him what he would recommend and he said a salad. We asked him if he could offer anything else since we didn't wanna come to a vegan restaurant for a salad and he just stared at us and said the salad is good and said I'll give u more time and left. Now the food. The avocado toast was okay, nothing special but to get an extra egg it was 2 dollars?!? And the portion was really small so it was kind of disappointing. The kale Mac and cheese was so dry but it tasted alright. The best dish was the Indian curry but the pancakes were also dry and again was nothing special. The burger came with nothing else other than a maybe a pickle, it tasted as depressing as it looked, had no flavour at all. The gnocchi was horrible, it was dry and just tasteless. We planned on getting desserts at first but after our meal we just decided not to. Sure come for the photos but not for the food."}
{"text":"My first visit since I'm from out of town. I had avocado toast with a poached egg and chai latte. Yum. So good I ordered gluten free mac n cheese to go. Service at the bar was attentive. And they feature smoothies, wine & cocktails. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Was in Montreal for the holidays and had to see what this place was all about. We ordered a few plates to share, it's been a while so I can't tell you we had but i do remember that we enjoyed our appetizers way more than we did our mains. The appies were so flavourful but the mains were lacking seasoning. It's a nice restaurant. I think super cute for a first date."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on a weekday. I was absolutely in love with the decor and ambience! The hanging swing chairs are adorable, the bathroom has a sink that is resting on a bicycle, there are adult coloring books available. Now to the food -- I had the burger which was one of the best veggie burgers I've ever had. My fianc√© had the kale mac and cheese which was also good. We shared the onion rings which I liked because they stayed crispy but my fianc√© found them to be flavorless without much seasoning. Would come back during a future trip to Montreal!"}
{"text":"Les rondelles d'oignon ont √©t√© servi froide, ils ont ouvert les fen√™tres alors qu'il faisait tr√®s froid... service un peu lent. Le d√©cor et l'ambiance sont agr√©ables."}
{"text":"I'm completely blown away by this restaurant. Initially, when suggested this place I was a little hesitant to try it out. They have another location on McGill College that I didn't have a great experience. However, the LOV on de la Montagne is a completely different experience.

First of all, let me just rave about the decor and ambiance. When you're walking in, they have a beautiful outdoor patio/terrace. During this winter season, they have it decorated with lovely Christmas lights and trees. It gets even better when you walk inside though. Their decor remains in the same theme as the other location, with a predominantly white/green color scheme. Such a gorgeously designed restaurant and they spared no detail when decorating.

The only thing better than the decor was the food itself. My friend and I ordered the basil/arugula pesto gnocchi, stuffed portobello mushrooms, and the kimchi fries. I'd highly recommend the kimchi fries, it's excellent and perfectly seasoned! Their food is delightful and fresh. You can tell immediately that they're using high-quality fresh ingredients. Was thoroughly impressed with all the dishes and can't wait to come back and try out more. It's quite rare to find a vegan/vegetarian upscale dining experience that isn't completely overpriced. LOV manages to hit the ball out of the park and you will enjoy every single aspect of your dining experience.

This restaurant experience is equivalent to receiving a beautifully wrapped gift only to find out it gets better and better as you start to unwrap it. Don't waste time debating a restaurant choice and get yourself to LOV asap."}
{"text":"This is a very eclectic vegan/vegetarian restaurant in old Montreal. Reservations are recommended but we went early and were able to get a table before the busy time. The food choices are varied and range from burgers and fries to lasagna, risotto and gnocchi. The food was good and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place.  Great food, great atmosphere.  First time trying out Poutine, vegetarian style."}
{"text":"Servings might leave you still hungry, but otherwise great!"}
{"text":"GORGEOUS! I had already fallen in love with the one on McGill, but this one blew me away. The decor is so refreshing and pretty. The staff hospitality was A+. One of the employees offered to show me the mezzanine and informed me that they will open the third floor in the near future. Place is noticeably much larger than McGill. Service was on point. Went for brunch and asked to be seated inside so I could have the chance to get a good look at the place. Had a mimosa and the fruit bowl with vegan yogurt. Never cease to impress me with their food. Mind you, I'm not a vegan, but this would be my favorite vegan spot."}
{"text":"Absolutely magical restaurant. We ate here twice on our trip to Montreal. The service both times was super efficient and attentive without being overbearing. The waiters were incredibly kind (and, gratefully, bilingual). The decor of the restaurant is funky and very instaworthy. And then there is the food...the menu here is creative and yet comforting. Full of things I miss from over a decade ago (the pre-vegan era) like Caesar salads full of flavor, a crackable crem br√ªl√©e and loaded fries. I love that they have a seasonal menu. The Hero 2.0 was by far my favorite dish. Future trips to Montreal will always include a visit to Lov."}
{"text":"When LOV was opening, I expected alot. And they delivered. Though at first the brunch didn't impress me, I thought the portion was kinda ridiculous, the dinner however did. 
I went to both locations and for a group, you are better off at De La Montagne because it's bigger. They are both as nice so it's really just about the size of your group. 
The service is always excellent with friendly and helful staff
We ordered quite a few things to share: Mac n Cheese, Grilled cheese, quinoa fritters, Curry, Salad, Noodles and the Mushroom delight (You can get gluten-free version of a lot of things) Everything was delicious. The \"ceviche\" though doesn't taste anything like a ceviche should, was delicious (they probably should rename it to avoid disappointment...)
Go and see for yourself, it's worth it :)"}
{"text":"I rarely ever write negative reviews (as you can see on my profile), but unfortunately I did not have a good experience at this LOV location. I've been to the old Montreal location and had a fabulous time - and I was hoping de la montagne would be the same...unfortunately this was not the case. 

I made reservations for a Saturday evening, and was really excited to go. I wanted to move my reservation to an earlier time, so I called the restaurant and requested if this was possible and they happily agreed. 

On the website they state tables are held for 15 minutes, and I arrived within that time frame. I was asked whether I wanted indoor or outdoor patio seating, and given the extreme heat wave with temperatures reaching almost mid 40s (in Celsius), I requested indoor seating. The ma√Ætre d' happily chuckled and agreed it would be a good idea. I didn't anticipate any issues as I saw ample seating available inside (it was 6, and that's relatively early for dinner in Montreal) - plus I had a reservation. Then out of nowhere, a bald, bearded man wearing glasses denied the request to sit indoors and said he only had a table available outside - I was not made aware when I made the reservation that I would have to be seated outside. Given the circumstances of the extremely warm weather - I denied that option. He made no effort to rectify the situation and offer another timing to seat me and my party indoors. Thus we left the restaurant rather frustrated and disappointed. 

Having tried LOV before, I was really hoping it would be a special meal for me and my party, but unfortunately this was not the case. I wrote a letter to them through their online review form and will update this review once I receive a reply. Moral of the story for now; don't expect to be seated indoors when there's an extreme weather alert."}
{"text":"Difficile de ne pas tomber en amour (encore) avec le nouveau restaurant LOV. Cette fois-ci, LOV apporte un vent de fra√Æcheur au centre-ville de Montr√©al! Situ√©e sur une rue pourtant majoritairement occup√©e par des restaurants qui servent de la viande, c'est beau √† voir. Le moins que l'on puisse dire, c'est que LOV n'a d√©finitivement pas perdu de son attrait original. Bien au contraire, en fait!

D√®s que vous arriverez au 1232, rue de la Montagne et que vos yeux se poseront sur la magnifique terrasse (avec fontaine, guirlandes lumineuses et beaucoup de plantes!), vous saurez que vous √™tes au bon endroit. Si vous avez d√©j√† √©t√© au premier LOV dans le Vieux-Montr√©al, vous serez surpris par l'√©tendue qu'occupe le nouveau restaurant. On parle d'environ 200 places au total et il y a m√™me un 2√®me √©tage disponible pour les √©v√©nements sp√©ciaux.
Comme on peut s'y attendre de LOV, le cadre est magnifique: plafonds hauts et grandes fen√™tres, fleurs, d√©coration en bois, etc. M√™me les toilettes ont √©t√© enti√®rement r√©nov√©es pour refl√©ter l'identit√© visuelle unique de LOV. L'√©tablissement est r√©put√© pour avoir le titre du restaurant le plus \"Instagram-worthy\" de la ville. Un coup d'¬úil aux quelques photos d√©j√† disponibles saura vous convaincre que c'est amplement m√©rit√©! Le seul b√©mol est que, puisque le restaurant est beaucoup plus grand que le premier sur McGill, on perd un peu en intimit√©. Rien de majeur, cela dit: LOV parvient √† projeter une image raffin√©e et soign√©e tout en demeurant accessible et accueillant pour tous.

Lorsque j'ai ouvert le menu, j'ai √©t√© agr√©ablement surpris de voir que tous les plats (sauf une salade, curieusement!) √©taient indiqu√©s par d√©faut comme √©tant v√©g√©taliens. C'est la deuxi√®me fois que je fr√©quente un restaurant v√©g√©tarien o√π les produits d'origine animale, comme le fromage et les ¬úufs, sont propos√©s en option. M√™me si je regrette encore que LOV ne soit pas 100% v√©gane, j'appr√©cie beaucoup les efforts mis en place. Le personnel m'a √©galement confirm√© que m√™me les vins avaient √©t√© soigneusement choisis pour leur absence d'exploitation animale (autant dans les ingr√©dients que dans le processus). Les portions ne sont pas √©normes (plus petites que les autres restaurants v√©ganes et v√©g√©tariens √† Montr√©al) mais la nourriture est d√©licieuse et les items du menu sont assez vari√©s. Il y en a pour tous les go√ªts, de la salade jusqu'au burger en passant par des plats plus exotiques (comme la Casserole des Indes avec cari d'aubergine). Si vous venez √† plusieurs, profitez-en pour commander plusieurs plats et les partager!
J'ai aim√© la fra√Æcheur des ingr√©dients et l'originalit√© des aliments propos√©s (feta d'amande, chutney d'abricot, croquettes de quinoa avec c¬úurs de palmier, etc.). Beaucoup de soin est apport√© √† la pr√©sentation des plats et c'est, √† mon avis, un des principaux points qui distinguent LOV des autres √©tablissements. On ressent un r√©el amour pour la cuisine.
Aussi, le personnel est aux petits oignons. Sympathique et souriant, un(e) serveur(se) viendra toujours remplir votre verre d'eau!

Le premier LOV √©tait unique en son genre et, en toute honn√™tet√©, je ne pensais pas qu'il √©tait possible de faire mieux. Je suis heureux d'avoir eu tort! Du charmant d√©cor jusqu'√† la qualit√© des plats propos√©s, l'exp√©rience LOV vaut le d√©tour et prouve que cuisine gastronomique, sant√© et √©thique animale forment un ensemble d√©licieux.

{"text":"I have to say my experience at LOV was better than the time I went to the McGill location. The decor is similar to the McGill location. I love it! It so zen and romantic...especially now with the Christmas lights outside the building. 

I arrived at 6:50pm and there was a 5 a 7 sp√©cial which meant $5 cocktails! So worth it! I ordered two right away. I ordered one cocktail with gin and berries and another with Canadian Club and cucumber. The first was fruity and sweet. The second was light and refreshing. Both were good but you couldn't really taste the alcohol. I think a lot of ladies would like it. I feel like both would make for very nice summer drinks. I later ordered the miso cocktail with sake and pineapple miso but I didn't like that one at all. I switched to Blanche beer after that. 

So I only ordered the gnocchi. It was good but the plate was small. I should have ordered an entree as well. That's my bad. I thought eating pasta would be filling enough. There was half a lemon that I squeezed all over the pasta. The gnocchi was with pesto, Parmesan, basil and arugula. The size of each gnocchi was big for gnocchi but I just wish there had been more gnocchi on my plate. My friend gave me a kombucha battered onion ring and it was the best onion ring I ever had! They were humongous and so crunchy! With the aioli it was even more delicious! You don't taste the kombucha. I also tried a bite of my friend's vegetarian burger. It was just ok. Nothing special. I would not order it. The fries were solid though!! 

Considering we were a group of approx 15 people I have to say the service was good! The waitress kept asking if everything was ok which I really appreciated. When I went to the McGill location I remember the service was terrible and I was only with two other people! 

On a side note, I have to add that there were some inconsistencies with the menu. They had a special  with the burger or banh mi which came with either beer, wine OR kombucha as stated on the French menu but on the English menu it said beer, wine AND kombucha so it was a bit misleading. For sure it was meant to be OR because otherwise it would have been too good to be true but still my friend got excited at the thought of getting wine beer and kombucha when he read the English menu lol 

I am not vegetarian so this is not the type of resto I would pick for myself but if I had to go to a resto with a vegetarian friend I would def come back to this resto. So for me this place is def A-OK!"}
{"text":"Starters are very good and but less variety in main course. Ambiance and interior decor is extremely good."}
{"text":"I really like the vibe and concept of this restaurant. I dined here twice and found some of the items delicious and some of them just ok. The kale mac and cheese was ok, the noodles were a little bit too overcooked, but it came out quickly when I was looking for a fast lunch.

I got the onions as a starter for dinner because I saw someone else had ordered them. I think I was in love with the first one I had, but they were so heavy and greasy that it turned out to be a bad idea and I definitely wouldn't eat more than 1 again. I got the gnocchi for my main as gnocchi is one of my favourite pastas. The gnocchi were good but the sauce was a little bit lacklustre. I guess I prefer tomato sauce compared to vegan pestos.

I would return to try some more of the menu and hope I would pick better choices next time."}
{"text":"En plus d'√™tre une tr√®s belle place instagramable (des balan√ßoires dans le restaurant !) sur des tons verts, blancs et bois, les plats propos√©s sont excellents et sant√©.

Le restaurant Lov poss√®de une belle capacit√© d'accueil, ce qui rend l'endroit un peu bruyant aux heures de pointes mais une fois les assiettes pos√©es devant nous on pardonne tout ! Les champignons portobello farcis sont divins, ainsi que les gnocchis au chanvre. Le menu donne envie de tout essayer ! J'ai d'autant plus appr√©ci√© la carte des cocktails sans alcools originaux et succulents. 

Une superbe place qui vaut le d√©tour.. profitez de pouvoir r√©server en ligne !"}
{"text":"Meilleur restaurant vegan √† Montr√©al et les alentours! Je suis r√©cemment vegane, j'ai essay√© quelques restaurants et c'est d√©finitivement mon top 1!  Qualit√© et fra√Æcheur et m√™me mes amis carnivores adore!"}
{"text":"I got really sick eating there this week. I'm willing to bet they use MSG in their food. 
It's a shame because the staff and decor is really nice but I'm never going back there."}
{"text":"Loved the deco! The food was ok and the prices were very reasonable. I would def go back :)"}
{"text":"Never had the chance to try this place!
Went here a Monday 4pm after making sure it is supposed to be open but it wasn't for some unknown reasons. When I called to ask they said it was an exception ;)"}
{"text":"We were excited to try this restaurant after reading the reviews. My sister is gluten free and was very happy to see that the menu specifically marked the gluten free items. We ordered the salad and gnocchi off of the express menu as well as the lox bagel and vegan poutine. The lox bagel came with a side salad. We ordered mimosas to go with our meal and iced coffee. All were very tasty especially the mimosas. The food was just as great as we hoped it'd be. My only complaints are that the wait for my main course, the gnocchi, was a bit long. We also finished our water and I didn't have anything to drink during half my meal. Our waiter was very nice but busy so I understood. Overall a very good meal a bit pricey but I would definitely recommend trying. The decor and atmosphere was amazing.  Very busy around lunchtime. We sat inside but the outside sitting area was beautifully set up also."}
{"text":"This was my third time and each time I've been the food has been exceptional. Our waiter knew about wines and was able to recommend a good wine. Service was quick considering we were six people."}
{"text":"Best place I went to in Montreal - especially as my boyfriend and I don't react well to dairy, though none of us are vegan, and it was some of the best food I had. Can't wait to come back next time I'm in the city"}
{"text":"After having had a mediocre experience for brunch at the old port location, I decided to try supper at the new downtown location with friends and I must say I loved the meal! The outdoor seating terrace is perfect for the summer and the indoor seating is also very nice. 

Between the three of us, we shared a beet salad,  gnocchi,  an indian casserole and a poutine and thought it was just the right amount. Aside from a rather hard chickpea pancake, the rest of the meal was perfect. Personally, I thought that the plates are decently priced and just big enough, but people with bigger appetites may find that one dish per person might not be enough. I would happily return for another meal anytime"}
{"text":"We went for a lunch to this location a few weeks ago. This is a vegetarian restaurant but there are vegan options as well. Decor was very nice, it's worthy of Instagram. It feels much bigger than it actually is. They also have a nice terrace out front.

Food wise, I was a little disappointed. I had the pesto pasta dish. It was extremely salty. Portions are very small. Mac & Cheese is about the size of standard scientific calculator. One of my pet peeves is there glasses; they are so small!

I will give them another try for a dinner though."}
{"text":"Excellent place to try, decoration is super nice, staff ultra friendly, fast service. Now the food is tasty you can see the Entr√©es in photos. We ordered two Burgers I had the Lov Burger  and i loved it so much that i forgot to take a photo of it. Daaamn!!!
And yes don't forget to order side orders cause nothing comes with the burger. Bon apetit"}
{"text":"This place was amazing!!! I'm always so excited to see vegan places that step it up a bit and offer a fancier location for more sophisticated outings. It reminded me a little of the restaurant Planta in Toronto. The decor inside was very nice and botanical. We asked to sit outside, but the patio was closed since there was a chance of rain so we were seated near the window instead. We ordered the gnocchi, the mac and cheese, and the quinoa fritters. I loved the gnocchi and pesto -- it was a fresh spin on a dish that usually isn't plant-based. The quinoa fritters were also tasty, and it's always fun to see restaurants get creative with how they use ingredients. In my opinion, the kale mac and cheese was fairly standard. Tasty, but it doesn't live up to the comfort food feeling I want out of a mac and cheese (even if it is vegan). We thought it was pretty funny that the waiter offered my mom and I separate bills, but overall the service was also great and efficient. Would definitely go back here on future trips to Montreal!!"}
{"text":"Tout est pens√© ici. La vaisselle est de bon go√ªt,  la pr√©sentation des plats ne serait ce qu'une tartine est vraiment top. Les aliments sont frais et d√©licieux. Assiettes g√©n√©reuses et servies dans un temps raisonnable."}
{"text":"Dinner=Love.... 
The starters were good and the portions big so I didn't dare to eat everything at once... leaving some room for the main courses..... If the starters were good the mains were amazing the urban mushrooms and the gnocchi.... wow (the portion size were fine but I could have had more of it... pure gluttony). Even if me and my date were full at this time we went for the desert and again not disappointed.... good cheese cake and the bleuet estragon ice cream very delicate. 
Great to find a vegetarian/ vegan place with gluten free options not just serving burgers and salad.
I wish I could bring this restaurant home...."}
