{"text":"Phenomenal picture of a Philly Cheese Steak with loads of meat.  The reality is mostly bun.  Bland flavour. Definitely pass by this place."}
{"text":"Pretty good, made to order.  Not a bad price and they will customize your order for you.  I get the cheesesteak with buffalo sauce and salt and pepper.  Stick with plain fries, gourmet fries are too much. The line up moves fast and you get your food fast."}
{"text":"The guy that runs this Charley's does a great job. He listens to your desires then has a team that executes freshly made to order sandwiches. Has good specials too. If you want a real thrill, ask for a glass of water and hear him him yell into the microphone \"Lake Erie Highball\" One of a very small number of things worth eating in downtown Cleveland.

{"text":"Not sure why all the hate on this place, if you've been to philly for a cheese steak this place can't be compared to them mainly bc you're not in Philadelphia and surrounded by hype traveling to eat a chees steak, BUT I'd say better buns then most places I've tried in philly, soft rolls that still hold the meat and toppings without breaking apart. Yes it isn't stuffed to the brim with meat, but really for a $6 combo what are you expecting?? Not sure how many people have the understanding of cost of goods especially when it comes to food as we've been conditioned by the fast food machine.  In terms of being bland, I never had a bland experience and have been going there since it opened, it's better than food that sits out all day and shovelled into a take out container, at least the grill the meat and veg to order on the spot so you know you're getting fresh cooked food instead of processed prepackaged food.  I'll be coming by soon Charlie!"}
{"text":"A decent option, but not something I'd go out of my way for again.  I was on my way back home after an event and decided to make a stop at the Square One food court, suited to boot. Faced with few options and knowing that the mall would be closing soon, I opted for Charley's Steakery, one of the options that moved in when the food court rebranded itself as \"high-end\".  As others have mentioned, the mystique is more impressive than what you actually get. For just under $14 dollars, I picked up the Ultimate Club (regular) combo, which came with a drink and fries. The portion size was smaller than I expected, although I was starving and wolfed it down without a second thought. I probably should have just gone for the original cheesesteak, but I erroneously assumed that ordering an \"ultimate club\" sandwich would have a bit more to it than a small pile of meat.  One point I will give them is that the fries are delicious and are served piping hot. Likewise, it is a decent sandwich - just not $14 delicious.  This is the second time I've been disappointed overall by Square One's food court, after Big Smoke Burger. Charley's Steakery is decent, but overpriced and not worth the visit unless you're really into cheesesteaks or don't have other options."}
{"text":"I close my eyes and travel back in time where I envision my younger self, hands pressed against the cold glass of the living room window, the flickering of the Christmas tree reflecting in the foggy pane.  It is Christmas morning and I look out upon the smooth white blanket of snow, undisturbed and sparkling in the cold air.  It's sound-deadening properties quiet our suburban soundtrack of dogs, birds and the occasional car, and in this moment, before anyone wakes up and the chaos of present-opening begins, I am truly happy. This is the memory a part of me secretly hopes to relive during my visit to Toronto after living in Glasgow for the last 6 months, but unfortunately the forecast calls for 14 degrees and sunny, so that fantasy seems unlikely.  I had compiled a list of eateries to visit during our three weeks here, a veritable who's who of fast food delight that may sound abhorrent to some but as a once-a-year pilgrimage seemed like a great idea prior to actually going through with it. As of today I've eaten through them all, and am sad to report that 95% of them were an utter disappointment, another set of misinformed memories of flavor (or the lack thereof).  That being said, there was one place that stood out so much that I had to go back and eat there 2 more subsequent times during my trip.  That place is Charley's Steakery.  This little gem of a place is located in the Square One Shopping Mall food court - a food court that's now been redesigned, gentrified and rebranded into a shadow of its former self, now blanketed with the same marketing-friendly font found throughout many upgraded malls around the city.  Gone are the days of Styrofoam containers and waxed soda-cups, they've been replaced with real plates and cutlery at every establishment - the 'up-market chic' branding an attempt to hide the fact that for the most part you're still eating the same bottom-of-the-barrel grub as before. As such, Charley's Steakery may seem like a pretty innocuous stall nestled between two chain-eateries, one proclaiming to be an 'experience' in 'Teriyaki' and the other a barely-edible global-chain sandwich shop, but I've always considered it so much more than just that.  Their showcase dish is a Philly Cheese Steak, a meal that's brilliant in it's simplicity - flank steak fried up with onions, green peppers & mushrooms on the freshest bun I've ever had anywhere.  But that's not what I was specifically here for this fine mild day in the middle of December - cause dat gravy was calling me from all the way over in Glasgow.  At a hearty 80% Canadian opacity, this was a gravy that screamed 'hey, let me help drown out the irritating din of the last-minute Christmas shoppers with my deliciousness', and brother let me tell you, it followed through on that promise.  As I plunged the solidly built French fry into the jus, my first bite was a delightful dancing of thyme and a mystifying sweetness rarely found in a sauce from a food court.  It was a 60/40 mixture of beef and chicken respectively, and that majority flavor of beef resulted in a surprising sweetness that burst forth not unlike Jack Nicholson bursting through a wooden door.  But instead of his famous line, this sauce instead screamed \"HERRRRRE'S GRAVY!\"  You don't get gravy like this in Scotland. My time here in Canada has almost come to an end, and when I inevitably return for a visit this is the only place I'll be returning to eat at.  Memories are a difficult thing to quantify; blurred by time, distorted by perception, and while some still hold true - like the warmth and welcoming nature of our families and friends, others never quite measure up to the images imprinted in our minds eye. I'm not sure I'll ever get to experience that childhood memory again looking out on the snow covered lawn, at least not here in Toronto, but as long as Charley's Steakery keeps operating on that same grill, with the same staff, in the same location it's been in for 20 years, I know that coming home again will be worth it.

{"text":"As far back as I can remember, I always make a stop at Charley's Steakery in Square One for their 3 Cheese Bacon and Steak sandwich. It's the only one I've been getting all this time and don't see myself ever changing that. At times when I'm starving, I get a side of fries. Which is made hot & fresh every time.  What stopped me from giving this review 5 stars is them starting to be stingy with portion size. Sometimes I ask for mushrooms & onions with my sandwich and I'm only given a pinch full of those items. They don't charge for it, which is probably the reason why I'm given so little. Also, whenever I feel like it, I ask for extra cheese. Which is a $1 more. Which is fine, but the menu states it's a 3 cheese sandwich. Sometimes they forget to add it and I have to remind them. Or they just add one slice of cheese. Guess I should ask next time how much extra cheese they add for the $1 cost. Lastly, they're inconsistent with their bread to meat/cheese/lettuce/tomato ratio. Sometimes there's not enough for the price I'm paying and sometimes it's perfect. All I ask is for a little consistency. Other than that, I wouldn't go anywhere else for a steak sandwich."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there for our first time today. What a mistake. First of all, the ladies bathroom had no soap or paper towels to wash/dry your hands. My husband had the steak sandwich and I had the chicken ranch. There was so little meat on the sandwiches that we were perplexed when we were finished.  The inside trash was overflowing. I have been sick to my stomach the last hour....never again."}
{"text":"dont even waste your time here. Go somewhere else. There are a dozen other options in the food court at Square one and I am sure they all taste better than this place. No flavor or seasoning, it actually tastes like the beef is boiled or steamed or something, its not for me, thats for sure  I think one visit was enough.  If for some reason i ever crave bland, i will think about this place but in my 45 years of life that has not happened yet"}
{"text":"I usually go to the one at fiesta mall but this one was by the theater so I decided to try it...big mistake, they changed the prices but didnt change the menu price...but the main reason I only gave them 1 start is because when I got home and started to eat it...a 1/4 of the sub was so soggy I had to cut it off :( what a waste!!"}
{"text":"It's a fair place but I wouldn't go out of my way. The portions are kinda small for the price & the food is mediocre. Not that you can expect too much from a chain, strip-mall style place. It'll do in a pinch but I'f recommend to try Corleones or Uncle Sams instead."}
{"text":"OK, now this is a steak sub place that is actually worth mentioning.  *Much* better than Great Steak & Fry.  They also have good daily specials, so you can save some money.  For a chain, this is pretty good food.  I eat here almost once per week for lunch.  I must say, however, that I've eaten at other Charlie's stores, and they aren't as good as this one.  The owner/manager must take special care at this location."}
{"text":"I was so happy to see a Charleys pop up in Arizona! For some reason we're like the only state that doesn't utilize this amazing quick restaurant.   The thing about Charleys is that it's always been kind of expensive but the fries alone are worth it!  This location seems to be a classic case of lost in translation. Their fries aren't nearly as good as any other Charleys that I've ever been to and their sandwiches can't even compare. The service is really fast compared to other locations because it's pretty much a ghosttown.  Someday I'll get a great Charleys experience without leaving the comfort of my home. Someday :{"}
{"text":"Hard for me to review a cheesesteak place in Toronto as I used to live in South Philly !! So my GF was craving a cheesesteak so we gave it a shot ...she got the fixings as they do here in Toronto meaning peppers lettuce all that crap . But I wanted it as authentic as possible which would be whiz wit !! I know your all like what the hell is that ? Well a real cheesesteak is with cheese whiz and onions so they sort of made it for me as they had there geese sauce for the fries and added fried onions ...it wasn't bad it was actually alright . I mean it needed to be more greasy but was ok for me not having to drive 10 hours back to Philadelphia. Anyways it was nice of them to try and make it as authentic as possible the server was nice and price was ok . give them a try ."}
{"text":"Amazing as always. The classic philly cheessteak will never let you down. Fast service, great food!"}
{"text":"Most flavourless Philly Steak Sandwich I have ever had. Not even worth the $6 combo price. Fries where pretty meh too..."}
{"text":"I'm from Pennsylvania and I know this place isn't authentic, but it's pretty good. It's a bit dirty, but the staff is very good and the food is decent."}
{"text":"I was totally impressed by the owner (Rigo)'s enthusiasm and service. He makes the sandwiches taste better just by the way he makes you laugh! I have since referred at least a dozen of my friends to eat there, and I recommend you give it a try too!"}
{"text":"I remembered I tried this place a long time ago and told myself never to eat here again.  Three years later, my memory got the best of me and I took the bait - again.    And like last time, this place was an utter disappointment for \"Philly cheese steak\".  Go on their website and you'll be dazzled with images of mouth watering beef abundant sandwiches.  The reality is far less satisfying which would be fine I suppose if they were not charging $13 a sandwich.  There is a lot more veggies than steak in sandwich and you are left wondering, \"why did I spend my $15 here?\"  Don't do it.  There are far better options for food here."}
{"text":"There's not much to say about a place that you've probably already been to if you've ever been to a mall food court or airport, but there are two specific things to point out about this location, in the Hyatt Regency Arcade:  1. Cash only 2. Nicest staff EVER!! The guy who runs the counter is probably one of the friendliest people I've ever met downtown - always has a smile and true enthusiasm when interacting with customers. All of the people making the sandwiches are friendly too.   I probably only go here about once a year, but still get a friendly hello and wave from the dude even when just passing through."}
{"text":"I'm sure it's not as good as in Philly, but I thought it was pretty tasty!  I got a large with mushrooms and peppers, onions, etc and did a combo with gourmet fries.  God the gourmet fries are great!  I took about half the large home (the gourmet fries are filling!), which was great.  I took off the lettuce, and heated it up a few days later.  Excellent.  I do agree that the meat needs more seasoning.  Guys, please use seasoning salt, it's cheap and good!  (Like the now, sadly, defunct, Great Canadian Steak and Potato Company)."}
{"text":"I was hoping for finally a good Philly but didn't find it here. They have the meat correct with exception of its quality. The bread seemed old and tasted stale. Finally their fries were a disappointment. I recall going to a Charley's in a mall and they were awesome! Unfortunately, that wasn't the case here :-("}
{"text":"One of the best steak's I've had in a long time! The service was great and the recommended the cut of steak to get and it was delicious!!"}
