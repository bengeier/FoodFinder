{"text":"Some of the best Indian food I've ever tried.
Unfortunately, the decor was less than amazing.
It's dark, the place isn't sufficiently warmed in the winter, and its dirty.
If you can ignore all that, the food is absolutely worth the inconvenience.
The best part was that my asshole wasn't destroyed afterwards.
Would recommend."}
{"text":"Pathetic food and ambience. Waited 20 mins for the order. Rotis were half burnt, chicken was super spicy and totally inedible. Kulcha was tasteless and spicy. Reminded me of the food I used to get in my hostel in India. Can't believe I paid 50$ for it.
Avoid this place, there are much better indian restaurants in Brampton."}
{"text":"Food is average here and reasonable. Been here 3 times and each time they charged me $10 extra on my bill. Please check your bill before paying. washrooms are dirty and stinky. My first visit was good but the last 2 visits were disappointing.  Food quality is not consistent and not piping hot at times. Please spend your money wisely here. Make sure the waiter has your full attention while taking your order properly. since they tend to look away while taking your order."}
{"text":"Prepared differently than most Indian places we have visited which makes this place special.  Food was very good and portions were large.  Service was excellent. Well spiced and authentic food."}
{"text":"Good food nice dhaba type setup. Fish tandoori is good. Need focus on cleanliness. Don't have specified beer. Tandoori roti is nice. Butter chicken is ok"}
{"text":"Loved everything that we had! The tandoori salmon was delicious and had the perfect amount of spice. The kebabs were juicy and full of flavour. The daal makhani was honestly the best daal I have ever had other than my mother's. The tandoori roti was delicious but the plain butter naan had to be my favourite since it was so light and fluffy. Will definitely be coming here more often! The price was very reasonable for a family of three we only spent $50 including a tip! You should totally visit this spot."}
{"text":"Casual little place with authentic and very delicious food. It has become my favourite place to drink and eat. Affordable prices and amazing service. Its run by a very friendly family and they are very polite and hospitable. If you love good authentic Indian food and not too concerned about the ambience then give it a try."}
{"text":"Very bad experience. Let me start, I ordered over the phone because my friends and I were on our way to the restaurant (we where 10 minutes away). We get to the restaurant and we are asked to sit down so we proceed. To start, all of the cutlery and glass ware was dirty. We then waited 20 minutes for the waiter to come. Since we called in, we thought that naturally the food would have been ready, but it wasn't. Sadly the waiter (who has 0 knowledge of any sort of customer service) came and asked us what we like to order, we told him that we had called in earlier and that we had been waiting for 20 plus minutes with dirty utensils and glasses. He then told us that our order was ready and he took the glasses and got us new cutlery (only cutlery no glasses). We waited an additional 20 minutes and I had absolutely had it with this place. We didn't even have water for the past 50 plus minutes . The waiter brought our food and our glasses. We had to get our naan remade because it was soft and not crunchy. That really upset the waiter who argued with us before finally replacing the naan. We ate and finally paid for our orders and I had my word with the waiter. My experience at this location was very upsetting. I wouldn't recommend you go here."}
{"text":"Definitely appearances are deceiving. Really great veggie korma."}
{"text":"We came to this place on a Friday for a late dinner after finding a great deal for a four-person meal on Groupon. When we arrived, we were surprised to find it tucked away in a plaza; rather inconspicuously. 

Hardly anyone was in the restaurant, which was a shame because it was excellent. Local places like this one are few and far between. 

King Tandoori is an unassuming restaurant both on the inside and on the outside. It seems like the sort of place that you might never find, unless you heard about it from someone else. And although I do think the decor/ambience could probably be spiced up a bit more, the food itself (and the service) shines through and makes up for it. 

We ordered four subjis (Shahi Paneer; Dal Tarka; Aloo Gobi; Saag) alongside 3 servings of Laccha Parantha and Onion Parantha, each. Each dish was incredibly flavourful and just the perfect amount of spicy. In particular, we noted that the Shahi Paneer tasted different than other local places, but in the very best way. Nothing that we were served was overly oily, and we left feeling full, happy, and satisfied. While I enjoyed all the dishes, my favourites were the Saag and Shahi Paneer. Additionally, the alcoholic drinks menu is reasonably priced (as is the food for that matter) and I was served a full glass of wine (close to the very top of the cup). 

Overall King Tandoori is a place that we will definitely be coming back to - Groupon offer or not. The staff was incredibly friendly and welcoming; they added an unforgettable charm to the joint. I recommend checking it out, so that you can experience it too."}
{"text":"So I ordered a takeout for a tandoori chicken ( one of the best I have had outside India) and lamb sheek kabobs. Perfectly seasoned, well maintained , with no added food coloring and very flavorful yet not so spicy as to burn your tastebuds. 
It is a very unpretentious place with a very ordinary ambiance but the food is another level. It is my new goto place for my Friday night indulgence."}
{"text":"Real good Indian restaurant deep in Brampton.  Does not look the greatest from the outside/interior is old; but food speaks volumes.  Tandoori chicken is actually cooked in the tandoor and not in an oven and proclaimed to be made in tandoor like many Indian restaurants do.
Butter Chicken-  very good 4/5
Naan Bread- nice thin and crispy 4/5
Rashemi Kebab- Juicy and flavorful 5/5
Full Tandoori Chicken- Excellent, cooked to perfection, juicy 4/5"}
{"text":"I used to visit this place regularly. For the last few months both taste and service is going down every passing month. They just have 1 server and food is taking long time to cook. Ordered 1 chicken gravy with 2 naans. Chicken was cold and naans were uncooked. When i mentioned that to server. She said its perfectly fine and moreover refused to change iy. After its said i will pay she forget to order it to kitchen guy. My whole lunch idea was preety much done and i have to came back disappointed. Will nwver gona visit this place again."}
{"text":"It was my first experience at King Tandoori and it didn't live up to the reviews/hype. I ordered a half tandoori chicken and it tasted very bland (it lacked salt/Spice and flavour). A well marinated Indian style tandoori chicken is pretty spicy and flavourful. 
I would any day pick half chicken kebab at Bamiyan over this. Never going back for food.

They started Hakka style Chinese and Thai food too since yesterday. The prices for them seemed high to me from Brampton or Hakka standard. 10$ for a bowl of soup is pretty pricey IMO. 

The USP of this place is that you can buy drinks at pretty reasonable prices and eat snacks (chakhna) along with them, which is what appeals to most people based on what I heard and observed. You don't get that at Bamiyan."}
{"text":"By far the best indian restaurant in Brampton. If you want Dhaba style indian food, look no further. Its just awesome !!"}
{"text":"King Tandoori's food quality is excellent. The staff is amazing and very friendly. We always enjoy their food. Food is awesome and service is so quick. Would love to visit again and again.If you are really looking for a great taste in Indian food then come visit this place. Ajay is the best host!"}
{"text":"this place was horrible. the food was oily, the service sucked, the lights are dim in this place..the place was dirty. Trying to order our food was a task..they couldn't understand the word CURRY. My friend and I ordered same thing and I was charge more. The food ended up in the garbage. Think twice before going in this rate infested place."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday evening. 

Pros: 
- Fairly priced
- Food is average 

Cons:
- Ambiance"}
{"text":"This is one of those hole in walls with delicious food. Don't expect fancy anything. They have two dining areas. Enter left door if ur a truck driver or a group of uncle ji's. Enter right for family dining. I was in family since it was my cousin and I. They are quick
On taking your order and even bring u a decent plate of chutney and an Indian salad.  We order the lamb chops, sizzling and full of flavour. I had to start with the butter chicken. It was good but next time I'd get the chicken tikka masala only because I need my food spicy. And then we got some garlic naan which complimented the butter chicken perfectly. It was light crispy and soft.  They even have a tv with Bhangra beats.  Between two ppl it was $25. So it's cheap.  I wanted masala chai but they refused to make me some because they were too busy and there was no chai wala. I found this hilarious but that's how many ppl walk thru....both doors!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best tasting food I have had in Brampton. Their quail is awesome and so is the lamb chops. Goat curry was the best I have had at any restaurant. To finish it off, the Gulab jamun.. Simply delicious."}
{"text":"The food wasn't amazing like the previous reviewers said it was. I ordered the butter chicken and naan, The naan felt like rubber and wasn't as tasty as ones I've had previously. The butter chicken wasn't and didn't even look like butter chicken and tasted more like a curry dish. I can appreciate how nice it is that they open until 2am however, because getting hungry at midnight and only having the basic option of mcdonalds sucks. I may try it again and get something else next time before writing the place off completely but the food itself was not memorable"}
{"text":"Amazing food ! It was really good and fresh. Food takes some time to come  but its worth the time. Courteous staff and good prices."}
{"text":"One of the best places to find tandoori meats cooked in Brampton and area!
living here, I have tried many different places
the amount of variety they have here is just amazing
its more for takeout, but they have a dining section - very dark though
the place is hard to find if not from around here, its close to many auto shops in Brampton
but honestly, worth it!
priced a bit higher for the same product at other places, but taste is well worth it!
lots of fish options and small apps
try it for catering your next event, why not!:)"}
{"text":"We love their Rutherford road location and when I found out there was a new location close to home I jumped.

I was hoping this location was as good as the other and to my relief it was. We ordered naan and Reshmi Kabab which was juicy and bursting with flavours.  My wife and I agree this is our favorite Tandoori joint in the GTA.

A must visit."}
{"text":"Had a craving for kebabs and beer. After losing a golf game to a friend he suggested we try this place to feed his hunger and settle our bet that the loser (me) buys dinner!! 
We arrived to a fairly quite industrial area and were the only ones in the restaurant. Service was prompt but typical Indian style (no enthusiasm!). We ordered lamb seekh kebabs, makhani chicken, chicken tikka masala, and garlic naan with two cold beers. 
Two sizzling platters came out in no time with the kebabs and chicken and honestly, they were amazing! Next came the curry and naan, again both simply delicious and fresh. I could not get enough!!
The favorite however had to be the makhani chicken, so tender and flavorful that my mouth is watering just thinking about it!
Can't wait to come back and give their other dishes a try! No more need to drive all the way to Lahore Tikka House! 
One comment: Have the server be more customer engaged, a simple hello, how's it going will go a long way!
See you soon!"}
{"text":"We were in the neighborhood and found this place with decent reviews. We got the mint chicken tandoori and the butter chicken with two orders of naan. Both were really amazing, I especially loved the butter chicken, it was tender, buttery with the right amount of kick! I loved dipping the naan in the sauce.

Now onto the not so great parts... we were the only dine-in customers around lunch time (12:30), but our orders took forever. The mint chicken came first but the naan didnt come until much later (and we had to chase for it). We wanted to eat the meats with the naan... and the meat was getting cold. They did have a lot of take out orders... and later the waiter came to apologize, apparently the place was short staffed because some of the staff were stuck in traffic... they were also setting up the restuarant like putting down carpets, but they pretty much just slammed down the carpet which generated a lot of dust... we were eating right next to that... so I wasn't too impressed about that.

Services aside... the food was great. I think take-out would be great."}
{"text":"the food is extremely delicious and fresh - i am still shocked at how good it was - we just wanted a late night bite and this was the only place open jn Brampton - and i am hooked - we even got food to go because it was that good"}
{"text":"Amazing food. The ambience is not that great. But the food makes up for it. Amazing bitter chicken and lamb sizzler. A must go for indian food lovers."}
{"text":"Came here because of the reviews, the food is horrible. I got food poisoning, and today the entire day I was at the hospital with stimach pains and vomiting. Never coming back or recommending this place to anybody"}
{"text":"This place is close to the office and was recommended by a colleague. The problem is that they don't open until 12:30pm and timing was never right to come here, until today. I arrived at 1pm. The plaza this place is located in is pretty bad and the parking lot could use some serious TLC. Once you enter the restaurant area it's not that bad, although the dining area is quite cramped. The kitchen and takeout area is in the back.

I took a seat and was given a menu and a pitcher of water. There were metal cups on the table already. I went with the mint tikka chicken and an order of naan. Shortly after the waitress brought some condiments. One plate was sliced red onions, pickled carrots with cardamom and finely shredded daikon. The second plate had three 3 sauces, a red pepper sauce, yoghurt sauce, and a green chilli sauce. These were all great accompaniments to my meal.

The chicken was served on a hot plate wth a bed of onions and the portion was quite large. The pieces of chicken breast had a great green colour and you could tell the chicken had been marinated for some time. It was great, the chicken was moist and great with the sauces and condiments provided. The naan was served piping hot, so light and not oily.

I really enjoyed this meal and will definitely come back when I can."}
{"text":"I get a chance to visit this place and i must say they have pathetic service when it comes to serve food. Main course was served without Naan (bread) and left the food as it is because it got cold after 15 mins wait. Not a good experience!!"}
{"text":"Nostalgic Indian food at its best .
First visit n not disappointed at all !
Tried their lunch specials and Chana bhatura , both were outstanding n calls for a second visit .
Strong good smell in the restaurant, I wish they could get better exhaust .
But great food n service ."}
{"text":"Even though I can't stand Brampton, there is some decent food, it's just a horrible city otherwise (no arts, horrible downtown, boring).. This was a great find, good lunch specials! Family run, quite busy (for reason). Decent prices, can be slow. One critique, it's called tandoori, they had none available when I was there (better prep needed).  A great meal otherwise! Place has character, it ain't pretty!"}
{"text":"If you are a meat lover and love tandoori this place is really good. I was transported back home and it felt like I was eating at a dhaba. 
Enjoyed the lamb chops and the battair.
Please don't go in expecting a great ambience. It looks like an Indian Dhaba"}
{"text":"First Rate Tandoori at bargain basement prices!


I finally got a small taste of King Tandoori's Brampton (Kennedy Rd.) location. I have heard of it for quite a while yet its remote location and lack of occasion kept me from it.
A daughter of a dear friend, back in town for her convocation, explained its raison-d'être as 
A place Punjabis go after many libations.
The South Asian equivalent to our Western custom of post-bar eats of burgers, fries and assorted greasy dishes to soak up the booze. Which explains why it's open until 2 a.m. and most of the other tables were occupied by men. 

As June 2017 marks the 35th. anniversary of my first Indian meal I can't think of a much better way to remember that initial repast more than half a lifetime ago.

I got there mid-meal but am able to comment on the following;
Fish Tandoori ($9.98) - Made with Grouper on this visit and was the moistest, most perfectly cooked fish in an Indian resto I have ever tasted. Sadly most Indian establishments overcook fish which is a sin. The accompanying homemade sauces were fresh piquant and flavorful. 
Keema Naan (Listed as Chicken Naan on the bill - $3.99) was a quintessential and terrific example of the perfectly prepared Indian classic.
Their Masala Chai ($1.50) was strong, not bitter, sweet and oh so creamy.
Pistachio Kulfi ($2) which came in mini plastic cups wasn't particularly appealing at first glance but as it tempered, the authentic taste more than made up for the lack of visual appeal.
All for the very reasonable tab of $75 (which fed five diners) before tip.

Admittedly the place is nothing to look at, decor doesn't even enter into the conversation, in fact, their \"private dining room\" places patrons in the unenviable position of being exposed like live mannequins in a display window. However, don't let that deter you from dining there as it serves the intended purpose very well with terrific quality at bargain prices.
Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"They open till late every day.  And staying open till late wouldn't be possible if you don't serve good food. 
Yes the food is pretty good.  Authentic Pind da taste. Everything tasted fresh and pure. If you love dhaba food from back home,  come here. 
I tried Baingan Bhartha and liked it. Their sweet lassi was awesome too.
Guess will keep coming back here at late nights."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. 
It's called King Tandoori 2. They have another location not far from here. 
This place is open till 2 am 
We were about 30 of us and we crashed their restaurant at 10 minutes to 2 AM and they welcomed us with open arms. They patiently served all of us with delicious food and without cutting any corners or rushing. 

The staff was extra ordinary. They were smiling and very helpful. None of them were rushing to go home.  Food was equally good. All their Indian dishes were made to perfection even that late. 

Will keep going back there."}
{"text":"Th  food here is amazing !!! The butter chicken is the best in the gta. Tandoori quail is very tasty and the chicken wings are mind blowing. Chana masala is full of flavour . Definitely a repeat !!"}
{"text":"We order for 40 people catering. Chicken were bloody and burnt pieces, when we informed them then owners reply stunned me.  He said we make tandoori chicken but we dont what inside the chicken.  Daal were worst daal ever, paneer were with no taste at all.  Chilly chicken were  way too spicy not everyone can handle it.  Butter chicken, i can cook better than them.  All we like is goat curry but that was too much masaala in it so u cant eat more than 2-3 spoons.   Students are handling this location and owner is too sweet buttery person but once you place an order he will show u the real face.  Never recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst tandoori (Indian BBQ style) place I've tried in recen. 

Had the lamb kabob and chicken Reshmi (chicken with spices in a cream sauce (which was recommended by the staff). 

It was so over cooked I might as well have eaten rubber. No discernable taste / spices in either one. 

I would like to put more words here, but I'm at a loss. I will give them the 1 star they deserve. The food was on time, courteous staff and seems to be a clean restaurant."}
{"text":"Very good food.

Decor isn't the strong point - looks like a converted sports bar (Sports Bar - the definition of a location with no character whatsoever).

Service isn't overwhelming but it is friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"The great reviews for this restaurant were spot on. Don't let the store front or decor prevent you from eating here. The food was delicious and hot and the service excellent. 

We had Tandoori chicken, vegetable biryani, a couple of salads and naan. 

One of my pet peeves with Indian restaurants that claim to serve Tandoori chicken is that they pre cook the chicken and reheat it just before serving. This results in dry chicken. This was not the case here. It was cooked to order. Tandoori chicken takes 20 minutes but well worth the wait. If you want great Tandoori chicken eat here.  If you want reheated chicken go to any one of dozens of other Indian restaurants or Swiss Chalet

The vegetable biryani was delicious and the naan light and crisp"}
{"text":"I found this restaurant by accident.  I was going to go to a local Afghani restaurant and noticed this gem.

The menu had lots of great options.  Veg, and meat.

I need to eat gluten free.  There were lots of options.

I had the lamb curry and the Eggplant.  The lamb was nicely stewed and very soft.  The eggplant was also fantastic.  I find that a lot of restaurants struggle to make eggplant well.  They delivered well on this.

The spices were done very nicely, but if you don't like heat, let them know when you order.  I love heat, but the food was very hot in temperature and spice level.  The flavour was there though.

The place had lots of seats, and room, for people to seat.  The service was good and the food came out fast.

Great food."}
{"text":"Don't make the mistake of coming here if you can't handle spicy food like me. I'm a wuss when it comes to anything remotely spicy and had a pretty hard time here...

My friend and I drove out to Brampton for some good Indian food, as we had heard that there was a sizable Indian population here and we wanted to go for a drive. This was one of the few places still open when we got here a little before midnight on Saturday.

When you go in, there are two doors. Go to the left if you want the lounge, or to the right for the actual dining area. We went to the right. We ordered a couple things to share:

-half order of the tandoori chicken ($8.99) - this was good but a little too spicy for me. I could only eat a couple bites

-egg bhurji ($9.99) - this dish saved my butt during this meal. I've never had this dish before (it's essentially scrambled eggs, Indian style) but it was not spicy at all, thank god!

-chicken biryani ($9.99) - way too spicy for me. I ate one or two bites and my mouth exploded with spicyness. Also I wasn't a fan of the chicken...it was cut into overly large pieces and tasted pretty dry. My Indian friend didn't like this dish at all either"}
{"text":"Good food with casual atmosphere. We came here upon a recommendation by a friend and found it to be a nice little Punjabi restaurant. 

We came here on a Sunday evening with a group of 5 people and tried the following:

Mint Chicken Tikka  - Absolutely amazing! 

Lamb Seekh Kebab - amazing! usually Lamb Kebabs turn out very dry and unappetizing, but this one was the best we've ever had! Really moist and flavourful.  

Vegetarian Saag - Pretty Good

Vegetable Biryani - Great Indian style biryani loaded with lots of vegetables. 

Chicken Vindaloo - Boneless chicken in a spicy tomato & onion based curry. I especially loved this one.  - I would highly recommend trying this one

Chicken Tikka Masala - Nothing too amazing, I wasn't a huge fan of filler vegetables like green peppers and onions in a cream based curry. 

Lacha Paranthas - well made, definitely recommend

Plain Naans - Pretty good, I did like that there was seasoning worked into the actual dough which gave it a nice flavour. 

One thing I would recommend, is knowing what size subji you'd like, we ordered one chicken curry dish last minute to add to our meal, and they automatically assumed it would be the large size, we didn't realize until  the end of the meal we could've ordered a small. 

Seating is a bit tight, so it may be a little harder for larger groups."}
{"text":"This place is open 24/7 so if you're looking for late night eats this is definitely your place! It's super affordable which puts it above other Indian joints. Most places I find are pretty expensive just for the meat dish plus you have to buy Naan separately, here the meat dish and the Naan are bother quite cheap. I've tried numerous items on the menu and they've all been great. 

The food always comes out fresh and fairly quickly. Every time I come it's after 11PM and they're always pretty busy. The menu has a lot of options including lots of vegetarian options. I love the garlic naan from here!

All in all this is a great 24 hour restaurant, with good affordable food. I'm sure I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch, exterior and interior isn't very inviting. Very dark inside with not too bright lighting even though it was a bright and sunny day outside.  Had the lunch special chicken biryani.  I've had a lot of different types, this place is amazing in terms of the food quality and taste.  You have to try it out, quality food."}
{"text":"I am definitely in awe with King Tandoori's cuisine. Their specialty, the whole Tandoori chicken was just that; Worthy of a King. Sides included salad and yogurt.Service was courteous and prompt. Seating included both tables and booth."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing, but everyone is right about the place it is a hole in the wall, even a baby crying in the kitchen  (I thought it made it homey) . Watch out some of the dishes have small bones that can take you by surprise."}
{"text":"- FOOD: 5/5. OMG!!! The food tastes amazing. They offer medium and large portions for your convenience. My wife and I ordered 2 medium veggie dishes + rice + garlic naan and we were thoroughly full afterward. The food was genuinely tasty with a rich combination of flavours that you can expect at a more upscale Indian restaurant. Honestly, it's truly a gem IMHO, because from the outside and inside this place looks pretty sad, but the food is top notch.

- SERVICE: 5/5. The service was friendly and helpful. Aman, the guy who served us was courteous and prompt. No complaints whatsoever about the service at this restaurant.

- INTERIOR: 2/5. The interior feels like a remodeled cheap and tacky roadside sports bar. The hideous LED lights inside were giving me a headache. They were absolutely awful, even though they're probably saving the owners money on electricity bills every day. They could have at least opted for the daytime-type LEDs, not those blue-ish bright ones. The washrooms are gross. Old and dark. I hope the owners of this place invest some money in a proper reno. It badly needs a reno of the main dining hall and the washrooms. Perhaps, 80% of this restaurant's clientele are not so demanding like I am and perhaps it doesn't bother them as much as it bothers me. If I can provide some advice, I'd suggest taking design cues from the amazing interior of Bhai's Indian Canteen (8-115 York Blvd, Richmond Hill). The owner of that place really put his heart and soul into creating a modern and welcoming atmosphere at his restaurant and I applaud him for that.

Bottom line: If you don't mind the tacky interior, you won't be disappointed in the food.

THE BEST PART: This place is open until 2am 7 days a week. :)"}
{"text":"Brampton is also known as Bramistan given how heavily populated it is with Southeast Asians (i.e Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis etc.) and the strip malls here are filled, filled, filled with every imaginable Southeast Asian eatery.
The problem is where do you go and which ones are authentically good since many of them turn out to be so-so and just plain bad? Surprisingly given how many eateries there are here, not a whole lot of them have Yelp! reviews and the few that do, did not have high ratings.
My cousin and I were in the area since her son had a hockey game to play and both of us are curry fiends. We found King Tandoori after using my Yelp app and the reviews and high ratings are completely justified.
Yes, it's true to exterior and the decor inside are nothing to write home about, very sparse, very bare but also I should add, and very importantly, clean.
We ordered up lamb biryani, mango lassis, naan bread to take home, and I kid you not, we inhaled everything, even though portions here are quite generous, prices are cheap, service was very quick and friendly, it went that quickly because it was *that* good.
The lamb biryani was super flavorful and had a bit of kick to it in the aftertaste. The lamb was cooked perfectly, super-moist and practically melted in your mouth. The rice was also spiced up accordingly and very rich and filling, like biryanis should be. They have a real tandoor oven in the back and the naan bread which was coming out of it was fluffy, not chewy at all but disappeared almost the second you bit into it.
I sincerely hope other people find this place and help keep this family restaurant going because they seriously deserve it and even though I'm not in Toronto often, I hope the next time I go, it will still be there because I want to try so many of their other dishes."}
{"text":"This location is horrible the whole dinning area is covered in smoke and service is extremely slow. They serve mango shakes in beer glasses that are poorly washed and found stuff in the drink half way through honestly I'm shocked this place is even allowed to be open."}

Just no!
I told myself In the last review i wasn't coming back but I thought maybe just give it another chance.
Bad idea and waste of money ..

The place is extremely dirty! The kitchen was disgusting! 
The staff was sliding while walking on the floors because they haven't moped in weeks! 
The food was average nothing great.
Took a long time to get the food.
Just very dirty !!!
I would not recommend !!"}
{"text":"I'm from the Metro Detroit area which has really great diverse of Indian, Bengali, Punjabi restaurants. I'm staying  at the Element up the street so it's super close, so I make the quick walk with a friend from work. We both enjoy super spicy foods we ask the guy what he has. Doesn't name the dish but it was a good spicy red lamb style curry. There's a lady who made a previous comment about the place being, unfriendly, slow, dirty, and blah blah blah. It was just the opposite in my experience. The manager was cool asked us to taste the dish before we left which accommodated our taste bud experience. Both of us were in an out in less than 10min. Only complaint I would have is that we didn't get any rice. (Paid for 2 dinners, 4 pieces naan and a beer for $35). We get back to the room pop our lids and dive in the taste test had us cracked out, the curry was awesome and super spicy. He threw in some yogurt sauce to cool down the bite. This food so far is the best bite, looking forward to other dishes since I'll be here for the next 2 weeks."}
{"text":"I don't like kabobs much but the chicken kabobs at king tandoori are very, very good. Butter naan with the kabobs taste amazing together. I also had their palak paneer with dahi and I must say that I've never been so satisfied with every single dish at an Indian restaurant. The service was really tentative as well. I would definitely come back here again soon!"}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Punjabi food! Ordered the yellow daal, paneer tikka, fish pakora. Delicious! The ice cream is made in house - not too sweet, no artificial flavors.

We will be back!"}
{"text":"Hey Friends, hands down this hidden gem is the best Indian restaurant, forget about the outside or inside decor as it's real outdated... if you like authentic Indian food then don't waste time with other restaurants."}
{"text":"A guilty pleasure of mine. A nice little Punjabi restaurant in a plaza just off Highway 7. They always have cheesy Punjabi music videos playing on the TV which adds to the charm. I typically get the veggie thali lunch special, which for $7 is great value and is amazing. Tasty, filling and great variety. I would highly recommend if you're looking for quality North Indian cuisine."}
