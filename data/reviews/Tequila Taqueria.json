{"text":"BOMB food.. HORRIBLE service.. Thankfully you get your monies-worth. The food is a bit pricey (like most places on the strip) but the portions are huge! 

I arrived mid-day with a group of 5 and could see many open tables and there was no wait. It took them 20min to seat us and when we finally got seated we weren't even handed menus and didn't see our waitress for a good 5min or so after (but don't worry, she walked by us several times). We were clearly hungry so we ended up grabbing our own menu's so that when we saw our waitress we could order right away. 

No free drink refills or chip refills but what they fail to mention is the large portions.. Would have been nice to know so we didn't order/waste all this food. 

The food is great though and the chefs are wonderful at accommodating meals to your preference. 

Maybe you're not big on service as I am but I was highly unimpressed with that part of my experience here."}
{"text":"The service was horrible we waited over an hour at lunch and there were only 3 other tables. They were completely unprepared to actually make food. Shocking considering they are a restaurant. In addition it was terrible food. This place is completely over priced on top of it.  Save your money for any place other then this one."}
{"text":"This place sucks dick!!! Bad customer service. We waited forever for our drinks, food and checks. There was a group of people that came in and were told to wait 15 minutes. The place was more than half empty!!! Huevos rancherros wasn't what I expected. 3 little bitty ass tortillas with eggs on top. No beans, cheese. Worthless. I definitely don't recommend anybody coming here."}
{"text":"Bland guac, had to ask for extra serrano peppers, onions, and cilantro to jazz it up. No lime though. Flat soda, request for replacement never came. Tiny  margaritas. Not worth it. Almost empty restaurant with slow service. Disappointed in our first Vegas dining experience."}
{"text":"DELISH!!!!!! Seriously the Grande nachos are the bomb!!!!! The service is great and the wings are also great. I don't know what the rest of the reviews are talking about but this is my second time here and we are super happy will definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Best fajitas my wife and I have had in a while, bartender Brian was great!if u want great fajitas this is the Place to go and they Tecate."}
{"text":"Cindy was a great server and very attentive, she was friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu!! The carnitas salad was delicious I will recommend to everyone I know it was a great way to spend my vacation !!"}
{"text":"Went with a group of six late in the evening after travelling all day, and was impressed by the friendly service (our waitress was awesome...wish I remembered her name) and the food.  The nachos were huge and delish, and there was a taco special for pork or chicken tacos for $2.  They were really good.  There was a vegan and a couple of vegetarians in the group, and they liked the food they ordered (vegan options were slim but she found something :) ).  All in all, we'd go back.  Nobody was unhappy with their food, and a fun waitress goes a long way."}
{"text":"Came to this place on a Sunday with 8 people, it was a bad experience from the beginning, the waitress seem to be lost with our orders, people on my party had order coffee and it was warm not hot, the waitress took along time to do anything, when our food came out all the orders were cold like if the food had been sitting for a while before the waitress brought it out to us, food was ok not bad at all but for the price and bad service I would rather go somewhere  else, we saw people getting up and walk out because they never got any sevice, would not recommend."}
{"text":"Let me break it down:

Service: 2 stars. When we first got there the lady said there would be a 20-minute wait as there was \"other people waiting\" when clearly there were open tables inside. Additionally, the server was nice but we had to ask twice for extra utensils and she never brought them. 

Price: 3 stars. Don't expect complimentary chips and salsa like most other Mexican restaurants -- they dont offer that here (its about an extra $7). Also, I ordered the enchiladas and they were $18 for three...and they didn't even come with a side of rice and beans. 

Food: 4 stars. I'll end on a positive note -- the food was actually pretty good.  Despite the small portions, the salsas were very flavorful and spicy and the tacos were very tasty as well.

Would I recommend? Yes; but only if you're nearby and are willing to spend a bit extra."}
{"text":"I visited Las Vegas last days.
I decided to go to this restaurant.
I waited 15 minutes,before server bring us menu.
5 star that it's work 24/hours
1 star for guacamole-it's just avocado and nothing more,no lime,a little cilantro,no salt!no taste!! I was so disappointed 
1star for salad, chicken was cold.
Also they charging for chips and salsa!"}
{"text":"Best food we've had so far. Very god flavor generous portions. The carne Assad tacos were very good. After 6 meals here in Vegas we'll come back. Not too expensive but great food."}
{"text":"We went in at 2:30am and asked the waitress for vegetarian options and she got the chef to talk to us, which was amazing. The chef asked about our preferences and restrictions and explained how they make all the dishes. It was the best Mexican food I've ever had, not greasy or heavy but very satisfying. The green enchiladas and veggie quesadilla are awesome!"}
{"text":"Wait staff was rude. 
Nachos which serve like 4 ppl were sorry ass nachos. For something that cost $20 I would expect more thank a little sour cream and melted cheese. 
Tacos were okay. But beef is over cooked and flavor less

I'm a chef and to me it tasted like Sysco packaged meat. Gross"}
{"text":"The chips were thick and hard, the salsas lacked flavor. The tacos were soggy and bland. Worst Tex Mex I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"One star because no option for zero.
We were seated promptly. After that, pure crap. I believe all the five star reviews for this shit hole were made by people that either work, have friends that work here, or they actually drank all 40 something shots of tequila then made their review! Our overly tattooed server acted like she was on some kind of drugs. She was confused to what went to what table and took 10min each between bringing menus, waters, drinks and chips. We were also told that there was a guacamole shortage, but yet she brought out this green slime crap. It may have been blended limes with some type of salsa? I think? When ordering they didn't have the items we wanted, so I asked our space alien waitress what she recommended and ordered that. During this hour wait I was entertained by the confusion of the other wait staff. At one point a cook came out and had a argument with our waitress! The manager came to us and apologize for the wait and said 5 more minutes. What deception! After about another 12 minutes I had enough. I shouldn't have paid my bill and left, but my date said to ask for the bill. Instead I asked the hostess to get our bill and cancel the food order. She vanished along with the rest of the staff?? Alien abduction? I left $30 on the table since the drinks were around $15 a piece and I think the chips and salsa were free? I usually don't wait over 2 hours for food, but a previous 5 star yelp review said it was worth the wait. I came to Vegas to do multiple things and not wait all day for crap food.  The chips=horrible! A step up from cardboard.
     Salsa= little less taste and freshness than generic brand at Walmart. 
 Green slime stuff = very unique sour with bitter at same time.
I'm thankful they didn't bring the food, because I didn't risk the chance of food poisoning."}
{"text":"Food isn't good. Service is horrible. You're better off getting a hot dog on the strip."}
{"text":"Great spot...great food, great service.
Ask for Josh if you want to be wowed by service and style."}
{"text":"This is one of the best spots on the strip and if you come here ask for server Shay she the bomb!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place has no idea what Mexican food is there carnitas tacos were sweet and disgusting taco Bell has a better grasp of what Mexican food is and don't get me started on there nachos huge amount of chips but only chicken n cheese on the top 90% chips 10% chicken n cheese ridiculous. Also they said my ID was not valid because it was sideways so no God damn beer."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! It is definitely in the top 3 of Mexican restaurants in Vegas. We were seated so fast and the service was great. The best part was the food. Although it's not very vegan/vegetarian friendly...I made it work. But my meat-eater husband and sister loved it too."}
{"text":"Jason was an awesome bartender. He made us custom drinks and was extremely knowledgeable, as well as entertaining. If this guy is working, make sure you stop in."}
{"text":"I eat here every time I'm in Vegas and it's always a go time and good food!!!! Shout out to my wonderful server Shay for taking good care of me"}
{"text":"SCREW THIS PLACE. WARNING ALL CALIFORNIANS THIS COMPANY SUCKS. Apparently vertical ID's are not accepted because some nitwit of a waitress wasn't smart enough to notice fake IDs and the employers don't know how to properly train their employees. It's Vegas, CHECK MORON. and we are not accepted to drink here. So unfortunately corporate decided that people loose their jobs for serving vertical ID'd 21 year olds. This place doesn't deserve a star. 

Just a horrible, ridiculous company. I hope you loose more good paying customers."}
{"text":"I just had a great meal at tequila taqueria.  Brenda was my waitress she is exceptional in every way.   She made excellent recommendations and made my experience delightful!  She also happens to be beautiful which only added to my dining pleasure! Brensa and the restaurant certainly earned 5 stars!"}
{"text":"If you're in the casino and need a tequila, cocktail, or something else and don't care about service or quality, they're your spot.  Quick and easy.   

There are so many restaurant stops and bar stops with food that ranges from good to exquisite, you can just skip this place. 

Pop over to burger, BLT, Gordon Ramsay Steak.  You don't need bland, almost canned-tasting, pulled chicken.  Grab a drink and go.  

If you want someone to ask how you're liking your meal, go elsewhere too. It's Vegas. You have options within seconds to minutes."}
{"text":"Horrible experience! I couldnt even get seated. 4:30 pm.  only 1 server with 3 tables. Cant handle 1 more?  Asked to speak to mgr and waited but she never came out. Never coming back. 0 stars !"}
{"text":"Worst huevos rancheros I have ever had. Slimy tortillas and nothing but onions. My friend's quesadillas looked pretty poor too. Nice bartender, but can't make up for the food."}
{"text":"Well thank God for Tequila Taqueria. We were a group of 8 that stumbled in after a long night of partying. We were celebrating my fiancées birthday and wanted to eat at a fun and upbeat place. Nailed it with Tequila Taqueria. We blew by the host and kinda sat ourselves...ooops. Andi was quick to sarcastically point out our mistake. At this point we knew we were at the right place. Andi read us the riot act before cracking a smile and introduced us to another server named Kristin.  We told them we were in town to celebrate and they knew just what we needed. A third server named Cindy brought out what seemed like an endless amount of pitchers of margaritas with a huge smile on her face. These three servers ganged up on us and worked flawlessly together. Andi didn't ask us what we wanted to eat..she told is what we were going to eat! Kristin had us laughing the entire time while Cindy made sure everything was absolutely perfect. After we finished eating we were about to ask for the check but Kristin beat us to the punch. Not before Andi and the bartender brought out a special birthday shot for my fiancée. We felt spoiled the entire visit and when Cindy sang Happy Birthday as we walked out we knew we were coming back. Oh yeah, we're coming back all right."}
{"text":"I love the food! Chorizo quesadilla are amazing! I also recommend the California Rita, it has muddled avacado, or the CC Margarita it's very refreshing. I work here and i enjoy eating the food. Ask to sit with me!"}
{"text":"Closed the kitchen early due to a sick cook. Wouldn't have minded except the waitress was dismissive about it. Sounds like someone wanted an early night."}
{"text":"WORST MEXICAN FOOD EVER!!!.  The tortillas were so thick and dry.  The cheese quesadilla was like eating paste.  The waitress was very rude.  All she could say was \"Well, I like the food here,  6 tacos, guacamole,  and a cheese quesadilla was over $60.  I would never recommend this place to anyone, not even my neighbor's dog.  Also, no Total Rewards credit....not a Total Rewards property....even after the waitress lied and said to take the receipt to the Total Rewards desk for your credit. OVERALL...a negative 5 stars for this lousy place....not even a to go cup to take your unfinished drink with you....TOTAL THUMBS DOWN!!!"}
{"text":"I am the friend that was with Evonne L. and Stephanie W.  And I'm having a hard time understanding how I got beef tacos and my friend wasn't able to.  And, as pointed out by Evonne L., having MEAT in a salad that was SUPPOSED TO BE VEGETARIAN is UN-FUCKING-ACCEPTABLE. Oh, and the tacos swimming in grease were a nice touch, along with my Sierra Mist that actually turned out to be seltzer water.  Yeah, won't be coming back to this shithole again."}
{"text":"Small margarita but the enchiladas and tacos were good.  Meat was not dry either.  Salsa was not too spicy not too bland."}
{"text":"Just ate here after having crappy fast food all weekend in Vegas, and it was a great surprise! Food was delicious and it was a great environment. Shay was an astounding waitress and I would definitely recommend her and this restaurant to anyone looking for Mexican food on the Strip."}
{"text":"Worst Mexican restaurant... The service was slow, (they were not busy at all), the food was not good (extremely spicy) and it was very very overpriced. I would not come back to this place as there are so many much better options in Vegas for food!"}
{"text":"Dissappointing dining experience. The huevos rancheros were terribly skimpy: a little sauce on 3 small tortillas, egg, onion, and that's all; no rice, no beans, for $14. Slow service. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"It wasn't a bad place to eat. I think their staff called off sick on Cinco de Mayo knowing they were going to be busy. When we got there at 3:30 the place was filling up with 3 people waiting on everybody. But our food was served hot and in a timely manner. By the time we were have way through our dinner, reinforcements had arrived, one I noticed didn't want to be there by her demeanor."}
{"text":"I was there a couple of weeks ago with my husband and my sister-in-law. It was the best experience! The food was delicious, tacos are amazing, fresh salsa is actually fresh. The deco is wonderful but what made our experience the best was Matt the manager. He is the most kind, helpful and nice person! He gave us outstanding service! If you want good service, ask for him. 
We will come back for sure! 
Thank you Matt :)"}
{"text":"The service is not good in this place. it's just taco but not the food one! you can find the good restaurants in the strip. 

We just paid $70 for 3 foods, 2 tacos and one chicken wings!!!

If you are looking for a perfect restaurant is not good choice!!!"}
{"text":"Went for happy hour, they only have tacos and margaritas or beer bucket. That was find, but we ordered 2 chicken tacos... Terrible! The carnitas tacos were ok, also got the margarita pitcher( which is carafe) way less than a pitcher only house margarita too. Waitress took our order, gave us our food, but never asked how we were doing or if we liked the food. Passed by many times but turned her back. Almost like she knew the food was bad... I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"We loved this place fast service and outstanding food served nicely. It was a bit out of the way but worth the walk!"}
{"text":"Ballys casino has a brand new Mexican restaurant.  We got to check it out on its 2nd day opened.  They have a very friendly staff.  We ordered house made guacamole.  They bring a cart up to your table and make it fresh in front of you.  Excellent avocados and freshly made chips.  This place has over 43 different tequilas at the bar.  If you want to come here for just drinks, this a worthy spot.  You can drink tequila straight up or enjoy an interesting list of drink creations.  The hours are Noon - 6am everyday.  Happy hour 3-5pm and 10pm-midnight where tacos are just $2.00!  So people in Vegas now have a quality restaurant to eat at for late night food.  My friend ordered the shrimp salad and I got the steak fajitas.  The fajitas were cooked great, served with sour cream, pico, guacamole, black beans and tortillas.  They add certain spices to tweak the flavor of the dish.  Tequila Taqueria is a small new spot inside Ballys with access to great tequila and Mexican dishes, this spot for sure is a winner.  I live in Texas where we eat Mexican food all the time and I would highly recommend this spot."}
{"text":"While at the pool we were trying to figure out where to have lunch. Figured why not check it out if we are already in Bally's casino right? So we headed over and it looks fun w/ the colors and decor. What's odd is that it's next to Buca di Beppo and the hostess from Buca sat us at this restaurant. We had hoped they had a happy hour, but it turns out they don't do happy hours on weekends, including Fridays. So we decided to look over the menu to see if we should stay. Our server asked if we wanted to order some chips and salsa. I raised an eyebrow to this as I hadn't ever been to a Mexican restaurant where they didn't offer complimentary chips and salsa. Ironically enough I just wrote a review about another Mexican restaurant and guess what, they gave us complimentary chips and salsa. So the chips and salsa were $7.99. That's one way for me not to eat chips and salsa. Our server didn't add to the joy of our visit either. Here attitude was very condescending. Due to the fact we were starving we ordered a drink and some tacos. You can't select different types of tacos, you get 3 of one kind. WHAT!? They don't even show the price of a single taco on the menu. 
We both ordered the chicken tacos. To which we both agreed were amazing. Probably not gonna be a place we come back to considering there are other good taco spots not in a casino for a local to check out."}
{"text":"Ate dinner while in town for a conference.  I assumed Mexican food would be safe but I was disappointed. 

The service was good and my waitress willingly accommodated special allergy requests.  

But I ordered tableside guacamole and was told they couldn't serve it due to the avocado shortage.  Which is news to me; every grocery store I have been in the past several weeks had plenty of avocados.   So they brought me a serving of awful guacamole like you would buy at a gas station. I should have sent it back but didn't. 

Surprisingly my tacos had a small side of normal guacamole that was acceptable.

My wine was so-so the chips were mostly small broken pieces and the fish tacos were decent. 

Upon more thought it was a bad experience and I would definitely not go back."}
{"text":"Since I was staying at Bally's this was my go to place for a bite to eat.

Had a couple good meals here but the staff was lacking.

The Tacos were pretty good, the margs not bad but a little pricey for what you get.

I was sitting at the bar having a meal and watching some sports on the TV and the bar manager came and stood right in front of me so I couldn't see the TV. Luckily the bar tender pointed out how rude that was but he just moved over and continued to be a knob, mostly hitting on the female staff members.

Minus one star for douchey Manager."}
{"text":"Joy is the best manager ever!! Took really great care of us. Very attentive and was taking care of the floor. She's a rockstar!! Will come back here again because of great service"}
{"text":"Overpriced, Fair to average food, small portions.  Really excellent wait service.  31.00 for 3 small steak tacos, tiny amt of black beans, inedable green rice.  Pepsi and chips."}
{"text":"Service= 5 stars...GREAT JOB Carissa!!!
Food= 5 stars...Nacho Grande EPIC and chicken tacos!
Atmosphere= 5 stars...great decor and bar

This place is a Vegas gem hidden in Balley's Casino! By far one of the BEST values in Vegas and portions fit for a King and Queen!!

CHECK OUT THE PHOTO OF MY NACHO PICTURE!! You WON'T  be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Some of the worse, actually the worse Mexican food I've ever had. I ordered the Steak and eggs with Chilequiles, asked for my steak med rare, got well done,  cold steak, asked for my eggs over med, got over hard. Chilequiles were less than ok. The food is also over priced and not good at all. Also ordered queso fundido, which is supposed to be a warm cheese dip with chorizo, they were out of chorizo, and what we got was what seemed like a block of Monterey Jack cheese melted in a cast iron dish. I don't recommend this place at all. Huge overpriced disappointment."}
{"text":"It's ok for Mexican food. My rice was kinda hard, black beans tasty and carne asada was good, meat was a little tough but good flavors. Chips & salsa have to order, $7. Waitress was nice and hostess. So this place is ok."}
{"text":"So this was our first time staying at the Paris... my wife and I love to eat out and enjoy the entire restaurant experience. The Tequila Taqueria was a good restaurant (3 stars)... but Kristin K made the the experience great! She had a smile that lit up the room and was very attentive. She is the reason for the extra star."}
{"text":"Really good, spicy chicken tacos. Guacamole is flavorful. Good tequila selection. Open until 6am, so it is a good late night stop.

They seemed more slammed than normal when I went, which led to the servers providing the best service possible (and the effort showed), but things were a little sluggish. Not faulting them, they did their best with whatever cards they were dealt.

The cilantro on the tacos was fresh and crisp, a big selling point for me and a lot better than shredded cabbage and radish like one place that will not be named.

I wish they had the typical chips & salsa to start out with, but no biggie. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Was staying at Ballys and needed a quick bite. Food isnt great ( I have had worse) but for the price it would have been better to get a slice of pizza somewhere. The server was friendly enough, but it took forever to get the food ( again came in for a 'quick' bite) It was a cheese quesadilla for gods sake and it wasn't as if every table was filled"}
{"text":"Carnitas tacos and margaritas...craving full filled. The bar may have ran out of patron but like that 1800! Thank you for your quick and friendly service."}
{"text":"Not a fan of the value presented here at Tequila Taqueria. The location is meh. Food was served fast and the service was good, but for the price I paid, I'm not sure the quality is up to par."}
{"text":"Great fun and friendly atmosphere!! Sorry the last reviewer was unimpressed, my experience was 1000% better, very attentive servers, great food! My server was excellent, Tabitha was on the ball and never dropped it!! I'll be back and bring friends!! I recommend the Quesadilla Burger, Wings and margaritas!! 43 Tequila's to choose from is icing on the cake!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Service was beyond amazing. Shay was our waitress and was extremely friendly and made our food dining expierence great"}
{"text":"Cool Taco spot at the lower level of Bally's Hotel my recent stay in Vegas. Very good flavored tacos and drink specials. Good service as well and inexpensive. Definitely saved me some $$$$ coming her for lunch instead of going overboard with my spending trying to eat good while on vacation."}
{"text":"My goodness how can you be soooo slow when there's only 10 tables filled? Table next to us had ordered after us. They ordered guacamole which is made right at your table. They had it 10 minutes before we got our appetizer Took 20 minutes to get queso dip that was like a hard cheese lump. It comes with tortillas instead of chips. When we asked our server for chips she told us it didn't come with it. What kind of cheese dip doesn't come with chips? She told us the chips cost $4 a basket and she would have to ask the manager if we could have some for free-her reason was she would get fired over a $4 basket of chips. Who tells customers that?? Seriously?? We got the chips and they were awful-stale. We ordered the steak tacos and they were supposed to be medium but they were pretty rare. So hungry at this point we just ate them. Probably the worst Mexican food and service on the strip."}
{"text":"The food was really good but the service sucked both times we went there. The last visit there was what really rubbed me the wrong way. We spent 45 minutes waiting for our food (an order of the tres tacos and a quesadilla... not much) and our server came by only once in the 45 minutes to check up on us. Once we finished our food we waited about another 30 minutes for the check in which it took another server to come by our table and ask if we needed anything because she probably noticed how upset we were. We told her we were ready for the check and said we didn't know where our server went. She then said our server had gone on her break and our server never informed us of this. I did not get the chance to get our server's name but she was a brunette covered in tattoos.

Overall the food is awesome but because of the service I have to give it 3 stars."}
{"text":"Best service by Cindy and Tabitha!!! You have to try the quesadilla burger. Great atmosphere must visit! Ask for Cindy or Tabby!"}
{"text":"Average ... Chicken on my salad was dry and there was not enough dressing. Cute place. Biggest drawback was having to pay for chips & salsa. Not used to having to pay for chips & salsa. Hubby liked his brisket tacos."}
{"text":"We visited last night, and the restaurant was not very busy when we arrived. Within about 15 minutes of being there, they became very busy though. I was observing our waitress and how hard she was working. I noticed there were only two (2) waitresses running the entire floor. Yikes! This poor girl was busting her bum, and the great service we got showed that. There were people assisting with food running and bussing tables, but these poor girls were still being ran dry. Great food, and great service in spite of being understaffed. Still, hire some more help! That's not fair to expect one person to serve half of a restaurant. We tipped her extra and I hope she got more help. That's the only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars. Hang in there waitresses, and don't think some of us aren't recognizing your hard work!"}
{"text":"Had food with Brenda, she's always the best.  Food is definitely OK,  service is great!"}
{"text":"Honestly I'm not totally hip to american mexican cousine but im always open to try new things and this being a \"new\" restraunt I figured I'd check it out. When I sat down and read over the menu I noticed that there was absolutly no \"vegetarian\" dishes on the menu, which for any mexican restaurant, american mexican or not, was very disheartening. But its mexican food why wouldnt they be able to throw some vegetables into a tortilla of some sort for me? So i asked my waitress (whom i did not have any type of an issue with at all. Infact the service in general was satifactory) how often they get vegatarians and she said not often so i asked her if she thought the cooks would be able to just but some vegatables into an enchilda. She replied \"o yeah not a problem\". I thought cool, werd, lets do that! So when my food come out and i cut into it i find there to be no veggies at all just cheese. I was real hungry at this point and i love my self some cheese so i ate 2 of my 3 corn cheese filled enchiladas, which werent hateful as far as cheese goes. When i recieved my bill i read over it and noticed they still charged me 16.99 for my \"cheese enchilda\". This i was not ok with so i simply asked if there was anyway something could be done about this because paying 16 dollars for three SMALL cheese enchiladas was just a bit ridiculous. So the waitress came back and informed me that she could take 2 DOOLARS off! Are you freakin kidding me! 2 dollars off. My partner got 3 chicken tacos for 6 dollars. The fact that the establishment was more worried about making their buck then satisfying their customer is just bull shit to me and for that reason they get one star from me and even that one star is because i couldnt give it zero on yelp!"}
{"text":"If I could give it NO STARS I would...looks nice from the outside, the servers at the front are very inviting, but the service inside is horrible...our server offered us the specials, but when the food came out it was all incorrect! I guess the things we ordered were not part of the special even though she said they were...they did nothing for us and simply served us the food...Berenice (our waitress) was nice but she lacked basic knowledge of the menu which ultimately led to extreme dissapointment...over all the experience was mediocre to say the least, the food was not too bad but one could have over seen it if service (and knowledge of menu) was better...definetly NOT coming back and so should anyone reading this!"}
{"text":"This was such a good choice!  You must must must get the street corn!   Absolutely fantastic!   Service was great too!  Pollo fajitas are spicy.  You've been warned!"}
{"text":"This place is the worst ever. Negative 10 stars. 
We came in supporting our Seahawks and asked if we could have the game turned on before we sat down. The hostess said they would, our waitress said she was asking the bartender. After about 5-10 minutes the bartender walked over and changed it to the raiders game. He looked pissed off the whole time. My husband and I left. They were so rude. If you are anti-Seahawks, or not willing to accommodate a guest, please post it on your sign or be honest upfront. We are staying in the hotel for 3 nights. Your restaurant is one we will be telling people who ask us, to avoid. Saying you will accommodate then acting rude and irritated that we even asked is not acceptable. I don't want anyone else to waste time out of their vacation."}
{"text":"My family and I went to this place for breakfast based upon reviews on this website and others. When we arrived at 8:00 AM, even though the computerized sign at the front door advertised an \"all day breakfast,\" the restaurant was dark, and the receptionist for the restaurant next door informed us that Tequila Taqueria does not open until noon. We then returned at 4:00 PM for happy hour, which was also advertised on the computerized sign. There was one couple seated in an otherwise empty restaurant when we walked in. We were informed by a server that the happy hour had been discontinued several weeks prior, despite what was posted on the sign. Don't waste your time here if you are looking for a breakfast or a happy hour!"}
{"text":"I was so excited our hotel had a Mexican food restaurant open all night. Sadly, this place was a huge disappointment. The food was good, that was not the problem. The problem there was the service. We ordered our food, got our food, and that was pretty much the end of the service portion. The waitress that took our order told us the other waitress was our waitress and would continue to serve us. Apparently that waitress didn't get the memo. But that kinda stuff can happen when places get busy. Oh wait, it was midnight and there were only 4 tables and 3 waitresses working. No one checked on us after we got our food. Another table that was served after we had already finished eating, got their check, paid and left before we were even able to manage flagging down that third waitress (that we hadn't seen before she brought them their check.) The first waitress I spotted walking out the entrance (possibly for break) and the second never even acknowledged us. We finally got our check and left and don't plan to give it a second chance. I'd rather eat at Gonzalez y Gonzalez over at NY NY next time.

Update: on 1/8/16 I came back to give them another chance while in Vegas again. Since I work for a not for profit that pushes excellent service, I am always a fan of great service. I'm an even bigger fan of service recovery: when a company acknowledges failure and attempts to right a wrong. The regional manager did reach out to me and apologized for my experience and convinced me to give them another chance. I am happy to have obliged as the experience was exactly what I'd hoped for the first time. The waitress and hostess were friendly and helpful and the food was even better than I remembered. I ordered the shrimp fajitas which comes with perfectly grilled street corn (they have Tajin in the back if you ask). All in all it was the experience I had hoped for the first time and for the price the taste is spot on. They are open noon-6am most nights and I am excited to know my midnight Mexican food cravings have a new permanent home on the strip. I would totally drop in just for a margarita and street corn a la cart."}
{"text":"The Tequila Taqueria is in the Bally's Las Vegas and Casino on the strip. I had a mediocre Mexican dinner here with my family, however the service was great!

I enjoyed the service. The salsa and chips which were warm and fresh tasted really good. The tacos are where the food fell off. The chicken taco that I got was a tad dry. 

I also enjoyed the margaritas. Perhaps it was just some bad tacos that I had unfortunately."}
{"text":"Great new bar in Ballys next to the new Buca restaurant...43 tequilas. Can't beat that....Great menu items..."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food and atmosphere was nice enough. Tex-mex and everything tasted fresh. Host was friendly and our server went out of her way and was quite sweet and bubbly.

We had guacamole, can't deny it's fresh when it's made in front of you! Chips had a house made red and verde. Chips were made in house also. We were looking for a snack and it was happy hour, $2 soft corn tacos. I'm a vegetarian (vegas hates us). So I got mine with minus the chicken... when our server brought them out she said the cook sent me a bowl of grilled peppers and onions since I was a veg, they were delicious and I was truly grateful for them doing that. Something I would ordered wether it be happy hour or not. My friend got the shredded chicken tacos and they were loaded with marinated chicken. She said they were great.

Refreshing to have a personal touch and fresh food! Would have gone back if we had time."}
{"text":"This place is so slooow. Waiter service was horrible, sloooow. We had to take our food to goooo.

Never again!"}
{"text":"I had the Mahi Mahi tacos lunch special. The fish was way too salty. Since I was there for a work lunch, I didn't send them back. Good thing the waitress kept refilling my drink"}
{"text":"If you are from the south, DO NOT DARE EAT HERE. Everything about this place will leave you dissatisfied. The queso was like melted stick cheese. The rice was like Uncle Bens microwave rice. The beans were black beans with feta cheese on the top. The meat was more pink than a large filet. They brought a full corn on the cob with my fajitas. The chips tasted like those stiff pita chips. You can taste the water... I did not have a single positive thing to say about this place."}
{"text":"Chef Shay is no longer there and honestly the food wasn't terrible BUT the place went down hill....the service was just OK, they alwayssss had $3 beer which throughout our trip kept moving the sign back and forth. The manager was basically not there and had his waitresses do his dirty work. I was beyond disappointed bc we loved this place so much last time... Next time we won't be back"}
{"text":"Seated at 6:50. Waitress first comes to greet at 7:02. Maybe that's not too bad but to starving folks that had several delays at airport, it seemed like forever. Food was mediocre, Chevys-like really but less well done. Sangria was strong but not tasty. :-( Waitress was otherwise friendly and super prompt with check. But the outfits they wear were a questionable choice and they all seemed a bit worn down. Ahhhh, Vegas. Coupon from Ballys for free shot of tequila is bogus as it comes thru in the prices! A small quesadilla was $15 with sour cream and guacamole. No sides included. Just a 8\" quesadilla. :-( expected a bit more from them."}
{"text":"A lot of potential, but Tequila Tacqueria misses the mark.  About average food and slow service sums it up.  

We arrived a mid day to an almost empty house.  After getting seated it took about 10 minutes to get drinks orders and menus.  

My party of 4 decided to split the Nachos Grande, as they advertise it feeding \"3-4 Amigos\".  They were pretty spot on, as the nachos tower nearly a foot from the base of the plate.  Sadly, nearly 2/3's of it are just nacho chips.  The outside of the chip tower is drizzled in pic de gallo, cheese, sour cream, salsa, and guacamole, with a heavy black bean base.  After a few initial scoops, the tower becomes very heavy on plain chips.

Wanting to fill up a little more, I ordered 2 tacos from their happy hour menu ($2 carnitas and chicken tacos).  My companions also ordered some other items.  Handling the orders for a table of four seemed to be an issue with wrong orders coming out and some not being delivered all together.  As for the tacos themselves, the chicken taco was garbage, but the carnitas was delicious.  Do the pork tacos.  My friend raved about the Mexican street corn - worth a shot if that's your thing.

Overall, I've experienced better."}
{"text":"Waitress came up to us and didn't introduce herself just \"hey what do you want to drink?\"  I had to ask what the specials were and she blurted them so fast I didn't even catch what she had said.   I replied just a beer.  Our server who's name I think was Chrissy as she never told us (I overheard it from another table) was so rude.  She threw the bill in front of me and walked away! I understand that you may have had a bad day or hate happy hour but remember your attitude and service reflects the type of tip you receive! We only had the pork and chicken carnitas which were decent, nothing special.  The horrible service was what ruined it for me!! I will never be back!!!"}
{"text":"Generic Mexican place. Food was fine. My margarita wasn't very strong. Shrimp fajitas were good and came with elote! That was a nice change. Overall wasn't anything special. Small room. Service was slow. There were empty tables everywhere but still had to wait 10 minutes to get seated."}
{"text":"Came for happy hour margaritas, the $20 pitcher is much less than a pitcher, especially compared to the picture they use to advertise it. We did not stay for a meal, but the chips and salsa with the $6 extra for guacamole were not worth the $12. 

2 stars for a bad happy hour experience, but can't say anything about the food."}
{"text":"Great tacos, decent 2$ tacos during happy hour however our bar tender was pretty stressed out. We had to almost beg to be served more tacos. He wasn't rude but he was so stressed out he apologized a couple times it took like 20 mins for us to get more tacos when we wanted more. Mojito was awesome just the service they are definitely short handed"}
{"text":"Check your bank statement. I left a 23% tip and when I like at my account online, they took a 57% tip. Wish I would have paid in cash."}
{"text":"We had an amazing experience at Tequila Taqueria. Our server was Kristin, she was incredible and very efficient (not to mention attractive)! She had great food and drink suggestions and also gave us ideas of things to do in the city. Very personable staff! We will be returning."}
{"text":"The place was more of a tex mex place nothing to exciting but the food was good. Our server was hot lol but at the end of the day we needed something to ease the liquor in our tummies and this placd was the one for us."}
{"text":"Went here while on vacation it was great had the quesadillas, and nachos great service to, shay was the best highly recommended"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised.  The food was Awesome! I wish there was one near Los Angeles. Even though they don't give you chips and salsa we will definitely come back the next time we're in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Waitress had no hospitality spirit ... no hello welcome, just can I get your drink order? Ready to order? \"No not ready to order I just got the menu.\"

She comes back takes order asked the appropriate questions for ordering and walks away, no thank you or any communication. Chips and salsa arrive and the red sauce was hotter than green and I asked if they had anything milder. She said actually the green is normally the hottest the red shouldn't be. I'll let the manager know.

She came to refill our drinks and let us know the manager apologized for the confusion about salsa but they have no other sauces to replace it.

Waitress brings our bill... no discounts of course. We Wait 10 minutes for her to come back for us to pay but never returns. Finally another waitress walks over to take our payments, I ask where our waitress went she said she's on break (mind you there are about 20 people in this whole place... its 2:30pm and it's dead) then to my surprise a third waitress hand us back our receipts and credits cards. Strange... why passing my credit card around?

 The one simple hospitality phrase \"Thank You\" never crossed one person lips in this place.

We all ordered the tacos and all was just ok."}
{"text":"staying at Ballys so I decided to try this place. What a mistake! I ordered queso fundido and churros. I'm sure you're thinking how could they mess that up?  Well...the queso was a big clump of hardened cheese. Warm, but not melted enough to even make it possible to eat. The Churros were cold on the inside and not cooked all the way through. To top it all off this place is as expensive. What a bummer! Next time I will just make the hike to a better restaurant."}
{"text":"If you black dont go you wont get served, 
the manager was nice but service sucks"}
{"text":"The nachos are very good. I also tried the cheese quesadilla, which was very tasty. The only problem was the server Denise was super pushy for us to settle up on the bill because she was getting off soon. Kind of weird."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located inside Bally's. We stopped in for an appetizer before going out to dinner and chose the steak tacos. Amazing. So full of flavor and plenty of steak inside. Disappointed chips and salsa were not complimentary. 
Definitely a restaurant to stop in and give a try. 
Disappointed we didn't make it back for a full dinner."}
{"text":"I have been here twice. It is located inside of Bally's. In two visits it is sometimes hard for me to give a 5 star review. This time I went alone and I sat at the bar. The last time I sat at the bar too. I got excellent service both visits. The food came out fast and it was hot too. I also like that they have so many types of tequilas but being I had to fly out the night of my second visit I decided to hold back from the tequila rather than miss my flight. (Although, I would not mind that to be honest)

They were not very busy this last visit but they did have guests there but I was the only one at that time at the bar. Then more and more started to show up. I was likely there from 4:00 pm-7pm (maybe longer). The guy that left his shift that day was very nice because I asked him if he wanted me to close out my tab with him first before he left but he told me not to worry about it and that they would take care of me. \"They\" meaning other 2 bartenders. 

The chips and salsa are decent but not the reason why I go here. I went back because of the service and I recall it was good the first time I went. I went with the chicken fajitas this visit and they were hot and tasted good but again nothing out of this world. The price is not super cheap but about right for fajitas and they do give you a lot of food so it is worth it in the long run if you are really hungry which I was. The tortillas were fine. I really wanted a hotter salsa but I love spicy so it could have been spicy to someone but it was not to me. 

I would go back to this restaurant again and try something else the next time I go."}
{"text":"El Magnifico - Phenomenal Burgers 
What makes this place unique is the spices they use and the way they flavor their meats. I ordered the Taqueria Burger late on a Saturday,  and the only drawback was that it took a while for it to come. (A while meaning I opened up my laptop and almost completed an online traffic school class before my food arived. (In their defense, they had only been open a few days, and they were still getting the schedule and menu down, and probably didn't anticipate a Vegas late night traffic surge). The manager personally came over and let us know the situation,  and took care of us.

Our waitress was Cy, and she was very nice, she brought us some complementary snacks to compensate for the wait as well, now it was like thanksgiving. I was starving and the extra food was very appreciated,  but it was their attitude about it, that turned me into a repeat customer.

The food was so tasty I came back the following day to try the Mahi tacos. Nina, my new waitress subbed out a few ingredients for avocado and their Chipotle mayonnaise. Obviously it took longer,  but I wanted them custom made.

Ambience:
It is Vegas so of course there was a big screen TV with the playoffs in the background.  

This is not \"fast food,\" but if you like authentic Mexican food, you may enjoy this restaurant. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The service was very friendly and attentive. The carnitas tacos were to die for!  Cory made the best pitcher of margaritas...where else can you take friends and from 10:00 pm - midnight you get Happy Hour Deals...$2.00 tacos!!!!  Pitcher of margaritas for $20. Or 5 beers for $20.!!  Definitely a must..."}
{"text":"I visited Tequila Taqueria with 3 co-workers because it was in Bally's where we were staying and it looked promising. It was mid-afternoon and we were the only ones there. We started with a happy hour pitcher of margaritas and an underwhelming bowl of guacamole made at the table side. It lacked flavor and for $10.99 a bowl is a bit overpriced. The four of us also shared a mountain of nachos, which could have used fewer chips and more toppings. The chicken fajitas were good, but overall, this place is a bit overpriced for the quality of the food I tried. With so many options in Vegas, I doubt I'd go back."}
{"text":"Just low end.  Having a space in a major hotel/casino does not make a good restaurant, any more than piling on a lot of heat makes Mexican food authentic.  I ordered the steak and eggs.  The steak was meager and not especially flavorful, and the eggs were rubbery.  The plate consisted mostly of chips, that had apparently been soaked in lime juice and were nearly inedible.  In short, the food was unimpressive and overpriced.  Service was spotty.  My suggestion:  skip it and go to the Border Grill instead."}
{"text":"I ordered the carnitas tacos-they were pretty good but they needed spicier salsa.

The highlight of the night was Brian the bartender. He was super friendly and attentive and made sure we were taken care of.

Thank you Brian! :)"}
{"text":"Waste of decent, not great, food.  From the 1st encounter; a non-existent line to place name on a waiting list, to sitting forever at your table for even a drink order...on a Tuesday night at 8pm?  Wow.

After the spouse got over paying $6 for stale, thick, cold chips and bland salsas in a Mexican restaurant, our mahi tacos & chorizo burger arrived. 3 stars for the food but the lack of attentiveness to the customer's experience really detracted from the whole experience. 

Of note: their menu has dual pricing with and without Total Rewards card. As a TR card holder, we were told they weren't honoring the Total Rewards discount any longer...but the menu still states that dual pricing is applicable? Why??  Maybe cross or white-out to prevent advertising error and misinformation for customers...or honor your posted prices!

The leftover burger I took back to my hotel room was still good cold...wish I could say we'd go back but we won't. This was our 3rd visit to date and aside from going in the middle of the night for $2 tacos, I can't say it is worth it with sooo many other dining options."}
{"text":"Went to grab a quick bite after work a few days ago and will definitely be back! Drinks and food were great and our server brenda was awesome- made some really good food recommendations and had us laughing the whole time."}
{"text":"I was staying inside Ballys and realized I needed some food before going out to endure a night of drinking. I checked out the menu at the entrance and it looked like a pretty good deal. Grabbed a seat at the bar as it was just me and they had some MLP playoff games going so it was a no brainer. Josh was working behind the bar and he gave me tips on what I should select from the menu. I got the Mahi tacos (an order of 3 for $11) which were a delight as he said it would be. Nice flavor and a slight kick of spice going on with it...not bad. I was hoping I could mix and match with the 3 for $11 deal, but unfortunately I was told you could only get one flavor with the deal. 
Since I was in a Mexican establishment, it was only right to partake in some tequila. It was hard for me not to as I was sitting right in front of a shelf that is fully dedicated to all different types of tequila. I went with the Don Julio Silver for smooth purposes. 

God spot to grab a quick bite and get on with a night of awesomeness."}
{"text":"Brenda was very nice.
Nachos were very tasty.
I will definitely come back here next time I'm in Vegas!!!!"}
{"text":"The only reason for two stars is the awesome bartender, Archie! He made the visit great with his awesome service! I met him after I was told I couldn't have a table by the hostess Roxana. (I'm a 7 Star, but was by myself and didn't bother to flash the card. It shouldn't matter.) The place wasn't booked up, and it was bizarre. However, she also told me the one hamburger came with a \"choice of beef,\" but she had no idea what what meant. I know, it meant USDA choice. She may just need training. Archie was super nice and took great care of me. I would only return because of him. Churros were also the bomb! Loved the chocolate and raspberry sauce that came with!"}
{"text":"These guys took advantage of us because they knew we couldn't sit down in the restaurant since we were in a rush for EDC. We ordered to-go and they skimped us on the food and made it super plain. If we had sat down to eat, I would have complained for them to make my order correctly. They don't substitute anything and I tipped very well before I even got my food. Not only are they super pricey and the smallest portions for a Mexican restaurant, but the food also took forever and we got screwed over in every way. Taste, price, time, orders made incorrectly. My \"bean soup\" was literally just beans in water. The description said \"bean soup with sour cream, tortilla chips, cheese, avocado, etc\" The only good thing about what happened was they were willing to steal our money and give us subpar food. Not coming back here ever and I suggest the staff and ownership fix how this place is run. Bad for business!! Yuck"}
{"text":"I ended up at Tequila Taqueria while attending an event in Bally's.  We were meeting up with a couple of friends for dinner and they had a hankering for Tex-Mex.  Tequila Taqueria was conveniently located near the ballroom/convention area.  They're right next to Buca, and seem to share some facilities - one of the glasses we got actually had the Buca logo on it.

Unfortunately, the location was one of the only things going for it.  The food was underwhelming.  Nachos came out in a small mountain and looked pretty cool, but were pretty average.  The chicken tacos were pretty dry and didn't have any accompaniments, though the seasoning on them was nice.

Service wasn't the best.  It wasn't crowded at all, but our waitress seemed to disappear after taking our orders and was missing for long periods of time.  Adequate if you really need some Tex-Mex, but there are probably better options around."}
{"text":"Tried to sit and order tacos at 1030. We were told they could not accommodate us because half the restaurant was closing... Even though they supposedly don't close until 12. We stay at Balley's all the time, Not only will we never eat here but it may affect whether or not we stay at Ballys in the future because we were so shocked at how we were treated. When you advertise that you are open until after midnight, you may actually want to abide by that... Just a thought."}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Three of us shared the nachos and we still had leftovers. But our waitress, Shay was awesome. She helped with picking the best drinks and suggested the yummy guacamole. We give her 5 stars."}
{"text":"The food tasted fine, but we had vouchers for free shots of tequila and the staff claimed that you could only have one shot for the entire table. Also the quesadillas are a complete rip off. $17 for bite sized pieces. Definitely not worth the price. If anything get the nachos"}
{"text":"Oh sweet baby Jesus!! The appetizer Nachos was AWESOME! the chorizo burger and quesadilla burger was cooked perfectly. The fries that came with the burgers were delicious. If you're hungry come here but be prepared to walk it off."}
{"text":"Simply put; my wife says these were the best nachos she has ever eaten. I can agree they come close to the best. Huge portion that could serve six. Hat is the only thing we had. The server was polite and it didn't take too long. Next time we are in Vegas we plan to have their nachos again."}
{"text":"It wasn't actively bad. It was far from good. 

They first did not accept vertical IDs for drinking, which is absurd. We managed to support our entirely legal IDs with secondary ones, which is absurd that it was even a question. 

The margaritas we got were almost entirely mix, and left us questioning if there was any alcohol at all in them. The pitchers each filled three glasses -- very small. In all, during happy hour, we paid about $7 for each glass of margarita mix. 

Chips and guac were fine, but also not great. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Great food...awesome tacos and excellent service.  I ordered the taco plate and it was outstanding...like mama's home cooking.  The rice and beans were home made as well.  I know where to dine Mexican when visiting Las Vegas."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT !!! Is it time for Happy Hour yet ? Well if it is or isn't this place offers great food and great drinks.

The chicken nachos will feed a family. The $2 tacos are full sized and very tasty. 

The beers ??? $20 gets you a bucket and there are also drafts.

So, if you need a quick munch break stop on in. We eat here every time we stay at Ballys. 

See you there !!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by yesterday after recommendations, so glad we did. Great food. Adorable little place. Our server Eileen was so amazing. Really made our night. 10/10 will come back."}
{"text":"I don't give a lot of one star reviews on yelp, but wow, this place has managed to be the worst dining experience I've ever had in Vegas (and I visit this city frequently enough). First the menu is not accurate. Romaine lettuce for the salads? Try iceberg with a few sprinklings of canned corn and beans. I'd wager you'd find more nutrients in an old shoe.

One of my friends is vegan. She ordered the salad without meat to ensure there would be no meat products. Surprise! Pieces of CHICKEN buried beneath all that watery iceberg. What the fuck? She also ordered a side of guacamole. The waitress seemed confused by this initially, but then nodded and said she could make it happen. What appeared next was a small side cup of chopped avocado pieces. The same avocado pieces that came in slice form on MY salad. So...when someone orders a side of guac, you just take the avocado that already comes with the salad and chop it up into tinier pieces and put it in a side cup? Fuck that. My girlfriend had to mash up those pieces with a fork, add the available salt and pepper from the table, fish pieces of tomato out of her salad, and take a wedge of lime from the side of another friend's plate to MAKE HER OWN GUACAMOLE. Unacceptable.

PS- The \"cilantro lime dressing\" is not oil based. It is thick like buttermilk ranch with cilantro flavoring. Another surprise.

My other friends ordered tacos, which were so greasy everyone either felt bloated or got a legitimate stomach ache that required pepto bismol after consumption. One girl ordered shredded beef, but instead of saying they didn't have shredded beef, they just came back with carnitas. Um...what if she couldn't eat pork for medical or religious reasons? You can't just substitute a meat without telling anyone until after they bite into and discover it's not what they ordered.

Then they fucked up our bill not once, but THREE times. My poor friend was dealing with a unsettled stomach (from all that fucking grease) while trying to do math for the third time. I can't imagine a worst feeling. \"Do I shit my pants, yell at the server, or try to add up all these numbers again?\" Maybe all three. Sigh.

Disgusting food, poor service, and a perpetual parade of fuck ups. If I could summarize this entire dining experience with one phrase, it'd be \"ho don't do it.\""}
{"text":"Was staying at Bally's and decided to check this place out. Waited about 20 minutes for a table which was fine however was told they were short staffed that day. The 2 servers were hustling to get to all the tables. I ordered the taco platter which comes with rice and beans. I found it really good. My dining partner ordered the burger and was satisfied as well. The nachos were ginormous and could feed a crowd. Service was slightly slow but expected so no complaints. The only disappointment was being charged for chips and salsa. But I guess nothing is free is Vegas!"}
{"text":"Terrible service
Husband is active duty military & my father is a disabled vet. Upon arrival we asked if they had a military discount, manager informed us that he would check but never came back. When the waitress came to the table we tried again and decided to ask her. She says she will check with her manager and let us no....again no response. When the check came, AGAIN we asked informing her that she and her manager had forgotten. At this time she says she will ask her manager. After a short time, she comes back and says \"sorry he said no\". Then proceeds to take our bills and charges the wrong bill to the wrong card. When explained to her that it was wrong she blew it off with a \"Sorry! Have a nice day\". When we decided to address the fact that the manager didn't have the eggs to come to our table and tell us that they didn't do anything for military he says oh, I was gonna do it but that at this time he couldn't do anything because the bill had already been paid and couldn't refund anything. My husband doesn't expect to get discounts anywhere however it doesn't feel very well when someone serves and doesn't even get the respect of a face to face \"No\" and you instead send your staff whom even admitted that he told her to go and tell us because he didn't want to. $100 wasted on BS Mexican. Chicken enchiladas had no flavor, salsa verde simply tasted like lime, and some sort of other weird grass like taste. Only thing that was good were the fries. Will never return and would've walked out had we not already ate appetizer"}
{"text":"We waited more than hour and a half just to get our food..horrible service...the first manager(female) has no customer service skills said the kitchen forgot our order told us we would get drinks took another 15 minutes so we asked for a different manager....Choung the manager handle their wrong doing the way you take care of customers.Kenzi was also great."}
{"text":"Steak taco platter better than carnitas taco platter. (Too much cilantro in one and red onion in the other). Chicken quesadilla was so good. Black beans are bland, green rice is...  huh. Overall I'm just happy to be fed. 
Waitress spilled a drink (shot of tequila) on a kid. She forgot my request for lemon. Luckily the meal came w lemon. 
We only saw her a few times."}
{"text":"Service is terrible! Got there and told wait was 10 minutes. They gave us a menu to look over while we waited. By the way, there is no waiting area or chairs nearby. So after looking at a menu with about ten food items for 15 minutes, we are finally seated and given the same menu to look at again. After about 20 minutes, the lady who seated us noticed our waitress still hadn't shown up so she came and took our drink order. Waitress brought out drinks and left without taking our order. After almost finishing my drink and getting ready to walk out, the waitress shows up. She apologizes for the wait and takes our order finally. I order the carnitas tacos and my girlfriend gets shrimp tacos. And then we wait again. Food finally comes out and the server ask who had carnitas. I raise my hand and he puts the plate halfway on the table and just looks at me like he wants me to grab it. After an awkward pause, I finally grab the nice hot plate and put it in front of me. Really? You couldn't put it on the table or warn me the plate was hot? Wow! And to top it off, the carnitas tacos were not good! The pork didn't taste anything like pork. It was drowned in some sweet and sour type of juice and topped with pickled onions and cheese. How do you screw up something as simple as carnitas? I couldn't eat more than one. Had my girlfriend try the carnitas and she agreed, didn't taste like pork or any carnitas she has ever had. And we are both of Mexican heritage living  California. Carnitas is my favorite, and these were the worse I have ever tried. Girlfriend said the shrimp tacos were pretty good, so if you are deciding between the two, definitely go with shrimp! Or better yet, find a place that has decent service. Hour and twenty minutes is a long time just to order and eat three tacos. Especially when the carnitas tacos taste more like chinese food than mexican food."}
{"text":"Expensive, salty, SO MANY better places to go to in Vegas (also Buca is next door). $14 for chips and guac. Ok as a midnight go-to, but not before going out (unless you're down to feel insanely bloated all night)"}
{"text":"I've had better food at Roberto's taco shop and that's saying a lot.  The 2 stars comes only from my server who was honest and straight up with the prices and food.   I paid $83 before tip so almost $100 for burnt steak fajitas and 6 steak tacos with only cheese.  I also got the trough of chips with the blandest guacamole I've ever eaten.  I'm not even kidding with how awful and burned my steak was.  Beans were terrible (I didn't even eat those) the street corn was bomb. How can you screw up mayo on corn tho.  Overall wayyyyyyyyy over priced for what i received.  Not worth it.  

I totally understand any restaurant on the strip is pricey.  I work for bellagio and yes are expensive but our food is delicious.  I thank the server for telling me not to get the combo chicken and steak fajitas because it was $35 and \"not worth it\" wish I would've listen to my gut and just left."}
{"text":"The food at Taco Taqueria was delicious and at a perfect location! Shay was our server and she was so attentive and gave us all of her time! She managed her time perfectly and was a joy to see good service at the strip!"}
{"text":"We were here yesterday, it was good along with the regular menu margaritas. The next day tried hitting happy hour; only deal$20 Happy Hour Margarita Pitcher. Don't bother it's one of the worst margaritas ever, nothing could save this not even the 1/2 tequila they gave us to make them taste like a margarita oppose to tart lemonade. Not worth it stick with regular margarita menu which starts at $10."}
{"text":"Paid around $20-$25 for some drinks and nachos. It was a lot of nachos but really it was just piled with dressing so after eating the first layer, there were just chips left.

Service was really friendly. Location is okay. Took a while for the nachos to come through but the drinks were served fast!"}
{"text":"Only reason I'm giving one star was because the bar tender was great. Where should I even begin with the food. I ordered the taco platter the meat was uncooked the tortilla was cold the rice was the worst part hard and no flavor. It's the first and last time I come here. Waste of money!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money. Food was sub par and overpriced. Service was abysmal. In their defense regarding service, we had a big group (17), but the food took a long time. On a positive note, they got the kids food out very fast, so kudos for that, big time. That's all I have to say about that..."}

I get to the bar and try to order a burger for my dad ,he ordered the previous night and wanted the same burger  again. 

I go to the bar and ask Ericka the bartender if she could help me with finding this burger on the menu.

I describe it and I ask about a sauce that came with it  .


Ericka was so rude. she clearly did not want to help , she actually would not, and  honestly seemed like she was underlying racist.

I say this because I watched her interact with others at the bar .. she was much more friendly. 

she talked to me like she was annoyed to deal with me and I only asked for help with my order. i was not rude..i did not have an additude. i remained polite.  

she was not polite at all.

I come to Vegas and Ballys all the time. It is like a second home

My parents are diamond members here.

I have never been treated so badly by someone in service at a restaurant.

I did finally get someone to help me who was very nice and showed no problem helping me Robert i  believe.

also note: I did not drink so i was not coming in drunk and obnoxious like most people do in vegas.

I hope Ericka and Ballys management reads this.

someone needs some emotional intelligence training.

how can you be in service and unwilling to help and pretend to have little knowledge of the menu?

I'm just saying."}
{"text":"The nachos and wings are amazing. The service was fantastic and we walked out very happy"}
{"text":"Ever had nachos with no cheese. Dry and awful. Had to pay $7 for watery salsa. Tacos were skimpy and mediocre. Will not be back."}
{"text":"This place has very delicious nachos! The plate is big, definitely a must share item. Perfectly layered and every single item is tasty... the chips, chicken, black beans etc. This plate had a mildly spicy kick, truly delicious!"}
{"text":"Waited a good 15mins before anyone even greeted me to be seated. Then took another 15mins before a server came to our table. We walked out because shouldn't take 30mins for some customer service."}
{"text":"Server was great. Asked if game in tv could be switched and she did. Typical Mexican food but with flare and a spicy sauce that makes you need a drink!

Typical Vegas price range. And again beat the crowd so there right before dinner crowd came in. 

But overall great experience"}
{"text":"Thought for it being on The Strip and at Bally's Casino, it would have been great.. Very disappointing!  Food was cold.... Service poor..After we sent our food back, the server didn\"t check back with us to see how it was! The only saving grace was the Marguerites.  I recommend you eat before you go and have a Marguerita only!"}
{"text":"I have never experienced food this sub par. Unbelievable. This is a 24 hour joint located inside Ballys Las Vegas. I have been alive on this earth for 35 years. I live in southern California. I am not Mexican. But I know Mexican food. And this place served the worst Mexican food I have ever eaten. Good part? Open 24hours. Full bar. Full bar is what you are going to need to swallow this garbage. We ordered fish tacos. Quite possibly the saltiest and nastiest morsels ever created by gremlins. I am not going to call the kitchen staff cooks. Because that means they know how to prepare food. These creatures create the worst things ever known to man. Might seem like exaggerating. If you dont believe me, go ahead. I dare you to eat their trash. Also ordered the nachos. Supposedly meant for 3 to 4 people. They spill a bag of tortilla chips and spray random acts of chicken, crema and bean residue on there and expect you to pay 15 bux for it. These people have no business serving dog food. One star for the full bar and show. The food got a lot of laughs. Harsh review you think? Try eating here."}
{"text":"Kristin my server was so nice and hot I don't remember what the food tasted like. Hahah.  The place is great. The salsa is way spicey so be careful.  The corn on the cob grilled was delicious. The hostess was super sweet and bilingual so if you can't speak English well she'll help you out .  Her name is Arabelle and I think I'm in love with her"}
{"text":"When we walked in the manager (white man) and the hostess (black girl) seemed to be in an argument and carried on with their conversation right in front of my boyfriend and I. Very unprofessional and rude. Once we were seated our waitress asked if we wanted drinks. Our waitress Eileen was awesome. She carried a great conversation, was very sweet, and consistently asked us if we needed anything. We showed up at happy hour. $2 tacos and $20 margarita pitcher. Great price. The food was great...the salsa was bland though...But I am from Southern California where the salsa is amazing! Overall, the food was great & so was our waitress."}
{"text":"Great spot for lunch or dinner menu is very limited but food tastes great, we actually came for lunch and decided to come back for dinner, plenty choices of tequila drinks :)"}
{"text":"Cindy gave beyond great service. She made me feel like I was living a Mexican dream at the tequila bar. She not only made the dining experience fun and exciting, but Her service was on point! We are coming back for Cindy. 


Bring back ground beef tacos.

See you soon Cindy! Best waitress EVER"}
{"text":"We stopped in here to get a bite to eat when we first flew in. It's Vegas everything is overpriced. It's kind of sad it didn't used to be years and years ago. We really like the nachos here they were really feeling and really good. Like I said drinks and food are overpriced. Our waiter was perfect. Fairly easy to get to. And other selections nearby."}
{"text":"Shitty service, waited almost 30 min for 3 tacos (happy hour), and they weren't even super busy.waitress was clueless"}
{"text":"I really like the food here and I come here often, some of the servers are very good and some are not too attentive. The hostess named Kenzi, was very helpful in getting us more salsa and utensils when , after asking twice to no avail. Kenzi was more than happy to help us with a smile"}
{"text":"I ate here a few days ago while passing through town. It was late, I was tired and was staying at the hotel so I got take out. I got the wings with a side of fries and my husband got the quesadilla burger with fries. We get back to the room only to see that an order of fries was missing. When I tried to call to have an order made again, the phone just kept ringing and ringing. My husband had to go back downstairs. It was a pain but they did fix the issue. Besides that, my experience was wonderful. My wings were delicious and my husband enjoyed his burger. The fries.... I wanted more! They were incredibly delicious. Crispy on the outside, flakey on the inside, seasoned well and the chipotle aioli on the side was amazing!!! I'd eat here again but I'd eat in the restaurant next time."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time, not good, very expensive and basically a ripoff. $10 for half a cup of guacamole? Steak tacos had no flavor, Margs were good but weak and small for $11, free chips and salsa? Nope $5. $200 dinner for four that sucked"}
{"text":"We stayed at Bally's and this was an easy to get to spot for quick grub. Get the NACHOS! Some of the best nachos we've had (and we've had a lot). 

We went twice to this restaurant. First time we sat at the bar and I had no complaints about the service. The second time we went, mid-day, the hostess said it would be a 10 minute wait even though about half the tables were empty because they were short staffed. We really just wanted to sit down (the night before was a long night ;) and have a water. We could wait to order...but that wasn't an option. We thought that was really odd.

Other than the weird interaction with the hostess, overall experience was good and we were happy!"}
{"text":"I was craving nachos and ordered the nachos for two. I sat at the bar and the bartender correctly advised me that it was going to be too much food but I did it anyway. The nachos were piled high and covered with lots of great toppings and tasted delicious but unfortunately they weren't layered and it turned out to be a big pile of chips. Somewhat depressing atmosphere in an unconvincing location. Bartender was a nice guy.

Terrible value for $25 (after tip) nachos"}
{"text":"Happy hour = $2 tacos and $20 margarita pitchers! I don't have much more to say, except that the tacos were delightful, and the margaritas were savory. We went here for a midday snack and ate 3 tacos each, but easily could've doubled that. Give this place a try for good eats and friendly service!"}
{"text":"The staff was very courteous and willing to accommodate our party of 11 in such a short notice. 
Food was great! Definitely will go back again!"}
{"text":"Located inside Bally's hotel beside Buca de Bepo restaurant. For a Saturday night when the strip is empty, this place was packed. 

The food portions are huge..at least the nachos were that the table next to us ordered. The food is over priced, 3 carne asada tacos for $14?! No chips, salsa or guacamole included. If you want to have a platter which is the 3 tacos and rice and beans, it's $19. The flavor of the tacos was okay, but if you're from CA and eat real Mexican food, don't bother coming here and expecting the same taste. 

The happy hour seems more reasonable...$2/taco from Sunday-Thursday 10pm-12am. 

Not sure I'll be back for anything but they're tequila selection is huge if you love tequila."}
{"text":"First time eating at this establishment and I will never return. The service is horrible, we waited over 45 minutes to get our food. Not once during our looong wait did our waitress ask if we would like a refill on our drinks. I had to ask her myself....sad. The food is not that great, not horrible but not great. I ordered the asada tacos....the meat was very dry. To top it all off the chips and salsa are not complementary. I guess this is what you get when you go to a fake Mexican restaurant. This is definitely a BAR with food as an afterthought."}
{"text":"Loved it! Food was really good and the service was exceptional. easy to get a table and good Mexican food. You can go wrong."}
{"text":"Notorious mahi mahi fish tacos.. Gross. Small. Flavorless and not worth my time. I told the server I did not like them and he gave me a measly \"sorry.\" Wouldn't recommend to anyone. Ambiance was nice though. Modelo draft special is awesome but the food is less than mediocre. I wanted to try the lobster tacos but the price was crazy and based on how these tasted, I don't think the lobster would have been any better."}
{"text":"Ridiculous Burger at a Mexican restaurant, thanks to our waitress Shay who made all the recommendations for our dinner. We will definitely go back again soon."}
{"text":"Below average food. We came at happy hour and we're not given any menu or any rundown by the staff that happy hour was even occurring. Extremely overpriced. 13 dollars for flavorless melted cheese- queso fundito.  Not fun and about 10 cents worth of meat in a 13 dollar meal. Absolutely won't be back."}
{"text":"Im not sure why in the world this place only has 3 stars !!! It was freaking delicious ! I got the quesedilla burger and it just had the most wonderful flavors . also the bartenders Brian and Ricardo are really amazing , made me feel much better after my flight was cancelled . (keep them around lol) and i am totally not a french fry person , but the french fry swirls are to die for here !!!"}
{"text":"Lousy slow service and my chicken tacos was dry and disgusting!!! Avoid this place at all costs"}
{"text":"very disappointing rules that corporate has established.  It's hard to imagine that they would not serve a 21 year old because the California DL is vertical and not horizontal.  wtf"}
{"text":"My brother in law wanted tacos, so we yelp tacos and found this place. Omg this place restricts your availability for tacos. Only had chicken, pork and fish tacos. Majority of people were whites and asians, we were the only hispanics there, the service was bad food was terrible. Only bright side was the chef came out to greet us and she was such a sweetheart, she's the only reason i gave this place 2 stars"}
{"text":"Ended up here after bad service at another place. It was late on a weeknight. Food was surprisingly good. Queso flameado was great, I had wings, which I generally would never do at a Mexican place, but they were really good; great portion. They have a giant nachos that looked REALLY good. Would like to go back and try. Hostess could have been more accommodating/nice."}
{"text":"The food is awesome. Happy hour $2 tacos a deal you can't pass up and they're delicious! The margaritas are ok. I had the margarita saint Rita and the south of the border margarita which was pretty good. But the $2 tacos and the Mexican corn were delicious!! Squeeze some lime on those suckers, oh boy! The service lacks a little bit at busy times but the manager is very nice and on top of everything. They have happy hour sunday through Thursday from 3 to 5pm and 10pm to midnight. Stop in and get the  $2 tacos you won't be disappointed. This is the second time I've been here and definitely will be returning."}
{"text":"Chicken tacos were terrible, meat was small and it tasted sour, like jerk chicken. Pricey too at $4 a taco. Went in during happy hour but they didn't honor the happy hour price cause of Father's day. The place was empty though."}
{"text":"WORST DINING EXPERIENCE- this place doesn't even deserve 1 star.

So I came here because I was really hungry and needed something to eat right away and boy do I regret ever coming here. First of all the service sucked although once I voiced my disappointment the manager and my waitress suddenly become attentive! I was seated and waited about 5 minutes (and yes 5 minutes is a problem when you are starving and the place is completely empty) before receiving a menu while the hostess chatted away with a waitress or someone. I actually got out of my seat and walked up to her to ask for a menu. Once I had the menu I looked at the prices and everything on the menu is ridiculously expensive but I thought I would enjoy the food anyways because I love Mexican. We ordered Guacamole with chips and it was actually awful. The guac for the price is a slap in the face. The guac has no onions, lemon taste or tomatoes or anything that a real guac brings except for avocado. Literally the guac is just smashed avocado. We literally asked for a cup of onions and tomatoes and fresh lemon and made our own at the table. Like seriously?!?!

I could already tell this place sucked and should have left right then and there but I stayed and gave the restaurant the benefit of the doubt.

 I ordered the enchilada  and my date ordered a burger. The enchilada was absolutely DISGUSTING. Actually, the worst enchiladaI have ever had in my life. First of all, the food arrived cold, yes the enchilada was cold. and it looked extremely sad. They sell the enchilada as having salsa verde, onions and avocado but those things are only GARNISHES. WHAT A RIP OFF!! Three pieces of onions and three sad pieces of avocado. Even writing the review is pissing me off again. I called the manager right away and voiced how disgusting the food was and right away was comforted by the manager who was trying his best not be embarrassed. I thought I would order the quesadilla so that the restaurant could redeem itself. The manager kept telling me the \"food would be out right away.\" but I don't want FAST FOOD- TAKE YOUR TIME making my food. I do not want it under-cooked or rushed in anyway. I rather wait a little while for really GOOD food than have it fast and it be below average. 


The quesadilla was OK but only because they were trying so hard and I couldn't even finish the entire thing because of my anxiety over the whole ordeal. Everything about this place SUCKED and I really hope my review stops anyone from coming here until they get a new chef, a new staff, and change their menu around completely. 

Total waste of $$$"}
{"text":"We came here late around 11:00 PM at night. Attentive and friendly service, decent seating and atmosphere.

The food:

Overpriced.
You are forced into buying combos. You cannot buy 1 or 2 tacos, but forced to buy 3. If you're a mix/match person, not for you.
Quality is decent.
Chips and Salsa - Sauce is spicy, they don't have anything mild.

The worst part - When I was about to order a second appetizer and we decided to just settle with the chips and salsa, I overheard our waiter say under his breath \"yeah, well that's the only thing we have\". REALLY? I thought this was LAS VEGAS? AM I IN BARSTOW?"}
{"text":"I do not recommend this place! The food is bad. The tacos are not good and are over priced. If you are really in the mood for tacos or Mexican food I would recommend finding a taco truck or going off the strip to a real Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"HAPPY HOUR REVIEW:

You'd be hard pressed to find a better happy hour deal (late night too) with food/drink specials on the Strip and the service is excellent.

Sunday-Thursday (3pm-5pm and 10pm to 12am)
$2.00 chicken or pork tacos
$20.00 margarita pitchers

The tacos are a hearty size and they were delicious, especially for the price.  The margarita pitchers were large and strong but, you should ask them to cut it with some soda to cut the sour mix if you don't want to have heartburn the next morning.  From 12am-6am they also have a 3 taco plate deal for $11.99 choice of chicken, pork, mahi or steak.

Items I would also recommend trying is the cucumber margarita (really refreshing and strong) especially on a hot day, the nachos which were a huge mountain and enough for 4 hungry people and the table side guacamole which was surprisingly perfect!

The restaurant is right on the casino floor and open on the front so it is very loud but, hey it's Vegas, what casual dining restaurant isn't loud?"}
{"text":"Was here in Saturday half hour before they opened and let me tell you it was worth the wait! Here from LA so we always like to try new restaurants every time we come and we are definitely coming back here. The tacos are amazing! I got three carne Asada tacos and that was plenty. The chipotle mayo they put on top was soooo tasty. And don't get me started on the guacamole! Prepared right in front of you. We also tried the sangria . We love our sangria so we like to try it everywhere we go lol . It was different than any I've had but so delicious! Overall great tasting food and drink !"}
{"text":"One of the worst places I have ever been.  Went 2 nights in a row and left both times prior to being served any food.  This place is so terrible I will never stay at Ballys again.  It won't be open for long."}
{"text":"So a little hesitant at first but food was amazing sober!!! Tabitha really did a great job of helping us choice tequilas to drink and not just going with the most expensive. Don't tell my mom I ate Mexican food on the streets."}
{"text":"I didn't think you could remove the flavor of food so much and have it still look like food. 
Sorry, I am coming from SoCal. So this was sorta insulting. 

Wait staff was okay. Everything else was fine."}
{"text":"FIRST AND LAST VISIT. 

Food was good.  Service by Nina was very good.  I REFUSE TO PAY $7.00 for chips and salsa in a Mexican restaurant.  My $18 salad should have more than covered the cost of a few chips. 

I have never paid for bread which accompanies most full meals in any restaurant.  Not about to pay for chips. 

Too many excellent Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas which do not charge for chips and salsa:   Juan's Flaming Fajitas, Ricardo's, Javier's, Casa Don Juan"}
{"text":"This place has huge potential. Came in around 10 o'clock mid week and not many people in here. Although our server was very friendly, the service was excruciatingly slowwwww. We each ordered a drink off the menu and found them to be extraordinarily sweet. Would not order those again. However, they do have a pretty lengthy tequila list. Fabulous! 

We both ordered fajitas. Shrimp for me and a chicken/steak mix for him. I had an extremely generous portion of shrimp. Impressive! We were both blown away by the quality and taste of the food. We were not expecting such a great meal after the sub-par service. The fajitas came with Mexican corn (a personal favorite), plenty of tortillas, and black beans which were a little too salty, but my only small complaint.

I would return because I thought he food was that awesome. If they stepped up their servie game, this place could be outta this world!"}
{"text":"Nice little place inside Bally's. The waitress Shay was the best. The food was good and the ambiance was great. Worth a visit."}
{"text":"stopped in here for a quick bite with my girlfriend. They have a happy hour early evening, but also from 10-12 at night...ordered 3 chicken tacos on the happy hour menu...they were good but not great. What really shined were the fish tacos...3/11$, they were excellent! Tasty fish with a kick and a cole slaw topping that made them fantastic! Highly recommend them!"}
{"text":"Excellent Nachos! My husband and I shared the platter and there was more than enough for 2 of us. Each layer had ingredients and plenty of flavor !!

Unfortunately, we are at the bar and had what I would call mediocre service. Just gave us food - didn't mingle -barely checked in our drinks. The service is what drove the 3 star rating."}
{"text":"We ended up stopping in here, it was late after a show and we did not want a big meal.   Of all the places we could have stopped this was a poor choice.   We got the steak tacos over the pork because of the waitress recommendation.   The tacos were dry, steak was not tender and had no redeeming quality.  Also, probably the smallest tacos we have ever had.   I do not recommend stopping here at all.  The marketing inside Ballys is big on this place, but not worth it"}
{"text":"Decently priced beers for being on the strip. Food was all cooked perfectly. I was pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Had great service and great food! I recommend the quesadilla burger and cucumber cilantro lime marg. Both the bomb.com. Also do yourself a favor and request Brenda as you're server! She was the best! She was fun and made sure our drinks never ran out!"}
{"text":"This place was surprisingly good as I came in with my cousins and we all liked our dishes. I had there Chorizo Burger and it was awesome."}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE EVER. Avoid place at all costs. Avoid Shay the server at all costs. We came here thinking we can get decent mexican food. Mind you our stay at Ballys is already not that great so we were hoping to have a pleasant experience at a restaurant. The only good thing was the free shot of tequila I got and they even tried to charge me for that on my check. We come to the restaurant and are seated and asked what we want to drink. We order waters and we already knew our waitress Shay had a bad attitude. At first we order mahi tacos which were $20 and were street tacos and wanted to order a salad on the side. We told our waitress, Shay the one you should be avoiding, that we have dietary restrictions. We do not eat meat and shellfish. Right when we said that it went all downhill. She was so rude and said she couldn't accommodate our request to substitute meat or shellfish for mahi mahi on the salad. She said that I already know if I ask they will not do it for you. After that encounter she wouldn't even acknowledge our presence. I had to call the manager over and tell him how rude she was. He was nicer and somewhat more accommodating. He let us order nachos instead and let us put mahi mahi on the nachos instead of chicken. That made my experience a little bit better. What put the cherry on top was when we got the bill and they charged us for the few pieces of mahi mahi on the nachos. I thought it was a substitution not an extra charge. In addition, the quality of the nachos were not good and my companions and I had a severe stomach ache that night. I came to Vegas to go to the clubs and instead I had to spend the night in the morning. Would not ever come back here again."}
{"text":"SHAY was so sweet and had the best personality!! Had a great time here, service was great and food was awesome!! Thanks again shay :)"}
{"text":"The food is disgusting. I had the table side guacamole, which was not good. Too much lime and I felt sick the rest of the night. I rarely not feel well from eating food out, this did not sit well. Recommend avoiding this place"}
{"text":"The drinks were cold and the food was too. It's a good thing they use that canned nacho cheese sauce and serve it room temp, it's craptastic. No for real, this place has huge potential, but missed it badly. Sorry guys, you need help. Drinks were cold, that is all."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service from the moment you walk in. Our waitress SHAY was awesome!!! Recommended the tacos and they were just how they looked \"delicious\" the drinks food and service was all perfect. We will be coming back for sure and hope Shay helps us again!"}
{"text":"2/23/17

Server:  Cindy

Ok , where do I start?

Because of the earlier reviews I came in not expecting much.

We saw they had some jello shots for 3 dollars and souvenir light up shot glasses for $9.95.
We started off with Two shots of the Tijuana Taxis and also had the cherry jello shots.

The Tijuana Taxi shots were good and strong. The jello shots tasted more like jello but it could of been because we just downed two strong shots. 

After scanning the menu, we decided of the tacos, my wife had the shrimp and I had the carna asada. I was pleasantly surprised on how good the carna asada was. it tasted like it was marinated. The tortillas were basic but the flavored meat made the taco!

The staff was friendly and it wasn't too busy. For two taco plates and 4 shots it was only $58.00!!

We would definitely consider eating here again."}
{"text":"I stayed at ballys and ate here twice. I loved everything I tried. Steak tacos were amazing as well as the chicken enchiladas and street corn. The restaurant is basic just by the casino in the hotel but this place is definitely worthy to just grab some food to go or for late night."}
{"text":"Took forever. Food decent. Didnt take coupons for free tequila shots. More expensive than expected."}
{"text":"Food was ok... nothing spectacular...fresh guacamole but had no flavor...we had to add salt and pepper to make it edible..shredded pork tacos we're good but coming from Miami it just didn't have that flavor and spices we were used to."}
{"text":"Chicken tacos were good. Chips and salsa were 7.99. The place is super overpriced. I asked if I could get different  tacos on my plate and she said nope had to stick to just one kind.  Place did not have a fun vibe but had decent food."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. Over priced like any of the casino resorts. $20 for 3 small tacos, rice and beans? You can order just the tacos a la carte for $12. A better deal if you don't want the sides. The food was pretty good. The salsa verde was tasty. Slow service at the bar. They really didn't seem to give a crap to be honest. They kept giving everyone the wrong food. I got free chips and salsa out of it."}
{"text":"If yelp had a 0 star rating, that is what I would give this place. Anything they give will be charged extra, chips, guacamole that's 7 dollars for half a cup. Plus this place doesn't even have horchata or red sauce. When the waitress told us this place was americanized my family should have run to the hills. Thanks for charging 100+ for enchilada plate, fajita plate, and shrimp tacos that tasted like it was microwaved. Fajitas weren't even steaming. Lemonade tasted like watered down powerade looking medicine.

If I had one good thing to say about this place is the water tasted good. Thaaaaaank you"}
{"text":"Cory greeted us and provided the amazing costumer service that every client deserves and James and Shay made sure our experience at the restaurant was unforgettable!! Aaaaamaaazing Service!! We loveeed it!! 
We will definitely return and also suggest family and friends."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here before we went to The Little Vegas Chapel to get married ha! It was seriously the best meal we ate all weekend. The carnitas taco platter and corn are out of this world."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a ridiculous policy to not serve alcohol to anyone with a vertical driver's license even if they are 21 years old or older. I don't even understand how a place can even exist in Las Vegas and within a casino of all places, with such a rule. Don't even bother, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Perfect for late late night!! Tacos were top notch! Service was quick as well. Definitely would recommend this place if you're staying at Bally's, idk if I would walk all the way here if I wasn't staying there"}
{"text":"Had the nachos Grande and it was huge. However, some chips were stale and meat was kinda cold (this was after midnight). The waitresses were nice. Overall, the place is okay."}
{"text":"Way over priced for the quality of food. Service was sub par and we were one of 3 couples in the place. Our server came up to us and asked if we would like dessert, BEFORE we had been served dinner... Complete lack of attention."}
{"text":"Rating this place 2 stars for their poor customer service. We came in and had to seat ourselves and waited over 20 minutes just for a server. The only thing great about this place is the food."}
{"text":"The food was awesome! Loved the nachos! The service was awesome Brenda is very cheerful which made for a great experience! We will be back!"}
{"text":"As I was walking around the casino I spotted a bar across the way they greeted me very friendly served me right away, drinks and food amazing on time and prompt, sitting at the bar was a bit annoying because the lighting was annoying and didn't match the rest of the bar, that aside, go here have a drink, love it"}
{"text":"Been here 2 times already and the food is ok, just not my favorite.

This place is located in Ballys (next to Buca, BLT Steak)

I'm guessing the food is American with Southwestern flavors,  but a bit spicy for me.

I ordered the Tres Tacos, and got one of each.  Presentation beautiful, but the chicken was bland and covered in a mild spicy sauce. Beef was good, but had spicy sauces.

The second time I ordered a Burger. It was huge, but fast, but still not my favorite.

The bar is at the back of the restaurant, and on my second visit, was a louf party of 4.  They were talking to each other, but yelling. I could see customers looking at the bar.  They were so loud, I had to make my order togo. 

Service was good and staff friendly.

Bar is casual.

Price range -$$"}
{"text":"The quesadillas were good. I had shrimp & my friend had chicken. We'd eat those again. The strawberry margarita was weak. But, the service was good."}
{"text":"Wouldn't accept my brand new vertical California drivers license. Enough said. This is the worst place in Vegas."}
{"text":"My first and last time trying this place! HORRIBLE service! ALL staff was rude and seemed as though we were bothering them by being in the restaurant. Food is mediocre but EXTREMELY over priced. Tacos had little meat and were dry. I asked for some sauce or salsa for the tacos and was told I had to pay an extra $2 for salsa. You would think paying $14 for 3 little tacos with little meat ( no rice no beans that was also extra) would come with salsa. Happy hour starts at 10pm, I was there at 10pm and when I asked about happy hour tacos the waiter said no happy hour today. No reason just no happy hour today even though it was posted all over their signage and menu. I think Ballys Hotel should be ashamed of having such a restaurant with staff like that in their hotel! 
Only giving one star because I have to in order to write a review. This place deserves a negative star."}
{"text":"Would not recommend. First we had food before I ever got my margarita, it was probably ready earlier but had to remind waitress. Second it was not the drink I ordered and it was not very good. Food was ok, service was not good. I will not eat here again"}
{"text":"We saw how ridiculously overpriced the food was here and the drinks as well so we decided to share the nachos. With tax the total came to $20! The chips honestly tasted like bagged chips and they poured some yellow canned cheese on here. The shredded chicken tasted good but was limited. There we barely any beans at all on here and mainly half of the nachos were just chips. Didn't come with Guacamole and we got waters to keep the cost down. The waitresses were nice though."}
{"text":"I was very hungry last night and it was sort of late, so my mom and I decided to eat at the Mexican food spot inside our hotel at Bally's. When I saw the prices they charged I was immediately in disbelief, because who charges $7.99 for chips and salsa. However it was late and I was hungry so I ordered 3 fish tacos ($20.99), as that was the only thing I could really eat. My food comes out and the fish tacos the size of street tacos and were cold. I forced my self to eat the first taco by drowning it in Tapatio. I couldn't bring myself to even try to eat the others. I let the waitress Brenda know that my food was cold and I would not be able to eat it. She gets the manager, who takes an additional 10 minutes to come out of the back for me to explain the issue. He apologizes and says he will have them make the tacos fresh and should take about 3 minutes. He graciously brings me out some chips and salsa for my inconvenience. That was pretty nice, but I sat at the table adding seasoning to the salsa because it was hard to eat with no flavoring. My 3 minutes tacos took another 10 minutes to come out. Meanwhile my waitress Brenda kept checking on us and making us laugh each time she came by. Finally my tacos came out not made the way I had originally requested, but at least they were hot this time. I managed to eat one taco, then I removed the batter from the other two and just ate the fish inside. I realized it was hard to eat the cold tacos because the batter did not have a good or seasoned flavoring. I think if you are going to charge me $20+ for some Street tacos they should be edible and of better quality. I will not be back here. The quality and quantity of food were not worth the price. Quality really matters to me and dining experience. The only reason I gave them a two was because Brenda our waitress was top notch! She increased the rating from the 1 Star I had originally gave them."}
{"text":"Not worth of 1 star. Service is horrible and they completely screwed up  our order and never came back to the table. Waited over an hour for someone to come by and refill our drinks. Finally got someone to come over and the excuse was they got really busy but the food was coming and the people over there have been waiting even longer than we had. Finally got the food and Manger said it was on the house. We took it to go cause we were tired of waiting only to get it back to our room (@ Bally's LV) and they completely ruined the food and it tasted horrible. It was free but not even free was good enough, they should of paid us.
This place is owned by the same owner of the Buca Di Peppo next to it @ Bally's, don't even get me started on that place. We visit Bally's alot and we will never step foot back into this joint ever!"}
{"text":"Service was horrible from the get-go. Walked in, no clean tables...asked the waitress who said an employee called out which is why they were dirty....

Sat down at a high table only to find it was rickety. Eventually a waitress cleaned off a table which I sat down at and upon ordering my strawberry margarita- the waitress just gave it to me on the rocks (the one time I wanted it blended). Order shrimp tacos and the shrimp was super tiny, tacos pretty cold.

Oh! And i missed happy hour by like 2 minutes which was the time I spent scanning for a table and then being seated at that table.

Super disappointing. Crappy service. Not so great food."}
{"text":"First of all, a fantastic waitress! Shay is awesome, super friendly and helpful, also funny. Great service. The best steak tacos I have ever had; served super fast. Thank you for a great experience."}
{"text":"Excellent table side guacamole.  Although not much of accommodation for vegans here.  Waitress was great."}
{"text":"We decided to eat here because it was the only place open. It did not disappoint. We skipped the margaritas but want to go back to try them. Our plates of food were huge for the low price we paid. Chips and salsa were unlimited. A great place to stop at anytime."}
{"text":"Place is really a quick non authentic Mexican. Chicken tacos are bland, enchiladas (green) were tacos that are flip half way not rolled. Green guac dip for the chips is too lemony, the only thing good from this place are the chips and water. It took forever to actually get our food a party of 8....yes 8 with a different serve had there food served before us? how we ordered 6 tacos and echiladas took about 20 min for our food to come. I mean just come DURING HAPPY hour waste less..."}
