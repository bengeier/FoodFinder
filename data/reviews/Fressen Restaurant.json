{"text":"IMO, Fressen is the best vegan restaurant in the city, hands down, at least for dinner.  

The atmosphere is wonderful - dark and warm and friendly.  I had the beer-battered tofu for my main and it was PHENOMENAL.  

The service was also wonderful.    I have never had a bad experience here and it will always be my go-to special occasion place."}
{"text":"The food is always great but the service ranges from mediocre to downright abominable. The blonde waitress is one of the rudest servers I've experienced in Toronto. After waiting 10mins without being acknowledged I asked her as she was passing by if she could get me some water when she had a minute. She has the nerve to say 'I don't have a minute but when I do I'll be with you'. That's the kind of service that makes you blacklist a perfectly great restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is so cute and cozy. It was nice to dine in a vegan eatery that felt like a \"regular\" restaurant. 

I was happy they had good beer choices. We went for the Mill Street Organic Pilsner, which was great with the food. We had the eggplant rollatini and the polenta with mushrooms, spinach, and balsamic for appetizers. Both dishes were delicious. I chose the crusted tempeh with veggies for my entree. The tempeh was so good! Deep fried tempeh? Had never even thought of it. Very generous with veggies, and there was a delicious au ju (I even asked for the recipe). My friend had the Moroccan Stew. So flavorful. And not spicy.

Great service and warm atmosphere. I want to visit Toronto again just to try other menu items."}
{"text":"It doesn't take a genius to figure out that I don't eat meat given my reviews. Now, I'm not super strict on this fact, and chose to quit eating meat (and it's dirty little brother, milk) because it's bad for you. Plain and simple. Meat and milk are both over farmed, filled with harmful chemicals and hormones and are mishandled to the point where I'm convinced that they are the cause of most cancers. In any case, that's not anyone's business. In fact, I never tell people not to eat meat (au contraire to my previous rant). Generally, if people ask, I say, \"you really want to know\"? And when they stupidly say \"yes\", I tell them because there's blood and puss in milk. Then I watch them finish their milkshakes all disgusted.

All jokes aside, I usually avoid vegetarian restaurants because I hate vegetarians. They're a bunch of self-righteous bastards. But, when I was totally vegetarian, I longed for proper meals (not modified ones I had to make off menu at most places). So, I went to this shit place. Not only does the food tastes sorta like hippy's houses smell, but it's bland and they have this stupid no-fur policy that drives me bananas.

I wear fur and I don't eat meat. So bite me. I had some girl in leather Doc Martins to her knees ask me to turn my rabbit fur coat inside out if I wanted to come in cause they have a no-fur policy. I guess cows just aren't cuddly enough. I eat three meals a day in restaurants and have never returned since that say. And I never well. I don't mix food with politics."}
{"text":"Amazing Amazing Amazing! :)

Vegan food at its best:)

We have been recommended Fressen by a few friends and finally we got a chance to go there for dinner. If you had ever been to a vegan/vegetarian restaurant you know that most of them have a certain hippie vibe about them. Right? 
Well.. Fressen has no such vibe...it's very well designed- very cozy and cute. Dimmed lights, soft music and beautiful decor. 

The service was great- fast and friendly. We got delicious , healthy bread as we were waiting for our food...I believe they make it in the house.  

The best part about this place in my opinion is their simple menu- order three apps for $15,  and all mains had a set price too...I think it was $14, not sure but it was very reasonable, plus some other bigger size appetizers for $9.   We ordered three apps to share ,  one bigger appetizer and one main ( all these for three people) . We were afraid that it won't be enough, but a friend that had been there many times assured us it would be more than enough. I'm glad we took her advice, because we were STUFFED by the end of dinner. Everything was Soooo Good....absolutely delish. I couldn't stop eating their Babaganush , I couldn't believe it was vegan...it tasted better than regular Babaganush that would have some mayo in it. For main we had tofu kebobs which were great:) 

Overall...I loved this place. My only tiny complaint would be too much vinegar in some of their dishes. ( like mixed mushrooms)  If they fix that I would actually give them FIVE STARS:) Until then, I will definitely be back to Fressen to try the rest of their menu:) I'm a fan now:) 

P. S. Some people complained about service and prices..."}
{"text":"I'm glad this place closed, the food was terrible. No flavor whatsoever. I am vegan and I thought this was hands-down one of the worst places I have ever eaten. I gave it two stars because the ambience was nice."}
{"text":"I've only been once but  the food was amazing (I had the Moroccan stew - and I'm not a strict vegetarian), the service was very good, the restaurant had a nice ambiance, and the bill was very reasonable.

Just wish they were open on Mondays, too!

I definitely plan to go there again."}
{"text":"Too Salty....made my mouth hurt, and my stomach ill.
The food sucks."}
{"text":"I loved this restaurant. It was my first vegan restaurant and my first time voluntarily ordering tofu. 

Food
trio of tapas- 4/5
crusted tofu- 5/5 the sauce was amazing

{"text":"This was a good meal, but not my favorite.  The restaurant is so dark you can hardly see your plate. We had a spinach appetizer which was the highlight of the meal, it has this really yummy sauce.  The Moroccan stew was good, but not amazing. And the blackened seiten was really really black.  Now, maybe it is supposed to be like that, but it was not my thing at all.  Dessert didn't sound too appetizing so we skipped it.  I would go again and give it another try as I love to support veggie restaurants."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong its good, decent food. We really liked the \"fish\" tempeh, the pan seared mushrooms on baby spinach with really yummy sauce and the jicama mango salad. The one star less is for the less than spectacular didn't know what it wanted to be dessert and that there was only one choice of dessert. Their juice (not on the menu) is freshly made which is great so ask them about it! The decor is slightly strange, I think they were going after organic.

I think the other star marked off is more to do with comparing it to Millineum in SF - a high end vegan restaurant. The food was decent  at Fressen but nothing remarkable, nothing that would make me say, I want to go there again to have that one dish.  A friend of ours indicated that we won't find vegetarian as a cuisine unto it self in Toronto, as 1) there are a lot mid level vegetarian places and 2) people in Toronto won't pay that kind of money for it. Interesting. We'll keep trying places in the mean time!"}
{"text":"I was only here for weekend  brunch, so I can't rate the dinner or weekday menus. However, my brunch experience was perfect. All of the servers were really nice and attentive, and explained the menu Nd gave great selections. At $10 a platform for brunch, out meal was actually really reasonably priced. I had the corn fritters which came with salad and guacamole and delicious bread and potatoes, and my friend had the pancakes of the day, which were apple Ginger. Everything was sooooo good. And then we had some chocolate mouse fruit creation thing for desert that I can't even begin to describe the yumminess of. Mmm I made myself hungry writing this review....."}
{"text":"I was really happy with out decision to eat at this restaurant.  It was a bit more than a super-cheap meal, but not over priced.  I recommend the 3-appetizer for $15 deal so you can try a few of the tasty dishes.  It was comfy inside and the food was very tasty - not the usual suspects I'd expect at a vegan spot.  They did not have a gluten-free option for the spreads/dips, however."}
{"text":"Oh, Fressen. I wanted so badly to like you. As a vegetarian, I *need* a place like you to exist. There just aren't that many good quality, tablecloth-ed vegetarian restaurants in Toronto that seat you more than one foot from your neighbour. A friend described Fressen as \"like Cafe Flora in Seattle,\" so I had to try it out, but, oh, she got it so wrong.

First, the good: the restaurant is really beautiful. It's dimly lit, has funky trees growing out of the floors and painted trees on the walls. It feels fancy but also earthy. The servers are also friendly, if a little frazzled.

The bad: as some yelpers have noted, the wait is horrendous. After the appetizers arrived, my mom and I waited for FORTY MINUTES before a waitress came over to tell me that the kitchen was out of tempeh, so I'd have to choose a new dish. Really? It took the kitchen forty minutes to figure out they were out of a key ingredient essential to two other dishes on the menu? I have to take out my Seth Meyers on Weekend Update hat to shout in disbelief: REALLY?!

After reordering the tofu kebabs, we waited another 20 minutes for the food to arrive. It'd be one thing if the food was phenomenal and worth the wait, but my kebabs were a total disaster. Think: massive chunks of tofu, bell peppers and onions slathered in too-sweet barbecue sauce, cooked unevenly, then left on a counter to lose 80% of its heat. I was so hungry at this point, I didn't care. My mom's corn fusili, however, was even worse. It was cold. It was literally cold. So, it was sent back and my poor mom waited another ten minutes for her entree (total waiting time from appetizer to entree: 1:15).

It's clear that the kitchen is dysfunctional. At one point, I looked around the restaurant and noticed that no one in my eyesight had any food on their tables. Everyone was waiting. I also overheard from a waitress at the next table that four dishes were off the menu (plantain dumplings, mushrooms in filo pastry, and two tempeh dishes) - all by 7:30pm on a Saturday. What?! 

The saving grace is that the servers were pretty nice. They were apologetic and took off one entree from the bill for our insanely long wait. That's the only reason why I'm giving Fressen 2 stars instead of 1. The decor and service are nice, but not nice enough to make up for the long wait and passable food. Total disappointment. It gives me no pleasure at all that I have one less vegetarian restaurant to go to in Toronto."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, although some dishes (filo, sweet potato soup) better than others (blini, crusted tofu). But it was some of the WORST service I've had in a restaurant like this. Boooooooooooooooo! I don't live in Toronto, so I can't recommend another vegan option, but I can promise we will look elsewhere on our next visit. (I wrote 'no waiter service' below because that hardly counted.)"}
{"text":"I feel like this is *the* vegetarian/vegan restaurant in Toronto that every vegetarian/vegan ought to chime in on.

What they're doing is ballsy; It's high-end cuisine and decor, the likes of which you'd expect at a fairly upscale restaurant in the city, but it's entirely meat-free (and they have a few good options for the gluten-intolerant as well). As far as I know, there's nothing else like it in the city, and so the legitimacy of a vegan menu as haute-cuisine in TO appears to rest solely on this kitchen. This is my interpretation, anyway.

Before going to Fressen myself, I'd heard mixed things. Some about price, some about friendliness, some about the food itself. In the last few months, I've been twice, and am generally just kinda meh on the place.

My first visit was with a friend from high school who is gluten intolerant. We split three dishes from the tapas menu and a half-litre of wine. She ordered an app, I ordered an entrée - the seitan steak with roast vegetables.

The second time, I went with my girlfriend. We got an app, tapas, an entrée each (beer-battered tofu for me), a half-litre wine, and dessert (mm-boy!)

I have zero complaints about the service. Both times, the people were very friendly. From the person who sat us, to our waiter, to the water-refiller, everyone was attentive and courteous.

The ambiance, as well, is really a step above your Fresh or Vegetarian Haven. Again, I feel like this is Toronto's sole offering of classy, upscale vegetarian dining.

But for me, and most reading this review I'll assume, what matters most is the food. Does Fressen quash the belief that vegan food must be bland and flavourless while elevating the cuisine to a level where it can compete with Toronto's finest restaurants? My answer, a saddened, not quite.
The tapas entries were very tasty, but my girlfriend noted that the hummus comes topped with a few olives, which is not listed in the menu. This would be a nice surprise, if we hadn't also ordered a plate of olives. 
I thought the spinach blinis were excellent. Probably my favourite part of the meal.
The entrées were really the disappointing part, not because they weren't good, but because they really weren't enough to make me choose this place over another of Toronto's many fantastic vegetarian restaurants. The roast veggies that came with both the seitan steak and beer-battered tofu were the same. This led me to believe that they're probably also the same for the skewered tofu. Suddenly the menu didn't look so diverse (I would like to try the chickpea stew though). The veggies themselves were fine, but not necessarily something I'd feel like I had to go out for. The steaks were a little on the dry side by the last few bites. And the beer-battered tofu didn't really blow me away. I like to make my own battered seitan at home, and felt that my homemade version was preferable to this.
I have no complaints about the dessert. Rich vegan chocolate, excellently executed like this, should be enough to convince anyone that being vegan doesn't mean cutting out indulgences.

My conclusion on this place is that, for the price, ambiance and reputation in the city, I'd love to have a vegan restaurant that is consistently fantastic food; a place I can take my meat-loving friends to show them that vegan food can be every bit as good as meat-based food (it can), but Fressen does not fully deliver. It's an excellent restaurant, but not something I crave. Maybe I haven't had the \"stand-out\" dish here yet.

I hope it's been clear that a three-star review here doesn't mean I don't like the place, or that Toronto doesn't have some fantastic vegan restaurants in and outside its city limits (oh, boy, does it ever). I guess I just wanted Fressen to be something it isn't, like my dad wanted me to be in sports. Just because I'm not, doesn't mean he doesn't love me; it just means he's a little upset that he spent that money to buy me soccer equipment and register me in a league when all I was gonna do is stand around and not bother to learn the rules. See how that relates here?"}
{"text":"I'm a vegetarian and my boyfriend and I went there last night. We were both pretty disappointed. Overall the food was really bland. We had some cold tapas to start, fava bean smash and the babaganoush with bread- this was pretty good. Then the mixed mushrooms as an app. There was way too much white wine that is was almost like a soup.. For the main to share we got the crusted tofu. So bland, so boring. Probably wouldn't go back again."}
{"text":"A fixture on the Queen West drag, Fressen serves up gourmet vegetarian fare at average upscale prices.  The soup is always a winner, especially when there's sweet potato and ginger involved.  Try the battered tofu, which is crumbled, has spices and other goodness added, then is re-formed and beer-battered with delicious results.  The staff are friendlier than you'd expect for this neighbourhood, as well."}
{"text":"I was at Fressen last night for a friend's birthday and we had such a great night.  Initially, I was not sure what to expect for a fancy vegan restaurant but I was surprise by the calibre of flavourful food and wonderful service.

The atmosphere of the restaurant is cool, calm and chic.  The dim lights create a relaxing yet romantic environment to dine.

I highly recommend the tapas plates to share as an appetizer (3 for $15).  My Moroccan Stew entree was delicious; but I had to pick out the whole cloves in my meal, which was a bit annoying.  My dining partners also enjoyed their meals.  We were too stuffed to order dessert after.  We did peek over to other dining partons and the dessert they ordered looked super yummy.

If you are looking for an alternative dinner night, I would suggest to check out Fressen.  It is a great place for date night, celebration night out or just regular dinner night."}
{"text":"I went back to Fressen recently and felt compelled to write a new review to give it 5 stars instead of 4.
1. The staff was very friendly. No one was pushing for us to order more food (they did this once 5 years ago).  
2. The main course (beer-battered tofu) was AMAZING
3. They've re-decorated and the atmosphere is awesome.
4. still highly recommend for vegans and people who can appreciate healthy and delicious food with no meat or dairy"}
{"text":"I just discovered Yelp Canada and I am so thrilled because I've been dying to Yelp about Fressen for two years. No, I'm being serious. Friends and I dined here before Second City and really enjoyed everything about it. Great list of cocktails, extremely reasonable in terms of price. Additionally, the friendly staff were more than willing to help my carnivorous friends find an appetizing vegan appetizer worth sharing. I remember that we ordered dishes consisting of cornbread like substance, with avocado and chickpeas. There was this tangy vinaigrette that I still cannot get off my mind. I would highly recommend Fressen, even for the college-crowd. It's affordable and delicious."}
{"text":"The last time I tried Fressen was back in 2006. It took me almost 5 long years to try again; but I probably should have left it indefinitely.

In total, I've been here once for dinner and twice for brunch. The dinner foray, from what I remember (because this was 2004), was a nice intimate evening and the food was interesting and tasty. But what I'm really here to write about is the brunch. In two words: stay away!

Between 2006 and 2011, the general results of the brunch service have not changed:
- slow service
- cold tea and tasteless coffee
- forgetful staff (missing items)
- cost not relative to amount (teeny tiny tapas)
- vegans welcome, but gluten-free diners not

The last time I went, I ordered the soup of the day - coconut butternut squash - which had much more coconut cream than I'd like in a soup, but it was at least warm and filling. I also had a very small chickpea and avocado salad which was supposed to have some greens in it, but I counted three pieces of tiny arugula. My dining mates were shocked at their cold tea. From the sounds of it, the diners from the table next to us were not pleased at all with their food and had demanded a refund on one of their items.

I was very surprised that the restaurant offered no gluten-free alternative options for their sandwiches. Their excuse was that they couldn't find a recipe good enough for what they wanted. Please - this has to be pure laziness. There are so many gluten-free companies and bakeries in the Toronto area. And if they're dedicated to making things in-house, there are hundreds of blog posts online with variations on gluten-free bread that they can experiment with.

Be warned if you go with groups and you want to split the bill. It is the owner's policy that tables must have one bill together. Sure, the servers can split it up for you after, but why not allow separate bills in the first place so that each of us, one-by-one, doesn't have to traipse up to the till and keep wasting their time?

Also, they really have to get with the times: a menu from 2006 on their website? A clear sign that they do not put any care into their image or public presence or reaching out to their customers."}
{"text":"I went in early 2010 with two 2 other females and I was sorely disappointed.  The website menu and the actual menu are completely different.  It's actual menu is far more limited.

With this said, I enjoyed the 3 for $15 tapas we choose but they were skimpy.  The appetizers and mains were a disaster though.  The mushroom dish was very salty, the spinach bilinis were fluffy but tasteless, and the mains (although beautifully presented) all shared exactly the same greasy funky taste.  I couldn't identify it but all the vegetables on all 3 dishes wreaked of it with no other seasoning that I could discern.  Moreover, I was surprised that they didn't offer a salad as a main or appetizer.

I was also surprised that I only saw one dish that had fruit (a tapa citrus beet salad) and very little use of nuts (only walnuts once or twice).  It seemed that they were trying to be cheap by turning to beans and potatoes, and a large number of the menu items were fried.  As someone trying to find something low on fat, I was at a loss.  

The service was great though.  And I loved the cozy muted copper toned interior.

I recommend going down a couple of small blocks to Fresh on Spadina, south of Queen instead.  It doesn't have even remotely as nice an atmosphere and the service is touch and go but the food is superior."}
{"text":"I've been going to Fressen for about 10 years. The menu has morphed over the years but I really love the new direction. It used to be only tapas for dinner... but now you have a choice of tapas or a plated entree. I absolutely LOVE the food; it satisfies vegans and carnivores alike. You get a complete, well-balanced, and freaking awesome meal. The sweet potato soup is amazing and I always get a bowl, regardless of what I'm ordering. The brunch was fab, though they've closed their brunch doors \"until further notice\". I'm very sad about that."}
{"text":"I'm disappointed. Why? Because the food was really good. More on that later, but here is my praise about the food. (deservedly +1 star) 

There is so much selection. The food was delicious. The plates were hearty and fills you up.  There is so much flavour that no meat eater can complain that it's just \"salad\". 
Price wise you can get tapas for 3 for $15 (good enough to share between 2 people as an appetizer), larger sized appetizers for $9, and entree for $14. 
Between myself and my boyfriend we shared 3 tapas, 1 appetizer and the Moroccan stew and it was more than enough. 

My favourite dishes were the Spicy Lentil Balls (the tapas comes with bread to dip), King Mushroom appetizer sauteed in watercress), Moroccan Stew (spicy, hearty, rich, flavourful). 
My friends also had the Portobello Mushroom which they said was too salty. 

My concerns about the food part of the meal:
 - for a restaurant that caters to so many dietary restrictions, I'm surprised that they don't serve any bread/crackers that are gluten free (even rice crackers would have done), so I was forced to eat the spreads with my fork. 
 - the menu online has not changed in 5 years.  granted the restaurant might change their menu daily, but a more current menu could have been posted
 - although the Moroccan stew was amazing, there were hidden olives in it, and twice, i bit down on the pit without knowing. be careful!  

And yet I was disappointed. Why? Because I would like to come here again.  But I could not stand the service. We sat down at 6:30 and we left at 10pm. 

Don't get me wrong, I had a great time, and only because of the company. We literally chatted for over an hour before we realized that no one had asked us for our order.  For an establishment that does not allow reservations between 7pm and 745pm and had to ask permission from someone if I could change my time from 6:30pm to 6:45pm they didn't seem to be doing their time management very well. 

By the time we did order it was about 7:45 -8pm. But the food took forever to come. The friendly server told us that she would bring out the dishes as they were prepared as some ordered Tapas,, some didn't. etc. 
So everything came out on it's turn, but when the entrees finally came out it was almost 2 hours later. Did this mean that the entrees take 2 hours to make? I can't understand it. 

All of this, I don't believe it's the servers fault. She was one of two that had to cater to the whole place. But I do believe more management in the kitchen is needed to get food to people in a timely manner. I have never been in a restaurant this long before! It's so frustrating because I am torn between the food being so great, and the long wait. 

Even though our large party was charged a mandatory 17% gratuity, it was done pre-tax, which was nice because a lot of places don't do that and I get angry.  But here I am again torn because I am paying for someone that just brought my food to me and forced me to wait 4hrs??! 

I would recommend coming here with a big party, good company, and good conversation. With all that the long wait time will fly by. 
I don't recommend coming here with you and your date, because you may get frustrated and leave like we saw two other customers."}
{"text":"One of the foremost vegan restaurants in Toronto, Fressen is dimly lit and exudes a warm vibe that's conducive to connecting with your date or friends.   Fressen provides a tapas-style menu items that provide generous portions and never exceed $9.  This might tempt you into try ing out their entire menu, which is a good or bad thing depending which way you look at it.

Besides being a vegan restaurant, they source organic food whenever possible which allows animal lovers and the environmentally conscious to breath easy.  It also allows Fressen to claim the title as \"Best Guilt Free\" restaurant in Toronto"}
{"text":"Everyone I know in Toronto was raving about the brunch at this place. Vegans, meat eaters, aliens, all of them. I knew I had to try it. \"Try\" is a key word here. I had to try several times to try it because every time I was in Toronto they weren't open. I tried three times with a couple months in between each attempt and they were either renovating, keeping crazy hours, or mysteriously not open during normal hours. Luckily (sorta) the fourth time was a charm.

The real problem was that they were out of everything. Like four things. The biggest rave people had was the waffles or pancakes or something like that but of course those weren't available. I settled on a tofu omelette that sounded nice in writing. The \"tofu ham\" was absolute garbage and the texture of the tofu was attrocious. I can do better in my own kitchen. I tried my friend's tofu scramble and it was really good, though. If I get dragged back I'll try that. The menu was also incredibly short, adding in that they were out of everything the options were pretty limited. I guess if you're only open four days a year though it's hard to ensure you have adequate product to feed the customers."}
{"text":"I've been here many times. Too often to count. 

My favourite thing here is the avacado sandwiches they have on their lunch menu. Its a big heavy sandwich on home made bread. 

When it comes to the dinner menu they also have many tasty dishes. The way this place works is you order a bunch of plates for $9 a plate. For 2 people you could get maybe 3-4 dishes. Then you share. The butternut squash ravioli is my fiance's favourite.

Please note that it will take a while to get your food. I do believe its because things are made fresh. But its definitely worth the wait.

They are usually closed between lunch and dinner for a few hours.

{"text":"In contrast to other reviewers, I didn't have a problem with the service at Fressen.  Maybe that's because the restaurant was not crowded when I ate (around 9:30 on a Thursday night) or maybe Fressen has made an effort to improve its service.  Although the service was good, the food was disappointing.  I enjoyed the coconut-based soup, but my dish of cubed beets mixed with greens was too sweet and the balls of spiced lentils were drowning in oil.  In addition, my friend's sweet potato tart was charred (to the point of inedible) on the bottom."}
{"text":"Yum!  Wonderful food complimented by wonderful service. Not sure we could have asked for me:

-Service: these guys honour reservations and turn people away if they're full.  I could see that really annoying walk-ins, but as someone who had a reservation, I really appreciated that they held it for our party.  We were 45 mins late and they were so gracious about it.  No complaints, no passive-aggressive comments, all smiles! It was for a big group, so we doubly appreciated it!  What would we have done if we ended-up tableless on a Saturday nite at 7pm for 8 ppl!  
-Food: I tried a bunch of the cold appetizers and their pasta special for the nite  The babaganoush and bread was delicious.  The bread was soft and flavoured with herbs and the babaganoush was creamy and smoky.  The chick pea and avocado salad was a great blend of creamy and tangy.  The spicy lentil balls were well-flavoured with a good amount of kick.  I didn't love them, but my wife did.  The pasta special was rigatoni with a walnut pesto.  The sauce was tasty and the pesto added a nice amount of heft to the dish.  

I think the sign of success for vegan food is that you don't leave the meal wishing there was meat on the plate.  When I left Fressen, I certainly didn't miss meat at all.  I was looking forward to coming back to try other things on their menu!"}
{"text":"I'm a convicted carnivore when it comes to dining but given that several in our party needed a vegetarian option we decided on Fressen.

I was very surpised. Great food and something for everyone. Seriously worth a try."}
{"text":"I've been here a few years ago around the time it first opened. It was much different back then- there were fewer cooks, food portions were much smaller, and there were nowhere near as many people dining there at that time, as there are now.

I recently visited Fressen for dinner and it's changed quite a bit. It's much busier, there are a few more cooks, and the portions are huge. The menu has changed as well, and there are quite a lot of options to choose from- I had a difficult time deciding at first, but decided upon the kebabs, which were served with roasted potatoes and mixed vegetables. It was really good, but I think they might have used a bit too much sauce on the kebabs. Other then that, I felt like I was eating a really healthy meal. Like I mentioned before, the portions are larger, so you might want to take some home. They use small fold-up cardboard cartons that don't exactly hold the meal in it too well- so you might want to bring a bag for it. 

The food is kind of pricey, so I guess you could call it a more upscale vegan restaurant. However, I feel that the prices now are much more suited to the portions then they were in the past. 

The atmosphere is still the same, dark, but rustic and cozy. That being said, the atmosphere makes for a good date. 

Service is kind of slow, but friendly. Also, it might be a good idea to make reservations, depending on he day- some days are much busier then others."}
{"text":"After eating at Fressen for the first time I said to my friends... If I had someone to cook for me like this all the time, I could seriously consider a vegan diet. Though I am a huge fan of cheese (perhaps even an addict) I LOVED the food at Fressen (for both dinner & brunch) and hardly noticed the missing dairy and meat! 

Fressen's menu is always changing, but their brunch menu always features a wide selection of comfort foods -- from scrambled tofu to delicious veggie sandwiches to french toast piled high with fresh fruit.  

Fressen is truly an adventure in food! And it's totally affordable!"}
{"text":"Fressen is my favourite 'nice meal out' restaurant. The entire menu is vegan and they clearly mark items that are gluten-free, which saves me from hassling the wait staff and kitchen. I've been here a bunch of times, for brunch and for dinner.

The menu is set up tapas-style, so you order a few dishes to share between everyone. Things come out at all different times, it helps to pace the meal and also doesn't crowd the table too much. They serve bread (which I don't eat but smells amazing) with a fantastic hummus while you are waiting for your food to arrive. The hummus is so good I always grab a forkful.

For brunch I like the scrambled tofu. Really hearty and filling, and comes with greens and veggies on the side.

The absolute best dish on the dinner menu is the deep-fried taro balls with a mango relish-type of thing. I think they are called something more appetizing but every time I go with my boyfriend we EACH order a plate of these, plus other things to share. I only order dessert if someone else will share with me, the gluten-free chocolate amazingness is so rich and decadent I think I would buzz right out of there if I ate it all myself.

Bonus points for really cozy decor, and they have a variety of table set-ups to accommodate different size groups of people. In the summer they open the whole front wall of the restaurant so it is open to the street."}
{"text":"so its taken me some time to get to the point where i have a craving for a vegetarian meal, much less the notion of a vegan one.  in fact, that notion  still turns me off a bit.  so it is with great pleasure that i say that EVERYTHING i had was delicious there.

i was with a bunch of guys believe it or not, none of us being vegetarian or vegan but only one of us who lived in san diego and who also happened to be a chiropractor and the healthiest of all of us, probably combined, if that can even make any sense.  

when i went this time, they had changed their set up to a tapas style restaurant;  great for me as i always love to try everything if i can.  i think we ordered two orders of the mushroom rawzagna which is made with pesto, sundried tomato paste, and hemp butter.  we fought over the last bits of the squash ravioli (go with me here, there really was no wrestling or even anything as much as a raised eyebrow, but we all did like it.)....we chomped on spinach blinis, gnocchi which i normally dont like, and we all had desert, again which was great.

each dish is 9 bucks. period.  easy to calculate, and i think we picked 6 dishes for the three of us (plus our other friend came later and mooched.) and it was plenty.

the waitress, my only complaint, didnt seem like she could handle the pressure and felt impatient to me.  so it costs her a star.

other than that, fress away baby. (fressen means to eat in yiddish, by the by)"}
{"text":"I adore the food at Fressen, but that's where it ends.

The service is the worst I have ever experienced.  Time and time again, it takes so long to get your food and it seems that you can never get the servers attention.

Every time I go to brunch there and order a dish with fake ham in it, it NEVER comes in the dish.  And every time I inform the server about it, they just say \"Oh.\" or \"I don't think there is ham in that dish.\"  Yes, yes there is.  Don't treat me like an idiot who doesn't know what they ordered.    One reason the service is so bad may be because they never have someone working the drink/bar station and there are never more than two servers working at a time.  Look, this is a pretty nice restaurant with pricey bills so why can't they splurge and hire more help?  It's a total slap in the face to the customers.

The kitchen staff are always so loud and the main chef is beyond rude and moody.  I don't really give a shit if he wants to treat his staff with total disrespect, but then at least put a door on the kitchen so when seated within close proximity, I don't have to hear your obnoxious and loud banter.

The food however, when served with all ingredients, is truly unique.  The dinner portions are small, but you are urged to order a couple and share, which I love.  I'm such a sampler and if you are too, you will love this place - you know, besides experiencing terrible service."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian its challenging to make our cuisine interesting. Fressen clearly has no problems doing this. I went with a carnivore to this restaurant and he was able to find  many things on the menu that were appealing and tasty! They had a fairly good selection if wines and the bread was so delish!! The wait staff was a great help in suggesting items on the menu! Overall great experience, great atmosphere and delicious food!! I shall definitely be a repeat offender here !! Lol."}
{"text":"WTF! Why is Fressen NEVER open. It says its open on the website and on the frigging door of the actual restaurant and yet, it's not! I was really looking forward to trying this gourmet vegan food. And now I am REALLY mad. Seems from other people's reviews this happens rather frequently. Get it together you slacking vegan hippies."}
{"text":"As a former meat eater (stopped in 2002) I do like to have options that are close to the flavor and texture and the seared seitan they served reminded me of steak. It was so good I was simply in shock.  When the waitress offered a dessert menu I had to refuse because I couldn't believe they could top that dinner. Quite possibly the best seitan I have ever eaten.

The vegetables were also well seasoned and the pumpkin soup? WOW!

If I am ever back in Toronto, I will make a bee-line to this place, but I will call ahead for a table because I almost didn't get seating on the Friday night I visited."}
{"text":"Vegan/Vegetarian restaurants are all worth a try by me! An inviting Queen West spot with a multi-layer layout and adequate bar seating for a smallish place, Fressen is a nice spot.

The menus is good and diverse and I look forward to working my way through it over the years. My last visit I wasn't starving so had soup - a beautiful butternut squash with hints of leek and ginger and a mixed mushroom appetizer did not disappoint. A variety of mushrooms with wilted spinach in a, hmm, not sure, rice vinegar warm sauce with sesame seeds? Very tasty. 

Good prices and friendly staff made my visit complete. Vegan food isn't for everyone but if you're going to give it a try for the vegetarian in your life, I think you'll be pleased here."}
{"text":"I'm probably writing this review out of bitterness that I can't go there anymore.  I love the food (their brunch was amazing), but had so many bad experiences with snooty waitresses, that I'll never go back. I used to go every few months, but then I had these experiences.
On one occasion, I was there with family and after dinner they brought us a dessert that we didn't order.  We politely told them that we didn't order it and the waitress tried to argue with us that we did and looked pissed off when again we said that we didn't.

Another time my friend and I were eating there and the waitress put our bread basket right into the candle on the table and the napkin caught on fire!  We poured a water on it, but we let her know nicely that she lit it on fire...didn't want her to make the same mistake.  She gave us a dirty look and took the bread basket away.  

The final straw... I took my husband in a total downpour to Fressen via TTC because he hadn't been there before.  We got there and there were about 2 tables of customers.  When we walked in, the waitress asked if we had a reservation and we said we did not.  She explained that even though it didn't look busy, they were totally full.  I tried to ask if she could squeeze us in and she said no.  She didn't even offer us a seat at the empty bar.  She sent us back into the rain.  We waited at a ttc stop for about 20 minutes and in that time only one additional group went into the restaurant.  

I wrote an email to the restaurant to complain about these issues and they didn't even respond.  They just seem to have the snootiest waitresses and the restaurant doesn't seem to care about their customers at all.  If they even sent us an email response to apologize, I would go back, but on principal, never will."}
{"text":"Ok what everyone already knows about Fressen:

1. Its really (in my opinion) the only \"fancy\" vegan restaurant in Toronto. All the others have a cafeteria feel or are a bit more casual.
2. Slowest service possible in the world and just a really lazy attitude from the servers (just ask anyone that frequents this place). But us vegetarians keep going back because (see #1) it's the only fancy place!
3. Their brunch is WAY better than their dinner (but it would seem that they have stopped serving brunch!?) boo!!
4. Decent vegan food. But quite pricey.
5. Enough seating to accommodate large groups, but their kitchen is actually too small to cook all the food, so all your dishes come out pretty far spaced apart. 
6. AND - they refuse to do separate bills. My hugest pet peeve! They just flat out refuse to do it, even if you ask before hand."}
{"text":"awesome awesome awesome food.
this place makes me want to eat this fresh and healthy everyday.
(although i'd definitely miss seafood and meat...)
but definitely vegan friendly!

the avacado chickpea salad was fantastic
mushroom philo was YUM
tofu spinach ravioli was a lil messier on the plate but tasty and crunchy
beet and root soup of the day was good stuff.
the asparagus and quinoa dish was alright ~ didn't like the flavour components, though the asparagus was cooked beautifully.
super fresh fruit on their vegan chocolate dessert plate (i haven't seen such fresh fruit cut up in a whileeee served at any restaurant)
and the cinnamon cha cha tea makes you want to snuggle up in the booth and sit there all night 
the service was EgH~
although food came pretty quick and constant.

portion sizes are perfect so if you go with someone, you can share about 4 or 5 things.  plus dessert and tea came out to be ~$70 with tip.

i left very satisfied and feeling good from eating such good food made with such 'pure' and wholesome ingredients.
large organic selection as well. 
make sure you make a reservation!"}
{"text":"In this case the fifth time's the charm.

I've taken out-of-town pals to Fressen in the past mostly because it's close to where I live and is strictly veg with nice interiors. However, the flaky service and less than riveting menu was becoming a deal-breaker...

Even with reservations and a half-filled restaurant, I was seated at the \"reject\" table 4 out of 5 times- yes, that lonely one by the door that gets the draft and incoming shuffle. It would've been alright if the service was reasonably attentive- distract me with bread, water, a quicker cocktail! But these things were hard to come by. 

The menu teeters towards the tofu-cliché. Are they are trying to entice a wider clientele by lining their mains with the protein most obviously associated with vegan/veg cuisine? Maybs. The food has been pleasant but not as interesting as I would expect from a stylish spot like Fressen. The variety just falls a bit short.

However, faith has been restored after my last visit. I went with a group of maritimers who were visiting for Radiohead. When the show was cancelled, Fressen provided a warm and happy rescue with sweet service, window seating, yummy cucumber cocktails, and dishes to take the edge off. With a little extra love and attention, the experience was no less than enjoyable. Atmospheric affect made the difference (romantic lighting, nice woods, lofty feels) and my pals were pleased. 

I'm still somewhat unsure of how much Fressen is for me, but I definitely won't count them out. My last experience spoke volumes and I'm hoping next will do the same."}
{"text":"This place had a good rose wine that they got from the Buenas Ondas winery in Argentina. This wasn't sold in stores.

Service was rude and very insensitive to my pine nut allergy. The waitress mocked me at some point, which was very disappointing, especially since I brought a big group there for my birthday.

Portions are small and the food taste is very mediocre. The prices were too costly for what they were offering, which was tasteless soy meat substitutes. Even as a vegan I didn't enjoy it there. I'm not vegan anymore, so I can't imagine how omnivores would feel eating there.

I would never go back because of the rude service I had. The food is nothing to bring me back either so I definitely have no reason to return. Vegetarian Haven, Live Organic Food Bar, Camros and Fresh are better veggie options."}
{"text":"I have been to Fressen a few times while visiting Toronto and each time was excellent. 

Both of the last two times were with some omnivore food snobs. (I mean that in the nicest way.)

The atmosphere, the ambiance is excellent. I don't know if they paid one of those $100/hour Feng Shui practitioners or an interior designer or what but it is 5/5.

One of my omnivore guests while looking at the menu said that he could not understand why anyone would choose to eat vegan, boggled his mind. 

First off, they were impressed with the wine selection. Then, the man mentioned above said it was the best bread he had ever been served prior to an entrée at any restaurant. [Haven't always been served this excellent bread on each of my visits, but he was right this time was excellent.]

The sauces particularly impressed them--better than at any veg restaurant I have ever been to. Presentation was also beautiful. Taste did not disappoint. The female designer said there is no way this could all be vegan. Yes, all vegan. 

This is the sort of vegan restaurant you can bring meat eaters to and impress them. 

I can imagine if I lived in Toronto, I might long for more of a fresh sheet of rotating specials. But as an occasional visitor, I would not want to visit Toronto without stopping at least once at Fressen. I so wish we had a place like this in Vancouver."}
{"text":"Beer Battered Tofu - very good.
Spelt Linguine - reportedly good.
Polenta and tomato sauce appetizer - wonderfullll.

The staff were fast on the water refill, and were helpful to us even though we wandered in on Mother's Day (d'oh).  The tapas/appetizers all sounded pretty good, and some of the meals appealed.  The vegetables with the meal were great except for the grossly oversalted grilled greens (and I love greens, sob!).  The tofu was one of the most filling meals I've had in a very long time, definitely for big eaters.

The atmosphere was a little rarefied for us - we're kind of a relaxed pair and it seemed pretty stuffy here.  Could be because we weren't exactly dressed for Mother's Day or something, who knows.

The prices were actually very good - we didn't have anything to drink so it was quite a bargain.

We'll probably come back some day, but there are so many places where we feel more comfortable, it won't be often."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and wonderfully presented.  

Polenta:  nice texture and goes well with the bed of spinach
Grilled black bean seitan:  the sausage(?) was okay (a bit on the dry side, but I like my food non-greasy, so didn't mind it), and the sauteed vegetable was really good!
Crusted tofu:  the tofu was delicious with a bit of a kick.  The non-vegan hubby loved it.

The dessert:  it was the best dessert I ever had!  The chocolate was not too sweet, had the perfect firmness that was heavenly as it melted in my mouth.  The fruits complemented the chocolate and the mousse perfectly.  I can't wait to eat it again."}
{"text":"I came to Fressen with two other girlfriends on a Tuesday night. Walking in, I found the atmosphere of the restaurant much nicer than I anticipated. Ambient lighting as opposed to harsh cafeteria lights, tables with real napkins rather than disposable - what kind of vegetarian restaurant is this?! 

Anyway, we split 3 of the cold tapas plates to begin (3 for $15) - the marinated olives, baba ghanoush, and spicy red lentil balls. For my main (all entrees are equally priced at $16), I had the crusted tempeh with a vegan caesar  ($9 I believe?) to wash it all down. The portions of the entrees are rather large, and I probably would have been comfortable sharing tapas and having an appetizer for myself. As usual, my eyes were bigger than my stomach, and I ended up bringing most of my tempeh home to have for lunch the next day. Although the food was good enough, I wasn't really wowed by anything, particularly the tempeh. The serving came with loads and loads of vegetables and two pieces of hard tempeh swimming in a sauce that tasted mostly like soy sauce. Similar to another reviewer, I felt like I could make a better version myself at home. 

I was a little shocked at the number of reviews citing the bad service here, as I didn't experience any of the rudeness that others described. I found that service was quick and efficient and perfectly pleasant. If I come to Fressen again, I would probably just try a bunch of their tapas and appetizers, as I agree that their menu seems a little...uninspired. I think this would be a cute place to take a vegetarian on a first date, as you could share a bunch of small plates and get to know one another. Judging someone purely based on whether or not they like olives is the fastest way to weed out the bad ones (just kidding!)."}
{"text":"I just realized something like, a minute ago, that I think is pretty hilarious. This is the only other strictly vegetarian restaurant I have *ever* set foot in, and as I did with the other (see review of \"Live\") all I had was an alcoholic beverage.

It was like, 2 years ago (at least) and a friend of mine was acting as DJ (yes, we was dancing, I don't know if that happens there often, I think it was for some specific occasion), and it seemed alright enough. It was kind of lounge-y at that hour, so I didn't try the eats, but...I had an amazing  screwdriver-type drink. All I remember was that it was made with the freshest, realest orange and grapefruit juice I have ever had and did I mention they mixed this with ALCOHOL? The idea literally seemed revolutionary to me. Man, that was a good drink."}
{"text":"As I am sure my fellow yelpers would agree Fressen can be summed up by saying: great food, shit service! I met some friends for brunch today and it took 15 minute for the waitress to come over and take my order.

I ordered the Stewed mixed seasonal fruit under three a freshly cooked berry infused pancakes (it was super yummy) . My food arrived in a decent amount of time but the waitress failed to bring me my coffee (she never ended up bringing it even though I asked twice) and my plate was served without utensils!

Once again kids the food here is wonderful and as a carnivore who enjoys all types of food I highly recommend it ... but like I said don't expect great service.

It should be noted that although I didn't have one today their one desert, Vegan Chocolate cake is amazing!"}
