{"text":"Went: Sun May 17, 9:00 a.m. (70/100)  We didn't think we could get good value for the buffet so we ordered typical breakfast fare. It was expensive, but you'd expect that from a hotel. It was not that much better than breakfast anywhere else, and the ambiance was forgettable. Nothing stood out, but the food was good.  If I had to come back, I wouldn't mind. It wasn't bad, but this is not a recommendation.  3.5 stars rounded to 4.0."}
{"text":"Had the breakfast buffet, it was better than average.  Staff were very attentive and kept my coffee filled.  If you are staying in Delta, it is certainly both convenient and good value.  There is a lovely garden in the courtyard/"}
{"text":"Been here a few times, its fairly consistent for a hotel bar/restaurant type of venue. The prices are a bit high, but expected and the staff are great and the bunch of them have been here for years.  The buffet breakfast is really simple but very well done and the food is always great. Make sure to try and get a breakfast voucher if you can to get it for free. (applies to corporate stays i think).  I have also had the butter chicken, not bad but not what I was expecting.. It's better in Vancouver in my opinion, although the presentation was good and it was prepared with white meat not dark.  Tonight though I had the nacho's and was a little disappointed, the nachos only had a top coating of cheese (which was presented nice and spiced well) underneath its just cheap style chips (in my opinion) I am guessing they may be a normal chip around here, but in Vancouver those are bulk chips.. See the pictures..  You got to love these guys though!  After I wrote this review the manager came by and asked if I wanted more cheese melted on them.. gotta love that!!! Still totally worth a visit if your in the hotel..  Came back again, because I am trapped here in the hotel.. I had the steak sand which, asked if they could do it without the advertised teriyaki and they were happy to accommodate! Turned out to be one of the best steak sandwiches I've ever had. I like that its smaller and the taste was awesome. Upgraded to 4 stars."}
{"text":"Watery French onion soup n burnt pizza for dinner. Not so great here but the breakfast buffet is decent and severs are friendly."}
{"text":"Came to Tivoli Garden for lunch with some clients today. We decided to come here because it's within walking distance from their office.  Tivoli is located inside the Delta Hotel.  The hotel lobby was nice and modern.  But when you walk into Tivoli Garden it's like you're walking into a different era. The furniture and restaurant itself is so dated. But I wanted to keep an open mind. Our server looked mad the entire time we were there. When we asked for water refill he gave us this angry look like we were disturbing him when the entire restaurant was empty and he had no one else to serve.  I ordered the Ceasar salad with chicken and truffle fries. The food was ok I wouldn't say it's amazing. I would say it's your typical hotel food. I would not come back here again with the poor service."}
