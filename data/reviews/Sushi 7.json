{"text":"In the Guy / Concordia area? Hungry and looking to just unplug for it all ... read on!  Atmosphere:  I'm a fan of some quite time - once in a while (who isn't?).  Sushi 7 (the name is odd I know!) - is a quite, secluded, spot among the rush and bustle often associated with this part of town.  The place is run by the owner / chef and one waitress (both Korean) - and it literally seats 12-16 people max.  If you like, you can watch the chef prepare the dishes, or you can relax with a cup of green tea (complimentary) as Radio-Classique Montr√©al 99,5 (!).  Service:  The service here is extremely friendly.  Wether you're there to pick up an order, or to sit down for a meal - a smile is never out of the ordinary.  Food: Good quality, well made, and most of all fresh (big emphasis here!).  You can go to Kanda (nearby) and order the all-you-can-eat meal for $23+ or you can come here and be choosy, and actually pay less; indeed, in terms of value, Sushi 7 is as good as (and often better) than the all-you-can-eat options.  In addition, the chef doesn't skimp on presentation and is often willing to take requests for substitutes etc.  I've been several times (couldn't check-in because there were no reviews! - so here's my take on it).  I think you all will like it."}
{"text":"It was nearly 9 PM when I ventured through the dark to Sushi 7 for my first visit.    I wasn't getting my hopes up, knowing that many \"quick sushi\" places would only have dried-out, premade combos sitting in their display case by this time of night.  Sushi 7 was an exception.  My combo was made to order while I waiting in the dining area, and everything was as fresh as could be.    The service was outstanding.  The cashier/server greeted me enthusiastically, and recommended a few popular combos.  Both she and the chef gave me a warm thank you on my way out, saying they hoped I liked it.    As for the sushi itself, I was pleasantly surprised.  Even items as simple as an avocado roll were well-made, using attractive and generous cuts.  The large maki were varied, fresh, and had great flavour.  The fish was very good, and not at all dry.  I wouldn't say this is the place to find the absolute highest grade of traditional sushi,  but for the hybrid rolls we know and love here in Canada, Sushi 7 is a cut above your average sushi shop."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  REALLY like it.  LOCATION: A little north of Guy Concordia metro (the exit/entrance on St. Mathieu, not the one on Rue Guy). It's hidden to the right-hand side of the street, at the corner. Look up.  ATMOSPHERE: It's like a mom and pop sushi shop. They're Korean, which for me is a step up from Chinese because they don't tend to skimp / use the cheapest cuts to make a meal like in many other Chinese-run Japanese sushi shops. It's very tiny with maybe about 10 tables in total at the back. There are also stairs, so if you have a stroller or something, forget it.  Very clean, too, which is something I look for.  QUALITY: It's OK sushi. I wouldn't say it's high-end sushi grade fish but it is not bad, and pretty decent quality (fresh) for the price.  It was also pre-cut slices of fish.. so don't expect to see a block of it and someone slicing it to order.  PRICE: Very VERY reasonable. I paid about $15 for a chirashi bowl that had 2 pieces of:  Salmon Tuna Eel Clam White Fish Shrimp Squid Scallop (!!!!!!!!) I LOVE raw, fresh scallop. So sweet and delicious.  And a good dollop of seaweed salad (wakame salad).... but there wasn't enough rice. I will order an extra bowl of rice next time.  That is a LOT of raw seafood for the price considering that most places tend to put egg and fake crab on there to bring the costs down. I was very pleasantly surprised to get scallop in there (my FAVOURITE raw seafood to eat) considering the price.  I also got the Kalbi meal which is short rib and found it disgustingly sweet. I don't think that's what the ribs are supposed to be like, but that's what I got. He really went heavy on the teriyaki sauce and.. blearrrgh it ruined my delicious chirashi meal. I should have just stuck to sushi.  To top it off, he also gave me a snack pack of Seaweed Snax (OMG SO GOOD) I love toasted seaweed so this is a bonus.  I'm taking off a star for these reasons:  The Kalbi was awful. Being that he is Korean I was surprised it was so awful. Meat was too thin, overcooked, oversauced, too sweet and too salty all at the same time. A real waste of $16. I should have gotten a second chirashi bowl or more rice.  Service is slow but that's to be expected because it was ONE GUY cooking, running the till and serving customers... Hire someone else, please!!!  I wasn't a fan of that weird mayonnaise and crab piece dollop mixture that was in the chirashi bowl. I am going to ask them to not give that to me the next time and give me more seaweed salad or something.  The rolls and maki combos sounded awful.. I hate it when they add tempura flakes in there, mayonnaise, or fake crab. If I see ANY of those 3 items in a roll I refuse to order / eat it, because it's just.. yuck. Totally disgusting.  He forgot my miso soup :( I don't know if he forgot to put it in the bowl OR he gave me the Seaweed Snax pack instead of the soup.. but either way, I wanted the soup and didn't get it.  Overall I WILL BE BACK. I am so pleased to have found a decent quality (note: NOT high end sushi) for the price, and I am salivating over eating some more raw scallop."}
{"text":"Located underneath an apartment building, this is a small and cozy restaurant (seats less than 30 people). My friend and I came here for lunch on a Saturday at 1-2pm and there was no one.   My friend and I ordered the Hwae Dupbap. My friend called it the Japanese style bimbimbap. He absolutely loved it; while I thought it was pretty good as well. Our server suggested that we put more of the red sauce into the dish to make it taste good. I think I overdid it - because I couldn't really taste the sashimi. (lesson learned)   Our server was basically our chef. He was so helpful and gave us great recommendations as to what we should order. This place has a very friendly and home-y kind of feel. I'd definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Tried this place because it was near my hotel. For the price the sushi was much better than I expected. It was perfect for a grab and go meal. Just FYI if you are American, get cash as our debit cards do not work there unless you have the chip, and they don't do credit."}
{"text":"Great fresh sushi! It's a small an cozy place to go. It's quite, clean and calm. The chef (and owner) does amazing sushi! never had a bad experience. Also, the price is right! you will not over pay for your sushi like other place. You'll get good portion and again, it's all fresh."}
{"text":"Very good sushi! Good price for the quantity and quality. The service is great and the restaurant has a nice cozy feel to it. This is by far my favorite sushi place in Montreal."}
{"text":"This place should be shutdown.  Just spent $30 on two meals and we just threw them both out because they aren't edible."}
{"text":"No good couldn't even eat it all .fish was old tasting and the sushi was strangely warm in a bad way .black avocados very disappointed cause it so close and looks good nice menu. Total let down   . walk the extra street to the sushi place on st Catherine's ."}
{"text":"Great portions. Great pricing. Great variety. Great service. A little low on atmosphere. All that said, if you like very good sushi at a reasonable price, this is your place in the Guy/Concordia area. Don't let the ordinary appearance dissuade you."}
{"text":"I had sushi for the first time this past Saturday, so I am by no means a sushi \"connoisseur\"; however, when it comes to food, I know what I like and I know what I don't like. The sushi at Sushi 7, I like. I happened upon it while looking for a decent sushi place near work, and read the reviews and thought it would be a safe bet. Because I only have one other place to compare it to, it gets an average A-OK from me (perhaps to change once I refine my palette). This place is very unassuming, and when I walked in, I questioned whether I'd be able to sit down or if I would have to take out. The \"dining area\" is adjacent to the cash and kitchen area, offering seating from about 15(ish) people. I found the menu a tad confusing, as there is a placemat with a menu on it (not explaining what kind of sushi or maki rolls you get) or a folded menu. I played it safe and ordered from the folded menu (although it ended up being a tad more expensive that had I ordered from the placemat menu). I ordered one California roll and one Kamikaze salmon roll. I enjoyed both; ingredients tasted light and fresh and I look forward to trying more from there menu!"}
