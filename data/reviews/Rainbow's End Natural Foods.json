{"text":"Such delicious and wholesome ingredients. The most satisfying meal(s) we've had in Vegas all week!"}
{"text":"convenient location, decent selection, prices jus a tad high but for the convenience it's worth it, they have a cafe although I have not tried it, I have heard good things from friends."}
{"text":"Always very helpful & nice staff.. I always have questions about natural remedies or products to be found. The staff is very knowledgeable on products and possible alternatives for almost anything.. the cafe is great and the art work in the cafe changes every month. Nice touch"}
{"text":"This place is great! I moved here from LA, the land you have to try and gain weight in. To the land that seems to be allergic to health food! It was a GODSEND to find a place like this only a few blocks away. It has the store part plus the cafe where I can get vegan food, drinks, and even DESSERTS! (great for that time of the month) Every time I went in they were so nice, although the lady running the cafe part seemed a little rushed but I never blame the staff for that. I like that I was left alone while I shopped. I usually get that over eager sales person or the one that stands over you. No one said a word that I took a water bottle in & out of my purse the whole time, or gave me weird looks, they just let me shop. When I got to the counter they were SO nice to me. The guy behind the counter even realized 1 of the items didn't have a price and tried to convince his manager to just give it to me for free (he tried!). 

For the person who said they didn't believe the A rating and saw a part of a cockroach on the floor, suck it up! I'm sorry, but LA has a very strict health rating more so than anywhere else. I used to live there, and when I moved here I could not BELIEVE all the roaches! They are huge, they are everywhere, you cannot get rid of them. The high end casinos no doubt spend millions on the best poison that gets reapplied everyday (if not sooner) to every nook and cranny in order to keep their guests from seeing them. It doesn't mean there is a dirty kitchen because you noticed 10% of a cockroach in the corner by the trash can! (I've heard similar stories about NY)

And for the girl (and her friend) who said the cafe staff was sooo rude and slow you couldn't believe it, I would take all her reviews with a grain of salt. I looked at her reviews and about 90% of food places she gives low ratings saying the food was bland or the staff was rude to her (if not both). I'm sorry, but if every time you walk into an establishment people are rude to you, take a step back and look at YOUR attitude."}
{"text":"Rainbow's End is a very nice surprise for visiting vegans in Vegas. We went to the cafe inside and ordered the chix patty sandwich and the eggless salad sandwich both on sprouted wheat bread. Both were really, really tasty.  Why not 5 stars? Well, I feel that for the price the portions could have been slightly more reasonable. The staff were also nice and polite :)"}
{"text":"My cohorts order here all the time. But this is MY review. I had a 2-year vegetarian stint and this is a closer lunch option near work.

The vegetarian chili was chunky with fake meat and some what flavorful. The Green Goddess sandwich, ummm... not so much."}
{"text":"This store has such good vibes! Very cozy...you can feel its protective and benevolent energy from the moment you step in! 

Great selection of fresh raw vegan foods and many, many hard-to-find  products such as loose herbs which most health stores don't carry!

Employees are super friendly and contagiously happy...

The star of this place is Karla because she can advice the right remedy/solution for anything that might be afflicting you, she's REALLY AMAZING, extremely knowledgable and the best part is that she's genuinely compassionate and wants only the best for you!  She is A REAL GEM!!! We need more people like her! 

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Amazing store. Decent selection of health foods. Reasonably priced. The cafe is amazing. Great food, good price. The owner said the menu will be entirely vegan very soon. Very excited, it's hard to find great vegan food in the city."}
{"text":"Vegans in Vegas sound like a rare species but one would be surprised at the popularity of health food store Rainbows End. I've been going since I moved to Las Vegas 3 year ago. Frankly, its made the adjustment easier after living in the East Village in New York and having Angelicas Kitchen and other prestigious vegan eateries at my doorstep.. The employees really know their herbs and products. I've discovered amazing products that I can't get anywhere else in Las Vegas including Chi Tea Green Tea It's a great tasting, extremely potent green tea extract that can be added to just about anything. I'll put it in my water  (especially when I'm feeling run down) to give me a quick antioxidant and immune boost, I also first discovered Braggs, Sprouting jars, Chi Tea Detox and they stock top quality Royal Jelly. The Rainbows End cafe is amazing. I'm a fan of the Carrot and Avocado Soup, Cashew nut spring wrap and legendary Green Goddess sandwich. Chef Sharon really makes her dishes with love although it does take along time so I always bring work to do while I wait. I want this  independent institition to thrive against the Fast Food Franchise that infect this corporate city. I urge everyone that wants healthy food and products to support Rainbows End."}
{"text":"Made the trek out here from the strip in search of something tasty and non-meat, and was not disappointed !  The salad tasted fresh and actually contained vegetables other than lettuce and shredded carrots (which was what most of vegas had to offer). The quesadilla was simple but tasty.
It was well worth the trip from the strip to get something reasonably priced and fresh."}
{"text":"VEGAN SCHMEEGAN, JUST DARN GOOD FOOD

OK, so I admit I'm into being health conscious - which led me to choose this place for lunch. Who knew that healthy food now gives those foods fried/drenched in butter/piled high with scrumptious beef a run for their money.

I wanted a Grilled Cheese Roasted Veggie Panini (Oven grilled eggplant, zucchini, yellow squash, roasted red peppers and onions with vegan mozzarella on grilled ciabatta) but hesitated when they said they no longer used eggplant - portobello mushrooms were in their place. Boy am I glad I didn't change my mind. 

I chose a table facing the fountain - quite a pleasant sight and sound, making the few minute wait for the food pass more quickly.

The chiabatta had a touch of a crunch, but just the right softness. The cheese was melted to perfection - how come I can never get that \"balance\" at home??? Stayed soft and runny until the last bite without being too \"gooey\". The mushroom gave the feel of eating meat and the sauce had just a bit of a tiny bite to it. The sandwich was topped with extremely fresh alfalfa sprouts with a small slice of jalape√±o pepper on top of each half. The veggies enriched the flavor of everything and gave the sandwich greater depth. While there were many other tantalizing tidbits on the menu, this sandwich hit my \"eat\" spot so thoroughly that I know I'll order nothing else when I return - which won't be long from now."}
{"text":"If you are a vegetarian or Vegan then you willl want to go
to the Rainbow's End as it has the best vegetarian food
in Las Vegas. Just call up and ask what is the special

will make you a vegetable juice or sandwich to go.
You cannot go wrong at the Rainbow's End"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times to pick up lunch. I've had the Green Goddess pita sandwich each time because it is delicious. The mix of vegetables is well balanced flavor and texture wise. The pita itself is so good that I've bought a pack to take home, even though I know I couldn't replicate that perfect mix. They have many more options that look tasty as well, but I can't stop with the Green Goddess. There is also a plentiful selection of drinks, chips, and other snacks. I make the trip from the west side as often as I can, but I'd be a weekly regular here if it was closer to my house."}
{"text":"Can you name one thing sets Rainbow's End apart from some other health establishments in town?

Community.

Rainbow's End has much of the same supplements, organic coconut oil, and Celtic salt that can be found in other local stores. What cannot be so easily found at other stores is the (authentic) connection to the Vegas community present at this place. 

In addition to a range of vegan and vegetarian dishes, this small store carries a plethora of goods from local vendors. If that is important to you (like it is to me), go in and check it out.  Look past the ingredient list and ask the helpful employees where the products come from.  Look at the honey. Look at the soaps. Look at the kale chips.  The community focus is evident on their shelves. 

I've attended classes about the history or tea and the science of juicing there as well.   These were not throwaway classes, but were highly informative explorations of each topic. They offer a number of other classes that I may never check out (tai chi, tango, vegan cooking, etc.). I appreciate knowing that they are available.   

This is a great place."}
{"text":"If you are into vegetarian and vegan food then you will get this restaurant. If not then you may not get it.  The restaurant is inside a grocery store. Everyone is very nice.  food is always good.  About a dozen or less items on the menu and everyone good. I took my friend who only likes to eat things that are bad for him and he conceded that the food tasted good.  Down home hippy style interior in the restaurant area.  You order at a counter and they bring out the food.  they sell good vitamins and jewelry here too.  I have been here many times and never had a bad experience.  Not fast food but comes out in no longer than 20 minutes and maybe 10 sometimes.  While Vegas has many wonderful places to eat a very healthy place is rare and this is one."}
{"text":"When I moved to Vegas I was on a hunt for a local eatery that served delicious food, had great customer service, and had fresh organic ingredients. Ding ding ding! I've found my place. Rainbow's End offers all of the above and then some. Come for the vegetarian food, stay for the atmosphere and local products. This is a true gem in Vegas. I recommend the Raw lettuce wraps - the perfect ingredients for a refreshing and filling meal."}
{"text":"Love this place...especially when they play that Joan Biaz/type music during my lunch.

They have everything you need here and have been adding more and more stock in their cold cases. I think someone said recently they have fauxs and nice creams added in the cases!

I love eating lunch here. The food simple, fresh, and yummy.

I really love the incense they sell, I don't burn it I just like having it sit around in a vase and the smell permeates around the room without burning. When the smell stops lingering gently spray the sticks with clean cool purified water, a gentle mist will bring them back to life.

While I'm a spoiled girl having Stay Healthy a few blocks away from my house, I like having RE close also because they sell special products others do not order into Vegas.
For example my friends were buying vegan chocolate fair trade Easter bunnies for their kids baskets. I thought that is great customer service. 

They seem to keep up here and there on social media but if you are looking for something specific...just call...they will help you and you can hear the compassionate smile on the other end.

I love it."}
{"text":"doesn't look like much from the outside but boy I'm glad i went in. the health market in the front has all the stuff that does a body good but the food is where its at! You MUST have the green goddess pita. my boyfriend got it for me and at first glance i was like, ewww beets! lets just say... it blew my mind. love love love it! the sauce was amazing. went back the next week and had it again. don't let the little counter in the back of a health store scare ya :)"}
{"text":"Mazzy star playing in the background at a health foods store-- my inner hippie is coming out. 

This place has the clean stuff you can't find in normal grocery stores.  They even have their own stock of dry goods they prepare. (ex= dried no sugar added banana chips, prunes, chia seeds) 

It has a little cafe in there too which I tried, I ordered the \"green goddess\" and it's a pita full of veggies, tomatoes, cucumber, beets, carrots, vegenaise, and vegan cheese. I'm not vegetarian or vegan and I thought it was really good. 

Since it is an independent health foods store, you can expect a little higher prices."}
{"text":"Simply Divine. Period.

First, I must offer Full disclosure and admit that I am by nature a human T-REX, yes like the dinosaur lol. If it breathed at one point in it's life, I probably ate it....sometimes it may still be breathing, but I digress on that.  *cough* ahem.. 

Anyway, 
It all started out when I was leaving the gym in the area. I was making my way via foot to the Sahara Monorail Station.  I noticed what looked like a neighborhood health food store sitting near the corner of Almond Tree Lane and Sahara Blvd, curiously I decided to step in. I was greeted to the aromatic presence of herbs, incense, and all manner of things considered 'healthy' and life-sustaining.  The inner t-rex in me was already bored and was growling for me to leave this herbivore paradise.  But, I decided that I would instead be a little adventurous and let a healthier head prevail this time. I approach the counter at the front of the store.

I received a pleasant and attentive greeting by Melodie and Sara who were working at the register. I told them that this was my first time here and i'm hungry! Melodie chuckled and then placed me in the extremely capable hands of her young assistant, Sara. Sara and I then proceeded to the back of the store to find the Cafe.  It was here that Sara gave me a thorough and patient overview of every single item on the menu that I had questions about.  I told her that I am trying to change my carnivore loving ways, but I still have these...well....needs.  She never snubbed me once for being 'meat-eater' and she then highly recommended to me the, \"Green Goddess Sandwich\".  Just reading the ingredients of this all vegetable sandwich made my stomach growl with anger.  No meat?! Are u for real with this? I thought to myself.  But, being the gentleman that I try to be, I just smiled and took her recommendation and she even let me add some 'vegetarian bacon' on top!  I also ordered the 12 Bean Chili and a side of non-dairy potato salad.   

Meanwhile, waiting for my order, Melodie then appeared to give me a mini tour of the fully fleshed art gallery located inside the cafe area to pass some time while the food was being readied. I found some of the artwork on the walls to be so inspiring that I began to visualise some of these pieces on my wall!  Shortly threafter, my meal arrives.  And, almost instantly I knew that I had clearly underestimated this place. 

That sandwich was sooo big and stuffed that it literally was falling apart when I picked it up!  The Green Goddess sandwich and the special sauce that accompanys this sandwich was magnificent.  And, coming from a guy who has eaten almost an entire cow in one sitting, this is really saying something.  

With that said, I absolutely, positively MUST give kudos to Sherry, the cook. 
The pita bread, the intricate layers of vegetables, the very texture of the sandwich itself was so good that my journey to the proverbial 'light-side', where alledgedly all the vegetarians, live and breathe was almost complete lol.  That was a mean, green sandwich!  And, yes with that, Rainbow End Natural Foods has earned yet another loyal and regular customer.  

I'm giving it a full 5 Stars for their ability to make meals that not only make a carnivore not miss 'meat!', but also managed to nearly 'convert' the same said carnivore with just the magic of one meal! 

See you there next week!"}
{"text":"I'll be the first to admit that I'm not in Rainbow's End's target audience: I'm not a crystal-rockin' hippie vegan, but I do love healthy food and they have it here. 

Shout out to the tea aisle: loose leaf varieties are available, as well as a novel iced-tea-travel-brewer bottle that I will probably go back to purchase. Bottom unscrews to add your tea leaves into the strainer, screw back on and fill with water, brew-drink-reuse. It doesn't get much easier than that.

The cosmetics and beauty product section has several tester bottles to try, which is a little unusual for a smaller place. Everything here appears to be carefully vetted before being featured, The Cream in particular is worth the raves (and the price, and the location behind the counter, as well as my first-born). Candles are also great here, particularly the fresh cotton scent.

But the deli counter in the back is what really drew me in: the GREEN GODDESS pita sandwich is $8 and packed with shredded carrots and beets, tomatoes, red onions, and sprouts, accented with veganaise and a side-packet of Goddess dressing. Heads up, that mad-delicious dressing packet packs a 200-calorie wallop. Rainbow smoothie with papaya is also a tasty option."}
{"text":"Just got a delivery thru grubhub. Food is fabulous! Can't wait to go to them to try more dishes"}
{"text":"For years I drove right by this place and never stepped foot inside until I started working at an office nearby and fell in love with their cafe, I was never really a big fan of vegetarian/vegan food until I came here, the food is awesome and so is the staff, absolutely love their southwest faux chicken salad! Plus when my son is sick, I like buying his medicine here as well, all natural is the way to go!"}
{"text":"An amazing cafe. I used to live nearby and this is one of the only places in Las vegas where you can get raw food, besides Go Raw which is on the other side of town. definitely a rare gem.

Everything on the menu is delicious- I've tried almost all of it, the wheatgrass is organic and fresshly juiced- potent  *exactly how it should be!

The selection of Herbs and Spices in the back is pretty much unmatched.

Not a large produce section- but you can count on what they do have is local and fresh.

Extracts, teas, vitamins, books, raw foods, desserts, clothes, toiletries, energy bars. ALL are hard to find anywhere else- albeit a bit pricier than whole foods or sunflower market, but then again you are supporting the independent business here! Support and spread the Love ;)

Speaking of- the staff here is phenomenal. They always remembered my name and what was going on in my life- even my boyfriend at the time! ** Once I forgot a Yves Saint Laurent Wallet here with $600 cash inside. I had no idea where it was for over 12 hours. They called me from a number i had left in my wallet letting me know I had forgotten it there! I went back the next day and not a cent was missing. Good Karma? I think YES.

Rainbows End is a GEM."}
{"text":"I will say they are a little pricey for what they offer. I bought some Justin's Hazelnut Butter there for $17 + tax... Online it is $14... And overall I feel like going to Whole Foods is probably a better option if you're on a budget.

But for the convenience, it is nice to have it right down the street for me. Whereas if I want to go to Whole Foods or any Farmer's market it is a longer drive.

The store is a bit dim and the cashier doesn't seem very happy. While I realize they're probably trying to be Eco-friendly - the dim lighting doesn't help with selling product. Nor do they have any special sales or discounts. Visual appeal as a business trying to sell products is important in my opinion.

They also have a cute cafe with a wide variety of vegan options I have yet to try. But am looking forward to trying. Something Whole Foods doesn't offer. 

If you're into a natural, holistic lifestyle - this place is worth checking out."}
{"text":"Rainbow's End has a wide variety of health food products with a cafe and the food is great. Check out Tuesday's special taco menu reasonably priced menu. The owner and employees are all pleasant. After eating, you can shop or just look around, go when you have a little extra time to relax."}
{"text":"For a city dedicated to rich and empty calories, this is a suprise on the menu.  A must know for health concious person residing in LV for any amount of time over a week or 2.  That said, it's just the basics."}
{"text":"I walked over a mile from my hotel to this place because of the reviews I read... I really wanted something healthy to eat. After asking questions about the menu and ingredients, I chose the  rainbows end salad.  It was Perfect... Just what I needed !! Fresh, Light, tasty, healthy, and fulling . The young lady who made it was very informative, she answered all my questions! It's also a cute store!! 
Min"}
{"text":"I dropped by on my lunch break on Sunday, which happens to be the day that their cafe is closed. From all the reviews, I had been looking forward to trying their green goddess sandwich but instead I settled for one of the premade meals. The options were a raw pasta with what looked like lots of olive oil and tomatoes or a raw pasta with cashew nut pesto. I got the second and it was pretty good, really cooling and refreshing for a hot Vegas afternoon. I was feeling pretty gnarly after a few celebratory days, so having a light, cleansing meal available was great. Not a daily lunch option at $7.99 for a small container, but I'll go back and try their cafe for sure. I picked up a few herbal supplements and I dig that they have a bulk herb section that's pretty large. I would consider looking into the different herb stores throughout china town, though, to get a fair idea of the market. Kombucha is often cheaper at Sunflower Market but they have a fair selection for a small store. Worth checking out for yourself if you're in the neighborhood and appreciate the crunchier aspects of life :}"}
{"text":"There is a miracle at the end of the rainbow! The last thing I'd ever imagined my husband becoming obsessed with is vegan chicken patties, but the Boca chicken sandwich at Rainbow's End converted him! I was prepared to take a bit of grief for selecting this health food spot for lunch after working out at the gym, but it ended up being the perfect choice. My BLT with veggie bacon was also great, and both sandwiches were served with a nice side salad. The cook took our order and served our food, and was very friendly to answer my husband's questions. Many compliments to the cook.

I love Rainbow's End because it looks like a hippie vitamin store straight out of the 1970s. They offer a large selection of vitamins and supplements as well as some food products, ingredients for vegan and gluten-free baking, and even fresh, local produce."}
{"text":"After class today, I decided to stop by and see what kinds of products this place carries. I am not a vegan or vegetarian but I do like to eat more of a plant based diet with some clean protein thrown into the mix. As far as the store goes, there are a lot of supplements for vegans/vegetarians/meat-eaters alike. There's a small selection of food products including refrigerated food products. I noticed they had ezekiel bread which I eat but it's definitely not as cheap as say Sunflower Market sells it for. Even though I had read reviews of the food, I came here thinking I was NOT going to order any food from their small cafe but once I saw someone walking away with their to-go order of the Green Goddess sandwich, I figured why the hell not?! Since I had also read that service was on the slow side, I placed my to-go order and walked around the store one more time. Less than ten minutes later, the nice waitress was calling my name with my food. Yay! I ended up leaving with a weird combo of my sandwich, nutritional yeast and a Raw Revolution bar...which by the way, they do not have a big selection of bars :( Oh well, shouldn't be eating those anyways.

The sandwich looked pretty good and was served with purple corn tortilla chips, a salsa and some other freaking amazing sauce that I have no idea what it was...but it was amazing!!!! The sandwich itself was amazing too. Sprouts, tomatoes, purple onions, veganaise, daiya?, shredded beets and carrots. Every bite was heaven. The plan was to eat half for lunch today and the other half for tomorrows lunch...um, yeah, it will probably be gone before then. It is served in the softest wheat pita pocket I've ever had...so good. Didn't care too much for the chips so I didn't eat more than a few. I can't wait to go back and try the other stuff on the menu including some of the desserts.

For any raw foodists, there are raw meals on the menu and even some already prepared raw \"pastas\" in the refrigerated section that looks pretty good. 

If this store had more selection in their grocery section then I'd probably give 5 stars BUT I will definitely be back to eat more of their deeeelish food!"}
{"text":"I ordered their ultra-famous Green Goddess sandwich which includes Avocado, Cucumber, Tomato, grated Carrots and Beets, Onions, eggless Vegenaise, and Cheese, topped with sprouts, inside locally-made whole wheat Pita bread.  It was delicious! Each bite had different layers of taste due to the amount of veggies in the sandwich.  

The 1st layer was fresh and light due to the cucumbers, cheese and sprouts. The 2nd layer was a little creamy because of the tomatoes, avocado and eggless vegenaise. The 3rd layer was the best, crunchy carrots and sweet taste of beets! 

It's a great restaurant with lots of healthy products to take home.  

I will be back to try other veggie delights!"}
{"text":"I love the vegan marinated chicken burger.  It has vegan mayo , fresh avacado, alfalfa sprouts , tomatoes.  $11.  Kind of pricey , worth it !!"}
{"text":"Ahh, the Follow Your Heart of Las Vegas. A good week before I left LA for my weekend Vegas getaway, I knew that I would be eating at least one of my meals at Rainbow's End. With few vegetarian and next to NO vegan options in this whole God-forsaken desert city, Rainbow's End is a legitimate Find, with a capital 'F.'

...But I'm not sure I believe in the cafe's 'A' health rating all that much. Even as I was ordering my food at the counter, my 6th sense-crazy-Krissy-dirty-restaurant alarm bells went off. But as I was desperate to have some legitimately vegetarian food, I hushed them in the same way I hush a toddler I babysit who loves to scream for her 'juicy' when it's three hours past her bedtime.

The food itself was pretty good -- I had the Green Goddess pita sandwich and J had the Awesome BLT. Was it as good as LA's Follow Your Heart? Not quite. Was it very similar to something I could make at home? Absolutely. But was I in the position to negotiate? Hell no! So I ate that sucker up and practically licked my plate clean. Luckily, our waiter was extremely warm and friendly, and so he didn't call me out on my Hoover vacuum cleaner impression.

All was well until - post meal - I decided to go to the bathroom. As soon as I walked in, the bells started ringing again, only this time I wasn't feeling crazed and ravenous with hunger, so I was more open to scoping out the place for dirty details. My eyes lit upon the trash can, with something dark and ugly taking up residence near the trash can's edge on the cracked linoleum floor.

No... It couldn't be...! But it was. A dead cockroach. Actually, it was a dead half-a-roach, because the only parts left were two upside down legs and half a shell. But I know my roach parts. And even more upsetting was that it looked like it had been a BIG MFer, and that its remnants had been there for a long time, overlooked and uncleaned. Ewwwwwww...

The optimist in me is still doling out 4 stars, because I want so badly for this place to survive and multiply -- Vegas needs veggie options desperately. Needless to say, if this place were in LA, I would NOT be giving out 4 stars, based on the bathroom bug.

I really hope someone from Rainbow's End reads this, because as much as I want them to thrive, I also want for them to be better restaurateurs and keep up on their cleaning and exterminating."}
{"text":"We found ourselves looking for vegan food option like the vegan nazis that we have become. I Called to find out if it was a restaurant or vitamin store given the yelp information. The phone call was pleasant. They are all of the above. The bacon and cheddar vegan pizza was bomb. This might be the first time I actually enjoyed vegan bacon. We also tried the watermelon and jalapeno salad. Although this salad confused the fuck out of my mouth, it was good. The place also had good vibes. Chalk board to draw on and book exchange?? YES PLEASE"}
{"text":"They overprice a lot of items they sell, you can very easily purchase for half the price on Amazon.com.   The stuff I do purchase from Rainbow I really need and use.  They have knowledgeable people that work there.  I respect that,  that's why I give them business regardless if the price is more than I can get elsewhere."}
{"text":"I love love love the portobello mushroom burger! The best vegetarian Sandwhich ever. 

As I was leaving I stepped outside of the door to leave, there was a rug covering super- un level bricks that meet your first step out of the door... I twisted my ankle and my knee... The woman behind the register saw the whole thing, she came out and rearranged the rug- as if it would magically make the bricks be level. 
However my knee is still not ok, ankle fine. 

So please be careful and aware of this precautionary hazard... I went back for another yummy lunch delight 3 days later and the rug was removed, making the un-even bricks visible, better than hidden, for sure."}
{"text":"This health foods store is small, but easily maneuverable through, and I doubt it ever gets crowded.  Off to the side is their cafe.  With so few all-vegetarian restaurants in this town, it's a hidden gem.  Serving food with organic ingredients, most items are already vegan, and if not, can be made so.  The cafe also features a few raw foods and specials, along with the requisite smoothie and juice menu.

With only one server, you're forced to wait patiently as you sit back and listen to the sitar music.  Once your food arrives, it's well worth the wait.  All the meatetarians raved about their food, the Green Goddess pita sandwich, BLT, Energy Plus with PB and banana slices...And I couldn't get enough of the avocado \"fries\" and the Taro Burger, one of the best veggie burgers I've ever had.  The smoothies were also tasty.

Portions and prices were just right for lunch; everyone left happy.  After all the oily, fried, heavy foods everyone tends to gorge on during a stay in Vegas, Rainbows End is a good stop for a cleansing meal."}
{"text":"What Rainbow's end lacks in stock, they make up for in service!

RE is a smallish health food and product (mostly product) store on Sahara, just east of the strip.  Nice for those in central (like me) who don't want to truck it all the way out to GV or summerlin to Whole Foods.  

In terms of the store, the food selection is pretty sparse;  there is a small refrigerated section of organic, raw dairy and juice items, flax seed oil, the usual.  The reason you'd go here though is for the teas, supplements, essential oils etc.   The staff are VERY helpful and knowledgeable...and have advised me on different items I've considered or bought.  Prices are fair considering the general lack of health stores in this part of town.

They do have a kitchen/restaurant area on the side, but I haven't tried it yet."}
{"text":"The power of plants and of Mother Nature is been underestimated. This place has everything organic and from the best source ever. 
The owner is very nice! 
I am impressed with this place! Very Reasonable prices that beats Whole Foods and other fancy places. 
Actually the variety of brands and options can't be found even at whole food. 
For every functional doctor or dietitian, this is your pharmacy."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've never been in this place before. They've been there since the 70's and the owner was extremely sweet and attentive. I wanted to try the cafe on a Saturday evening but it was closed as the cafe hours differ from the rest of the store. I wasn't disappointed though. I was able to find all sorts of vegan treats as well as a replacement cord and light bulb for my salt lamp that I though I wouldn't be able to use anymore after it broke a few weeks ago. I will definitely be coming back and exploring their selection of health food and trying out the cafe."}
{"text":"Great place for vegans/vegetarians. Surprisingly large menu. Super laid-back, hippie-style place. Been there since mid-70's, I think. I picked out a bottled juice from the fridge and asked them where I should pay for it. They told me to just bring them the bottle when I was done. Honor system? In Vegas? 

Good detox from all the crap food on the strip."}
{"text":"I discovered this gem of a place near my work and I am so happy! It has a wonderful deli which serves fresh and healthy sandwiches, salads, smoothies, and more. It is also a small store with anything from dog food, to hair dye, to cookies to supplements.. Anything your health conscious heart could desire. Prices were comparable to other health food stores that I have frequented. There are other dishes that I am eager to try so I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great place! I had the tuna sandwich with a side salad, and a hand made smoothie. I enjoyed it a lot and was so happy to find this store amid all the junkfood places in the area. It's not walkable from the strip but it is from sunshine hospital where I was at. The slogan on the reciept says, making Vegas greener for over 30 years! I hope that they stop using plastic utencils and wads of napkins, that would be really green!"}
{"text":"First off - My veggie panini from their restaurant was delicious . I absolutely loved it . 

Second - I wish the vibe here was better . The people that work here look miserable and don't give off a good vibe . Not something you'd expect from a small health foods market . :/ 

Third - Some items are very expensive (normal for a small shop with little buying power) ."}
{"text":"I came all the way down there to use a groupon and you refused to take it via my phone.  Shame on you for not honoring it.  GROUPON USERS BEWARE."}
{"text":"I really liked this store. My husband and I had some Veggie wraps that were pretty darn tasty! I love the fact they have a decent amount of Vegan options to choose from. The employees were nice and accommodating they have a large selection of essential oils which is pretty cool now I won't have to order online and wait. Will definitely be returning to see what else they have here!"}
{"text":"After reading Yelp reviews I couldn't wait to go to rainbow's End for the Green Goddess pita sandwich.  I was disappointed to find out that they had run out of key ingredients so I ordered something else.  The ingredients were minimal at best.  The soup of the day was watered down.  I was surprised to see that the store shelves were bare in places, merchandise was dated.  Having owned and operated health food stores in Hawaii I left with the impression that Rainbow's End would be going out of business soon.  This is an old part of town and other shops have left the immediate area.  Perhaps the likes of Sprouts and Whole Foods have added to the lack of foot traffic as well."}
{"text":"Pretty nice spot- was able to get my tart cherry juice for gout- not great from the outside but the staff was helpful and it had what I needed- which made it so much better than having to drive all the way across torn to Whole Foods."}
{"text":"I would like to start by saying I have shopped here quite a bit for the last year and I have had a good experience up until today.  Last week I purchased some Jason cocoa butter hand and body lotion along with some vegan chocolate peanut butter cups and some other vegan chocolate items.  When I got home I ate one of the pieces of vegan chocolate peanut butter cups that I purchased and it was not melted and was delicious.  The next day I popped out of the shower and went to put on my new lotion.  A little back story about this lotion is that I purchase it around every 3 weeks or so at a different store.  This is the first time I've ever purchased this lotion at rainbows end.  When I opened the lotion it was liquid and runny and pouring out of the bottle and not at all like the same consistency I am accustomed to with this exact same brand and scent of lotion.  I decided to put it on anyway and after a few minutes I realized I had to get back in the shower because it had gone rancid and it was no longer any good and the smell was just awful.  Next I called the store and told them about the lotion and asked if I would be allowed to exchange it for a new one from them.  The woman on the phone went on to give me a 20-minute lecture about how things go bad in the car even in five minutes and it's probably because I left it in a hot car.  Now remember I purchase chocolate with the same product and I opened the chocolate and nothing was melted. This same woman went on to tell me that even if I'm buying lotion I should bring  a cooler full of ice to the health food store  so it doesn't go bad.  So today a week after I purchased it, I went back to the store and the same woman who I spoke to on the phone told me they would not be returning my money or exchanging the product for a new one.  She advised me that I should call the company Jason to have it replaced or refunded.  What I am sharing with you is that I did not know about a no refund and no exchange policy when I purchased something from this company and I am warning anyone who does purchase something from here that this was the case for me.  The customer service here leaves something to be desired.  Not only was I blamed for the product not being good but I was completely denied any type of refund or exchange.  Unfortunately for them they lost a good customer today."}
{"text":"I tried the Green Goddess in a wrap, and it was delicious! I would definitely go back and order it again. The gentleman who helped me was awesome. He was very helpful and patient while I asked a thousand questions. He helped me make my decision. I don't know his name, but we was wearing some type of wrap on his head. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I love this place. They got the bomb bomb deli section wif samiches aaand shakes aaannd daily specials aaannd vegan desert aaanndd juices aaannndd soups. My favorite is the cheeseburger with \"chicken\" (fake chicken) and the Cuban rice n beans. I get lots of stuff here. Is a little pricey but I don't mind cause I support their convenient awesomeness. Plus the lady will special order stuff for you. Whaaaaa. Yea yea."}
{"text":"What a surprise! It's a little hard being a vegan visitor in Vegas and this place is a find.  I'm sick of going to buffets and paying a ton of money for salad and hummus. This is way better. Loved the raw vegan tacos!"}
{"text":"Was in town visiting and was looking for healthy places to eat.  They have great service and a menu with variety. 

This place is part health food grocery and part cafe.  They have free wifi if you want to work while eating.  The vibe here is pretty chill.

We had the veggie hummus platter, half grilled cheese sandwich/half salad, wheatgrass shots and green tea.  I liked the sandwich the best. The hummus was kind of chunky.

You pay at the register and show your invoice slip once you're done eating."}
{"text":"I've been eating health foods since I was a wee child in the 70s (I come from a poor family who could not afford health insurance) and I am impressed with this store's selection, in particular, thier bulk bin section. I also greatly enjoy thier prepared foods and most certainly do not skimp in the herbs and spices department.  Additionally, I am pleased that they sell non-toxic cosmetics.

the staff is friendly and Amanda provided helpful and informative customer service in regards to my query to purchase pleurisy.  She is a true professional."}
{"text":"Place is kind of hidden. The staff are all very friendly. I came in and got smiles and hellos from everyone. They have a huge variety of healthy stuff. Very similar to a whole foods but more brands. I found a vegan jerky that I've been searching for at this spot. They also have a nice cafe in the store where you can alter any item to become vegan."}
{"text":"Rainbow's end is my go to place to get some herb.. and by herb I mean different kinds of roots, teas, and various supplements.  They have a plethora of vitamins and natural products that you definitely can't find in most stores and a bunch of vegan/vegetarian foods to nom on either there or at home at your leisure.  The product here is a bit pricier than most places but I forego that due to the diverse amount of stuff that I can't find anywhere else.  Plus, the people here are nice and I usually get some type of free sample to take home and try out.  Very cool place and a must if you need some herbal attention and supplementation."}
{"text":"Number 1 choice for healthy, fresh food and Eco-conscious consumerism. Love the atmosphere and the people here. I'm proud to support this local gem."}
{"text":"Went for the Herb/Tea 101 Class by JC. It was very informative as he had a nice selection of herbs for us to smell it would have been nice to have a tea or 2 to sample but very educational. 

Also creates his own herbal blends for supplemental and provided us with a sample. Aside from education this place is a sleeper the kitchen is awesome they have great salads and sandwiches!

The store has an impressive variety of high quality health food products and ground up herbs/teas."}
{"text":"A great Vegetarian/Vegan/Raw food grocery store and cafe.
I just stopped in for a quick lunch and had the Green Goddess $7.49 on the recommendation of the cook. The sandwich is stuffed to the brim with avocado, cucumber, tomato, carrots, beets, onions, vegan mayo, cheese and stuffed into a very dark and supper soft whole wheat pita served with a side salad.
The sandwich is huge and i am a big man and i took half of it to go. The flavor of the sandwich was very fresh but needed the green goddess  dressing to be tossed with all the vegetables to really make it sing. the texture was great with the softness of the pita and the crispness of the fresh vegetables. 
As i was leaving i say some people come in for the smoothies and they looked really good and were alot bigger than i expected. i will have to stop in a try one sometime.
Overall and great lunch spot for takeout or a relaxing sit down lunch is the empty dining room."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for something different for lunch and snack. I have always wanted to go in here, so today on that side of town took the leap. I found a world of great food that is \"real\" food and that an individual can actually pronounce most of the ingredients on the packaging. 

The store has more than just health food , but I did see prior there used to be cooked food they served. I am unsure if they still prepare food, but they have plenty if bars and trial mixes for on the go. The cashier was a gentleman that was very helpful and courteous. The prices are a little high but you get real food."}
{"text":"The service at this place is super weird it was just dead quiet and no one seemed to be around not even any workers..., you order at the cafe by walking all the way to the back, the wait was a little long, but the food was delicious so it was worth it. The prices for the vegan products aren't too overpriced, I even got a vegan ice cream sandwich for less than two dollars! The selection of products is great, just overall got a real funny vibe from here."}
{"text":"I was extremely disappointed with my experience at the rainbow caf√©. After reading oodles of yelp reviews I decided to give it a go. It is walking distance from my hotel so I first checked it out but the cafe was closed so I looked around the store to see what they had. The staff was friendly to other customers but really short with me & my partner. I left fairly quickly & went on my day. I came back a couple days later to order from the cafe after reading all the amazing reviews. I was really looking forward to my meal. First off the staff was unbelievably rude, an older man was taking are order first & I was shocked at how he acted. Rolling his eyes, making snarky comments when we asked a question. You would think at a healthy food store/cafe they wouldn't have a problem answering your questions to make sure you don't eat something you're allergic too. So we tried to order a pizza but then the chef came out & told us she couldn't make the pizza without the cheese & we'd have to order something else. We went back to the drawing board and decided to try to put together a wrap we could eat with our dietary restrictions. Both of the staff was starting to seem annoyed that we wouldn't just shop anything in our bodies. We told the chef about all my allergies & that's why it was hard for us to order. She informed us of are options & we put together a \"faux\" chicken wrap with a dressing on the side. She told us if was a gluten free dressing, once we got are meal it was not in fact gluten free nor was everything on are wrap that we ordered. When my partner asked if they had hot sauce she looked at us like we asked her to drop kick a baby. The food it's self was nothing very special & made me sick later that day. The potato salad was good but that was the only thing. The atmosphere wasn't bad if they had nicer staff but I will NEVER be going back here. I am floored at how horribly I was treated."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place. Worth the 45 min walk I took from the strip! Competitively priced cafe that is nutrient dense food for your mind and body."}
{"text":"This review is mainly about their restaurant. It's been awhile since I was there so I don't even remember everything I ate there now, but I do remember their avocado fries. They are pieces of breaded avocado, and I liked them. I like Rainbows End as well. I'm a fan of natural products, and I am a vegetarian as well. I am giving them five stars."}
{"text":"If you're ever a vegan stuck in Vegas, this place is nearish the strip and has lovely veggie burgers and all sorts of other goodies for you."}
{"text":"Just have to say it is one of my favorite spots for supplements and vitamins.  They have everything you can think of - if they don't have it in stock they will order it for you.

Customer service is on point, you can't get from online store.  They are knowledgeable about the products and can stir you in the right direction.

Great place to connect with people who have interest in health...i believe they have weekly events."}
{"text":"I love this place and I just started to shop here again after about 10 years. I used to come here a lot for wheat grass shots when I danced in high school. This was the only place nearby that I could get wheat grass shots, it's crazy how times have changed.
When I walk in I love to see the nice blonde lady. Sorry I never got her name. She is so nice and she helps me every time. She knows so much about the products and whenever I ask a question she never seems annoyed and takes me right to products I need. 
They are priced reasonably and they have a caf√©! I love how they are not so big and have so many unique things."}
{"text":"So this is what Whole Foods, Trader's Joe, and Strouts use to look like in the olden days.  My friend wanted to meet there for lunch, so when I walked in, I was a tad confused about the concept, I was expecting a restaurant.  The 'cafe' is to the side the store and the kitchen is in the back.  I get that this is a 'cafe' inside of a natural food store so perhaps 'restaurant' personnel/ charm or temperament and skills are not necessarily available.  No problem!!

Not a vegan or vegetarian myself, I settled for the mushroom burger, which was freaking amazing.  We ordered from the back, per the instructions on the menu card on the table, and the food was delivered to us.  The portabella mushroom was cooked to perfection and the organic potato salad, one of the side choices, was pretty awesome as well.  I was expecting bland, tasteless food but I was pleasantly surprised. I would definitely go back for another try of something else.  

The 'cafe' was quaint and d√©cor was old town Vegas.  It's nice to get a glimpse of what Vegas was like back in the days, you see it with the patrons that walk in, the location, and the overall feel.  For the most part, staff was polite, nice and welcoming... just don't forget, you're not in a restaurant."}
{"text":"I am a green goddess!!!!  That is definitely true if I am what I eat!
After a long while since I missed out on Honey T.'s UYE ages ago and had this bookmarked ever since, I had this random hour between a meeting and going back to work.  I went to the ordering counter - and was told I must must must order the green goddess for my first go.

I decided to have it as it is and with the chips and fresh salsa.  I took it back to work and ate it there - fresh pita, onions, cucumbers, tomatoes, carrots, beets, avocado, vegan-aise and soy cheese I believe plus sprouts....some dressing on the side, and the blue corn chips and delicious salsa.

I am not a fan of condiments usually so next time I will just get the avocado-beet sandwich - I did not enjoy the vegan-aise.  However, the cheese was fine and all of the veggies were impeccably fresh.  I really can't go wrong with anything that has beets AND avocado AND tomato!  I always say my fave fruits are tomatoes and avocados.  I just love beets too, and it was so tasty.  The market itself was pretty bare so that was not too impressive.  I would probably come back for the avocado beet  sandwich next.  Lunch was $8."}
{"text":"Ordered lunch for my grandson and I all while the girl taking order was continually prodding me to order......
Extremely insensitive while I held a verbally hungry baby in my arms.......
It took too long for cold undercooked black beans and rice with one banana
We were starved and the baby wouldn't even eat it.  $11.90 bowl of beans and rice are still sitting on table so now I'm off to find descent healthy food for my grandson while we're here traveling from out of town."}
{"text":"They sell there shakes with non organic fruit eh feel like thats bit the crompromise for a health spot :'/"}
{"text":"VERY Knowledgeable staff and a good selection of top brands of supplements, and nutritional products.  I can't review the Cafe, as I have not personally eaten there.  I think they are one of the best nutrition stores in the Las Vegas region.  I have worked in the health field for 23 years and I am a Certified Nutrition Specialist, so I can say with some confidence that they are stocking some top quality items I haven't seen in any other store here in town.  All supplements are Not the same, and over the counter supplements are often of very low quality compared to the ones only available only through licensed health professionals.  They have many products that are pharmaceutical grade and comparable to some of the products only available from your licensed health professionals."}
{"text":"I WAS going to give this place a 4 star review...until an unfortunate incident recently.  

I shop at this store from time to time - they have a small selection of natural/organic snack foods and I love that they have a little deli as well (which I haven't had the chance to try).  Trader Joe's and Sprouts have a better selection, but this place is close to my place and I like to support local business.

I'm perusing the aisles after the gym one afternoon, texting on my phone, and generally, minding my own business.  I picked up just 2 or 3 things - some kale, some sort of delicious gluten-free snack, etc - and I headed to the check out line.  As I'm checking out, an older employee says to me:

Old, rude man: \"Did you put something in your purse?\"  
Me: *Looks around, confused* \"Umm, I'm sorry, what?\"
Old, rude man: \"I think I saw you put something from the shelf into your purse.\"  
Me: *Kind of laughs, offended, but more awkward* No.  Definitely not.
Old, rude man with no social skills: \"Can I take a look?\"
Me: *in disbelief* \"Yeah - go right ahead.\"  *opens purse, shuffles through it for him to see*
Old, rude man:  \"Oh.  Ok.\"

End scene.

Look, I get that you're protecting your store - so, if you think you saw me steal something, kudos to you for asking.  However, when you realize that I did NOT, in fact, steal anything, and that you just accused a paying customer or shoplifting, that would be the appropriate time to apologize to said customer...but as I stood there waiting, mouth agape, I realized there would be no apology forthcoming.

Now, I wasn't embarrassed, because well, I'm me....but most people would be mortified.  The fact that he didn't apologize or even acknowledge that he mistakenly accused me of theft is extremely off-putting.  The checker girl didn't say anything either.  It was all a bit odd.  It was so odd in fact, that when I got to my car, I double checked my purse just to make sure nothing had accidentally fallen in!!  (Nothing had.)

Sad about this review - I really liked that store."}
{"text":"Since I tend to me more of a bargain shopper, I get most of my groceries at Wal-Mart or Smart & Final. Typically I don't really seek out or buy health type foods. But recently I heard that consuming locally produced honey can help reduce allergy symptoms but where to find local honey?!? Turns out this place carries it along with pretty much anything else that the health consumer could desire. I won't get specific since I just don't have much knowledge in this genre but what I can say is that the staff is friendly, the store is clean and well stocked and it even smells really good!...sort of an herb/incense type of aroma. Although, I might not end up doing a ton of shopping here, I'll definitely come back if my honey experiment works and probably also bring my mother and other health conscious friends when they visit. The only reason I gave it a 4 is because it's a bit pricy but from what I know, the prices here seem just about right for these health niche types of products. Oh and there's also a small cafe to the side which is a cool add on that I wouldn't have expected! I now update my rating to 4.4!"}
{"text":"I order take out from the Rainbows End Cafe at least once a week. It's nice to have a healthy vegetarian/vegan alternative. Here's what i recommend : 

The cucumber hummus boats (not sure that's actually what it's called, but it's a generous appetizer, really clean and yummy)

The Hummus Veggie plate (best beets I've ever tasted)

The Fry burger with Spinach Feta and Sun Dried tomato (simply amazing!)

The Greek Salad (very fresh and a good portion)

Aside from the cafe I've bought a few of their natural products too. The staff is really courteous and nice."}
{"text":"I've worked across the street from this place for the past 2 and a half years and finally today I decided to go in and give it a try. I ordered the green goddess sammy, it had a TON of sprouts (I'm a fan)  and it is probably one of the best things I've ever put in my mouth. The staff was welcoming and friendly, I will be back."}
{"text":"Rainbow's End is both a health food store and cafe.  The store has lots of supplements, bulk tea and spices, and lots of veg'n/raw food products.  It's quite pricey, even compared to Whole Foods a lot of times, but I really like to support local businesses (and I can walk there!), so I'm happy to spend a wee bit extra.

I've had some really great stuff from the cafe - particularly the Raw Tacos-red cabbage \"shells\" filled w/ walnut \"meat\", veggies, avocado and cashew creme, and the Goddess Sandwich - a pita stuffed to the brim with shredded carrot, beets, spinach, etc w/ a tahini based dressing.  Yum!

The cafe has a selection of vegan desserts on hand, vegan and also gluten-free chocolate chip cookies, and they are now also selling raw meals packaged to-go in the refrigerator case!"}
{"text":"I'm only part-time vegetarian, but I like that this place exists.  Especially if my vegan friends want to go out.  I didn't care for the avocado fries (tasted like peanut butter, yuck) but the grilled cheese sandwich made with tomato and avocado on sprouted bread was pretty tasty, albeit kinda small.  My friend's raw vegan tacos weren't as good as what she makes at home, but the avocado veggie burger was a hit with her boyfriend.  One complaint is that blue corn chips come with the sandwich, or you can pay an extra 50 or 75 cents for kettle potato chips?  Kind of a rip-off; don't they both come in big bags and we get a tiny pinch on our plates?  The sodas are cheap, and the cafe seating is comfortable.   I hear you can rent that space for $25, which is not bad for a central venue."}
{"text":"They have a great selection of health foods on the shelves. They also have a kitchen which has very clean foods for breakfast and lunch. I really love the Green Goddess sandwich with a mock chicken patty added. Great green drinks made fresh. If you're in town looking for a clean vegan or vegetarian place to grab a bite, check it out."}
{"text":"Went with a friend and we ordered the avocado \"fries\", green goddess, and tacos. It was Taco Tuesday.  Everything was fresh and tasty.   

Happy to support a local place offering healthy options.  The Avocado \"Fries\" are simply avocado slices dipped in nutritional yeast & flax seed and were just ok.  The Green Goddess and Tacos were great.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. Yes it's a bit over priced but they are personable and have a phenomenal restaurants. Get the green goddess sandwich!"}
{"text":"What do you hope to find at the end of a rainbow? If a pot of vegan beans is your answer, then you should head to Rainbow's End! It is one of the few establishments in town dedicated to vegetarian/vegan cuisine. In addition to the caf√©, it is also a market stocked with healthy stuff. 

I didn't peruse the aisles, but I did eat lunch. I went with black beans and brown rice, which came with a side salad. There were no bells and whistles here... no peppers or onions or any distinctive spices. It was very straightforward, healthy tasting grub. But, I think that healthy can still have flair, so I was a little disappointed. Through some color in those beans!

In the future, I may take a vegan friend here for a bite, but for now, I won't be running back for beans. I recommend ordering something different!"}
{"text":"Speaking of the Cafe specifically:

-Over priced items
-Extra sauce you pay for is smaller than expected
-Not all items are available

So disappointed."}
{"text":"Such a gem!
I stumbled upon this place while visiting Vegas and loved the atmosphere & great selection :) A wonderful experience, I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"As I've yet to try the caf√©, their menu looks amazing. I love their loose herb section. You can find things there that may not be available otherwise. Nice, friendly atmosphere. Whether you're a Vegan, vegetarian, or just trying to eat a little healthier. Rainbows End is a great place to stop in at."}
{"text":"Thank god for the Rainbow's End Cafe. Vegas needs all the vegan and healthier options it can get. 

The Green Goddess sandwich is where it's at. Plus the people are so awesome!!

I don't get them often because it's soy but I love the tofu croquettes and gravy with extra gravy!"}
{"text":"Helpful, knowledgeable staff.  Owners conscience of carrying a variety of supplements and food products that are healthy and and quality driven. Great little store. The restaurant is closed for now but the store is worth a stop. Clean and well stocked."}
{"text":"Delicious, nice vegetarian and vegan selection, smoothies too!  Highly recommend the Chick burger.  Good selection of natural products and groceries."}
{"text":"I enjoy going here for lunch since it gives me a sense of eating healthy when you cant prepare your own food at home. The Portobello Burger is great, and is really flavorful, whole the tofu tomato soup is amazing as well even on a hot Vegas day. It can tend to be a little pricey ($10-$20) per person, but the quality oversees the cost. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"The people that work here are insanely friendly.

We stopped in for a couple sandwiches- food was REALLY good, but expect a bit of a wait for preparation. Definitely worth waiting though. We got a bowl of chili and a \"BLT\" which was so yummy that my stomach is now growling just remembering it....

While waiting for our food I was chatting it up with one of the workers. I had shared with her that I had a headache for the past couple days that I couldn't get rid of (and since I'm pregnant, not many options to get rid of it.) She actually gave me this little bottle of peppermint oil which helped tremendously. Very sweet. 

Cute little cafe in a hippy grocery store in a part of town where you wouldn't expect to find a hippy store."}
{"text":"Restaurant here has really improved its menu.  Added raw foods selections, Latin vegan from Chef Mayra and new vegetarian specials.   Fresh juices, the green goddess pita and meatless burgers are still there w/gr8 salads and an improved dining area.  Service is sometimes slow but you can call your order in advance."}
{"text":"this place is been here long before many health food stores  but for some reason some prices are out of control .. why buy anything here when you can get them cheaper somewhere else .. 
1) the rent can't be that much since they been here 4ever( they might even own the building)
enough said ^_^
Just because it's locally owned don't mean the products are local with less impact not he environment  blah blah :)"}
{"text":"Amazing little cafe in the corner of the store. It's truly yummy and healthy! Try it for yourself!"}
{"text":"While I didn't venture into the cafe portion of the store, there are nearly three aisles dedicated to supplements & natural healing remedies. I did a lot of comparison with pricing (Rainbows End vs. Whole Foods), & there are actually some deals to be had here depending on what you need. I found that most of what I buy at Whole Foods can be purchased here for about $2-3 cheaper than what's at Whole Foods (then again it really depends what you're looking for). They carry a good amount of herbal tea products, powders, mixtures, green powders, even refrigerated sprouted breads. There is no fresh produce as some people might want to assume, but this place makes up for a lot of the packaged natural foods.

A lot of interesting & good natural remedies & products that Whole Foods doesn't even carry in their stores, so this place is a definite check out if you're into the holistic natural scene of things. My next review once I get back here will be on what they got at the cafe, so I'm eager to see what else I can find in this place. This is definitely a win for those into natural foods; you'll have tons of fun browsing through this place. They also offer a little section on aromatherapy oils, and also a little book shelf for natural food processing & education."}
{"text":"Very very helpful here. While they don't have a super large selection they're willing to help and get items I'd there available.

There's also a cafe of sorts here though never ordered."}
{"text":"Support local joints!

Yes, Vegas has Whole Foods and Trader Joes and Sprouts Markets, but why go to them when you have fantastic farmer's markets with local and CA grown organic and sustainable produce (every day of the week except mondays right now) ... AND you have Rainbow's End for everything else. Supplements, bulk goods and mores...

They also have a nice in-house restaurant that makes fresh juices! I am a regular for their non-sweet green juice with a splash of lemon.

They also have a large eating area where they often have classes and meetups. Their meetup is here: http://www.meetup.com/wholeway"}
