{"text":"mmmmmmmm, as close to NY pizza as I have found. excellent toppings, great pricing."}
{"text":"Can't believe I waited this long to try Z! This brand new location within the new strip that houses all recently opened Paradise, Qdoba, Subway, Daphnes Greek, etc. in Chandler is wonderful! They're main pull is that they use organic and additive-free ingredients (also skim cheeses) and are positioned as a \"healthier\" and fresh pizza. 

It wasn't happenin when we went, but judging by the steady flow of people coming in to grab takeout, the word seems to be spreading about Z (they close at 9p). I noticed the staff was overly attentive with baking the perfect pie (they bake it in front of you) and making sure timings were just right and even showed a customer in line their pizza, askin if it looked fine.

We got the Casablanca, a mix of Ricotta, mushrooms, TONS of garlic, and artichoke hearts. Delish. They def. did not skimp on the ingredients. A 10\" is great for 2 people, as it is sliced into 4 (the specialty pizzas will run ya about $10 for the small size). We also tried the caesar salad and although we enjoyed it, it wasn't all that. I think the dressing was lacking.

There is a rack of pre-made slices for people on the go (I hear these are surprisingly fresh), but I would suggest waiting in order to get a freshly baked one. Z also has a selection of sandwiches and calzones, but I didn't get a peek at em.

Majorly recommend in terms of fast-ish pizza. Very clean interior. Friendly staff...I see zpizza fastly getting even more popular in the Chandler area."}
{"text":"The pear and gorgonzola pizza is probably the best pizza I have had in a long time. There are a lot of complaints here about the service, but we didn't seem to have any problems when we ate here. It is pretty small, not a place I would really recommend for dine-in. They also sell by the slice, which is something you don't see everyday. I look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"I wish I could be wittier here, but I have no idea what sort of flaccid, cardboard-flavored, awful, disgusting stuff the reviewers who like this place were eating before they thought that this was good \"pizza.\"  I've tried it several times, hoping for improvement, only to be disappointed.  Oh, Z Pizza, how you never fail to fill me with regrets...

The first time was from a neighborhood circular just a little while after they'd opened a few years ago.  We ordered the Casablanca, and were told to come in 20 minutes to pick it up.  We ran a little late and showed up 5 minutes past the due date.  They hadn't even made our pizza.  The guy behind the counter grabbed a pre-made crust, tossed the toppings on (I swear he must have poured a gallon of garlic sauce on it or something; Papa John's and the new Domino's had nothing on this pie) and handed it to us with a look of disdain.  Eating it was even worse.  Crust was alternately soggy, half-cooked. and stale, ricotta tasted past its due date, and we ended up throwing most of it out and having PB&J sandwiches instead.

The second time was at a friend's place.  His girlfriend was a fan, and it had been a couple of years, so I thought that maybe they'd gotten over the New Restaurant Hump and improved.  This time it was Pepperoni.  Pizza arrived late and was cold, the driver wasn't at all apologetic, and once again, it tasted awful, despite the beers we pounded back to dull the senses and lower our standards. 

The third time was when someone ordered it for my office.  \"Oh, there's traditional cheese here,\" I thought.  \"It can't be that bad.\"  Apparently, I had learned nothing from my previous experiences.  I've had a lot of lousy pizza in my time, but this was the absolute WORST.  At least a half-dozen of us from the office got food poisoning at the same time, and the only thing we'd all eaten was the \"pizza\" from Z Pizza (not even the same pies, either!).

If you want ACTUAL good pizza, go to NYPD.  Or Grimaldi's.  Or hell, buy Totino's.  Anything is better than the slop they have there."}
{"text":"I've loved zpizza for a while now, but I just tried their provence and tuscan pizzas and they are amazing!"}
{"text":"Three words.. love love love! First off, the cute little delivery boy randomly asked me if I had any wire hangers. Images of Joan Crawford swam through my head. Next, the prices are phenomenal. I couldn't even use the coupon I had because the entire meal was under $20. My friend devoured his pasta in less than 5 minutes and I shortly followed suit with my delicious cheese pizza. 

Normally, I am a strict pizza purist...just cheese with nothing else. However, judging by the quality of the foundation, I may be willing to branch out and see what other wonderful flavors are in store.

I'll also keep a wire hanger handy just in case."}
{"text":"I go hear often enough that employees recognize me and know what I'll order.  Great place to stop in and have a quick slice of pizza.   They also have my favorite soda there, Jones soda.  Good sized menu with organic pizza, salad and noodles.  Has 5 or 6 four person tables and 2 two person tables on the inside as well as stool seating along the wall.  Some more tables are just outside.  You can see the employees making everything through a glass window.  

The pizza is really good, which is all I ever have there.  I'll usually go out and eat there, but when I'm tired or just lazy, they deliver!!"}
{"text":"I live not but a half mile from this Z Pizza and I can't in good conscience bring myself to ever call Pizza Hut or Dominoes again!  The pizza selection fantastic...You've got to get the Napoli or the Provence pizzas.  They're not just good, but sublimely good for a place around the corner.  I feel bad for anyone not within delivery range, but I guess I am lucky to be so close and have access to great, simple pizzas and salads that don't taste \"fast\".  A definite must visit when in the Northeast Valley!"}
{"text":"Visitors from out of state, my husband and I came across this little pizza place while walking downtown.  We were more than pleased.  The pizza was EXCELLENT! we ate an entire large pizza and were very satisfied but not overly full.  The staff was friendly and the place was very clean, including the bathrooms.  You can't go wrong eating here."}
{"text":"I hardly ever eat pizza because I can never find a place that the slice is not sliding around the plate in it's own oil/grease.  BUT this place is soo wonderful.  It's more gourmet pizza with tons of organic ingredients.  So for the health nuts (it's cool I'm a member too!) this is whole, fresh ingredients packed into a beautiful presentation.  The pizza and salads are so pretty you almost don't even want to eat them! But then the salivating begins and you dive in.  

My personal favorites are the Casablanca (mozzarella, ricotta, mushrooms & artichoke hearts) and the Moroccan (pesto, eggplant, feta cheese & eggplant!).  The salads are also great.  I've had the Pear & Gorgonzola Salad (to die for!) and the ZBQ Salad.

I live less than two miles away and even on a weekend between 6 - 8 pm they still deliver within 30 minutes if not earlier!

Try it!!! zzzzzzzzz :)"}
{"text":"Sadly, this is the best available delivery pizza in our area.  It is California-style, which means good, fresh ingredients in interesting combinations for a bit too much money.  Sometimes it is not as satisfying as a more traditional pizza.  Also, they can be incosistent.  Probably one in three deliveries ends up being sub-par (undercooked, too little cheese, etc.)"}
{"text":"Mixed feelings about this location.  The food is always great, but the service is lacking.  MOSTLY on the managerial level.  We've been ordering from this location since it opened and I think we finally had it!  Last week I ordered a pear and gorgonzola salad and a couple of other things.  Well, first I got a call from the manager, telling me that they were on their way, but that they didn't have lays chips. I agreed to a substitute. Even though she said they were on their way, they still took 35 minutes to arrive(we are only 5 blocks away!!)! And of course something was wrong on my order. The pear and gorgonzola salad was sans pear!  When I called, a man simply and politely told me I would get a replacement salad on my next order. I agreed. So I ordered today by phone even though I tend to order online (keeps my order simple and minus the human error). Well everything went smoothly until I brought up the salad. The guy taking the order did not put me on hold and only covered the phone, so I heard everything they were shouting back and forth. The manager said I was lying and that she wasn't giving me anything for free.  She then came on the phone, completely aggravated and told me she could add a topping to my pizza!  Excuse me? When I told her that I'd like what they initially promised me, she said that people often scam them and lie and use double coupons...etc, so it was weird they didn't take care of it at the moment it happened! So she denied it and when I began getting aggravated she screamed and said...\"YOU WON'T EVEN LET ME TALK!\". I listened to her call me a liar and she wanted me to be cool. I told her we had been their loyal customers for a long time and I've never even used a coupon or gotten anything for free!  In fact I've never even called to complain about all the other mistakes they've made in the past. She finally agreed to my demand only after asking to cancel my order and saying I would never eat there again. Why did it have to reach that point? I could only say that it is part ignorance and lack of professionalism. Of course, the salad arrived with three very thin slices of pear, not to mention the fear of eating the food that cost us over $25.00! They just lost a great customer and by the looks of it, they are losing many more. P.S. If anyone has their corporate number please send it to me."}
{"text":"I volunteered myself to help the new boss from Dallas move his mattresses from storage to his new home by buying a truck 4 years ago. FNG.

I had put in a few hours at work, and started to get that grumpiness that can only mean that it is time for a bite. You see without food the grumpiness evolves into rash hostility and I decided it was far too soon to pummel my new boss with his own queen sized pillow top mattress.

I decided to finally try Z-Pizza as it is right down the street. I ordered a slice, a salad and a soda, while chuckling at the aliteration.

The girl working the counter had that first job perkiness to her which was enjoyable. She really seemed to hope that I enjoyed my first trip.

The pizza was tasty, thin crust healthyish style. I was a little sad that I had to wait for my salad while I had my pizza, because I planned to eat the salad first making sure the last taste I left with was delicious pizza, but as it turned out the pear and garganzola salad was the highlight of the meal. The walnuts were not over candied, the pears were fresh and ripe, it was perfect for taking away the grumps.

I did not throw mattresses."}
{"text":"Went last night, as I was having a salad craving and *THIS LOCATION HAS CLOSED. What a bummer! I still recommend Z as a whole, so check out another location!"}
{"text":"I wish i could give zpizza a five star because the pizza is awesome...i go there usually twice a week because i work right around the corner...i just hate the service, there always so rude and if you get a pizza delivered it takes like 2 hours to get to the office...usually cold but it even cold the pizzas good...i hate the service but what can you do if you want good pizza"}
{"text":"It's hard not to write a good review of a place when you order one pizza and end up with two.  Both being about twenty times the size you thought that they would be.  Wow, that two for one special they have really rocks.

The pizza itself is definitely of higher quality than a lot of other places I've been around herein the Valley.  The cheese melted properly so that it doesn't slide off the second you bite into it.  The toppings all taste fresh, not like they were sitting in a cooler for the past week.  The pepperoni is a bit greasy but, if you're ordering pepperoni, you're not allowed to complain about that.

Give it a try.  It's good quality and you don't feel like you're harming your body by eating it."}
{"text":"There is a Z Pizza very close to my house that I love to get pizza from...  I was doubly excited when I found out that there was one opening near my work.  So I finally got a chance to try this one out and it was just as good as the one near my house.  My only complaint would be that they did not really have anything to choose from for individual slices and it would take 15 - 20 minutes for anything else.  It was only 12pm so one would think that they would have planned accordingly for a lunch rush.  Anyway I ended up with 2 slices... one cheese, one veggie and a drink for $6.50."}
{"text":"If there is one word I can use to describe this place, it would be:

Meh

Variety of pizza wasn't bad, but good god how can they charge so much for salad?!  I think once in a blue moon is good enough for this place."}
{"text":"Being health conscious, I really wanted to love this place.  Options for whole wheat crust, low fat cheese, and plenty of organic ingredients sounded delicious.  We went on a Friday evening, at 5pm ish, and were the only people there.  Maybe they do lots of delivery?  I hope so.

The manager was very friendly and helpful, and encouraged us to do a half and half 18 in. to try two different kinds.  I tried the Napoli, similar to a Margharita but with a garlic sauce instead of a red sauce.  The garlic sauce was.....different.  Actually, I was burping garlic all night and had a bit of a stomach ache.   The crust was flat and kind of blah too, maybe it was the whole wheat crust?  The boyfriend did like the pepperoni half of his though.  What was nice was that I was stuffed after 1 1/2 pieces, and for me, that's a miracle!  This girl can eat some pizza!  I credit the whole wheat.

We also shared the Greek salad, which was delicious!  

I'd give them another chance, if only for the healthy choices."}
{"text":"I love Z Pizza so much it is almost always our Tuesday night meal plan (because of the buy one pizza get the 2nd for 5$. used to be free but still a great value,). My favorites are the Mexican, the Zbq with the thai being a close third. I have ordered from this location and the one on Hayden and they are both good but this one edges the Hayden one out I think. I want to branch out and try more but I'm so hooked it makes it really tough to change! 
We always order 2 mediums and have them for dinner and lunch the following day! So yummy!"}
{"text":"Closed - they did not renew their lease :( Saw a sign posted up on their door this morning."}
{"text":"I suppose with this type of restaurant, the time of day you arrive dictates how good your meal is.  We showed up about 2pm on a Sunday and the Pizza slices had obviously been under the lights for some time.  Dry and overcooked, the pizza was very forgettable.  I suppose next time I go I'll request a fresh pizza."}
{"text":"The pizza is my favorite in Phoenix.  It is light, airy and tasty and does not give you that \"I am reading to explode as my cotton mouth is making me drink two liters of water every half hour\" feeling.

The ingredients are fresh and delicious.  

I am hooked!"}
{"text":"Ooh Z Pizza, I really really want to love you but you forgot one of the most important features of my dinner!

Last Friday my boyfriend and I had a date night which included ordering in and watching the Olympics!  We ordered a pepperoni pizza for him and a California salad with chicken for myself.  I loved that we could order on line and choose our pick up time.  When I got to Z Pizza they promptly took our pizza out of what appeared to be a warming oven and then took my salad out of the fridge.  I really hope they hadn't been warming since I sent the order over an hour before.  

I got home and was VERY disappointed that they forgot to add the grilled Chicken to my salad.  I think it was something like a $4 up charge to add the grilled chicken and there was definitely NO chicken on my salad.  BOO!

As for the pizza, my boyfriend enjoyed and commented that it definitely had its own unique flavor.  

I anticipate that we may return but I guess I will have to check my salad before I drive home..."}
{"text":"We tried the plain jane pep pie the other day. It was good but the speciality pizzas are the way to go. I sampled a slice with mushrooms and caramelized onion and OMG that was really good. 

The service is still top notch and the Tuesday specials are great."}
{"text":"Was it worth the 21$ for a salad and small pizza? Absolutely not! Bad service. Maybe the guys grandma died I don't know. I want to tell you what really made me mad about the experience. We order the small pizza and salad and the guys could have cared less and took our $ and we sat down. We were looking around and hmm, there's a sign saying \"x large pizza and large salad only 23$\". Wow that would have been nice if the guy told us that. I left hungry, mad and unsatisfied. 

To the owner: teach your employees the value of upselling and telling the specials. Something so small can affect a customers experience negatively. 

And your salads are severely overpriced 

Won't go back unless I'm desperate."}
{"text":"excellent pizza! helpful, kind service! quick take out! i had the thai and it was everything i hoped it would be and more. crust crispy, ingredients fresh, toppings plentiful, sauce peanut-y. i am so happy i work less than a mile from here - i'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"OMG OMG OMG Hands down the best (and best for you) pizza around. Try the Pear and Gorgonzola, or the nitrite-free pepperoni, or any of the Rusticas. Seriously...they might have a secret ingredient because I find myself craving their pizzas in a way I've never craved any other pizza. Not only that, but they are the nicest group of folks you could ever hope to meet! (Yes, they deliver in the neighborhood -- and check out 2 for 1 Tuesdays!!!!)"}
{"text":"Six months have elapsed and I have to say that I'm glad to say things have gotten far better at this location. We've ordered weekly for the past month and the Items are ready  when they say they will be, the ingredients are still top notch and more importantly present on the pizza:) 

 2 x Tuesday deal is a steal but you are going to wait way longer than it would take you to drive down from anywhere in the delivery area:)  

This , once again, looks like the start of a tasty relationship. :)"}
{"text":"Its just Ok. Very slow service. Pizza was not bad but nothing spectacular. I do not know what else to say. I was hungry, i ate some of their pizza, it was not too bad, i became unhungry. End of story."}
{"text":"Holy smokes, this place rocks!  I am vegan, and as soon as I heard that Z Pizza offers the new Daiya vegan cheese, I rushed right over.  I chose the \"create your own\" option and got a pizza with extra vegan cheese, avocado, and serrano peppers.  All I can say is wow!  The vegan cheese was melted to perfection, the crust was heavenly, and there were just the right amount of toppings.  Even my husband, a non-vegan, liked it.

The next week, I went back and got another vegan pizza.  I also picked up a Tuscan Mushroom (with real mozzarella) for my husband.  He could not stop saying \"Damn, this is good.\"  

Z Pizza has all the standard pizzas (pepperoni, sausage and mushroom, etc.), but they also have some really unusual pizzas (Thai, Santa Fe, Greek).  Also, their mozzarella cheese is made from hormone free, part-skim, Wisconsin milk.  The prices are a little higher than pizzas you can get with a coupon at Pizza Hut, Papa John's, etc., but the quality makes up for it."}
{"text":"So after my latest frustrations with ZPizza I contacted management. I explained the situation and after an initial email I received a follow up. They didn't give me free pizza for life(guaranteed five stars) but they did give me a small discount on my next pizza which we ordered that night to see if things would change.

I was told by management that they had new cooks and the online ordering I guess is not as straight forward on their end as it is for the customer so we called in our order last night. 

I am happy to report the pizza was pretty much perfect, not missing any toppings, a decent amount of toppings, etc. I am not sure the price was right but maybe their prices have gone up, even so I appreciated that management actually got back to me and that I can enjoy Z again."}
{"text":"Oh so good. Wicked good. 

I ordered a GFCF (gluten-free, casein-free) pizza that was fanTAStic. I make a pretty good GFCF pizza, but Z's made me weak in the knees. No cardboard crusts, no imitation cheese flavor - this was genuine pizza for the digestively-challenged. Celiacs rejoice! 

Add to this that the waitstaff were friendly and prompt with our food, and we had a five-star experience all around. The only downside, of course, was the price. There are no prices on the menu on Z's website, and it was thanks to a Groupon that I was up for going to a restaurant that doesn't publicize their prices. 

And here's why: The GF pizza only comes in the smallest size (a 10\" personal pan pizza), and it is roughly the size of one slice of a \"regular\" pizza. Yet for this wee one with two toppings, it came to $16! 

They do have a special on Tuesdays, which is buy one pizza, get the second for $5, so that makes it more reasonable. I'll just have to schedule my pizza cravings for Tuesdays, because this one has certainly created a food memory in the mouth, oh yes."}
{"text":"love the vegan options. try it, the daiya cheese they use is just as good if not better than the real thing. service can be a little slow, but always polite and welcoming."}
{"text":"We ended up here for our book club.  Not too shaby.  We were going to be at the greek place across the street but they ended up being closed on Sundays.  Friendly service, yummy pizza and good tossed salad because of their house dressing.  Overall, nice little pizza place."}
{"text":"I wish I could be wittier, but this was some pretty good vegan pizza.

Finding pizza with \"cheese\" when you are eating vegan can be difficult. Finding food options, period, can be difficult. So my vegan friend was searching out places to eat (besides the usual), and his friends suggested this place. And you know what, the berkeley vegan was pretty delicious.

I used to be distrusting of fake cheese and meat, but I have been able to put aside that fear to realize that its not so bad. In fact, the cheese they use here (daiya, I think) is remarkably similar to the real thing; and the burger crumbles were flavored a lot like italian sausage.  For $20 for a large, its not terrible, but its far from cheaply priced.  The crust was okay, it was not as chewy as I prefer, but not like cardboard either.  If you are vegan looking for pizza, this is a good choice."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Fair prices. Can get pretty busy around lunch. Nice place with outside seating too. Two slices and a drink will run you about $6."}
{"text":"Z Pizza has great lunch specials.  I love their slice, salad and a drink deal you can get for about $7.  Very convienent for a quick workday lunch.  

It's a hard decision whether to eat at Slices or Z Pizza.  I really like the food at both, but Z wins an extra star for always being well maintained (and cool) inside."}
{"text":"I just moved here from New York and feel that this pizza is amazing.  Beautiful, crisp crusts....."}
{"text":"I drive 25 minutes to this location when I want pizza for lunch. The pizza is incredible. Like many others after having discovered this pizza, I cannot bring myself to ever ordering a Domino's, Pizza Hut, Papa Johns, etc... pizza again! 

I guess Z Pizzas deal is organic ingredients. It works. I think its the sauce that sells it to me. It's pretty much just tomatoes. They have other things like sandwiches and salads, but I never make it past the 2 slice combo for lunch."}
{"text":"Z Pizza is great! I used to go here for lunch all the time with my co-workers (we went through a phase when we were going there at least once a week). They have a great variety of pizza and almost every slice I've tried has been very good. The guys who work at the Tatum location are awesome - super friendly and great service!"}
{"text":"I have been to Z pizza a few times and always had a good experience. Their pizza is on the healthier side in comparison to other pizza's. They have so many toppings to choose from to please anyones taste buds.

 Randomly they also have a great tuna sandwich. My beau had a meatball sandwich which I would highly recommend. The french roll was soft and the meatballs stayed in the sandwich, that is always good. 

If you go to the one on Thomas go next door to the pink spot and grab an ice cream sandwich, delish!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've tasted in Arizona - hands down and I'm from Jersey. We know good pizza!

It's healthy, has organic ingredients, and the staff at this location is friendly and efficient.

Can't beat the buy one, get one pizza deal on Tuesdays, guys!

OMG, I'm going to go get some right now!"}
{"text":"New to the area...wanted pizza!  Great Yelp reviews lead us here...definitely NOT disappointed!!  Caught the BOGO Rustica special (great deal!) ...hubby picked the Mediterranean and I chose the curry chicken with yams (sounded too weird to pass up...). Both were incredible! Light crust, fresh toppings, amazing flavor!  Signed up for email/text notifications on specials/coupons.  Can't wait to come back and try the Moroccan and pear/gorgonzola Rusticas!"}
{"text":"It was good.  Not cheap, but good.  We had a half cheese, half pep delivered and it was $19.  It was one of the hottest deliveries I've ever had show up at the door.

The cheese was good and the pep was tasty.  I was happy with the pie and a large fed three adults with a slice or two leftover. 

Good stuff."}
{"text":"After checkin out my fave NY&Co in AZ @ the ghetto fab Metro Center, I have a lil time before I hafta get to my next location & am starving.  Lookin for something quick & easy, I initially intend to go to Subway.  Then I see Z Pizza a few doors down & decide to check out the menu.  

They had a pretty extensive menu with salads, pastas, & sandwiches offering something for everyone.  Instantly, I'm persuaded to order the $5.95 special--2 slices of pre-made pizza & a fountain drink.  Looking @ my choices in the warmer, the pizzas had just come outta the oven, so I figure the special is a decent choice.  I go with 2 slices of the napoli with fresh tomatoes, basil & mozzarella.  It was fantastic!!!  

Location is nice too.  If you're in the mood for dessert, there's a coldstone, smoothie place, & starbux within walking distance."}
{"text":"love the pizza at this place. they even have vegan pizza! its maybe a little pricey than some other places but its worth the extra. the location is probably not the best for dining in, so id do take out."}
