{"text":"I said I like it hot, but don't kill me. I literally thought they forgot the spice even though I saw the guy put something on from a hot sauce bottle."}
{"text":"One of my favourite spot for a quick bite, always fresh, always tasty, and one of the few places which offer a decent size portion. 

but it doesn't compare to its sister location Burrito Boyz in Adelaide St. :)

Adelaide makes the real burritos huge and real spicy, this location is good but not spicy enough nor large enough.

The staff at this location are nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Simply terrible!  A violation of my taste buds! 

Had the small naked (no shell) chicken the first time. I wanted to try a different burrito joint in the area and was truly sorry I came here. I will stick with Burrito Boyz a few buildings down. Burrito Boyz make THE BEST burrito hands down. 

Back to my review of Fat Bastards... Nothing fat about it. In fact the portion size is very lean on this tiny shallow tray where the portion size was about half of B Boyz, and cost more too!  Taste wise the chicken was horrible. It was mushy and way over cooked like boiled and unseasoned shredded chicken thrown on the toppings. The rest of the toppings were also mushy too like it was a meal cooked for seniors.  

Please do your wallet and gut a big favour and avoid his place no matter how tempted you are."}
{"text":"Are you aware that there aren't enough words in the English language to describe how incredibly big, thick, juicy, and GOOD Fat Bastard Burritos are? They have some of the thickest, tightest, and most solid burritos I have ever seen. One bite us definitely worth rapturing a neck vein."}
{"text":"I should probably be more generous with the stars here because I eat there often but there are just too many better burrito joints in the city.

This location is down the street from me so I go often due to my burrito addiction. I basically always get the lil (their smallest size) bean and cheese on whole wheat. Same order I get at Burrito Bandidos but this place just gets something wrong along the way.

Beans are tasty and smokey in flavour, they offer chow mein along with the rice but I usually skip it. Bit too much starch for my liking. Then they have the usual toppings that I indulge in - lettuce, pico de gallo, jalapeno, cilantro, peppers, salsa, sour cream, burrito sauce (it's very tasty here), but they also have coleslaw which I think is gross and the vinegar dressing takes over and runs throughout the burrito. They also will crunch up some chips in there which is kind of a nice touch. Watch out for the hot sauce, I ask for a little bit which can vary depending on the person making it but it is extremely spicy. My husband likes the burn so he goes for it.

They grill the burritos which I also appreciate but again it never comes out like Bandidos. 

Try the Blair's Death Rain chips if you want to ruin your night and your taste buds! 

In conclusion, it gives me my fix when I need one and that's about it."}
{"text":"Has the steak burrito. The worst burrito I have ever had in my life. It was shredded mystery meat. Place was a mess too. I felt sad after I ate it."}
{"text":"I ordered the naked roasted chicken burrito plate with all the fixings for lunch on the recommendation of a coworker. The chicken lacked flavour and the meal was not hot. Overall the food is tasteless. I would not return."}
{"text":"Freaking skinny burritos. Buy a big naked burrito will only fill half way, might as well put it in the small box and charge me for the Lil. If you get a Lil burrito at this place expect a spring roll. If you eat meat, you're transitioning to vegetarianism at this place because it's the garnish. Not only do they skimp on meat, they skimp out on everything except the hot sauce. 

This place gives Fat Bastards such a bad rep. If you need to go to this place order at least one size up and have low expections, then lower them some more."}
{"text":"Love the food always fresh, I feel like they always skimp out on portion sizing on the food. At this location also I noticed that my fiancé food had burnt rice in it."}
{"text":"I walked in on a Saturday evening, the place was empty. That should have told me already why there's no people at this place. 
I ordered the pulled pork burrito, it was very disappointing. There were very little variety of toppings compared to other burrito places and they gave a tiny drop of guacamole. The taste was bland, I could hardly see the pulled pork in the wrap. I asked for some sauce, and was told that it's $1 extra. 
Seriously, if a customer has told you that your food is bland, you would try to make it better and not ask for extra money. Cutting down on ingredients and customer service will not help a business."}
{"text":"Burritos are good, they quality and quantity varies depending on staff. Usually go for one, once a month. Better than burrito Boyz!"}
{"text":"I ordered a small baked chicken burrito plus a side of chips and salsa. The chips were great and tasted homemade. The salsa tasted like it came from a jar full of preservatives and I only got two tiny containers or maybe 4 tablespoons for $3.99 before tax. 
The burrito was a hodge podge of everything starting with rice then refried beans plus grated cheese etc etc. Then the pancake with a huge pile of stuff is given to a cook who adds the chicken then wraps it all up and hears it up more on the grill. When I got it home and ate it the \"baked chicken\" was more like canned chicken flakes. Awful!! I would have preferred a more traditional burrito with freshly cooked chicken or beef with a side of rice and a side of received beans. I would have also hoped the salsa would be fresh. What a disappointment."}
{"text":"Love these burritos! I usually get a lil baked chicken or pulled pork and the toppings are always fresh! However, I'm writing this review because I've noticed with the new ownership the meat portions have definitely decreased. I'm super disappointed because they had such a good thing going for years! I hope my next visit is more promising. No more skimping please!! I originally would give this location a 5/5 but it's score has went down for me. Hope to see some changes soon :)"}
{"text":"You're better off at Burrito Boyz. They're extremely stingy, and one employee who I see there often is very rude and put off-ish. 

Honestly, almost $10 here for a burrito with stingy amounts of everything, or I can spend $5 at Burrito Boyz for double the amount of what they give me here.

Nah."}
{"text":"Warning. Employees here do not change gloves after touching the cash, grabbing things from the floor and getting dirty from ingredients. After not peppers for example. The staff are friendly but this to me is a huuuuge oversight."}
{"text":"Ok so I've been wanted to try fat bastard burrito for so long I just never make it out to Toronto..  Soooo I was friggin thrilled when it came on Dixie road.  

I had the big steak burrito, cost me $9 it was huge I didn't even finish it.  I liked it, very yummy, the only thing I would change is the fact that the streak is shredded so its more like I'm having pulled pork... Different 

The place is very clean and the person behind the counter was pleasant.  

I would go back and next time I would try the chicken burrito"}
{"text":"Their burittos are awesome. If you are looking for a nice buritto, they have plenty of options and even the guacs are free."}
{"text":"I've been here many times, burritos are flavoursome and good.

However what turns me off is the lack of hygiene at this place. Couple of times I did notice how the utensils were dirty or the grill was dirty but on my last visit I think I saw a bit too much to stomach. The guy mopping the dirty floor, was squeezing out a mop with his bare hands, then he simply wiped his hands on his apron before proceeding to handle food and work the cash register.

Upon seeing that, my appetite plummeted and I walked away. I don't think I'll be coming back any time soon unless the management is changed and the staff are trained properly with adequate food hygiene and handling techniques."}
{"text":"Awesome Burrito!! 

Huge portions, Great ingredients!! Friendly Staff!! 
Best Burrito I've ever had was the SPICY Chipotle Chicken! 
Also loved the pineapple soda! 
Can't wait to go BACK to try the steak!"}
{"text":"Love it. Love the noodles. Love the coleslaw. Don't love the inconsistency in quantity depending on who is working, but meh, that's life. 
Hands down way better than the Burrito Boyz across the street."}
{"text":"food - 10/10 - i have tried many items on the menu, all are great and this place actually has \"hot\" sauce that is hot!! and they warn you before you have it
service - 9/10 - the place is always busy when i order, and each time it is great.  you can get by the line fairly quick while care is still taken with food handling
location is 8/10 - parking lot is  bit tight, but the physical location is great
i highly recommend this place for some of the best and freshest tasting burritos in the city"}
{"text":"Really nice people and great service, but the chicken on my naked burrito was pretty bad.  There were big globs of soft fat and chunks of gristle in the chicken--not appealing.  I imagined how I'd react to biting into that in a regular burrito. Nasty.

The rest of the toppings were good, so maybe the deep fried buffalo chicken would be a better bet, but I'd skip the regular chicken."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Their portions are huge, and the taste...omg amazing! I never believed the hype about Fat Bastard Burritos until I tried one myself. I highly recommend the roasted steak quesadilla and also the pulled pork burrito. They've got lots of different toppings you can include in your order, and a selection of drinks that you don't normally find in other fast food restaurants. 

I thought the service was friendly and fast. I noticed another reviewer said that it took them a long time to get their burrito, but I've never had that problem. I've been there several times (during busy lunch hours and later at night around dinner time), and each time the service was really quick."}
{"text":"Flavour tastes superficial. I wasn't not impressed at all. I have been going to burrito boyz for years and this place is not there yet."}
{"text":"Fat bastard has a solid burrito. Make sure to get the hot sauce which is super spicy. I usually get 8 drops and that's pretty hot. The only reason I'm not giving it a better rating is because it's not the best burrito place on Yonge. I much prefer the more famous burrito place down the street. Fat bastard is definitely worth a try. The restaurant is small and not a place you would want to eat at unless you're in a hurry."}
{"text":"Having never tried a burrito specialty place, I wasn't quite sure of what to expect past the write-ups on Yelp.  With experience limited to a Taco Bell burrito, what came out of Fat Bastard certainly couldn't compare....a VERY good thing!  

With plentiful fresh toppings and grilled -- on all four sides, yet -- in front of your eyes (assuming you aren't the shortie stuck behind some 6-footer getting their own toppings, of course), I should have brought a scale to weigh the thing. I don't know what you can say about a burrito...it isn't high cuisine but certainly filled every nook and crannie that was available to fill.  A good deal...tastes great, fresh and plentiful...isn't that the whole story right there??!!

Am planning on the shrimp burrito next....followed by the sweet Thai chicken...followed by...well, you get the picture!"}
{"text":"I usually go to burrito boys across the street but thought I'd try something new today, big mistake. I ordered a baked chicken naked burrito and it was not very good. The portion was very small for $9. I had to keep asking the staff for more toppings as they were EXTREMELY stingy with everything. I got one half scoop of rice, a sprinkle of lettuce, and a tablespoon of salsa and guac. I asked for more and the person handling my meal didn't seem pleased that I asked and added half a table spoon of each to my meal. The chicken was very dry and bland. Overall, I didn't like the meal, didn't like the extremely small portion and didn't like the service. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Ordered a buffalo chicken + yam burrito... Didn't taste or see a single piece of chicken in it. 

This is why I don't go to any of these chain burrito places anymore. 

If I wanted a burrito full of veggies I'd be vegetarian. 

With the amount of meat the cook puts in you'd think he's buying it himself. 

Stick to chipotle for burritos."}
{"text":"Horrible Service. No communication.
Ordered $30 worth of food. waited over an hour, finally got a phone call saying they shut down and forgot to tell anyone so I wont receive the order."}
{"text":"The 'lil size is plenty big. Yam and battered fish are both delicious. However, quality for the battered fish does tend to vary -- some days the batter is light and crispy, other days it's thick and greasy. Lots of toppings to choose from, but there are a few non-standards like noodles, crunchies and coleslaw."}
{"text":"Despite all the cranky drunks that this location has to service because of the neighbourhood, I've never had any service or quality issues."}
{"text":"I would say this place is not as good as Mucho Burrito (woodbridge)

-sizes are big and filling 
-great hot sauce (made with ghost peppers)
- but I had the chipotle chicken which lacked flavour and was dry

I would go back one more time but I wouldn't have the chicken, rather I would try the ground beef, steak or fish"}
{"text":"They really don't kid around when they say go big or go home! I ordered a \"lil\" sized burrito and it was huge! I was absolutely stuffed by the time I finished eating that burrito for lunch. It makes me almost not want to even imagine what the size of the regular or huge sized burritos would be."}
{"text":"I went there today (Friday) at 2pm and I'm surprised at how busy they were. 8 people ahead of me in line and it took about 30 minutes to order my burrito and get out. 

I got a big sautéed shrimp burrito with extra shrimp which was $12 and change. As for toppings, I got everything with no beans (gross!). The burrito was extremely filling!!! I should of gotten a small however I think the extra shrimp was needed. Eating through the burrito, there didn't seem to be a lot of shrimp, however, when I got to the bottom of my burrito, I had 6 shrimps in my last three bites. I know there's nothing they could do about it, but I wish they were spread out in the burrito more. 

The store is super small so you really have to take it to go. They do have about 8-10 stools you can sit on, but they really aren't comfortable. It's always crowded inside and if you come during the week around 12, I hope you have at least an hour lunch! The line is always outside the door. 

All in all, for the limited about of burrito places especially in Scarborough, I'll definitely make my way back here!"}
{"text":"Great burrito - I got the lil chicken with all the standard toppings and hot sauce on the side. I took it to go and it was still warm and delicious when I got home about 15 minutes later. 

Special mention to the staff - the girl working the counter tonight was so friendly and had a huge smile on her face. Whenever she wasn't busy taking orders she was cleaning and organizing everything. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I tried this place one night with my wife we got the tequila lime chicken burrito, it was very good but also expensive. I couldn't see myself eating here more than a couple times a year just because it's so big but if you're definitely craving something different this is a good call. The name says it all, come hungry."}
{"text":"Best Burrito/Quesadillas/Mexican restaurant in Toronto! Simply put it: this is a true mexican food experience u must try. I ordered Veggie Quesadilla and my buddy ordered Baja Chipotle Chicken Burrito and it was both awesome and delicious. 10x vetter than Chipotle & any other mexican restaurant in town."}
{"text":"Stop lying Carlo . U work for fat bastard burrito. I tried ,food is no good. Cheap and u hade to wait for ever. This is beaches . Let see how long fat bastard will survive at beaches."}
{"text":"I was introduced to this place by a friend. Hands down the best burrito I have had. It was quick and filling. The staff was accommodating to my dietary restrictions and had a good understanding of the different ingredients used to in the burrito AND sauces. The staff was helpful and friendly, while serving delicious burritos."}
{"text":"Tried the Baja chicken and ground beef. Tasty and fresh burritos. Recommend the deep fried Mars bar, really good!! All in all very good experience and must eat if you like burritos. 

+ tasty
+ fresh
+ large burritos 
+ good size menu options
+ wide variety of toppings 
+ friendly staff 
+ no extra charge for guacamole 

- no cons"}
{"text":"Fat Bastard Burrito, I LOVE YOU! I usually get a naked burrito with all the fixings (+ guacamole is free!!!!) Great value for your money ($6.99 for a \"lil\" size). Don't be fooled though, it certainly isn't lil! You always leave feeling like you've gained five pounds (or so.)

I have always LOVED Chipotle's Burrito Bowls, but Fat Bastard Burrito is a great alternative. It's cheaper and has a lot of great toppings too. Try it out :)"}
{"text":"We went to this place around lunchtime on a Wednesday. There were a few people but no line. They took our orders promptly. 

The service I got was good. They asked me what I wanted in my ground beef burrito. I said everything. I asked for extra jalapeño and hot sauce as well as sour cream and burrito sauce. There were lots of toppings - green peppers, onions, guacamole, salsa, tomatoe salsa, cilantro, fried rice, beans, chow mein, grated cheese, pickled cabbage. Also, don't forget to include crunchies - they will add tortilla chips upon request!

The burrito skin was soft, fresh , chewy and grilled to perfection. The burrito was crisp on the outside and soft and tasty on the inside. The ground beef was tasty, moist and with the right amount of spice. The inside of the burrito was hot as it should be.

We ordered a Lil which is a small in fat bastard speak. This was more than enough - we were sooooo stuffed. The portions was generous depending on who you got to make your burrito. The damage was around $8 for each burrito. The only thing that I wished they had was lie rice and fresh corn salsa. 

My usual places are burrito boys and burrito banditos. If I am in the beaches, this would not be a bad option. Would definitely go to try some of the other flavours. They had for a $1 more butter chicken, Thai chicken, steak, spicy chipotle chicken and a many other premium meats and fish."}
{"text":"Good food but horribly slow service and nowhere to park. Went in for a small bean and cheese burrito on a Sunday night at 7:30pm, shouldn't be long right? Waited 25 minutes! Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Very average, Ive been 4 times and each time I ask myself why I go back - the west end of the city needs some better options"}
{"text":"Don't come here unless you want to be mistreated.  I haven't taste t food yet,  but I've already decided not to come back ever.  The guy at the cash treated us as if we were implied to know their menu details and exclusions.  Didn't take 2 secs to let us know the beverage options included on the  combo and got upset when we asked for a jar to instead of a canned pop.

The girl preparing the burritos was very cheap with the toppings and also expected us to know what everything was.

Overall terrible service"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. The flavours are amazing. The service is great. The servers talk to you and make you feel comfortable. If you are new to Burritos, they help you decide which type of burrito do you like. 
The owner of the place is amazing.. he would come to you and ask what are the changes we would like. Would recommend a new flavour would ask question related to it, if you like it or not."}
{"text":"Fat Bastard is providing us with a great food option when you consider other choices in the neighborhood. The \"burritos\" are large, not too expensive, and filled with lots of meat and seeming fresh ingredients. The staff is friendly and the place is clean.
     However the only thing Mexican in this place is the Jumex in the fridge. As with most burrito places in Toronto, they are on their own path as far as how to put a burrito together. They have some taste, but it's a far cry from what a true burrito should taste like. How you can make a burrito without  freshly made salsa is just nonsense....right there your pulling garlic, onion, and cilantro from the mix! Continuing with the Toronto process they are using cheddar cheese as well as putting your fully prepared burrito on a hot grill to heat it up. I'm sorry but if the meat, beans, and rice are hot and you steam the tortilla to melt the cheese your all set. It's takes 1/4 of the time and who wants to eat hot guacamole wrapped in a hard tortilla. I see all of this as a lack of vision on the behalf of the owners. A small investment in traveling to California and visiting Taquerias in L.A., and San Francisco's Mission district or any other neighborhood in S.F. would provide Toronto with a invaluable injection of culture and great food. 
    All that said I will be back to Fat Bastard, as it is good food at a great price. I only hope that they expand their options to include more authentic ingredients, until then I'll tell myself that I'm eating a really good wrap."}
{"text":"I have tried every burrito here and I would say they have amazing steak and pulled pork burritos compared to burrito boyz. The only thing I have a problem with this fat b's is that there ingredients arent consistently fresh. They put the cheese in the middle of the burrito where the heat cant reach so it doesnt melt and is cold. If they fix these 2 problems they wont have any competition against burrito boyz."}
{"text":"Amazing flavour and packed to the brim, these burrito are fresh and filling. Great meat options to pick from and my veggie friend got their veg freshly sautéed. You get free chips and dip which is cool. But he only reason i took a star off is that the burritos do fall apart, its a very messy meal."}
{"text":"This would be a decent option for Etobicoke if there wasn't a BBoyz nearby.  They make an alright burrito, if lacking in some flavour.  I like that they have gone outside of the usual traditional offerings and thrown in some interesting options (I should have tried the noodles instead of rice, but wanted a level playing field).  They seem to have a thing for hot sauce, which I also appreciate, and you can buy some of their hot ghost peppers if you're feeling brave enough to cook with them yourself.

If they get the meat seasoning improved, they could still hold their own I think.  Still a few kinks to work out."}
{"text":"They truly live up to the second word in their namesake. What a fucking joke - ordered a steak burrito with medium heat and received a mild pulled pork. When I confronted the cook about the error, he insisted that what I had was steak. Yeah, what a load of shit. I pointed out that the burrito I had wasn't spicy (a further indication that they mixed up orders) and he just tossed me a cup of spicy sauce.

The burrito itself was a massive letdown, even for someone who usually enjoys pulled pork. Watery, mushy, lukewarm."}
{"text":"This establishment is incredibly dirty. The woman handling the cash register was also handling food workout washing her hands or a glove. All of the toppings were mixed together and messy. Another woman came back from her break and handled our food without washing her hands. We asked for our money back and she immediately complied because she recognized she had not washed her hands. We then got yelled at by another staff member who seemed to think we were being rude by questioning the cleanliness of the establishment. She yelled \"oh ya let me come to your house and eat off the floor because I'm sure it's clean.\" The whole situation was  absurd and embarrassing for them. Gross."}
{"text":"Consistently good burritos. But, for some asinine reason they insist on having terrible music in their tiny space turned up to 11. It's really inconvenient when ordering, not to mention super annoying. I would go there more often if it wasn't such a miserable experience."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken quesadilla and it was tasty! It came with the usual toppings: cheese, green onions, green peppers, etc... And a side of salsa & sour cream. I'd definitely come back here. One thing you can't do here though is use the bathroom since there doesn't seem to be one weirdly enough!"}
{"text":"Excellent taste, generous proportion, free chips and salsa = awesome experience. The small size is actually good enough if you're looking for a quick bite and a lighter lunch. They have both noodles and rice as stuffing for the burrito which is a pleasant change. I took the bean and cheese burrito with noodles and all toppings and asked them to make it spicy. The burrito was yummy and the spice level on the spot - when you say it is spicy and not fake spicy. I have also tried the Yam burrito .. It is yummy too .. Although I felt the yam pieces were a little too big for my liking although I liked the taste of sweet, spicy and cheesy together. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Identical to the Queensway location.  Not quite as generous with the toppings, but the \"lil\" size is still plenty big enough.  Although, I had to ask for more beans on mine, and at first the server said no, quoting the reason as me having ordered the 'lil.  So I had to point out that I had ordered the bean and cheese burrito - it was definitely deserving of more beans.  When she realized what I had ordered, she agreed and happily obliged.

No stools or chairs yet - just a few cruiser tables...  so we took ours to go.  Place seems clean.  Customer service was sort of dismal.   I'm sure they'll make a killing on the lunch crowd though!  And if they stay open late, they'll be busy for the after the bar crowd too."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Slow and grumpy staff. The guy pretended not to hear me when I asked for a specific topping. Next time I'm going to Burrito Boyz across the street ."}
{"text":"Been twice now. They're friendly but very slow. Burritos have no taste and are bland and I've felt sick both times after eating. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is great and the staff at this location are very friendly. One night after finishing a late work shift, I arrived here 10 min. to closing and felt bad that they were already cleaning up and starting to pack away some stuff. But they were still more than willing to serve me, reassured me that it was no trouble at all, and even kept up a good conversation while I waited for my food :) 

They do get really busy during peak lunch and dinner hours and there were a few times where I had to wait a bit to receive my order. However, that didn't really bother me as I was in no rush. I would recommend that if you do decide to go during those hours that you call in your order instead.

Overall, this place is great! Hands down my go-to burrito joint."}
{"text":"Ordered three burritos and got the butter chicken, Baja chipotle chicken and a sautée veggie. I have to say I am seriously disappointed. I mean, for the price, it IS huge and they do really stuff it... but it tasted very bland. I tried both the butter chicken and the Baja chipotle chicken expecting an explosion of flavour, but there was barely any chicken, and definitely minimal flavour. I almost didn't want to eat it. However, the veggies were fresh, and the hot sauce was pretty good too. The employees were also nice, I was really excited to try this place, it's a shame the food didn't live up to expectation. Unfortunately, I won't be back."}
{"text":"I wanted a burrito delivered to me and I totally thought they delivered because of the big WE DELIVER sign but I guess they don't.... deliver. Ok."}
{"text":"Had the pulled pork burrito. It wasn't a special but it was pretty yummy. They were not very generous with their portions of guacamole. My friend had the chipotle chicken burrito and according to her the hot sauce was great."}
{"text":"Eclectic! Yeah, this burrito place will add unexpected items to your burrito and make it taste absolutely delicious! 

I ordered the \"sweet chili Thai chicken burrito\" ...I have no clue how those words can even go together, but they did, in my burrito, and it was very tasty. I got the usual ingredients - peppers, cilantro, guacamole, tomato, lettuce, beans and skipped the noodles. My partner got the sauteed shrimp burrito and the ratio of seafood to rest of the ingredients was perfect.

Check this place out next time you are in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"i used to love fat bastards and ate some of their locations and they were good and most locations are alot fresher and do things properly, but this one falls behind the bar by a mile
you should avoid this place at all cost tbh, the place its just nasty so you all know i'll explain.

they cook during the week for their weekend which is horrible for a place that claims to be \"fresh\" they cook chicken/steak/pork on Wednesday and Thursday for friday/saturday. so if u come in on a weeked your meat would be a couple days old by now.

their fish is precook in the morning  and they just heat it up when u order it which is not bad except its batter so if you come at night you get a fish thats been sitting for hours in a warmer, not fresh at all

their staff is trained to be cheap as possible in the burritos , their reasoning \"meat is expensive so give only a little\"  if you order a burrito they place as little as possible meat in the burrito, order a naked and you get somewhat close to the actual portion you suppose to get, order both and you will see the difference in portions for the same size meal.

their yam is baked then chill and they reheated in the same fryer where fish is cook .

hopefully fat bastard head office reads this and does something about it.

you can confirm this when they pull meats from the fridge they are label with dates so if you have good vision you can catch the date when it was made. watch their fish or yam when they throw it in the fryer and you can see the fish was already cook."}
{"text":"Hot dang was that ever a good burrito! I just got a \"lil\" yam burrito that proved to be HUGE and I've got no complaints. Good food. Decent service. One of the only places that stays open until 10 on Sunday in the area. Nice to have a third option after Metro and the Shawarma joint."}
{"text":"These burritos are HUGE and I only got the lil size! I was intrigued by the noodles but didn't try them, a step too far for a burrito traditionalist like me. I did however get the crunchies which was a good move. Losing a couple of stars because the chicken was too salty and there wasnt enough choice of salsa."}
{"text":"I had a small steak burrito and it was more than enough for lunch. The steak was plentiful, if a bit greasy. It had all the right components but, unfortunately, this just did not taste like a burrito. This is the first time I have encountered this problem at one of these new-wave burrito bars. I consider this to be a fairly major drawback. I left feeling irritated about the wasted calories! Also annoying that there isn't any hot sauce available to add yourself. I like to add as I eat. Wouldn't go back to any of FB's restaurants on the basis of this experience."}
{"text":"Holy scrumptious batman! This is the best burrito I have ever had. Ever.
The staff are friendly (and helpful if you're a newby) and the burrito was tasty and full of yummy ingredients.

I had the baked chicken burrito with guac, beans, green peppers, rice, and tomatoes.
I got the \"Lil\" burrito because I knew I'd never be able to polish off a \"regular\" size, and it was just right for me.

I will be back you Fat Bastard."}
{"text":"I didn't eat here because the cashier took the order of the person behind me first therefore this place sucks"}
{"text":"Love this place. Friendly owner who is always working. Toppings are fresh and the option of crunchies is huge!

I go so often they know my order before I say it. Big fish!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch with teammates and was very disappointed from the get go. Hygiene was a concern for me. 
None of the staff wore gloves to prep my pulled pork burrito, chips & guac. 
The guy at the grill grabbed the burrito with his bare hands which I'm guessing was too hot so he wiped his hands on his pants. I Handed him my receipt and got my order before he proceeded with the next order without washing his hands.
Rice was over cooked, chips was stale and the guacamole was bland. 
Won't be returning!"}
{"text":"I ordered from this location through foodora. My friend got a burrito bowl and there was no rice, and it was soggy and totally watery. I ordered a large pulled pork burrito and it was tiny!! I ate the whole thing and I'm not even full. There wasn't enough rice or toppings inside, last time I ordered chicken and it way too salty. My friend had to throw hers out because it was gross! I wouldn't order from here again. They don't give nearly large portions and the meat itself is bleh."}
{"text":"I went in not too long after they opened and ordered a Yam Burrito Bowl. Firstly, they charge the same money for vegetarian and Meat options (which is ridiculous because meat obviously costs more). But since I was paying $10 for a burrito bowl, I figured I would get lots of veggies and yam. Boy, was I disappointed! They skimped on veggies AND yam - there were barely any veggies (most of the bowl was filled with rice and beans) and they only gave me 3 tiny pieces of yam on top. For the money I'm paying, I'd much rather walk a little further and get Chipotle instead. Not a fan and will not be going back.

Vegetarians, look elsewhere! They will overcharged and under-deliver!"}
{"text":"I'm normally a fan of Fat Bastard Burrito but this is the WORST location I've been to and I think it ruins the good brand that it has. The burrito itself was also terrible. I ordered a large baha chicken which looked like a small one. I'm usually not one to complain but I've eaten so many of these burritos that I can tell when I've been short changed and this is the one instance. They said they wrapped it really tight. While watching them make it, there may have been a sliver of guac that was put on whereas if you went to a competitor (Chipotle, Burrito Boyz, Quesada) they would have put on at least 3 times as much guac.

I would not recommend going to this location and I think if they keep this out, they'll continue to be empty. I don't normally have bad experiences that are worth noting but this is definitely the worse. I will not be coming back here as my money is better spent somewhere else and not wasted here."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. Don't waste your time going here. WORST when it comes to toppings. I've been to other locations in Toronto and have never had this problem. Aren't burrito loaded with toppings?? Anyways don't waste your money here go to another location or somewhere else."}
{"text":"Amazing burritos! The best I have ever had and I continue to try new places and am always disappointed. The owner/manager Marc is super friendly! They messed up my order once. It was no big deal. I let Marc know and he said the next one would be on him. He remembered me the next time I came in and took of me like he promised. Very pleased with the service and food quality and taste! Highly recommend this location. Others have not been so friendly."}
{"text":"This place is a great addition to the area. The meat is seasoned perfectly which makes this place way better than burrito boyz. For those with a monster appetite or looking for leftovers get the huge which is just about impossible to finish on one sitting. The only problem with this place is the service poor but in any case this place is worth a try."}
{"text":"New location in Brampton. Went there tonight and got a large naked steak and chicken bowl. Portion size is average. Quality and taste was great. Both meats were surprisingly juicy, especially the steak. My only complaint about it is they shred the steak meat. I prefer chunks or strips. Other than that, it was a pretty good experience all around. Clean store, friendly staff, average value. I'll definitely be returning"}
{"text":"We have been waiting to try this burrito place, and tonight we finally got our chance.

We were greeted by the staff behind the counter, and at first they were helpful explaining the different sizes and types of burritos they offered. The ordering was quick, and we moved on to the toppings.  Not sure about why noodles would be added to a burrito, but maybe I'll give it a try next time.  The usual toppings were offered, though I found it a little frustrating that I had to ask what each of them were, and it wasn't until I was almost home that I realized I'd forgotten to get jalapeños. Good thing the hot sauce I asked for was hot enough.

I ordered the special burrito of the week which was a red ale chicken supposedly with some heat.  The rest of my family ordered various forms of chicken, and one ground beef.

The sizes were plenty, and the flavours were good. One complaint was that there were not enough vegetables in the toppings.

Overall I was satisfied and I will try another one on another day."}
{"text":"In my opinion, this place is perfect for a cheat meal :)
They have multiple choices of burritos, that is not available in other places.
And you can customize it to any option you want.
The burritos are tasty too, not necessarily the healthiest (but as I mentioned if you are feeling like cheating this is the place to be).
One drawback is the lack of seating, rarely you will find a place to sit down and eat. Hopefully they will expand the seating space."}
{"text":"Honestly these are my favorite burritos in Toronto. This location in particular seems to have the best mix of vegetables and salsas. They are unreal! 

My favorite part of their burritos is sauce and noodles that you can mix in with the rice and beans. Their vegetables are always fresh and the salsa and pico is great.

$9 for a burrito that will fill you up for a month. $12 if you plan on hibernating this winter."}
{"text":"Nothing obliterates drunk hunger than one of these bad boys!

There are probably better burritos to be had in the city but these guys do a pretty good job.

My go-to burrito is definitely, without doubt, the sauteed shrimp. It's absolutely delicious every time and their hot sauce is actually pretty damn hot (but only if you ask for \"extra hot sauce\"). Leaves me in a sweaty mess for at least 20 minutes afterwards but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"I come here out of convenience, as its right beside my apartment. The pulled pork one is pretty tasty, but they are skimpy with the toppings.

When I order the veggie burrito, I don't understand why I'm paying the same price as the meat ones. They honestly only add 1 or 2 sautéed pepper pieces. I wish they would at least add more guacamole or something!"}
{"text":"Ok so just like the others I was very excited when fat bastard opened at Victoria park and Sheppard. However this place does not match up to the fat bastard at warden and Elglinton. I hoped for it to get better but didn't. I got a half cooked ground beef burrito last night and it was very dry and powdery. I have also noticed that their quality degrades if you go there late at night. I would rather have them close early than stay open till 1 am and serve crap. Next time I go to fat bastard it will be at warden and eglinton. The one at Vic park and Sheppard doesn't seem to be improving."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, delicious food and a very clean restaurant! Guac is included in the price. I'd recommend the fish tacos, they're crispy and leave you with a clean full feeling."}
{"text":"I got the big fish (naked) for lunch today but for some reason I got 5 pieces of fish the size of chicken nuggets! I have been attending this location weekly but today was not a great day.
Fish was cold and small and didn't seem like it was just cooked. Maybe time to switch to Ravi soups..."}
{"text":"I love the naked burrito option! Also the hot sauce is crazy hot so get dots before lines."}
{"text":"Normally when I get the naked bowl it is so great!! This time epic fail!! Will likely not get it again. Super disappointed."}
{"text":"I just finished eating lunch here and I'm really happy with my decision to come here.  

Firstly,the staff is vwry friendly and they make your order very quickly. 

The restaurant was very clean and had a fun vibe. 

The burrito was delicious, they have the option of putting noodles in your burrito which was a different but delicious experience. 

I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a good burrito and good service."}
{"text":"Two years ago, I happened to come across this particular Fat Bastard burritos. At the time, I had only just moved into the city and always had a mental reminder to eat there. 2 years later, and I'm finished School, I have new friends and I've all but left my previous life behind. Today I walked an unusual path and came across this place. Remembering my old promise to myself I thought I'd give it an honest shot.

It was smaller than I thought. Enough room for you to get your food and get out. I've never eaten at a Fat Bastards before so I didn't get much time to really absorb most of their menu. I opted for the basic chicken burrito, and decided on the \"huge\" size. Their topping selection was fairly basic for a burrito joint. Though I noticed that they had doritos available as \"crunchies\", which I assumed were to add a bit of a crisp. I wasn't too sure how I'd feel about that so I left it alone. I asked for hot sauce and the employee made sure I meant hot sauce. Then he asked if I'd ever tried it before. When I said \"no\", he instinctively grabbed a dorito and squeezed a droplet of the sauce on it. I smirked and took the bite.
Now, I'm a Sri Lankan dude, and so when I insist on one thing in this universe, it's that I will drench everything in the hottest sauce I can find. That being said, this drop of hot sauce punched me right in the throat. I definitely wasn't expecting it. \"Medium instead?\" the employee offered to which I nodded in defeat. 

I took the burrito home and nestled into my couch with a beer and Netflix at the ready. It was a little more chewy than I would have hoped. I think the employee added more beans than I would have preferred. This resulted in a chalky texture that permeated throughout the rest of the burrito. Occasionally small pops of spice would crackle through but I can't help but wonder if the hot sauce would have been so bad if I ate it with the rest of the burrito. Either way, the spice wasn't to my satisfaction, but I have myself to blame for that.

I do intend on coming back again. Though I noticed a Burrito Boys right across the street. I've had really good experiences there before. The parking area also seemed a lot better, which to mention right now, was a nightmare to exit from. The parking area for the plaza was tiny. So small that backing out of a parking spot essentially put you on the main road. On the queensway. And at rush hour, this was far more of an ordeal than it should have been. Still, not entirely a deal breaker, but definitely not something fun to deal with every time I want to eat a burrito from them.

All in all, decent food. Good service. I appreciate the employee taking the time to ask me about the hot sauce and give me a free sample just to be sure. Though I'm unsure of whether or not eating a drop of it on a small nacho exemplifies how it would taste while masked with a dozen other ingredients. Either way, recommended."}
{"text":"Portions are a large; service is slow. The food tasted fine, not amazing. Downgraded to 3 stars because the chicken looks and tastes like canned. It has a texture like canned tuna, but tastes chicken-ish."}
{"text":"I used to come here because they were good, but they started to get cheap and charging for every little thing like sauce. I can't get the regular sauce they offer because it is egg based, without any other options, I have to get the special sauces, but they suddenly started charging me $1 for it. $1 for a small line of tequila lime sauce? Are you kidding me? I just ordered 2 huge size burritos and each one gets charged $1 because they gave me no other options. 

This is the last time I come here. Lost a regular weekly customer. Good thing I found out now before I took my meet up group of 30 here."}
{"text":"These burritos are crazy large. I've been to most burrito places around the city but this is the biggest burrito that I've ever seen. I felt guilty seeing that huge mound of filling as they were adding it, knowing that it was all eventually going into my stomach.  We went at 6 pm on a Friday and only had to wait 10 minutes or so.  

The burrito itself was packed full of flavour and I could taste every ingredient. I ordered the pulled pork but the other flavours tended to drown out the pork taste. I'll probably try the ground beef or steak next time.  Towards the end, it fell apart but a tortilla can only hold so much before it gives way.

At $7.99 for a \"big\" size, it's a good deal and I'll probably visit the upcoming Vic Park/Sheppard location over and over."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Big burritos. If you get the huge you better be prepared for a big meal. Can easily feed 2."}
{"text":"Food is alright but the staff always seem like there in a bad mood."}
{"text":"I met a tour guide who told tourists Fat Bastard Burrito was the best restaurant in Toronto. I did not agree with him, but I did not say anything. I do not know why they have to put rice and noodles in Burrito just because there are many Asians in Toronto. I do not think it was tasty because of too much carbs and not so much flavor. Not bad, but there are many other good places."}
{"text":"came here at about 7pm and service wasn't too bad. Orders the fish tacos and I was so disappointed you have no idea. LOOK AT THE PORTION OF FISH YOU GET its like half a fillet of fish cut into 6 pieces LOL ITS COMICAL. You can't taste the fish when you eat it hand to God. Also the batter on the fish was way too rock hard crunchy it ruined the taco. The toppings inside included a bit of coleslaw which I usually don't like but it was good and 2-4 pieces of diced tomato and green onion. You know you have a problem wth your taco when you taste the tortilla more than the actual inside toppings. Save your $12 and just go to chipotle!!"}
{"text":"First let me preface by saying that my girlfriend and I should be equity owners in this franchise, as we spend the equivalent of rent at this place.

This has far surpassed Burrito Boyz in terms of taste, quality and uniqueness. The portions are plentiful, the staff is great and the wait times are limited. It's always busy which is a great sign of a successful restaurant and despite the lines, the staff are on point and prepared. 

One great thing about this place is that we always go to it after we workout at LA Fitness. Actually, sometimes we go to this place and skip LA entirely. Oh well!

The one downside is the limited seating, and this only becomes a problem during the harsh winter weather. 

My favourite burrito here is the Tequilla Lime Chicken burrito. I've tried others but always go back to this gem. 

Even the smallest burrito is huge so if you have a small appetite, definitely choose the smallest one. I believe the biggest one is 2lbs so that would require quite the stomach. 

The employees always let me put in extra toppings. The crunchy tortillas broken up are the best part of the burrito as they give it a crunchiness that seals the deal. 

4/5 with the 1 star being taken away for limited seating. The employees are great and friendly and if you are a regular they will take care of you."}
{"text":"Took my daughter here after a hockey game was pleasantly surprised huge portion with great flavor, we ordered 1 baked chicken 1 steak both were excellent!  to my surprise we both fineshed. Will be back again."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend after seeing longer line-ups at other places nearby (including other burrito places). The food was OK, enjoyed the yam burrito, and portion size was good. We both mentioned that we wished we had waited for the meal we really wanted instead!"}
{"text":"This place was fun.   The servings are huge and the fillings very tastey, although my wife did think her burrito was a bit dry.   I enjoyed the noodle option for a burrito filling. 

Seating is a bit limited, but as a take out option it would work very well.   I'd go back if I didn't live 600 miles away."}
{"text":"This was my second time visiting FBB This time I decided to try the Lime tequila chicken burrito and it was definitely good. Service was quick and all toppings are included. Tip have them bake all four sides"}
{"text":"Best Fat Bastard location I've been to. Great customer service and they aren't cheap with the portions. The burritos taste better than most other locations too. Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"False advertising all the way with the \"frea*in huge burrito\" signs all over the walls. Portion size is absurd, the girl working was legit counting the thinly sliced green peppers she was adding to my burrito. I asked for more and she added two more slices.

Chicken was sparse as well.

Overall burrito looked more like a wrap it was so thin and long and hungry looking.

If I'm gonna spend $11 on a burrito again, I'll do it at Chipotle down the street where they know how to make a burrito. They have much better customer service too."}
{"text":"Great taste and fair pricing. Got take out obviously since zero seating area for a family. Since this place seems to be a take out place was a bit disappointed with the fact that the guys forgot napkins in the bag (big no no) and also a minor preference for sour creams instead of salsa ... but I'll chalk it up to being a late night for them. 

Anyhow what they may have lacked in service, they did, however, make up in flavour. My husband opted for a shrimp burrito - it was ok - the shrimps were scarce. my kids got the fish burrito and that was way better especially because they actually seemed to be more meat in there but it could have been the breading. I would have preferred just a grilled fish in there. 

I decided on a shrimp quesadilla and was thoroughly satisfied. I loved loved the flavour, I didn't love the small portion of shrimp - also the cheese seemed stingy. Still I will try it again"}
{"text":"Can't help constantly coming back for more burritos/quesadillas.  Guac is included in most items!  Other restaurants need to learn this: guac is a right, not a privilege."}
{"text":"Better than Burrito Boyz. 

Great little place not really meant to eat in. 
But what I love most about FB is that they use noodles and crushed chips. 
I know at first you think .... noodles ..ships in a burrito?  
But it really sets this apart from other burritos. The flavor is great and WOW they don't charge extra for Guacamole or any other extra toppings you add....amazing concept (pffftt..Mucho Burrito) 
The only issue I have found with this location is that it gets busy. So busy that a lot of times they run out of stuff. one time they ran out of cheese, they have ran out of chicken and steak. I have also been there 3 separate times where there debit machine stopped working and I had to go next door to take out cash. 
All in all ..while the burritos wont blow you away .. they taste way better than BB and any of the other trashy healthy super expensive burrito places that give you a table spoon of meat and then charge you an extra $1 for Guacamole !!  How can you charge extra for that? This isn't Subway this is a Burrito shop....Guacamole should always be free on a Burrito."}
{"text":"We've made many orders and been happy, but the service this time was SO awful, we'll never come back.
My burrito came with no guac (that I paid for!) and two of our burritos that were supposed to be mild were so spicy they were inedible. We ordered mild. The other two people that ordered mild were not at all spicy.

When I called to let them know there was a problem, they were incredibly rude and treated me like I was lying. \"But I only put one drop of hot sauce on!\"... we ordered mild, there was no option for no sauce, why would you put any of your crazy spicy sauce on it?
They asked us to return the burrito before they would give a new one, and told us it was going to be a long time because they had other orders to go out. This is after the initial order took well over an hour and a half to come. That would have made it almost 10pm. That was the only thing they were willing to do for me.

Terrible customer service. They were rude and dismissive, and much as we've been happy before we will never order again."}
{"text":"Reliably good tequila lime burritos. Would have rated 4 stars, but they blast the worst pop music at very uncomfortable levels, requiring everyone to constantly repeat themselves to be understood. As soon as I walk in, I want to leave. All the customers are standing around visibly wincing in reaction. It's gotten so ridiculously loud, that after literally years of being a regular customer, I'm done."}
{"text":"I have been on a burrito bonanza this week; my first stop was Fat Bastard Burrito (FBB) in Liberty Village.  This location just opened up in the area and I have been meaning to try out their burritos.

FBB menu has a unique menu selection; offering burritos in various sizes, quesadillas and they even have dessert options (deep fried mars bars!).  I got the \"Lill\" which was a descent dinner portion, I can't imagine what the larger sizes are like.  Their toppings/fillings are pretty standard with the exception of a couple - coleslaw and crunchies.

Overall my chicken burrito with the toppings I selected was average; I found the rice very dry and refried beans took over the burrito taste. Maybe I should have asked for more burrito sauce?!

If you want to check out a unique menu, FBB should be on your list."}
{"text":"Prices a tad high, quality of food rather excellent, customer service could use some polishing.

So m'lady and I decided to go for a dinner and a movie, so we went to get some burritos from this venue.

We liked how the food for both of us was prepared so that both of our meals were prepared at the same time, temperature was proper, as well the texture and overall the taste was quite excellent. Where we were disappointed was where the attendant who placed the toppings called m'lady \"ma'am\". She found this rather offensive, and swore to never step foot at this venue again, even though she rather enjoyed her meal there.

So with that in mind, I'd probably return there on my own at some point, however it wouldn't be very soon or very often, as I find the prices to be a bit high (although the amount of food for the dollar amount is fairly decent)."}
{"text":"One of the tastiest burritos I've had in Toronto, and I am really critical about my burritos. The have a great variety of ingredients which are always fresh, and they never cheap out on anything. Portions are fairly substantial; even their \"big\" burrito - the medium size - is filling enough for me. The food is great, but what really sells this place for me is the customer service.

My last experience wasn't great. I bought 3 burritos to go, and when I got home 10 minutes later they were really cold from the inside. I'm not sure how, but maybe they just weren't toasted thoroughly. I called them and said I was unsatisfied because I expected the burritos to be hot; there's no point in buying freshly made burritos and microwaving them 10 minutes after that. It wasn't even a big deal; I was just disappointed that this experience was worse than my past dealings with them. The manager asked me for my name, and credited me for 3 burritos.

Fast forward a week to yesterday; I walked in and asked for the manager, hoping that he would remember our verbal agreement over the phone. He profusely apologized for the negative experience I had with them last time, and got me the 3 burritos we agreed to. And when I ordered a quesadilla on top of that, he said it was on the house. The manager made sure that they were hot enough this time, handed the order to me personally, and thanked me for my continued business.

The mistake they made really wasn't even that big of a deal like I said, since it was my first negative experience with them. It's important to me that they owned up to it, and even went above and beyond what I expected. I'm definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"I bought a lil bowl with pulled pork two days ago. The pork was very dry and there was hardly any sauce on it. It looked like it had been sitting out in a pan for a long time."}
{"text":"Found this place while looking for the Beer Store.  For all you yanks who have never been to Canada, you can't just go into any old convenience store to pick up a six pack, you have to go to a government owned store that sells beer only.  Anyway this place wa$10.60s right next door and it looked interesting enough for me to try it.

Place is set up a little like chipotle, you have your choice of proteins and they stuff the burrito with a variety of toppings of your choice.  There are three sizes, regular, big and huge.  I ordered the huge shredded steak burrito with wheat tortilla which set me back $10.60.  They grill the burrito after stuffing it making it a bit sturdy for eating.

Burrito was OK, you got meat, peppers, onions, cheese, tomatoes, guacamole, hummus,... no sour cream that I could see.  Burrito was fresh and satisfying with the right amount of heat.  Restaurant itself was small and more of a \"take out\" kind of place.  There are seats up front near the window if you want to eat here.  I don't recommend it as it seems a bit cramped.

Burrito is filling and just a tad overpriced.  But this is Toronto so I imagine everything is overpriced.  I consider the burrito adequate but there are better places.  So this place is best served if you in a hurry and looking for take out."}
{"text":"There are a lot of topping options. My favorites are:   noodle, pico, garlilc sauce.  I had my jalapegno and hot sauce on the side, since my friend doesn't like spicy.  The hot sauce is really hot for some people.  My friend tried it and I could see from her reaction that it burned her and she said it was too hot for her.  I on the other loved the hot sauce - I could drink it.  It's a small place, so if there is seating it's minimal.  We took our burrrito to go.  The huge is perfect for sharing with one other person.  I don't mind paying a premium price for premium food, but Fat Bastard has not earned that level.  Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Service is super slow so I wouldn't recommend it for \"quick\" takeout.  I had the fried battered fish burrito, with almost all the toppings (lots to choose from and there is also a whole wheat tortilla option).  It was just OK in my books, I wasn't wowed or blown away.  Generous portion as I didn't finish mine though I felt like there was more batter in my burrito than actual fish.  I'm usually immune to hot sauce since I use so much of it but did feel a little bit of heat from their house hot sauce. 2 \"big\" burritos and 2 tamarind sodas came up to about $25.  I'd probably eat there again if I was in the area but don't think I'd trek over there specifically for a burrito."}
{"text":"I like big food. I like mexican food. I like burritos. Put it all together and this place is perfect for what i'm looking for.

There are several places like this but each have their own specialty. In my opinion, Burrito Boyz is own to be one of the first burrito places. Chino Locos is known for their korean/asian inspired burritos incorporating bulgogi and chow main in their burritos. ZTeca is known for their simplicity and sitting area. Fat Bastard is known for their massive sizes, choice and uniqueness of toppings. They have 3 different sizes: little, big and huge. You can choose from two lists of meats (premium and regular). For toppings you can have rice, chow mein and/or beans. Then top it off with the usual guac, salsa, cliantro, sour cream etc etc. But then comes the interesting part.. their hot sauce and chips. Their hot sauce is preeeettttyyy hot but delicious. You'll feel the pain for sure. They also break up their very own nacho chips into small pieces and add them to the burrito for texture. It all works out very well together.

Pricing wise my big (medium) size burrito was $13 after tax and including my extra meat with it. It's not cheap but totally worth it.

The restaurant is a decent size, concentrating on more so quick fast food style eating. You walk in, lineup, order and wait for your burrito based on your receipt number. You can choose to chill around the high stand up tables to eat or take it out. It's lively and loud with a large tv, usually playing NBA TV for some reason.

It is located along Victoria Park just south of Sheppard at a small strip plaza. Parking is limited, especially during lunch hours considering it's across the street from a tonne of corporate buildings. If you don't want to wait for your food then you have plenty of other options.

Overall, i like this place a lot more then the other burrito themed spots. Funny thing is burritos are never like this in Mexico so consider this a fusion and completely made up creation.

Higly recommended."}
{"text":"One of the best places to get a burrito
For ten dollars you can get one that's 10 inches long and so wide that you have to hold it both hands

the filling was good though they did hold up a bit on the guacamole but as it was late night I couldn't be bothered. I had the butter chicken. It's on the more expensive side after all it came down to 11 something

The only down side I can say it there drinks are expensive and the people who serve talk quietly I had trouble hearing when the server was asking me for a what type of sauce I wanted but they kept there cool and I was keen to tip well for there troubles.

If you want to dine in there's a outdoor patio clean and we'll kept. Only down side to it is that it can feel a but crowded due to the lack of space and there's no napkins or garbage bins outside"}
{"text":"Not bad but just average. The chicken in the burrito is extremely dry so opt for one with a sauce."}
{"text":"I figured I'd give this place a try.  I had heard alot about the Fat Bastards in the burbs, and that they have different flavours than Burrito Boyz.  I order a LIL butter chicken with everything except green onions.

I was disappointed to say the least.  I wish I had gone to Burrito Boyz.  So much regret.

SERVICE:  I had ordered via a mobile app, that said it had been received and I was FIRST in line.  But, when I came to pick it up 12 min later they had not even started my burrito.  The manager apologized saying there was \"something wrong with the system\", but I clearly saw my printed out chit SITTING on a tray for awhile not being made.  They even made burritos of people who were in the process of ordering at the cash register first.  The whole point of pre-ordering is NOT waiting.  There was maybe 9 ppl in the store.  4 already eating.  3 of us waiting for online orders.  1 waiting from cash.  1 person ordering.  Fine.  Maybe they are not very good at multitasking. (but, I point out when I passed by Burrito Boyz on my way there they had about 30-40 ppl there, and I have never had to wait if I pre-ordered.) 1*

FOOD:  The LIL chicken burrito is more expensive than BB's small chicken burrito by $2. The same price as a haddock or calamari burrito.  However, it is actually smaller and lighter.  They made my burrito, and placed it on the grill.  Not even 2 min later, she gave it to me.  The \"butter chicken\" isnt stewed with the sauce like at east indian roti places.  The white chunks of pre-cooked chicken are placed on your veg, then a tiny squirt of butter chicken sauce is squeezed on top.  The tortilla shell was warmish, insides were cold, the chicken was lukewarm.  I really hope I do not get sick from this.  For the extra $2, I didn't taste a hint of butter chicken.  Maybe, a whisper of it? 2*

I will not be going back.  I will stick to BB.  If I want burritos with marinated and stewed meats on the inside, I suggest people try Bolet's."}
{"text":"I used to order from here at least once a week with my boyfriend. I will never eat here again.  We placed an order that we always order, whole wheat, one big one small, small no noodles or rice.  He picked up our order and sure enough mine was white flour (I cannot eat white flour).  This happens ALL THE TIME so I just usually eat the insides.  Sure enough there were noodles in mine, ugh.  I went to trade with my boyfriend but he had rice in his and no noodles.  Completely wrong order.  We call to get a new burrito delivered to us, which isn't a stretch seeing as we LIVE NEXT DOOR. What a horrible idea. We called three times after waiting over an hour.  Then they stopped taking my calls.  Then we waited almost another hour.  I waited for almost TWO HOURS for my dinner.  It ruined my night, I didnt eat the damn thing thwy brought I was so pissed off and will never eat there again.   Don't waste your time with these guys if you want your order right, and definitely don't attempt delivery if you actually want to eat your meal."}
{"text":"This was the worst burrito experience ever. I have tried burrito boyz,  Mucho burrito and chipotle. So I thought I would give fat bastard burrito a try. Since I am on a keto diet I usually order a chicken burrito bowl this was by far the worst I have ever eaten. No grilled veggies, Cheap shredded watery lettuce, runny salsa, watery sour cream, I paid for extra cheese and extra guac and I didn't appear like I got extra of anything. I had to ask 3 and 4 times for extra stuff, they barely put anything that you ask for. However the thin that takes the cake....their \"grilled chicken\" is the water packed canned chicken you can buy at Costco ( but worse). It was watery and it smelled like that canned chicken . It wasn't seasoned and had no flavor . It was an epic fail of a meal . I never write reviews but I felt so strongly about how poor the quality of food was along with the poor service of the girl that made my burrito bowl it was  a fail on every level. Be warned save your money anything is better than this slop. It was disgusting. I couldn't eat it i through it out. Best burrito bowl hands down is chipotle they use quality ingredients and the service I've experienced at multiple locations has been great. I would give fat bastard on Queensway negative stars if I could."}
{"text":"I had the best meal the other day! Felt like a genuine fat bastard for a couple hours afterwards too! ;)"}
{"text":"So I certainly eat my fair share of burritos and Mexican food. I have found myself in positions where I'm in need of a burrito and due to a lack of time and nearby fast burritos, I enter fat bastard.  

I do find that fat bastard has some similarities to burrito boyz, but still it's just not that good. The meat is not very good. The steak is not steak? It's like microwaved beef. Everything else in the burrito is cold so I mean all that time flipping the burrito with bare hands goes to waste. 

Also not sure why they insist on using bare hands to rolls and flip the burrito? Like seriously this isn't rocket science. Sandwich artists at subway have found a way. They also make you pay extra for them to put sauce on the burrito and pretend it's some new special burrito. 

I would suggest everyone stay away from the lousy burritos spots so we can get something good in LV. Chipotle ? Heck mucho burrito is ten times better. Give me a burrito that is hot. If you're desperate for a burrito it'll get the job done. But when you start asking them to not grill it so you can avoid their hands all over your burrito and get your own hot sauces you realize you should just stop going.

Overall score: 1.2"}
{"text":"Poor Service. Expensive and I got a curly black hair for a door prize."}
{"text":"Nothing like a good burrito after a ball-game or night out! And there is no other Burrito like a Fattie.

The selection is what brings you here. Curry, Shrimp, noodles instead of rice, much mlre interesting than Burrito Boyz."}
{"text":"I've been to a couple of different locations of FBB, and most of the time I'm relatively happy with what I get. But after this same amount of visits, I realize that I'm never really craving a meal from this chain, and so although I'm sure I'll still drop by every once in a while, I don't think they'll ever get to where I think I'll be a regular. 
This past time I had the Baha Chipotile Chicken Burrito. I just got the \"L'il\" size, and that was plenty of food. It was relatively tasty, which I guess was pretty easy, as I added pretty much everything they had to offer in terms of toppings and sauces. The one problem I had: and this wasn't the first time, is that the meat I got on my burrito was very over cooked, and really dry. I got the breaded chicken chunks this time, and they were fried within an inch of their lives. I didn't break a tooth or anything, but I was a little afraid I would. 
I went around lunch time, and the place was really busy. This didn't seem to phase the staff at all though, and they all were working furiously making sure that nobody had to wait too long. I was actually pretty impressed with how quickly my lunch was ready for me."}
{"text":"This place did not disappoint! They have a large variety of burritos and quesadillas to choose from with great fillings. I had the roasted steak burrito. The steak was cooked perfectly, and tasted great with the fillings I chose. The restaurant is clean and the atmosphere was welcoming and friendly. The employees were really nice. There's nothing that was bad about this place. If you're looking for somewhere to go for a quick lunch, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Huge portions, great service and selection.  I've been to a few of their locations and have never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"It takes 2.5 hours for a delivery more often then not. I ordered two burritos at 7:15 last night and didn't get them until after 9:30. When I called on the status of my order, it was like pulling teeth. The girl on the phone was no help whatsoever and didn't seem to think that over two hours for two burritos was an issue. No apology or explanation was given. There are better burrito spots more deserving of your money. Don't waste it on this bastard!"}
{"text":"We stopped by at about 1 am on a Thursday after just getting into town. We hadn't eaten in hours and needed food. The staff was rude and treated us like we were dummies for not knowing exactly what we wanted. They kept questioning us based on our order. It was so bizarre. Our group assumes they only get regulars and that's why we had the experience we had. At any rate, the food was also not good. The chips and guac comes with the tiniest side of guac. I wouldn't recommend getting it. The other three in my group didn't like their burritos either. Note to the wise- they heat the whole burrito after you put your food choices on it. So don't order sour cream and guac if you don't want them warm. Long story short- there are better options in the area."}
{"text":"Best Burrito Ever!

Mr. H has tried to make me have burritos for a while now. He made me try it at one of the poplar US chain and I never liked it. One day i see him eating a burrito from here and he asked me to try it, he said he got the hot sauce by mistake. One bite and I was hooked, I loved the taste of the burrito along with the hot sauce. The taste was very unique. Next time I go get myself a Tequila Lime Chicken and it was good, next I try the Yam, it was good, next the Fish, it was awesome and so was the shrimp! Everything that I tried was awesome!

My favourite however remains the Fish, their condiments taste very good (rice, beans, guacamole, peppers, etc). The service here is good and the people behind the counter are quick and always have a smile to offer. 

It's now my favourite spot for a quick stomach filling treat!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent for a Chipotle like burrito. I had the chicken burrito medium size. It was quite good, similar to Chipotle in size and taste.. takes a little longer to make compared to the competition but definitely comparable or better.

Only major negatives are this location seems to have very limited seating..only 4 chairs.. so only good if you want to get take out."}
{"text":"I did not appreciate being argued with over guacamole, after being made to pay for my burrito first, and then being told that they charge extra for guac on a veggie burrito in which they took a butter knife and spread a tiny amount of guac on. Apparently \"guac is expensive\" (like a paying customer needs to hear of your financial woes) and \"Mucho Burrito charges extra for guac too!\". LOL Just to set the record straight, I have an unhealthy addiction to Mucho Burrito's veggie burritos (at least once a week) and I NEVER pay for extra guac because they put an ICE CREAM SCOOP on top of the veggie burritos, NO CHARGE. I also lived beside Chipotle in Toronto for many years and that was the same case when I would frequent there for with veggie bowls and burritos. I should also mention that the girl at the front counter needed to be hung upside down to see a smile come out of her. Although they offer a good burrito, this left a sour taste in my mouth and I will not go back. Sad...I was really excited to check this place out and become a regular..."}
{"text":"I liked it. Since i'm a burrito person, I can say that this place is good, the only thing that bothers me is that the burritos are a little pricey and I just wish they had more topping options. Overall I'd come back and get one."}
{"text":"I used to really enjoy this location, however i think they've gotten new owners. They now give the smallest portions, and they didnt even have the burrito sauce when i went. Either make sure you pretty much ask for more of each item or you will end up with the smallest burrito ever."}
{"text":"This is the stuff you eat when you're smashed out of your mind, you've just stumbled out of the club, and your head is spinning. In the distance, you see a bright sign that says Fat Bastard Burrito. In your screwed up state of mind, you walk in, fork over the $12 for a huge, and devour the most delicious confection ever created on this earth. Of course, this is only true when you're hammered. Sober, it's still pretty good. However, alcohol before is strongly encouraged."}
{"text":"Had the bean and cheese burrito the other day.  Beans a bit bland, cheese seemed like it was out of one of those plastic \"Tex-Mex\" mix bags you get at the Price Chopper.  I don't know if it's their intention, but does the burrito have to be so cold?  I didn't sense any warmth from the bag as I walked out, and 3 minutes later at home when I took a bite it actually seemed like I had just taken it out of the fridge.  The burrito was saved by the sauces having good flavor, fresh cilantro, and the assorted veggies."}
{"text":"Longest wait time EVER. Took me 30 mins to get my little fish burrito. If you have spare time then by all means then come here but if you're in a hurry and want to walk in and walk out.. don't bother. The staff were not efficient. Never coming here again."}
{"text":"I was very lazy and instead of one walking more block to Burrito Boys, I decided to try Fat Bastard. The service was mediocre, but the price was comparable to other burrito joints. I ordered the ground beef burrito and it was just meh. The burrito was quite mushy and did not have much flavour. The one pro was that it comes with guacamole for no additional cost."}
{"text":"I LOVE THEIR BURRITO SAUCE. Absolutely obsessed. I'm a little weirded out by the noodle option, but to each their own. The staff is fast and the burritos are yummy. Also, great deep fried Mars bar."}
{"text":"My fav burrito place. I always get the sweet potato with everything including chips and noodles.

Sometimes the service can be a bit spotty. Sometimes my order is either wrong, they don't put all the toppings when I ask for it, they load on the hot sauce when I ask for mild, or they skimp out on toppings. One girl put 3.. THREE pieces of green pepper. Then she removed one. I ordered a medium sized burrito and ended up smaller than their 'lil' (what I usually order.)

The burritos do take a bit of time but can be ordered in advance.

I do go to burrito boyz and big fat burrito pretty often  (burritos are bomb diggity ok, dont judge) and I find this place is way more consistent in terms of quality than both. Also addition of nachos and noodles as toppings at no extra charge is what really sells this place to me."}
{"text":"I am a burrito connoisseur, and know the places around the city pretty well. I have had good experiences at OTHER Fat Bastards but I'm forced to this location by convenience. 

The staff are abrupt and simply unfriendly, they always seem like they would literally be anywhere else. The preparation is flagrantly half-assed, they put tons of lettuce and little else in the way of toppings. 

This is not a reflection of a single experience, but multiple visits. 

Will make an effort to AVOID this location in the future. Too many other, better options."}
{"text":"Excellent Burrito's, friendly staff, and good prices.

The tequila Lime Chicken is great, and the Blair's Chips are to die for...

I'll definately be back."}
{"text":"I love Fat Bastards but this location was not as good as the others.  The person making my burrito was going too fast even though there was nobody else ordering food.  The chicken burrito was also smaller than the usual size I get from other locations.  I'll probably try this location again to see if the quality changed."}
{"text":"Amazing service! The Howard Stern looking dude was super nice and gave us free churro chips. They were really fast, all smiles, and made a great tasting burrito! We'll be coming back again for sure!"}
{"text":"The yam burrito is an awesome option for vegetarians tired of bean & cheese and soy meat burritos. One of my favourite foods. All the burritos are giant; good value. They have non-standard options like noodles instead of rice. The rice to other stuff ratio is good, you don't get a bunch of filler. Surprised the average star rating isn't higher!"}
{"text":"Move over Burrito Boyz, I've got a new favourite burrito place!

Let me start off by professing that I am a burrito veteran. Without exaggeration, I've probably had over 100 burritos from Burrito Boyz (I worked right across the street from the Peter St. location when it existed) as well as several other establishments across Toronto and a few in the US.

My foodie coworkers and I all noticed the decline of flavour from Burrito Boyz over the years until it reached a point where we now find them downright bland. I claim that it's their hot sauce that's changed as well as their meat seasoning.

Enough BB bashing.

Well I stopped into Fat Bastard for a change. And a change is what I received! I ordered the ground beef burrito (not available at BB) with all the fixins including crushed tortilla chips, singapore noodles and ghost pepper sauce!

Freaking delicious! And I HAD to buy some Blair's Death Rain chips and some dried ghost peppers while I was there.

I'll be back. Soon. My mouth is starting to cool down."}
{"text":"Consistently good. I go here at least once a week. I have yet to be disappointed. Lots of options. They've made a science of getting people served quickly and well."}
{"text":"Sweet chili Thai burritos are to die for! For the price of 7.99 you got yourself a huge portion. The place is pretty small to dine but however the food is really good."}
{"text":"I have never see a skinnier burrito. They literally put two pieces of green onion! Really regretting eating here. Please do yourself a favor and eat at burrito boyz."}
{"text":"This place was disgusting. The worst 'taco' I've ever had in my life. An insult to the name taco. I felt like I had a pile of small open burritos that were made out back in a dumpster and had some BBQ slopped on top. I specifically said 'no fusion business' on my tacos and they still befouled them with BBQ. Why. What the yuck. Some weird actin employees too. Creepy vibe."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with this place. It took me 25 mins to other and get my burrito, so much for fast food. However, considering I have worked in the industry myself, I don't think too much of the wait, these things happen. What I was really disappointed with was my burrito, it was half the size in regards to what you'd normally get. It wasn't even filmed enough! I was starving after I finished it :("}
{"text":"This chain has a great menu unfortunately this location has a bad reputation so far in the area. My boyfriend ordered a steak burrito and was given a pulled pork burrito that was cold. I ordered the buffalo chicken and there was a lack of consistency with ingredients."}
{"text":"We ordered a red ale kettle fire chicken burrito and veggie burrito. Both were delicious and the special hot sauce was extremely spicy. That's what made it more fantastic, great fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"This place is a staggering OK. Don't get me wrong, the food is very good. It's everything else that's lacking: the customer service is not good, the wait times are awful (regardless of how busy it is) and the prices are a bit steep.

The last time I went there I asked for a very small amount of jalapenos (my exact words). As the place is tiny and was packed I couldn't actually get to the glass to see what was happening. When I got home I figured out rather quickly that my burrito was,  with no exaggeration, almost half jalapenos. They decided to skimp out on everything (including the meat) and load up on the spicy stuff that I didn't want. Suffice it to say, I did not eat it."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, the portions are great and most of the ingredients seem fresh. I love their baked chicken and get extra burrito sauce + a touch of the hot sauce. Last time I was there, I tried the \"butter chicken\". I know I shouldn't have had any high expectations but it was disappointing. I'll continue to stick with the plain baked chicken. 
They also do a good \"burrito in a bowl\", and I always ask for extra lettuce/veggies because they can be skimpy."}
{"text":"Awful!

Never again. Ordered 2 \"small\" steak burritos which came to nearly $20.00? Really? Tasted worse than something frozen out of the supermarket. No flavor, very bland, tasteless and rude customer service. Fail!!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Still Burrito Boyz is the place to be.  Fat Bastard is decent but wasn't on par with Burrito Boyz in terms of price and taste.  I like how the Guac is included in the price.  They have 3 sizes here lil, big and huge.  They have a bunch of specialties flavors for $1 more than the classic.  I got the Huge Roasted Steak came to around $14 after tax. Workers were friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I don't often get food on campus but was caught between two meetings and was desperate. This place is terrible! The service is pretty bad; inattentive, attitudey, and slow. Once they throw all the ingredients onto your wrap in a mad dash the service then slows before you actually get your burrito. And the taste? Pass. The baked chicken was so mush and bland. None of the 4 or 5 sauces she added provided any flavour at all. Very few veggies were present nor was there any freshness or texture. Just blah, not worth it for $10. I wouldn't go here again."}
{"text":"It's a good Burrito joint, better than most...but it's no Burrito Boyz. 

I've enjoyed Fat Bastard's numerous times, tasty burritos for sure.  They have a pretty good variety of burritos and I think the have a weekly of monthly special too.  

What keeps them from 5 stars?  Coming from BB, the quality at FB isn't up there.  The steak and shrimp is better at BB.  The burritos at FB aren't wrapped tight enough sometimes.  And it's more expensive than BB. 

It's still better than Big Fat Burrito, Chino Locos, Chipotle.  2nd place is something to be proud of!"}
{"text":"I usually go to Burrito Boys across the street on the Queensway on the advice of a co-worker, but I found Fat Bastard Burrito quite good. The variety of their toppings seemed like a nice change for me and as well the menu was clearly more extensive. They even have a kind of spaghetti as well as tortilla chips as toppings which is interesting. Once, for a ground beef version, I let them fill it up with 'everything' and I was surprised at how good it was.
Service was quick with no messing around and I liked that there are 3 different sizes of burrito available. They also have Mexican Coke but it is priced high at $4.50."}
{"text":"I was very annoyed with my experience at this location today. It seemed like 2/3 of the employees were either new or just totally incompetent. First of all, while it's great that the guacamole is free, the insanely small amount put on my burrito was laughable. I asked for a little more and got exactly that. 
After my burrito and naked burrito were ready, the two employees decided they should start preparing my order of chips and guacamole. This began with a five minute discussion between them regarding the container size they should use for the guacamole. When that was decided, one employee went over to get the chips. After a few minutes and a few different method trials, she finally asked her manager how to get the chips in the bag. Once he completed this challenging task, a few minutes later we finally got our full order. Including the burritos that had been sitting getting cold during the chip situation. 
I was not in a rush but it was very frustrating watching all this happen. We were the only customers in the restaurant and they weren't completing any online orders either. 
The burritos were okay, nothing amazing. Not many vegan options and I'm still not sure if the guacamole is vegan, after messaging the facebook and twitter pages with no response."}
{"text":"Fairy busy around lunch time. Pulled pork tastes great while the chicken is terrible. 

Pros:
- Good service 
- Tastey food 
- Decently priced 

Cons:
- chicken tastes terrible"}

{"text":"My wife and I had a veggie burrito here yesterday for a quick lunch, and it was delicious! Staff seemed pretty friendly, too. We'll be back again with our son."}
{"text":"Wasn't the greatest burrito although the one on Dixie in mississuaga is phenomenal. The burrito split open after the first bite \"had to finish it with a fork\" the service wasn't the greatest. I would just never ever go back to this location."}
{"text":"I got to drop it to two stars and I got to say I am really disappointed, but they have potential. The ingredients are great the décor is nice. They just keep dropping the ball. Tonight,  my third time since they opened took almost 30 minutes to get a burrito with only one person ahead of me. The cook was just too busy doing everything but his job and seemed to be more interested in getting his clean up done so he can get out early. Burritos were stacking up to be rolled and he is washing the floor an hour before closing. I was getting so frustrated waiting while my food sat opened and sitting.  I think the staff needs a lot more training and supervision. Again my burrito was cold on the inside. This bothers me because any bacteria will flourish at room temperature and remain if not hot enough. I wont be back to this location for a while.

Carols review clearly looks like a fake... she lives in Halton Hills  seems to know their busy times etc... it has only  been open a few days, how can someone so far away know so much. BUSTED! I don't respect this place for allowing this kind of review, for this reason, I wont be back."}
{"text":"Sometimes I give in to my craving and get a burrito from Fat Bastard. Usually it does the job (not in the way Chipotle does, but then again who can beat Chipotle?). Coming to this location, though, was the worst decision I've ever made. Sure the burrito tasted similar to how it usually does at other locations, but the staff made the entire experience cringe-worthy. First, they messed up our burrito order by using a whole wheat tortilla instead of white tortilla. Totally fine, mistakes happen. But when we told them we didn't want a whole wheat tortilla, they insisted on simply transferring the contents of the burrito from one tortilla to another. Um, hello? No! Just make us a new burrito - it doesn't cost you much to do so! Then, when we were eating the burrito I found that a lot of the noodles were uncooked and felt like sharp pieces of plastic in my mouth. Nice. That was just the cherry on top for me - never returning to this location again!"}
{"text":"Wanted to grab a quick bite. We went in and we got the three chicken tacos. The chicken was dry but the sauce thAt was on the tacos was pretty good. It was a good taco but not a great taco or the best taco. I probably wouldn't stop back there again but if u want a quick bite and it have to wait then stop in there grab a taco or burrito but if you are looking for an amazingly delicious mouth watering taco or burrito then you might be slightly disappointed unless your starving.. then at that point anything would taste amazing !"}
{"text":"I love my burritos, so i might have some bias, but i'm not a picky eater. 
The guys that work here are always the best, sometimes theres a longer waiting time if there's more people but it doesn't bother me. Their burrito's are pretty large, and I love that they add in noodles into the burritos, something I haven't seen before. Although, they're burrito's get so juicy it gets everything soaked at the bottom that It gets so messy, but it doesn't bother me since I enjoy the taste! Close to where Im at so it's a go to. The medium size called big is the one I always get, usually rounds up to $11.00. 
If you're craving something, this place won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Great for a grab and go burrito. Prices are fair and service is quick and friendly. My fave is the pulled pork, but they do have vegi options too. I love the sliding door for the opening it makes the space feel bigger and open, very funky."}
{"text":"Very good service first of all, cannot say anything bad about the people that work here, they are beautiful people.
I cannot believe it myself, but this was our first time at this chain. Interior is simple, black, nice. High chairs and high tables make up the seating area. 
We got tacos and two naked burritos. The chicken was very dry on one of the naked burritos. The pulled pork was allright, nothing special. The ground beef taco (soft) was the best part of the meal.
The toppings were not fresh. 
We will give it another try."}
{"text":"I will have to give this place pretty good marks for effort and for quality of the food.   

The apparance of the store is inviting, trendy, yet low key. The servers were polite and busy... They appeared to be working hard.      The qualty of the food ingredients is generally fresh and of good quality.  The form of burrito is unpretentious, however its size was generous and it was very tasty.  

The only issue I might raise with the store is that there is not a lot of space to hard around and eat.  This is ok if you just want to take it out.    

At the prices they charge, Fat Bastard is good value for the money."}
{"text":"Unappetizing Taco served very cold (Not a room temperature actually cold to touch)  , was told this is the way it is being served at fat bastard burrito.
I would say the worst taco I ever had, and I had lots of fish tacos."}
{"text":"For someone living in the area, it is my go to meal for when I'm too lazy/busy to cook. Not the cheapest or healthiest, but it does fill you up. The service is not the fastest, but the workers are fairly pleasant. I would recommend it for a quick lunch/dinner if you live at CityPlace."}
{"text":"Ordered a chicken naked burrito through uber eats. Not only does the chicken taste bland but they managed to forget to put lettuce in. Not happy."}
{"text":"My second experience as just as good as the first!! great burritos!!!"}
{"text":"Went over to Fat Bastard Burritos on a whim, as it was late night and the lineup at Johnny's Hamburgers was ridiculous. Good ol' Yelp App told me that this place was open late and to be quite honest, I didn't feel like eating a burger and fries.

I'm so glad that I came here! 

I agree with the price point of the food and was even more excited that I could get my steak burrito \"naked\" as a rice dish instead of with a tortilla. So filling and satisfying. As well, they sell imported Coca-Cola from Mexico, which is not as harsh as the kind we are sold here. Nice little touch. Loved it so much, bought extras for home."}
{"text":"Had the naked steak burrito for lunch. I'll give them the 5 stars since it was as consistent as the great one I had at the Victoria Park location. 

Satisfied!"}
{"text":"Ordered my food. Stood and waited for 10 minutes while I watched them struggle with a couple of Uber eats orders.  Mine wasn't even started. Asked for my money back and left.  Went next door to Philthy Phillys.  Was great. So was the service!"}
{"text":"I'm updating my review simply because this place is beginning to disappoint. The burrito itself is smaller, the amount of protein they give you has significantly decreased and the place is not as neat and tidy.  If you ask for extra guacamole they look at you like you're crazy. I'm a regular there but I'm now looking for another burrito spot."}
{"text":"We kept thinking we needed to give them another try as we were very loyal in the beginning but why.....I'm not sure!  We are officially DONE with FBB!  Save your energy AND keep your stress level down and stroll across the street!  These people are hopeless!  If you want your order screwed up EVERY TIME, then this is the place for you!!!  I am not sure why Burrito Boyz has these people HANDS DOWN but i suspect it's just caring a little about what your quality and customer service is like!  We called in an order on our LAST attempt at try FBB and by the time we got there, they hadn't even started the order!  USELESS USELESS USELESS.....Worst convo with the \"owner\" and he doesn't give a sh** either!  BUHBYE!!!!"}
{"text":"I've thought about writing this review so many times, I thought I already wrote it. The burritos are alright. There are a lot of ingredients (they aren't all great though) to choose from. I've gotten the baked chicken and butter chicken, and one time they had the baked chicken but fried, and I tried it like that. I should mention I came back several times because there wasn't much for me to choose from in the area, but I stopped coming because I never get heartburn, like ever, but these burritos gave me heartburn. The baked chicken is decent, but its fried version is awful. The meat was so deep fried that I wouldn't have been able to tell if they gave me fried shrimp or fried chicken (I actually contemplated this while eating it because it was so fried it didn't even taste like chicken). Overall, I think it comes down to the quality of the ingredients, which is poor."}
{"text":"Just got take out from here!  Wanted to go back for ages since I had the fish taco (delicious)!  Really disappointed with the ground beef burrito!  It tasted like boiled beef!  I was waiting to hear the sizzle on the flat top but to no avail!  My 10yr old also had it and said he would take Burrito Boys across the road over this hands down!  We both only ate a third of the \"lil\" size.

My husband had the Tequila Lime crispy chicken and he loved it!  I had a bite and agreed very good!

Hot sauce is super hot and I only asked for mild!  Love the heat though!

Giving it a 3 star only based on the law of averages!  Won't rush back.

Staff very pleasant tho!"}
{"text":"Unbelievably rude staff. I felt unwanted the entire time I was there. The cashier rolled her eyes at me and sighed after I asked her for a plastic bag. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"The portions are tiny. They totally skimp out on the ingredients and give you attitude about it. I got a thimbleful of guacamole and then when I explained that I'd paid for extra, I got half a thimbleful more. I had to ask her to put beans on the second half as well. Then it tasted bad too. What a disappointment!"}
{"text":"I've been having hankerings for Mexican for the last year after touring a few cities in the US for work and having great Mexican options while down there.

I've never known Toronto to have many Mexican options so I've been hard pressed to fulfil my cravings.

It's unfortunate that I have to report that Fat Bastards was quite a letdown. Burritos and other 
\"standard\" Mexican fair are not difficult dishes to get right but somehow Fat Bastards produced really below par food. It's been quite a while since I've been as disappointed in a meal as I was the one time I tried this place a few months ago. 

Spare yourself the letdown and find another option."}
{"text":"I usually love Fat Bastard Burrito the locations on College and King St are great! Last night after some drinks my friends and I went for a burrito they wanted to head straight for Burrito Boys and I wish I had let them, instead I convinced everyone to stop here. Big mistake. Terrible protein sizes, and the dude making the wraps was SOOOO stingy with the ingredients I ended up eating a rice and lettuce wrap with a couple shrimp tossed in for fun. 

Next time I will make the right choice and skip this location."}
{"text":"sickness has never been a problem for me here. i am a huge naked yam burrito fan (HUGE FAN) and i find that sadly the bowls i receive here lack that thick delicious yam i am looking to pay $10 for. instead i tend to receive around 5 thin slices of sad oily fried potato *frowns*. also good to note there is  not a lot of seating in store. other than that, the food is satisfying more of the time, the service and portion sizes are good. usually my go to if nothing familiar in the same genre is around."}
{"text":"I'm all about service. I had the naked fish burrito and it was really tasty. I don't feel gross and the hot sauce was house made and fresh. The owner even came to ask is what they could do better and that impressed me, someone willing to ask their customers their thoughts is worth the visit. There 3 of us and we all enjoyed our meals. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I liked the size of the burrito (ordered a large), however, chow mein was used as a filler in burrito which is interesting but the burrito didnt taste authentic. the filling in the burrito was on the colder side. the service was kind though"}
{"text":"My diet had withered me to a hungry shell of a man, so to provide some much needed relief I decided to try out Fat Bastard Burrito Co on Queen St. This location is essentially purely takeout, since there isn't much seating to speak of. Aside from that, the only other thing to note aesthetically is the button activated sliding front door which just seemed... odd for a burrito joint. Needless detail? Yes.

The food! It was pretty damn good. I opted for the baked chicken burrito, which I'll say right off the bat was good, but if you're looking to maximize your tasty, go for the ground beef or pulled pork. Anyway, the name Fat Bastard Burrito is warranted, because these bad boys are thick and filling. I got a \"lil\" size and was still healthily satisfied by its conclusion. They stuff the burritos with everything but the kitchen sink: beans, rice, lettuce, cheese, pico de gallo, cilantro, green onions, sweet peppers, jalapenos, mild salsa, coleslaw, sour cream, burrito sauce, hot sauce, guacamole, burrito spice, chicken. Of note, the chicken was cooked well, but it didn't have much seasoning, if any, which I suppose they can pass without considering the myriad of other ingredients, but what can I say; the heart wants what the heart wants. Lastly, I really appreciated how when I asked for spicy, they treated me like an adult and gave me bonafide spicy.

To sum it up, it was obviously very good. You'll find better elsewhere, but for a \"fast food\" burrito, the ingredients are solid, it leaves you satiated, and the taste is real. Come through."}
{"text":"Great late night spot. The food is delicious and the people watching is even better (queen street location)"}
{"text":"The giant is HUGE. The naked bowls are delicious! The battered chicken is BAD, overly deep fried garbage, avoid! Get steak, grilled chicken, bean and cheese, really anything that isn't battered and deep fried.
Delivery usually takes forever. And be warned - the hot sauce is HOT. I love spicy food, but the hot sauce here renders the meal inedible for me. Unless you like ghost pepper type of spicy, skip it! Extra guac is totally worth the $1! :)"}
{"text":"I didn't enjoy the burrito here. I got to pulled pork burrito and it lacked flavour. The meat wasn't great. They do have a nice selection of toppings. The are also pretty quick. Maybe the other options are better. Overall, I wasn't impressed and I won't be back here in a hurry.

I still love Chiptole's more."}
{"text":"Out of the ten times I've been there only four would have been decent experiences. The staff is really friendly and will always try to speed things up for you, however those other six times my order has been wrong. Today was the last time. Too bad."}
{"text":"Big, inexpensive burritos. Pretty tasty. Gluten free options available, but celiacs beware, they don't seperate foods so there is cross contamination. Lots of parking, usually doesn't take too long. Good place for intoxicated patrons to fill up."}
{"text":"Wasn't the biggest fan.

 I got the organic tofu, on brown wrap with veggies, guac, and the burrito sauce. It tasted very plain. I feel they didn't put enough sauce, or any other flavours for that matter. The ingredients tasted fresh atleast. The portion was also very large and worth its money. 

My order also took longer than expected. Staff was nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Fat Bastard is a great place for a burrito but not so much for a bowl. I always get a ground beef burrito here, be careful of the sizes because their Large is called a Huge and trust me it's massive! I stick with the big ground beef. They have fresh ingredients and are quick to order, I also recommend any of their fish options. They also get an extra star for FREE GUAC! 

If you're looking for a good burrito even late night, this is your spot"}
{"text":"Probably 3.5 stars. I've rated Burrito Boyz 3 as well, and though FBB deserves better, it is a bit of a stretch to give it a 4.

Ultimately, they have a lot of toppings to choose from, and similar to what you'll find at many burrito places. What will help set places apart is the meat quality and seasoning. In that regard, FB does pretty well, and the chilli-lime chicken I had was quite good. I also like that they don't charge for guac. All the other ingredients were fresh and some items such as the rice being better than BB.

One thing that held them back was that their hot sauce is quite sweet which isn't really my thing. I tried a sample before they put it on. Though I could taste the sweetness on the sample, it was that much more apparent once it was on throughout the burrito. It wasn't too bad, but it did pull the experience back a little. I also tried some of the salsa with chips, and the salsa was a bit disappointing too - being fairly sweet and Americanised.

A pretty good place that is probably a reliable option, but could improve - even if it was the hot sauce alone. Might seem like a small detail, but it's an important one when you're talking about burritos."}
{"text":"I had a naked burrito with the pulled pork and baked chicken.   The burrito was pretty delicious; it had lots of flavours going on and was perfectly spiced.  The guacamole is really good here - not as sour cream laden as the one at Burrito Boyz.  While the place is a bit small and cramped with customers, they were pretty quick with the orders.  I ate in my car due to their only being one area along the window to sit.  Would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Got a Big Ground Beef Classic Burrito. Was my first time trying it. The size was great, only had 2/3. The veggies were fresh and the sauces were amazing. My new burrito place to go. Maybe i will try one of the fusion burritos next time. Lets see..."}
{"text":"Pretty awesome burrito! We got the roasted steak burrito and battered fish burrito. Great taste and well sized, although I wished they had regular steak as well instead of just roasted steak as an option. My all time favorite burrito joint has always been Burrito Boyz and this place is pretty damn close in comparison."}
{"text":"Ate fish burrito. 10$ 
No better nor worse than any other burrito place. 
Guac included."}
{"text":"I have had more negative experiences at this location than positive ones. Today I had to wait over 20 minutes for a small burrito, burrito bowl, and chips with guacamole. They had been open for over an hour, had 3 people working, and no other customers in store, so it's annoying that it took that long. It took one employee almost 5 minutes to decide which container to put the guacamole in and it took the other one over 5 minutes to get the chips in the bag and put our order together. Another time a totally different set of employees took over 20 minutes to make one tofu bowl. After I had already paid for my order they then decided to tell me they had no tofu ready, only frozen, and asked if I wanted anything else instead. I said I would be happy to wait for them to get tofu prepared or I'd take a refund, but the employee seemed pretty adamant that I should just pick something else. After a 5 minute discussion he finally decided that he'd be able to get some tofu ready so I came back about 15 minutes later and it was ready. It was just inconvenient to have that conversation when he could've just gotten the tofu ready, and even more inconvenient that they'd let me order and pay before telling me they didn't have tofu readily available. I'm very discouraged with this location because the food is usually pretty decent but the staff is usually pretty incompetent. 

Short version: I wouldn't recommend coming here if you're looking for speedy service, but the food is still pretty good if you're not in a rush."}
{"text":"Best fast food burrito I've had. So huge and full of flavour and they've always been hot off the presses. If you're hungry, get at this place. Best fat bastard I've ever had. Nom. Nom. Nom."}
{"text":"They got Massive burritos! Great alternative to Burrito Boyz, and different flavours. If you need something to really hit the spot, their 2 pound burritos will do the job!"}
{"text":"Good prices! I highly recommend this restaurant for company catering. Everyone in our group lived their burritos. I had a vegan one with sautéed veggies and rice and beans. It was awesome! My friends say the churro chips are a must."}
{"text":"Unbelievably small portions and crappy service. Why they think their burritos are big is beyond me. For the money paid for a veggie burrito, I could have eaten anywhere else and actually been full. Will never go here again."}
{"text":"Oh my god this was the worst! ordered the lil naked yam. I got about 4 paper thin discs of Yam...on a bed of NOODLES...with no actual  vegetables. they don't even have corn. 
this was the worst burrito I have ever had. service was dismal bordering non existent."}
{"text":"We had the best burritos here and had the best service. The girl serving us on a busy Sunday afternoon was bubbly and nice. She made sure I  knew the hot sauce was pretty hot and when I said \"just a bit\" she made sure I got the perfect amount.

Fast and efficient and delicious. Also, large portions!"}
{"text":"This store doesn't know how to make a burrito.
My dinner looked like it was minced in a blender.
Don't waste your money. The owner needs some
lessons on how to make a burrito. My looked like it
was put in a blender."}
{"text":"This was my first experience at Fat Bastard, and I was very happy with the service and food. The menu is limited to burritos, quesadillas, and sides. I ordered a Huge chicken burrito to share, and chips and salsa. The toppings were plentiful, from beans to rice to guacamole to pico de gallo, and everything seemed quite fresh, and the chicken were large, tender, white meat pieces. I was very happy with my meal, and the quantity was more than enough for two ladies at lunch. You can eat in, take out, or have the food delivered."}
{"text":"I didn't know a burrito could be so dry. Tasted like a bland desert. Zero of the sauces I ordered were on it. Legit, I had to put my own hot sauce on it. It hurt my soul. I love burritos. Tonight I did not love burritos."}
{"text":"This is always a great experience! I asked for the Thai Chilli Burrito with shrimp instead of the chicken. They made it happen. I got happy about this given that it is called the Thai Chilli Chicken Burrito. The spice level was great and they catered to my pescetarian needs. It's pretty small inside so don't expect to sit really...unless you're ok with high top counter that seats just 4 people."}
{"text":"The worst experience at Fat Bastards happened to me today. I ordered a Lil Naked Shrimp Burrito (Burrito Bowl). I found hair in the burrito bowl and the cashier/worker said the hair could be from MY eyebrow/eyelash. I asked to cook the shrimp a bit more so it's warmer and he tried to teach me how to cook shrimp by taking me into the kitchen, blaming the sauces made the shrimp cold while the shrimp sits on top. The burrito bowl I bought here was much smaller than the one I got downtown Toronto (please see pictures attached in this review). This did not fill me up and I didn't get money's worth and wasn't satisfied with the service. I don't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"The name of the restaurant combined with the creative menu items led me to believe that the food from Fat Bastard Burrito would be quite good, but oh how wrong I was. I carefully made my selection of a naked baja chipotle chicken burrito, getting most of the toppings available. I sat hungrily in my house, patiently waiting for the uber eats delivery to arrive. Arrive it did, and when I opened the box and saw the display, I got my first hint that the food was going to be trash. I took a bite. I didn't like it very much, but thought I would give it another chance so I ate some more. I consumed about a quarter of that salty monstrosity before I decided I should just quit. It was overly-salted and the \"chipotle\" sauce (think sweet barbecue tasting shit) was extremely unnappealing. Due to this experience, I have created a yelp account specifically to give Fat Bastard Burrito the one-star rating it truly deserves."}
{"text":"Convenient location for Cityplace condo dwellers, but pretty skimpy on the portions and the service is relatively slow and impersonal. I've been to a couple Fat Bastard burritos locations before, but for whatever reason this one is lacking to some degree.

The service people are a bit unfriendly and charged my friend and I for the wrong items. When we brought it to their attention, they claimed they didn't know what to do and instead offered us a soda for compensation."}
{"text":"Came here Friday night and fell in love! One reviewer said the burrito sang in his mouth - well let me just say I joined the choir since Friday!

I had the steak burrito with all the works and extra hot sauce and it made my mouth sing like Celine Dion's high notes. The service was super friendly and employees were fun and energetic. The place was clean - the employee was prompt in cleaning the tables after customers left. I watched some raptors on the tv as I ate. It was just an enjoyable, bright ans warm atmosphere and I will definitely hit this place up again!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and awesome service. 

Sumptuous portions. 

Very nice ambiance. 

Not cheap, but good quality food."}
{"text":"Wow, what can I say, such a great menu, friendly staff, and loads of stuff to put on! Amazing Burritos, well priced as well."}
{"text":"Butter chicken burritos, burritos with chow mein, burritos with brandy.  I should end the review there.

2nd best burrito i've ever had.  Good flavour, but their \"big\" isn't as big as other places I've been to.  I think their huge is the equivalent of Boyz large.

Good option in the area but the B-Boyz are still tops in my books"}
{"text":"This place is terrible. The few times that I've gone here I've had to leave before ordering because they're too busy in the back to even acknowledge that I'm there. Today I ordered a small bean and cheese burrito as the only customer in the place. I then waited forever while the two people after me got their burritos first. One customer had to ask for the drink he had already purchased.  A delivery guy came to pick up an order that wasn't ready and then they proceeded to screw that order up. The employees didn't have any care in the world to even be friendly but chatted about their drunk friend. Thanks for wasting 90% of my lunch break, I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I ordered a burrito salad here yesterday expecting a standard bean and cheese, but what I got was just so bad. Why are there noodles in a burrito? And hardly any lettuce? And why are there no jalapeños? Just so many questions. There is no competing with burrito boyz for this place - so disappointed because I know it was founded by a co-founder of burrito boyz. The things that have been done to differentiate are not working in my opinion."}
{"text":"Decided to try this burrito joint because it was the only burritio place that was open on Thanksgiving. It wasn't as good as I expected. Being a Chipotle fan, it didn't even compare to the quality, flavour, and portion especially for the price that was paid. They had 3 diff sizes, we each got a  small size for my boyfriend and I and it came up to $20. Having been to Burrito Boyz, their prices are more reasonable and at least the portions and flavours are better. The good thing is that they offer lots of burrito choices more than your typical steak, chicken or pulled pork. They have featured burritos each day such as Thai Chicken...although im not sure how that would taste in a burrito. I give them credit for friendly service and a clean restaurant."}
{"text":"Great staff and fast service.   Burrito bowls are filled with so many fresh and delicious veggies....  Not much room to sit and eat so take it to-go."}
{"text":"Holy HUGE!  Unless you've got a big appetite, do not face this thing alone.  It is 16\" and a total of 2 Lbs.  I was told about this place from a friend and he said it was better than Burrito Boys.  My girl and I split a roasted chicken - huge.  We got everything except noodles on it (noodles on a burritio? Am I out of the loop?) and we went for the hot.  You may have to wait a bit for the burrito especially if it's busy but it's worth the wait.  
My girlfriend and I are alright with spicy and this sauce, though it did make me sweat, I feel like we could have used a bit more.  That being said, it was incredible and the size was disgustingly big.  If we hadn't have split it I wouldn't have been able to finish it but the beans have a flavor that I'm in love with and the chicken was fresh and juicy.  Do I think it's better than B. Boyz, quite possibly.  Definitely will be back here.  Oh also, seating is limited."}
{"text":"DIARRHEA. How's that for a start? 

Ordered two \"roasted steak\" burritos through Foodora. Delivery service was fine but the food?

-mushy
-watery
-bland
-asked for extra spicy, and what we received wouldnt even classify as mild because it was flavorless 

Both of us has stomach problems and diarrhea as a result. 

Can't speak for other locations, but this one is an absolute embarrassment."}
{"text":"In Heartland Town Centre and were thinking of trying FBB as I knew they had opened a few months ago. 

Just after the lunch hour so it wasn't as busy. The girl quickly took our orders and started to make our burritos. We had a LIl and a Big (small and medium). Both were without dairy and that made them vegan. 

The fillings were plenty, however they seemed a bit under seasoned. The veggie ground available at competitors was sorely missed. The free guacamole was a welcome change. The hot sauce wasn't that hot for me in-spite of having with four lines. The medium was quite filling. The Tofu added was sweet which I personally didn't like. It conflicted I guess with the hot sauce. 

Would definitely go again and try different. The service was great and place clean but at lunch time I guess it's packed."}
{"text":"Amazing burritos, great service and a loyal following are the three trademarks this branch of the Fat Bastard burrito chain have when compared to putter locations. Located across the street from the University of Toronto's main entrance, this restaurant is none for making the best fusion burritos in town. When I say 'fusion' it means that besides traditional burritos, they incorporate different cultural cuisines such as Indian, Jamaican, and Thai classics. Where else can someone find a Butter Chicken, Pad Thai, or Jerk Chicken burritos with your choice of rice or noodle as a filler? Not only are they friggin delicious but extremely sizeable (burritos are available in three sizes) they stand out from their competitors big time!

In addition to an amazing staff and  bustling lunch crowd during weekdays, I've found my new place to go to treat myself whenever I crave Mexican food. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Been twice, out of what I initially wanted each time. Tried the chicken and the pork. Meh... just meh. Price does not match value in my opinion, tasted like grocery store fare. Go to Ravi's just a few storefronts down for a wrap at the same price but twice the flavor. (Even if the portion is smaller...)"}
{"text":"It was either this or Quesada to fulfill my craving for burritos that day. I really liked it here. There is lots of choices for fillings, check out their menu - includes the standard steak, beef, pulled pork, but also yam, jerk chicken, butter chicken. In addition to the standard toppings, they add guac in for free (but very skimpy), and noodles (don't really see the need). Also a nice fun touch was the chips (crunchies). 

It was grilled to a perfect crunchiness. 

There isn't much space to eat, about 3 parties around the bar table at the window."}
{"text":"Oh burritos how I love thee! How do I express this love? By eating a yummy delicious burrito at fat bastards! A big ol' \"lil one.\" 

The flavours are good! The portions will get you completely full for hours on end. For you crazy hot heads- they got death sauce items! What is there not to love about this place? I personally wasn't a fan of the fried so definitely go for the baked chickens.. Mmm I must stop writing this review and go back for some more!

P.S they deliver as well! Perfection!!"}
{"text":"Food here is good, but often inconsistent. Service is passable. Prices are reasonable but if they were any higher I'd probably not come here anymore unless the quality and portions were more consistent, more fresh and portions were larger. Often times I find my burrito is thrown together and leaky by the time it gets home. Baked burritos also soggy and portions seem way too small for what you pay."}
{"text":"My new favourite cheat day meal. So good I had the baked chicken burrito and I want to try the others"}
{"text":"Ordered 2 steak burritos super salty in my opinion could not eat it. Very disappointed since I ordered on uber eats & it came to $30 for 2 burritos plus delivery. Waste of money and burritos"}
{"text":"loved it.  staff was friendly and we got to ask for exactly what we wanted on our burrito."}
{"text":"Fat Bastard Burrito is boss, but not this location sadly. Staff are welcoming, clean dining room, 2 televisions which were airing the Blue Jays game, all bang on! Perfect setting for a late night dinner. 

However I just didn't enjoy my 'House Special' Naked Burrito. Veggies and portion size was all adequate, but my sauce prepared with the steak was just way too sweet. This one is a tough one, guess it's just a preference of my palate. I've been to other locations and had a much better experience."}
{"text":"Decent and filling burritos! They offer a regular, large, and a jumbo sized burrito. Along with the regular beans and rice, they also let you add noodles to your burrito. Guac is included in the price.

It was quite tasty but could have done with more meat filling.

Comparable to Burrito Boyz."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the burritos here. They are so big I eat a lil one for 7.99 and that's already more than enough for me. The spicy sauce is super spicy coming from a person that likes spice. Mild is enough for me. Must come if u like burritos."}
{"text":"Two years later this place is still solid, I could eat their filling naked burritos daily! I went in 10pm at night, one hour before closing. All ingredients still fresh and my bowl was made to order. 

They were out of rice, but I was pretty grown up about it. Asked for extra noodles to compensate. Place was full of patrons waiting for their meals, which is an excellent sign of a great eatery. 

I'm so curious what bowl I'm going to try next... so far I've had the baked chicken, ground beef, shrimp bowl. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"AWFUL RIP OFF! We ordered a bean and cheese burrito and a stir fried veggie burrito. They were expensive and BOTH were 90% rice!!! When I called the restaurant to complain they told me to order and pay for another one. NEVER BUY FROM HERE!!! There are tons of great burrito places in Toronto including Burrito Boyz. Don't waste your money or aggravation with this awful place."}
{"text":"It is what it is, cheap food that tastes good when extremely hungry or drunk. 

The quesadillas suck, burritos are okay depending on who makes it and the naked burrito is pretty good most of the time. 

Don't over think it. Just eat it, fuck off and don't bitch as it is what it is"}
{"text":"Pleased to visit the new location.

This was the best tasting burrito I had in two years, hands down. Tequila lime was the name. Service was prompt, no hold ups, just waiting for my burrito to cook perfectly. The toppings station was very fresh looking and maintained for after the lunch rush.

So, it must be noted as I've said before, this business takes the crown due to the demise in quality I kept experiencing at certain other burrito business (that also stopped offering ground beef).

They have better seating here than older locations, and bonus outdoor tables around the corner provided by the mall.

As per most of my reviews, I'll share my best tip, hit lunch after 1pm to avoid the area's business crowd onslaught."}
{"text":"Found this place at the right time when another chain fell off the wagon on quality, in my opinion. Beyond noticing the difference myself, there is also a promise for using quality ingredients/suppliers online and in store.

Beyond that, there are noodles. A tasty, welcome alternative to replace rice. The uniqueness is also found among range of interesting burrito recipes I have yet to try. I'll have to update this review."}
{"text":"Let me just preface this by saying Fat Bastard is my favourite burrito chain! I am glad that there is one so close to my work.

That said, this location isn't the best. The toppings while are the same that they offer in other locations arent the same quality/taste. It still tastes good but I think the coleslaw for example is better at other locations.

I only visit during the week at lunch so its usually the owner working. He is super friendly and always packs on the toppings - I am always super full!

I will continue to visit here - I think it is better quality than other burrito places in the area, but they could make some improvements and be better!"}
{"text":"Good, standard burrito. I would go back for the convenience of being close to home and a tasty last minute option. Doesn't stand out from other burrito joints but reliable and good all the same. Nothing bad to say."}
{"text":"Ammending my previous 5 star review, I'm very disappointed and starting to get turned off by Fat Bastard restaurants. Portion sizes have dropped dramatically, the amount of food we received for a large Butter Chicken burrito was shocking! Very small amount of rice, vegetables and meat. The containers are large, they are meant to be full of food, not halfway. I don't notice prices have changed, so why the low portion size?

I hate skimpers in the food business, give your patrons good value for their money, not the feeling of being ripped off. \"Eat big or go home\" is now \"Eat and feel hungry hours later...\" Unacceptable guys!"}
{"text":"Best Fat Bastard I've ever been to and I've dined at quite a few. Ordered the \"Big Baked Chicken with Shrimp Naked Burrtio.\" 

Portion is massive! Lots and lots of meat, rice, noodles, green peppers, tomatoes, cilantro, noodles, guacamole. Come with an empty stomach and even if you do I doubt you can finish this entire container. Amazing flavour with just a touch of hot sauce, just a touch! Asked for medium but OH you gotta be able to take the heat. Totally worth the $10 bill. Thanks guys, great stuff. I'm a real happy bastard after that hearty meal."}
{"text":"Went to Fat Bastard Burrito for a lunch Hour, and this is not the first time i went to this location. I had the Butter Chicken burrito, and my friend had the chipotle chicken one. 

I have to say their pulled pork is better then this, the butter chicken was overcooked to begin with and it did not taste very good. The Buritto is definitely large enough to fill almost any appetite, however the size is all i can say for this burrito. It wasn't very good overall. 

The chipotle chicken had the same problem of the overcooked chicken, which made it very rough to eat, and not at all tender and nice.. 

This franchise has a lot of choices when it comes to toppings, howevr they are not equally as good. 

The one thing that does stand out at this place however, is that the Staff is very nice and friendly. this is definitely the strong part of this store.  I would suggest though that when someone tries this place next time, definetely don't' go for chicken in the burrito, and try the other flavours and meats"}
{"text":"Chicken burrito was good really hit the spot. The menu is sure to please. Became a bit full as customers gathered, maybe because there  is no \"serving\" area. Also would be better with an accessible door for those who need it."}
{"text":"Tried Fat Bastard for the first time. Sad to say I didnt enjoy my pulled pork burrito. There was barely any pork inside, the girl burned the tortilla too much and I found it lacked flavor. My boyfriend had the fish burrito, that was burned on the outside too much as well. The taste was OK. Perhaps this was am off night or just this location that didn't do it for me as I have heard \"fat bastard is good\".  I wont be eating here any time soon."}
{"text":"Experience:
- Came in to order take out before going to see a movie.
- We were new to the menu and the manager was friendly and help us selection.
- food came quick and was pretty tasty at a decent price.

Though it was not the best burrito that I have had living in Toronto, it is still a good burrito.  Recommended to those if you are craving burritos and on the go."}
{"text":"After having Burrito Boyz a few times, this place is just underwhelming.  The topping selection is limited, the meat is not seasoned, they over grill the meat.  

That is their main problem is that they don't season their meat.  So if you take a bite that misses some sauce or veggies, you get a taste full of unseasoned meat, which is just awful. 

This place is also more expensive than burrito boyz."}
{"text":"I can't edit the caption on my pics the first one is actually a specialty buttered chicken burrito big size (8.99) and the battered fish burrito is the lil size (7.99)

The battered fish burrito was delicious! Freshly fried fish, a bit crunchy and soft on the in side. The lil size is good for a single person, go for the huge size (not big size) for sharing.

I tried the hubby's buttered chicken (grilled) and it was good and he agreed, and would get the fish also next time.

I really like the many items you can put in the burrito, especially the noodles, chips, guacamole (no extra charge) etc. 

They grill it really nice and crunchy on the shell. 

Try the packaged chips on the rack, the black package (i think it habernaro) one is super spicy! I can probably only eat 3 and I would have to stop haha. 

The parking lot here is horrible!  there is always cars stuck at the enternece coming from all directions. They need more locations in the GTA

added: so we came back and shared the HUGE buttered fish and it was fully loaded and delicious!"}
{"text":"Portion sizes are big. Had the Tequila lime chicken. Was delicious!"}
{"text":"I preferred this over Burrito Boyz, and i was a huge BB fan. They have an innovative menu including roast steak, pulled pork and even a cheeseburger burrito! And yes the small is still a decent sized burrito.

They carry Blairs Death sauce and chips as well, usually hard to find. 

They even sell dried ghost peppers for anyone into making their own hot sauce."}
{"text":"Best burritos i've ever had, they were juicy, great options for the meat !! the burrito was packed!!! very filling
and their hot sauce is AMAZING!!! SOO PEPPERY SOO GOOD (but beware, very peppery sensation will occur)"}
{"text":"Great Burrito and great service.   I had the Tequila Lime Chicken.   Hit the spot. Next time I will try the steak.

Best Burrito in TO."}
{"text":"This place has had an opening soon sign for like a year. I saw it opened today and had to jump on it. I got a small chicken burrito. It was gigantic. Like I thought the competitors had huge portions. I won't need to eat for a week. I love their burrito sauce, too. Seems a bit more flavorful than others I've had. The only down side is that I said no green peppers and I ended up getting green peppers. Despite hating green peppers it was still awesome food. It'll be added to the lunch rotation."}
{"text":"Two flat screens playing the Jays game in high Def was a nice touch! Clean decor for the area. Got the Large Baked Chicken toppings were fresh and good value, noodles are new but an interesting touch.  Also polite service and I would def come back."}
{"text":"Huge

Burrito was a decent 6.5/10 and was very filling 

Unfortunately there are better right in the area so there is no reason to return 

Cousin had the quesadilla and was not very impressed with the lack of size

Overall not bad if it's open late when other similar options closed but not recommended otherwise"}
{"text":"After a year of waiting between when the \"coming soon\" sign went up and the actual door opened, I went in and bought two \"huge\" sized burritos - one Baked Yam, one Sauteed Shrimp.

I'll edit this review when I have some more spare time but I'll at least say that the burritos had a totally unique flavour, as well as unique topping options (coleslaw, noodles, and broken tortilla chips among a few). Definitely delicious, chock full of stuff and worth checking out. Prices range from the \"lil\" ($7/8) the \"big\" ($8/9) and the \"huge\" ($10.50/11.50). I'm not sure yet what the best value is - the huges certainly left us with delicious breakfasts tomorrow."}
{"text":"Probably the best burrito I've had in Toronto, though I've only had burritos at two other places. I've ordered a few times and only once was the food a bit bland (the pulled pork had no flavour; subsequent pulled pork orders were just fine).

I just tell them to give me everything (light on the hot sauce, though).

Fish is always a good choice!"}
{"text":"The WORST customer service I've ever encountered! I ordered a sautéed veggie burrito through Uber Eats and received a bean and cheese instead. When I called to see what could be done about the situation, I was told by the lady that bean and cheese and sautéed veggies were the same thing. Because I am a regular customer at another location, I know what sautéed veggies look and taste like and there was none in my burrito. I then told her that I was looking at my Uber Eats receipt at the moment and her story then changed to \"I just put whatever you asked for\" she never once asked me for my order number by the way). So now a manager (I assume) comes on the phone and convinces me that there are sautéed veggies in the burrito (and I could hear the girl in the back chipping in saying how she prepared the order how it appears on the screen). Anyways, she finally asks for my order number and when she (obviously) sees that my order is a sautéed veggie burrito, the story changes to \"the sautéed veggies are on there already.\" After I told her that I would come back and bring the burrito to show that there are no sautéed veggies in it she finally goes \"OK if you come back I'll remake it for you.\" 

I've never been accused of being blind to what's in my food when I'm the one eating it... Horrendous customer service. I shouldn't have to come back to prove what was put in my burrito. I understand mistakes happen but instead of blaming the customer you could apologize for the mistake and either remake the burrito or reimburse me of my money. I don't leave negative reviews often but I'm just so appalled at the service I received. I will never come back to this location, ever!"}
{"text":"Ordered from this location through Skip the Dishes. Food took almost an hour to arrive so I'm happy the burrito wasn't soggy--it was actually very enjoyable. I got the sautéed veggie burrito and finished every last bite of it. My complaint is regarding the chips and side guac, they were DISGUSTING! Chips were extremely undercooked to the point where they tasted rubbery. And someone clearly didn't know how to make guac properly as it tasted like mushed avocado with nothing else in it, completely tasteless. I actually had to throw the chips and guac away because they were just that bad. I have a picture of one of the tortilla chips attached to my review but if you can tell from the pic, the shiny part (which we first mistook for the oil it was fried in) is the undercooked part of the chip. 

I'd eat another burrito but am skeptical about ordering chips and guac for delivery."}
{"text":"The service was absolutely terrible! I went to get a burrito with like 15-20 minutes before close. The lady looked so annoyed with me being there. I also had to keep asking for toppings. I would never ever eat here again. NEVER !!! Go to Mucho it is way better and the service is amazing! Worst place in Whitby for burritos. I didn't finish it! It was gross!"}
{"text":"Used the Ritual app http://invite.ritual.co/JENNY1354 and got an exclusive deal.  My food was all ready when we got there.  No line up.  The burrito itself could had been warmer.  But it was tasty!  Service was good.  Place was clean."}
{"text":"Colleague brought me to this burrito place since Burrito Boys was packed. Ordered a large Baked Chicken Burrito. Everything can be customized to your liking. First time being asked if I want noodles in my burrito. I asked everything except for hot chilli pepper with mild hot sauce. The burrito was actually really good. The stuffing was well blend and there was a lot of flavour. Unlike Burrito Boys, I don't need a fork to eat it since they wrapped it really tight. Definitely would want to try their huge size next time to compare with Quesada's Big Ass Burrito."}
{"text":"Food was by far the worst tasting Mexican 'food' I've ever had. The chips and salsa were flavorless and my burrito had noodles in it! Topped off by the fact that I immediately got sick after eating the vegetarian burrito.  I would not recommend this establishment. I can't believe they're still open for business."}
{"text":"What can I say this place makes some awesome burritos.

I ordered the sweet Thai chicken burrito, one of their specials. I wasn't expecting too much from it cause you don't normally put sweet Thai in a burrito but the first bite was an explosion of awesomely good flavours. You get all the good flavours you'd expect from the burrito but then the Thai sauce gives it that nice kick of sweet and spice. The only problem I had was that there was not too many condiments to add into the burrito unlike other burrito places. But other then that the meal was splendid.

From outside you'd think the place doesn't get to much business cause of how unappealing it looks. But you just have to focus on what's on the inside and you'll see the beauty that it beholds. The inside had a nice modern look to it and made it feel like a fun place to be. But don't stay too long, once I stepped in the line just got longer and longer. 

No complaints on the service. Great job, was easy, fast and fun building my burrito. 

All in all the place was awesome and I will most likely revisit in the next week."}
{"text":"Great little spot.  As far as fast food burritos go, this place is pretty danm good. Its no chipotle, but i always feel that i have received good value for my money.

The ingredients are fresh and their service is quick."}
{"text":"Just devoured another veggie burrito at this humble establishment. I think these burritos are quickly making their way to the top of my \"best tasting burritos\" list. The only reason I did not give it a 5 star is because the burrito artist neglected to ask if my brother wanted tortilla crunchies in his burrito and he was crushed to find out his burrito was crunchie-less.
Aside from that, good ratio of toppings to sauce, perfectly compacted for a neat consumption, and the ghost pepper sauce is the perfect garnish on the tasty creation. Warning: too much ghost pepper sauce will have you surviving through the burrito rather than really enjoying it."}
{"text":"Came again. Had a large battered fish naked burrito (bowl). Everything was fine...save the fish. The fish was crispy and the fish was tender. The batter didn't gush oil and it didn't give me that really gross fish and chip aftertaste. What was wrong was the portion of it. I got about two sausage wiener's worth of fish. My bowl was so imbalanced. Not cool. I would like a battered fish naked burrito, not a naked burrito with a small side of fish sticks, especially if I have to add a dollar for the fish because it's one of their \"special\" fillings."}
{"text":"Why on earth did I not check reviews of this place before I ordered.

First of all, delivery took almost an hour inside downtown. The burrito was meh and as I was finishing the burrito I noticed it had lots of noodles in it. NOODLES! Since when have the Mexicans started putting Chinese noodles in burritos? I guess a cheap way to fill people up. I ordered 'roasted steak' but it looked like pork to me. I guess another way to make the burrito cheaper.

Then the fun started. Both me and my wife had upset stomachs all night. My stomach was upset the next day as well.

How the city allows this germ hole to stay open with multiple reports of people getting sick is beyond me. I would not eat their burritos for free."}
{"text":"I ended up here on the weekend simply because I didn't see the Burrito Boyz sign across the street.  As far as burritos go, they aren't the best but also not the worst.  If you are a burrito traditionalist this place may not be for you, but if you are tired of the Double B's and looking for a new taste adventure this place ain't bad. 
Staff is super awesome and the filling choices are ample (Tequila lime chicken, Beef, Random veggies) and they have a choice of rice or noodles.  On the day I visited the staff was experimenting with a roasted yam burrito as another choice for vegetarians (they already have 2-3 options, but hey variety is the spice of life).  Guacamole is applied with a heavy hand, which is much appreciated since most competitors are super stingy with the Green magic, and having three burrito sizes to choose from is super awesome, but prices are a bit steeper than most.  Hot sauce is really good, I'm a spice nut so I was over the moon, but my roommate did note that her medium spiced burrito was far spicier than the Double B's.  One quick tip, be forewarned  if you ask for \"Everything\" this will also include \"Crunchies\" aka crushed Doritos which may or may not be your cup of tea."}
{"text":"Ordered a big fish naked buritto and a pop which came up to $14. The guy skimped on the guac and put the lettuce and all cold toppings in the container first THEN asked if I wanted rice. Who does that!? So I have rice sitting on top of lettuce which is stupid as hell then my food is ready in literally 5 mins. I shouldve known then something was up. I asked him if the fish was cooked through and he said yes so I said alright. I get home and the fish is cooked through but it wasn't hot or fresh and it was so damn small ... I would not expect this for their \"big\" portion and I certainly expect more for that I paid . The fish was probably a leftover piece from someone's huge order. I used to come here all the time and now I know why I stopped and opted to go to burrito Boyz further down Dixie ... Absolute garbage. 

Also the kid that served me..Saw him digging his hands in toppings and opening cupboards with the same damn hand, doesn't matter if he's wearing paper thin plastic gloves. Cross contamination is no joke. Disgusting. I tried giving them a break and another chance but I'm done. Its not even worth a call to complain. Never again."}
{"text":"What do you expect? This place is quick and dirty. Sloppy half put together burrito/bowls. Feel like the majority of the people who come here are desperate for food and can't really leave the U of T campus area. Just walk a little further out. I promise it's worth it"}
{"text":"Fast service and really delicious pulled pork burrito. Will be coming back when I feel like pigging out again."}
{"text":"I had noodles in my burrito.

Yup. That was the most distinguishable part of my experience at Fat Bastard Burritos. I ordered the \"Lil\" (it's far from) Baja Chipotle Chicken Burrito, and it was pretty good. They have much of the same standard options that most burrito joints offer, so I'll talk a little about what they do differently.

I liked that they gave the option to have my chicken crispy or grilled. I chose crispy and in hindsight, it was definitely the right choice. It certainly added a different texture to the otherwise soft and chewy wrap.

The noodles were also a nice touch. I'm sure not much more has to be said about that.

I often pass by this place to go downtown, and given the pleasantness of my first experience, I'll likely be back.

Personal note: One personal qualm I have with most burritos is that one side is totally dry due to the concentration of all the sauces onto the other side. This burrito didn't have that problem and was flavourful all around."}
{"text":"You can't call yourself Fat Bastard Burrito when you cheap out on the meat. I've been here 2-3 times and the meat portions are pathetic. 2.5 star rating over 23 reviews.... Do you even care about your customers or are you just trying to pinch pennies?"}
{"text":"This new Burrito shop opened up down the road on the Queensway - west of Islington, East of Kipling. It's just a soft opening right now, so this won't be a full review.

When I first saw the \"Eat Big or Go Home\" sign, I groaned, thinking yet another Burger joint was opening up. If there is one thing we don't need any more of, it's Burgers, I don't care how good they are.

I was pleasantly surprised when it turned out to be a burrito resto. They spent some time and money transforming an old Makita Tool shop, into an upscale Burrito joint. A small steak burrito was a filling meal - covered with my choice of fresh toppings for about $7. Other choices included chicken, shrimp, and all-veggie. I will be back to try them again soon."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with burritos.  This place has it right; good portion, good flavors, good service.  

I always get half chicken, half beef, with everything in it.  The noodles you can add are great and it's nice to have an uncommon filling like that.  

Pricewise, Burrito Boyz is cheaper, though I'd say the trade-off in flavor makes it worth it.

4/5, this place hits the spot every time I come here."}
{"text":"i held it down for you here on yelp  you fat bastard. Got a big dutty shrimp burrito and I was not impressed. I ordered on Uber Eats and I specifically said NO cilantro. I HAVE THAT CHROMOSOME. It tastes like soap, its not my fault and I WONT let you CILANTRO shame me!! hmmph!  That's like giving me peanuts when I could die from peanuts! One of you hired goons added cilantro to the bottom of this soggy shrimp-lacking burrito! AND I'd like to know if the chow mein noodles were actually cooked cuz they looked very light skinned and dense.  Halfway through the burrito a thick goo formed and swallowed the lettuce/noodle sauce goo into one homogenized goop.  Think Majin buu.  Anyway, you guys need a grill for ur burritos if you wanna stand a chance in  food delivery.  This ainta game

3 stars"}
{"text":"I have been waiting weeks for FB to open and the day has finally come.
Came here for lunch this week with co-workers and I was not disappointed. 
The store is fresh and clean and servers were polite and welcoming.
Burritos come in 3 sizes but the portions are still large so bring your appetite. I had the tequila lime chicken burrito as expected it was great, fresh tasting but make sure you ask for the crunchies (I forgot this time)."}
{"text":"Another first, came here for lunch as I have not been too impressed with our burrito places and Fat Bastard comes out on top!

Both myself and a friend from work each ordered the Steak Burrito one with rice one with noodles and all the extra toppings (and their are tons) but as it was suggested by a friend you have to make sure you get the crunchies added and the amazing part was that you could taste each layer, the beans, the peppers, the steak, sauces etc.

The staff are very friendly and helpful if you are new to ordering and store was very clean.

Warning: Bring an appetite as the small is still huge and the hot sauce if you like spicy 4-6 drops is plenty!"}
{"text":"My Colleagues and I were craving burrito's for lunch and they recommend this place. It was close to work, so we made the trek.

Atmosphere: hip, trendy, small. Just bar stools over a counter top. Quick place - get in and get out.
Cleanliness: clean eating area. Food area was also clean and organized. 
Constructive criticism: there should be a cutlery station for all utensils needed. Ie, fork, spoon, knife, salt, pepper, napkins, straws etc. Would like to see real dinner napkins and not a rough paper towel. 
Cuisine: Mexican meets Texan.
Facilities: I didn't go.
Food: I ordered the Pulled Pork on a white bread wrap. Topped with brown bean spread, rice, lettuce, pico di gallo, cheese, 3 drops of their very hot hot-sauce, cilantro, green chilli peppers, salsa, guacamole and sour cream. (Onions, noodles, green peppers & jalapeños were offered but not chosen). 
Likeliness of returning or recommending to others: I would return here again but I wouldn't order the pulled pork again because I found the flavour factor to be disapointing. I did like the fact that guacamole wasn't an extra charge like most places, and I also like the nacho chip idea to put inside your burrito. Next time, I would like to try the Tequila Lime Chicken burrito! However, I would choose Mucho Burrito as my first choice where I know the flavour is alive!
Parking: private. 
Portion Sizes: large. I was full! I like the fact that there was 3 sizes to choose from. Lil', Big & Huge.
Price: fair. $12.41 with a bottle of water. 
Service: There were 4 people working in prime rush hour for lunch. This is great to see since they dont have a large eating area and the turn around time is quick. 
Selection: Wide variety of selection to choose from!"}
{"text":"Good burritos, guacamole isn't extra, and in my opinion better than the burrito boyz that's just the block over. Can get busy on a late bar night though."}
{"text":"This place was a HUGE fail for me! We were heading home from the movies (New Years Eve) and wanted to grab a quick bite to eat (Burger's Priest was closed). Even with the low reviews, a few people recommended Fat Bastard Burrito at various locations. I was most thankful that i had no expectations, so it wasn't a huge disappointment that the food was nothing i would go near again.

Where do I start??!?

Tequila Lime Chicken taco - everything in the description sounded good. What failed for me was the texture & taste of the chicken and the mild salsa that tastes like spicy bbq sauce. It left a horrible taste in my mouth. I can handle a lot of heat when it comes to salsa & other foods, but the description was \"mild salsa\" not bbq consistency and super spicy.

Ground Beef taco - this to me tasted like a chilli taco. The taste of the beans & the ground beef again was a huge fail and not what a taco should taste like. It tasted like chilli in a soft taco. Same \"mild salsa\" that was spicy & tasted like bbq sauce

Side of guacamole - flavourless & disappointing.

$9.00 for a cheese quesedilla!?!? 

We ordered 1 of each. I only ate 1 of each and didn't go near the rest. Not sure there is anything on the menu i would venture back for. Everything tasted the same, so i imagine the meat is the same for the burritos etc.

The 1 star is for being open until 10pm on New Years while most of our fav spots closed at 6pm today."}
{"text":"UGH sad, my friends talked up Fat Bastard so much this weekend that I decided to try it out instead of my usual place in the Grange. WHAT A MISTAKE. They had it ready when I got there (used ritual) so that was good but that is where the good ends. I got the sweet and spicy tofu with beans, rice, cheese, cilantro, Guac, sour cream, Bastard Sauce and Crunchies. All I could taste was sauce, cheese and  rice for half of it. Then I got to the worst tofu I have ever had! I actually picked it out!!! I have never done that before. It tasted stale, just awful. There were no crunchies, the whole thing was soggy and extremely bland even with all that sauce. By far the worst burrito I have ever had, and I am mad at my friends for making me waste 10.00! Though it does seem like people are saying it is this location, it was so bad that I will not be trying any of their other ones."}
{"text":"Every time I come to Toronto, my cousins take me to Burrito Boys.  That has become a staple of every visit, but this year, we went to Fat Bastard because it was close to where we were and I thoroughly enjoyed my burrito!

We went there around 12:30 at night, a little bit before they were about to close.  The guys working at the restaurant were extremely nice and friendly.  I ordered a bean and rice veggie burrito and asked for everything in it.  I'm not a big fan of cole slaw, but I figured to just do the works and it was a very nice complement to the rest of the burrito.  I got it spicy, with extra hot sauce, and the cole slaw gave it this sweet taste to it.

Solid burrito and it filled me up with just getting the Lil.  They have two larger sizes too.  I thought it wasn't going to close, but they grill the burrito at the end and pack it up nicely - solid  food and will definitely add this to my late night spots when I go to Toronto.  Very clean too!"}
{"text":"First things first... It's the second time I ate there in the last month, and I can honestly say that I love the choices you get from this place as per you get some different choices from their competitors. And also the taste is great.  I strongly suggest to compare!  And you be the judge!

But for my review.  Alot of other places are good too, in their own way, don't get me wrong.

But if we compare it to it's competitors, you will have some very welcome surprises.  

1 - Tastier
2 - Bigger
3 - More Choices
4 - Price is fair and good :)
5 - Smiling and fun staff"}
{"text":"This is my first burrito from this chain restaurant and it was so good!! The plc was clean and spacious (don't let the exteriors fool u).

I got the ground beef burrito (size small) and it was so filling and delicious. It was around $9. They let you pick the toppings (free guac oh yeah) and the person who took my order was pretty friendly and was able to answer my questions. Not a lot of people were there when I went, but I'd say it's because of the area not because it's bad (a lot of work offices, so burritos and mex food probably wouldn't be the first thing office people would think of at lunch). the stuff tasted fresh. 

I asked for hot sauce on the side and they forgot to give it to me :( and the burrito wasn't hot enough even when I only had about 2 min of travel time in between, so I had to microwave it.  

But overall I'd deffff come back !!"}
{"text":"Very tasty burritos. Very filling even the little one, nice place and staff are friendly."}
{"text":"Just ate there for the first time.. Tons of topping and very filling"}
{"text":"Ok burrito but rude staff..I don't need to go back!  There are may places in the city that make you feel wanted."}
{"text":"I am no burrito expert but I do like like them. Burrito bros is ok but holy smokes, this place rules. After getting their most popular with some extra tastey lime or lemon, man this burrito sang in my mouth. Whoa. Should any Mexican making these be scared? Yeh, I think so. Staff were pretty cool and young, it was pretty easy and fast to get to the thing. Definitely a repeat for little old me in my hood. Drop by one day, I might buy yah one."}
{"text":"Fantastic burrito joint. Friendly service, great burritos, popular and deservingly so. Must try: crushed tortilla chips, their cabbage topping, and burrito sauce.

Side note: heir \"Big\" size is enormous. If you're not famished - or don't have a huge stomach - I'd go for the \"Tiny\"."}
{"text":"I have really tried with this place, I really did. Its close and when it first opened it was amazing but it seems the good people at Fat Bastard on Queen are more annoyed that people have come in for business.
I have no idea why it is so hard for the employees to roll a burrito. I have gone in a few times now hoping that they would have mastered this skill but alas i get a burrito that falls apart once opening it and resembles what it should look like after its gone through my system! At least they are consistent.... with sucking at making burritos."}
{"text":"Came here with Mr. Rosie S. before seeing a show at SummerWorks at the Theatre Centre - it's right down the street. We WERE heading to Pizza Pizza, then saw Subway... then realized this area actually has a bunch of better options now - it used to be a culinary wasteland! So this is good. Yay for you, West Queen West!!!

We had to choose between burritos, poutine, pub food, chain fast food, tapas... lovely to have so many choices! A very nice surprise. It was about 8 p.m. and everything was open - also nice to see this area bustling!

The menu at Fat Bastard Burrito is small but extremely customizable, consisting of burritos (Lil, Big or Huge sizes available), quesadillas, as well as sides like fries, onion rings, poutine (!?), corn on the cob, chips/salsa, chips/guac, etc. There are about 15 burrito options, ranging from sweet chili thai chicken, steak to battered fish and garlic shrimp. 

On the veghead side of things, I have been sadly disappointed at the available options at other burrito places - sooooo not the case here - quite the opposite - lots to choose from!
- roasted yam
- roasted veggies
- bean & cheese
- \"naked\"

You choose your burrito, then start stuffing it! You choose from beans, rice, NOODLES (crazy! I've never seen this before, and it seems like an interesting fusion idea. I will definitely be trying the noodles next time! Apparently Chino Locos also has this offering, but I've never been!), guac, sour cream, salsa, pico de gillo, cheese, various veggies, sauces, you get the idea.

They offer deep-fried Mars or Snickers bars (!), freshly made tortilla chips, smoked ghost peppers you can take home, etc. Also worth mentioning is the MEXICAN COKE. Holy smokes... who knew there was such a difference? I'm telling you: TRY IT. The pico de gallo is also definitely worth mentioning - fresh and lovely! The tortillas seemed fresh and house-made, though we didn't ask.

The special of the day was Baja Chipotle Chicken - we were warned it's pretty hot, so stayed away for now. We hear a lot about the Tequila Lime Chicken - may be up next on the \"to try\" list.

Mr. Rosie S. ordered the Pulled Pork Burrito (\"Big\" size) and you should have heard the noises he was making. Loved it. He said it was much, much, much more flavourful than the other burrito places we've tried (Burrito Boyz, Burrito Banditos, Hernando's Hideaway, etc.) in the city. I would agree, and add that the array of choices, the great texture and freshness, and the friendly staff put it above the rest by miles.

Anyway, once you've stuffed it, the meat goes in and they take it to the grill. 10 minutes later, it's chow time.

They cut the burrito in half (they asked first) - as he thought he'd only eat one half, claiming he wasn't very hungry... but it was so good he ate the whole thing!! Yumyumyum! I 

Other things to note: 
- take lots of napkins if you're leaving the place
- make sure to take advantage of the staff's wisdom on range of spiciness. You could get burned... so to speak... 
- there is not much room for seating/eating - just a counter around two short walls, with 6 or 7 stools.
- menu is available online at fatbastardburrito.ca"}
{"text":"Went there last week got the largest beef burrito. It was very good i recommend the bean paste for people who don't like rice"}
{"text":"Really disappointed. I can't speak to the food because we showed up 30min before close and the door was locked. I live in the area so I might try back some time, but this was quite irritating.

UPDATE:

I finally ate here. The food is good -- the staff are super grump."}
{"text":"Quick and filling meal for around $10. I've usually stuck with their chicken burrito, which I find can be a bit dry occasionally. They stack typical burrito toppings on quite generously, so be prepared for a big and possibly messy burrito when you eat it.

I've also heard that their naked burrito bowls are delicious, although I've never gotten around to trying one. Do beware that their \"small\" sizes are quite filling for me for a dinner, so unless you're very, very, then opt for the bigger burrito sizes.

Even if there's a long line-up, typical wait times are around 5 minutes at most, which is pretty reasonable for a place that mainly does take-out orders. There are about a dozen or so seats, but the environment there is a bit loud and full especially during peak lunch hours."}
{"text":"Picked up a Tequila Chicken Burrito after being at a place for dinner that just wasn't filling enough. For 8.99, picked up a large burrito that was decent.

I kinda wish the chicken was like cubes, but i guess shredded may absorb more of the flavor, but I didn't taste much tequila.

Compared to \"the original\" burrito place in this city that has been around for a while and where I always go get burritos that are grilled on a skillet that it must be compared to, I don't think this one is as good but it's decent and more convenient.

They also have more variety. I'd come back here if I just needed a burrito quick."}
{"text":"Extremely sick after having dinner from this location. I won't be returning. The staff here are also easily flustered by a busy crowd and don't listen that well. I highly suggest finding another spot."}

Nasty, rude service, gave me the trots.
The burrito was almost edible...but 'yummy'?  oh hell no.

This is not the burrito you're looking for"}
{"text":"Happy we finally got one of these places in town. Had one in Toronto before and could wait to try this place. Went for a Huge Double Ground Beef Burrito with all the fixings. Turned out just the way I wanted!! If you love burritos and need one in a hurry, this place is awesome!!"}
{"text":"The best burrito place EVER!!! Great customer service, staff is very friendly! Would highly recommend this spot."}
{"text":"Great quality Mexican food and big portions. You get to customize your meal so it is really a great place. Very casual but nice atmosphere"}
{"text":"Overpriced, smaller portions than other Fat Bastard locations, and worse service. Why waste your time when there are tons of better burrito options in this city?"}
{"text":"The burritos are consistently ok. But they aren't anything special. And definitely not the best burritos the city has to offer. I like the creativity of their \"specialties\" but \"classics\" are not seasoned as well as some other burrito locations. Their standard baked chicken burrito has. Also been disappointingly dry at two separate locations. Also, considering there is a chalkboard in the front saying one of the daily duties is removing cilantro stems there were a lot of stems in my burrito!"}
{"text":"Very bad burrito place!! I cant belive it how cheap they are on serving toppings, I almost had to fight for a few extra pieces of green onion! Extremely rude staff including some kid that is working with cash and he is serving food without washing his hands..never again!! There is so many options in the area and this place for me doesn't exist!"}
{"text":"I had the butter chicken burrito. I thought it was pretty good. Will try some others. I did find the service a little on the slow side."}
{"text":"Service was good but for some reason this location is not as good as the one on queen st. very salty and a poor amount of the main dish. Sad experience here today."}
{"text":"We come here sometimes.  In the summer we like to frequent the beaches so this place is definitely a contender when we are down here.
I don't think it's better or worse than other locations.  I usually order something of the fish variety, which is ok.  My hubby likes their specialty ones.  It hits the spot when you're hungry.

The service here isn't better or worse than other quick serve places in the area.  They serve a purpose but aren't doing anything over an above."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying that this place almost gets a one star if it wasn't for the guy working the counter who was actually pretty decent at his job. 

Now that THAT is out of the way, what a terrible place to eat food. 

Like really, the sign outside the shop bolding states that it's the best burrito in town... Are they talking about Toronto? Did they steal the sign from another town? Is there burrito store in Sutton, On missing their sign? Can someone check? 

For a whopping 15 dollars, I ordered a sweet potato \"big\" burrito bowl. I added extra cheese and guac, yet the sign said they didn't charge extra for those toppings... yet somehow the price magically went up? I also asked for a receipt and didn't get one, so the egg on my face on that one...  

The Sweet Potato was burnt... the rice was pretty bland... WHY ARE NOODLES ARE TOPPING? WHAT WOULD JESUS THINK?! 

The beaches need really great Mexican joints, and I'm sad to say that this doesn't really meet even such a basic expectation of even a quick lunchtime snack. 

If you're going to put accolades on your wall and a sign out front saying that you're the best - You gotta back it up yo."}
{"text":"Solid burritos. I wouldn't say they are the best in the city, but they are good and they offer a lot of variety in different toppings and sauces. As others have mentioned a huge is a damn big burrito. They manage lines well during busy hours and I've yet to have them mess up my order. If you're looking for a place to stop by for a burrito and are around this place then I'd definitely give it a shot."}
{"text":"Great burritos, prices are fair but I would say compared to Wilbur in Toronto it doesn't match up. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"I think the picture says it all. That is a \"chicken burrito bowl\", believe it or not. What a DISGUSTING MESS. And the chicken is CANNED CHICKEN which they couldn't even bother to drain properly. I asked for beans and lettuce in my order. I couldn't find any beans and the little pieces of lettuce that were there were wilted and soggy. I can't believe anyone would have the audacity to charge money for this. It went straight to trash."}
{"text":"Their logo, \"freaking huge\" should be revisited, as my naked burrito was lacking in proportion and was far from \"freaking huge\". The serving was so little and it costs around $9 for a big baked chicken naked burrito. I've gone to Burrito Boyz and they serve more and not afraid to give more. The chicken was so dry."}
{"text":"I was never much of a burrito person until this Fat Bastard entered my life one fateful late evening last summer.

\"A lil tequila lime chicken please,\" I said. Their idea of \"lil\" is not the same as mine, but do not mistake this as a complaint. Generous portions of all your typical fixings (lettuce, pico, guac, cheese, peppers) plus unique ones such as noodles (A MUST!) and \"crunchies\" (AKA those hot-as-death chips) are piled sky-high to the point one must wonder, how will these wonderfully nice people close this burrito?

It's a true art what they do here, managing to fit all those toppings into one tortilla is a skill most enviable. The tequila lime is my favourite, but my partner in crime swears by the baja chicken. I've also tried the baked yam (though don't be fooled: to heat it up they do toss it in the deep fryer for a minute) and it was awesome, again huge portions. The pulled pork is my friend's fave, but it wasn't for me. They have a large selection of flavours, as well as quesadillas that are built much the same. 

Be warned: the hot sauce here is super hot! The last time I got a burrito here I passed on all things spicy.

Sizes come in lil, large and huge, the latter of which truly does live up to it's name. I've personally never ordered anything bigger than a \"lil\" and with toppings so generous, finishing even that can be a challenge!"}
{"text":"This is for the 628 King St. Toronto location. Ok burritos are not really in the Mexican cuisine, maybe I should gotten the clue is a bastard, but come on it was a very bad attempt. Quesadillas tequila lime no taste of tequila or lime with a very 
dry chicken like meat. Big dissapointment for a Puerto Rican living in Chicago. I hope you can do better for 37 Canadian dollars (2 quesadillas a burrito and 3 sodas) than what I did."}
{"text":"Let's first begin with the butter chicken burrito bowl - it tasted like a presentation that you've spent a week preparing for just to fail - utter disappointment. The toppings were soggy, the butter chicken was dry and hardly coated. The noodles tasted like instant ramen and there wasn't much rice. There wasn't much flavour.

Next, the chips. I thought to myself that there was no way to go wrong with chips, but I stand corrected. The chips tasted like a Saturday night out with your friends that you'd planned for months just to have everyone bail last minute - utter disappointment AGAIN. The chips were coated with such a thick layer of grease that they gained a translucent sheen. If I used an oil blotting paper on it, I'd probably be able to conclude that it is greasier than my forehead back when I was 15. The chips were incredibly soggy and lacked any type of crunch. Chewing it was such a laborious task that I had mistaken it for celery. I would not be surprised if these chips have negative calories because I probably spent quite a few calories chewing these soggy chips. 

The only saving grace I can think of for this meal was the guac. The guac was delicious and fresh. I thoroughly enjoyed the 1 spoonful of guac that was added to my burrito bowl."}
{"text":"The food and service at this location are both great. The food is definitely worth your money; you're getting huge portions of quality food for a fair price. When I went, the employees were friendly and helpful, helping me build my burrito even though I didn't know what I was doing. I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"This is an overpriced sham next to other burrito chains I visit. Not only does it cost more, with fewer options/varieties (except the noodles, which is random but yummy), and terrible tasting rubbery tiny shrimp, but the logo is incredibly racist and offensive! That alone brought my rating from 3* to 0.

Sauteed veggies option means sauteed green peppers. 

Nothing special, not worth the money."}
{"text":"Here is probably the best way to describe Fat Bastard Burrito (Dixie Road Location ONLY)

Service: 5/5 - The service behind the counter was super amazing!... Very clean, and hands that touched money, never touched food.  Gloves are worn, very hygienic 

Quality of Food: 5/5 - Food is made to order, so what you select is what you get!

Temperature of Food: 5/5 - Quick, and always HOT

Value of Meals: 4/5 - Prices are much better than Burrito Boyz's, and it tastes so much better here.

Atmosphere: Friendly service, quick and you get what you ordered!

Would I Return: Yes

{"text":"So off on one of my lunch adventures, some people at work told me to try this place did, and so I did.  It's in a plaza with a lot of other stuff but if you look to the right side of the plaza you'll notice it right next to a Mac's.

The place isn't really big, it's more of a buy and go place, but there is some space to eat if you'd like.  The burritos are made to order so you'll probably have to wait about 5-10 minutes before your burrito is out.

Now when I ordered they asked my for your normal beef, pork, chicken etc.  But what really threw me off when when they asked if i wanted noodles in the burrito.  I thought that was kind of weird so I didn't go for it...  Just the normal please.

After trying the burrito I can definitely say it's way better than mucho burrito down the street, but it's not exactly the best I've had."}
{"text":"Absolutely awful, I had the butter chicken with double meat.  Its more expensive than chipotle, less filling and honestly doesn't taste any where as good.  I had difficulty tasting the chicken in the wrap and the chicken had no texture.  The only redeeming quality is the size and even then its not particular impressive compared to either burrito boyz or chipotle."}
{"text":"I don't know why I even bother going to Fat Bastard Burritos anymore. Our last few times going to this location have been disappointing. 

I ordered the burrito bowl in \"large size\"... They barely filled the box much less than half way. The employees were not attentive and mostly talking amongst themselves, even when it was busy and there was a line up. I asked for a mix of noodles and rice, but didn't realized when I got home I didn't get any noodles. Anyways, not worth the $12 for the \"large\" at this location.

They are friendly people, but just distracted while working.

At other FBB locations they fill up the box decently, whereas here (for my last few recent visits) they do not follow through with their \"Eat Big or Go Home\" motto."}
{"text":"I can't believe this restaurant was approved for a business license with this name. It is painfully racist and an insult to the Mexican people. Toronto now has a thriving Mexican community and this is a disgrace. Both the name and the logo are deeply stereotypical, bigoted, offensive, racist, demeaning."}
{"text":"This has to be the most offensive, most racist, bigoted, hateful name and logo for a business that I have ever encountered. How can the city of Toronto allow this? There is a thriving Mexican- Canadian community in Toronto and this is an insult to each and every member of that community."}

{"text":"Getting better. Everything I ordered in stock today. Avocado Guacamole awful though, tastes like raw grass"}
{"text":"Got the chicken quesadilla and it tasted nothing how a normal quesadilla usually does the prices are OK but the food is not the chicken was mushy like it came out of a 10 hour long stew no flavor at all and toppings weren't good at all the only good part was the burrito sauce they put I was very disappointed."}
{"text":"Delicious, better than burrito boys! Got the Chicken burrito full loaded, it was the best burrito i think i have ever eaten!"}
{"text":"Location is one of the few affordable value meals around city place that hosts a quick serve restaurant under $15 that's in a bar heavy area. The space is clean and spacious to sit down for a bite or grab a meal to go. The food is abundant in flavor and you can add guacamole with no extra charge such as that at burrito boys or chipotle. Would definitely categorize this store as value buy as the burritos are HUGE. Note to ladies, don't go here on a date if you plan on keeping your man. You can't avoid slobbering or taking it in one mouthful to taste all the ingredients. Only a three star review as I found not one, but two bones in their baked chicken burrito. Not the best teeth experience when happily chowing down then getting a surprise crack on one bone too many. Overall would recommend if you're on the run and pass by for a bite, but not the type of place that's a target destination you would specifically come to try out their food."}
{"text":"First mistake. Ordering delivery.  Second mistake.  Not cancelling the order after it took an hour and a half.

We finally got our food only to be greeted by the driest, blandest, most BURNT quesadilla I've ever had in my life.  

I was starving and decided to throw it out an eat a bowl of Cheerios.  Save your cash."}
{"text":"First of let's start of by saying that I LOVEEE burritos  and i have to say that this chain so far beats their competitors without doubt. Firstly, you're given an option of two types of chicken - fried (which is actually crispy and real yum) and boiled. Guac is included in your price!! Noodles and crushed nacho inside your burrito is also an option  Overall, the heartland location had really welcoming staff and portion size is great.
- I recommend the crispy chicken tequila burrito"}
{"text":"This is the WORST burrito I have ever had. It basically tasted like mush. I got the fried tequila lime chicken burrito and the chicken was dry. I believe I actually ate the fried batter. Do not waste your money on this place."}
{"text":"Ordered a lil naked yam and grilled veg burrito! The service was great and the food was ok but having 3 or 4 pieces of grilled vegetables doesn't really count as a significant order. Which means I really just over paid. #fail"}
{"text":"This place is great! Everything is fresh and made right in front of you the way you like it. What I like about this place is that they have the organic tofu for vegetarians as well as vegans. There is also the option of just a cheese burrito or a sautéed vegetables burrito. I have tried both and they are both amazing. The burrito comes in three different sizes: lil, big, and huge. The quesadillas are good as well for vegetarians there's only the cheese option. In the burritos as means you can put rice, beans, and/or noodles. The hot sauce is really spicy but so good!  The place itself is very modern, clean and organized. It is a little expensive but worth it. I love this place! Great tasting burritos and quesadillas!! 

Most importantly GUAC IS FREEEEE!!  You can get as much as you want!!"}
{"text":"I work near this place and it's a go-to for when I want a good filling meal for under $10. The big size pulled pork is a generous portion of your typical burrito toppings. They also add in these chow mein egg noodles, which was a weird experience biting into the first time but is now a welcome addition.

Their chicken flavours are all some sort of baked chicken tossed in a new sauce. Nothing special. Pulled pork the way to go!

Mild spicy already has a kick so beware!

Service fast but impersonal. But I'm in and out in 5 minutes so whatever."}
{"text":"Tried this place three times. They have the hottest sauce in town. A delicious blend of spices that bring such joy that ends with a fiery hell fire. Unfortunately somewhere between that delicious sauce and me is the burrito and its maker. And that burrito seems to be suffering from a lack of confidence.  It overcompensates with other sweet sauces and a mishmash of ingredients that seem confused as to what they're doing there."}
{"text":"Awful burrito bowl! I threw mine out since I found it to be inedible. I'm a huge fan of mexican fast food and this honestly does not compare to Burrito Boyz or Quesada. Their fusions just don't work well together. Terrible flavours."}
{"text":". Frankly the staff here is ALWAYS rude. Th toppings are plain and bland compared to burrito boyz. The last straw for me was watching one of the female staff run around the back doing stuff and then picking up my Burrito with her bare hands to wrap it. I took it home, didn't eat it. I was scared to ask them to make it again due to her unhygienic mistake but they seem like the kind of staff that would spit on your chicken."}
{"text":"Came here for a burrito. I got the baked chicken. Funny thing is I think that normally it needs to contain chicken to be considered a chicken burrito. There was barely any in there. I love burritos but this was the first one in a long time I did not finish. I left probably a quarter of it in the trash. Would not come back here. Seems like uoft students are helping this place cling to life as they serve horrible food to hungry kids."}
{"text":"Delicious, good value, huge portions where for myself my Frd n I had to share.  Better than a lot of other places.  Love this place.  Wish that this place was closer to my workplace."}
{"text":"This is a pretty decent burrito joint in liberty village. Currently it is the only one in the neighborhood I believe. LV prices, huge size comes to about $15. Ingredients are not bad, but the meat is not a huge amount and gets lost amongst the fillings.  

I see so many whiners about this place and rest assured it is not 1* bad - those are just snowflake whiners. Is it the greatest ? No, by a longshot, but it is decent and filling when you have that burrito craving. 

The staff are fine. Don't believe the bullshit you read about how they are rude or inattentive.  I've been in this neighborhood for more than half a decade and eating at this place - people working there are ok.  Recently more and more snowflakes are moving to LV and distorting the whole place complaining about everything and everyone. Ignore."}
{"text":"It's hit or miss. Sometimes they make your burrito properly, when using Ritual, sometimes it's missing half the ingredients. Most of the staff don't seem happy, and I have even seen some of them prepare food while being obviously sick. I'm not a picky eater so I enjoy it, other would probably not."}
{"text":"all of these burrito choices and all of them trying to fit in. would I eat here all the time? probably not, but if I'm craving a burrito and I saw this, sure I'd stop in.

You may have seen these popping up or heard the commercials on radio, and they really create and expectation of being a premium high end burrito. it's like any others like Burrito boyz (I was a huge fan) and much burrito (but no restaurant).

The pricing right off the bat is around $8-$13 and lots of premade combinations. they also have a gluten free tortilla which is available in the large size.

I had the butter chicken and loaded it. it tasted okay but it wasn't traditional butter chicken. you know the kind where after you eat all the meat you want to use the sauce as dip and flavor for any other food? ya it wasn't that. didn't have that going for it. the other topping and veg were fine and it was grilled on a flat top to finish. so yes it's a burrito.

Just wasn't sure it was worth u-turning and going through construction (area is under heavy construction at the time I went) to get to.

If you want a burrito and don't want to get a \"big franchise\" one then come by here."}
{"text":"So my fiancé and I have had a long standing debate... who does the best burritos in town?  He has always been a Burrito Boyz fan, I however stood by Fat Bastards claiming they were the \"one to beat\" so we decided to do a good ol fashioned taste off.  We ordered the exact same thing at both Fat Bastards and Burrito Boyz.  

Here is what we found:  

ORDERING
Burrito Boyz.  When calling to place the order we were greeted with a friendly voice to take our order.  Placing the order took only a minute or two, and were told to pick the burrito's up in about 10-15 minutes.  Super quick!  
Fat Bastards.  When calling to place the order the chick on the phone seemed annoyed we were calling  (I must add that I normally just walk in when ordering from Bastards) I was put on hold several times, just trying to place the order took me like 10 minutes....  We were told to pick up the burrito in about 15 minutes. NOT a good start.

PICKING UP THE ORDER
Burrito Boyz.  Quick and painless!
Fat Bastards.  Waited an additional 15 minutes because they were really really busy.

THE BURRITO
Burrito Boyz.  The small is big as hell and had a ton of extra guac, just how I like it.  Spiciness was just right and the bean, cheese, veggies ratio was good.  All in all, very pleased.   And only $6 for a bean and cheese with extra guac.  
Fat Bastards.  The Reg was smaller than a burrito boyz small, spiciness was great (I love a spicy burrito) I asked for extra guac and paid $1.00 for nothing because no extra guac was given.  Ratio was good, just wish they weren't being so chincy on the toppings.  Paid $10 for bean and cheese with extra guac.  

THE VIRDICT
Sadly... my long time fav (Fat Bastards) was quickly knocked down and beaten to a pulp by the Boyz.  After doing a side by side comparison and taste test Burrito Boyz wins in every aspect.  The service, quantity, quality and price were easily handed to the Boyz.  The only thing that might have me going back to Fat Bastards is the deep fried creations... not the burritos.  

If you want a good burrito go to the place across the road where you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Good portions. I had the daily special Pad Thai. A little pricy but will find and use a coupon next time."}
{"text":"Came by because I was in the strip mall and was hungry. I ordered a lil naked bowl and left not satisfied. Portions are not great for the price you pay although the food tasted pretty good. 

I prefer burrito boyz - much better by far!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to go here for a late lunch before hitting the tough tasks of moving things into the new condo near by.

The location is pretty small, little dine-in space so it is suggested to take elsewhere.

The cashier was very timid, she also did not look like she enjoy being there. While putting our food together, we could barely hear what she was asking us, we kept asking her to repeat herself.

The cook seemed to be doing all the work, we could hear her shouting orders, getting things done and being a pro at it. It did get busy for one person to handle approximately 10 plus orders.

The manager who arrived a little later to the scene, jumped to work right away to took care of problems and got everything back in line.

There was a kid, about 5 years of age, who mistakenly ordered stuff he didn't like on his burrito, the mom tried really hard to make him try it, since he did order it. The manager was understandable and gave a replacement burrito on the house.

Now lets talk about food, our chicken was really dry and the toppings were very stingy, I mean, I've been to other locations, and it is a huge difference."}
{"text":"One of the best burrito, I'd eaten.  They are generous with the topping choice and portion.  Spicy sauce is satisfying.  The added crunch is nice."}
{"text":"@bastardburrito @foodora_ca #BASTARDBURRITO #BURRITO #HURRIER 

I should've read the reviews of this particular location before I placed an order on Hurrier, now Foodora. I ordered a large burrito, and sure enough it was a good size. However, the burrito was soggy and unappetizing. Didn't taste the lime or the guacamole. I was going to blame it on the delivery service first, but it's clearly this location. 

I would love to try an actual fat bastard burrito from another location and maybe I'll have a few comparisons to make."}
{"text":"Food is great when you have a the right people working. 

That being said the staff will talk over you, put what they want on your burrito and push your order along so they can continue socializing. 


Making my order correctly was not at the top of their priorities. 

---
I originally made this review before actually eating the food I ordered. Which I realize was unfair. 

After eating the burrito, I can safely say that it I was the worst burrito I have had from any of the Toronto Chains. 

Their attention to detail shows. 

So I have updated my rating."}
{"text":"I am persuaded to visit this chain by a co-worker.  Is it tasty? Yes.  Is it large portion?  Yes.  Is it authentic?  It depends.  It depends because the customer decides how the burrito is made, the toppings, the sauce, if any.  Therefore, it is not appropriate for me to pass a judgement as to whether Fat Bastard serves authentic burritos.  However, I can attest that the baked chicken tasted bold, but the refried beans and the guacamole could be less diluted and the Mexican rice can be less mushy.

Service was friendly and efficient.  The storefront seemed quite clean.  This is a great lunch spot."}
{"text":"In two words, \"never again\".

I was there several months ago and it was OK, but not outstanding. When I went again a couple of months ago, the food was average at best, and the pace was glacial. I thought to myself that it would be a long time before I tried again, and after tonight's experience, I think that it should have been even longer than I allowed it.

I should start off by saying the place was not busy when I arrived. The person ahead of me had just completed placing her order and one person started assembling it while my order was taken right away. I had a simple order - two burritos. According to the cash receipt, my order was taken at 7:47 PM.  At 7:58, they asked what we wanted on the first one. Yes, 11 minutes after the order was taken, they were finally ready to start on it. I was actually about to ask them to cancel the order and give me a refund. There is a McD's across the parking lot - I could have gone there, ordered a meal and eaten it, and then walked back in the time I spent waiting at FBB. When they finally did get around to asking what we wanted on the burritos, we had to repeat ourselves a few times. To be kind, their basic language comprehension skills are lacking.

As I said in my intro, \"never again\".  And this time, I mean it.  I'm not even willing to give another location a chance. I should have gone to the California Sandwiches down the road - much better."}
{"text":"No idea why they call it fat burrito. They put half the chicken that burrito boyz puts and they are costlier. Sucks."}
{"text":"This location of Fat Bastard probably gets a bit of a bum rap on this site. It's a far cry from superior burrito joints like Burrito Boyz and Burrito Bandidos, but they put out a perfectly edible product that's miles beyond Chipotle.

On this occasion, I decided to try one of their \"fusion\" burritos: Sweet Chili Thai Chicken. I ordered it with most of the recommended toppings and asked for it on a white tortilla and with fried chicken (rather than baked).

The fried chicken aspect was a disaster, pretty much. It contained a few chunks of breaded chicken that were so big I had to eat them separately (ie they didn't blend with the rest of the burrito). The rest of the toppings were fine, although the \"Sweet Chili Thai\" sauce was extremely sweet and almost overpowering.

It's also, as many other people have noted, extremely heavy on the rice. I asked for veggies but I honestly didn't taste much aside from rice and refried beans.

But since the Burrito Boyz a few doors down is almost always packed, Fat Bastard will do in a pinch."}
{"text":"Disappointing. No where near the quality of other burrito joints located in Vaughan.

Two of us dropped in for lunch yesterday and I was not wowed by anything here.

I had the Lime Chicken burrito, which despite its name, didn't have a flavour of lime to it. I was expecting even a hint, as the other items in the burrito could have masked the flavour, but I didn't detect any lime at all. The amount of chicken is no where near as generous at Mucho Burrito. I added: red beans, rice, cheese, salsa, lettuce, jalapeño peppers, and burrito sauce. It was passable but nothing that was good enough to bring me back.

My dining companion ordered a beef burrito and he was clearly not impressed...he left about a quarter of it, despite being hungry. 

Seating is counter style and is minimal at best  (perhaps 6-8 ppl could dine in at once).

The female staff member working behind the counter was friendly and pleasant.

Prices were on par with other burrito places I've visited."}
{"text":"SO yummy!

Ordered a burrito & a quesadilla with everything on it. Made them both a combo with chips & guac with one, chips & salsa with the other.

Took quite some time for them to be made, glad I had someone with me to talk to while waiting. 

Chips were okay; definitely tasted like bland packaged going-on stale.
Guac was also just okay; also tasted packaged with no flavouring. Barely even tasted like avocado.
Salsa was also just okay; would of liked at least some kind of spice.
Quesadilla was amazingly good. Very cheesy & cooked perfectly. 
Burrito was humongous; definitely need to bring a large appetite before ordering. 

Would come & eat again, just not waste money on the sides."}
{"text":"The service has always been friendly I've found.  However the quality of the burrito has gone down.  It's not bad if you have a craving,  but it's not the best burrito place out there.  Next time I'm just heading across the street from this place to the competition. (Literally - look south and a little west from this place).

I was not impressed that the meat in the ground beef burrito was barely there.  I had every other ingredient topped off to the hilt except for the GROUND BEEF in the GROUND BEEF BURRITO.

Not impressed.  Not going back."}
{"text":"Huge portion! I tried the fish but I like the steak a lot more. Also, you should totally try it with noodles! Was skeptical at first, but was pleasantly surprised it went so well in a burrito"}
{"text":"Nope.  Tried this for the second time and just can't get myself to like their burritos.  It takes forever to get your burrito ( the grill it on each side so you'll wait about 10 min). I tried the tequila lime chicken that everyone was raving about - not for me. It was sweet tasting (even with am the hot sauce and jalapeños) and barely had any meat inside it.  My boyfriend had the steak and same issue-barely any meat inside. Also his was leaking grease like crazy - he couldn't finish it. The guacamole was ok though and the chips were served hot.  I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Came here with my friends after school yesterday, and let me just say we were not disappointed. My friend and I shared a \"lil steak taco\" and omg it's literally heaven in ur mouth! The meat was soft and not chewy and they had a wild range of stuff to put in it.  The place is really tiny so you probably don't want to bring your whole family and dine in, but it would be excellent to take out. For a burrito thats pretty big for $10 it's worth it. Definitely recommend this place, if you are looking for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"My go-to spot for a burrito in this area (ok...the only spot for a burrito in this area). I've never had a bad one yet. Baked or Chipotle Chicken is my current favorite...have had the pulled pork and battered fish (solid) and the tequila lime chicken (meh, sauce is a little too sweet for my tastes but I can see plenty of people digging it)

1/2 star off for the price of chips and salsa at 2.99. Not horribly expensive but come on. Plenty of places give those for FREE. Would be nice to see some sort of combo price but hey, I know that's not up to the location/franchisee. 

Also, 1/2 star off for parking here on the weekends. Not a fault of FBB but rather the Flea Market nearby (I think...possibly the bingo?). The parking lot is JAM PACKED on weekend afternoons and evenings, and we're not talking a small lot. Weekdays is fine with plenty of spots right beside FBB. 

Speaking of the parking lot, in the summer months the smell coming from the dumpster (about 20 feet from the door) is horrendous. Part of me wants to say it'd be nice to have some outdoor seating...but I guess it would almost never get used. 

The prices of the burritos  are more than reasonable. You get quite a truckload of food for the price. The name absolutely fits the product! I usually go for a Big whatever, but the Lil would fill most people up quite easily.

Service at this location I've found more than nice. Have had a few good conversations while waiting for my food during not so busy times.  Upbeat, fun atmosphere. 

My review may be biased as there is a lack of interesting food choices in this area. Especially in that price/quality point that's a little nicer than fast food but not quite as expensive as a sit-down restaurant like Boston Pizza or what have you. Definitely need more joints like this in the area."}
{"text":"I recently ordered a butter chicken burrito at this location with everything except jalapenos, and it was the most bizarre burrito I've ever had. Normally, butter chicken is sweet, but in this case the butter chicken combined with the sour cream and the hot sauce created a strange combination of sour and spicy so unappetizing I felt nauseous. 


Service was good though, I called ahead to pre-order and picked up the burrito with no hassle. However, the taste of the burrito itself seemed like the result of a gimmicky filling executed badly and combined with far too many ingredients. Maybe I shouldn't have ordered sour cream and hot sauce to go with my burrito, but seeing as how they're essential to any burrito, I believe the fault lies with Fat Bastard for not thoroughly vetting their burrito fillings."}
{"text":"Three stars feels exactly right. I live nearby and visit sporadically. If it were the quality of Burritos Banditos I'd be saying I was a regular but it's just not that kind of good yet.

The quality of the food overall is decent. The quality of the meat isn't the best though primarily with the chicken. Passable for most but if you've had any good traditional stuff you can taste the difference. It's a few pegs above subway's microwaveable chicken but it still doesn't have that fresh unprocessed taste. And to echo a lot of past reviews AVOID THE COLESLAW. 

I tend to lean towards the battered fish & shrimp mix as their best burrito. Unfortunately for the smaller foodies it only comes in huge ($13).

The service is timely and most of their staff is friendly and careful about preparing your burrito. One particular member of the crew is mysteriously hostile when talking to men. Don't what that's about but on the bright side I see her the least.

All in all this is a nice on the run burrito place if you have 10-15 waiting on the prep. It's good every time but not great often.

If you want to find the best burritos in the city take your search elsewhere.

UPDATE: They now do the Shrimp mix in all sizes! (2015)"}
{"text":"Recently opened and right across from my work. Staff looked very young and inexperienced.......BUT I cannot blame them the day I visited. It was a hot summers day and it was 30 plus degrees Celsius outside with a broken air conditioner on the inside of this joint, so needless to say it  felt like I was visiting a sauna. After just a few minutes of waiting I was dripping with sweat. 

The young lady that was serving me was very friendly and had a bright, positive smile considering the working conditions. I ordered the HUGE chicken burrito $10.49. I added 2-3 toppings and she saw how small the burrito looked so she asked if I wanted more of the toppings that I had already chosen. Of course I agreed. She also warned me two times that the hot sauce is very hot and asked how many lines of hot sauce I wanted. I said one line was enough but it sounded like she was providing me with an illegal substance if you know what I mean :)

The person working the grill looked very inexperienced like it was his first time manning the grill but still he got the job done.

By the time my burrito was finished it had looked like a had finished a workout. I could tell which burrito was mine cuz it was the most obese burrito on the grill. 
No complaints with the food but just wish they had black beans instead of the brown beans. 

Solid 3.5"}
{"text":"They definitely serve fat burrito's here. The only thing they were missing was a guacamole add-on and more cheese in the burrito. Not sure if I missed it or not but i didn't notice there was an option for guacamole so I didn't bother asking. When compared to other burrito joints I still prefer Chipotle."}
{"text":"Fat Bastard's is okay, considering the limiting choices near St. George campus. It's a good place to fix your burrito craving.

The small burrito was enough for lunch... you have been warned. I got the tequila lime chicken (fried, of course), and it was fantastic. Loved it. The first scoop of guacamole is free. However, the service wasn't exactly polite. And I really didn't mean to, but I looked up and saw the lamps. The dusty lamps. Right above the (unprotected) food. Best not to think about that when you're enjoying your burrito."}
{"text":"I was really hesitant about this location because of its Yelp reviews, but was craving the tequila lime chicken so I bit the bullet instead. I did a take out for a naked burrito, and I'm quite impressed. The staff was polite and accommodating. I got a tortilla on the side (in comparison, Burrito Boyz charges $0.88 for that). While I'm disappointed that the naked burrito for the tequila lime chicken only comes grilled and not fried, I had an, overall, pleasant experience. The only downside would be the value; while this is standard for many burrito places, $10 is (in my opinion) too much for a small burrito. 

I'll definitely be back, and recommend the fried tequila lime chicken!"}
{"text":"I like things really hot, but this melted my face to the point of tears and numbness. I ordered the Lime-Tequila Chicken with shrimp and only got two pieces of shrimp.  I didn't get even half of what I asked to be in the burrito and the rice and chicken were disgustingly dry.  That was probably the worst burrito I have ever had and I'm sincerely disappointed someone would serve that to another human.  It's feels as though the cook checked out and decided to take me with him.  HORRIBLE."}
{"text":"My new favourite cheat meals. I had the baked chicken burrito and I want to try all of them so good and very filling worth the try"}
{"text":"Friday lunch time.  Had to get in on some take-out food and wanted to eat something I have not had in a long time... FAT BASTARD!

Went here around 12:20 PM and man, the line up was to the door.  It was crazy hot, busy here.  Whoa Nelly!  There was a ton of people waiting to order, waiting to have their food dressed, and waiting to have it grilled.  3 sets of people!

I was surprised that with the amount of staff, we did not wait that long!  i was thoroughly impressed by the fast customer service and the staff had smiles on their faces and were working hard to please.  Every order that was being done had a very organized sequence.  Hold on to your order number!

I ordered a BIG Ground Beef Burrito on brown with half the fixings (cheese, guacamole, tomato, rice, bean paste, chow mein, jalapeño, green onions, sour cream, little hot sauce).

I think I waited about 15 minutes and I blazed back to work.  When I got to my desk, I was really excited to get down and bite.  After the first few bites, I thought it was okay... but then when I got the middle where all the ingredients were mixing in harmony and whoa... totally delicious burrito!  It was amazing and I loved it.  Lunch was a complete success.  My order was so heavy and packing that I didn't even finish it.  It had to be a pound or more of food.  Totally raving about how delicious it was.  Most definitely am a fan of this place and would for sure return.  You go in hungry come back absolutely stuffed!

Thank you, Fat Bastard Burrito!!!!!"}
{"text":"Loved the option for imported Mexican Coke, burritos were excellent. Chips and guacamole could have used a bigger container of guacamole maybe next time I will ask for two."}
{"text":"Pretty decent burrito, but nothing special. Portions are smaller and more expensive than other better burrito places so I'd return only if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I have never been happier with a naked burrito than here at this location. However be forewarned that not all locations are this generous with their chicken. My favorite will always be the tequila lime chicken crispy I always ask for light on the sauce otherwise it's a little bit too goopy for me. The staff here are great and they know me by name and now my preferences are really accommodating. The chicken tastes very fresh I like that they put an entire piece in and then cut it up that way it Cooks better and isn't hard and tastes freshley made"}
{"text":"I've found myself coming here not too much for the food, but more for the convenience and the portion size. Besides Z-teca, the options are limited when it comes to oversized burrito places in the area.

Does that means the food is terrible?? Depends.....As many have noted the chicken is not the best pick. How they make it is by cooking a large batch of chicken and then adding a portion to a sauce pan with their respective sauce for each order. This method, although convenient, causes the chicken to be dry and overcoooked. I tried the buffalo and the sauce overwhelmed everything, it was similar to eating rice with a ridiculous amount of hot sauce.

The beef however I find pleasant, its not dry and pulls apart very well. They are usually generous with the meat as it covers the entire box (I get the naked burrito). Similar to Subway, they add ingredients based on your preference. Guac is included in the price, however not exactly the best tasting. You can add beans, rice, or noodles (well that was a first) followed by the assortment of toppings.

The portion size is big and after mixing everything together this taste is pretty good. Would I order the chicken again?.....nope."}
{"text":"It's pretty good.  I had the fish burrito.  Not sure what type of fish they use but about an hour after eating it, I had to run to the bathroom. :("}
{"text":"I must say my family and I were disappointed with a couple of things. The burritos were too salty, the service was too slow and the person behind the counter seemed to not give a s$it. We will be giving our business to Z Teca next door. Their burritos seem to be a lot tastier and the service is WAY faster."}
{"text":"When it's good, it's good -- but the inconsistency absolutely ruins this place. If the owner is working, you'll get a decent-sized burrito with good-tasting ingredients. However, if you happen to come here when certain employees are working (usually evening or weekend), you will get the rudest service with the most awful burritos. Prepare to be served with cold attitude and zero smiles; attitude when you ask for more than just a pinch of noodles (get real - i'm paying for a BIG size, so give me more than a baby size); and terribly small portions. I'm constantly left feeling ripped off and like my business was not appreciated one bit. Do yourself a favour and visit the competition down the street (clue: ends in a 'z') or a couple of other Fat Bastard locations. The couple of stars is for the owner being nice and giving good service. Other than that, you lost my business."}
{"text":"Full disclosure, I've never tried any burrito chains so I don't really have anything to compare it to other than Taco Bell and Mexican restaurants. Since it's a chain and pretty cheap, I wasn't expecting a lot but I was still disappointed. My bf and I came here after the Yelp event for the premiere of Snowden. We wanted something fast and filling and if Stoney's wasn't already closed, I definitely wouldn't be writing about my subpar experience now. First off, the parking lot is weird because it's a very narrow space you have to get in to park in front so we parked at K+B Sushi next to it since we were getting take out anyways and they had spots. The girl who built the burrito didn't wear gloves and I thought maybe it was because the tortilla was already on a metal plate thing but then the guy who was grilling the burrito also didn't wear gloves and turned/wrapped all the burritos with his bare hands...I still ate it but definitely raised an eyebrow.

On to the food. I got the \"lil\" baked chicken burrito with a bunch of toppings - I like how you don't have to pay extra for guacamole but they put so little in there, it might as well have been nonexistent. My bf got the ground beef burrito in medium size. I wasn't impressed with the flavour as it was quite bland and I didn't actually hit chicken until about halfway into the burrito. It was all toppings for a while and I didn't end up eating about a third of it, mostly because I just didn't want to eat it anymore. My bf's burrito had all the jalapenos grouped together and unfortunately, one of his mouthfuls was pure jalapenos (they don't take the seeds out either) so he ran to the fridge for milk and proceeded to sweat for about 15 mins. All in all, it's edible and a good deal for the amount of food you get but I don't think I'll be going back, at least to this location."}
{"text":"I come here all the time because it's super quick and easy.

I usually order the baked chicken burrito bowl, this is more like warmed up frozen chicken that is a little watery while still being dry as a result. It's your average burrito fare with the refried beans, rice and veggies (they also have egg noodles...SOOOO GROSSSSS....soggy and super greasy, so opt out). The veggies are mostly fresh and fine. The hot sauce is SUPER SPICY - which a lot of people underestimate.

This place gets super busy during the weekdays at lunch time, but turnover is pretty quick."}
{"text":"Love the service here.  I've been to a few of the other locations and this one meets and exceeds all customer service needs. Friendly, patient, funny...do I need to continue singing the staffs praises...I think you get the picture. 

They have 3 sizes of burritos; Lil, big and huge!! 
I ordered the shrimp burrito, a big!! Cause I got a BIG appetite. 

As usual it was delicious, they even added some more noodles..oh they have noodles btw. Yumm! Where was I? They added noodles cause I didn't want some of the toppings. Wohoo! Other fat bastard locations would never do that! 

Alright back to enjoying the remainder of my yelpin' long weekend. 

Cheers"}
{"text":"I went a few weeks ago after a good workout, and I had heard from a buddy of mine that Fat Bastard Burrito was a great place.

I ordered a large Beef Burrito, with black beans, vegetables, the sauces and cheese. I got into it, and it was good, but as I was eating it, it started to taste more and more like my mother's meat loaf. The beef was alright, it could have been better.

So far I have only had Mucho Burrito and Fat Bastard Burrito, and I must say Mucho Burrito had better beef. This might change as I have to try Burrito Boyz."}
{"text":"A tasty enough burrito, Fat Bastard's ingredients are not the freshest, and meat fillings are pre-cooked.  I'm really finding the tendancy of TO Burrito joints to have pre-cooked meats and fillings a disappointing one.  

The guacamole was tasty enough, thankfully, but the salsa selection seemed under whelming. 

The overall package was decent enough, although it was not wrapped up quite perfectly, falling apart in the last quarter or so.  

Fat Bastard  is not quite close enough to my work to make it a regular trip, but it's good to know it's there."}
{"text":"Portion size and also quality seem to have decreased. 

Also received multiple wrong things in our order and when I asked where missing items were they scoffed.

The rice was undercooked and had a funky taste to it, lettuce seemed a bit off.

Not one of the better burrito restaurants in the area"}
{"text":"This place FILLS you up! I got a Huge Burrito and it was CRACK. I'm visiting Toronto and loved it. I don't get why this place has negative reviews..."}
{"text":"Although I live right next to this place, I've only been here twice. The first time was just to try it out the week they opened. It wasn't very memorable and I just found it really expensive for what we got. We could have gone to a sit down Mexican on King for the same price. 
The second and last time I went there I noticed something I hadn't noticed before - the lack of hygiene. They use their bare, gloveless hands to prepare the food. Neither do they use utensils in lieu of any gloves. What made it worse was both the cashier and the burrito preparer were on their phones and handling money and everything else without washing their hands before preparing our food. In the day where most restaurants require everyone to wear gloves or at least wash their hands between money handling and food preparation, I found this unacceptable and haven't gone back. Frankly, the food isn't worth it."}
{"text":"Growing up in the San Francisco Bay Area, Mission-Style burritos are something that have a tendency to make me less homesick. And luckily, due to their popularity, you can find them just about everywhere, thanks to a number of different chains, Chipotle being my usual favorite in the US.

One of my other Toronto Yelp friends checks into Fat Bastard fairly often, so I checked their site out, and resolved to give it a try the next time I was in town.

Their menu reminds me very much of a very tiny SF chain called 360 Gourmet Burritos, which took the standard burrito and expanded the repertoire to include things you'd normally not see, and that's what these guys do. You want butter chicken with noodles instead of rice? That's what these guys will do, should you be in the mood for that.

This place is pretty tiny, with not a ton of seating, but quite a bit of parking. That gives it the atmosphere of the kind of place you'd actually find in The Mission. I decided to go for the featured burrito, which was a Red Ale Fire Chicken. Lee ordered a Tequila Lime Chicken.

Being a Dumb American, I had a little bit of a hard time understanding the guy at the counter, but luckily he was patient with my stupid american face and we figured out what I wanted.

Their setup is a little bit different than Chipotle (for those who are familiar with that chain) in this case, you order all the stuff you want in your burrito and  then they heat it on the grill. This has good points and bad points. 

The good: Mmm toasted tortilla. This gives it a distinct flavor, that nice nutty taste you get from a quesadilla. 

The bad: It takes longer than a place like Chipotle, where they are able to expedite your food along an assembly line. Here, you have to order and wait. It's mostly a minor quibble, but I can imagine on a really busy day this can be a huge bottleneck.

Some other points and thoughts. I really love that they have refried beans. Refried beans are the best. However, I wasn't a huge fan of the chicken, it was flavorful, but it was also overcooked and dry. This was the case with mine, and with Lee's. I would probably avoid it and get some other meat next time.

There was something a little overly sweet in both of our burritos that I couldn't identify. I thought that it was perhaps the marinade in mine, but when I tried Lee's, he had a sweet taste to it as well. If I could figure out what that was, I'd avoid it as well.

Prices are good, I find them to be comparable to Chipotle, so you're going to pay about $20 or so for two people with drinks if you get the Big size.  The thing is, when you are buying a burrito that size, you are going to be satisfied and full.

Overall I give them 3 stars for a standard chain with nothing that was incredibly remarkable, but nothing that was horrible. I'd definitely visit again."}
{"text":"I would give 5 stars if that old lady would be friendlier to people and not make a huge burrito turn magically into a lil burrito by holding back on the toppings. But seriously this place is awesome. Everyone is super cool just don't get the old lady to serve you."}
{"text":"Had a quick lunch here before a Holiday Monday Movie (Jason Bourne). Chose the Buffalo Chicken Burrito. It was pretty good but not great. Had them add lots of a Buffalo Sauce, which I love. It would do in a pinch but I wouldn't go outta my way to go again. PS the 2 guys that were working there were pretty good."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this joint for years. This is my go to place for my burrito fix. Fat Bastards Burrito uses the freshest ingredients and their protein is seasoned perfectly. I find other Burrito joints lacking in this area. Anyway, the burritos range in size from Small, which is about the average \"shawarma wrap\" to Huge which is about 2lbs with all the toppings."}
{"text":"I gag thinking about this place.  The burritos are soggy and meh.  The employees seem like they just don't care....and they act this way while standing over the prep area where they assemble people's food...eating their own food!  Vomit!  I am pretty sure that this is the worst and dirtiest location I have been to, since I have been the Liberty Village location and it was not like this.  So sad to be on such a busy street and serve such low quality product.  Never again."}
{"text":"WORSE LUNCH EVER... Just went to pick up a shrimp burrito bowl for lunch and it was the worse EVER! It was freezing cold, things weren't mixed, there were like 4 shrimps and soo little lettuce.  The staff didnt look like they knew what to put in... I usually love the bowl at Chipotle's and Burrito Boys'... this was a very poor version... Will never eat there again."}
{"text":"I used to be a Burrito Boyz kinda gal, but after eating here a few times, I'm sold. Fat Bastard Burritos are the clear winner for me. The meat is good quality (not all chewy and shredded and gross like some other places) and staff is super friendly!"}
{"text":"I love this burrito place, the staff is very very nice and the food is amazing. I would recommend trying the yam burrito it's excelente"}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place in Mississauga, (maybe because of the name) so went for lunch with my son. He ordered a fish burrito and I got a fish taco. It was tasty but a bit spicy.  They have a good variety on their menu. I saw pad thai in a wrap, had not seen that before.

The sitting area is not too big, just a few tables, found it really messy, people had eaten and left their mess on the table. We just took our food to go."}

My husband had the beef burrito and it was the same problem. Ask for rice and you might get 1/4 cup.  They are very skimpy for add ons"}
{"text":"We came here to grab a quick dinner and heard good things about Fat Bastard being better than Burrito Boyz (wrong btw). This location is right across from a Burrito Boyz and I had decent expectations. However, they food is overpriced for the size you get - i finished my small naked bowl in about 5 minutes and I usually never finish my food. They are also very stingy with toppings and sauces - myself and others in line included had to ask to add more of everything - they barely sprinkle anything unless you ask for more. The service was also slow and the food itself tasted like it lacked flavour. Chicken was dry 

I would not be back"}
{"text":"This establishment seems to be plagued by Yelp trolls with insurmountable appetites and small budgets who think this is the venue for complaining about logos.

Now it's not every day that you come across $9.43 so you must spend it wisely. I selected the big pulled pork burrito with everything on it. And it is huge...I'm still working my way through it. It is also delicious - noodles and all. Had I wanted more toppings so that I don't have to eat again for 3 days, the ladies working efficiently behind the counter were more than obliging.

So well done FBB, despite what your deranged critics say. You make good food and I am happy to pay you money for it."}

This place checks off all my boxes - tasty hot sauce, guacamole at no extra cost, refried beans and, strangely, chow mien noodles? Seriously, don't knock it 'til you try it. Available in both burrito and bowl form. Eat 'em up, kids!"}
{"text":"I had lunch today at this Fat Bastard Burrito Co.  I love burritos and have had them from other Fat Bastard locations and liked them.

It was REALLY REALLY cold in the restaurant.   I kept my coat on while I was eating and my toes honestly were freezing.  Not a comfortable dining experience.

I ordered what I always get ... a chicken burrito.  I ordered a \"big\" burrito, which is their medium size.  It seems like cold is the theme here because though the outside of the burrito was grilled, everything else was cold ... the rice, the beans and the chicken ... and they shouldn't have been.  I was tempted to ask them to heat it in the microwave but I wasn't sure how it would turn out.

I won't be back!"}
{"text":"Gord and I love love love burritos and have been waiting for Fat Bastard Burrito to open in our 'hood for a while.  It opened on Thursday so we stopped in this afternoon for a late lunch/early supper.

They have a selection of burritos, quesadillos, poutine, etc.

We both ordered a big baked chicken burrito.  The different between then is that his had lettuce and mine had tomatoes.  And it was big!

They were tasty (though lacked a bit of a kick) and the price was right ... we'll be back."}

It seats just six people on stools along the window and I managed to grab a spot in the corner.

I ordered a big (which is their medium) chicken burrito with rice, beans, cheese, salsa and burrito sauce.  It was jammed with chicken and rice, which was great.  But because it was so jammed with stuff, it was kind of dry ... next time I'd ask for extra salsa and burrito sauce."}
{"text":"We went to Fat Bastard Burrito in Liberty Village for a late lunch today.

Gord got their feature ... a big chicken bacon burrito and he said it was good.

I hadn't had breakfast and was starving so ordered a huge chicken burrito, figuring I would take what I couldn't eat home.  Well, I ate the whole thing ... and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"I have been to other Fat Bastard Burritos locations that were very good. I recommend this to a friend and I was embarrassed since the service was so bad! The cashier was rude, they were very stingy with the ingredients compared to my experiences at other locations such as the Queensway location and Woodbridge location. The tables were also dirty and they really should work on training their staff to be friendly with the customers."}
{"text":"The service could have been a little better however there was a good variety of toppings for your burrito. They are very satisfying......go for the small!"}
{"text":"I found Fat Bastard Burrito to be very disappointing. My husband and I went in and ordered a beef burrito and a bean and cheese burrito. I found the bean and cheese burrito to be bland and lacked authenticity. As a Latina myself, I don't expect perfection from a \"fast food burrito\" location but I did expect better than what I received. The hot sauce that was added was very spicy, but not in a flavorful way, only in heat. My husband ordered the ground beef burrito and also disappointed. There was only a small amount of beef inside the burrito and was also bland. 

Service was good, you can watch the Non Hispanic staff attempt to make Hispanic food. But the staff was friendly and prompt. While it was not inedible, I doubt we will be returning."}
{"text":"I went to the Fat Bastard Burrito on Adelaide St. The restaurant is decorated in a typical fast food decor.

I ordered the huge roasted steak burrito. It was a typical burrito. You get to choose your toppings and the burrito taste okay, but not as good as Chiptole.

Would I go back? Maybe if I am in the area."}
{"text":"Came by here because i had a hankering for a Steak burrito.  Ordered a large burrito cost about 10-12$ overpriced off the bat.  Hell if i paying that much it better be good. As he prepared the topping for the burrito i ordered the usual topping with a line of hot sauce.  Noticed the person setting up the burrito really really went stingy on the guac i was like really???? You can get a harvey burger with Guac and they murder your bun with guac straight murda like they put a scoop of ice cream on your bun.  Ne ways brought the burrito home took a bite it was a very salty burrito like really salty. Consumed 2 bottles of water to dilute this meal.  Very disappointed to spend that much and find it to be really bad.  The steak in the burrito look like a pulled pork meat. Terrible first and last time going there for me.  Damn you Fat Bastard i had high hopes for you.  Step your game up. Like step it up big time.  I rather go to subway or the BK beside you before i try it again. As well paying that much should be a good meal. Juat saying drop your prices if youre serving that stuff."}
{"text":"Really can't say a bad thing about this place, this specific location has a bathroom...so I prefer it to say some other spots...cough cough Queen West and Yonge near College...no push button door into a broom closet, actual space here and the food rocks."}
{"text":"I love Tex Mex and the addition of a few good restaurants within the Eglinton E area is a definite bonus as to what was offered before. The place is a bit small with high bench seating, decent music and clean front of house. However, serving area was really messy with bits of everything all over the place, so if you have allergies of anything, this might be a place to be cautious in. Some of the servers talk way too softly and it's hard to hear anything they're saying.

I ordered the big baja chipotle chicken and ended up getting kfc style chicken fingers with some baja sauce + toppings , this was my first BFB so I was unsure as to whether this is normal so I didn't really say anything. The use of a flat top grill seals everything in well just like other Tex Mex places serving the same niche market. I also watched them prepare it after the toppings selection and I saw someone in the back clearly remove 1/3 of the chicken portion and put it aside (to be used elsewhere).

The food was good, but I clearly had mixed feelings with my experience and I will only go when I'm looking for something different from the competition across the street."}
{"text":"Sometimes a place can have decent food and pricing but when the service is exceptional, you just gotta recommend people to come by and this is such a place. This is a decent burrito place and when I dropped by with an extremely drunk family member, they helped us out with the mess he made and offered everything we needed. They went above and beyond what was required and gave us the best experience possible!

Go for: a simple and easy-going burrito place with exceptional service 

Don't go for: non-mexican food"}
{"text":"Although their service (specially the male cashier) leaves a lot to be desired, the burritos are always great. The tequila lime chicken or roasted chicken can be a bit salty at times, but it hits the spot. I find their hot sauces unbearable and numbing (not such flavor just too much heat, cannot taste anything afterwards). 

We always get the pulled pork, carnitas or tequila lime, and guacamole is decent too"}
{"text":"I don't frequent Burrito places but noticed here on Yelp there were two right across the street from each other in the neighbourhood I was in.

I opted for Fat Bastard because of the positive reviews of the Tequila Lime Chicken and figured I'd give it a try. 

The physical size of Fast Bastard is not that great. There were about 10 people ordering/eating their orders in the customer area and it felt full. To move around you had ask at least three people \"excuse me.\"

Ordering was straight forward and I watched as the couple in front of me - also noobs - asked for help deciding and the cashier was extremely helpful, walking them through the different options, what certain things mean and the like. I was also impressed when they were putting their toppings on a lá Subway style. The assembler explained what refried beans here and what ghost pepper is. I was quite impressed as it seemed everyone else knew what they were doing and I expected a bit of soup nazism to radiate from behind the counter as it was taking longer than the average order.

My burrito was amazing. I loved the flavour of the chicken. The burrito itself was wrapped tightly so I could eat it with one hand, the whole wheat shell had been grilled so it was soft and crispy at the same time. Man I really loved that burrito. About half way through I had plans on ordering another one for the road but by the time I finished I was full! Not bad for $10.

While the staff was friendly I did find a few things peculiar. When your order is ready to be dressed with toppings they call our numbers. I'm not sure how I was supposed to know my number was on my receipt - and it's not printed any larger than the other text on the receipt. I also found the assembler spoke ultra fast and expected me to anticipate her questions. She had to say \"beans and rice\" to me about three times and finally pointed at them so I knew what she was asking.

\"Ohhhhh, you're asking me if I'd like beans and rice on my burrito - yes - yes please!\" was my internal voice.

They had a selection of some neat soft drinks there outside the regular Pepsi/Coke lineups and while I didn't get one on this trip - they offer deep fried mars and snickers bars! A funny UK style treat to find in a burrito place but definitely yummy!"}
{"text":"Too big in size.
Like the idea of Mexican Asian fusion.
Noodles in a burrito is good but beans don't match with it.
Hot sauce is good."}
{"text":"I told myself I wouldn't go back to a burrito place after not knowing the exact ingredients in the tortilla. But I decided I did not like or want the dinner I packed for work. I was going to go the extra distance to get New York Fries but I decided against it. Needless to say, I made a mistake.

From the moment I asked about the tortilla I knew I was screwed. They seemed annoyed that I was asking about the tortilla ingredients and reluctant to even give a proper answer. I had to ask them to check the package which they should have done since they didn't know the ingredients for sure. Universe forbid I had a deadly allergy and decide to just take their word for it. 

Onward to the burrito making. I had zero idea that the veggie burrito came with sautéed veggies. I remembered after, that an employee usually asks if I want sautéed veggies. So imagine my surprise when I only asked for 3 ingredients and take a bite to find peppers. Again universe forbid I was deadly allergic to peppers. When I let them know they seemed annoyed by me and I'm pretty sure talked badly about me to another customer in line. 1. It's not on their menu board that the veggie burrito comes with sautéed veggies. If I was brand spanking new to the burrito world, this would have been a major problem. I happened to forget since that was my second time at FBB. 2. Every burrito place I've ever been to including a Fat Bastard Burrito on Eglinton has asked me more questions about what I wanted on my burrito. 

I should have turned back when I realized they had no black beans. I mean, what burrito place doesn't have any black beans. I realize I went there at 9pm so it was pretty late. But food places are supposed to account for the future and how much food they're going to need. They should have had black beans no matter the time. 

So one tiny burrito that cost about $9, sautéed veggies I didn't ask for, and a realization that they didn't ask if I wanted hot sauce (all places ask if I would like hot sauce) later, I super regretted even stepping foot in there in the first place."}
{"text":"Very much meh. Decent size portions, but the meat quality is sub-par (I ordered a chicken bowl) and the toppings are mediocre.

They do get extra credit for offering noodles instead of rice."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place. The sauces is what makes this place. Ask got extra sauce, it is worth it. The meat is good, but not great. They do allow a lot of customizations. Plus, they have a gluten free option which helps with my niece... She devoured the burrito."}
{"text":"Crazy buzy all the time I have gone. Good food, good prices,  lots of parking. Best for take out. Sizes of portions are crazy large."}
{"text":"All the other nearby mexican places were closed on sundays, so I just decided to give this place a shot despite the questionable yelp reviews. I havent wrote a review in a while but this place really pushed me. Just fyi i got roasted steak.

1. The big burrito is not fat or big. Its a regular sized burrito at other mexican places. So its basically calling medium big just cuz they feel like it. 

2. Its bad. Like its pretty bad. I am so surprised that this place is a chain. Like why do people go here often enough that it is still standing on that real estate. The steak was horribly dry, they skimp on a lot of toppings (not that they are great). But just think a very dry burrito with not much flavor.

Overall, it filled me up and... it filled me up. Thats not why you eat out or get a take out."}
{"text":"I normally go to the Mississauga location; Dixie and Burhamthrope (northeast corner).

Happy to see one when I was in the neighborhood.

I ordered a Lil' Sautéed Shrimp and Veggie Burrito.... with Rice, Noodles, Pico De Galo, Lettuce, Little bit of crunchies (crushed tortilla chips), Extra Guacamole Burrito Sauce and Spice.  Love it!!!

My friend ordered the ground beef with same topping minus guacamole and with cheese.   She said it was very good."}
{"text":"This place is just a mess. I've been to other FBs in the city and this is by far the least enjoyable one of their locations. The service is slow and unfriendly. It doesn't look very clean. Go across the street to Burrito Boyz for a superior experience."}
{"text":"Music was blasted so loud it hurt my ears - didn't stay longer than 3 minutes - didn't even order food and left."}
{"text":"first time at this location. They place was clean with allot of staff working. I think some of the staff were in training and our order took a really long time. When we did finally get it, we were pleased with the taste.
Will go back again and see if the service is faster, which would bump it up a star."}
{"text":"I have been to some of the other locations but this was the first time at this location. The place was clean and staff were friendly. I ordered a huge shrimp burrito.got everything on it I requested. And sat down to wait while it was cooked. I had it to go when I went to open it up less then 5 mins away and took my first bite I noticed the burrito was stone cold no melted cheese even the shrimp tasted cold. I was defiantly not impressed and will prob go to the warden locations next time. I did go back and they remade a new burrito for me and made sure it was hot this time thnx."}
{"text":"No soy option for veggie burritos, and serving size is incredibly smaller when compared to chipotle or burrito boyz for the comparable options."}
{"text":"Always good.  Consistent.  Been here at least 20 times over the past couple of years. Depending on who is making your food you need to watch the toppings.  Some are very cheap, others are generous."}
{"text":"Hands down the best burrito place in Toronto. Always tasty, always fresh and at a great price for the massive portions!"}
{"text":"Fat bastard is a great name for this place because that's what you will become once you try it. The tequila lime chicken is amazing, but so is the fish, beef and literally everything on the menu. Don't forget to add crunchies which elevate the experience. Staff is always friendly as well. Truly five star."}
{"text":"This place is such a hit and miss depending on the staff that work here. If you don't want to make burritos, don't work in a burrito place. I have had some good burritos from here, but more often than not the employees try to rush though everything and end up messing something up. Adding lettuce when you say no lettuce, giving you tried chicken instead of baked. Overall, this place is ok because there isn't much else around but could be substantially better."}
{"text":"Update - Aug 2015 - 

I just wanted to say that I go here once a month atleast. It is still one of THE best burritos I have had. Definitely crave worthy. 



I am not a big burrito person and have tried the most popular chains more than a few times. For me, this is the best there is. Their burritos are very addictive. There was one week where I went 3 times!! Everything I have tried has been very good. They have great sodas and their hot sauce is so good!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here late on Saturday night for a beef burrito. The people working were friendly although the service seemed quite slow. The burrito was huge and tasted great but I'm still feeling a little.. ugh.. 2 days later. It was a lot of food- decently priced and a convenient location and I'm a sucker for punishment so I'm sure I'll be back but most likely will avoid unless I have couch time in my near future."}
{"text":"Delicious burritos and lives up to all the other restaurants in its chain

Has opened up recently 

I went there and enjoyed eating a nice steak burrito with all the toppings. 

Great place. Hope it survives the area because there are a lot of good options there."}
{"text":"Visited the Fat Bastard Burrito yesterday with a friend while strolling through Parkdale and trying to find some food. It was the only place that drew our attention with its small interior and the box crate store front. I've tried those Habanero chips they sell before, and they were good so we thought, why not!

Let me warn you about the sizes. \"Big\" is in fact VERY big. I am terrified to think what their \"huge\" size is like but next time I'm getting the \"Lil\". I got the pulled pork but \"Naked\" which was one of their options - meaning, no tortilla, it comes in a box. Beans, rice, quacamole, peppers, coleslaw, cheese and salsa are the toppings I chose. All the veggies were fresh and tasty, though the guacamole tasted a bit like it was sitting there too long but it wasn't too bad.

The pork was very very tasty. Tender, not too sauced and there was a LOT of it. I got through most of it and was bursting. As I said already, portions are very generous.

My friend got a sauteed veggie burrito and it looked tasty too, it was stuffed with all the toppings and flat top toasted to crispy. She enjoyed it as well.

I may come back to try the other flavours, they had a good selection and I like the fact you can get it without the tortilla. Thumbs up from me."}
{"text":"went here after a night out. i got the fish tacos with came with 3 tacos. i got my order pretty fast. the fish was flaky and had a nice crunch. the size of the actual fish could have been bigger. the fish sat on top of a mixture of salsa + lettuce which i thought was good but too much. good place for your money"}
{"text":"Not impressed. I have been to other Fat Bastard locations and this one can not compare.
I had the 'Pulled Pork' Burrito, and they obviously pulled most of the pork from it. There is nothing worse than having a burrito that skimps, or reduces the meat toppings. I get that companies want to save money, but I would rather pay extra for a superior burrito, than
feel like I am getting ripped off. My advice, if you are craving Mexican, avoid this joint as
there are better places just up the street on King and and on Queen...Over priced, small portions of meat, and average service, they are lucky I gave them 2 stars..."}
{"text":"3.5?

I'm confused about this rating...I'm not a huge fan of the name of this place but was with friends and they really wanted to try it so I said why not. The store is clean with minimal seating. Went for a weekday lunch and got a spot with no problem. 

I wanted to get something light in calories...is that even possible for a burrito place? Looked at the quesadilla and it seemed to be a good option. You get to choose your toppings and type of quesadilla or burrito - so I like the customizability of the menu. 

Opted for a Veggie quesadilla...but they made me a burrito instead? I was too hungry and the line was too long then for me to go back and say my order was wrong. I also ended up paying more than the cost of a burrito but whatever. 

The burrito was huuuuuge, and quite tasty - hence why I feel the rating is close to a 4. I really liked the flavours and it is quite filling. I've never had a burrito like this. In my opinion it's comparable to chipotle and possibly even better. 

I'll probably go back at some point. The taste and portion size was pretty good!"}
{"text":"The place is horrible and do not try the fusion bbbbbbbbbbbbbbb gikhchbbbkkkjjjbcxxxcv"}
{"text":"Its refreshing to get a new food spot at my condo. The lines are never too long. The staff are friendly but move a little too slow. 

I have been here about seven times. I have ordered the battered fish burrito, chicken burrito, steak burrito, pulled pork burrito, chicken quesadilla, chips and guacamole. The only burrito I recommend is battered fish. Everything else is really dried out meat regardless of if it is the morning or late night."}
{"text":"Tasty, fair prices, good portions, good service.

It's quite small in there though so take note if you want to eat in during a busy time you might find yourself without a seat."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place. We used to order from here at least once a week. Used to! That all ended when we placed an order that didn't come for more than an hour. We had an early morning flight, it was my idea to get takeout so no dishes, no left overs festering for a week while we were on vacation. What a horrible idea. We called the restaurant three times inquiring about our order before they offered us half off. They requested we ask the driver to call the manager when he finally go to our place. The driver complied, YELLING over the phone to the manager at 12 am in the hallway of our condo building. I was so embarrassed. 

We vowed never to order from them again and haven't. I think this only happened because we ordered through justeat.com and didn't tip them through that, I'd rather tip the driver in person but apparently that puts us in their shit list. Glad I didn't tip before hand.

I will go to other Fat Bastard Burrito locations because the food is very delicious and at a good price, but NEVER this one."}
{"text":"I'm very disappointed on their burrito portion. For over $11, I'd expect more. Hell with that price at Chipotle I'd get way more than Fat Bastard. With that name Fat Bastard Burrito is more like Little Bastard Burrito.

I ordered the Huge Specialty Roasted Steak. Found out that the roasted steak is shredded and to be quite honest there's no taste, unseasoned, and blend. Yuk!  The one and only thing I like about here is that they don't charge guacamole whereas Chipotle do. 

I've been having good meals for three weeks but this place has to ruin it."}
{"text":"Staff are nice, and quesadillas/burritos are usually good. Sometimes pulled pork is dry, and the salsa is average, but that's about it. Pretty good place to get a burrito when I'm lazy."}
{"text":"I've had some good experiences there before. They have some creative menu items for a burrito place. HOWEVER, last week I ordered their new Sweet and Spicy Tofu burrito. I told them I don't eat dairy or meat which they understood, I watched them add the toppings and thought everything was cool. I got back to my office, started eating it and realized after a few bites that it was full of ground beef!!! I don't eat meat, so I was really pissed. I went back and showed them. They believed the cook added the wrong filling, even though the receipt clearly said TOFU. The staff was very apologetic, and they gave me my money back, but still. I really didn't appreciate a mouthful of beef, which I haven't eaten in 10 years."}
{"text":"I should start by saying I HATE burritos. These burritos however have noodles, tons of meat, everything yummy and in perfect portion to each other. Non of the typical tons of rice and beans thing going on there. Oh, and the fried Milky Way, just do it!"}
{"text":"Just Ok, in my opinion. A large specialty burrito, chips, salsa, and a drink will run you around 15 bucks. They really cheap out on the salsa, thus making the chip to salsa ratio very one sided leaving you with plenty of not so fresh chip and not enough salsa. Sure, the burritos are large, but the shrimp one I had wasn't really that tasty. 

There aren't any real burrito options in the area though, so if that's what you are craving then this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Good food and friendly service.  I had a ground beef burrito and left plenty satisfied.  On the wall they have a picture of Gordon Ramsay standing outside the restaurant, so if he likes it, it has to be good!"}
{"text":"After reading a few of the lower rating reviews I understand why it has a low rating, because they ordered the wrong thing. Chicken Tacos? quesadillas? lol Thats why theres a taco bell down the street. 

On the wall theres a donkey that says EAT BIG OR GO HOME. most likely you'll go home unless you get a Big or Huge Burrito. I came here with the expectation, im going to get the biggest, and fattest burrito, and lemme tell you I got that. I got a huge, fish battered Burrito and that was a 10/10 hands down, the best burrito Ive had in my life. 

I got the rice and noodles and everything else EXCEPT the bean spread, because I've had a bad experience with beans from other joints so I stay away. I got it to go and this thing was HEAVY, I was worried it was just going to crack in half. Got home and everything was still intact which was a plus. The fried battered fish was on point, crispy on the outside and flakey on the inside. and Believe me I was completely full and couldn't move after

The only advice I can give is try the Fish Battered Burrito you will not be disappointed... thank me later"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time bought the fish tacos for 9.99 you get three of them. could've had better portions of fish but I tasted pretty good"}
{"text":"I went here while visiting from out of town and I don't really understand all of the relatively negative reviews.  You can get a very large burrito for a very reasonable price here and they also have a wide variety of meat and flavor combinations to choose from.  I enjoyed their creativity on their menu, but went with a traditional chicken burrito and thought that everything was fresh and flavorful.  The only tip/mild complaint I would give is to be very careful with the addition of their homemade hot sauce, because it is extremely hot and they didn't really let me know that beforehand.  Regardless, it was still a great burrito and I would have no problem coming back here next time that I am in town."}
{"text":"Delicious barrito. I went here for lunch and got a ground beef barrito. The taste was delicious and the barrito was grill perfectly. Nothing too special though."}
{"text":"The best selection of toppings anywhere. Tons of different types of meats, noodles, chips, cole slaw, etc. So yummy! They are huge! The hot sauce is extremely spicy but the workers warn you. SO delicious. The best burritos I've ever had, every time I go!"}
{"text":"I love fat bastards, but recently, the burritos have felt pinched. Typically happens when the same employee (don't know his name) is loading it up with ingredients. Regardless, the meat portion is consistently cooked well and generous. 

Please keep our burritos, and stomachs, FULL."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place at least a 4 but too many factors limited that from happening. 

First off the staff are awesome so friendly and so helpful. My husband took me here saying it was better than the boyz. I doubted this very much but was eager to see if it was possible. I ordered the tequila chicken crispy. Hubs had the buffalo chicken. The vast amount of toppings was impressive. Two things that struck me... the noodles and the tortilla chips.. intrigued I told em to go ahead and put everything on. 

Took a while for the burritos to be ready but we were in no rush. All good. 

The thing was massive and as heavy as a brick. 
First impressions... my tastebuds were confused. 
And just as I was taking this first bite this scary looking man walks in and litterally it becomes tense in the space. I become too focused on whether he's an armed gunman and were all going to die with burritos in our hands. We cant focus on anything but the conversation between the terrified burrito maker and this frightening creepy man. Finally he leaves and we can all breathe again. 

I wish I could have enjoyed my burrito instead of thinking of exit strategies and what my last possible moments  on this world would be like. I have to commend the dude behind the counter for keeping his cool and loading the dudes burrito up with everything. Because of his bravery and impeccible burrito making skills we all lived. 

From what I remember of the burrito... I left very full. My husband had to help me finish it. I also did not enjoy the noodles in my burrito.  I felt like I was eating chinese food in a wrap. I also didn't care much for the chips as they had become soggy and not crunchy. What I did like was the tequila lime chicken and how much chicken they stuffed in there and the awesome crunch.  If it wasn't fried and instead just grilled I would not have enjoyed it. 

We also had the Mexican soda which was meh. Im not a big soda girl. Overall this was good but I likely wont return to this location out of fear for my safety.  And next time no noodles."}
{"text":"BIG BIG Burritos!
If you come here, you better be real hungry, and prepared to be blown away by those little Torpedos!
The place is clean, spotless, hipped and trendy-looking. The guys behind the cash and line are cool as well, and professional and energized.
It is my first visit to the Fat Bastard, and most likely will not be the last.
You get to choose from a big list of different flavours and sauces, if you add up everything you want, it'll turn into a real big bad boy that's heavy to lift and finish, it's challenging.
Easy with their Hot Sauce, don't act too macho like I did!"}
{"text":"Best burrito in the city in my opinion. Love the buffalo chicken. Love the noodles and other ingredients"}
{"text":"First off, this place is a Burrito Boyz style of place.  I'm not saying this is good or bad, that's just what it is.

Pros:
Fast and super friendly staff
Fat Bastard burrito sauce
Fresh fillings and lots of them (I couldn't finish my medium size burrito)
Spicy actually means spicy
Small amount of parking right in front of the place.

Cons:
The burritos are grilled
Over grilled burritos, mine started to crack and crumble when eating it.
Nothing significant really makes this place unique compared to other burrito joints
The pork in my burrito was cold and not reheated enough
A small amount of seating along the window, grab and go!

#1 thing to take away from this:
Get the Fat Bastard burrito sauce.  It's creamy and delicious!"}
{"text":"It was good, until I realized how much hot peppers were in it and Noodles!! Who puts noodles in burritos? I didn't even ask for it! It ruined my whole burrito. Because of that reason, I wont come here again.. I got the battered fish burrito with everything in it. Some parts were enjoyable, most parts were unedible. I recommend,  Only if you keep an eye on what they are putting on your toppings. I've been craving for a good burrito/taco.. but I know where to go next time to get.. and it ain't here. They are decent, not horrible and not that good either. Okay."}
{"text":"I thought Burrito Boyz was the only good place to satisfy my cravings for a hearty and belly-warming burrito/burrito bowl, but I realized that I was wrong once I tried Fat Bastard Burrito. 
Came here after some word-of-mouth. Barely noticeable due to its small sign and small restaurant. I entered to realize that this isn't a place you can sit and eat, since there was literally 4 seats available by the bar table facing the window. 
I was overwhelmed by the variety of options they had. After spending what felt like 10 minutes of contemplation, I finally opted for the small butter chicken naked burrito, while my brother chose the tofu burrito. The server then asked whether I would like my chicken baked or fried, which I thought was a nice option to have. They have 3 burrito size options, where the largest one seemed to fit the restaurants name perfectly.
The size of my meal was decent for a small. First thing I noticed was that the huge variety they offer on their menu is basically ready-made sauces, which they drizzle over a regular chicken. 
Now for the taste. The butter chicken was delicious! I loved every bit of it and the butter chicken sauce helped preventing the baked chicken tasting too dry. My brother loved the tofu and said that he prefers it to the soy from Burrito Boyz. We also bought their chips, which comes in medium, hot and xxx hot. Obviously I chose the xxx hot and let me warn you, after one bite your mouth WILL be on fire (speaking from someone who can handle a lot of heat)! It was awesome.
The following week we went again, with an aim to try everything in the menu at least once, so this time I chose the tequila lime chicken. One bite later I and realized that this may end up being the only choice I'll want from now on! Tequila lime was too amazing (a chilli lime flavour), better than the butter chicken! 
Price for this place is similar to Burrito Boyz. and service was friendly. 
The only thing I hate is that they only have one location in Mississauga. 
I still love Burrito Boyz, but I may have found a new favourite."}
{"text":"Fat Bastard Burrito opens till 4am on Fridays and Saturdays!! It is the best thing I had at 3 am after couple of drinks (1,2,3,4,5,6.. ) on Queen West.

The lines seems to be long, but the friendly staff are just so efficient and it took around 10 minute for my order to be ready after I customize all the toppings (love the selections! noodles, cilantro, jalapenos, guac and more).

I really enjoyed the Battered Fish Burrito ($8.99) and Baja Chipotle Chicken Quesadillas ($8.49) I ordered to share as the after crawl snacks. Good value, tasty, fast and filling! 

Fat Bastard Burrito definitely my to go place for some comforting food after a night of drinking on West Queen West!

I love Fat Bastard!

P.S. no photos of the food because I was hungry, because I was drunk, because it was 3 am.. I just want to eat the damn thing!"}
{"text":"I got very mild food poisoning and would not recommend this place to anyone who values eating burritos in the future. Extremely plain meal."}
{"text":"My partner and myself had ordered from fat bastard burrito tonight he had the butter chicken and I had ordered the tequila lime burrito chicken that wasn't breaded as I have allergies and need to know the oil that is used to cook breaded foods. When we got home we found that are order was not correct. I had a breaded chicken in my burrito which I couldn't eat that had a chipotle sauce of some sort. My partner had his butter chicken but all the sauce was on the opposite side of the burrito then that chicken making the side with the chicken dry. I understand it being a holiday but it seemed as though the staff were rushing along trying to get out early instead of listening to what we wanted to order. When I tried to call the store to see if we could have our order remade or refunded there was no answer. Usually we receive fairly good food from here but lately the staff seem rushed and inattentive."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a run of the mill burrito then come here. There honestly isn't anything special about them- toppings are typical other than the noodles option. I wouldn't recommend their chicken as its really dry. HOWEVER, if you are feeling adventurous and like fish tacos. Then look no further. By. FAR, the best menu item. Super hidden gem of a menu item. Fish tacos. Take note. You're welcome."}
{"text":"Went to Fat Bastard's various locations including Toronto and, most recently, the Vaughan location. Although the restaurant itself is quite small with limited seating, it works due to their quick-service/take-out philosophy, serving as many people as possible. The menu is quite diverse, with burritos, and their new taco flavours that they started to advertise inside their restaurants. I ordered the BBQ Pulled Pork Burrito and oh my was I satisfied. I usually order a large burrito because, of course, it's me. They bring unique items compared to other burrito places like noodles, chips and all sorts of sauces that will stimulate your palate.

Would definitely visit again, and again, and again!

4 burps out of 5."}
{"text":"They're fine. Not great, but they have only made me sad I ate there once, when I foolishly ordered \"pulled pork\" thinking they were trying to translate carnitas. They were not. It was like southern barbecue pulled pork, the burrito was awful, and I wanted to sob my way back to California.

If you aren't from California, I'm sure the selection of meats and toppings is pleasing. If you grew up eating Mission Burritos IN the Mission, don't go here. The basic chicken is fine but not really anything like back home; I think it is literally JUST baked chicken, not seasoned. I don't know why I have to wait for my burrito to be grilled in this city, but apparently it's necessary. I have gone here because they were close to work and had a moderately less racist logo than other nearby options. I don't think I'm giving them a third chance.

Service: average. Nothing amazing but no complaints.
Food: average. Nothing amazing. Not authentic, but it doesn't taste BAD if you know what you're ordering. The refried beans are actually decent.
Price: average. No more than other burrito options in this city. The Big burrito (= small burrito from El Faro/El Farolito in SF) is fairly filling, but you won't go into a food coma or anything."}
{"text":"(oops found just found this in my drafts from a while ago - forgot to post)

*refer to picture*
Not exactly sure what happened in the burrito-making process but I somehow ended up with a minuscule 3-bite size burrito, and unfortunately I didn't realize this until I got home and the drive back to complain is too far and not worth it. I think they gave me the wrong order because #1) I did not ask for green onion, and 2) there is literally no other toppings but green onion and beef. I don't think I can even call this a burrito."}
{"text":"I love it here. It's a place where I can get a satisfying meal and so can my meat-eating family members. Lots if vegan options including yams."}
{"text":"OMG I love their cheese quesadilla and pulled pork burrito.  I will never use Uber Eats again, something really weird going on with them, but my new food delivery app see's me ordering from here an awful lot.  Great food.  The new location I get from however often forgets the Sour Cream and Salsa that us supposed to come with the quesadilla and I can't find a way to order extra sour cream or salsa otherwise they'd get a 5."}
{"text":"From the star rating on this place, it seems to be getting a bad wrap (pun not intended) but my experience today has me confused as as to why. Sure the price was a little steep for how much food I got (a small sweet potato, bean, and cheese burrito bowl for $10 tax in), but I figure thats a bi-product of steep financial district rents forcing prices up to make rent and pay staff. 

Service was friendly, food was very tasty and a great mix of flavours and textures. Vibe in the store was sorta meh but it was 2pm on a Wednesday and snow-storming outside so again, maybe a bi-product of circumstance. Plus, this is largely a takeaway and delivery spot so vibe is less important anyway."}
{"text":"Never thought I'd call Burrito Boyz \"quality\" but, Fat Bastard's makes that happen! Just bought a \"fish burrito\", worst choice I've made in a while. All batter. 
Mouth left really greasy, lots of creamy saucy crap going on, not fresh/healthy tasting at all. Just yuck.
Got a fish burrito. Thing is, there was no fish. Batter burrito.
This was the burrito of McDonalds, it seemed."}
{"text":"Was interested in trying one of the FB'S specialty burritos. Walked into this small location, a few stools by the front window to sit but otherwise predominately take out. 
They were helpful and let me try a few different sauces to taste, nice touch. I settled on the tequila lime burrito, she had suggested I take the baked chicken (instead of fried?) because it would be more tender, I agreed. 
The burrito was loaded and well stuffed and heavy as i would expect it to be. It tasted very good but it was not like the tequila lime burrito that I was hoping for and tried at other locations. 
The chicken was soft combined with the extra sauce they added, it was a soggy mess that was overpowered by a sweet sauce rather than the subtle tequila lime taste.  
Overall, great place for a burrito but I find they use too much sauce which throws off the fresh taste and authenticity of the burrito."}
{"text":"Warm lettuce and cold chicken. Ordered Baja Chipotle chicken and got cold dry chicken drenched in bbq sauce. Only had 4 choices for toppings too ?! Literally the worst ever. 3 bites and threw it out. Humorously Terrible."}
{"text":"I've already been here four times and my favorite is the Pulled Pork.  It is tasty and sweet.  The staff is nice and are shocked when you don't get a big one and act like a FAT BASTARD."}
{"text":"Only ok.  I've had better food elsewhere.  Liked that you can tell it's real meat but otherwise pretty bland and tasteless.  For so many people working there the food seemed to take a long time to prepare.  Atmosphere was so so.  Limited seating and poor use of space.  Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Burritos are small for the price. Quality is just a OK, very average. It wasn't bad but nothing to rave about. 
Location is convenient to grab a quick bite before the jays game. I would not go out of the way to get here though."}
{"text":"Sooo good!! Love the yam burrito, the way they fry it up is really good compared to other burrito joint even some of their other locations are as good as this one. It's almost always busy so calling ahead is definitely a good idea"}
{"text":"Staff is nice, great layout for the store. Two TVs and also sells Blair's chips. The dude helping me was intricate in handling my burrito which was sweet. Guacamole is $1 extra. They've framed their reviews, have deep fried marsbars and sport a butter chicken burrito to intrigue. You won't be disappointed because you will be FULL! Good place to spend extra bucks when Johnny's Hamburgers is busy next door."}
{"text":"This place could rival chipotle and gives Z-Teca a run for it's money.  Definitely the most innovative one yet! I had the butter chicken burrito and it was amazing. I love he different assortments of toppings like a subway style of adding almost everything you want or need. I would hold off on the hot sauce as it makes the burrito a little more watery then it should. Just load up on japlenos for the same kind of fire! Can't wait to come try something new at my next visit!"}
{"text":"This is an honest post. This location is SUPERBLY over the top for customer service( which makes me happy). I live near by and I always used to grab burritos and quesadillas from this location always. 

Since the change in ownership, I've felt that the burrito quality has gone down significantly and just the taste of everything is just disappointing, gross and sadly, bland. All the meat on the menu are dry and tasteless (except the lime chicken) and sometimes cold. Beans are not flavourful and overall, it's just a hot a$$ mess. 

Went there this evening(may 14th) grabbed 2 burritos and super floppy and still tasteless. Ended up grabbing burrito boys from skip the dishes.

Guys, please please fix this. More flavour and warmer burritos=more customers. Simple math."}
{"text":"Let me preface my review by saying that I've been a loyal FBB customer for a number of years and have been to numerous of their locations around the city. My review, although stemming from an incident that occurred at this location is in large part focused on FBB corporate for their mishandling of my initial complaint.

Several weeks ago I popped in to grab a burrito as I'm used to doing on pretty much a weekly basis. Not that it really mattered to me at the time, but the girl working the cash and the guy preparing my burrito seemed very unhappy to be there and not thrilled that they had to prepare one more burrito for the night. The guy rushed me through ordering my toppings and slapping my burrito together. The real trouble however began when I got home and took a bite out of someone else's burrito - one loaded with cheese burrito sauce and other toppings I can't eat. They had handed me the wrong burrito. I immediately threw out the burrito and messaged tHe FBB Facebook account.

The seemingly very junior marketing person on the other end promised to \"make it better\" and told me the franchisee would be reaching out to me via email. I gave them my email and after a week of not hearing anything, followed up. They responded saying they would \"remind him again\". A week after that I followed up again asking if this was some kind of joke? No response, and of course no email from the franchisee.

Here's your 1 star FBB. One you could've very easily avoided."}
{"text":"I've gone to Fat Bastards for a few years and have always loved it.  However, the last few restaurants I've been to have been horrible.  My biggest complaint is the portion sizes - they are very small in comparison to the way they were before.  

I recommend not wasting your money here as you'll leave hungry."}

{"text":"Definitely beats Burrito Boyz across the street hands down. Better flavour, more generous toppings, better zip in their hot sauce. I recommend accepting the chips and noodles, no matter how weird you think it may be.

I will say their baked chicken, like so many other burrito places, is a touch dry. That said, it's still delicious and I get a craving for one of these burritos often."}
{"text":"There's nothing less to say about this place other than the fact that it is hands down the BEST burritos i have ever eaten! If you haven't tried Fat Bastard yet you are totally missing out! A group of us in our car group meet here every single Thursday because it is a great hangout, the staff are awesome and friendly and really know how to treat their customers, not to mention know how to put together a mean burrito! The menu has a great variety and portions are great for the pricing...once again if you havent eaten here already you have no idea what you're misssing!"}
{"text":"I'm from Southern California, so I know good Mexican food. I was excited when this place opened up across my lab, but it is not a good burrito. It's a wannabe Chipotle burrito. The burritos drip too much, and they get the meat wrong. It is a good deal for all the food that you get, but there are plenty of better Mexican food options just a ten minute walk away in Kensington."}
{"text":"Update -- 

I'm quite disappointed in the toppings lately. My once huge l'il burrito is now very small in comparison to what they once were to when they first opened. 

Disappointed."}
{"text":"A+++ service and great, fresh food where they don't skimp on toppings. We moved an hour away and still come back when we can."}
{"text":"arrived here after a night of partying and was extremely hungry. 

I ordered the ground beef burrito. The process was quick and the burrito was not only fresh but HUGEEEEEE. 

The ingredients were fresh and you could taste it. Will definitely return. Worth every penny in my books!"}
{"text":"I grew up in Halifax, Nova Scotia, so my taste for authentic Mexican isn't always on point. In fact, sometimes I crave ground beef smothered in sour cream and veggies, and this place will do that for me sans judgement. 

Their burrito sizes are true to their names, which some people see as a con, but not I. If I ask for a small, I mean a small, I do not mean something the size of my thigh that will inevitably half end up in a waste bin. The toppings run the gamut from expected: guac, salsas, rice, and refried beans to the unexpected: noodles, butter chicken, crunchies and more.

Two can easily dine for about $15 and when you're hungry, it's late and you're on W Queen W, this place can have you eating in 10 minutes or less. Long live the bastard!"}
{"text":"Wasn't quite sure what my bud and I was doing but I know we were hungry.  We were making our way to a place and then I remembered that Fat Bastard opened up a while ago off Beaver Creek  Suddenly, wanting a mid-east wrap became wanting a Mex-Wrap or a Burrito.

Dropped in and picked up a couple of items.  I opted for the small jerk chicken one and my bud went large with this lime chicken thing.  There was one size even larger.  If you saw what the small looked like and then the large one, you would think the next size up would be called \"Hell No!\" 

The Burritos are well stuffed and then grilled before enjoying and ask for the heat...it's better that way.  What is a burrito without heat?  A wrap from Pita Pit....LOL!

The establishment was a bit weird when we stepped in.  No greetings from the guy, just a stare.  I thought for a moment, we walked into a place that was closing - or Toppings Pizza and Burger (you have to read my review on them to understand my comment).  Once we got past the unexpected unpleasantness, we got to order the food.

The place was a bit messy - maybe because it was end of day and final clean up wasn't happening yet.  Dunno.  I guess we're here to get food and not enjoy the scenery.

I ended up taking a series of pictures and posted about 4 of them.  My napkin pictures shows up as their company photo.  If you have an iphone, it shows that my photo was put up by the business.  If you use any other device, it drops to other pictures and eventually shows that it was my picture.  Not sure what is going on.  Had a conversation with the owner and it's not his fault but I'm a little miffed at this bug in the system.  Oh well.

A repeat place?  Yes.  I like this brand better than Barburrito, Quesada, and the like.

Cheers."}
{"text":"The rating system on Yelp is spot-on. \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" I got the Big Naked Burrito (bowl) with ground beef. 

Now, you think noodles looks interesting right? Wrong. Don't get it. It's just a no-no. Bland noodles have no place in your dish. In the end, the dish was just bland; the noodles were just one part of the blandness. Compared to Burrito Boyz and Chipotle, this place should definitely not be charging higher prices for subpar flavour and size. Service wise, everything went smoothly, but the food was just...meh."}
{"text":"Food is ok but the service is pretty hit or miss. It was actually pretty bad tonight."}
{"text":"So excited to see that a location has opened up in heartland mississauga.
I like this even better than burrito boyz, which is also pretty good.
And they're open till midnight on the weekends. 
For people in mississauga, who haven't tried this, you should try it"}
{"text":"I ordered the \"Big\" Steak Burritto, the steak portions are very small 3 scoops to be exact and $2.50 for a additional 1 scoop. The steak was flavourful with a roasted taste, but my \"Big\" Burritto looked small. I asked the lady working the counter for extra hot sauce and she replied $1.00 extra. 
The place is located in a nice plaza, and Fat Bastard Burritto is amazing, only at this location they are very Cheap on toppings, and can improve on the customer service."}
{"text":"Been here once, I had a steak burrito and it was quite good. My girlfriend had the fish option, which I had a bite of and let's just say that's what I would order the next time I go. Wish there was a bit more seating, but I'll excuse it because the portion size is generous."}
