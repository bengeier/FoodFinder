{"text":"Food is just OK, but the service is another story. Don't come after 12pm because there is practically nothing left to eat. I'm here with 12 people and we barely had any food to eat. We asked to bring some hargow and sui-mai, but still waiting. Guess we have to go and eat somewhere else"}
{"text":"There was an advertising coupon from ccue.ca for free Peking duck (additional $8 for lettuce wrap) if spend over $40 before tax. So we decided to try it out. Orignally we wanted to order a set dinner for 4, plus the duck. The lady said she hasnt seen this promotion and seems unreal, so she went to consulted with the Manager. He came, he looked at the print out of coupon and suggested us to order something else aside from the  combo because it considered as special price already. That's fine. We chose something else. Before he left our table, he confirmed that the coupon is ok to use as long as we order $40 or more. So we ordered something else with another lady, when we were ordering, this bossy staff stands beside us and checked what we ordered. Once we are done , the bossy lady took our coupon away and said she wants to double checked with the boss. So the boss said the coupon was misprinted and they wouldnt honoured the coupon as it is impossible to have free Peking Duck. Their inhouse promo is to add $18 for the duck. They will need to talk to ccue.ca. But then we said just now the gentleman manager said it was ok to use and the coupon was publicize on a website, in Canada, you should get whatever you see. They deny and keep saying they can't honour that coupon to us and ask us to pay $18 extra. We then asked then how come the manager agreed to honour the coupon?  He came after then he denied what he just said. We told him you just confirmed how can you deny now?  The story is, it's not that we can't pay that extra, but it is their staffs who agreed then forbid their agreenent. So disappointed.   Despite above, the food is too oily. So unhealthy. Most of the food we need to use tissue to absorb the oil before eating. Also, the overall dishes are just mediocre."}
{"text":"came here at 10am to take advantage of $2.80 for S/M/L dim sum dishes this morning and was a little disappointed at the selection of dim sums.  things were moving a bit slow and carts were repetative during that hour.  had to wait till 11am to start to see the good stuff roll out.  by that time, was pretty filled up on the so-so stuff.  quality of food was pretty average, nothing to exciting.    most restaurants will have special dishes or signature dishes that they are known for, but this place did not really have anything special.  desserts were limited as well.  maybe it is me, we got a table at about 10:05am.  by 10:20am, our sheet was at 14 (dim sum) already.  keeping in mind, it was 2 adult and one little kid during that 10+ minute gap LOL   i think i eat too fast and too much.    will i come back... yes.  next time around, will wait till about 10:30 to come and should be more happy than."}
{"text":"I think the city of York food and health safety should pay a visit to this restaurant. I saw a green pass sign hanging on the front door, but it wasn't anything near clean. Food is mediocre ( wonder how clean the food preparation is ?). Stay out of the men's restroom, very dirty. Smells of men urine, not very attractive at all."}
{"text":"The restaurant got a lot busier after 11am. Dim sum quality is average. The food selection is also average. The price is affordable, six of us paid $15 per person."}
{"text":"I am always a fan of dim sum and even the thought of it brightens my day, but the customer service my friend and I received this time around was absolutely crappy.   We had been seated in a wobbly table located in an area where it was difficult for the carts to come by and show us what they were serving. Reasonably we asked if we could switch tables and by the 2nd inquiry we were promptly called out by an employee dressed in a grey dress suit and high ponytail for \"preventing her from serving other customers\". Another employee dressed in a black suit along with a waiter literally gossiped behind our backs for \"being uneducated and having no manners\", simply for wanting to be served properly. They even charged us an extra $2 because they had to wash an extra tablecloth when they could have brought it over from our previous table.   Thoroughly unimpressed that I just had to make a yelp account and leave my two cents. Also, watch out because they don't even de-vein all of their shrimps."}
{"text":"Although the food in here is not bad, it is not that great either.  Please customers beware, aside from charging $1/per person for tea (even though it is on the same pot and just filing it up with hot water), I found out too on my bill that they will charge you $1 for the table cloth.  This place is getting ridiculous.  If anybody out there who know a nice dim sum place, please let me know as I am sick and tired of this place charging you for everything.  Their pigs internal organs too is so small a portion.  They probably not buy these stuff and yet they charge a lot for it."}
{"text":"Quality of food is going downhill, especially for dim sum. There is better dim sum place around the area with that price. Dishes for dim sum is getting smaller and smaller. I personally will not spend that much time lining up for this kind of lower quality of food."}
{"text":"Didn't have the dim sum. Which is one of their specialties... But try the Yin Yun Fried Rice if you want something different!"}
{"text":"The prices are super reasonable! $2.95 weekdays with mid afternoon dim sum at $2.60!  Weekends are $3.20 for most items. This place is very old school complete with little ladies pushing carts and calling out specials. For non-Chinese speakers you can ask to peek into the bamboo steamers before ordering. The decor is a little dated but that didn't matter to our party. The food was hot and fresh and that's the most important."}
{"text":"I and my friends have never been treated so badly by restaurant staff because we didn't speak Chinese. My friend arrived early and when he asked to reserve a table, he was told in ENGLISH, that his name would not be called because it was not Mandarin or Cantonese. Come someone please explain this policy?! Second, we were repeatedly ignored by English speaking serving staff because we didn't understand the Chinese names of the dim sum. Okay, you don't need our business, I get the message. Finally, we only got to eat after one of my friends got up and stopped the lady with the cart and began to open up dishes. That is beyond disgusting! We're never going back. Shame on G & O and anyone who supports this ignorant behavour."}
{"text":"Came here once because all the other dimsum joints were packed.  We must've came early because surprisingly the place wasn't as full.  It's not disappointing.  It tastes like all the other ones I've been to. There wasn't really anything that stood out."}
{"text":"I live nearby but haven't been here in years. Every time I came for dim sum before it was a 45 min wait and the food was good (3.5 stars) but not amazing but worth coming back too.  We had a large multi-table family dinner here in spring 2016 and the food was decent, 3.5 stars.  This review was out visit on September 9th. It was 12:30 and the place was not crowded at all.  We started off with the white egg noodle like wrap that has beef inside. You pour soy sauce over it. That was good. It was hot and tasty, again not blown away but it was standard dim sum fair which averages 70/100 on my scale.  We were a little full so decided to have squid tentacles, siu ma, and hak ko and that would be it. All these three came from the same cart. None of the dishes were hot. The pastry on the hak ko was dry. The shrimp did not look fresh and eating it was completely underwhelming: little flavour, bad texture. The siu ma was worse. There was some sort of after taste near the middle. Instead of the reaction being \"mmmmm\", it was I hope this doesn't make me sick.  The squid was lukewarm. It was yellowy and not what I was expecting, but for what it was, it should have been better. It was too rubbery and very meh.  This might be the worst dim sum I ever had. It is certainly the worse I can remember. Since, we've been reviewing restaurants on yelp, this is the worst meal I ever had and the worse that I can remember, so it was a very memorable experience.  The 4 $3.20 dishes with tea and tax and tip ended up being $18.  If I'm invited I would come here but I would not voluntarily choose to eat here again.  Maybe they had a bad day and it was not representative but we had a very bad meal."}
{"text":"I can't even imagine my life without Ginger & Onion.   This is my parters family favorite restaurant and they have been going here  weekly for YEARS. Since I have been adopted into the family we make the weekly trip to Ginger and Onion ourselves for my absolute favorite Chinese Food in the GTA.  I usually order some of the less authentic dishes, (Braised Bean Curd and Mushroom, Ginger and Spring Onion Lobster & Sweet and Sour Fish with Pineapple being my favorites) But my SO's mother has ordered and insisted I try some more intimidating treats. :)  The best part of the whole meal is the dessert, Tofu-Fa which is one of my favorite things to eat in the world, and G&O does it best.   For value, they bring a (pork bone?) soup as the starter free of charge.  To be clear, I don't speak a WORD of Mandarin (except \"thank you\") and I have a Canadian name. I don't have any problems ever, and the staff is always friendly.   They do have specials listed in Chinese characters only on the walls, but they have an English menu too. There is a specific menu where a large selection of dishes are $9.95 each."}
{"text":"The good,  Decor is nice. A modern looking chinese restaurant w/ creams walls, dark walnut wood panels, hanging monochromatic artwork and spot lighting.   This place features some excellent dim sum not typically offered:   The baked custard sago with red bean center (rare to find) and the crispy taro dumpling (best I've had anywhere). Also they had some hot dessert soups and stews, not common.  The bad,   Push cart dim sum service was terribly slow. By the time the cart makes it around to your table your item may not be available any longer.  It happened a couple times to us. Would be nice if they implemented a, a la carte tick off menu plus push cart the most popular items to increase efficiency.   But anyways.. we will give the the place another try some time in the future as it offered some different choices."}
{"text":"There's not much dim sum restaurants you can see servers push 'dim sum carts' to serve food. This is one of them.  Food is not bad. But I highly recommend DO NOT order 'shrimp wrap'. Taste doesn't taste shrimp at all but very fishy taste. NEVER order again.  Worst was they charged us wrong price. We ordered around 7 dishes (around $2.50 / dish) on top charge per person. We supposed to pay around $25 with taxes but was being billed double. We went to the front cash and she told us it's computer error.  Now, the question is, 'what if we didn't catch it?\" Funny thing was my dad told us this restaurant also make error on the bill. Everyone, WATCH OUT!!! (Golden Rule : Always check the bill before pay...not matter which restaurant!!!). Good luck!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent and reasonable Dim Sum place. Food is very good, and there is a lot of variety with all the push carts. Price is reasonable. Come early or else you will spend a long time waiting as this place is packed during lunch time."}
{"text":"I would actually like to give this place 0 stars but am forced to click on one star in order to be able to post my comments. I looked up Ginger and Onion and it looked like a decent choice so we went last Sunday early afternoon to have dim sum. We got seated after waiting over 20 minutes. Once seated I asked for water that never came.  We sat there without any food for over 40 minutes. We looked around and saw one lonely cart at the other end of the restaurant. Many people had empty tables just sitting around waiting for food.  It was absolutely ridiculous so we got up and left.  We wasted over an hour starving and left without any food and experienced terrible customer service.  Horrible first impression. Obviously, we are never going back."}
{"text":"(aka \"Ga Yan Gung\")  This is my go-to place for good, authentic dim sum for a great price.  If you must go on a weekend, make sure you get there before 11A.M., otherwise you will be right smack in the midst of the \"Dim Sum Rush\"...on a weekend, every Chinese family, their YeeYees, GungGungs and PoPos will be crowded around the entrance, eagerly awaiting their number to be called.  Classic!  Of course, I always get the usual suspects (Pai Gwat, Siu Mai, Haa Gau, Cheung Fan, etc.).  Sometimes I get the curried octopus (forget what that one is called in Cantonese!!).  The Tofu Fa is one of my favourites, although it seems to have a teeny bit more ginger than at other places.  All-in-all, if you want to take your family and/or friends to an authentic Cantonese Dim Sum restaurant, you definitely can't really go wrong with Ginger and Onion.  (As an aside, I have no idea what will happen to this restaurant once the razing of Market Village begins.  I hope they open up somewhere close-by!!)"}
{"text":"Did not enjoy it at all! Went here bc of the reviews and honestly have to say will not be back! First if all the place is disgustingly dirty. We went @ around 3pm  and the place was empty. There were 3 asian customers seated in the centre while us and another non asian couple was seated next to the bathrooms and dirty dishes that were left on the carts. The place looked as if it was in midst of renovations as well as a party on the other side. The fish tank was dirty which was killing my appetite as I was sitting right across it. The ladies bringing the food had gloves on however they were rolling the dirty carts and stuffing food in their mouths at the same time which im sure with the same gloves. Needless to say I came home and was sick! Never again!"}
{"text":"****3.5 STARS******   This was only the second time I had ever had Dim Sum. We orders a variety of dishes including the shrimp dumplings,chicken bun,fried squid,and egg tarts. YUMMMM!   Everything was truly tasty and I like the consistency and thickness of the dumplings here and they did not fall apart when I picked them up.   The ladies bringing out the food in the traditional push carts were nice and not very pushy when trying to get to pick their offerings.   The ambiance here is also pretty loud and vibrant and its such a treat to have Dim Sum in a traditional setting.   Overall a good experience and I definitely want to come back for more. Maybe my rating will go up as I try more of their dishes (Their desserts specially looked yummy).   Our bill for all the dishes we had was very low ( less than $30.00) and I noticed as we left that a crowd was starting to gather at the entrance, so I guess this place is pretty popular and tends to get very busy.   Thanks to my fellow yelpers for introducing me to the deliciousness and fun that is Dim Sum!!!!"}
{"text":"Decent dimsum & service (not as rude as most Chinese restaurants - which I can say since I am Chinese lol). Good variety of dimsum, can get kind of busy/noisy but I don't mind/am used to it. :)"}
{"text":"I was in toronto for a weekend and I wasn't happy with the dim sum in chinatown. It was very americanized. This place was better. They had variety and it was decently priced."}
{"text":"This restaurant is definitely categorized as CHEAP eat. Great for large groups. Don't come here if you want fine dining, but, if you want to appear as if you have tons of money and want fresh fish, Peking duck, lobster, rice, seafood soup, vegetables and dessert - all for around $100 for 12-13 people, welcome to Ginger and Onion!  Intro. I read some previous reviews and they mostly are about the Dim Sum, but I am writing about Ginger's dinners. The one thing that my family ALWAYS gets is the Peking duck, because it is so cheap here. For $25 bucks, you can get a Peking duck, and if part of a dinner package as mentioned above, you can get all the seafood luxury fixes and trimmings for so a very non-wallet-breaking price (it really bears mentioning again and again). At LTH, the Peking duck alone will cost around $50 bucks.   But is the food really any good?  Food. This restaurant is like a mass production facility, churning Peking ducks by the table. Ginger and Onion obviously makes their money by quantity. The quality is hard to explain...the food is not bad but it's not out of this world either. I don't eat the Peking duck here because it is mostly fat and it looks too greasy for my liking. The Pork and Squash dish is covered in thick corn starch sauce, yet it is my favourite dish. I don't touch the lobster nor the fish as I am not a big seafood person, but these really are popular; every other table has the seafood platters. The food is heavy, often smothered with heavy sauces, but at the end of the day, the meat tastes like meat, the lobster tastes like lobster etc...etc...  Ambiance. The place is a bit older, and some might find the appearance on the dirtier side. As I mentioned, not fine dining. Service is actually not bad, efficient where it needs to be. Take note of the white boards on the walls near the fish tanks where they list all the specials (most of them for only $6.00!!), but the catch is only one special dish per table.   FYI. Reservations are recommended because this place fills up so fast."}
{"text":"So so dim sum but they definitely deliver on quantity.    Worth re-ordering:  beef balls, chives and shrimp dumpling, BBQ pork puff, pork dumpling (siu mai) ok dishes:  shrimp dumpling (har gow) cause the shrimp wasn't tasty and the wrapping was way too sticky and thick, rice crepes over fried dough (Zha leung), the dough was not crispy and the rice crepes were too thick."}
{"text":"So disappointed :(  After such a great experience at Sam Woo's, I expected Ginger and Onion to be fantastic as well.    Service was abrupt, unfriendly, and hurried - no smiles.  Food - meh meh meh - a lot of the dishes were cold and uninspiring.    Bathrooms - icky!  Not sure why this place was packed."}
{"text":"This is an ok restaurant with reasonable prices. I used to come here pretty often, both for dim sum and dinner, with my family when everyone was just too busy/tired to cook. Just had dinner here last night.   The dim sum here is average. Nothing spectacular, nothing horrible... ok for the price. If you value quantity over quality, then this restaurant will be fine.  Their e-fu noodles with eggplant are quite good, as is the rice with chicken feet and rice with sausage.   As for dinner, the peking duck, once again, is slightly greasy, but decent. Also, don't ask them to prepare the rest of the duck as a separate dish-- it does not taste good, and is a waste of money. I quite like the lobster here- not too overly seasoned, or too bland, and pretty fresh tasting. The casseroles and hot pots aren't that good. We ordered some tofu once and it was horribly bland.  The fried rice is mediocre... I've had much better at Graceful Vegetarian on the other side of the plaza.  The complementary desert selection used to be better. And the soup... isn't really good at all- too sweet and MSG-y. But I won't complain... it's free after all.   Overall:  Nothing better. Food is quite cheap. Large portion sizes. Sometimes it's good, usually its decent, and sometimes the food is just bad- depends on what you order. Too much MSG is used, and the food often tastes greasy, especially the fried food, which is slightly soggy rather than crispy.  However... the service isn't that great sometimes. The staff isn't the friendliest... not terrible, but doesn't meet my expectations. We're rarely greeted with smiles... and sometimes the servers ask us to help them clear the table... without saying thank you. Maybe I'm being overly sensitive about etiquette, but isn't only polite?"}
{"text":"**For weekend dim sum only**  Be prepared to wait - I have never been here when there wasn't a mass of pushy hungry people waiting for a table. Table of 2 is by far the shortest time to get seated. I like coming here since it is one of the few places left that still do carts. They have a good spread of dim sum items but the popular ones will sell out fast, which may require you to take your receipt up to the cart for pick-up (Yes, I'm one of those people). During holidays, they will have special menu items such as oysters or crab-claw balls (yum). Prices are very affordable and it was recently renovated (No plastic tablecovers here).  You can expect your service to be fast - everything/one seems to move so fast paced (great turnaround time).  Best to keep requests/questions, if any, simple if you don't speak Chinese.  I had a hard time asking for a ginger ale once. Maybe should I have asked for 'Canada dry' instead?  Tip: tell the hostess to call your number out in English if you do not understand Chinese."}
{"text":"This is a family favourite. Great place for Peking duck, which is sliced thin but with tender meat. During today's dinner, the lobster was small but flavourful. The fried baby bok choy was very clean and tasty. We also had an interesting Chicken and Squash plate. For dessert I discovered a Sesame-based sweet soup which was quite nice."}
{"text":"Ginger and Onion Cuisine outside of Market Village is one of the old style dim sum with the pushy carts.  This place tends to get super busy and the wait time can be over 1 hour easily.  You should make reservation during the weekends for sure.  Dim sum is not bad and they have some of the older dim sum that not much places have anymore like the classic sponge cake in the steamer I used to eat when I was a little kid and the giant deep fried ball which is amazing.   I been here for dinner a couple times too and it is def cheap.  Peking duck combo is so worth it and was good too.  Lobster is good as well and the size is decent.  You get free soup of the day and dessert like most Chinese restaurant if you get the set-meal. The place is a little dirty for my liken; the chairs are nasty as I wore a white shirt and I leaned back it instantly put a black mark on it.  The dishes, spoons, cups and bowls are kind of dirty too so you should inspect it before using them.  Pricing is good but do not expect luxury dining at Ginger & Onion Cuisine.  Rating:  Service: 3/5 Food Quality: 3/5 Comfort 3/5 Decor  2/5 Value: 4/5 Parking: 2/5"}
{"text":"Definitely a solid place for dinner, good set meals, food is decent. A nice Chinese place where the tables aren't TOO close together so you can move. Staff is decent, like most Chinese places - not overly nice but not rude. We enjoy the set dinners that come with lobster, fish, etc.  On numerous occasions, we've gotten a number of set meals. The meal depicted was for 6 people, came with lobster; crab; steamed fish; 2 dishes of vegetables; chicken and something else. All their dishes were actually pretty good with the exception of the crab. Which was smaller and slightly over salty.   HOWEVER, I would say do not come for dim sum. We had a horrible experience AND the food was not good. We arrived for early dim sum (around 10am); there was no early dim sum price and food came out so far apart that we were ready to go because there would only be one tiny plate of food on the table every 15 minutes. Food quality for dim sum was also not superb. They had one dish that was killer. Which was a huge fried dough ball (jian dui - ??) covered in sesames; but it only comes out every 45 minutes to an hour and if the ladies strolling the carts start on the other side of the room and don't make it to you - too bad!"}
{"text":"Ginger & Onion offers one of the finest dim sum experiences in the GTA. Below I will recount my experiences at G & O while providing you with a synopsis as to what dim dum is all about.    In a nutshell, dim sum refers to a collection of light dishes served typically in steamer baskets or small plates. It is typically served in the morning time until early afternoon and the dishes are cheaper then they are at dinner, similar concept to a \"happy hour\". Dim sum may also be referred to as \"yum cha\" which directly translates to \"drinking tea\", this term can be used instead of \"dim sum\" to describe the entire dining experience. Standard teas offered are fermented black tea, chrysanthemum, oolong or green tea.   All of the dishes that I have tried at G & O have always been fresh and delicious. I have listed 10 of my staples below but there are dozens and dozens and dozens of others, so a typical dim sum order is by no means limited to the items below.   \"chau siu baau\" -  a steamed BBQ pork bun. The texture of the white bun is uniquely fluffy and the BBQ pork filling is sweet and savoury. This item goes great with the house hot sauce.   \"siu mai\" - refers to a steamed dumpling. The version I am a custom to consists of pork, shrimp, mushroom and a series of other ingredients topped with roe. This item is delicious in flavour, unique in texture and is complimented well with house hot sauce, red rice vinegar, soy sauce or a combination of each.    \"cheong fun\" - is a steamed rice noodle roll. It is similar in shape to manicotti, however it is made from a wide sheet of rice noodle. My favourite renditions contain shrimp, pork or beef. These rolls are topped with soy sauce when served and have that standard rice noodle jelly-like texture. There is also a version of this roll which contains a donut like substance and is outstanding, it is served with a mixture of hoisin and peanut sauce and is to die for.    \"chicken feet\" - a major staple in dim sum, is literally chicken feet and can be referred to as phoenix talons. It is steamed or deep fried prior to being simmered in a sauce consisting of fermented beans and sugar. Eating these feet takes practice as there are a lot of bones to maneuver around but the ROI is worth it.    \"crispy fried octopus\" - the octopus tentacles are deep fried in a batter that tastes like that of a funnel cake?!? It is served with a sweet and sour sauce along with a mixture of salt and pepper, a dish similar to calamari.   \"spare ribs\" - pork spare ribs steamed along with fermented black beans. These ribs are served piping hot and sweet in flavour.   \"ginger scallion beef tripe\" - this particular tripe is derived from the stomach lining of a cow. It is lightly seasoned with ginger, scallions and garlic. Due to the unique texture and flavour it needs little seasoning and the whiter the tripe the better.   \"har gao\" - a steamed dumpling stuffed with shrimp either whole or chopped and may contain other ingredients such as bamboo, ginger, pepper and sesame oil. The wrap or outer layer of this dumpling is thin, translucent and chewy. In my experiences this item is one of the most popular dishes and pairs great with hot sauce, soy sauce or red rice vinegar.   \"turnip cake\" - a patty like cake made of shredded daikon, rice flour and water. Some versions contain dried shrimp, Chinese sausage and shitake mushrooms. The cake boasts great texture as the inside is very soft and chewy and the outside slightly crispy.    In addition to the items above there are dozens and dozens of other delectable dim sum items available at G & O. One of the major highlights for me at this restaurant is their peking duck. It is not available as a dim sum item but we order it off the dinner menu because it is so good. The skin is perfectly crisp and mostly separated from the meat. We eat the duck as is and also with the pancakes (similar to mini tortillas), scallions, carrots, cucumber and hoisin sauce.   The dim sum is made available to you by trolleys passing between tables, however if you arrive in the heart of lunchtime or have a big group at the table who knows what they need, I highly recommend requesting a menu and filling in an order sheet.   Overall I always have a great experience at this restaurant. The menu is well priced, staff are very courteous and the restaurant is clean and well kept. If you decide to partake in some sum on a Sunday morning, I suggest you show up well early or be prepared to wait in line.    4.2/5"}
{"text":"Came with some Chinese friends for dinner. I don't know what I ate as they ordered fin chinese. I thought it was good but nothing special. We had a fish dish that didn't taste very fresh to me. Spicy eggplant was good. Vegies also good. Beef dishes were good but found some of the food greasy."}
{"text":"Great variety and selection of dim sum, Ginger and Onion offers a very large seating area, which is especially nice on those busy weekends.  Arrived on a Saturday morning at 10:30am and seated immediately.  Deep fried sesame balls, egg tarts, rice noodle rolls (cheong fun), steamed shrimp dumplings (har gow), steamed dumplings and many more dishes were timed well for our table. My parents especially liked the chicken feet.  The large line-up began shortly after 11:00am and was out the door when we left so getting there early is a good idea.   Dim sum cost us $32 for four.   I think Ginger & Onion is one of those staples that people continuously go back to because it offers standard, delicious dishes.  I've heard the dinners are good as well."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I are a FAN!  When we think dim sum, this is it. Why? Tasty food and price.  Portions are big and reasonable to share. We've ordered 5 dishes and it came to $14 something. It's usually crowded on weekends but we like to come during weekdays just before lunch starts cause you may wait up to 20 to 30 minutes. No kidding!  I've been coming to this place forever! My parents originally introduced me to this place. It hasn't changed much, other than decor. I've brought my friends and they love this place!  No matter who you come with, you'll find something to eat. Unless, you have one that's exceptional picky. You know who you are."}
{"text":"We have been going to Gingers & Onions for many years and it is very consistent and the food is full of favour. The service is ok and the wait is long on Sunday but it's worth it for the food and price. I highly recommend this place for dim sum."}
{"text":"So because my family and I are Asian, the hostess automatically assumes we understand what she's saying... There was confusion when she called our table and she starts yelling at my mom in front of the whole restaurant. Needless to say she got an earful from me.   The nerve...i saw no issues with her speaking to other guests when they spoke her language. I've been here with Caucasian friends and they bow down to them, it's disgusting. Yet if I'm Asian and I speak English you treat us like garbage.   Try the dimsum restaurant inside market village, food is about the same but don't have to deal with this scunt."}
{"text":"Ginger & Onion keeps me coming back! (not anymore, read further...) - 4.5/5  This is my family's go-to restaurant for classic dim sum or what Cantonese people call \"yum cha\" which literally translates to \"drink tea\" in Cantonese. We have been coming here for years and it rarely fails to disappoint! The place is clean, doesn't have an overtly strong smell of food and that's rare because the majority of the resturants I've been to, I leave the place with a lingering smell in my clothes and in my hair. To order, the dim sum carts of food circle the restaurant floor, you can either wait for them to come by your seating area, give your order sheet to them and they will mark down it accordingly or walk up to their cart with your order sheet and pick up a dish. Most recently, my boyfriend and I came to dine here about 2 weeks ago while this deliciousness was still operating.  Presentation: Clean plates, food placed nicely, spacious seating, all staff in uniform  Pros: Taste is consistent, portions are generous and wait staff speak Chinglish (it's endearing ^.^)  Cons: Sometimes a dish takes forever to come out and the wait times for seating range from 20 minutes to 1 hour but so worth it so it's a bittersweet Con, NOT all day dim-sum, NO ENGLISH on order sheet so you MUST know the names of the dish to order ^.^'  Fave Eats: Tripe, (boyfriend says it's \"too chew\"), never fails to disappoint in flavour; Siu Mai, four big fresh juicY pieces; Jah Haa Gok, I love the \"mayo\" they serve on the side (miracle whip in disguise) and I dip everything into that and Yau Yee Sou, apparently every restaurant makes it different, they do it with the batter and that's the best way to enjoy it (even though it would cause yeet-hay later, haha)!  Price: dirt cheap, a dish costs less than $3!  Seconds: YES PLEASE! but PERMANENTLY CLOSED NOW, womp womp ='("}
{"text":"Went this morning with my husband and sister in-law for dim sum for the first time.  I was a little weary as I had read quite a few negative comments about the food and the service but was pleasantly surprised with the food....but not the service, hence the three stars.  We had:  Crispy Octopus - A little rubbery but very tasty Crab Claw - not bad but couldn't get over the texture Radish Cake - Delicious!!! Baked and Steamed BBQ Bun - Delicious and lots of filling!! Crispy Taro stuffed with pork - very crispy and tasty Pork Congee - Bland - not good at all Fried Shrimp Dumpling - Ohhhh soooo gooood Shrimp Wontons - Fantastic! Rice Pastry Stuffed with Pork - A must try! Egg Tarts - Double up on these...trust me!!!! Mango Pudding - So silky and soooo delicious - get it with evaporated milk.  I would go again just because the food was really good but I was disappointed in the service.  Most of the ladies pushing the carts with the food tried to ignore us but I made sure to stop them so that I could take a look at what they were offering. They looked bothered whenever I would stop them...so sorry ladies that I do not understand the language you are speaking but funny how you can explain in English what it is you have on your cart after you are forced to stop. Not professional at all.  I would have given this experience a four star had the service been good.  Although, I must say that there was one lady in particular that made the dining experience better for us. She was older, tall, and had wavy hair past her ears; she was nice, tried to explain what she had on her cart without being asked and was also quite funny!!  The others have a lot to learn from this lady!!  With all that said, I would come back for the food for sure!!"}
{"text":"I actually really liked the desserts!  I haven't had 'tofu flower' in a very, very long time.  While the tofu in this dessert wasn't the most smooth that I've had, it was still decent.  I also enjoyed the black sesame soup too.  Yum!  Two great desserts that we had to finish off our dim sum session."}
{"text":"RSVP to avoid long wait time. I have tried a vast number of Dim Sum restaurants. Ginger & Onion Cuisine is definitely by far one of my fav. There are varieties of selections and many different new items/dishes."}
{"text":"This place has been our favorite Dim Sum spot, each time we come home for vacation. We have since found a new place but this is still solid good Dim Sum we have enjoyed for 5 years. Affordable and good for groups of people."}
{"text":"Needed a Hadron Collider to break apart the Snot particle on my Tea cup."}
{"text":"When I was visting T-Dot we had a big old family dinner at this restaurant. Free range chicken at a chinese restaurant, this is a first for me and it was really enjoyable. A memorable dish was the King Do Spare Ribs, they used a type of dry rub and added a type of winter squash which was an amazing combination. You also get a choice of what kind of sweet soup you get when you are done which was a delightful ending to an enjoyable dinner. The place is extremely busy on a Tuesday night and I can just imagine how hectic the weekends would be."}
{"text":"It was a long wait wait for a table here but I'm guessing most dim sum places are like this. At least the good ones.  The lady at the front would only call out the numbers in chinese.  So if you don't know your chinese, I would make sure that she knows this.  We got our table after 15-20 minutes of waiting. They seated us in the very back room.  Which I didn't realize was terrible. The carts won't go all the way in.  And the people with the carts would just say what they have at the door.  Also another issue if you don't know chinese.    It was also harder to get a waitress's attention as they do not come into this room that often.    The food was ok 3/5.  The Har Gow (Shrimp dumplings) had lots of small shrimps in it but I noticed that the veins were left on.  Plus some bites did have the shells bits.  Which was a bit disappointing.  The rice noodle roll was very plump but a bit cold.  The soup dumplings was ok and was hot.  The squid with salt was a bit over cooked and chewy.    I have been here before as it's very conveniently closed beside Pacific mall.  But this experience this time was not great."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times for both dim sum and dinner. Dim sum is good. Dinner is equally good. They are known for their peking duck apparently since all the tables around us ordered it.... We didn't know so we didn't order it but we will next time! Quality of food is fresh and service is quick."}
{"text":"This place is super busy like almost always for Dim Sum.  Weekends are a write off, especially since you'll have to make your way through the bumper cars of a plaza, called Pacific Mall.  This place I think thrives on Dim Sum alone, and I've been here hundreds of times (weekly at one point in my sad existence), so I know the food is pretty good and cheap.  A side note I should mention, this place is somehow related to (maybe same owners) to Honey & Garlic which is just up the street.  Also super busy, but their interior is much nicer (the location used to be a Swiss Chalet and I don't think they changed the seating arrangement at all).    Ginger & Onion cuisine is a fav for my parents. my mom and dad come here for their b-day/mom/father's day celebration.  Their peeking duck is pretty popular, you get the dough wrappers with the duck skin and then lettuce wrappers with the duck meat and stir fried with other stuff. It's a lot of food, but for a hefty $30, it better be.    You get a big pot of soup with every meal as well as a choice of three desserts.  It's a pretty good place for larger groups, if you like that type of Chinese food. it's in a weird category, not really fast-food Chinese food, but also not really a fancy place..."}
{"text":"They have terrible service and that's all you should know. Unless you're some old senior that frequents it daily or nightly, you ain't about to get shit around here. Especially if you're not fluent in Chinese, and you seem like you're stuck between the phase of adulthood and childhood- aka me, you're gonna get treated badly here. Many times they just ignore you and there's no hostess at the front. When the hostess is there, she doesn't really do much of anything. When it's busy, it's packed- no organization of people + no room to stand between the door and the hostess stand = one big mess.   Food wise, they're mediocre. It's not terrible but not amazing. Everything is a little bit salty and a lot packed with the special Asian drug (msg).. Gotta admit, I enjoy Peking duck anywhere though. The sweet and sour pork is pretty good sometimes but the quality isn't always consistent.. sometimes it's a bit soggy? You know that soggy sweet and sour meat taste? Not good, right? There really is not much I can say about the food.   I haven't been here for a few years and don't think I'd be returning unless I am dragged here for a family dinner or something?"}
{"text":"This place is still good but they have increased their dimsum prices. The weekday morning special is now $2.95 and weekend morning special is $3.20. No tea price charge in the morning. If I pay around this price there are plenty of other options that have a better atmosphere, decoration, service, and cleaniness."}
{"text":"Great tasting food for the Chinese New Year. Efficient service. Great Peking Duck,  meaty lobsters. Perfectly cooked and good tasting greens."}
{"text":"i give this a 2.5 rating at most. it's an okay place for some dim sum.  for the most part, i like this place because it has steamed turnip/radish cake which is MY ABSOLUTE FAV other than that, their other stuff is just meh...a lot of their food ain't that fresh  i feel like this place is quite unsanitary and dear god there have been multiple times where i have found a piece of who knows what hair in my food LIKE ITS ALWAYS ME WHAT IS WITH ME AND THIS ILL-FATED RELATIONSHIP WITH HAIR IN MY FOOD LIKE WHAT DID I DO TO DESERVE THIS anyways yeah and also...i have seen little tiny bugs on the table before like ?!?!!!!! am i yum chaing with my fam and bugs now ?!?  ***as much as i like ordering food off the paper menus..i do like how this place utilizes carts!! it feels more like a yum cha place ya know?:P"}
{"text":"Our party of 3 came on a Saturday morning around 9am and it was about 1/3 full when we walked in. By the time we left around 10am, it was starting to fill up, but no line ups yet.  The dimsum is $3.2 each, rice is $3.8 and the tea charge is $1.2 per person. We were seriously disappointed by the quality of their food and experience though - very fatty meat, small dishes, little variety in dimsum, lukewarm tea and poor service. Although they have \"carts\", the variety in their dimsum is limited and tends to be very, very traditional - nothing novel or cool. Their service is poor - very unattentive, bordering on rude and it's next to impossible to go here if you aren't fluent in Chinese."}
{"text":"Hurray, lunchtime push cart dim sum! (I don't understand why push carts are becoming rare these days--I grew up eating and thinking push cart service is how dim sum must is done.) But boo, the variety and quality of food they push around.  It's so-so overall. Sure it is decently cheap, the service is generally acceptably standard, and they serve many of the classic dim sum food. I however found many of the food here underwhelming. Their har gow, siu mai and pig's blood pudding were not as juicy, hot and savoury as I would like. The cleanliness could be much improved.  Generally speaking, the eateries within the Pacific Mall/Market Village site leaves much to be desired. The only major thing going for Ginger & Onion are the three lion dance lions hanging from the ceiling, all pointing at the entrance (which is separate from the rest of the Market Village complex), greeting each diner walking in.  By the way, what the heck English restaurant name is \"Ginger & Onion\"? If it is meant to be a reference to the dip often served with dim sum, it's a marketing idea only a Hobbit could come up with for a restaurant name."}
{"text":"Had high expectations for this place from all the reviews but was dissapointed with the food. The service was great (the dim sum cart ladies were very nice and attentive even when we were in an inaccessible location of the restaurant) but unfortunatley the food failed to impress. The dim sum tastes like the McDonalds version of dim sum but at mid-range prices."}
{"text":"You know that moment when you're at a restaurant and you look over the next table; see them receive food that looks amazing; and wish that you can order the same but you're unsure of what it is, or what it's called?   Ginger & Onion and other traditional (push cart) dim sum places is the answer for these moments as you can LITERALLY ask for a plate of the same thing for your table.  Push cart dim sum, just in case you've never been, is where several servers push around carts with mini plates of sampler sized cooked food; passing by each table to offer a plate to the patrons.  Imagine tapa style dishes with preview option on wheels!  Almost 85% of the dishes have pork and/or shrimp so if you're a fan; this is a definite must!!  This place is our go-to every Sunday lunch after basketball.    Our order normally includes, but are not limited to: deep fried calamari tentacles (crunchy but the inside is flavorful and juicy) Har gow (shrimp wrapped in rice wrap) Shiu Mai (minced pork & shrimp) Steamed pork & mushroom on rice pot (my fave!)  Garlic Choy sum (Chinese broccoli) Minced shrimp stuffed tofu, green peppers, & eggplant  Skin rolls (sounds gross; but it's just ground pork with thin strips of shitake mushroom and bamboo shoots inside a tofu bean curd sheet) Deep fried shrimp dumpling Steamed BBQ pork buns BBQ pork sticky fried rice  Cheung fan - BBQ pork or Shrimp (thought I was kidding about the 85%?) wrapped in rice wrap with sweet soy sauce   For dessert: Tofu Fah - sweet tofu with a simple sugar syrup (my FAVE dessert) Black sesame soup (sweet and smooth tasting though it looks gritty and well... Black) Mango jelly with evaporated milk (sometimes shaped as a fish; heart; etc... Sweet and is definitely a kid favourite) Sesame ball with red bean (sweet red bean inside a thin rice ball layer covered in sesame) Ma Lai Go -Chinese version of a steamed sponge cake  At $3-$4.50 per order, our order for 7 usually ends up around 15 per person which includes tax, tip, and a full stomach. Not the cheapest dim sum we've been to but for the price and quality, so far, one of our top three dim sum joints for sure - I score this place 3.5 - 4 stars!"}
{"text":"The food is not bad but not the cheapest.    Today the service was bad.  One of the server told me not to speak Cantonese if I couldn't say it properly; she said she'll just say it in Mandarin.  But the funny thing was I couldn't understand her Mandarin either!.  I will not pay again for this kind of service!"}
{"text":"My family used to always come here DimSum until they increased their prices and the food quality went downhill. We came back for a Dim Sum lunch as we were nearby, and things haven't really changed.   They use the push-carts for Dim Sum instead of ordering on a sheet at most Dim Sum places, so you do wait awhile and some of the food you want to order on the cart is gone by the time it gets to your table. The food quality was not great at all, as some of the items did not taste fresh. They also wheeled out a bunch of Fried Items most of the time, and within 2 hours they finally brought out the staples such as Sui Mai and Har Gow when we were about to leave.  Service is not great either, as the staff are kind of rude, and while you're eating this guy pushed my arm just to collect an empty plate from our table. The prices aren't cheap either."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner after shopping during my visit to Toronto.  It's a decent dinner place.  The beef with ginger & scallion was a bit on the oily side, but it's tasty.  Dinner special (discounted price dishes) available when you spend $10 or above (which is easy).  We got the discount dish of lobster.  Lobster was small, but taste good.  I think it's a good deal.  Service was very good, all the waiters and waitresses are being very helpful.  I was eyeing on one of the dish that came out of the kitchen, not really knowing what it is coz it's half covered.  She waitress that was serving the table next to us actually saw me wondering and told me what it is.  lol..."}
{"text":"The restaurant's clock is a little faster than normal time. Becareful if you're there for their early dim sum pricing. The manager will not be lenient about this matter"}
{"text":"In more than 30 years of eating dimsum in Toronto, I can say, in all honesty, that I have never had better dimsum than my family and I had this morning, at Ginger and Onion. There was a steady stream of carts with a great variety of fresh, tasty offerings. The serving staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The few times the server did not speak English, they quickly found someone who could translate for them. The price was excellent, $45 total for 15 dishes which filled the 6 of us. We left full and content and eager to return. Thank you Ginger and Onion for a wonderful dining experience!"}
{"text":"A favourite place of ours. The long lineups every weekend are a testament to the quality of the food here. There's something comforting about this place, with the carts and loud Cantonese ladies (they're not angry or anything, they just talk that way!). Sure, the decor is dated, but that's just part of the old-school appeal! Best thing to get is the special items they have occasionally, the scallops or oysters, done up with garlic or black beans, and the little seen small geoducks, done the same way. Really great."}
{"text":"The food is on par with other dimsum places but the service terrible. I have never been so angry at a place for blatantly being so goddamn rude, I had decent experiences in the past but this time I will reconsider ever returning again. I asked for 2 extra chairs for our table, and the brought 1. Had to go and ask a different person again it only took a good 15 minutes to get our seats after we already received our food. During our meal we asked for 3 ice waters and a fork for the child at our table. The server proceeded to leave mid conversation. She brought back 3 ice waters so we asked again for the fork. She replied rudely \"OK! OK! OK!\" That was the moment I knew that I was not coming back. Even after that, another women driving the food cart had food that we wanted and she told us to wait because the wanted to go to the back of the room first. Then she came back and walked right past us. Great service!!! I had to walk to the cart myself and get my own food. It's that day and age where the food industry is getting really competitive and another business with better customer service will run this place down. Absolutely disappointed in the place. JimStar Out"}
{"text":"I love this place  So good  I always leave super full cause I literally overeat cause I'm enjoying it so much  The food is fantastic!  I suggest to google the food you want to get before you go so you know how to ask for it since not many of the girls who push the carts are fluent in English but they know when you use your fingers to show how many you want  Amazing!"}
{"text":"This is our go-to for dim sum and it's good but not the greatest of service. They come around with carts and if you don't flag them down, they won't come to you! We went on a weekday and the selection was also not the greatest - there was hardly any carts coming around and the ones that did didn't have the variety of dim sum that we were looking for. Sure, you can always order off the menu but where's the fun in that?!"}
{"text":"This place is always busy during dim sum hours.  One of the few places that still does the carts pushed by yelling ladies between crowded tables -- the way the dim sum experience should be. The quality of the food has been reliable and good.  Since there is a crowd, you have to keep your eyes peeled for your favorites before it disappears.  The good thing is that the dishes are always fresh and piping hot. The bad thing is that you might miss out. But that is part of the fun."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming here for years. They are consistently good. Love that they still have pushy carts during dimsum. Atmosphere is pretty outdated and service is mediocre but food is pretty good. The noodle and rice dishes during lunch are also a great deal."}
{"text":"This was our favourite place to go for dim sum, the place is close now, they are moving to a new location which they will let us all know. Sad day.."}
{"text":"Came here for dimsum on a Thursday morning, the carts were slow to come around and the more classic dishes came towards the end.  Took a long wait for it, while less common foods were circulating for a LONG time.   Food quality here is mediocre in comparison, one problem about carts is that the food items do not remain as fresh.  One of my fried foods were actually soggy, which took the flavour out completely.  Also, the waitress was incredibly rude.  I was still adding more money onto my bill and she just snatches it away, despite me calling after her.  Not only was the waitress rude, but one of the cart pushing ladies was slightly aggressive.  She didn't see us looking at her and was getting our attention by yelling just so that we look at her cart.  Really? For two people, it cost us $35, I can get better dimsum for that money.  Will not be returning"}
{"text":"Went here based on a friend's recommendation because I was looking for baked custard tapioca pudding. A little pricy for dim sum but it tasted great.  Went on a Saturday around 11ish and the place was very busy. Had to wait 30 minutes to be seated. Service wasn't bad, food came out a bit slow but that's expected when ladies are pushing food trolleys. Didn't get the chance to eat my baked custard tapioca pudding but instead has the red bean tapioca pudding. Didn't like it at all. Loved the mango pudding that was served with a bit of evaporated milk. So yummy. Love har gaw and sui Mai, and dumplings were great too. Pricer than Perfect restaurant in Scarborough."}
{"text":"Came here for dim sum breakfast one morning and dinner one evening. Prices are reasonable for their tasty dim sum and entrees. The dim sum and dinner entrees are really good!   Served via a moving cart, the dim sum are freshly made and steaming hot, which included steamed items, rice with meat/veggies, congee, fried or baked items, cheong fun (rice rolls), and desserts.  Although we looked forward to trying their wide assortment of dim sum, we had a limited choice of items because of where we were seated. We noticed that the dim sum carts followed a regular path around the main dining area which leads into a separate dining area and out again to the main area. As we were seated at the end of the carts' routing, we easily saw the popular items being selected as fast as you can blink by other diners before the carts came to us. As such, it was kind of disappointing to find that they didn't have much of a variety on the carts by the time they came to us; however, what we were able to get were delicious.  Just before we left, we asked for a take-out menu, which we were given. So here's my plan for the next time:  we'll ask for a table at the beginning of the carts' routing and bring the take-out menu so that we can \"pre-order\" certain items if they are not on the carts (the only drawback, though, is that we won't know how they look like).  We decided to have dinner here to try their specialty, the Peking Duck.  We loved it, and will be back for more, considering how good it was and pricewise, how reasonable it was. The server brings the whole duck to show you, and with your approval, will carve it in front of you.  The duck's crispy skin, with a little piece of meat, green onion, and hoi sin sauce, is eaten with a thin \"pancake wrapper,\" similar to a thin tortilla. The second course includes the rest of the duck meat removed from the bones and stir-fried with veggies and sauce and eaten wrapped in fresh lettuce leaves. We also ordered their house noodles.  The meal came with complimentary soup and dessert (sweet soft tofu or black bean sesame). Everything was very good, and the portions were generous.  We noticed that there were specials written on a board on the wall above the fish tanks; however, we could not read it because everything was written in Chinese. Despite giving excellent service, our server could speak very little English, so we were directed to the manager a number of times, as he could understand and speak English and was able to answer our questions about our orders.  I guess that's the drawback of going to these good and authentic restaurants - you're not gonna get a first-rate experience unless you can speak Chinese or are with friends who can. As with the breakfast, we got a take-out dinner menu, and when we go back, I'll study the menu and get an idea what we want instead of going in blind. Will still need the help of the manager to tell us what the specials are on the board, though.  Despite the language barrier, we loved the food!"}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate a family members birthday and it was your typical Cantonese style restaurant. I'd come here again for another celebration or even for dinner with family."}
{"text":"Came here with my parents and godparents for lunch. The restaurant was a lot cleaner than almost every Chinese restaurant in NY. We had the traditional Cantonese entrees and it was probably the best I've ever had. Everything tasted fresh despite how busy the place must have been. The peking duck sandwiches are delicious and they come around with a huge duck to slice the pieces for you. Service was good and staff was very attentive. Would definitely come back again when I visit my godparents."}
{"text":"This year when we got to G & O Cuisine, we did not have to wait in line! Service was great, so was the meal! Everyone was famished by the car ride and it seems like we tried a bit of everything. A whole chicken and a lot of dim sum. Really love the mango pudding. The best meal I have ever had here and the best octopus tentacles in town."}
{"text":"Pros: Dim sum prices pretty good no matter which day/time Carts are efficient   Cons: Dim sum is just average at best  Came here on a Sunday morning for a family gathering.  We were a group of 18 so we were split into 2 tables.  This place is very busy for on the weekends for dim sum.  There is a \"early bird\" type special for all times during the week.  Small, Medium and Large dim sum plates are all under at $3 no matter the time of the week. There aren't many places that have this kind of pricing so that's a boon right there.  This is also one of the few places that still uses dim sum carts.  Most places now have you order everything at once, and then servers will bring the dishes to you.  It is a much more efficient way honestly.  Personally though, I like the carts.  It's a nostalgic sort of feeling for me.  With carts, if you're a seasoned dim sum customer, you know sometimes you have to be aggressive to get the dishes you want.  You don;t have to be here.  The carts here are very efficient.  They come by enough times and they have enough dishes on the carts where they won't run out before making their way through the whole restaurant.  The dim sum itself here though, is pretty meh.  There was nothing that really made it stand out from the rest.  I had a siu mai where the shrimp inside still had the skin on it which was not nice at all.  It's the trade off for the price I guess.  It's not horrible, but it's nowhere near the better ones either.  The service here, for how busy this place can get is pretty good.  They're running around everywhere making sure all the customers needs are met.  Being a group of 18 means a lot of request and they were all met quickly.  If you don't like waking up early to get to dim sum places before 11 to take advantage of early bird specials, this place is a good option for you.  The dim sim isn't the best, but you can;t argue with the price."}
{"text":"Another place that I go to regularly with my family.  If you visit on the weekends, make sure you arrive early, probably before 6 pm, if you don't want to be waiting for a table. It gets pretty packed here!  For vegetarian options, there is soft tofu with bok choy, as well as spicy fried tofu with cashews.  Like typical Chinese restaurants, rice is ordered separately by the bowl.  And like typical Chinese restaurants, they put in MSG to pump up the flavours.  Desserts are included, often with a choice between soft tofu with ginger, red bean soup or black sesame dessert (I don't know how to translate the names properly!!).  A little secret: green tea ice-cream is not offered, but if you ask, the waitresses will grudgingly bring it out."}
{"text":"Not a bad spot. Have been here numerous times for dim sum and dinner. I've been told that this place is the bomb dot com for dim sum, but honestly it seems like it's gone downhill since then? I don't think I'd go out of my way to come here for food. I've had better and I don't need to wait in line."}
{"text":"didnt find it worth my money. Service was bad. Maybe i was there too early on a Sunday ."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner.  The last time i was here was over a year ago. I remember the food was ok back then. Now ... its just .. below average. Kind of bland.  Lobster was just all sauce to give it some taste. The bok choy with mushrooms... covered with sauce!, under the sauce.. was bland. The fried rice was bland.  It felt like it was all filler food.  I did eat until i was full.. but not satisfying.  Surprisingly its busy.   Would i come back here... not likely if the food quality stays like this.  Hope it changes soon, cause i do like the parking - lots because its a corner restaurant."}
{"text":"I am according Ginger & Onion four stars because I like to encourage them and their push cart style of dim sum delivery. There are not many places left, which have carts anymore and more and more of them are closing and changing to the less labour intensive waiter-and-menu method. It is too bad. I have been enjoying push carts for years and they are dwindling. Even Ginger & Onion had a sister counterpart up the road years ago.  I have been here before and the service was the best I have ever seen from them today. The carts kept coming quickly, there was a variety of dim sum being offered, waitress refilled the water and brought tea (which is not free) quickly. The carts came at a regular pace so no matter which side of the room you were or which dumplings or desserts, etc. you wanted you would be satisfied. This is not always the case here in the past. The siu mai was disappointing and flaccid, but everything else worked Oddly, my favourite items was the fried tofu. They also were carting shrimp dumplings, rice rolls, crispy shrimp, ribs sesame balls and many dessert items. Being at Pacific Mall there is not a lot of parking and there is a rush at the door so they hand out numbers. My tip is to arrive before 11:30 or after 1:00 for lunch. Speaking of which dumplings are priced per item and are most expensive (like $3.20 each) during meal hours, cheaper ($2.90) during the afternoon and cheapest (I believe $2.60 each) morning. Yes, they are open all day. Great!"}
{"text":"AMAZING Chinese food. My friend and I have to go every couple of months. We are usually seated right away. Despite the staff not really being able to speak English or us Chinese, we can communicate just fine and they are always accommodating. The green bean dish is a favourite. Good amount of food for the price as well. We've always left with leftovers."}
{"text":"AVOID! Went for dim sum and the front desk manager/ waiter barely understood English.   Sat down after selecting dim sum and she tried to charge me for takeout before dim sum time expired!  The octopus tentacles were VERY RUBBERY! LIKE THEY FRIED PLASTIC!   Then she started jumping to the music beside my table! Unprofessional and illiterate woman.   GO TO CASA IMPERIAL OR SPRING VILLA INSTEAD."}
{"text":"Yummy dim sum! Food is insanely cheap! They have people that take carts of different food and you pick what you want. All their dim sum is delicious! My husband loves all their lotus stuff. Their pastries are also really good. We sat at a good table. We were right by the kitchen so they always stopped by our table first. Yasss."}
{"text":"\"We done did some dim sum and I liked it! Ya, I liked it!\" This dim sum place was great.  We were a small group seated in the tea room; private room away from the Sunday afternoon chaos.  Honestly, I've been to plenty of dim sum places but this one takes the cake.  The fried shrimp dumplings were succulent and just a tad sweet.  Har gow and siu mai were beautiful packages of yum.  Surprisingly the har gow had no row garnish which was fine by me.  I'll be back soon with my sweat pants so I can eat more. Nom nom."}
{"text":"Been here twice on my random trips to Canada. Located near Pacific mall.   Pretty tasty dim sum. Place is usually quite busy. Service is all right. Reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Last two visits were disappointing.    1.  Yam cha wrappers were very thick, and not well sealed.  Looked as though they were prepared in a hurry; 2.  The har gau literally fell apart - not even sealed! 3.  Even though there wasn't a line up last time (very unusual), they still hustled us in and out of there, cleaning the table the minute we finished and put our tea cups down; 4.  I asked for choi sum which they said they didn't have - I mean, seriously, what is dim sum without a green vegetable?  They kept offering some cold green vegetable which had been pushed around in the cart for over an hour instead of hot choi sum with oyster sauce - the way it should be done.  The curry cuttlefish is always good here."}
{"text":"My family comes here on a weekly basis and we enjoy coming here despite some of the slip ups in the quality of food/service.  I find that the line ups for dimsum are really unbearable from 12 pm. Sometimes I end up waiting for more than half an hour. And the lady at the front never seems to smile... she kinda looks like she hates her job to be honest lol. I find the ladies that move the trolleys are much more nicer, and are willing to talk/joke around with customers.  The shrimp dumplings, (Ha-gow), are sometimes really good and other times not so much. A couple of times, the dumpling skin was poorly made, and broken from being drenched in condensation. As well, I was unlucky to find sand after biting into the shrimp... This happened more than once. I'm guessing it wasn't cleaned very well. Also, I've noticed that if you take home the Ha-gow, it smells of ammonia... which is really off-putting.  And...most of the deep fried food isn't hot... The only items really hot are the ones covered in the steam baskets. This really disappointed me.   I wouldn't say the dimsum here is especially cheap either. However they have special dimsum price from 1:30pm onwards on weekdays. I believe special price is $2.10/item, while it is regularly priced at $2.30/item. You will know if you have the special price based on the red pen markings on your dimsum paper. Also, they charge a tea fee (i believe it's 1$ per person, it came to 5$ for 5 people at my table). Usually our dimsum comes to about $50-60 for 5 people (18 dishes). Also, the dishes aren't really big portions either."}
{"text":"Ate at this restaurant for Chinese New Years. Felt like it was nothing special. Nothing really Wowed me. Just a regular Chinese restaurant.   All the food was pretty much ok but the lobster wasn't good. No one really ate it cause the flavour was a little off. They used too much garlic which threw off the whole lobster.   Their scallops were pretty good but a little salty because it was black bean flavoured. They were priced at around $7-8 each.   Loved the dessert they had though. They gave you a choice of black sesame or red bean. Most places offer red bean desserts. But not a lot of places have black sesame. It was pretty good.   Other than that, nothing really stood out."}
{"text":"Not a good place the quality is what u pay for. Hargow still had shrimp w the vein still in. Was ok but nothing special. Worst part is when I went to pay the owner took my order slip and then passed me the interac to pay. Found the amount to be funny so asked him to see my bill. He charged me $4 more (not about the amount but the principle)!!!! I was soooo mad and he quickly paid me back the money he tried to scam me out of. Will never go back and for all of u do not go there as they will try to cheat u out of ur hard earned money. Must admit this is the second time this Happened to me at a Chinese restaurant. Maybe it's because I don't speak Chinese"}
{"text":"A bit off the beaten path as it's not in downtown Toronto Chinatown. As a visitor, we weren't 100% sure what we were getting ourselves into, but am glad that we found this place. We got there around 1p and only waited about 15 mins for a table. This place is quite big with a few random rooms in the corners. (I'm sure these rooms are used as private/banquet rooms during non-dim sum time.) Unfortunately we were seated way in the back of one of these rooms and I think we felt quite neglected. A lot of carts just didn't make it back them - my hunch is that they ran out of the dish while they were going around in the main area. My suggestion is if you see them seating you in of of these areas, asked for a different table in the main room.   Even though we got there a bit late for \"normal dim-sum time,\" there was still quite a few options and everything tasted very fresh and didn't taste like it has been sitting around for hours. I can honestly say that I think I had the best shao mai I've ever had. You could taste all the different ingredients in it and it was all very fresh. The rice noodle rolls were quite good as well and we got both the shrimp and beef. On of my favorites is the egg tart. If I don't get this dish during dim sum, then I don't feel like I've had a complete meal. Their was still warm off the cart, not too sweet and was just a bit of heaven.   I would definitely go back the next time I visit Toronto and get my dim sum fix!"}
{"text":"great dim sum! it's fresh and tasty. packed with a line on a thursday afternoon. One tip: if you notice some of tea pots have hot water, others have tea, so you can choose how concentrated the tea is. I was drinking hot water and complaining how weak the tea was. Until we found out, for some reason they decided to put all the hot water on one side of a big table.... doesn't make sense to me."}
{"text":"I  was disappointed at the service and lack of  enough dim sum.   My mother and I came in before noon on Friday.  We given a number and waited about 5 minutes.  We sat down and the server asked what kind of tea and 2 glasses of wAter and everything was downhill. The dim sum carts where slow to come.  We asked a total of 6 times for the standard Har Gow and shuimai  Finally a cart shows up after an hour waiting and the last goes to the table before  us. We asked when more is coming and they said long time.  You would have thought that these are the most common dim sums they would have more then 6 of them. My mother had to go after the cart after we told them we wanted the steamed barbecue pork buns. They there was only 2 plates of egg tarts. I asked for one and she gives it away to another table.   We asked for a bowl of soup that took 45 minutes.  We asked for a box for leftover and check.  The check took a while to get and no takeout box came. I searched for box and found it at cashiers desk and  packed up my leftover   The waitress runs over to our table as soon as she sees it is cash  she says. The check did not include the tip and stood there until she got her tip.  We gave only 10 percent and she gave us a disgusted look and walked away.  I find it bold to ask for tip and wouldn't leave until she got her tip. We had to do a lot of what the service staff was suppose to do.  And then the last of dim sum and the slow carts.    Needless to say we will not be back as we love dim  sum and have never had this happen to us with bad service  and running out of dim sum"}
{"text":"If you miss the old style of push cart dim sum that wheels past your table, this is the place.  It might not be the highest quality in Markham, but being able to see what you are ordering is a great part of the experience when you don't speak Chinese.  Best dish was the Gai-bao, the chicken in rice flour buns... the Cha-sui bao was good too but I had never had the chicken version be so tasty, a lovely hit of ginger in every bite.  The shui-mai and har-gow were a bit disappointing, but I think I have super high standards on those.  Another steller dish was the chopped up pork spareribs with black bean... each of us could have had 4 dishes... yes, you have to eat the meat off the shards of bone, but its so damned tasty!    Oh, and the crispy fried squid - tender and tasty!  In fact I would say all the deep fried items were surprisingly non oily.  I concede the MSG levels here are probably high, but just drink a lot of tea and have some of the lovely warm sago egg custard pudding bowl for dessert... so yummy!    If you don't speak Chinese, prepare to do a lot of pointing and deciding if the mystery is worth the risk!  And from my experience the giant metal heat trays have congee or other bland stuffs that are not what I want from dim sum.  While waiting in line, remember, long line ups = good food."}
{"text":"I used to really dislike this place because I didn't think there was anything special about it compared to the other dim sum restaurants in Markham. But over the years, I'm starting to think this is one of the only dim sum restaurants left (in Markham atleast??) that serves up some classic dim sum dishes that you can't find in other dim sum restaurants. Examples? Chinese Cotton Chicken, Pig Blood Curd, Fried Fish with \"Lots of Roe\", Steamed Sponge Cake (can you easily find plain ones anymore?), Fried Sesame Balls etc etc. (The names don't sound so appetizing but they are so good and so classic!).   I want to stress about their Steamed Egg Pudding (Dun Daan) and their Steamed Egg White Milk Pudding (Dun Lai). It tastes better than other Chinese Dessert places. It's super smooth, it's packed with egg-y/milky flavour (whereas other places the Egg Pudding just tastes like milk), and it's so cheap! This dessert alone makes me want to come here all the time.   This place is good, and although it's not particularly my favourite dim sum restaurant, it's a nice escape from the other ones when you want some simple and classic dishes. Service is also getting better and they still use push-carts rather than paper menus!"}
{"text":"Great place for dimsum on the weekends. If you get there before 9am, you will get a seat. Anytime after that, expect to wait at least 30 mins for a table. Not so bad for tables of 2-4, but anything more than that, you have to wait for a family to complete eating before you can sit and order.  Food is pretty tasty, and price is affordable."}
{"text":"Went here for dim sum today. It was for my grandma's birthday. Coincidentally we were seated beneath the symbol for birthday so it was going to be a good day. Anyway, we were seated and the food games began. We got almost two of everything that wasn't dessert and when we did get dessert, we got two.   All the usual suspects were there. Siu Mai, chicken feet, beef tendon, some kind of fish, rice noodle, duck feet, pig feet, noodles, chnese broccoli, and sticky rice. For dessert we had the sweet tofu.   My biggest complaint is that the food came out slower and slower as our meal went on. It was almost like they wanted your brain to catch up with your stomach. There were times when our table had no food on it.   All in all it was a good time. If you can believe it, we had 8 people and the meal was less than $80!   Lots of parking but be warned that I've heard this place can have quite the line."}
{"text":"1 Star for the food and 1 Star just because of nostalgic push cart dim sum  Food is really going downhill since I last visited. Everything is sticky and dirty from the spoons, teacups and chopsticks.  My Yelp friend kept trying to wipe the chopsticks with hot tea and napkins and it was not helping much...  A few old style dim sum items we ordered just for old time sake....  Probably won't be back..."}
{"text":"Ginger and onion is your go-to Chinese restaurant for the Markham (Pmall area) locals.  Expect to have to wait for seating if you come here on a weekend for Dim Sum after 10am. Parking will also be a free for all but it's just a testament to how popular this place is, not to mention that it'll attract everyone who's been shopping at either Market Village or Pacific Mall, and looking for a bit to eat.  Dinner is a different story but it's still very busy on the weekends. The food is fresh just from the sheer amount of turnover this restaurant gets, and the fact that they're located steps from the local grocer, so they don't need to keep inventory on hand too long. True story: I actually saw staff at the grocery store purchasing meat and vegetables. Talk about Just-in-time delivery!  Overall this is a good option for Chinese food, whether Dim Sum or Dinner and you'll look like you know your stuff cause this is the local hot spot!"}
{"text":"I think this place deserves a much better rating than it has based on my most recent visit! We came here for the dinner and got one of the combo deals. Everything was great, which included the steamed fish, the crispy chicken, snow pea leave, bok choy and scallops. The service was pretty standard and it looks like the place could use a renovation, but hey the food was good."}
{"text":"This is my go-to Dim Sum place because it's authentic with carts and has a variety of dim sum items for $2.60 a dish. The reason for my average score is because of price but other than that I love the food here!  On weekends it gets very busy and I highly recommend making reservations (yes they take them and you by pass the line!) When you make reservations and arrive at the restaurant, you won't have a table right away but have priority. (It's a trick I always use)  In addition, I suggest coming before 2PM if you like the cart concept because after that it is a à la carte."}
{"text":"What to try?  Gotta love Chinese restaurant's set dinners. When they have set dinners on special, that's even better! We had the lobster and crab dinner for 6 ppl. I loved the way they cook their lobster with the small fried fish and fried garlic, phenomenal taste! The crab was also very tasty and full of meat. I'd go for the seafood that's offered here at the restaurant. Can't go wrong!  Last tip?   If you can't read Chinese, always ask about the set dinners that they have going on. Sometimes it changes per week or per month and it's usually at a price that's great value for the food you get. Say anything special tonight? Any promotions going on that you have going in the Chinese newspaper??"}
{"text":"This would not be the first place I'd go for dim sum in terms of restaurant decor and atmosphere but the food is delicious! if you're looking for old fashion pushing cart dim sum this is the place to be! They bring out fresh batches of dim sum in carts.  As for clay pot rice dishes, they are so popular you line up near the kitchen and wait for the lady to bring out their dishes.  They also have dishes I haven't seen in other dim sum restaurants like fish maw chicken or deep fried shrimp dumpling.  Cheap, fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Good selection of dim sum, the price is very reasonable! Would not reccommend for dinner or lunch though."}
{"text":"To start with, I was sorely disappointed with the dimsum experience there.  This is my second time to this place, I had been there for dinner before and they had the best fried crab claw (and because I didn't have much cash then I only at a little the first time I went there).  Anyway I started with the ham-sui-kok.  Ordered two actually (that was a mistake) the quality was well below par.  I'd say it was just one below from a cheap bakery where I can get wads of this at a cheap rate.  Though still better than China Buffet King's.  I then ordered their deep fried, air-filled sesame balls.  It wasn't bad, but I had better ones.  Theirs was a bit over oiled.  It felt a bit yucky on my mouth.  I then had their deep fried shrimp paste tofu.  That one was quite good actually, their shrimp paste was better than most places I have eaten at.  So I made note of that.  I tried their Siaw Long Pao.  It was a different style than what I am used to as theirs had the soup outside the dumplings rather than inside when I get it at Ding Tai Fung.  Suffice to say I wasn't impressed.  At around this point, I think I realized anything with pork wasn't going to be good.  So I ordered some Shrimp Har Gaw and Shrimp Chung Fan, and those were good.  However, I think the MSG level were a bit high on those as when I got home I slept for 5 hours when it finally kicked in.  Overall my tummy was feeling bloated and my mouth was feeling wonky during the time of the meal, usually that's an indication to me that the food wasn't too good.  Apparently for this place, unlike other places I have been to, the bill must be taken by the suited folk, the middle class men (those that don't push the carts around) do not pick up the bill.  I had to wait a long while for the person to come by.  Or it could just be the sub-standard service I really should expect when going to a Chinese restaurant.  This is probably the last time I am coming here at least on my own volition and would not recommend this place to anyone.  I really hope the dim sum place at New Century opens up again.  For now if you are in the area just shift a little and go to Chung King."}
{"text":"I was told that this was one of the best dim sums in Toronto, so I had high expectations of this place! However, I find that there is not alot to review about this place because the lack of food that they had. To start off with, there was a huge line of people waiting to get in, luckily we could bypass it because we had a large group. The waitress gave me attitude when she asked me to move out of her way, but that's beyond the point (I thought  Canadians were supposed to be nice!). The shrimp dumplings they had were good, but they did not have seaame balls or sweet sao bows which are a MUST. We saw a platter of lo mein that we wanted, and literally saw another table take it. When we asked the waitress if we could get one, she flat out just said no with any explanation. Overall I was disappointed at the customer service and variety of food, and I hope this isn't representative of dim sums in Canada!"}
{"text":"The food just keeps going downhill. Today especially. The fried tentacles were good, the other dishes also seemed to have gotten smaller as well. We got the claypot rice and it was terrible. The rice has three different textures all in the same pot. There was undercooked, wet soggy, and extremely dry, didn't think that was even possible. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"This is easily the best bang for your buck dim sum place. I don't know of any dim sum restaurants in the York Region that could beat the quality for such a low price.   Pros: Cart dim sum - you know what you're getting without have to worry about reading Chinese menus; friendly and efficient staff - really good at making sure you get seated ASAP and if you don't see an item being pushed out, just ask them and they order it from the kitchen; really good value - all dim sum is at a fixed price after a certain time; special dishes from the kitchen come quickly; after 2pm there are no more carts so you do not have to worry about food getting cold/not enough customers so they don't bring out enough food; great variety of food; and everything tastes so good!  Cons: Often fully packed, especially during weekends from 11:30 to 1:30; flavours may be too strong for some; noticeable use of MSG; cleanliness of restaurant isn't very good but they're always busy and it's not a very big place so keep that in mind; a general criticism of Chinese restaurants but they will not hesitate to clean/vacuum right beside you after peak hours - leave before 2:15 and you'll be fine.  Overall, a very welcoming restaurant with good quality food that doesn't hurt your wallet. They give people who are non-familiar with dim sum an easy way to try different dishes."}
