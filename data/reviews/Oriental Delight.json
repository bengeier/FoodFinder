{"text":"I'd give them 4.5 if I could. Food was really good. Though the sweet and sour chicken could have been a larger portion compared to the accompanying rice. The beef noodles was a solid choice,the woman mentioned how proud they were to use this particular source of bean sprout. Hyping the perfect ripeness compared to many competing restaurants. They were good, they are also just bean sprouts so I don't know. Yes, some places have raw bean sprouts and I usually don't eat it. I will return to try more!"}
{"text":"The shrimp with lobster dish here was different than I expected. Didnt really taste any lobster, but that may be the reason it said \"with lobster sauce\". For $7.50 it was still tasty enough and they give you a big portion, although also a bit too much rice. Comes with soy milk or their daily soup. Not bad but not so great that I would choose to come to this foodcourt just to eat here."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good food court booth.  Though most of the items on the wall menu are Cantonese dishes, there is a big sign on the counter, up front in your face, promoting Shanghai varieties.  Therefore, I ordered a minced pork noodle ($5.50) lunch special that came with a soy drink.  The minced pork noodle was quite good.  The noodle was soft but not wimpy (good).  The pork was lean, tasty but not overly salty (some might prefer it more salty).  The cucumber slices were fresh and crispy (good).  The whole dish was of good portion for a lady.  It was good enough that I might order it again next time.

The lady at counter emphasized that their food was low in salt, oil and MSG.

Oriental Delight sells a good minced pork noodle at a good price.  Overall, 3.5 stars."}

Welcome back Oriental Delight!

Oriental Delight has occupied the spot of what used to be Wok's King (beside the closed down Van's BBQ) in the First Markham Place food court. Those of you might remember Oriental Delight closing down around 2008 in the food court. I forgot the exact location of where it originally was though.

We had the dan dan noodles (noodles with peanut sauce) and seafood noodle. The seafood noodle was reasonable for $6.50, however the dan dan noodles were way too watery. The peanut sauce was more like peanut soup, to be honest, and my mom wasn't delighted with her meal.

I don't see myself eating here much, as I'm generally satisfied with other places in the food court such as Magic Fusion, Pho Ling's, and occasionally Korean BBQ."}
{"text":"ordered the chef special beef noodle soup.

they ran out of the noodles so i had to either wait 15 minutes for the noodles or settle for the noodles they use for the shanghai noodle dish. i was starving, so i opted for the substitution.

at the time i was eating it, i didn't mind it at all, but i was blinded by hunger. it was about 2pm and i had not eaten a single thing all day up to this point.

the noodle substitution was disappointing. i can't pinpoint why, maybe i like thicker noodles? no pun intended.
the braised beef was not as tender as i was expecting, it was kinda dry to be honest. almost flakey lol.

at the time, it was fine cus u can't complain when ur starving but i wouldn't want to go back for it if there are other options around."}
