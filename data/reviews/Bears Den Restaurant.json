{"text":"One Thursday evening after work, I needed to meet up with a friend.    We decided to give the Bears Den a try, with neither of us having been before, but curiosity piqued by its location.    Located north of Calgary, in Bearspaw, this restaurant is a large stand alone building.   The exterior suggests a somewhat unique  experience awaits, and entry through the front doors confirms it.   Clearly a lot of expense went into developing the Bears Den.   The initial interior in fact doesn't suggest \"restaurant\" to me.  Rather, it wouldn't be out of place acting as the lobby of an exclusive, private, oilman's club.  That may or may not be your thing.  Large leather sofas sit in the center of this \"lobby,\" with one end leading to the restaurant, while the other, a lounge.   We dined in the restaurant as planned, but a peek into the lounge revealed a surprisingly large and sophisticated space.  Live jazz plays Fridays and Saturdays, and this definitely looks like a room to grab a drink with someone who appreciates finer things.    Interestingly, a \"Bow-Valley\" theme permeates this place, as opposed to the decor pretending to be from some other city.  Dinner began with a great cabernet, and an order of mussels as an appetizer.   The order of mussels was quite large - - plenty for two people.  They were also delicious, complemented by a tasty ginger broth.    For the main, I debated the bison prime rib vs. the strip loin, but ultimately opted for the latter.  It comes with your choice of 4 sauces.  I chose the peppercorn.  The steak was cooked as ordered, and the peppercorn sauce quite tasty.  However, I did find the steak to be an inferior cut.  A gristly band ran through some of it, meaning I left a number of pieces on my plate. That being said, it could have been a one-off, but for the ~ $40 entrée price, I would hope for a better cut.    As well, I think the entrée portions could be larger.  Overall, I found the service to be great, the ambiance sophisticated, and I respected the restaurant's goal of sourcing locally as much as possible.    The steak was a bit of a letdown, though, so I need to knock off points for that.  It just didn't meet expectations.  However, I did enjoy the experience enough to go back and hopefully provide an update with a better score.   Next time, I think cocktails in the lounge are in order."}
{"text":"Overpriced game meat! Everything is great at the Bear's Den and tailors to a specific taste. If you like Deer, Buffalo, and Duck it is worth checking out. The atmosphere is exquisite, and the service is wonderful; except a unnerving sense of disparity amongst the staff. Prices are high, but expected in a community like Bearspaw."}
{"text":"Enjoyed brunch here this morning. The buffet part is really small but they come around with different items. Food was really tasted. Would come back again.   Service was amazing. They really took good care of us here."}
{"text":"We came here for brunch with a large group of 7 people.  The buffet was $20, and was of the calibre that you could get for a $35 brunch buffet downtown.  The food consisted of at least half lunch items, so don't go if you are looking forward to JUST breakfast.  Most of the meal is served (as they described it) as \"Canadian dim sum\".  A few people at the table had been for brunch here before, and offered some really useful advice: only take a small serving from the buffet line.  The \"dim sum\" portion of the service starts after you have a serving from the buffet.  After the waiters had been around with all the other dishes, I was glad I had taken a small serving from the buffet!  The buffet had salad, fruit, a selection of cheeses, meats, bread and crackers plus scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, chicken, roast beef and an assortment of desserts.  It was a pretty decent buffet, but nothing mind-blowing. We sat down and began to eat before a whirlwind of servers were offering up additional dim sum items....  First up was Eggs Benny - both traditional and smoked salmon were offered, next a Cinnamon Apple French Toast topped with marscapone, (at this point I was not eating fast enough to make room for the new food and I was suddenly thankful for the space on my side bread plate)...next Crispy Duck Spring Rolls with house hot sauce, then Chorizo Flatbread pizza..(at this point my food was getting stacked 2 layers deep - I had to start saying no!)... but yes to the Lamb Meatball skewers with roasted tomato and mushrooms... Thankfully at this point we had finished the list of dim sum items and began eating at a rate that exceeded how fast food was being added to our plates!  This probably isn't the best place for people with food allergies or strong preferences, because you really have no idea what you will get.  The dim sum items change weekly, so you need to be prepared for whatever adventure the chef has planned!  Also, most of the dim sum items only came around just once, so don't be too shy to say yes the first time!  Review #1 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012"}
{"text":"Bears Den give the feeling of Midwest Cowboys days the decor is just awesome in this place. If you are there I suggest you walk through the entire place checking out the walls. The owner of this restaurant really takes pride of ownership to heart. This Resturant has the rustic Midwest feel and look when inside its kind of like a small Castle tall ceiling high walls.  You can tell from the gate outside to the sign, the doors as you walk in its just all around impressive high end luxury restaurant. The decor will make you think only meats. But you are in for more than just a surprise. I bring clients and family here often and they never disappoint.  You will always get great food here. Top quality beef, choices of seafood, and sometime game meats. with fresh vegetables.. Deserts are nicely done as well. If you save room. I had ordered game meats before such as Elk, Bison and, venison it was cooked rare to perfection with just the right flavour of sauce to compliment the meat. Presentation was very nice and clean. The smell of the meats as you cut it is just mouth watering.  I had sea bass and salmon and I aways order it medium as I alway want to preserve the original flavour and juices of the meat. It's was also nicely done and presented."}
{"text":"Travel to the NW reaches of Calgary and then keep going. Just outside the city limits next to the highway lies this incongruous restaurant and lounge - the outside looks like a community hall with a homemade sign and the inside appointed like an elite New York social club.   Let me start by saying that the service was exemplary from the moment we walked in the door. My parents have visited a couple of times before, so we were greeted warmly by name by the manager Tim  and the wait staff. Friendly, professional, attentive and accommodating best describes the service we received throughout our meal.  The Bears Den's wine list has won the Award of Excellence from Wine Spectator for the last 7 years with good reason, their selection Included wines from small production \"boutique\" wineries that were of very high quality. We left with a few names written down that we will be looking for in the wine store.  We chose to dine in the lounge as opposed to their dining room so we could partake in their Sunday evening buffet. My initial reaction was that the offerings in the buffet were rather pedestrian, but fitting for a fine dining establishment. With the exception of one dish, which was dry, all were prepared nicely and were tasty but really nothing to write home about.  But then came the servers tableside carrying trays of amuse bouche/dim sum: mini salmon & asparagus crepes, tiny lamb chops, bison meatballs, a Thai inspired jumbo prawn, halibut \"fish & chip\", steak & lobster skewers, mini Yorkshire puddings filled with roast beef.  Wow! That is when the food got elevated to 5 stars!  I now know why they called this place the Bears Den. After you finish eating their buffet you just want to loosen your waistband and go hibernate!"}
{"text":"Seated in the lounge, but you can choose from both menus.  Started with a beer flight.  Had the duck duo for dinner.  The duck breast was awesome, however the Duck confit crepes were just okay.  Their bread and butter were wicked."}
{"text":"I remember the Bear's Den when it used to be great. Now it has a new owner and a new chef.  Boy, have they got a lot of work to do.  The menu has few selections.  The entre sizes are inconsistent.  One plate looked like a trucker's special, and the other plate at our table looked more like an appetizer.  The mea was over-cooked and dry. The pastry on the tart served for dessert was hard and tasteless like it came out of an easy bake oven.  This was not a good night out."}
{"text":"Last night we decided to forgo driving downtown and headed out to the Den. Having been there recently we were excited to return. This time though it was a drink at the bar and live jazz with some dancing.   Ordered an amazing bottle of wine for $33, excellent wine and excellent value. Added a couple of appetizers to nibble on, the cheese plate and charcuterie board. Both delicious and nicely prepared.   The new chef is a graduate of the SAIT culinary program and it shows.   The Bears Den has changed somewhat over the years. The pretentiousness is gone and the service is excellent. Excellent options on the menu at multiple price points. It is a great place to stop in for a drink at the bar or for a 5 course meal.   If you haven't been there since the redo last summer. Take a drive west of the city, you won't be disappointed. Ask for Al, he runs the bar."}
{"text":"Went there with my boyfriend on Saturday and the food was okay, nothing super spectacular.   After we ate each course they congratulated us on finishing... Not sure what they were expecting us of, felt a bit like a child in class.  When the dessert menu came we looked at it and made our choice of the lemon strawberry tart (a little too sweet). The waitress came back and assumed that we weren't having any because we'd closed the menus. I would think that the response would have been \"So did you find anything that ticked your fancy\" or something along those lines.   When we arrived for our reservations at 6pm they were playing the music pretty loud. And not really the kind of music one would expect from that kind of restaurant (i.e. Barenaked Ladies).  The service was good, not 100% sure if we'll be going back. It sounds like most people go there for special occasions, but I'm not sure I'd pick there for a special dinner."}
{"text":"Bear's Den recently added brunch to their offerings.  I have never been to Bear's Den before so this review is strictly based on my brunching experience.  First of all, despite the name, no bears.  I was worried because this place is like an HOUR from my house, or as I like to say, where the wild things live.  The absence of bears was appreciated.  Decor is nice, but kind of reminds me of a place where men go to smoke cigars and drink scotch and women aren't admitted because of some dumb rule from the 50's or something.  The buffet was rather anemic and reminded me of a garage sale when all the good stuff is gone.  We were all surprised at the lack of options and the fact that they were not refreshing any of the food.  (Later we were told it's because our reso was so late - it was dead when we arrived but we when we made our reso we were told they were packed until 1pm.)  We got back to the table and made jokes about turning this into a liquid brunch when our server started coming around with hot food from the kitchen - eggs bennies, bison skewers, spring rolls, all sorts of delights.  Everything she brought around was MILES ahead of the sad spread that we picked through looking for any last morsel of food.  If you've read my review on Crack Bun, you know I like a good cinnamon bun.  The warm cinnamon buns she brought around were fresh from the oven, dripping in gooey sugary, cinnamon-y deliciousness.  I un-apologetically had two of them (what if I got stuck in the wilderness, far from my house, I would need the sustenance) and wished I had brought a container to smuggle some home with me.  Bottom line - go early, don't fill your plate at the \"buffet\", ask for the cinnamon buns, and make sure the pants you wear are stretchy at the waist.  If you do these things I feel confident you will best my 3 star experience by at least 1 full star."}
{"text":"I am positively surprised about this place.... It is in the middle of nowhere, but is really beautiful!! And all the food was good... The appetizers were delicious, we the main course was great!!.. I had the duck and I can definitely recommend it to anyone!!.. The halibut was very good too...The wine was great!! The desserts delicious and the service not bad at all..."}
{"text":"Bear's Den is just a few minutes north of our home. Out of the hustle and bustle, but, easy to get to. Every time we go, the crew at the Den are friendly and sincerely want us to enjoy ourselves. Good food. Good people. Nice room. They close in August for holidays, so we're going to have to visit a few times before then. Some of the staff moved on and when they reopened after the summer break,  the service had declined significantly and the food had lost its flair. This restaurant has since closed."}
