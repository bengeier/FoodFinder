{"text":"This is a nice neighbourhood place, with tasty food, reasonable portions and prices.  Nothing fancy, but reliable and friendly.  Cuisine is Vietnamese with some Thai, Singapore and Malaysian dishes.  My favourite is the vermicelli with grilled pork, fried spring roll.  My son likes the pho.  My other son loves curry brisket beef with roti."}
{"text":"Our go-to pho place in the neighbourhood. Fast service and quality is consistent.  Take out is fast as well! We love their curry and roti, grilled chicken + spring roll vermicelli, and their rare beef pho (broth is decent and always piping hot)."}
{"text":"Very disappoint from last two visits. I paid 10 bucks for a large bowl of noodles. It was not that way in the past. I won't go there again and there are many restaurant just a few minutes away."}
{"text":"I like their hainanese chicken, as it comes de-boned like it should be.  Their morning glory veggie (tung choi) is yummy too.  Pho is gOod.  Beef, chicken versions okay, but their seafood version is  lacking seafood!    Malay curry is good too, usually go for the chicken."}
{"text":"Poor manners from the waitresses turns everything off. Food is just average. Not completely authentic Vietnamese."}
{"text":"Price is reasonable. Location is very convenient.  We usually get the Pho and Malasian Curry with Roti (if you haven't tried it yet, it's one of the hidden gems of this restaurant!)   Service - it depends on who's on duty, but the past few times I've been there, they've been really good. I would say the service has definitely improved from before."}
{"text":"I was a regular Customer to this restaurant because I live in the area. I go there Almost twice a week.  Last time I went and ordered Curry Chicken Roti. The amount of Curry Sauce was So little. I asked for a little more sauce for my son the owner was very nasty and turned US down right off the back. Curry sauce is very inexpensive. The amount of sauce they provide is really insufficient for the Roti. I was only getting enough for My plate not extra At all.  Since that I never went back again?Do Not like their service and attitude."}
{"text":"Lousy service. We had a big group of 20 people. Restaurant wasn't busy at all. There were few empty tables. We sat down and waiting for our 2 more members. The server with an attitude asked if the 2 members are still coming because they don't want us to take up the table. First of all, it wasn't busy. Secondly,  the server needs some training on how to speak to their customers.  They should appreciate our business instead they are trying to make us want to leave. Will never go back. If there us an option to give zero star I would."}
{"text":"Cost: reasonable Quality: good - 80% Decor: average - 75% Staff: almost no service - 70% Value: 80%  Keeper? Yes, it's better than Pho 99 further south on McCowan. Must order their roti (or roti canai). We go there regularly so on average you should expect what I have rated above. For those who have only been there once and happened to hit the low, too bad. So I guess they are a bit inconsistent? But I find it to be ok. There's only Kim Dinh and Pho 99 in this area when you crave for Vietnamese food.  This place and Pho 99 are certainly much better than Xe Lua Vietnamese Cuisine, which I don't go anymore."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a close-to-home Vietnamese place, this is it. It has everything from shrimp rolls to Malaysian curry to your regular Pad Thai and Pho. We came in quite late (9PM) but the service was very prompt and everything was hot. The shrimp rolls were great with peanut sauce (the sauce was a little light) and the Pad Thai had great flavour (shrimp, chicken, tofu). Their noodles were a bit softer than I'm used to, but that's my only complaint. The pho (Rare beef; small) was good with the usual beef broth. The size perfect for 1-2 people.  If it's one thing I'd come back for, it's the curry and roti. We ordered Malaysian curry with roti and it was blessed. The roti was light and perfectly cooked and the curry hit just the spot!   Definitely will be revisiting when I'm in the area and craving for Pho."}
{"text":"Very unaccommodating. We came in a semi large group and very unaccommodating seating us together. They would not let us move 2 tables together. This isn't some fancy restaurant where they have some elitist image to keep. It's your run of the mill, a dime a dozen cheap pho hole in the wall. I'd give them a zero star rating if the app would let me."}
{"text":"Food Quality & Price: The quality of the pho is good and dishes are fairly priced.  An added bonus is that the bowl they serve the noodles in are heat resistant so you will not burn yourself when you touch it.   Recommended Tried and True Dishes: - Pho (any kind) - Pho with added Thai Spicy - Curry Beef/Chicken on Rice - Lemongrass Chicken/Pork on Rice  Facility: A typical pho place. It's not great, washroom are usable by a margin.  There is a television playing shows in Chinese. In the winter, despite there being a double door entrance, there is a gaping area at the top where the cold can get in. I'm assuming this is for ventilation? But it's not good if you have to sit by the door in the cold winter months.   Service: This was a great place to go when you're on the run or if you live near by. However, having lived in the area for many years, I have visited many, many times and I must say that the experience has been a steady decline. [[Old Experience: At the beginning, there was a woman (late 30s) who worked there and always looked grumpy, however, she was efficient and attentive.  At a recent visit, our young waitress in a ponytail and glasses (kind of chubby) looked at me when I waved for her attention and then walked away.  As my mother tried to get her attention, said girl stopped, looked, then waved my mother off saying \"Later.\" Other waitresses came to pick up her slack!  I was not only appalled by the lack of professionalism but that she was serving tables that arrived after we did! She lacked priorities, manners and common sense. If this girl cannot be trained, she needs to be fired.]] New Experience: Both these staff members no longer work there. Instead, there are two young girls (Shirley with the industrial piercing and Maria with the glasses). Both girls are daughters of the owners and they work hard. They're very obviously invested into the business and care about customer service. Both girls are efficient and attentive. They are bilingual (speak both Chinese and English) and are always scanning the room to see if anyone needs anything (often picking up the slack of the other wait staff).  Overall: [[Old Experience: Already scoring an average mark across the board as a passable place to eat, it is because of the declining quality of the service and experience that our family has decided to take our repeat dining elsewhere.  Generally, if you're starving for cheap pho, it's not a bad place to go.  But be prepared for disappointing service, if you want mint, lemon or hot peppers, you'll have to ask or they won't even bring it.]]  Second Edit: After hearing from neighbours that the service quality had picked up slightly, my family and I decided to give Kim Dinh another chance. We went on a weekday evening for dinner. Sure enough, our waitress was courteous, respectful and efficient. It really did seem like she was the only one working the floor. Depending on future visit(s) I may or may not revise my rating of this establishment.  Right now it's sitting at a 2.5/5.  Final Edit: After returning many times, I'm convinced that the girls do read their Yelp reviews. Service has drastically improved (no matter time of day or day of the week). I am very pleased to see that they've raised their own expectations and this is clearly reflected in the number of patrons. Most nights, Kim Dinh is packed and full with decent turn over time. I will now be revising my rating for Kim Dinh from 2 stars to 4 stars. We are repeat customers because we live so close and are very glad that they have improved since their opening."}
{"text":"There is absolutely nothing Vietnamese about this place! I had the fook kien noodle and it taste nothing like what is suppose to be...soup base was terrible a few PCs of BBQ pork over the soup. My son had the lemon grass chicken on rice and they use regular white rice not broken rice The wife had spring roll vermicelli and she said it was the worst spring-roll ever, and no mint leaves or basil  Who da hell serve this dish without mint leave or basil!  Never come back again that's for sure!"}
{"text":"I love Kim Dinh, it has really delicious food, large servings, great Roti and Pho. My one recommendation is to come for lunch or a weeknight dinner because it's small and the servers are, well, not super attentive."}
{"text":"Excellent service, food was good, servers are very accommodating to special requests. Food came up fast and was hot and fresh. All in all no complaints, hidden gem of the area."}
{"text":"Went to Kim Dinh on a weekday evening and it was pretty busy. Most, if not all the tables were occupied. Promptly got seated and was given a cup of warm tea.  They have a pretty extensive menu, ranging from rice dishes, pho, vermicelli, curry, and appetizers. It wasn't my first time here so I ordered rare beef & beef flank pho, and also the grilled chicken & spring roll vermicelli. The prices are very reasonable ($8) for each dish. The food came very quickly, which was great because I was starving after work!  The food itself is okay, not the best vietnamese food in Markham. However, the location is close to home and is convenient. Overall, I like the vermicelli dish more, because I find the soup base could be better on the pho. If you are looking for a quick bite at a reasonable price, Kim Dinh is a good option."}
{"text":"* Pho is average * Place looks clean * Average priced * Average service and can get very busy at times"}
{"text":"I have gone to the restaurant twice so far.  I've tried their pad thai, Malaysian curry with roti, and Tom yum.  They are all pretty good. Their shakes are good as well.  I haven't tried their pho yet. I've managed to get seated right away the times I've gone. The service is as expected.  It's passable. The decor is not there. The water tastes kinda funny.  Overall, I would go back for lunch."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a while ever since high school! And this place serves awesome pho!! For pretty decent prices $8.00 for large and its actually huge!!  I ordered a few dishes before and they are all really delicous  but a little bit on the oily side.  Overall good place to grab pho if you are around !! And service is not bad either !"}
{"text":"Pleasant place to get Pho and other great dishes. Fav is the curry beef with roti and the deep fried chicken appetizer. It is always so crispy and freshly made."}
{"text":"The pho it's self isn't bad at all, very little msg, decent meat/ home made meat balls.   The problem with this place is the service, there is noooo service ! I would only come back if I was super desperate for pho. it's nice to have your drink topped off or be spoke to with respect. It could have been worse, but it could have been MUCH better!   For what ever reason the spring roll was a little off as well almost a slight taste of curry, and a few things I don't normally find In my spring roll, I didn't like it and my friend found it odd too.     SERVICE IS KEY!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here many times. They rush you to order and they keep walking near your table to see if you are done, so that they can take your plates and rush you out.   This is NOT a place to hang out with your friends if you plan on talking for more than 1 hour.   FOOD: Average.   VERDICT: It's  for a quick eat and go. They expect you to eat quick and leave."}
{"text":"Worst service ever.  We order the vermicelli and the noodles were all very smushy.  The food is normally ok so we gave them the benefit of the doubt and just asked for a new bowl.  Initially they apologized and took the bowl back, but another young waitress decided to come back to us and proceed to say \"this is how our noodles are....\"  Apparently bad food should be expected at this place, along with bad service."}
{"text":"The food was bland and their water tasted off. The service can also be better. Won't go back."}
{"text":"Offers a good variety of Vietnamese foods at a good price. Small family run business with friendly staff and good service."}
{"text":"Ordered chicken curry takeout from this place. I can hardly believe for $15 there were less than 5 pieces of chicken and hardly a spoonful of sauce given. I thought the box had opened when I was driving and spilled my food. But NO, the amount of food given was ridiculously small and just pitiful... Not coming to this place again."}
{"text":"When I lived in the area, I would always come by during the cold evenings of winter. I came not only because it was close, but their consistency in quality really hit home. I make pho once in a while at home and I have to say it taste like how I like it to be. It's not perfect.. I have tasted better soup base else where (hwy 27/finch area), but I feel like home when I have the noodles here. Can't exactly explain what I feel when I eat here. Yes, the service isn't inspiring but food quality has not changed since they first opened 5-6 years back. Come to think about it, this place has been around for quite a while.. And for it to continue business throughout these years clearly shows why.  I always get their beef brisket pho.. Closest thing to heaven I have ever tasted. It's always tender and juicy (probably bc of the soup lol). The only change I would recommend is the noodles - it's always too soft. It is probably because I don't ask for \"dry noodles\" (say that in chinese).. So make sure you ask for dry noodles - it's the thin noodles :)  -1 star because of service"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with my family today. Food was bad and service was terrible. There might as well be no server at all. We waited for 15 minutes before we get our drinks then an other 20 minutes before they take our orders. We ordered their specialty pho. It took 30 minutes for the food to arrive. Not only the pho came with noodles still sticking together. I called the server over and ask for an exchange and they said their noodles are serve like that. I like pho but I never had a pho with noodles sticking together. I used to think this place was good but not any more. Their service has definitely gone down the slop. I had a $35 lunch with my family. I gave them $1 tip for their uncook noodes and their poor services and the 1hour and 5minutes wait. The server came back to me with the cash tray wanting to ask for more tip. I told her I would not tip them any more for my poor experience today. Then the server gave me a look. Overall, I had a very poor experience at this resturant. I don't think I woukd return to this resturant again. Very disappointing not to their food but the long wait and the services."}
{"text":"My family and I like this place because it's nearby. Their pad thai is probably my favourite dish. I love the firm tofu in it and it's the perfect amount of sweet and savoury. The pad thai comes with both chicken and shrimp for one price ($9.99) and a lot of other places make you choose one or the other or pay more to have both included. Their pho, vermicelli, curries, and pork chop dishes are good too. Their green curry is so yummy and has just the right amount of coconut flavour in it. There's also a generous amount of chicken (or whatever protein you decide to get, I suppose). Service is meh, but I never expect much from places like these. Sometimes you get a server that will crack a smile at you and other times, you'll get a server that looks like she would rather be doing anything else but working there. Totally random side note, but their take out boxes are pretty nice. Lol. Whenever we get take out, we keep the boxes so we can give leftovers to friends and relatives without losing our Tupperware."}
{"text":"Like the service as it is fast and somewhat friendly. It is not authentic Vietnamese cuisine; the servers spoke Cantonese. The food is a mixture of Malaysian, Vietnamese, and Chinese cuisine. We got a big bowl of noodle soup between two people, two curry dishes, and another noodle soup. Again, fast and tasty. Liked the mango slushy."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and it's been consistently good.  The place has good flow of people coming in for take out and to dine in. Decent food and it's always fresh."}
{"text":"Malaysian Roti Curry, (incredible), as well as the Beef/pork chicken spring rolls.  Best in the city (both of these).  I will literally drive from Toronto to have this meal :).  However, business ownership (a little on the crude straight forward) not customer service oriented and not super friendly.  pretty straight forward, like YOU EAT, and You LEAVE lol, don't expect extras LOL.  Its a shame but, at the end of the day, I would come back because it;'s a casual place, not something you can have high standards about in terms of service, but if you want GOOD food, its good!!!"}
{"text":"Haven't been in ages and the reason for this review is probably why. Don't get me wrong, the staff were pleasant however it's freezing inside! The layout of the place is not good. Cold air keeps coming in and out once people leave and come in. I tried their house special pho. It was very salty and did not taste home made. I felt like there was a lot of msg and salt in it. I will not be coming back unfortunately."}
{"text":"Poor service and not accommodating. We came in with a group of 8 people at 9:00pm. The restaurant was not all that busy but they  did not allow us to move the tables together even when there is space available. They are very unaccommodating for larger groups. It is not even a fancy place and even normal places would accommodate larger groups. The two servers there acted like they do not care and did not offer us any help or suggestions other then saying no. Very poor service. Would not go there again. If I can rate them zero, I would."}
{"text":"Smack-dab in the suburbs of Markham, Kim Dinh is a decent place to go to for Vietnamese cuisine. I've been here a couple of times and the speedy service never disappoints.   We ordered two large ($8.00 vs $7.00 for small) House Special Noodle Soup - rare beef, brisket, tendon, beef balls, and tripe. The soup was satisfying - although not the best I have ever tasted, it's a good substitute for those looking for a good bowl of pho. The meat was good and came in good amounts - not too much and definitely not too little. And, as usual, they came with a side of kint leaves, lime, and bean sprouts. One large bowl is enough to feed one very  hungry person or two smaller appetites.  We also ordered Tsz Soo Basil Mussels ($11.75) - this was a dish I hadn't tried before and I was surprised at how good the flavours came together - salty (in a good amount) with a bit of a spice to it.  I would definitely recommend this dish.   Overall, Kim Dinh is a good place to go to for pho and it's one of the good pho places in the area - and there aren't many within a short driving distance. The service is great - fast and polite, the cleanliness of the place is good, and the flavours are there."}
{"text":"Kim Dinh is properly one of the better viet restaurants in Markham.  Their beef noodle soup is always consistent because of their soup base and tender beef (I usually go with cooked beef)  Spring rolls are also well fried with lots of ingredients wrapped inside!  Curry and Roti here is also one of their signature items on the menu!  Only downfall for this restaurant is the horrendous customer service, but with the quality of food and the relatively cheap price they charge, I didn't care about the bad customer service much.   If you want a cheap viet meal in Markham, I highly recommend trying Kim Dinh."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 bowls of pho on a Sunday afternoon for a table of 3. All the servers seemed to be very annoyed and constantly talked among themselves. The food itself was great - rich soup base and the beef cooked perfectly. The price is typical of a pho place ($6-7 for a bowl). They do have rice and other small appetizers, but we didn't try those out, since we just wanted a little bit of food.  Would not return, purely because of their terrible service."}
{"text":"This is literally 5 mins away from home and the smart thing is there isn't another Viet restaurant without driving another 5-10 mins down to Hwy 7. So I come here when I'm craving for Viet food.  The quality is considered to be OK, the soup base, the noodles and etcc...The large bowl is pretty big. Priced at $7.50. If you are not a big eater, share one bowl and it will fill both of you.  The service is not very good. The girls are the boss's daughters and they are quite cocky. They are lucky they serve yummy curry or else I will not go back.  I have to give credit for the yummilicious curry they serve. It's cooked close to my perfection level. Smells awesome, taste great and portion wise is perfect to share..=D  It gets quite busy on weekends. Gotta be patient.."}
{"text":"I would recommend the lemongrass pork chop rice - very flavourful! The Tom Yum Chicken Noodle is very good as well - I love the soup!   The rare beef pho was good, tender beef (sliced slightly thicker than the paper-thin hotpot variety). Curry chicken roti - decent but chicken was dry, needs more curry! - finished the sauce before the roti."}
{"text":"Lmao so this place is was my child hood so I decided to give it another go.   Like I said before the pho is hit or miss. This time I went they were on point. Noodle portion was good and the beef looked like it had been sitting on the counter for a few hours rather than a few days. If u have a pho craving it's not the worst choice...definitely better the pho Quinn  If ordering anything other than pho the best choices are the Indonesian fried chicken and the chicken curry with roti. Roti is blessed as it's always soft and chewy. They leave the skin on the chicken curry which while it flavourful makes it look like BP had another accident. It does tend to have that prepackaged powdery taste...but maybe that's part of the nostalgia. The fried chicken reminded me why I prefer it to Popeyes (but thats personal preference)   Anyways it was good to come back."}
{"text":"I live close by and I do come here. But not for pho. Soup base is not that great.  But rice and other dishes are good."}
{"text":"Got my usual rare beef and tripe pho ($7.75). I got the large size which did come in a big bowl but sadly it was more like a small to me. The beef was already fully cooked when served so it wasn't really rare. Very little meat :(  The deep fried spring rolls wasn't any better ($4.75 I think). They had a burnt flavour to them and had a really hard outer shell like it was deep fried too long. They were stuffed with alot of noodles and very little meat.  Service was very fast and I was actually really surprised how fast the food arrived. It took about 2 minutes for the pho to arrive."}
{"text":"Pho and Malaysian in one  We go here often. Our favorites: - fish cakes appetizer - flavorful and colorful - chicken curry roti - nice soft bread and good body without too much spice - pho - enjoyable and well made The service is fast, the room fills up quickly as it is a popular place for a decent price."}
{"text":"???????????? ???????? ?????? ???, ?????????Not bad noodle soup. But quality not consistent. Hope the restaurant can maintain its quality because it is within the neighborhood and very convenient for my family."}
{"text":"This place has thus far been a hit and miss for me.  It is however still better than the Pho place in Stouffville though.  The first time, I ordered a grilled pork bun and it was quite good despite the insane amount of bean sprouts they had.  The next time I went, I had ordered a shredded pork bun and it was very flavourless.  I had also asked specifically to NOT have any bean sprouts and they still put it in, which really ruined it.  I ordered a soy milk as well under the assumption they make it in house - and they gave me a Yeo's can of soy milk - definitely not worth the $3 I paid for it.  Overall, I'd say that while this place isn't inedible, I wouldn't go here deliberately.  I still like Pho Metro way more!"}
{"text":"Small, family owned and a Good pho place that offers a wide variety of choices. Pho noodle is good, love the Indonesian fried chicken.   Noticed serving got smaller."}
{"text":"Ordered house pho, Indonesian fried rice, spring roll and grilled chicken vermicelli.   First time ordering vermicelli bowl dish in Vietnamese restaurant, which tastes so awesome that made me determine this is going to be my new go-to dish in any future Vietnamese restaurant. Unsure if the dish is awesome or it's just that this dish tastes good in this restaurant. Will find out in future as I order more vermicelli bowls.  House pho had a very flavourful and non greasy broth.   If you are looking for something lighter in taste, no greasy, no spicy dishes, and happen to live close by, i would recommend this place to you."}
{"text":"One of my fav Pho places! Not sure about the recent bad reviews, but i've been going here for the last 3-4 years.  Compared to the other Pho restaurants in Markham area, i prefer this place.  Pho is has been pretty much consistant, as also the other dishes on their menu. Service is back and forth as mentioned.  Lots of parking, can be busy on weekends around 6:30pm."}
{"text":"Kim Dinh is a Vietnamese restaurant that has a large menu.  My girlfriend and I have gone to this place at least five times now and they're consistently up to par.  I'm pretty boring and get vermicelli with chicken every time and it's always really good.  It's constantly of the same quality every time and I really do like it.  I'm not entirely sure what they cook their chicken it has an amazing flavour to it.  My girlfriend usually gets something different and she's been pleased with almost everything.  She did get chicken skewers once and, while the chicken was the same excellent quality, the other sauce they put on it wasn't a good combination to go with it at all.  The service is alright for the most part.  Service is extremely quick so it's perfect if you're going there while on your lunch break during work hours.  This place usually have two or three waitresses wandering around at any given time and they're pretty nice.  My only complaint is that they try to speak to me in Cantonese after I tell them I don't speak it, multiple times on the same visit.  The place itself is very clean and well kept.  There aren't places for large groups so if there's more than four of you, you may want to go elsewhere - especially if they're as unaccommodating as other Yelpers have been saying.  As for parking, you may have to park on the other side of the island outside the door (a little closer to Fresh Co.) since there are several businesses in that plaza and not a ton of parking for each place.  It's not much of a walk anyway.  Kim Dinh's a good place to go for lunch or dinner with a small group for a quick bite to eat.  Their service is really fast and the quality of their food is pretty good.  I could recommend this place, at least for one visit.  Edit: I'm not sure why, but their food quality has dropped off a little since I started coming here about a year ago.  Their chicken doesn't taste nearly as good as it used to and my girlfriend's curry-flavoured noodle-soup hasn't been impressive either.  Service is still solid and they're still quick though so it's still a good place to go for if you're working in the area and you want a quick lunch.  Probably closer to a 3.5/5 but I'll leave it at 4/5 Stars."}
{"text":"When in need for some pho in your life kim dins an ok place to go. Small shack that looks clean. Servers are pleasant food comes out quick.  Pho is ok ,spring rolls too. They offer other stuff too but i just stick with these two items.  And the occasional lemongrass proteins  I just remember kim din slightly better tasting that what it is now."}
{"text":"I came here because I was desperate for pho and I've already gotten tired of Pho Quinn and too scared to try 88 LOL  I'm a little glad I came tonight though. This is your typical Vietnamese restaurant that is ran by Chinese people.  I got here around 5PM and it was fairly quiet with one or 2 tables being taken.  We were seated, ordered (your average menu), and got served my food within 10 minutes.  I ordered the satay beef and my boyfriend got the large befe tendon pho.  The satay beef is very average ... it was nothing to be dreaming about but it did it's job.  I was super, super, super hungry and it was satisfying to the point of where it wasn't bland but the taste didn't really hit me like I expected.  It was like a soupy, bland version of the original flavour.  PLUS there was NOT enough beef for a large soup.. I have 6 pieces of beef and a BIG handful of noodles?????  My boyfriend's pho was actually pretty legit for a Chinese ran restaurant.  It wasn't crazy good but at least the flavour was somewhat authentic.  Overall the place seems clean enough, the food here is good enough, but the price here is a dollar or $2 more than the usual.   PS. They do take visa and debit over $15."}
{"text":"Pretty nice place to eat.  Try their lemongrass pork or chicken, it's pretty good.  Their snacks are pretty nice too.    They offer takeout as well.  Good place for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Kim Dinh is up at McCowan and Bur Oak in the same plaza as Sobey's.  I ordered a Large Pho with raw beef and tripes.   The soup was not hot!  The soup was super salty! (I was thirsty for the whole evening after eating this! tons of MSG!) The noodle was the dried type! (and not really prepared well) The raw beef is really quite raw.. but not because they want to prepare it that way, just because the soup is not hot enough to cook them properly! The tripe was the worse part of the meal.. It was in big chunks and just throw on top of the noodles with no preparation. Just like something they just got from the open tub from the Chinese supermarket!   They really not specialized in vietnamese cuisine.. There are thai, malaysian dish in the menu.   No lunch Special!  They accepts VISA and MC for orders over $10"}
{"text":"Kim Dinh is a small family run business located in the freshCo plaza on McCowan and Bur Oak. There is usually plenty of parking spots in this plaza even on weekends. I have been to Kim Dinh on several occasions and tried a number of their menu items. The service is usually very fast and friendly and you are seated fairly quickly. I also noticed that staff keep this place very clean and tidy which is a plus for me. I normally order the Malaysian curry with Roti ($9.25) which I would have to say is one of their best menu items here. It is very consistent and the roti is fresh and soft. It is perfect for dipping into the addicting sauce that leaves you craving for more even after you have finished. The portion is a little on the skimpier side and sometimes I am trying to hunt for the chicken in the sauce. I have also had their regular Pho with rare beef ($7.00). There is nothing spectacular about this, the broth is a little on the less flavorful side. I have also tried their drinks such as the Vietnamese coffee and the iced coconut milk with grass jelly and red beans. I would definitely not recommend any of their drinks as they are very watered down and tasteless.   Overall it is a very average restaurant, but if you are in the area give the Malaysian curry with Roti a try!"}
{"text":"Went to this place because we were craving a red curry chicken. Placed order to go total cost for the dish with no rice was $13. Got home thinking container seems small AND behold it was and it was lacking CHICKEN and TASTE what a wast of $13 should have gone to Babu or Tastee across the plaza. NEVER GOING BACK TO THIS PLACE OVER PRICED AND LACKING IN PORTIONS."}
{"text":"There's not a lot of Pho places around this area.... This is the only one my family goes to (the other one in Pine Tree plaza was closed, then reopened, but it's not good)  My brother loves this place!   I enjoy the pho restaurants (except Pho 88) in Mississauga so much more. At Kim Dinh (my coworker's name is Kimsa Dinh tehe), the pho is not very flavourful and the soup is not super hot. The spring rolls are meh.  We had roti and curry one day, and it was surprisingly pretty good!"}
{"text":"I was hoping to give this place another chance yet sadly it's about the same.  There's nothing wrong with the food but it's just when you have eaten at other Vietnamese places that are so much better, you expect more.  The spring rolls are what you would find in Chinese take out.  The crust is very thick and not the Vietnamese dough that would be used which is much thinner. Rice dishes were quite good.  Noodles were ok althought the broth for pho is very tasty.  Overall for Markham, it's fine.  It's Vietnamese run by Chinese.  If you want Vietnamese food run by Vietnamese, you have to venture about 15-20 mins out.  Helps if you speak Cantonese or Mandarian.  Friendly service."}
