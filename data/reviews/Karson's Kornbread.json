{"text":"The atmosphere is nice. Located in the lobby/restaurant area of the Ramada. Put a to go order in and it took the right amount of time to know it wasn't rushed. Ordered breakfast which was good chicken was seasoned well. Only complaint is from a beverage stand point didn't have lemonade and the sweet tea was not prepared(12. Good spot and friendly hours definitely will be back to try the dinner menu and happy hour. 

Updated review went back 1/19/18 got served moldy sweet potato pie ask for slightly fried hard Tilapia and if you know how to fry fish you know what happens when you fry it to long."}
{"text":"How disappointed I was to spend $9.00 for 4 juicy chicken strips. Size wise they were more like tenders and more dry than tender. The Chicago style dipping sauce was good.  If you are going to put Kornbread in your title, best that it be good and a good sized portion. It was hard, dry and rather tasteless. Service was attentive."}
{"text":"Karson Kornbread customer service is great! Food comes out fast!!! The bartender Lisa was attentive! They also have a server named Rosie that treats all customers like family!!"}
{"text":"Great servers, food, atmosphere, ***ill be back! Come on Phoenix! Very nice people all the food mybgroup tried was great! Turkey bacon turkey sausage, fried fish & fried chicken......Thin waffles! Go try it asap! On corner of 2nd Ave Osborn can't miss it!"}
{"text":"Just Like Family!
Our friend suggested Karson's Kornbread for brunch. We had passed the long line at LoLo's and were too hungry to wait. My husband and I are so glad we did. 

Living in L.A. we don't play about our food. Not only was the food good (Fish, Shrimp, Chicken, and my fave the Jalapeño cornbread), but the service made us feel right at home. 

We ordered a Strawberry drink hand poured by the owner (it's strong). Not only did he make it, but brought it over to our table TWICE. He told us how he named the restaurant after his beautiful daughter. He was really down to earth and whenever we return to Phoenix, his restaurant will be our first stop! Thx Tony!"}
{"text":"I love Shrimp and Grits.  I ordered shrimp and grits for lunch.  This was not tasty.  The grits had no taste, they were watery.  It had no seasoning.  Please consider removing from the menu or revise the recipe."}
{"text":"They seemed as if they were distracted beyond belief. Trying to pull off a soul food restaurant in the lobby of an old Holiday Inn certainly can't be easy. Trying to pull it off without hospitality training, nearly impossible. Didn't get a chance to try the food but waited for over a half hour just for salad. It was actually cooking under a heat lamp when I went looking for my server to pay for my beers. All I wanted was a salad and the wings. They had 3 tables occupied. This place needs a plan."}
{"text":"Husband picked up dinner tonight and surprised me with Karsons. Food tastes great but no cornbread came with my meal,  so...m slightly disappointed but otherwise great meal."}
{"text":"So this is my first time stopping in. Good food as well as some amazing hours. Home cooked food available late night all week long. Somewhat full bar not just beer and wine they do have liquor as well. The parking kinda sucks but that's not the restaurants fault, it's inside the Ramada hotel. However it is only a few blocks from the central and Osborn light rail station."}
{"text":"Ordered a burger at 930pm and got it at 1015 pm the staff is not attentive or assertive to alert the kitchen of the the orders. Needs major improvement from the the top of the chain down. Fix this and it would will produce more more revenue. Make and effort to bring in a crowd."}
{"text":"I attended the grand opening of this spot and was pleasantly surprised!!! I can see where the wait times could be lengthy but I guess we arrived at just the right time (8-ish). Most places have horrendous wait times that time of the night. We waited less than 10-minutes to be seated. Our server was friendly and it really didn't take long to have our orders served. The food was delicious and the portions were adequate. I would recommend this as a good spot to hit up if you are desirous for some soul food."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. We tried to support this Black owned business but it was not up to par. The food is under seasoned (point of soul food is to have soul & season) and the cornbread was hard and cold. I had the catfish and chicken with rice and gravy & fries. Both the chicken and catfish was bland and the rice was gummy. From the onset we asked for a sample of the mac & cheese and the noodles were over cooked(gummy) and also bland. I asked the waiter about the potato salad and she said it was no good (no support from servers). Overall it was just not great! I understand why the other reviewer said the food taste like burnt turd!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Waitresses are always nice and the food is great. Plus is right around the corner for my day job. My wife and I lunch here every Friday. I would recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"We were thinking that we were going to a good chicken place 'not' took he food forever got us to get our meals, took 30 minutes for the chicken breast to get done, all of the meals were very soon coming out.  The chicken breast dinner finally came out should have been free no could only give a percent off so we didn't take it not good customer service.  Will not come back again."}
{"text":"Service was awful. Food is terrible. Being from the South, this is NOT soul food. I hate leaving bad reviews, but anyone thinking of trying this place... be warned."}
{"text":"Mediterranean burger tastes like a burnt turd. How is this soul food? You burnt it so bad that the soul of this cow vacated the meat. Fries are obviously pre-frozen packaged potatoes brought in from the cheapest wholesaler possible. Have you eaten any of your own food and not ended up with dysentery? Just a simple yes might warrant a second star. I'll leave the entire meal in my hotel fridge for the next guest. Disgusting."}
{"text":"We stop there after the events in downtown Phoenix. This is our regular hangout after plays.  Terrific food and the owner is a jewel."}
{"text":"Karson Kornbread is a great restaurant!! The food was Hot and fresh! Customer service was on point.. If you are looking for a place that makes you feel like you're at home, this is the place to be!"}
{"text":"I tried Karson 's Kornbread with my family this afternoon.   Poor service from the start from our waitress (who never told us her name).  We found out her name was Neasha from the bill.  We had to ask for silverware.  We were given cornbread muffins to snack on which were thick and tasteless.  Not at all what we were expecting.   We ordered 2 orders of wings, waffles and eggs, 1 side order of a waffle and a fish lunch.  My daughter's  chicken and waffles were cold and I had to wait on my waffle.  The food was very disappointing although it looks very good.  Please train your wait staff to have excellent customer service.   Karon's  had a good atmosphere just poor customer service and cold bland food.

{"text":"During a recent trip to Phoenix I had lunch at a fairly new soul food place.  For long time Phoenix residents you may recall the location as the old Boojum Tree lounge (3rd Ave & Osborne).  I had light lunch of a catfish filet with candied yams both of which were well seasoned.  Service was good on this day. The owner stopped by to chat and mentioned that the place just opened in January.  If you're in the area and have a taste for a new source of soul food, give Karson's Kornbread a try."}
{"text":"Came on a Friday night at 12am when they were supposed to close at 2am. Was told they were closing up and no dishes were available so we would have to eat out of to-go containers. 

Not a deal breaker so we stayed for dinner. Finally our waiter who was busy singing his favorite sexual R&B tunes got us a menu. So we ordered chicken and waffles of course. 

Cornbread came out first, dry and tasteless, butter did not help. 

Chicken came out and was not bad, after a while they noticed they forgot the waffles and brought them out. The were thin and hard and we did not finish them. 

After waiting around for the waiter to return from the back chatting up the female staff, we promptly paid and left. 

Wish the place was more inviting, staff were better trained and food was top notch. The location is prime for a great late night chicken joint. When I found it I thought we hit the gold mine, but I see now why I never heard of it before."}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to visit Karson's during a lunch break and I'm so happy I made that decision. The service was quick and efficient. The staff was pleasant and professional and the food was delicious! I will definitely be coming again. Parking is a little tight because they share it with the hotel but there is a parking garage behind the building a quick walk from the restaurant."}
{"text":"After all the good reviews I was really looking forward to lunch at Karson's. I wish our experience had rivaled others but it definitely did not.  We arrived at lunch time on a Saturday afternoon and were the only customers there. We were seated right away by the owner (?) and looked over the menu.  We ordered a fried chicken lunch, hush puppies and a BLT with a salad.  I didn't expect it to be speedy--good Southern food shouldn't be!--but it took 45 minutes for the chicken to arrive and my sandwich never came. The waitress said it had been overlooked (again, we're the only customers there) and would be made right away. Someone else (a manager maybe?) came over to apologize and assured me our meal would be discounted.  She specifically said to the waitress \"let me know when their bill is open; I need to put in the discount.\" The owner then came over and made his appropriate apologies for the error and offered a side/dessert.  He was very friendly and accomodating.  When the bill arrived, everything appeared to be full price with no discount but I had only a moment to look over it because the waitress was literally hovering over me with her hand out trying to take my credit card.  When I got it back (I know, I should have clarified everything first) I asked her to point out the discount, as \"everything here appears to be at full menu prices\". Her only response was \"it's on there. She had to ring it in separate\" after which she just quickly walked away without another word. No explanation, no answer, no resolution.  At that point we were so irritated we just left although I'm confident that had I showed the bill to the owner or the manager they would have made good on their word.  All in all, I'm usually pretty lenient when it comes to honest mistakes--I mean, not one of us is perfect.  But this was just too much.  I doubt we'll come back."}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday night with my mansss. We were nicely greeted by the owner and seated asap. We came later in the evening and it was great timing because we had the whole dining section to ourselves! We both ordered the chicken plate with Mac n cheese, mashed potatoes and cornbread, BOMB!!! The chicken was fried to perfection and I loved the juicy meat; I got the jalapeño cornbread and I'm so glad I did, I had to get another order. Everything was fresh and our service was great, our server Jeremy made us feel welcomed and he was quick and friendly- thank you kindly Jeremy. Also the owner was super cool, very easy-going and ever makes Jerk Chicken which I want to try asap. Definitely coming back, I want some more cornbread already"}
{"text":"I was staying at the Ramada and was pleasantly surprised to see a place that wasn't a typical hotel restaurant. I ate her two nights in a row and both the food and service were incredible. The fried chicken was nothing like I'd had anywhere else. If you're in the area you have to check this place out. 

Plus: they also have an old school R&B station playing all day. Perfect vibe for the place."}
{"text":"The lunch meal was enjoyable. I will try them again I didn't have a lot of time and the meal took a little longer then I expect however this wasn't a bad thing the food was serves HOT and cooked fresh!"}
{"text":"First of all I was so excited to go try a new restaurant I absolutely love food. But this by far was one of the worst experiences ever. There was this tall bald dude passing out samples and he reeked of Marijuana's and they claim he's the owner on top of that my sides were half cold half warm which tells me they are microwaving them. Disgusting! As well as false advertisement as I was informed by my waitress everything was made in house and fresh that clearly wasn't true the greens were chewy the cornbread was hard moral of story it's a trash restaurant and my family will not be going back McDonald's had better service"}
{"text":"The food is just not good. They should put more effort into perfecting their recipes. The cornbread was VERY dry and flavorless. The burger wasn't great. The chicken was plain. Our entire table agreed. I feel bad because I wanted to like it. This place reminds me of  cafeteria food in a hospital."}
{"text":"Excited for some soul food options in our neighborhood but our first visit was not ideal. There was no one to greet us when we walked in so we were a bit confused where to go. A waitress spotted us and told us to sit where we like. The reviews mentioned full bar but when we asked for a brunchy beverage we were told that there was not a bartender (10am on a Saturday in Central Phoenix during brunch!!). She did advise us a staff member would make us something if it was simple, we ordered a Karsons cooler, which was supposed to be raspberry and vodka, not sure what I got but it tasted like watered down pink lemonade. My husband got a screwdriver and the Oj was not very good, neither drink was strong. We were advised a chicken breast would take 25 minutes to cook so my husband opted for wings and waffles and I ordered chicken strips with fries and corn bread. I was told that the corn bread is made in the morning and wouldn't be ready for over 20 minutes (10am on Saturday....). Food came out about 20 minutes later, first the waffle, which was very thin and heavy. My husband was asked if he wanted cheese on his eggs, of course he said yes, was charged $0.75 later and not advised. The wings were crispy but did not have any meat on the bone. I had to ask three or four times for ranch with my chicken strips, then asked 10 minutes later for my corn bread that never showed up. We were told that would be another 20 minutes. My chicken strips were actually juicy and all white meat and the fries had awesome seasoning. Service continued to be slow and we finally received or cornbread with the check to take to go and still haven't tried it. My husband left hungry and it felt like we had spent most of the morning there. I would like to give it another shot because it is so close and showed some potential but this was not a great first experience."}
{"text":"I would like to say that the restaurant is beautiful and in a great location! The staff is extremely friendly and went out of the way to accommodate my family. Everything is cooked to order and we were more than happy with all of the food we tried. I realize it is a new establishment but I see great things in store for Karson's Kornbread."}
{"text":"I read about Karson's on Facebook and decided I would go for a drink, and dinner with cornbread. The FB ad mentioned drink specials, but none were offered.

When I arrived this Saturday night around 8:30, the place was empty with the exception of a couple who was sitting at the bar not eating or drinking.

I joined them at the bar, which seats only about five people. The restaurant is quite large, however.

I ordered my obligatory peach martini. The \"bartender\" had never made one before. As she was preparing my drink, she shared with the other patrons that she only knew the ingredients to a few drinks. Nevertheless, the drink was ok. Unfortunately, she served it on extra ice in a water glass. There was hardly any drink (just a few sips) and no garnish. She zapped all of the fun out of my drink ritual.

Anyway, I ordered fish & chips, but was told that I could not order it. I could only order the fish dinner with two sides. Mind you, one of the available side items is French fries, so I'm not sure why I couldn't have what I wanted.

The cornbread arrived. I was psyched, surely it was goingto be delish, hence the name of the restaurant...nope. Not good at all. Didn't at all taste like the cornbread I'm used to. It didn't seem fresh, nor was it hot.

My fish and two sides arrived. I was quite pleased with the meal. The fish was fresh, breaded perfectly and fried just right. There was plenty of food, enough for two, so I took half home. I also had collard greens and macaroni and cheese, both were really flavorful. 

The staff weren't very professional in their conversation. The bartender was accommodating however, so I just ignored the other chatter.

For it to be Saturday night, I expected a little more of a lively atmosphere. I would have been bored crazy were it not for the couple, who talked with me pretty much the entire time. There was no music. The televisions were on, but the volume was turned down.

However, the restaurant is beautifully decorated,the prices are inexpensive; and it's close to home.

I'll carry out next time."}
{"text":"Best greens! Ate them ALL! Fried chicken was like my grampa's and that is saying something.  It was fried fresh after I ordered.  Perfection.  Eilleene recommended the mashed potatoes and gravy.  I was not disappointed.  The gravy is homestyle with bits of chicken.  Delicious.  They gave me a to-go iced tea and boxed up what I could not finish. I will be back.  Happy tummy."}
{"text":"After reading a favorable Phoenix New Times review of this restaurant my husband and decided to go last night. I love cornbread. I figured that a restaurant with that word in its name must have really good cornbread. I was wrong. A plate of cornbread comes with your meal - we chose the jalapeno variety. We received a plate with 2 small, very dry corn muffins - each with 1 or 2 green flecks of, I guess, jalapeno. The meal itself? Fantastic! I got the catfish dinner - beautiful, delicate, well seasoned, crispy fried catfish - perfection. The greens and the hushpuppies were also top notch. Then we get to dessert - peach cobbler, which is supposedly the restaurant's top seller. What arrived at our table was a bowl of cinnamon broth with peach slices and cobbler crust floating in it - had to be eaten with a spoon. As we waited for our check another server came out and told us how good the cobbler is with a scoop of vanilla ice cream - if only we had known that was an option ...... I think this restaurant does a lot of things really well - my husband's chicken dinner along with the side of creamy mac were out of this world, but if your name suggests you are all about the cornbread, the cornbread had better taste like home made and not like something off a cheap continental breakfast buffet."}
{"text":"I ordered the fish dinner with mac n cheese and greens. GENUINE service. Iesha had great service and did what was necessary to make us feel comfortable. I WILL be back
FTC!"}
