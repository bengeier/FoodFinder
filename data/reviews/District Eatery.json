{"text":"The service is excellent, but the food and drinks are even better.  The attentive staff and unique atmosphere make for a very fun and comfortable experience.  

The naan nachos are delicious.  King St sling has a very refreshing taste and their old fashioned is spot on.

Definitely the place to be for great drinks and amazing food."}
{"text":"Delish! I am a gluten-free vegetarian, so it's usually slim pickin's at restaurants, but thanks to the fantastic labeling on the menu to know what's safe, I ordered the sweet corn appetizer and the District quinoa bowl. Both exceeded expectations! The cocktails we ordered were pretty fantastic, too! The rooftop patio was lovely, but the music had a few too many f-bombs and n-words for a public space. It was a warm day, and I had to ask to get the tiny water glass refilled. Leaving the carafe on the table would have been a better idea. Still, I'd go back!"}
{"text":"I had a great night here for a friends birthday. Dinner on the patio was delicious. We had plans to move on to another bar but decided to stay and try some cocktails and had an amazing time in the bar downstairs. The DJ was great too. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Food was bad, service was mediocre, my drink was a glass half full and overpriced. Food was plain and had no taste and was really terrible."}
{"text":"We checked out this new spot before seeing a film at TIFF and were very pleased! Well priced drinks, fun music, great menu with healthy gluten free, vegan and vegetarian options! Loved the wine by the ounce and cocktail menu. Service was a bit slow because they just opened up but we were prepared for that! Staff are very friendly and accommodating. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Came here with my girlfriend last Friday evening. We ordered the naan nachos, zen bowl and burbon chicken. Food was delicious and pretty quick. Our waitress Jasmine was extremely knowledgeable when describing the cocktails. We ended up trying their old fashioned, margarita , and king sling drinks all which were excellent and well crafted. The patio was busy however the ambiance up there was cool and felt relaxed. Can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"This was a nice find on a busy Toronto street. I had the tempeh bowl and it was generous, tasty and bursting with veggies. My friend had the chicken burger and was very satisfied with it. Definitely worth going."}
{"text":"Cool decor, nice patio! (Full of flies though)

Sloooow service while the place was empty.

Didn't get any cutlery or napkins.

The food itself was .... ok...   blackberry grilled cheese and chicken waldolf.

The fries were very underdone and the portion was small. 

It's a new spot so ya gotta put it down to teething problems but big improvement needed."}
{"text":"Though the menu appears to be creative, it's fairly bland and each item will set you back approximately $16. I get it, it's King Street. You could however, have the most amazing meal but everything else this place throws at you makes that meaningless. You'll arrive inside and likely wait a while unless you go in to find someone to ask if a table is available. You'll give them a quick pass because you have respect, but then you'll be met by a rude/lifeless employee who'll put you on a waitlist but as you wait in the bar area, it'll be up to you again to find someone to ask if the table is ready. Later on, your date is fairly frustrated by this point, and upon choosing food you'll be told certain menu items are \"unavailable/sold out\", but then you'll see another table get it 30 minutes later. It's a shame this is the new standard for many new restaurants in Toronto."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and music selection! Very cool cocktails as well, definitely going back"}
{"text":"This place is rad!

Amazing atmosphere with neon lights and not too loud for a bar!

I am vegetarian and heard through the grapevine about the amazing healthy \"bar-food\" options.

Had the district bowl and naan bread nachos and man was i impressed. I had 3 Moscow mules cause they were also just so damn delicious as well. We sat on the rooftop patio and were seated and greeted right of the get go by our friendly server. 
Overall great place."}
{"text":"I loved this place! I came here as part of a large group and we had to wait over 1 hour for others to slowly arrive. The staff were all very patient and never rushed us. They gave us time to think about what to order and regularly checked-in to see if we were ready. 

The interior design is comfortable and the atmosphere is very light and relaxing! Delicious and healthy foods! However, the prices are overpriced."}
{"text":"This place is new. It just opened a week or so ago. We sat on their rooftop patio! The cocktails were great. I tried the rhubarb and fennel drink and the Moscow mule. We didn't have enough time to stay and try their beer menu but it looked like a good selection. We ordered the hummus app and I had the district bowl and both were good. They have a few kinks to work out since they are new. Service was slow and they seemed a bit disorganized, but staff were very friendly!  Will come back again to give it another try!"}
{"text":"Terrible experience . Was served a margarita that looked like someone already drank half of it ! I thought there might be a mistake so I showed the server , asking if that was how the drink was supposed to be served.  She said yes , and that they are all measured out and the giant ice cube was a special size ice cube ( ..... uhhh. Okay  . ) I took the ice cube out to show the cocktail itself was about 1.5 oz without it . She nodded and tried to explain with an analogy about martinis .... ( I am a bartender myself so at this point I was frustrated .)  I said I would just have a cider . She left the drink.  

Then the manager came and basically says the same thing.  If this is how they make their drinks it's a SAD Excuse of a bar. A margarita is a beverage , NOT  a shooter  . 
The fact that they argued with me made it worse ."}
{"text":"Just opened up and they have a roof top patio.. hell yes! Drop by with the boyfriend on a Saturday afternoon and it wasn't as packed as the other patios. Maybe because it was new and people would rather have some wings and beer at Gabby's. 

They feature house cocktails and healthy food. Wasn't really a huge fan of their food choices so we had a drink and left. I enjoyed a spicy caesar and the boyfriend enjoyed an IPA. The energy was great. Patio was new and spacious. Would definitely drop by for drinks in the summer.

Happy Belly!"}
{"text":"Went in here last week on a rainy Friday after seeing a blogTo post. This place looked nice and since three of us were vegetarian we decided to try this place.

We decided to order shareables before ordering main dishes and decided  naan nachos and the grilled tempeh to start.We waited for 25 mins even though the restaurant was empty and all they had to do was melt some cheese on ready baked naan.

We got the naan nachos and they were slightly cold. It was 8 pieces those bagged mini naans you can buy from no frills for 2 bucks topped with some shredded cheese and they threw a tiny of bit of greens on it. That's it. There was absolutely nothing special about this dish. I believe it was around 12 dollars for that garbage. 

We ordered two orders of grilled tempeh. Even though the restaurant was not that busy, the dishes came to us cold so we sent it back. It came back burnt. The dish was again nothing special. It was literally tempeh you can buy from any grocery store for 3 dollars and they just brushed some bbq sauce on it. Big deal. Each dish was listed around 12 dollars too. We sent them back a second time and asked them to remove it from the bill.

Honestly, the dishes were just straight up embarrassing for a restaurant. What a joke.

We decided to leave. Most of the dishes are not even vegetarian and the shareable portions were tiny. There are so many vegetarian or vegan places in Toronto that are amazing. This place looks nice but the food was terribly disappointing."}
{"text":"I have come here twice now and the first time I came I won't lie, I did have a very bad experience. However, one bad experience can happen anywhere and it's about how the restaurant handles the situation. District Eater handled it very well hence my pleasant second visit.

This place has a fantastic drink menu. We both got the same drink, and then we got it again because it tasted so good! It was a chili tequila drink that had the perfect amount of spice and sweetness. There a bunch of other drinks on the menu that we want to try again.

As for the food, both of our meals came out quickly. We split the parmesan fries which were tasty. I had the chicken avocado sandwich which was really good! It's a little plain in terms of the flavour but the portion size was large so I took the rest for lunch the next day :)"}
{"text":"Came here twice for drinks. The patio at the back i have yet to see so it has always turned from wanting to try out the food to just a quick drink.

Beer is flat as hell and the old fashioned I asked for was rubbish so for now two stars. One for the nice venue the other for the polite waitresses."}
{"text":"3 for good patio and drinks/ drink specials. 
Food is a 0.
I'd heard they had a lot of vegan options so my friends and I were excited to try it out. I'd been for drinks and really liked it.
Well woof. I had the veggie quesadilla. It was canned refried beans spread on a tortilla with unmelted daiya cheddar. Not a vegetable in sight. I'm not sure what they heated it with, but it wasn't a pan. On the side was congealed mango salsa (a hundred percent packaged) and this gross coconut avocado dip that could have easily just been fresh guacamole. 
My friend had the curry quinoa bowl that looked both over and under cooked. Dry quinoa with transluscnet mushy veg in a bland sauce. I didn't try the veg burger but it looked okay.
All in all, tasted like reheated packaged items. 

Would go back for drinks. Nice atmosphere, good service, and great cocktail menu. I'll eat a snack on the way over. 
This is a case of location location location."}
{"text":"I went to eat at this place for an anniversary dinner. The drinks were good, unfortunately the food was terrible. The 1/2 chicken came out bloody and raw, the server tried telling us that's how their chicken is and it was cooked to temperature. However, this was not the case and the chicken was clearly uncooked and bleeding. The server and her manager did not seem to be very apologetic about this mistake and did not want to believe the chicken came out uncooked/bleeding. Even the side order of Parmesan and pepper fries, had unmelted cheese on them and did not taste good. For you information, don't get that chicken or avoid this place all together to not get disappointed!"}
{"text":"We joined a group of friends for dinner, so the place has great atmospheres and potential. The down fall was the food quality and service.  we were served fries in a rusty pan- which can be toxic depending on the cleanliness of the item. A Group of 6 or more, gratuities is included, but the waitress don't communicate that to the guests. Tips should be earned and 18% shouldn't be mandatory."}
{"text":"District eatery is a very unique cocktail bar on king west. It is unique because they cater to vegetarians and vegans, as most of their items are vegan/vegetarian friendly. They do not have beer pitchers either aka a cocktail bar. I got the bowl of zen which was very flavourful, filled with sesame sauce, ahi tuna and other greens and vegetables. Highly recommended and gluten free.


We sat on their new outdoor rooftop patio too, which had a very cute atmosphere and tucked away from the noisy Main Street"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were looking for a place to eat on King. Funny enough, this restaurant was recommended to us by a hostess from another restaurant a few doors down. We thought hey, if a hostess from another restaurant suggested this place it must be good right? Well, thank god she did because District did not disappoint!

We ordered the Avocado Wonton to start which was absolutely INCREDIBLE. It literally tasted like fresh guac stuffed inside a wonton and then deep fried and served with a side of cilantro crema - ummm yum!

We also shared the Smoked Fish Charcuterie which was delicious but my absolute favourite was the AAA Flat Iron Steak. This was probably one of the BEST steaks I've ever had in my life! If I had to compare, it would be as close to Ruth's Chris. Except it was $16 and not $60. Talk about a steal. 

I'm absolutely in love with this place. I appreciate that everything about District is visually pleasing - from the ambiance/décor of the restaurant, to their super classy menu all the way down to their patios and bathrooms. Yes, even their bathrooms are super cute! 
I also love that they have vegetarian, vegan and gluten free options! And that they make their own craft sodas which are made from 100% natural ingredients.  

Overall, I would definitely go back and highly recommend."}
{"text":"The signage caught my attention. I've ordered the Smoked fish Charcuterie, only ate two slices and I didn't finish. It was way to sweet to my liking. Just didn't taste good at all.

The drink -Moscow Mule was not bad. I feel the patio upstairs was a little crowded. Not sure if I will come back."}
{"text":"With such a promising menu, my dinner at District fell far short of expectations.  As a health conscious eater, I was excited to try District as the menu offered many healthy yet interesting choices.  The service was abysmal and the food could have been better.

Upon sitting down, it took the server a while to greet us and provide information about the restaurant after we noted that it was all of our first time.  After ordering drinks, I was surprised that I had to separately ask for water to be brought to the table.  After about 20 minutes, we were surprised that none of our food had been brought out (note that it is sharing style and we ordered several small appetizers and mains to share).  About 25 minutes later all 8 things we ordered came to the table ... which is not exactly how we pictured the dining experience.  The table was hardly big enough to fit all the food.  Especially since the menu was broken up into appetizers, sides, mains, etc. I did not think we had to specify that our preference was for the food to be brought in stages.  The food was fine ... nothing special.  When it was brought to the table, it was just dropped in the middle without any explanation.  We had trouble remembering which dish was which.  The dining experience felt so rushed with all food being brought out so fast.

No one came to fill up our water glasses or make sure we did not need anything else.  When we were done eating, no one came to clear dishes for a long time.  When the waitress finally returned to our table, I explained that we felt the service was poor and that it was frustrating that all the food was brought out at once.  There was no offer to do anything or any sincere apology.  The manager then came to our table and argued that since we mentioned the items would be shared that they figured we would want to eat them all at once.  Still no offer to do anything.  I asked if anything could be done at which point they offered to take off 2 appetizers from the bill.  Sad that I had to beg for something to be done when the service was objectively poor.

As they brought the bill, the dessert menu came and it looked fabulous so too bad the service was so disappointing."}
{"text":"My friend and I shared the Smoke Fish Charcuterie, Blackerry Grilled Cheese and District Bowl. The Charcuterie was by far the best dish of the three. The smoke meat flavour was on point.

Blackberry Grilled Cheese was interesting combination of jam, cheese, and lots of crispy bacon. Not sure if I would order it again though. District bowl is also so-so, a healthy veggie dish but not much special."}
{"text":"This place is highly underrated. I had drinks and a vegan burger and they were both amazing. The quality and taste matched my expectations, not to mention the amazing variety for vegetarians and vegans. I love this place and will definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Food was decent, service was friendly. However, prices were hefty considering the quality of the food. One of the sandwiches was about $14 (and this is just the sandwich, and does not include side orders)."}
{"text":"High expectations met with sad food. We ordered the grilled tempeh, jalapeno bites, and the district bowl. The establishment did not look too busy but the dishes took quite a while to come in. Texture, temperature of the food, price, and all around quality was not up to par with my expectations (or blog review I read about this new restaurant).

Food was cold. I could have made much better (creative and tasty) food at home. District Eatery is not worth a repeat visit, or better yet, avoid it.

We waited for the bill just as long as we did for the food. 

Note: The restaurant is extremely loud, and dark (unlike their super bright street sign)."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place so much but everything I tried made me want to run away. 

A friend and I came here for dinner on a Thursday night, the place was busy but not packed. It first took us forever to get a seat, the hostesses kept walking pass by us and never bothered to sit us despite the few empty tables inside. When we finally managed to get here attention, we asked for the patio but the curtly replied that we'll have to wait forever.

We ordered a few plates to share mainly based off the waitresses recommendations, we got the naan bread nachos, the jalapeño, the parmesan fries and the cauliflower. She also recommended the king St sling and the moscow mule as drinks. 

The naan bread nachos were not bad but nothing too standout, just your typical cheese with a few toppings. The cauliflower in a skillet were mushy and oily, the parmesan fries had NO parmesan and NO black pepper and tasted like NOTHING but potato... The jalapeño dish was the worst and came with a total of three HALVES of jalapeños, not even three full ones, with a dollop of cheese in each and looked like people had attempted to wrap them in bacon but failed... Drinks were also very meh and not worth the high price tag."}
{"text":"Amazing service! Many different health conscious options to chose from. All of the food is incredible as well as the cocktails.  Five stars for sure!"}
{"text":"Group of three and we were seated on the first level by the windows. Waited 15 min for any service. There was one waitress flirting with the guys at the table next to us. We decided to go somewhere else instead of waste more time."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday around 6 p.m. I was alone so I headed to the bar section the whole venue was very simple loved the decor the bar area had a foosball table they played R&B in the background current and classic

I ordered the zinfandel Rose and the mango avocado chickpeas wrap I did not realize that when chickpeas is baked that it is crunchy so be aware of that

Other than the crunchiness of the chickpeas the wrap was delicious the flavors Blended together very well and was very flavorful and filling I would definitely recommend this place if you're in the area but I don't think it's a destination please to drive to if you live far

None of the cocktails stood out to me which is why I ended up ordering a wine the combinations just didn't seem appetizing I took a picture of some of the menu and you can see what I mean"}
{"text":"The ambiance (roof top patio) is pretty nice - especially on a beautiful day outside!

Located on King W, this place is always busy.  Lucky that we snagged a rooftop table.  We didn't order food - just drinks.  I had a spicy something or other and it was the blandest spicy that I have ever tasted.  You could give a baby that spice level and they wouldn't even blink an eye.  It was also overpriced for the taste/size.

Now that I've experienced it I probably won't be rushing back, which is a shame since the rooftop vibe is kinda cool."}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday night to grab a drink with some friends. We ordered some snacks to share and some drinks.

This restaurant have a casual atmosphere. Looks like a decent spot to grab drinks with friends. The menu was also very interesting. There are many healthy options and many vegetarian options. 

Service: The service was horrible. When we asked for water, the waiter looked at us and turned around to leave without saying anything. It looked like she wasn't happy because we asked for water after receiving our wine. It was probably getting late and she was tired...and she felt we didn't need water because we have some liquid already which was our wine? Honestly, I don't know but she did not look happy. 

Food/drinks: Everything was okay. Nothing stood out. The restaurant may be a great choice for those looking for healthy or vegetarian options. But in terms of taste, it was okay. 

Will I return? Maybe I will give it another chance but I do hope they hire more friendly waiters."}
{"text":"I loved this place! I was here on a Friday night with a couple of friends. As it was a small group we ordered a bunch of plates for sharing. My favourites were nachos, chicken salad with apples and of course cheese fries! The nachos were not like nachos you're used to see, but more like mini pizzas with lots of toppings. It was delicious!
The drinks were good too(Caesar wasn't great though), especially the $1 per ounce house wine. We got a lovely waitress as well, she was pretty quick with our orders.
I would definitely recommend this place for small groups and all kind of gatherings."}
{"text":"Lots of gutten free options ! The vibe is pretty nice, sort of hippy, Good tasting food at a decent price in king west area."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere on the rooftop patio but unfortunately the food is very overpriced for what it is. Sandwiches are 13-14$ and do not even come with a side. Cocktails are 8-14$ and are quite good, but definitely on the expensive side.
Food took a while considering we all ordered sandwiches. Good thing we ordered drinks as well to pass the time.
My waiter brought out the wrong drink due to a miscommunication. She tried to get me to keep it and even asked people at the table if they were going to order it so she didn't have to bring it back. When she brought the new drink I definitely didn't taste any alcohol in there. 
If I wanted to spend this much on food, I would actually go to a nicer restaurant."}
{"text":"Was here on a Sunday around 630 in September on a beautiful and warm evening. We had no problem sitting on the patio. We had made a reservation thinking that it might be very busy. The inside was pretty much empty. I was very surprised by this. Our waitress was very nice and the meal I ordered was really good. I like that they had a lot of gluten-free, vegan, and vegetarian options. The cocktail I ordered sounded really cool, but the flavours that had been described I couldn't taste them. The Decour was pretty fun and happy. The washrooms had a selfie mirror and fun wallpaper. I was slightly disappointed the Instagram account made it look a little bit different and more upscale. The location also is a bit awkward being in the entertainment area it's not really on the part of king where a lot of young people would be."}
{"text":"Recently came a couple weeks ago, attracted by the ambiance and crowds. The space itself is really nicely decorated, with interesting pieces to stare at, great lighting and comfortable seating. The service was friendly and efficient, but the food execution needed some more thought and work.

We both ordered a Sambora to begin the evening. It was light spritzer which wasn't that interesting, but it works for a hot summer night. The Nan Bread Nachos was something that I've never seen before, so naturally it was ordered. Basically it was a plate of little discs of soft bread drenched in sauce and sprinkled with greens. Even with the addition of chicken, it was kinda bland and needed more texture to make it more interesting. Something crispy would have helped, especially with the thought of nachos in the name. The steak and mushroom had better flavor. Unfortunately the steak was tough and I encountered multiple bites I couldn't chew through. I expect better meat quality when it's advertised as AAA flat iron steak. This place just doesn't measure up to the other great choices in the area."}
{"text":"I liked the vegetarian options on the menu so I made a reservation for dinner after watching a tiff movie on a Sunday. Our movie ran late but they were still able to take us as it wasn't very busy.

The menu had many items that looked good and a decent amount of vegetarian options. We started with the avocado wontons, which sounded unique. It was actually very bland and one came hollow....they brought out a different one to replace the hollow one but it was kind of burnt.

My husband had the fish charcuterie tray which he did not enjoy very much. It's probably best as a shared item but since I don't eat meat/fish, he found it difficult to manage by himself. He said he got tired of the taste...and the fish was cold.

I ordered the district bowl which was vegan and gf. Sadly, this too was a cold item and very bland. As a vegetarian, I appreciate having options but I would prefer the food to be warm and way more flavourful"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved the cocktail program, well done Andrew!!! 
The foozball table, massive tv's and live music Thursday only added to the atmosphere!! 
I would recommend the bourbon bowl"}
{"text":"Nice place in walking distance of my hotel in center Toronto. Have vegan and non vegan dishes which is cool and very fresh food"}
{"text":"GET THE PULL APART CAULIFLOWER with cheese and bacon. It is SO.GOOD. It took forever to get and the drinks were weak but man it was good. They are under staffed for the amount of space they have. Good selfie mirror in the ladies bathroom however it smells like an old wet basement. But if you drink enough weak drinks, you won't care about that."}
{"text":"Some friends and I went in here on a Friday night for some drinks and we absolutely loved it. The atmosphere was super chill and our server was very nice and friendly. The cocktails are super tasty and they have a unique beer selection. There was also a dj late in the night who was super dope."}
{"text":"Maybe growing pains?  The food was decent but typical for king west and the prices where also very mainstream.  
Service was deplorable. It took 30 minutes for a drink and then the bill came in 1 minute


I wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Having a new venue on King W appears exciting to try. 

We were seated in the front , it was not very busy for a Saturday nights.

The waitstaff appeared to be untrained or overwhelmed with tasks.

Took out drink orders and we ordered 2 apps jalepeno and avacado wonton.

They came out with decent time though the waitstaff took the menus away.

Food was prepared had very little flavour or effort, and 3 half jalepenos for 12 dollars is a joke .

We had to ask waitstaff for a menu again as she did not come to check up on us.

We ordered skirt steak , Brussels sprouts , district bowl.

Food took 25 minutes to get to table though I watched it sit on kitchen window for at least 10.

Even if the waitress was busy they had 2 mangers standing at food window that could of coordinated.

Food arrived like warm at best , flavour was was not great .

Very disappointed ..

Need to better train staff to multitask and have mangers check on patrons to ensure quality control.

One last tip is the kitchen is exposed to clients dining therefore should be hyper aware on sanitary practise."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday.  The drinks were amazing, and I was really excited when I saw the food menu! I got the vegan meatloaf and was super disappointed.  The mash potatoes were sweet, I think it might of been cauliflower with a little something in it, and the meatloaf was dry and brittle. They swapped me out for the curry cauilflower bowl which was much better, but still not great. There were only 2 servers for the whole establishment, so we didn't get checked up on for additional drinks, how our food was, and we had to flag down for service.  I would go again for the drinks."}
{"text":"At first, looking at the menu I was excited because its a place that has something for everyone, vegetarian and vegan too. Unfortunately the food wasn't great and the service wasn't good. However if you want to have a drink outside they have a rooftop patio"}
{"text":"Fit Toronto, where can you go and not have to burn that cheat meal? Boom, District Eatery is your place. It seemed to me there health conscious menu had one hit after another. My gal was so happy to see this menu, she even let out a, \"Finally! A menu not filled with garbage.\" She is getting in shape for the next amateur fitness figure show. So that says something. 

Do not get me wrong, I myself am just a regular guy. I still like burgers and greasy food. I'm telling you this place won't disappoint. All of the food being whole foods are filling and won't leave you underwelmed. 
Two thumbs up from us.

Omg, I almost forgot. Their bartender, making drinks up on the fly. Delish! A must go!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were hungry after a movie and decided to have a late dinner here since it was open pretty late. Menu was fairly interesting. We decided on the naan bread nachos, parmesan and pepper fries, and the District blackberry grilled cheese. The naan bread nachos were kind of strange. The naan was thick, which I didn't mind, but I don't think it went well with the toppings. The appetizer was overwhelming and we were only able to finish about half of it. The parmesan and pepper fries were okay. Thank goodness for the blackberry grilled cheese though, which was amazing. It was probably the best grilled cheese sandwich I had ever had. The melted, gooey cheese plus the bacon plus the blackberry jam made for a delicious sandwich. If you're at District, you've gotta try it!

{"text":"There is a facebook video going around advertising this place to have gluten-free & vegan bar eats. Not sure who made this video but it's totally not true lol. Yes, they have some vegan options like most restaurants in the city (i.e. salad, fries, veggie dishes) and I do appreciate that they have gf options and they they seem to be pretty allergy aware, but don't come here thinking it is a vegan bar. It definitely is not. 

The food was average and comparable to most pub/bar food (think firkin, shoeless joes, jack astors)... I got the roast potatoes which were really dry and a side salad which was just like any other salad. My friends who don't have dietary restrictions were able to each much funner stuff - the naan nachos, the tuna bowl, grilled cheese... they all said the food was good, but not amazing. Also, price is a bit high and portions are a bit small.

Our server was nice and was super accommodating to my restrictions. She was also a bit slow though. They also ran out of one of the desserts we ordered and it took them 45 minutes to let us know. Not a huge deal as we weren't in a rush but they can definitely work on the service aspect of the business. 

I would go back if invited but have no reason to suggest going back."}
{"text":"A wonderful variety of choices for vegan and meat enthusiasts  alike . Excellent service ."}
{"text":"Walked by this place and decided to go in. 
If you want to sit at the front you have to make reservation but near the back there is free seating. There's also a bar by the back for people to chill and have a drink. 

The menu is very diverse and filled with a lot of different flavours. We ordered the Bourbon Chicken Bowl, AAA Steak, Avocado Wonton, and Kimchi Quesadilla. The Avocado Wontons and Kimchi Quesadilla came to start and it was a pleasing appetizer. Super delicious and worth it, even though the wontons were a tad expensive. For the main course, I do recommend the Bourbon Chicken Bowl cause it was very tasteful and had variety of different veggies in it.The Steak was a little hard to cut through so not really a triple A Steak LOL. But it's all gucci because at that point I was already insanely full with deliciousness to let that negativity bother me. 

The District is super pretty and has a very chill vibe to it. The staff there is also super cool and our top of their responsibilities. I also love that they have vegetarian, vegan and gluten free options on their menu. Be sure to give this place a shot if you happen to be around because it will not disappoint."}
{"text":"This is more a 3 and a half, but honestly I really want to give this place the benefit of the doubt and just assumed I ordered the wrong thing. First - this place is beautiful! And right across from the Tiff as well - I can't believe I'd never been here before, as I'm always in this area. I had looked up the menu online before, which looked promising, and I was even more excited by the house wine being a dollar an ounce - as I should've been! It was super good, and a steal at it's price point as well! For my meal I ordered the Grilled Tempeh, and although it was fine, it tasted like any old tempeh I could've made myself. It was pretty bland, and the sauce they give you on the side was barely enough for my meal. The person I was with got the mango wrap and I ended up having a bite, and it was super good! Honestly I'd come back here, but I do hope that eventually they spice up all of their dishes equally."}
{"text":"This place has good ambience and location right across tiff bell box, would rate it 4/5 ambience wise.
      Their drink menu is good my favorite is the Serrano 6ix has Serrano chili that adds an extra kick to the drink. Overall this place good for one or two drinks and snacks not good option for lunch.
    Service wise our server was totally confused and forgot what we ordered. We would request something and remind her again and again then she would get us the things we requested. We ordered appetizers and 4 main course so we expected appetizers would come in first but turns out everything was served same time. So, make sure you let them know that you need appetizer first. Based service I would rate them 2/5
For food it not a good place 3/5 I am rating t 3 as food presentation is good 

Cauliflower curry bowl: It is good & healthier option but the dish was dry they should have added more gravy (coconut milk). The spice taste was very overpowering more curry powder and turmeric was added that resulted in this. But overall it is good dish I would rate it 3/5. I would recommend naan nachos or if you prefer meats their steaks dish is good. 

pesto zucchini pasta: There was no pesto in this dish so taste wise it was very bland. The dish looked good but had no taste: 2/5

Vegan Ice-cream: I was told they make it in house it was just frozen block of ice as you can see it in picture. It was block of ice crystal chai and passion fruit flavored so called vegan ice-cream that was for 8.5 cad. I should have told them to microwave this for 10 secs . Vegan ice-cream doesn't have any dairy and it forms ice crystals quickly the ice-cream they served me was not churned or not stored properly so it was big block of ice crystals like what you will get when you freeze your left-over breakfast smoothie.     Vegan ice-cream here is total waste of money so do not opt for that try cheesecake or chocolate torte instead."}

S'mores. Wine. 

I didn't come here for dinner, but I saw this at another table. The s'mores dessert might be more than just taste, it's an experience! You can smoke your own s'mores on the table! They bring out a mini fire pit that you can smoke your own marshmallows while you assemble the s'mores together. Pretty neat!

The other good thing about this restaurant is their house wines. It's $1 an oz all day long, both red and white! The wines aren't bad too, a Chardonnay or a Cabernet Merlot from Peller estates. So if you're about to catch a movie across the street at the light box, this might be a great place to have a drink first before heading over to your movie. 

We also ordered the avocado wonton. Taste was alright and wasn't that special. 

LAST TIP?!

There are a ton of options on their menu! They range in quite a bit of different variety so I'm sure your party will find something that will suit their individual palates. Some of the options, you won't even find elsewhere. Such as for cocktails, they have mulled wine and non alcoholic, they have kombucha, crafted sodas and power teas so I recommend yougo for the unique features for this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I've eaten up and down King Street. So I was exciting to see a new, healthy option. 
The bar has a really fun design, and I like the layout a lot. I've been to the back patio previously in the summer (and it's incredible on a sunny day!). 
The food is so yummy. Good variety. I recommend the zen bowl and the naan nachos (one healthy and one less-healthy lol) 
But I think the REAL winner here is the drinks. The mules, the spiked teas and the spicy margarita are so so good and a must try. 
Enjoy!!"}
