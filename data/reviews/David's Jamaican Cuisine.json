{"text":"This place rocked. Not a lot of options but it's probably best to go with what the server suggests. A!!!"}
{"text":"Love coming here for lunch buffet! It's been a while since we've been here but every time we come it's great! Sometimes I feel like the waitstaff does forget about you, especially with re-filling water.  There have been times when I had to drinking my fianc√©'s water, especially when some of their food have mild spices."}
{"text":"now this place was a godsend... i was really upset that i found this place just a few days before i left madison to come back to cali.  i found it by accident on my way to some random clinic to take a drug test, which i passed, by the way.    the jerk chicken served with some jamaican style cabbage and their f'in delicious rice and peas, rice and beans to those unfamiliar. i had to get the fried plantains on the side because that's how i roll and if you don't know about dem fried plantains, you better ask somebody... and because i was starving, i ordered two jamaican beef patties on the side.  back on jamrock the beef patties are served tucked into a big ass piece of coco bread.  unfortunately, they didn't have the coco bread here, but it was tasty nonetheless.   first day there the cashier had somewhat of an attitude.  i later learned that she was only friendly and polite to the white folks.  oh well, the food was fantabulous.  the next day i took my coworkers and we were fortunate enough to be served by another lady with that island love straight from jamrock.  i ordered the jerk salmon... lovely.   i recommend getting some extra jerk sauce to pour over your rice and peas and whatever entree you get.  also, don't forget the fried plantains!"}
{"text":"So good. Went for the lunch buffet. 9 bucks. Everything was amazing but the mango chicken, curry chicken, and jerk pulled pork were highlights. This place is a gem for anyone that wants authentic, amazing food at a ridiculous price. I want to try the dinner buffet next time im in town.  The ladies working there are also very nice. The decor isnt anything special but I hardly noticed. Great food, great price. Go in hungry and leave happy."}
{"text":"The food is excellent.  It has been some years since I've been to Davids, so I thought I'd give it another try. That being said, I was disappointed in the cleanliness of the restaurant, still.  It's filthy.  We sat down to a table that had not been cleaned in who knows how long.  And with a look at the floor, it has probably been much longer.  The service was sub-par as well.  We walked in, with no direction as to if we were to be seated, or seat ourselves, and when asked, it's as if we were a slight bother.  After we sat down, about 5 or 6 minutes later, the waitress took our drink order.  (5 or 6 minutes when there are only a couple people in the restaurant is unacceptable)  2 beers came nearly 10 minutes after the order.  I'll not go on about how disappointed I am with this place.  The food is so good.  But they could make it a hell of a nice place to dine, with just a little effort."}
{"text":"Yay! I finally got a chance to eat here this weekend, and I must say it was fantastic! We went for lunch (takeout) on a very cold day. I ordered the jerk chicken ($6.50) and he ordered the jerk pork ($6.95). We got two orders of plantains ($1.95 each). The decor was very..festive. It was all decked out in yellow and green. I'd really like to try their buffet as it seemed like it had all of the dinner entrees on it.  OK. Our styrofoam containers were stuffed with food! Our entrees came with a choice of two sides: veggies (a hot carrot/cabbage/broccoli slaw.. very tasty), rice 'n' peas (rice with red beans), or potato salad. We both got veggies, he got potato salad, and I got rice 'n' peas. The potato salad was okay.. it was standard mayo based potato salad. No zip. The rice 'n' peas were alright.. for some reason only my favorite place back home puts some coconut in the rice to cool down the jerk sauce. As far as the meats go, the chicken was great. It was deliciously flavored, moist, and falling off the bone. The sauce was really nice too.. very well balanced. They gave us extra in case we wanted a little more heat. I think they blend their own because there was a bottle with a picture of David on it at the cash register. There were two drumsticks and a small breast in the order. Boy's order of pork was very tender and flavored well again (almost like jamaican bbq, he said because it was pulled). The pork tasted and looked kind of like beef, though we don't recall seeing any jerk beef on the menu.. so maybe our taste buds were off... I love this place.. it is a great deal!"}
{"text":"Mmmmmmmmmm.  The buffet is awesome.  Delicious food and enough variety.  You must visit this lunchtime buffet.  Not much of a location, but cannot go wrong with the food.  Awesome value."}
{"text":"Best and most authentic Jamaican food in town (I lived in Jamaica for 5 years). No frills service and atmosphere. Try the plantains, veggie pie and ackee. Yum."}
{"text":"If you are ever over here at lunchtime, be sure to stop in. I am very enthusiastic about this place! I used to drive over here once or twice a week for the lunch buffet. Dinner and  weekends you order off the menu, but it is the same good food. Great Jamaican, Great buffet!  My favorite dish is the jumbalaya, though it isn't always at the buffet. Mango chicken and jerk pork are also great. There is always a good abundance of fried plantains. I highly recommend taking a lunch break to come out here--but be prepared to take a lot of lunch breaks over here after you try it."}
{"text":"Great food, atmosphere, and friendly staff! Just make sure you go for lunch so you can try everything from the menu on the lunch buffet. I love this restaurant, just wish they had more of the lunch buffet items available on the dinner menu."}
{"text":"Best Jamaican food I have ever had.  Then again, I have never been to Jamaica...however, I would expect it to taste like this. Very friendly family owned business.  Dave always has a smile on his face and is a pretty funny guy.  I haven't tried much of the menu but I've ate here many times.  I can't seem to venture from the jerk steak. Insane amount of food (2 to 3 full meals) and it's absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Madison. The food whether ordering off the menu or getting the lunch buffet is alway amazing.  Full of flavor and served with love and ((((HUGS))).  I have tried just about everything and have never had a bad meal.  The jerk chicken is my favorite followed by the mango chicken. Their jerk sauce is so good, I buy bottles of it and have it on everything from grilled meats and vegetables at home to my eggs in the morning.  The banana and coconut cakes are also delicious."}
{"text":"Best Jamaican food in the whole state!! And they're even FROM Jamaica! How's that for authenticity! It's a family run business and I got that sense of family by just eating there.  Unfortunately I moved from Madison and my tummy cries for their food all the time! Whenever I am in town though, I stop there --especially for their all you can eat buffet on Fridays. They get kinda nervous when I walk in because I eat all their food. I can't help it! It's all so tasty. They use the perfect amount of seasonings and their meat, like their chicken and ribs, is so succulent meat falls off the bone and melts in your mouth. Plus it doesn't have that \"chain restaurant\" type feeling. You go in there, you eat great food and they let you enjoy yourself.  When they first opened, I asked the owners why they didn't open up other locations because their food was so darn good. And they said they didn't want to get too big and compromise the food. That kind of dedication in what they do really spoke to me. It spoke to my belly too.  Pineapple Salmon--awesome! Jerk tofu--awesome! Meat patties--awwww yeeaahhh! You have GOT to try this place! Stop reading this and go now! Do it!!"}
{"text":"Great Jamaican Cuisine!  David and Pauline are the best. Jerk Chicken or Pork...you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"As much a I appreciate David et al bringing the taste of Jamaica from Montego Bay to Monona Drive, I gotta be honest- I really really love Jamaican food.  In Jamaica.    On the plus side- the banana cake is to die for- next time I will eat dessert first. The jerk chicken- very authentic- right down to the nearly unidentifiable pieces of chicken.  Peas and rice- quite nice.    Wait staff are very authentic as well- Pepsi from cans, no hurries- all of which are a 'taste of the island'.  Funny- it seems much more charming in Jamaica, where the only thing to do next is catch a sunset."}
{"text":"I have been a couple of times for dinner. Their curry chicken is good, served with btown rice. Plaintain fried are amazing. Friendly staff and nice place to hangout."}
{"text":"An unassuming location that was packed with people enjoying their food & conversations when we arrived late-ish on a Saturday night, David's was a pleasant dining experience.  The Jerk Pork was shredded & very flavorful. I could detect ginger, but couldn't figure out the spice mixture; I like flavors that keep my mouth guessing. The veggies (a cabbage, carrot, broccoli, bell pepper mix) were lightly cooked & also had some slight seasoning that really enhanced the taste without overshadowing the taste of the veggies themselves; I could have had an entire plate of the veg & been satisfied! Well, I wouldn't want to miss the meat, but the veggies were that good!  My husband had the goat curry & he really enjoyed that as well. I knew that he liked it because all of a sudden, he wasn't talking to me, he wasn't looking at me, he was just eating.   We both put down our forks when we were full, but kept taking bites here & there as we waited for boxes.  The service was a little slow after we got our food, but it didn't seem like neglect, it was busy & there just seems to be a small number of staff. But, they were super friendly & engaging, & this first visit will not be our last. I'm interested in trying the buffet to get a broader taste of their fine food!"}
{"text":"F I could've given them a negative star I would. As a African American I've never had another person of color be racist. Is was the most humiliating and embarrassing experience. The waitress never spoke to us; we stood for a while I finally asked do we seat ourselves she just pointed to a table. We sat. She said u eat buffet. I was like no my husband had a heart transplant he can't. She rolled her eyes and tossed our silverware on the table. I made a plate but wanted some jerk sAuce to put on my rice and chicken (all the food was cold on buffet) she followed me to buffet nudged me over like she wanted to stir veg then told me I had to get a new plate to go up to the buffet. Meanwhile I hadn't even eaten the one I had. There was a lady who had been there before me and had been up there with the same plate several times ;and a few more customers(Caucasian ) she was very customer service and nice. So I said u need to have a sign up f that's the rules. She goes to the previous lady talking about how stupid I was for not knowing to get a new plate. From that point on continued being rude and argumentative and I had to ask her several times to give my husband his change from paying for food and when she did gave him to much I gave her the extra money and walked away. What kinda Jamaican spot don't have beef patty and u just opened up. I've never heard of such. She wouldn't even give us lemon. And the food had good flavor but was at least day old food."}
{"text":"For the price, I really can't complain too much!  I met mom here for their lunch buffet.  I tried a little bit of almost everything.  The jerk pork is melt in your mouth good, especially with a little extra jerk sauce on it.  The catfish was flaky and tender.  The plantains were fresh and sweet.  Banana cake- on point!  Super moist and soft.  I also enjoyed the BBQ pork and the mango chicken was not bad as well.  I thought everything had a lot of flavor and there was extra jerk sauce on the table if you needed more.  It seemed like fresh food was constantly being made in the kitchen and coming out.  Service wasn't super attentive, but really, it's a buffet, so I don't need attentive service.  She cleared our plates when we were done with them and came around with a water pitcher.   Buffet price is $8.97 so if you're looking for a good, cheap lunch in Monona, look no further.  I don't know if I'll necessarily come back to try their dinner, but I did leave full and happy."}
{"text":"We ordered take out, jerk pork and jerk chicken. My mouth watered smelling it the drive home, took all my will power not to start eating it with my hands at the stoplight. My taste buds were not disappointed. The jerk pork is my favorite, it's so flavorful and smokey and amazing, the sides were great too, my husband loves the chicken, we will be back (again and again and again)"}
{"text":"Very good Jamaican cuisine with an affordable lunch buffet.  The jerk sauce table-side condiment is a must!"}
{"text":"Man every bite was bringing me closer to the islands. I have been looking for a little bit of heaven on earth and this place is it. The food was so fresh and good I am going to return with my whole crew from charter cable. This is it the fish was great breaded fish spice fish man look stop reading and start driving to this place.. TCG"}
{"text":"I Came because I wasnt gonna leave the Madison without some Jamaican food. Since Jamerica closed after lunch, yelp led me here. Before we get into the food and what not, the restaurant was fairy handicap friendly unlike the other place. They had the usual Jamaican drink fare such as Ting and Red Stripe. My wife is vegetarian and they didn't have the vegetable meat patty or the potato salad. I had a beef one. It was authentic but they should have a hot option as it wasnt even as hot as most restaurant's mild. I ordered jerk pork as I don't see it on most other Jamaican menus. The meat was delicious and well seasoned  the rice and beans are okay. The vegetables were crunchy, slightly spicy with a lil vinegar, unusual but not bad. The building was a hot old run down Mexican restaurant with Jamaican flag colors on the interior and the service won't get you writing home to your mom. But seriously, i will definitely be back to this lil gem."}
{"text":"This is the best food i ever had here in Madison and the portions are amazing, very nice place to go eat.."}
{"text":"This is some of the best food I have ever had. I have been a frequent visiter to Davids for several years and have rairly had a bad meal.   The building is old and a little run down....but thats part of the fun. You will feel like you have discovered a gem in a pile of Applebees and Olive Gardens."}
{"text":"My wife is Jamaican and she says this is absolutely authentic.  We've been going for 15 years and have no plans to stop.  I get the jerk steak every time so I'm pretty sure it's my favorite.  My wife is a bit more adventurous and gets something different each time.  The other reason we go, they treat everyone like family.  It's a down to earth relaxed atmosphere, like going to grandma and grandpa 's house.  If you're new to Jamaican food try the Friday night buffet.  I almost forgot, get a red stripe or D&G soda (Kola Champagne)."}
{"text":"Great Meal!  Had the Jerk Chicken and Ribs along with the Jerk Shrimp!    The red sauce they have was the bomb!!!     Totally going back to try the lunch buffet.... Cabbage is to die for."}
{"text":"Another great restaurant in Monona, I've heard that their lunch buffet is the better time to go. Outside of their buffet the prices are kind of iffy which is the only really reason I can't feel comfortable giving this 5 stars. The atmosphere is great the staff is really friendly feels very much like a family owned restaurant. The lady waiting on us asked if we'd ever been there before and we hadn't, she gave some recommendations and when I asked what Ting was she said okay I'll just put that on there you'll love it and I did. I felt good about eating there and it made me smile come here for one of those rainy days I need some cheering up from good food and good people."}
{"text":"Extremely rude service!  The food was eh.  Maybe we hit it on a bad night, but I'm not going back to find out."}
{"text":"Although it wasn't totally terrible, David's Jamaican Cuisine is not a restaurant to which I will return. A friend and I met for lunch at David's a few days ago -- he had previously eaten there and didn't love it, but agreed to go again because I wanted to try it after reading all the great reviews on Yelp and other review sites. When we arrived, I was surprised to see a lunch buffet set up. Previous experience with lunch buffets at other restaurants has caused me to interpret buffets as warning signs, but, since we were already there, we decided to stay.  We ordered sodas, which arrived in cans. Not a big deal, but worth mentioning because I know some people prefer to drink out of cups.  The lunch buffet had approximately 15 options ranging from jerk chicken and jerk pork to plantains to rice to mango chicken to pineapple slaw with tofu. The jerk chicken was good, though not as flavorful as I had expected or hoped, but the other foods I tried ranged from blah to bad.  Based on the outstanding reviews David's has received, I was very surprised and disappointed by my experience. I'm tempted to give this restaurant one more try, but really can't decide if it's worth the money and the drive to Monona."}
{"text":"I can only speak to the lunch buffet as I have yet to visit during the dinner hour, but this place is a great value. The lunch buffet offers a variety of food, all of which is good for an affordable price. The jerk pork and the mango chicken are my two favorite meat options, though they also offer jerk chicken, curry chicken, bbq pork among other options. I also really enjoy the breaded catfish. The banana cake is fantastic as desert and the fried plantains really balance out the flavors of the meal well. I'll have to go back for a dinner entree at some point, but all I can say for now is that if you're in Monona and you need lunch this is a great option."}
{"text":"Ordered: curried goat, plantains, and patty.   Goat was well cooked - tender. Curry was bland and lacked spice and punch. Can't really mess up the rice so no complaints. Plantains were a little soggy and lacked crisp. Patty was way more dough than filling, wasn't flaky, and over priced for what it was(n't).   Ambiance: chill, good space, comforting. Variety of different riddims playing was a nice backdrop.   Service: Jamaican - however u wanna translate that.   I believe the flavors have been dialed back for the \"demographic.\""}
{"text":"We ordered off the menu on a rainy late afternoon. I've never been here before but have tried their chicken at The Taste. The food blew my socks off; it was crazy good. Order the chicken wings!! Jerk chicken is on point too!  Service was slow, rude, and it felt like we were putting her out by coming in."}
{"text":"The jerk pork is the best around.  Couple it with the vegetables (zag cut cabbage, carrots etc, lightly cooked but still crunchy and spiced)  and you have an awesome combination that makes a great sandwich too.  The staff are very friendly and would get better marks but for the atmosphere.   We totally expected casual (no worries mon).  Clean, but a little sprucing up would go a long way.  Fresh ceiling tiles and light bulbs.  The old Taco Bell menu screens would make for a great mural canvas."}
{"text":"Food was ok, place was dingy, and the staff was very rude.  Don't expect a menu, refills, or a check without having to get up and find somebody to ask.  When we walked in we were informed \"you can't sit where you want\" and it went down hill from there.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Got the jerk pork, steamed veggies and rice.   Got a large portion and.   It. Was.  AMAZING.  I love it. So much flavor ! Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Small. Bad parking. The sort of service you'd expect in a country known for... well, being Jamaica. The food is great. Lunch buffet is the perfect blend of meat and spiced meat and BBQ meat. Pig and Chicken deluxe. I don't know about Vegan/Veggie options. Price isn't bad. Can get crowded. I like it very much. Recommend for lunchtime."}
{"text":"Nice flavor in there Chicken Curry. Also plenty of food served with the dinners. Service was fast."}
{"text":"I ordered goat curry and fried plantains for dinner...let me just say Mmmazing!   The food had excellent flavor, beautiful aroma and just simply lovely. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Best catfish EVER. Insane potato salad. Great solid Jamaican food. Nothing fancy. If I could change 3 things...more napkins, better air conditioning and for goodness sake, please fix the inner door. It slams every time someone walks through it. It can really get on your nerves. My husband and I joked you could tell the regular customers by those who caught the door and those who let it slam."}
{"text":"Check out all my reviews at theglobeonmyplate.blogspot.com  I am just now discovering David's Jamaican in Monona. And boy do I wish I heard about this place 10 years ago! Ever since I got an office in Monona I've been looking for a great lunch place. David's Jamaican is at the very top of the list.  I've eaten Jamaican food a couple of times over the years, and it's never really impressed me. It hasn't been something I crave. Jolly Bob's makes some tasty food. But to be honest, the \"jerked\" foods I've made at home were a lot better then the stuff I had eaten out.  I figured I just didn't like Jamaican food all that much... I was wrong. Yeah I said it... I was wrong.  David's Jamaican, in my mind, had quite a few strikes against it before I went. It was Jamaican food, which I wasn't thrilled about, it is a lunch buffet place, which rarely has great food, and I tend to overeat at those (Eye is greater than Stomach syndrome.) I think that's why it took me more then 6 months of working nearby to try the place out.  We went right as they were opening, an absolutely key to going to any buffet place, the food will be at it's freshest and will have been poked by the fewest amount of 6 year olds. The service was not exactly warm, but efficient.  Fried Catfish. OMG. This is just so perfectly done. Nice fresh catfish nuggets in a flavorful batter fried golden brown and crispy. They were still nicely crispy even in the buffet! Such a great flavor in the batter, but it didn't overwhelm the great catfish flavor either! With a bit of red beans and rice, which is a deceptively simple dish.  The waitress brought over a couple of spiciness levels of jamaican jerk sauces in squeeze bottles without us having to ask. This brought the whole meal to another level!  Their jerked pork was a freaking revolution in my mouth. This more then any other dish made me immediately realize I had wasted the last 6 months on burritos and sandwiches. Sweet and vinegary, with a strong jerk spice level. This pork has me coming back again and again. This pork is tender and so flavorful, but with a nice meaty texture which only come from long long stewing.  Fried chucks of chicken breast in a mango sweet/spicy sauce. Tangy, sweet, and made with high quality chicken. In this age of mechanically separated chicken, it's good to see somewhere which doesn't cater to the lowest common denominator.  The amazing food just goes on and on,  And everything is tastier then the last. The buffet turns out to be the way to go. At least for a first time to David's Jamaican.  I was absolutely thrilled with everything that I tried. That is something I have almost never ever said at a buffet.  Check out all my reviews at theglobeonmyplate.blogspot.com"}
{"text":"the deep fried catfish!!!    as others mentioned, the Friday evening buffets are really worth it.  About $10 per person.  You can try all the tasty meats and side dishes.  I like that they also have a salad bar with fresh cut watermelon, at least the night we were there.   And we got to meet David!  The guy harboring all the secret recipes of the menu in his head.   The interior is very divey and I wouldn't change a thing."}
{"text":"We had the cow tail stew and curry shrimp. Ok, I'll make this short.  Food - both are very tasty. I'm more impressed with the stew. Decor - not fancy, but clean and relax. Service - decent  I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Great food.  The buffet is best on fridays. True jamaican experience.  The homemade jerk sauce is fabulous. It can be bought there or at Kens. Don't come if you cant handle the less than ideal set up. (Its a bit sketch just like real jamaican joints.) Owners are great people."}
{"text":"We missed Jamaica tonight so we thought we'd hit up the buffet and take our little one out (he's 9 months!). Prior to our little Babe, we frequented their Friday night buffet, and love anything \"jerk\" on their menu. The jerk and citrus sauces are my absolute favorite! They are amazing, even with just the rice and steamed veggies!   However, the two star rating is due to tonight's experience. We got in around 6:30 and sat ourselves. I asked for a high chair and the waitress said they were around the corner. So, I helped myself and found neither of the two available had functioning straps/clasp and sticky. We still used one, wiped it ourselves and kept our Babe close. My Hubs and I both had two rounds of food, and while we were there, never had the plates cleared or our water refilled. The restaurant only had a few other tables but the waitress kept busy chatting with patrons. The food was flavorful since sauces were on point, but some meat items could have been warmer.   In addition, the door slammed loudly every time people came in and out. You could say that was also bothersome to us.   Our total came up to $29 and some change. A $3 tip was left on the table."}
{"text":"We just moved to Madison. A co-worker goes to David's all the time and won't stop talking about it. So I scooped up my wife and we drove the 20 mon to David's   Wow that was good  My wife had the Jamaican National dish and I had the jerk pork. Both were out of this world as was the jerk sauce.  Perfect favors. (the beef patties were not spicy- kinda boring)  Would I go there again?  Of course. Will it be soon. Probably Monday (closed Sunday )  The nice woman who waited on us.... Very helpful when I said it was my first time there. God bless you.   We are from Miami- where the Jamaican SUCKED. This was awesome"}
{"text":"I was a long time patron of Jamerica, but as the years have gone by it has become hit and miss depending on who's cooking, and I was looking for another Jamaican option.  Finally got around to trying David's and I wish I'd done so a long time ago.  We have gotten jerk chicken, jerk ribs, rice and peas (beans), mixed vegetables, plantains, and beef patties.  The jerk is excellent but it needs the extra sauce they provide and I will probably ask for additional sauce next time.  Plantains were also excellent.  Beef patties were more bread than meat, but were huge for $3.  They recently moved from one depressing former fast food restaurant to another.  The former Taco Bell at least had some character-- vaulted ceilings and an interesting layout.  But the former Burger King is bigger which I am sure is better for them.  They are still in the process of fixing it up.  It's just David and Pauline cooking so if there is a crowd you can wait up to 30 minutes for your food."}
{"text":"Do not let the old taco bell building fool you there is nothing fast food about David's. Homemade food and pasted down recipes make this family restaurant top notch. The service is good as long as you understand the man getting your drinks is also cooking your food. So please be patient because the reward is amazing. Small menu but huge flavor, try this place for date night or first date the atmosphere is great for getting to know each other and the patio is great for enjoying a drink and relaziing after filling your belly."}
{"text":"The people at David's are so friendly and helpful. They catered our wedding last month, and everyone raved about the food. A particular favorite was the banana cake, so be sure to get an order of that for your event!"}
{"text":"The moment we walked in you can smell the amazing Jerk seasoning. Sat down and you can tell it is a very friendly family owner restaurant that makes you feel like family :) We ordered the Goat Curry and the Country Catfish Dinner, and every single bite had so much flavor it's not overwhelming at all! I can't wait to come back and try the other dishes!!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing for their lunch buffet! I love their mango chicken and banana cake! I'm not sure if it's just the food or what, but the Pepsi seems to taste different. In a good way, though. I usually hate Pepsi. The environment of the place is really relaxed. I love going here."}
{"text":"I love it!  The Jerk chicken is fantastic, with authentic flavor.  The veggies are amazing, I love the spicey kick to them, personally I always get the potato salad cause I am not a fan of beans and rice but they usually are out of the potato salad, so I just get extra veggies!  The food is great."}
{"text":"The best reuse of a wee Taco Bell building EVER! This gem of Monona offers up authentically flavorful Jamaican food that will charm your palate without emptying your wallet. Affordable, friendly, and offering something for everyone who appreciates homemade, generous meals, from the vegetarian's delightful jerk tofu to the scotch bonnet catfish (personally, one of my favorite meals in all of Dane County) to the jerk steak. I can't stress enough the quality of eating the Caribbean food made in David's kitchen -you'll never go back to bottled jerk sauce again."}
{"text":"The best Jamaican in town bar none. The jerk pork dinner is my go-to takeout - the red beans and rice are perfection, the pulled jerk pork melts in your mouth, and the cabbage, carrot, and pepper veggies are so good that I always order an extra side of them! I always have leftovers for several days, which I savor. My partner and I even write our names on our takeout containers, as we are not inclined to share.   David's Jamaican is one of the few restaurants I gush about - it is absolutely worth the trip! I much prefer to get takeout, as the bright yellow and green plastic interior is not the most enjoyable: come for the food, don't expect great service or ambiance."}
{"text":"This is the best i have had in the Madison area so far.   Appetizer: Plantains- sweet and yummy Entr√©e: Jerk pork, potato salad (great Caribbean style), Cabbage (ok) The jerk pork (shredded) is nice,tasty and tender. FYI..this is not the way  Jerk pork is usually served (usually whole pieces of pork c, cut up).  The jerk snapper...a bit disappointing...i was looking for a whole fish.  Although my meal was Delicious. It did not taste like usual jerk seasoning. It was the cousin...lol   I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a late lunch in Monona, and we were really hungry. David's Jamaican Cuisine was just what we needed! Price was very reasonable, and I like the laid back atmosphere and reggae. I tried a little of almost everything on the buffet and was generally pleased. Highlights were: the rich, juicy, fall apart jerk pulled pork with a little extra jerk sauce; the BBQ pork, which had an amazing molasses and jerk-spiced sauce; lightly breaded and fried mango chicken; a piece of fried fish which wasn't labelled, but was tasty, flaky, and spiced just right; super moist but not overly sweet chocolate coconut rum cake; and of course sweet fried plantains! The buffet was running a little low, but it was late for lunch, and everything was still appropriately hot or cold. Service was friendly, if a little hands-off, which I don't mind at a buffet. I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"The food here is awesome.  It is a small family owner restaurant and is probably overlooked based on the appearance of the place.  Every time I'm in Madison, I make it a priority to go here.  Try the Jerk Pork and the fried plantains.  SO. GOOD!"}
{"text":"Love the jerk chicken! Ambiance gets a C-, but the food gets an A!"}
{"text":"Tried their food at The Taste of Madison and loved it.  Went on a Friday and had the buffet with my wife.  Jerk chicken, pork, curried chicken, and fried plantains.  All were very good.  We will be going back."}
{"text":"A fun place to visit! Especially if you like spicy food and meat.   We did the buffet----it's kind of small but it includes a pretty good assortment of dishes + seasoned meats....I think there were a few types of chicken, curries, shredded pork, catfish, beef etc.   The jerk sauce on the table was amazing----so good we had to buy a bottle to bring home. The rum punch was delicious (and potent).   For some reason I wasn't expecting a Jamaican Restaurant to have Chicken Dumpling soup, but they did and it was great!  The atmosphere is 'fun' but not 'romantic'. It seemed to be busy & buzzing and everyone there seemed to be having a good time."}
{"text":"Yummy food the buffet is the best time to go. They have all the essentials of good Caribbean food during the lunch buffet highly recommend that instead of take out or ordering."}
{"text":"First impression: ohmygosh it smells so good!  After that though, I wasn't very impressed. The food was good, but they were out of several options on the buffet, some of the foods were clearly not freshly prepared, and I didn't get the impression that cleanliness mattered much to them.  We tried really  hard to like David's, but I can't give more than two stars."}
{"text":"I don't think you could get any less pretentious than this joint. There's no apologies here. Come for the food, not for the ambience... or service for that matter. I've never had a gripe about their food, it is always delicious. The other aspects however, are definitely begging for improvement.   One time we brought the in laws here. We were served by an older woman who seemed to be very displeased... By us? We were the picture of politeness. She was cold-faced, grumbly, incredibly unwelcoming. I was so embarrassed. Other times the service has just been Luke-warm. But like I said, the food is awesome, and I've noticed a lot of take out orders happening here-- but beware, twice I've called to order take out DURING business and they DID NOT answer the phone!! :/"}
{"text":"The food is great and the staff is friendly.    You gotta stop by for the lunch buffet, that is when it is at its best.  The mango chicken is awesome, it is like general tsos chicken but with a delicious mango fruity sauce, interesting and delicious.  they have offerings of a variety of smoked and seasoned meat and a small salad bar.  It is a highly recommened joint in Monona.    Only thing wrong with it is the old building that it is in.  I frequent Davids so it can't be that bad."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in Madison. It is a hidden gem, serving delicious, authentic Jamaican cuisine. The owners are originally from Jamaica and having visited the island several times myself, it's about as good as you can get outside of Jamaica. The curried goat is amazing and the prices are very reasonable. The owners are very charming. I never leave the establishment disappointed."}
