{"text":"I grew up eating authentic Mexican food. Both of my grandmothers are fantastic cooks so I'm not easily impressed. But this place.... hold onto your tacos because, ay dios mio, it's so good!!!! The owner Gerardo is so kind and took awesome care of us! We brought our entire family for a birthday, and he treated us like royalty!!! Get ready for some good good food!!!"}
{"text":"The staff was friendly and the eating area was clean.  The chicken cooking smell was amazing when you first walked in.  

Great Chicken with beans and rice.  

We will definitely be back when we get that BBQ chicken craving."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch- loved every bite!  The food was amazing with top notch service.  
Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I was craving grilled chicken and this little hole in the wall did not disappoint. Their chicken is moist and delicious and so are their chips and salsa and beans and rice. My friend who ordered the carne asada taco said it was really good. This place is clean and offers wonderful service. 
Two things...
1. You order, sit down, and they bring out your food. You pay after you are finished like a sit down restaurant except they don't bring you a check.
2. They charge you a dollar for using your cc or dc."}
{"text":"I love this place! They always deliver to my business on time.. their flavors real original and fresh."}
{"text":"I come here twice a year when I don't feel like driving to Filibertos. It is ok but only a choice made on proximity. I never had anything here that is better or equal to most bertos"}
{"text":"Wow! Really good food! I had the half chicken with beans and rice. Very flavorful and cooked perfect! Not dry at all. Loved the beans and the grilled jalapeño that came with the meal. Definitely will be a routine lunch spot for me!"}
{"text":"Heard a lot of good things about this place but was sadly disappointed when trying it for the first time. After ordering when to use the bathroom which was through the kitchen live Roaches on the floor as well as dead ones in the bathroom. Still tried to stick around, customer service was horrible, food was okay to taste. Just when we thought things couldn't get any worse when getting up from our table nearly tripped over a rat trap that was next to the table we were dining at. Picking up the tray to take it to the trash can a roach run across our table disgusting went home sick to my stomach and threw up. I will never be back here."}
{"text":"Had the family here for dinner. First impression, the owner and workers were beyond helpful and kind during our entire visit. The food was exceptionally good. We had an assortment of tacos, nachos and tostadas. Every single thing we order and ate was very good and authentic. The meat is grilled over an open grill. The flavors and spices were so prominent and authentic. We will deferent be coming back here very soon. This our new spot!!!"}
{"text":"Fabulous little Mexican grilled chicken place. Very small, only 5 tables inside but the food is great!!!"}
{"text":"Wow! If I could give them 10 stars I would!!! Best Mexican food I've had in a while. They have a 4 taco plate combo that's 9.99 and we got 2 to try the steak and chicken and I couldn't decide which one was better! The chicken was deliciously flavored and the steak was cooked perfectly! Not to mention the workers were so kind and polite:) also they gave us the yummiest chips and salsa with it! Will definitely be back here and plan on telling all of my friends that it's a must try! If you're wondering if you should go here the answer is YES! You won't regret it. Thank you Pollo Picante for making my tummy so happy."}
{"text":"Their tacos beat Bigo Taco's on Mesa Dr/Broadway by a long shot. The beans were amazing!"}
{"text":"This place is legit! Excellent grilled chicken and best steak taco I've ever had, well worth it"}
{"text":"The best grilled chicken in town, just got even better!!  We've been ordering their chicken delivery since shortly after the restaurant opened, and it has always been very go
od!  Recently, the chicken has been even more moist and tasty than in the past!  And the beans are now just a bit spicier and tastier than before!  We highly recommend Pollo Picante!!"}
{"text":"This is one of those hidden gem hole in the wall. Walking into the place, the smell of the barbecue chicken is amazing. The barbecue itself was filled with chicken and carne. The owner noticed it was our 1st time there and gave us a small piece if chicken. It was amazing. I ordered chicken tacos and a chicken thigh. The were delicious. I highly recommend this place! I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The flavor is definitely there, the chicken spices are extremely well balanced but pungent at the same time. The salsa offered with the meal is also really good and has a solid kick afterthought. The rice is nice and moist (tip:add the salsa into the rice for extra flavor). The pasta is meh! Wouldnt recommend. Not so great is the customer service, the owners are always standing around talking which seems unprofessional. We also tried the carne asada which was simply okay. For grilled chicken though this is the place to go, infinitely trumps Pollo Loco."}
{"text":"Wow, wow, wow... very good marinated chicken cooked over mesquite carbon. We had the whole chicken with sides and tortillas for $15 and half a pound of carne asada for $12. The chicken amazed, the steak was average.( needs to be cooked longer over the carbon). Mexican Coke, thrifty ice cream, salsas galore. Excellent flour tortillas and my wife enjoyed the corn tortillas. We venture to Mexico often and this place is right on par on what we
as foodies have discovered south of the border. The young staff were all bilingual and spoke kind and respectful in both languages. Next time you want an authentic grilled Mexican meal, this is your place."}
{"text":"I work across the street and have been waiting for a good place to eat nearby and finally I have what I wanted. Pollo Picante is not just good it's Great! Before you even walk in the door you begin to smell the amazing chicken on the grill. The menu is simple, bbq grilled chicken and a few different sides. They serve some of the best chicken I have ever had. The owner has a passion about what he does and his recipe is great! 

The place is extremely clean. The staff is very nice and friendly. The prices are a great value. I'm a loyal customer already. Everyone should try this place!"}
{"text":"Such a great chargrilled chicken! Tender, juicy with perfectly charred skin. Carne asada was very good. Chiles HOT and q guacamole was fresh and tasty. One word for this place YUM! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"After having gone to another similar chicken place in Tempe, my expectations were high. This place ismuch closer to home so we decided to stop in. 

There was no one dining when me and my friend showed up. The place was clean and the guy who took our order was friendly. We get our plates which consisted of chicken, (not spicy at all) tortillas, and I forget what else. I think it was rice. Unfortunately, our chicken was SUPER DRY and BLAND. It literally had no flavor :( I really wanted to love this place but the chicken was a disappointment . It's a chicken place, shouldn't the chicken be tasting great? Maybe I will give it another try and hope that next time it's at least seasoned..."}
{"text":"This place is so good, I love coming here and ordering the fries, their so good and the meat is always so tender and soft . Plus I love that their so close to my house and the staff is always so friendly and nice! Probably one of the best Mexican places I've been to!!!!"}
{"text":"GREAT chicken, lots of food for the money.  Staff has been very nice recently."}
{"text":"The best pollo & carne asada you will find! 

 The restaurant is tucked away in a small strip mall located close to Mesa's downtown area. Pollo Picante is immaculately clean and the staff greet you with a smile. There are several platters to choose from but it's pretty simple you pick if you want chicken or steak and pick your sides. 

 It's worth noting that all the side dishes are amazing and packed full of flavor, you get several different salsas including hot mild and medium along with some fresh guacamole that puts all others to shame. Additionally you get fresh grilled jalapeños, onions and some other vegetables which I didn't eat but it looks like nice. Pollo Picante does a great job with takeout orders & packed everything up very nicely.

In closing, if your taste buds are craving some amazing food at very good prices I highly recommend you visit this restaurant which is locally owned and family run and is a great option for satisfying some cravings."}
{"text":"I can't stay away!! They have the best grilled chicken. Of course everything is good. Small family run place with fabulous food."}
{"text":"Just happened to hear about this place on one of the Yelp talk threads. The conversation was pretty amusing. Either way the food here is really good.

Located in a really small strip center with a small eating area. These guys grill up some tasty Chicken. They have a simple menu with counter service and a delivery area that extends out about 5 miles. Nice!

Ordered the Half Chicken Plate with a side of Beans and Rice. It also comes with some spicy Chili Peppers, Pickled Red Onions, Lime, Tortillas and homemade Salsa. The Mexican sodas that they have are always a fun treat as well.

Service is very friendly and the ordering process is not very difficult. You can get a 1/4, 1/2 of whole chicken and they will cut it up and have it ready to go. 

Hoping they may eventually add some more proteins to the menu. How about a little marinated Beef, Pork or some spicy Shrimp.

I'm definitely a BIG FAN and recommend coming over and giving these guys a try. You will probably see me over here for an early lunch. The prices are reasonable and the portions are large enough to fill you up. QUE FANTASTICO!

4.25 STARS"}
{"text":"Food is really good but delivery and customer service is HORRIBLE  waited for my delivery for over 48 minutes when Im just 2 blocks down"}
{"text":"Loved their grilled chicken. Perfectly cooked, seasoned and priced. Had the 1/4 chicken combo plate. Came with hearty portion of rice and beans and some corn tortillas. Rice and beans tasted homemade. Fast and friendly staff. Might order to go next time, walked out smelling like charcoal."}
{"text":"Great little hole in the wall. Not a large place probably only 6 tables. We (family of 5) ordered the whole chicken. It came with 2 sides and we chose the beans and rice. Additional sides included pickled onions, salsa, and tortillas. The chicken had great flavor and was moist not dry. The only thing I thought was weird was the hotdog chunks in the pinto beans? Not bad just weird. Glad we found this place we will definately be returning as it reminds me of favorite spot in Rocky Point. This price is reasonable too, with 5 sodas and the whole chicken it was $27 dollars. 
- Gracias Pollo Picante"}
{"text":"This was a good find - neighborhood pollo place.

Friendly people serving tasty food - gotta love it!

I ordered the quarter chicken (dark meat) with rice and beans.  
Really good chow!  (Just needed something to clean off my fingers when I finished.)"}
{"text":"Seriously the BEST Chicken I have ever had. Fire grilled and the Jalapenos are awesome. Portions have always been plentiful and we have never had any issues. We have been eating here at least every other week since they have opened. It's crazy to mark a place bad because you saw a tiny little bug. It's Arizona they are everywhere. Even with an outside perimeter spray it still doesn't kill bugs instantly..... :)"}
{"text":"This place is a true hole in the wall. They are located in a small strip mall next to a generic dollar store. The inside of the location is small as well with a few simple tables and chairs. Do not let this fool you.... The menu doesn't have much on it, but what they do have they do well. :) 

Staff was friendly. They struggled to help me in English at first, I answered in Spanish and they definitely perked up. On a second visit in purposely didn't and while a little less lively, everyone was very nice and polite, so don't hesitate to check it out if you don't speak Spanish. 

I was able to use my Yelp deal and got 2 chickens, Mexican style macaroni salad (the place is called picante for a reason... It's spicy), frijoles de olla (beans stewed in some veggies and spicy chilies) yellow rice, tortillas, pickled onion and roasted jalapeños. It was so much food! The chicken is sooooo good! Well marinated, never dry and so darn good I still haven't tried the carne asada. My dad tried the tres leches cake and he loved it. 

They have a great buy one get one deal in Wed. So check them out!"}
{"text":"Good food! I have catered from here for my job for almost 2 years now. The owner is very nice and the food is always ready for pickup at the time we ask for it. My coworkers always request this food. I recommend it."}
{"text":"Not exaggerating but this is by far the best grilled chicken I've ever tasted! The service was fast, the people were nice. Their spanish rice are so good! I just hope they would offer dessert. But definitely still a 5star for me & my hubby!"}
{"text":"We just ate lunch here, the place is small but quite clean. The menu is simple, chicken and 4 different sides and a few drink options, mostly bottled drinks. The chicken is excellent, perfectly seasoned and cooked just right, not dry at all. The prices are quite reasonable!"}
{"text":"Holly Buckets this was good!

They do two things, Grilled Chicken and Grilled Beef, and man do they have it nailed. Great sides too... just awesome. 

Also the value! It was Cheep! I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This is by far the most delicious and flavorful Mexican food I've ever had! My husband is gluten intolerant so we pretty much live on Mexican food...and this was the best! We had pollo asada tacos and burritos that had incredible and complex flavors with perfect proportions of ingredients, and lean and moist chicken! The meat is cooked over an open fire mesquite grill. The salsa was fresh and so good that we bought extra to take home, even though we make our own fresh salsa at home, and have all the ingredients already. The owner and his wife were cooking away. They introduced themselves and welcomed us. 

I'll be honest, the parking lot and surrounding business's almost scared us away. But we are SO glad we tried it anyway and we will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I only wish I had found this place earlier!  It is amazing!  The salsa is the best I have had in Mesa!  They charcoal grill marinated chicken and steak.  Both are wonderful!  The tacos, quesadillas and burros are super tasty!  The service is friendly too!   They have Mexican sodas too.  I love the pollo plates but the carne asada tacos are hard to beat.  Give this place a try you'll love it!"}
{"text":"I have to change my previous review regarding this establishment, I have recently revisited this business and I have to say that I really enjoyed it, the sides still need some work but the Chicken is delicious.  

Service is very slow, I will never understand why businesses will pay more attention to phone orders. Customers that are in their business should be a priority, this is a practice that should be addressed by the business owner, physical customers should always have priority over phone orders, drive thru, and deliveries, it is a game changer for me.  I will leave and encourage others to do the same, after all we made the effort to come in and that should speak volumes."}
{"text":"What a great little find! 
A tiny little place that is obviously family run, tucked into a little strip mall next to a dollar store, who'd thunk they would make killer mexican bbq chicken, along with corn tortillas, beans with jalapeños, and salsa to die for! All for less than 9 bucks!! 
Eduardo runs the place, cooks the chicken, and locals are all over this place. As well they should be. Takeout seems to also be a big business for them. Super nice guy. If I lived around here I'd be back weekly."}
{"text":"The chicken is so tender, my mouth is already salivating just talking about it. 

- Seasoned to perfection
- Very kind service 
- Flame grilled on site 


And now that I just remembered how good it is, I'm going."}
{"text":"Seriously amazing!! Small and quaint and the food is so delicious. I recommend to anyone who wants a quick meal but doesn't want to give up quality."}
{"text":"This is a no nonsense place.  All they serve is charbroiled chicken and sides, but it's really good charbroiled chicken.  You smell the coals as soon as you walk in.  Not much for atmosphere, but a good lunch spot and a tasty alternative to El Pollo Grosso."}
{"text":"I like the chicken but I hate how I have gotten it raw in the past and the delivery service is awful one time i literally waited 3 hours for my chicken to get to me and I am only 5 minutes away, I cant leave because I own a store so I needed to get food delivered.  By the time they got to me I received raw chicken and I ended up having my worker get us some burgers so I ended up paying for the chicken plus burgers not satisfied at all."}
{"text":"I love roasted chicken so we went to check it out. We also had the 4 taco combo to sample both chicken and steak. Excellent! Moist flavorful chicken. The owner gave us a sample of breast meat on the side. My husband said it was the best chicken he'd ever had. Can't beat grilled meat in tacos or just alone. The owner and his wife introduced themselves, very nice and took that initiative. It's a small place so i can see there could be a wait if there was a rush so I'd just planfor it if it's during peek hours. However, we gotvthere at 6:30 on a tuesday and it wasn't empty but it was fast service. I can't imagine how wonderful it would be to have them cater a party."}
{"text":"I smelled the charcoal right when I walked in. The grill was right in front of my face loaded with JUICY chicken. It was a great first impression. I ate the taco combo. 2 carne asada and 2 pollo. The flavor of the meat was fantastic and these tacos came fully loaded. Guac, sour cream, jalapeños, cabbage, cheese, and some hot salsa on the side. I was stuffed eating all 4. The frijoles charros on the side were full of flavor and I could honestly just eat those with some flour tortillas. Not a huge salsa selection but sometimes simple is good. The chips were fresh and unfortunately there were a few that were a little on the burnt side but they went great with the salsa. Food took a little while to get but it was worth the 20 minute wait. I will definitely go back. Customer service was great! All employees were friendly!"}
{"text":"Holly yummy chicken and steak. I have been here three times in the last three weeks and all I can say is WOW! Do not be deceived by plaza or the size of the operation. Go on in and be greeted by the very friendly staff who will take your order. Then take a seat and let them bring you some freshly fried chips and homemade salsa. In no time flat their amazing chicken (best in town I've ever had), sides and steak will fill your taste buds to the rim. You must order the charro beans! I can just drink the sauce they cook the beans in they are mouth watering. You won't be able to get all that food in your stomach so take a doggie bag home. Then lastly pay for your amazingly priced meal! I don't hand out 5 stars too often, but this spot has it all."}
{"text":"We've been getting the pollo asado once a week for the last month or so and it has yet to disappoint. The seasoning is perfect, it's cooked perfectly, juicy on the inside and crispy on the out. The macaroni salad is as good as it gets for takeout. The whole chicken comes with 2 sides, salsa and tortillas. Amazing! And now as of today, I've probably had one of the best carne asada burritos! They add rice(not a big fan), beans, crema and cheese. It comes with a side salad and pickled onions. It's a large burrito and will fill you up instantly. Very warm staff!"}
{"text":"Ok. I will say this; I eat thousands of dollars in Mexican food every year. I have to say that this is the best Mexican food I have had. I mean literally the best. I've eaten hundreds of establishments. AMAZING. I'm not sure the word amazing is amazing enough. Let's start at the beginning...
You walk in to the sights and smell of the meat being grilled over a mesquite charcoal fire. We ordered our food  and the prices were very good. We ordered two taco combinations. And a Pollo asada burrito. They brought us fresh made salsa that was amazing with hot chips. The tacos came without too long of a wait, and they were amazing. The beans were amazing. The burrito was amazing. Are you seeing the theme here? It was amazing. Simply the best I've had."}
{"text":"1400th review! Why eat at El Pollo Loco when you can eat at the less crazy (And infinitely tastier) El Pollo Picante? This little restaurant in the midst of a strip mall serves up a delicious charcoal grilled chicken. When you step in the grilled aroma pleasantly surrounds you and you can see the cool grill set up they have in house. The menu is simple, which allows them to excel at what they do best- carne asada and pollo asado. I got a half chicken meal to go with rice and beans ($8.08). While I waited for my meal I took a seat and admired the spotlessly clean surroundings and small fridge with various bottled sodas. There is also a soda fountain behind the counter. 

My meal was packaged in a few minutes and I was quickly out the door. The chicken was a hearty size, and I probably only ate about 1/2 portion of my meal for lunch. The sides and salsa were a generous portion in to go cups. The flavors of everything were great. Excellently seasoned, and well balanced. Everything went well with each other. In addition to the chicken, salsa, and sides, a generous portion of warm corn tortillas, pickled onions, a slice of lime, and roasted jalapeño was included. I especially loved the roasted jalapeño, which was perfectly grilled with a spicy kick.

Service was friendly with a smile. Definitely a great place for grilled chicken. I'll have to come here next time to try the carne asada!"}
{"text":"The chicken is perfection. The rice- OMG. The price? Crazy affordable! The rats are stellar. Do yourself a favor and drop in."}
{"text":"This place sold my family & I raw chicken. Unfortunately we did not notice until we got home & began to eat. We took it back and received a cash refund. Be sure to inspect your chicken before you eat it or feed it to someone in your family"}
{"text":"Picante. Everything here is Picante in some way or another. For me that's a good thing, for other people, maybe not so much. The pollo was picante, the beans were picante, the cold pasta salad was picante. The fresh salad, rice and tortillas were not. I stopped by on a Wednesday night and they had a buy one (either half off or free, don't remember I am old). I bought the deal along with a cold 2 liter coke, which is a great deal for the price I paid. You want to know how much? I don't remember...

The chicken was delicious and had great flavor. One of the chickens was a tad bit dry but we still enjoyed it. The beans, cold salad and salsa were also great. Their red rice was so bland, i let my kids eat all of it. 

The place is small and clean. The girls working that afternoon were super nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Roach on the floor. I will post the pic for you or try. We got or money back for the food we had just ordered and they gave it back no prob other then the cook looked a little upset... Glad we saw it and didn't eat the food... was looking forward to eating here due to reviews.. to bad."}
{"text":"This place is an absolute joke. The server was on her cell phone on a very dramatic (and loud I might add) personal call, making eye contact yet completely ignoring us. Having no other choice we stepped up to the counter & ordered. 
The quarter chicken I was served must have been on a hunger strike, it looked like nothing more than an oversized quail. I was done with the leg in one bite, the thigh was gone in two. It was also overcooked & dry, not to mention bland. The side dishes too were nothing to brag about. 
The people on here who gave this place 4 & 5 stars should have their taste buds checked. Better yet, I would advise them to go to Costco & spend $5.99 on a full rotisserie chicken & see if they ever go back to this dump. 
What a total waste of money!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for some authentic Mexican charcoal fire grilled chicken, look no further! The chicken at Pollo Picante is great! The chicken was cooked perfectly over a charcoal flame and seasoned just right. Prices are great as well. Half a chicken, 2 sides, tortillas, grilled jalapeno, pickled onions, lime and salsa for less than $8! That's what I call a deal. Lucky for me the owner stopped into my place of business which is right down the street to let us know about his restaurant. Do yourself a favor and check them out. I am glad I did!"}
{"text":"The food is always amazing!! We can never decide which is better so we get both a full chicken and 1lb carne asada. Also the staff is friendly and helpful. We use Pollo Picante for catering large parties and for just a week night dinner at home. If you pick up from the restaurant be prepared, you will be drooling the whole time you're inside because it smells delicious, like grilled meats!!"}
{"text":"When you first step into the door you get that mouth watering grilling sensation. The smell of chicken grilling is intoxication. The service was done with with smiles and patience, as I didn't know what I was going to order. The menu is not complicated but after looking at the menu I wanted everything they had! I got a whole chicken chopped to perfection, rice moist not dry, and beans had wonderful flavor. I also ordered a carne asada taco just because I was interested in what it would taste like, I should have ordered 10! In short get your butt over there and taste some delicious food! \" CHICKEN CONNOISSEUR\""}
{"text":"Porqué no le di las 5 estrellas?
Porque los frijoles eran enlatados y no estaban muy buenos, pero el resto de la comida estaba muy rica."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Reminds me of my favorite joint in Rocky Point. The chicken is juicy, flavorful and cooked to perfection. The simple menu is done just how it should be. The only thing missing to make it perfect is some shredded cabbage. I personally also like a larger, thinner tortilla but the street tortillas they serve are good. 

Do not be put off by the slightly sketchy looking strip mall, this place is clean inside and the staff is friendly. 

The meals are a good value and you should try the pineapple drink."}
{"text":"A great lunch find!  We happened to be in the East Valley and made a special trip to this little gem after reading about it online. We ordered a two piece chicken meal and a half a chicken meal. My eyes were bigger than my stomach but I managed to eat every last delectable bite. The Chicken was moist and well seasoned. The Tortillas warm and pliable. The beans zesty and the rice was some of the best Mexican rice I have eaten. The dishes were accompanied with fresh cubes, pickled onions and lemon to add a punch to our meal. Great family owned restaurant. We will drive across town to eat here again. Wish it was in our hood."}
{"text":"Had 4 carne asada tacos and 1/2 of a pollo.  Food was delicious.  We were surprised how favorable the side of beans tasted.  Adding in some Mexican Coke and Jaritos, the meal was really good.  Grilled jalapeños were also great.  The ambiance of Univision blaring in the background leaves much to be wanting.  Also, the cashier was very nice but had some difficulty with English communication .  However, it's a solid 4+ stars for the food itself."}
{"text":"After reading other reviews, I  expected to be wowed by the food.  We ordered street tacos and a chicken burrito.  The tacos were very good, as were the side of beans, full of flavor and nicely spiced.  The burrito,  on the other hand,  was heavy on rice and light on chicken.  It also had quite a bit of gristle and some unidentified crunchy somethings I  suspect weren't supposed to be there.  I may return to try a grilled chicken plate,  which looked good,  but the expectations are now much lower."}
{"text":"I had been looking for this type of restaurant, the only one i found was \"pollo supremo\" but it isn't even close to this \"pollo picante\" i loved it and I am there on a regular basis. I highly recommend it. Place is very clean, delicious and GREAT service. If you ever consider in getting chicken, you DEFINITELY have fo try this one."}
{"text":"Nothing but delicious grilled steak and chicken here! Their pinto beans have a kick of jalapeño and aren't just plain beans like most places. The owner is always very welcoming and friendly the 2 times we have come. Definitely need to be coming here more regularly!!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service! I had a variety of chicken, steak and dessert and it was all excellent. From the moment you walk in the doors and smell that grill you will know what I mean."}
{"text":"Muy Rico!! Came to try the pollo asado which was outstanding. Crispy perfectly charred skin. Tender and juicy. The red rice was some of the best I've ever had. Very flavorful with each grain light, fluffy and separate ( can't stand gummy rice). The salsa was made with fresh tomatoes and was perfectly spicy. So good I could drink it. As a matter of fact we enjoyed our meal so much we came back the next day to try out the carne asada tacos. Good call ! They were beyond delicious. We also had the beans which where brothy and perfectly done. Not too soft not too hard just right. Going back tomorrow for the pork tacos and the elote asada. Thank you Yelp for the lunchtime suggestion. We might have missed out on this great experience had it not been for Yelp. This is definitely our new place."}
