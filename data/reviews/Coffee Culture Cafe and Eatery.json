{"text":"3.5/5!   I'm a big fan of Coffee Culture, it's been a key spot for after school meetings, dates with my mom, and ideal for catch ups. Seating is pretty ideal with some booths and outdoor seating (beautiful for the summer!). Free WIFI and very friendly servers. Prices are okay.....cheaper than Starbucks but sorta the same idea. I'm not always a fan of their sandwiches cause they're inconsistent with flavors but their hot and cold beverages and baked goods are delicious.   Just a recommendation, but their hot chocolate is perfect. I find the timmies one is too sweet but this one is yummy. I recommend you go for a catch up with your friends:)"}
{"text":"I love this place. Their coffee is fresh and aromatic... Their ultimate grilled cheese is probably the healthiest grilled cheese I have ever had. It has tomatoes, wheat bread, and I think there was lettuce. I don't remember since I ate it quite fast. It's a great place to chill and also get some work done."}
{"text":"I have been to coffee culture on various occasions and it never fails to... We'll never impress. Not really a knock because it isn't a bad coffee shop, but it's coffee is very mediocre. Locations are typically larger than you typical Starbucks so it is good for social and professional meet ups."}
{"text":"I've been here once, and with coupons the food is pretty good price. The sandwich I ordered  tasted very good and no doubt the cakes/desserts are probably really yummy.  The main/only reason I rate this a 3 is because of the quality of coffee. This might've just been the one time I went there or maybe my personal taste, but coffee being the main part of my meal i was looking forward to, the dark roast coffee I ordered with only two creams came watered down, with sugar added, and had a slight flavour/chemical like taste I couldn't make out. I drank most of it, it wasn't bad but if I was being picky I would say it was definitely not good either! Being that it's called coffee culture I was quite disappointed as compared to what my expectations were."}
{"text":"Wasn't prepared for how busy it was going to be on a Sunday afternoon. But the quality of food, drink, and service is unparalleled in Mississauga. I recommend this place for anyone looking for quality coffee products but not for a quiet outing..."}
{"text":"Such excellent cake options with cozy sitting area for quiet relaxation or hanging with a group :)"}
{"text":"A friend and I came here for a \"coffee meeting\" where we worked on a project together over a yummy breakfast bagel and a very good cup of coffee. The atmosphere is very chic and quiet (this was a Tuesday morning), and looks bigger on the inside than it does on the outside (but it is still on the small side). We each had the two breakfast bagels (Asiago and Power if I remember correctly) and they were both fresh and very filling. The white chocolate mocha that I had was the perfect sweetness and I highly recommend it. The service was okay, they weren't  super friendly but they did their job. Unfortunately the wifi didn't work for either of our laptops or our phones which was disappointing and in the end, we walked over the the McDonalds nearby after just to use their wifi (which is quite sad..) Overall, I'll probably be back with friends to catch up over a cup of coffee, but not to study or expect to be productive!"}
{"text":"I frequent this coffee shop to study and on some occasions to catch up with friends for a quick coffee.  I love the ambience of this place. I wish it was slightly larger and had more seating as in the winter time when it's cold out you're limited to seating inside and I've had my fair share of experiences where I had to wait around for someone to leave.   In terms of the food and service, the staff is always polite and courteous. Food prep is fast and always tastes amazing. I always order s mochaccino and a spinach and feta twist. I'd recommend this to anyone whose looking for a coffee place that isn't Tim Hortons or Starbucks."}
{"text":"Coffee culture is a high end coffee/tea/late spot with lots of beautiful cakes and snacks to feast on. Any time day or night is good.  Try the grilled sandwiches :)  Also lots of seating with fireplaces and tvs And free wifi"}
{"text":"This place just saved my morning. I'm a temporary transplant in Toronto (from SF) and travel out to Mississauga now and then for work. Arriving hours early for a meeting I needed a place to hang out, grab some coffee and jump online and found Coffee Culture here on Yelp. After bypassing a Tim Horton's drive-thru I finally found this spot and it way exceeded my expectations. There's plenty of comfy seating, free wifi, pleasant service and really good espresso. The egg and cheese sandwich was not great (microwaved eggs and processed cheese) but for what I needed I'm stoked to be here."}
{"text":"Decent place if you're looking for a place to catch up with friends. I had a small nutella fredduccino which is creamy and thick, sort of like a milkshake. Tasted alright, not too sweet but I don't believe their \"whipped cream\" is real whip as mine had a bit of a funny aftertaste. I suspect it is instead, \"whipped topping\" which is unfortunate. This place gets full and quite loud in the evening so make sure you're here early. Overall, friendly staff and generally clean!"}
{"text":"The coffee at this place isn't bad, so its good to check it out. where as the place is concerned the inside is very small and usually packed on the weekend evenings. There are various types of seatings from couches, chairs, high chairs, to booths and plus they have a patio in the summer.  For the internet lovers, they have Wifi."}
{"text":"Great and comfortable place for a coffee if you're looking to chill with friends and just catch up! My friend and I had printed off a coupon for a free specialty coffee, and enjoyed a nice drink for over two hours.  I got a skinny hazelnut latte, while my friend got a caramel latte. My hazelnut latte was noticeably lighter than his full milk latte, but was still very good! The coffee flavour was sufficiently strong, and the milk very frothy and tasty. Although we both ordered smalls, the coffee cup was very large and equivalent to a soup portion. I loved the fact that the lattes came with a biscotti cookie!  The service is very friendly and kind, and they were very accepting of our free drink coupons (I know of many restaurants that aren't). They also have free Wi-Fi, so it's great for those who want to sit down and do some work. Keep in mind, however, that bring a coffee shop there is a constant buzz around and about."}
{"text":"Coffee is okay.. Food is good. Wifi is below average :( it's nice inside though so it's a good time with friends. For studying... Not so much."}
{"text":"I love their creative drinks and desserts. The tables are also big and the location is well lit and isn't too crowded which makes for an ideal studying location"}
{"text":"I can do coffee from pretty much anywhere as long as its strong and has milk and sugar.  What made this place stand out was how inviting it was, comfy seating by the fireplace and great service.   I only had a coffee and a croissant this time but will be popping by again to get their menu - salads, sandwiches etc. Great ambiance and really busy! !"}
{"text":"I have been coming here on and off for about 5 years.   So this is my quick review, decent food, decent coffee (black coffee taste better than tims)  I like their cake selection. Especialy carrot cheese cake.  They have comfortable seating and good service    A lot of UTM students hang out here ad study  They have a patio, provide ashtrays and small dogs are allowed .   This is good place to meet clients or freinds or by yourself if you would get some work down out side ."}
{"text":"This is my father-in-law's favorite place to chat and grab a coffee.  (And it's becoming ours too.)  We're also fans of Second Cup, but, lately when visiting we've been driving a little out of the way to go to Coffee Culture instead of Second Cup.  What tips the scale in Coffee Culture's favor is the prices and the sandwich selection.    I personally would prefer more tea-infused choices on the beverage menu, but I love their grilled veggie panini sandwich (vegan friendly if you ask for it without cream cheese).  Also, their hot coca comes in a huge fat mug for only $1.50.   Also, they have much better tables and booths, and little nooks too.  Oh, and a fireplace along with free wi-fi."}
{"text":"Amazing place to go on a first date. The atmosphere is clam and welcoming, there is plenty of space to find a great cozy spot, lots of coffee and desert options and quick serve. This is also a good place to study, they have booth areas where many students meet up to study. The best thing about this place is their coffee mocha and sierra turkey sandwich. If your looking for a quiet place to relax and get a quick bite to eat, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"They have a nice patio and comfy couches.  However, Wi-Fi is iffy and it is hard to tell which is their network. The cashier told me it was \"cafe 1220\", there was also a a \"cafe 1220 media\", and two other networks that started with \"coffee culture\". Not a big deal, since I have a data plan and can use my own personal hotspot, but I am with Wind, so my data is kind of slow.    Anywho, the cafe itself is pretty nice and there's a big booth that can fit around 8 people, which would be good for group gatherings and a small patio.  While the patio is nice, it looks onto the street, so not the most appealing unless you want to breathe car fumes.  Ah, the joys of living in the suburbs.  As for the food itself, I ordered an Asiago bagel sandwich.  The bagel itself was pretty good as it was panini pressed, but the problem is with the content of the sandwich.  The bacon was average, but the egg was terrible.  It tasted like those horrible Subway eggs, which are pre-cooked, frozen, then put into the oven again.  2/5 for the sandwich.  However, I also had the organic coffee and it had a good earthy flavour.  3/5.    As for the atmosphere, it's nice, but nothing special. 3/5.  Overall, 2.5/5, but rounding up."}
{"text":"Good service. Nice Coffee. Great Desserts. Always full on Friday nights.   The coffee is a bit on the expensive side but you are paying for the ambience. Popular with millennials. It is always packed in Friday nights I have been here.   The staff is amazing and accommodating."}
{"text":"More quiet than Star bucks or Timmy's of course. Small coffee shop. Fast and friendly service due to not many customers were there. Clean shop. I didn't order any coffee so I can't tell you how it tasted but my girlfriend seems to be fine with it. Good coffee spot for catching up with old friends to talk."}
{"text":"Nice little cozy place to come out with your significant one and order expensive hot beverages. I have been here a few times. Sometimes this places can get very busy with all the teens from the church across the street. But overall a good place with friendly staff."}
{"text":"Great seats, view, breakfast, snack and drink offerings. Quiet, great place to relax, catch up. Love their pistachio cream filled muffin. They have Belgian waffles with toppings for about $6-$9. People come here to study. I like the little nook with the tv.  It feels really cozy when there's snow outside. I really like the ambiance."}
{"text":"I was traveling with my friends from Buffalo and we just had to stop by Coffee Culture since they don't have them by us anymore. This location made us remember how much we loved the brand. The service was amazing and they even gave us a free cookie! This is definitely a must see destination if you're in Mississauga!"}
{"text":"We went to coffee culture for a Saturday morning brunch. The had comfortable seating, friendly staff and good food.  I had the strawberry banana and ice cream waffle and it was so yummy.  It was a large waffle topped with a big scoop of ice cream, lots of fruit (mostly bananas) and sprinkled with sugar and chocolate drizzle.  It was a large and delicious waffle and it satisfied my sweet tooth!"}
{"text":"I have to lower my review for this place, I haven't had this poor of customer service in a long time. We came here for a latte and cake for my boyfriends birthday. I have never given 1 star before but as I have previously stated I was saving it for when something was inedible or in this case not drinkable.  We order the pumpkin spice latte, a drink I have had here before and many other places. My first sip I was worried it had the taste of mold, like the syrup had gone bad. My boyfriend agreed it was not good and went up to talk to them. The owner told him that's how it is supposed to taste and sent him back with it. Now I went up because it was actually so bad I couldn't drink it. She took a spoon full of it, tasted it and said that is correct and that they made it to standard. She said I would have to pay to have a replacement plain latte but would offer me a coffee without paying. She claims that it was our taste so they do not need to replace it.  This is one of the worst examples of customer service I have ever encountered. We tried to reason with her, she was adamant about losing two customers that brought in regular revenue over a latte that would cost them pennies to replace. So not only are they serving a drink that tasted like mold but they alienate their customers. Never thought coffee culture would get my first 1 star, congratulations?"}
{"text":"The place is nice and the staff is friendly.   However, if you are looking to sit here and work for long hours then there are two cons  1) it can get very noisy 2) they have the worst internet service I have ever come across in any cafe."}
{"text":"You'd probably miss this place unless you were actually in the plaza.  Personally the only reason I found it is because the Metro hadn't opened yet.  If you look towards Eglinton from the parking lot you'll notice a small building, yup... that's Coffee Culture.  It's pretty much what you're expecting about a coffee cafe, chairs, coffee, soups, couches and the best thing about this place... a fireplace.  Although it's in a little nook, those that do take advantage of the premium fireplace seats will be rewarded with a cozy electric fireplace and a big lcd hanging on the wall above it.  This coffee spot has it's normal varieties; the menu carries muffins, sandwiches, soups and bagels, oh and coffee and tea.  I got a cup of coffee and an english muffin sandwich with sausage.  Personally I don't think the sandwich was all too amazing by itself, but the thing that made it stand out was that they panini pressed it.  What a great idea!  All breakfast sandwiches from this point forth should be panini pressed.  That's right, McDonalds, Timmys and others... panini press investment, STAT.  Otherwise, the coffee was actually quite good.  Better than most of your other coffee slinging joints, but again not amazing.  I wish this place was in my building instead of what is there right now... which will remain nameless."}
{"text":"Coffee Culture is very easy to miss in this plaza. The only reason I first found it was because I was trying to find good date places (it worked btw, married the girl I took here).   The fact that this location is easy to miss, adds quality to the clientele that come here.  The vibe in here is very casual, but still offers the finer things in life (cheesecake, n'uff said!) I'm not a huge coffee connoisseur, so saying that this coffee is better than somewhere else isn't going to help you.   What will help you are the following points:  -very chill atmosphere -first-date meetup place -classy -fantastic selection of cakes and pastries  As a coffee place, the only way they would've been better is by offering more cheesecake.   TL;DR: great hidden gem of Mississauga"}
{"text":"Great Coffee Culture location to work or grab a bite. Why not both?   I usually get the chicken Caesar wrap with a soup and coffee. The soups have all been good, although if you come too early, they may not be available.   I quite enjoy the weekends when my boyfriend and I would get a big table by the window, order brunch, and work the morning alway."}
{"text":"I give this place a 3.5-4. I use to come here every Friday to study for the past 2 years. I would suggest to come in early, it gets really busy from 5-close and finding a table is such a pain sometimes.   You can't go wrong with any of their coffees but I always order their organic green tea a side of panini or a muffin. Their pistachio muffin is new and is now my fave! It's not too sweet, I wish there was a hint of Cardamom to bring out the pistachio flavor but this is good enough and the nutty topping is very satisfying knowing this muffin isn't just a pistachio muffin by its neon green color.   They have free Wi-fi, sometimes it's slow but  when the place isn't busy I find the connection works fast. This place is good for a group meeting, coffee dates, or a place to just hangout and study"}
{"text":"I'm only giving this place 4 stars because of the LACK of cafes in Mississauga. Relative to the other places in the area, they have really nice decor, good food, and average drinks.   Sometimes their WiFi doesnt work so its really annoying cuz thats the main thing I need at the cafe!  They also have ice cream which is a plus"}
{"text":"Once upon a time this place used to be a very slow and not so good coffee shop. In 2010 that place closed down and Coffee Culture took over. I frequent this place quite often and always enjoy the atmosphere when I go. The food and coffee can be very inconsistent which therefore dictates the 3 star rating. For the price they charge I would expect more  consistency. Other than that service is always great, the people who work there are very friendly and fun."}
{"text":"I have 4 complaints about this place.  1) It's EXTREMELY noisy here every night... the staff don't seem to do anything about all the noisy people that come in.  I've been to other coffee shops and the staff will kindly tell people to keep the noise level down to be considerate to the other guests.  2) It's very difficult to get a seat here during nights.  There needs to be more tables/chairs and individual work tables.  3)  The wifi is often very bad here. You would think since you require a password, it would be faster.  4) The coffee is great, but sometimes it's cold/lukewarm. The coffee here is more expensive than Starbucks/Second Cup/Tims, so you would expect to get an amazing warm coffee each time.    Other than those things, I love this place.  The café is renovated and looks much nicer than the other Coffee Cultures in the region, and the staff is friendly (but too passive when it comes to the noisy customers).  The food is great too."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere of this place! Very cozy place to just relax and enjoy a nice cup of coffee. The staff are very friendly and the prices are pretty decent.  Great desserts and pastries . Highly recommend the Cheesecake - the serving size is huge! My family usually gets 1 slice to share.. They have other meals [wraps, salads etc] that you can get combined with a drink and salad/ soup for usually under $10. But these are actually made fresh and served - not the pre made box stuff you get at second cup.  Theres also free wifi although the connection is not as great."}
{"text":"Slow service, never enough seating, and always short staffed for some reason.  Don't even attempt to order food here unless you want to wait an hour and have to remind the multiple times about your order!!!"}
{"text":"The coffee here is shit. Well at least they have a fairtrade/organic option. Better than Tim Hortons, but not by much. They always seem to mess up my order too. The guys who work here add a ton of cream w/o me asking and the girls usually assume I want it black (which is kinda flattering). The food looks gross and is way over-priced.  Nicely decorated though. I only go here when I'm too lazy to walk to Starbucks/Second Cup (Mississauga doesn't seem to have any other options, sadly)."}
{"text":"I have periodically tried this place for the last two years. Their wifi has never worked properly. The connection is either very slow or does not work at all. I have had issues when the place was packed and empty.   I came back today after a few months to give them another shot but encountered the same issue. There are three people using their laptops in here right now and the internet is very slow.    The coffee and tea game is getting more competitive. If you want to compete with Starbucks, McDonalds, Tim Hortons and Second Cup, you need to at least provide the basic necessities for customers to make your establishment an integral part of their routine. Great products are just one necessary part of the equation. You need to look beyond core offerings and give customers a reason to visit more often. If you are unable to even provide the same services provided by all your competitors, your days are numbered."}
{"text":"3-3.5* I'd say.  Quieter than Starbucks, more comfortable seating, same concept as Artisano/Panera.    Basically, it's a café where you can get work done - free wifi, catch up with a friend while enjoying a soup/salad/sandwich, or just sit for hours while surfing the 'net.  At first, I thought prices were cheaper than Artisano/Panera, but they're basically in-line.  I believe a wrap was just under $7, but to add a drink + soup/salad, it was +$2.50, so a meal with a caffeinated beverage is like ~$10.  Not too bad for a business person, but portions are just sufficient.  Roasted Mushroom Soup - Pretty good.  I enjoyed it.  Not quite a Campbell's Cream of Mushroom soup, but more of a creamy gravy.  Chicken Margherita Wrap - ok.  Nothing special.  Coffee that came with combo was medium and pretty HUGE.  I choose the Fair trade Organic and it was quite watered down.  A bit disappointing for a coffee joint!"}
{"text":"BUYER BEWARE!!!  \"There coffee in the morning is excellent. Goodbye Tim Hortons and McDs! Lattes are a nice treat as well.\" This was my initial post with a 5 star rating.  I have changed my rating to a one star today. The reason for the change is the poor business practice of this coffee culture. Today I went in to buy my daily coffee, and noticed the \"$5 bonus\" with a purchase of \"$25 gift card.\" Seeing that I buy a coffee daily, it makes sense to buy the gift card as I will get 3-4 coffees for free. While purchasing the card, I noticed the \"$5 bonus\" card was a separate card that looked different from the gift card. After hearing the cashier say it has no cash value, I then asked why is it advertised contrary to that. After telling her my daily ritual of buying a coffee, I had to specifically ask her how can I use this card. Her answer was that you should buy something over $5 so the card will cover some of it. In essence, this \"bonus\" is only useful if purchasing a $5+ item. There is no incentive for a daily coffee buyer to use it, as they feel like they've lost $5 minus the cost of the coffee (-$3).   Because of this gimic, I will no longer choose your coffee culture- and rather opt for a most trust worthy Tim Hortons."}
{"text":"The food here was alright, and the coffee wasn't bad, but I felt like the prices were a bit higher than what some may be used to.    I enjoyed the atmosphere, however I felt that the employees were a bit disorganized, and weren't very clear with each customer's orders.  I asked for takeout to only receive a plate with my sandwich.  When lines are long, they didn't call out what orders they were putting out and people would have to guess which order was theirs.  Overall, I think this place would be a lot better if the staff were trained more regarding customer interaction and clarity."}
{"text":"The coffee and the delicious menu are the reason I go to this place.  If the food wasn't good I definitely would NOT VISIT!!  Service is the worst. All three times I visited the staff at the counter have messed up my order. The first time angered me as when I told the girl she made a mistake she laughed and walked away. Seriously I could not make this up. Second time I asked for a tea stressed black no sugar or milk. Tea came with cream and sugar I'm allergic to cream. Yeah service is horrible but food is good"}
{"text":"Okay first, Yelp hasn't added the new location on Lakeshore just west of Cawthra, which is where I was this morning.   I'm giving it two stars because they do not offer free refills for patrons who stay. Both Panera Breads and McDonalds offer refills for customers who stay in the restaurant. Also the letters on their menu boards were so small I could not read them.   The atmosphere was okay and there is covered free parking close to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Not the best coffee shop but far from the worst. The dessert we got was decent. Generous size and not overly sweet. The wi-fi worked well, and the staff were pleasant. The tables are nice and big too. The only thing I really didn't like was the loud jazz music they had playing the entire time. It would be a nice place to work without that."}
{"text":"I am still having my latte and I just couldn't wait to yelp! I'm so pleasantly surprised with coffee culture. I heard good things and I'm glad to have come here.   The atmosphere is amazing with a nice blend of people. Never mind the actual reason for coming ... there is such a wide range of choices from drinks to sweets. We ordered a macchiato and a latte which were pretty good. The chocolate decadence was ok but I wouldn't order it again.      The location is convenient also. Usually I have to go pretty far to enjoy a cute cafe, (something other than starbucks, which I frequent regularly).  Currently the sun is setting, my chair is so comfy and I'm situated beautifully next to the fireplace... I couldn't be more satisfied with a cafe right now. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Ambiance is the first reason I go here. Double espresso shots are pretty standard. Their Cheese cakes are good! They have a wide selection of sandwiches, cakes and pastries.  Parking is ample at the plaza. I like the classy setting. I love the TV running in the background too.   Thumbs down for me is he quality of service. Their staff should have better training at communication, customer interaction, and avoid banging stuff when their working coz it echoes in the whole restaurant OR they can do something about the acoustic to drown out or tone down the kitchen noise."}
{"text":"Ambience is excellent 5 stars. Food is a bit let down when I compare with Lazaar. We ordered the coffee and spinach feta pastry . But loved to spend time for sure."}
