{"text":"Just saw this place for the first time while ordering my office Friday lunch. They had something for everyone. Ordered 2 bacon cheeseburgers, Philly cheese steak, catfish nuggets, loaded potato and steak and pulled pork sandwiche. NO COMPLAINTS! Everyone was impressed and talking about the food for at least an hour.. Great service too. Took a little to get here, but the employee was very respectful and had a great attitude and personality that you don't see too often. All in all, 2 thumbs up!! Definitely will be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"I tried too show them love and give them a few chances but they slow as hell 1st time my order took 30min 
Second time food was amazing just slow as hell 3rd times the chicken ain't have no seasoning"}
{"text":"Nice place, right off I-17. Amazing prices and a super friendly staff. I tried a few things. Coney island dog. Hot dog was real good with a snap. Also chili cheese fries. Both of these items were good. They use cheese sauce instead of grated cheese. The flavor was good but growing up real cheese that melts in to the chilli,  I would pay more for that dog and fries. Then I had the olive burger. This was the ticket. A taste I miss from back home. Everything was good from the patties to the bun. This was a real good burger. Everything is a good size at a fantastic price."}
{"text":"Delicious comfort food and the best customer service!!

The owners of this restaurant are some of the most genuine, humble, and sweetest people I've met in my life! They welcomed my husband and I the moment we arrived and we quickly had a great, wholesome conversation. It's hard to come by genuine people like this nowadays. We're new to the area and they truly made us feel like we were family.

My husband grew up in the Detroit suburbs and is a proud Michigander, so anything that represents or has some Detroit elements to it, makes him happy. I came across this restaurant, was surprised at the name, and knew we had to check it out.

Food - Great comfort food! Definitely true to Detroit flavors. My husband had the ribs and coney dog and loved it - he felt like he was back home.

Customer service - AMAZING! Like I mentioned, it's a family owned restaurant, led by a husband and wife team, and they're so sweet and friendly!!

Interior - Humble little fast food restaurant. What really matters is the food and customer service, and those two are on par!

Nothing like a sweet family owned restaurant!
There's a lot of heart in this business and we appreciate it so much. We loved our experience and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My husband is from Detroit and loved this place back home. I told him they're here in AZ now and he couldn't believe it. It made it finally and I could tell he felt like he was back home. I loved hearing him and the welcoming owners talk about Detroit and specific places only natives would know about. We live 10 minutes away and this will definitely be one of our regular places to visit."}
{"text":"Good people who own the restaurant.  Decent food at nice prices.  There's peach pop and peach cobbler.  . Try them out.  Their right off the I-17."}
{"text":"This place has it all

And I assure who ever reads this
You need to come here"}
{"text":"Had to wait 30 minutes for a coney that was just a regular hotdog that you can get from sonic for cheaper. Funny thing is that we were the only table there and it still took a long time to get the food out. They don't have it all the way together I would recommend going to a different place. Will not be back. They won't be able to last another year if they keep doing what they do"}
{"text":"As a semi-retired African-American chef, I enjoy supporting local restaurants of the same persuasion. However, I was disappointed my visit here. Having worked in restaurants from Los Angeles to New York, Hawaii to Alaska over my 35 year period in the culinary profession, I attempt not to be critical. I walked in on a Saturday night about 10:00. Only one customer, red flag. I was not initially greeted. I only live 4 minutes away. I saw they had a shrimp basket, so I decided to order one to go. I should have known when they tied the bag my order came in that something was up. The lowdown is, the shrimp were soggy and chewy, the fries were limp and under-cooked and I was given a piece of grilled bread that was undeniably stale. I was so mad at myself for not turning around the moment I walked in. To be fair, maybe they have some good items in the daytime, but this just was not their night and not mine either. I understand that people are in business to make money, but when it comes to the business of food, if it is not backed up with good service from the moment I walk in the door and quality food preparation, I would not recommend such a place to anyone. I really wish people would take the restaurant business more seriously. It's not enough just to think you can cook good and people will flock to your place. There are other systems involved in running a successful restaurant. I hope they try to do better because I just threw away $9.44. I should have bought some fresh shrimp myself!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time with this place! Dirty as hell.. they have what appears to be 12 year old kids working the register.. got a coney dog.. got my order wrong first then brought back a soggy coney dog on what looked like 2 week old bread.. the only reason they got one star is because they had faygo! Big let down for me as I got pretty excited about a Coney Island around the corner.. now this place was ever 5 stars is beyond me..Don't go.. how bout dat!"}
