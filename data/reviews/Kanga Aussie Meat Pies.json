{"text":"I tried Kanga pies a while ago at their original location and as soon as I saw them at their new location right outside the St. Andrew subway station (on my way home from work) I got pretty excited! They sell frozen pies for you to bake at home which is perfect for when you just don't want to cook! I love the sausage rolls too!"}
{"text":"YUM!!! This place has amazing pies. I have been to the original location but this one is perfect for me to grab a pie and salad during lunch hours or on my way home before I hop on the subway! I love the food and variety of options including sweet treats and the staff are super friendly!!"}
{"text":"The kiwi pie is so good! And so is the sausage roll! Note that the kiwi doesn't actually have kiwis in it.. it's minced beef with white cheddar. One pie is definitely not enough for lunch so you need more than one."}
{"text":"Picked up a Kangaroo Box for $10.50+taxes where you get a choice of pie, a roll and a side. As this was was for my daughter, these are a combination of her and my views. 

Most Kangas are a hole in the wall which suits me fine and perhaps their business model as well. When you pass by the stores you can smell the sweet smell of butter which does a trick on your stomach. 

Went for a Zucchini Pie, a Spinach and Feta roll and mushed peas for the side. The Pie was creamy however the zucchini didn't go quite as well with the creamy sauce within it. The pastry super rich and baked perfectly. The Spinach And Feta was the best. Small in size and perfect for a snack. The combination in the roll was great. The mushed peas are not popular I know and it met the expectations of why people not liking it. Perhaps Dried Peas with perhaps no salt or seasonings, it did little to add elevate the box."}
{"text":"Dude, I'm going to have a stroke.

This place is ridiculously good and this is the reason I'm going to get fat. Damn.
1 minute walk from my work is definitely not enough for me to work off the fattening delicious pies here. It's a small store and thank goodness there's never really a line. 

There are two vegetarian options for pies here - a zucchini one and the mates masala - CHICK PEAS!! I love the spicy indian flavours so I definitely go for this one. Let me tell you, the first time I saw this tiny pie, I was like .. wat. How is this going to fill me? ....I was very wrong- definitely very full after this and extremely satisfied. My mind drifted back to the thought of the masala pie for the next few days. 

I don't know why but I had the lunch deal the next time I went, which included a spinach roll and a side. HOLY SHIIAAAAT, the carb overload was insane. I can't deal. I was in a food coma for pretty much the entire afternoon and couldn't breathe for a good 4 days. WORTH IT.

Staff are super sweet too.

100% must go back and refrain from eating it every few days."}
{"text":"The place is okay.  I had the butter chix pie.  For one, the price came to about $7.75?  It is on the pricey end.  I doubt I would come here again, it isn't my type of food I would often.  It is a bit heavy."}
{"text":"Pretty good but on the expensive side given the pie size. I had the traditional pie and it was tasty and flaky. I also tried the curry one but it wasnt as good as the traditional."}
{"text":"Aussie meat pie was delicious so is the spinach roll !!! I went there with my MealPal subscription, normally each lunch costs 7 dollar with it. If I paid cash this 2 items would cost around 10 dollars, it is pricey but can be eaten once in a while. It is a small portion but because it is oily it is filling to the stomach. I ate the meat pie with ketchup like recommended and was yummy !!"}
{"text":"Another fatty meal but omg is it worth the calories. A big fat yes!  I love the kiwi meat pies from here. Always hot and fresh. It's a little on the pricy side for the portion but it's heavily goodness makes up for it. 

Just then pie itself will set you back around $8 and it's not filling. With the combo itll set you back $12.... still not too filling. Maybe I'm just a big eater but it'll last you till mid day then you'll have to grab a snack.

They also sell frozen ones 4 for $24. It takes 45-60 mins to cook... I most likely won't buy those as I have no patience. Anyways a must try but note there's no seating at this location."}
{"text":"Never had a fresh meat pie before, only frozen. Saw this stall and had to try it even though I thought it was a bit pricy.
The pie is the same size as a typical grocery store frozen pie, palm sized. I loved how each flavour had a different design on top. It's very cute!
The pie was very hot and came in a paper bag that soaked up a lot of its oil. It was very greasy, making my hands greasy holding it in its bag. The woman serving didn't provide me with any napkins.
The pie was pretty good but not mind blowing. I'd go back but to try other flavours."}
{"text":"My enough, but they really scrimp on the fillings it's more pastry than meat. I've always been left hungry. Not worth the price. The Pie Commission is much better."}
{"text":"I got the traditional meat pie and it was really delicious. Super meaty in the inside, and crispy, flakingy on the outside. The portion is quite small for a full meal, I'd recommend 2-3 for lunch. I had 1 after a huge breakfast and it was filling.

It's located in the path with a lot of other fast food options around. Not really busy here, and I can see that even if they get busy, the line will move pretty fast since it's just the cashier taking the pie out and putting it in the bag."}
{"text":"I got the Traditional Kiwi and the Canadian meat pie.  The Canadian pie was alright (slightly dry and the meats inside were too big) but the Kiwi was super good.  The Kiwi doesn't actually contain any Kiwis; instead it had ground beef and chunks of white cheddar.  I definitely recommend this one.

As others has mentioned, they're kinda small so get 2-3 if you're coming for more than a snack."}
