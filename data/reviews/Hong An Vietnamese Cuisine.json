{"text":"It's hard to find such an authentic Vietnamese restaurant in the SE-- I usually have to drive to the NE or 17th ave. 
My first impression of the restaurant was very positive. I was greeted by a friendly owner named Trinh. The decor is average but the food is fantastic!! I had the pho special and it was one of the best pho I've tried. The broth was delicious with a perfect portion of meat and noddles. I also had a mango bubble tea which was also very tasty! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great spot for Vietnamese food.   Everything is always fresh and very tasty.   Definitely one of the better spots in south Calgary."}
{"text":"The service was excellent.  The food was super yummy.  I got #38.  The meats were all flavourful and the sauces were good.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This location is under new management and has just renovated after being closed for two weeks.its now called Hong An.

I've posted this under add a business.

I've only had the Sate  beef submarine and it was delicious. I'm sure everything is good. I'll be back to try other menu items soon."}
{"text":"I like the fact that this place has No MSG in their food. Friendly service and good food."}
{"text":"Environment : Cozy clean place on 130th. The atmosphere is quite relaxed. Good for casual dining.

Food: The food here is always full of flavour. My favourite is their house signature pho. The pho is full of meat and vegetables. The banh mi are your typical Calgarian-Vietnamese banh mi. The vegetables tastes fresh and meat are well seasoned. I love their bubble tea! They use real fruit for their bubble which is always a plus! 

Service: It is always the same guy that is serving us, I think he owns the place. He is very friendly, always willing to help with your order and provide recommendations. The staff prepares the food very quickly and serves it within 10-15 minutes."}
{"text":"My new favorite in the area. So friendly and the food is delicious. I had charbroiled prawn and vermicelli and yummmm!"}
{"text":"Every time I've eaten here it's been a excellent experience. The owners are kind, friendly people who speak to each customer, thanking them for coming in. The food quality is high with great portions for a great price and it tastes delicious. I'm happy to see a quality Vietnamese restaurant doing so well, I hope they are around for a long time! 

Update: Hong An is consistently an excellent restaurant with quality food. When I was pregnant they steamed my sprouts without me asking (you should avoid raw sprouts when pregnant.) When my baby was a few months old I came in for lunch and the owners recognized me and were excited to see my son. Great owners and great food."}
{"text":"Busy, for good reason! There were no tables when I arrived but it was only a 5 minute wait to get seated. The reason for 5 stars from me is this: an entire section of vegetarian options! This is not normally the case in Vietnamese restaurants, so I was happy. The vermicelli bowl with vegetarian spring rolls was large, fresh and delicious. Also, 4 spring rolls! Yummm. They kept bringing us tea as well. Great service for how busy it was"}
{"text":"Had an amazing experience at this place. Their Pho is so light but rich in flavour with no msg added. Hope they keep up with the quality when they attract more business!"}
{"text":"I am not impress with their spring rolls that goes with their vermicelli noodles. Taste bland. 
My son ordered Banh Mi with white bread but instead they gave him brown crusty bread. I ordered Beef for my Banh Mi instead they gave me chicken. Their banh mi taste different from the previous ones we had. I guess they changed owner/management. Not flavourful as before. Sorry but this is my honest opinion."}
{"text":"Hong An offers a good selection of Vietnamese food, now I am no expert so I'm not comparing the dishes to much but I find them tasty and filling and they always satisfy my vermicelli or sub cravings. Located way in the deep SE it's a convenient location for me and I really like the avocado smoothie as well. Awesome owners who are super friendly and always have you leaving in a good mood, the decor is pretty basic but the place is clean and good for dining in or take out."}
{"text":"Me and my husband are regular customers at this restaurant and we can quite honestly say this is a fantastic restaurant. Everything from the friendly service to the amazing food is 5 stars. You will not regret visiting here. We both highly recommend it.  One of the other good things is this they do not put MSG in their dishes. Something that is hard to find these days."}
{"text":"I have my favorite Vietnamese places, but all are a drive from the deep SE. The places in this neck of the woods are ok, not fantastic. Well that all changed with my meal here the other day. 

I knew this place used to be a sub place but I hadn't been in this neck of 130th for awhile, lets be honest traffic is brutal and this might be the worst spot in the South trail area. But I had to visit another store and saw the name had changed so checked it out, and was happy I did! Great service, followed by great food with decent portion size, but the thing I really noticed was the quality of the ingredients. I had beef, pork and chicken on rice noodles and the meat was fantastic, thick and tasty. We also had spring rolls and again, very good. 

I will be a regular here, and can't wait to try the rare beef pho."}
{"text":"Finally a legit Pho place on 130th. Chi Lan handy been cutting it for ages. This is the new go to. Pretty clean dining area too."}
{"text":"Great food and fantastic service! Our dinner came out within 10 minutes of us ordering. I'm not sure if that's standard but we were impressed for sure. I haven't tried enough menu items to give it a 5/5. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Had a craving for some Vietnamese food, particularly some Pho, spring rolls, and vermicelli noodles! So found Hong An in the 130th SE strip mall surrounded by other food joints.

 The dining area is clean and the service is super quick. 

We ordered their seafood mixed rice, beef and spring roll on vermicelli rice, and Pho for dine-in. My hubby loved the seafood rice so much that he has ordered it multiple times for take out since then. And I have also ordered the beef and spring roll over vermicelli rice a couple of times for take out. Will probably try more things in their menu in the future.

Fast service, clean store, and great vietnamese food! Seriously have no complaints about this establishment and have been recommending them to friends and family that live around the area."}
