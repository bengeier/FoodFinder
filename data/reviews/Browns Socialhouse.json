{"text":"Generally very low quality of food and drinks. I asked for soup and specifically asked if it was made in house and was informed it was bought in. I appreciate the honesty but to serve canned soup at a restaurant...it shows the level of food quality served here."}
{"text":"Joined some friends for lunch and was impressed with the overall appearance of this establishment! The large windows and high ceiling make for a bright dining room! After being seated, our server greeted us and took our drink order. We were a bit early for lunch, the restaurant filled quickly as noon approached. The menu was varied as seems to be the trend with trendy dining spots. A \"specials\" menu was also offered. I opted for fish tacos and a pinto bean side. Pizza and a grilled ahi tuna sandwich were ordered by my friends. 

Food arrived promptly and was pleasing to the eye and ultimately the palate! The tacos were light and flavourful - filling enough! The pizza was good with a light crust - stole a slice for taste-testing. I think the winner was the ahi. It looked great, but there was no way to steal a bite! I definitely will try Brown's again and recommend it for a casual meal and drink!"}
{"text":"The hot wings were great. However dont order the nachos, they jip you on cheese and they just taste overall pretty old."}
{"text":"Very good place , and atmosphere , can get a bit hectic sometimes but the food is amazing ! Prices are kinda pricey for certain items but overall a good place to dine !"}
{"text":"Mixed drinks were horrible both times I went. Food was marginal. Prices okay. Expected more for a restaurant in Brittania."}
{"text":"My biggest concern about trying new restaurants is if the service is up to par with the food. These two aspects always go hand in hand when determining a good restaurant. Unfortunately, this was not up to standards. I've been here a couple of times before since I live in the neighbourhood. Its a great place to have drinks with friends or dine in for lunch and dinner. The food is amazing, and the atmosphere really does live up to its name of a \"socialhouse\". From the burgers to the tacos to the delicious desserts, just thinking about it makes my mouth water. Unfortunately, I can't say the same about the service. I've been there three times and one out of those three times I can confidently say our server was awesome. That's what made me come back again. However, the other two servers I had the next times were questionable. But then again, it is a relatively new restaurant and I appreciate them trying to do their best since it is still a learning experience for them. One time, I ordered a glass of sangria. The waitress said she couldn't find that order on the register so she brought me a whole pitcher with two glasses. I was surprised, and I thought it was a joke. I was thinking to myself that I was going to get drunk before the food even arrived. On multiple times throughout our dinner, we literally had to hunt our waitress down to get our orders even though there were other waitresses standing around talking amongst each other. And the food would arrive in 30 minutes. By then we would be starving. One waitress even stared at us while we waved our hands just to ask for another round of drinks. Service is questionable, especially when the same waitress who stared at me and my friends became my waitress on another occasion when I went with my family. She also implemented a gratuity of 15% before we even ordered. Thought that was odd since I was sitting with a table of 4 and it was never stated in the menu that service tax was applied. I wouldn't mind tipping well especially if our server was great to us, but our server was far from any little expectations we had. Rude, catty, and also hard to hunt down when we needed her for our orders. Hopefully this place will get better in due time. Would highly recommend, if you don't mind waiting a long time for your food and tracking down your waitress."}
{"text":"I love this place. Service is great, food is addictive, and the drinks are affordable."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch and was impressed to find they have lots of free parking located underground and we just took the paved alley behind the building to enter.
We both had burgers & the Caesars were excellent!  Friendly staff, took about 20 minutes for our burgers, and back to work within the hour."}
{"text":"I kind of don't want to post this review because this place isn't too crowded yet, and I don't want it to get popular! But I have to give credit where credit is due. This is a reasonably priced nice contemporary bar & grill. The house wine is a good choice. Attractive wait staff and good service. Good menu options and bar selection. I've got no hesitation recommending this place."}
{"text":"Been back twice since my first review, only because our friends wanted to go there. I still can't figure out why this place is so popular, unless it's because there just isn't much else in this area (?) 
My husband and I were both disappointed in our food at both visits. Just not much flavour. The calamari was totally bland and tasteless (did they even salt it?) and we relied on the dip to make it good. My fish tacos were ok, but maybe a couple ounces of fish for the $. I've had far better fish tacos at food trucks. I had a burger on one visit, and again it was not great. 
The one great thing is that the service was  better and the atmosphere seems to have improved, with a much more friendly vibe."}
{"text":"Good place. No ranch available for hot wings,even if you ask, no ranch! they offer blue friggin cheese. .. Wtf. Come on browns"}
{"text":"I went there on Aug.4. 
My first impression was not very good. I had to wait quite a while for the greeter and even asked a server if I should seat myself. The server called the greeter over and I noted she had been standing by the bar the whole while and was just ignoring us. Guess she was checking her huge false eyelashes and that was more important than customers.LOL
We were not asked if we wanted a booth or a table or offered an apology for the wait.
Not a great start.
However, the bartender came right over and proceeded to give us incredible service even though we had not been seated anywhere near the bar.
The food was tasty and came out quickly and was hot.
I had the chicken shrimp noodle bowl and recommend it if you like that sort of dish. The wine and dessert selections were more than adequate."}
{"text":"Great food!! I had the blackened chickened caesar salad. It was beyond delicious, real bacon, fresh guacamole, the chicken perfectly cooked. The burgers are great too, homemade and juicy. The service was also great. The venue is nice and cozy, very welcoming."}
{"text":"Browns is in the 17th ave SW area under the GoodLife Fitness. I went there on a Friday night as a group of 7. The front of house staff were welcoming and friendly and we only had to wait about 20 mins for a table..not bad at all for a Friday night and bigger group. 

It really feels like an upscale pub. I liked the seating and decor. There is a bar to sit at along with booths and low tables. It had a fun casual classy feel. The TVs are plentiful too if you need to keep an eye on game scores.

The menu had a lot of options that looked appealing. The quesadilla was delicious! I highly recommend it. The yam fries were scrumptious as well:) The Fish tacos were big and one of my friends really enjoyed them friend enjoyed them.

The drink choices were plentiful. Friday they offer $2 off martinis so obviously I had one. The basil grapefruit went down smooth, and the new mr. Pink is also a safe bet if you're into sweet drinks. They have $5 drinks all the time along with the daily specials.

Our server was nice and attentive. She was on top of our drink orders for the most part. The thing I appreciated about her the most is that she printed off separate bills with no issues! Thumbs up for that:)

Nice addition to the 17th Ave area. Great spot to have a few drinks, food and socialize:) I'll be back there soon!"}
{"text":"I've been to Browns on a number of occasions to meet work colleagues and find the bartenders are extremely rude and non attentive.  They look  unhappy and they make you feel like they are doing you a favour when they get you a drink.  The beer is also warm!"}
{"text":"Food is okay, not great, but I'll come back for something different.
I can't really judge it on two plates.
My buddy said the steak was good but a different flavour.
They really like to mix flavours up
Mine have pickled beets on a rice chicken bowl, tasty for the first few bites, but lost the appeal, and couldn't finish it.

Service was less then stellar, and unfortunately i reflected that in the tip. I'm not a fan of being left high and 'dry',' when I'm in the mood for a beer or two, as was my pal, who was only drinking, watered down diet coke, on propose i should mention. 

But will come back again."}
{"text":"In Calgary for work had dinner here on a Monday night. Had the fish tacos and the margarita pizza. The fish tacos were good, but the portion size is a bit small for an entr√©e, so I ended up ordering the pizza as well. The pizza was amazing! Thin crust great sauce and good and cheesy, fresh basil was the icing on the cake. Really great menu and always great daily specials. Monday pizzas were $11!"}
{"text":"Kind of an odd experience. Everyone else's food was great. But I had to send my Pad Thai back as the noodles were really under cooked. When it came back the noodles were still under cooked. The flavour was great, just the texture was off. I'd come back, but I would not order the Pad Thai again. Just order Pad Thai at an authentic Thai place, not here."}
{"text":"Yep.  

Two of us went.  It was really good.  Terrific atmosphere and service.  $4 beer and wine and solid food.   

We had pizza and a burger.  It was good.  


This place will do well.  Wish I had one in my neighbourhood.   Try it.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is a nice addition to Stephen Ave, if only to give one more bar to stop at for dinner and drinks. The first time I visited Browns it was packed full of people, which was refreshing to see because I feel like the current economic climate is taking its toll on some of Calgary's bars and restaurants, as people try to cut back on their spending. Browns is good, but nothing special. They have a giant menu that will satisfy most tastes, especially those that want a side of sushi with their pasta or chicken caesar salad, which surely must be someone. I ordered the margherita pizza, which was alright. I think the challenge with Browns is that by not committing to one kind of food, they're jack-of-all-trades-master-of-none. They serve burgers and tacos and pasta and sandwiches, and all are a-ok but none are truly great. Personally I prefer restaurants that aren't suffering an identity crisis, but it does make it easy to come here with a group when everyone disagrees on what kind of food they want. Browns has multiple locations around the city, so they're clearly doing something right. Of course, if you're inviting friends to meet you her, emphasize that it is NOT the shoe chain. When my friend invited me to Browns and told me there would be good food, I thought I was attending some special sales event with catering until I actually arrived and, alas, no shoes for me."}
{"text":"Weak start, middle & end

Rolled in around 11:00 am this morning for their brunch. Ordered 3 coffees that took between 10-15 mins before we got them. Our table was just about to walk out when our waitress came with our coffee an apologize profusely. So we sat back down and decided to give it one more shot. I order the fired egg sandwich. If you've had the egg sandwich from A&W it was the exactly the same! Head there and save yourself $7.00 and the wait. The waitress never came back once to top off our coffee. We had to ask when she was clearing off our table and we where done eating. We tried several time to get her attention in the half empty restaurant but she wouldn't even look over at our table. We ended up having to ask another waitress for the bill, because once again our waitress went missing. Probably wouldn't go go back for the brunch."}
{"text":"Decided to try out Browns Social House tonight with a couple friends. Ordered the Hollywood burger with fries, it was spot on! Definitely the perfect amount of food at a great price! Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"First review as yelp elite - thanks yelp team. I look forward to finding out what that means:)

I really enjoyed this place with three other ladies for lunch.great atmosphere the staff were friendly and there is an antique feel to the place. the food was excellent as well.I had The ancient grain and kale salad with grilled chicken added specially.

Free underground parking in the back for 90 minutes and an indoor passageway to get to the restaurant is an added benefit. I really enjoyed this experience."}
{"text":"The food was EXTRA salty... chicken wing dippins sauce was super salty. It made the water taste so fresh lol. Other then poor lighting the rest was ok."}
{"text":"Finely a decent place to eat in Chestermere. We been 3 times and all 3 times our food was great! Large selection of beverages they make a perfect mojito. 

The only downfall is they let kids sit anywhere in the restaurant when it large enough to keep families on one side. I don't go out to eat to here other people kids cry!"}
{"text":"A bit of a limited breakfast menu, but the food was outstanding. Steak and eggs was perfect and the waffles are deceptively filling. Staff was friendly and attentive. Manager was all over the place making sure everything was done well and that customers are satisfied. Would do again :)"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with the quality of the food served here. Many of the dishes I inquired about were not made in house.  The wine I had was very poor quality as well."}
{"text":"After a hectic day and a visit to the Easthills Costco, my family decided to try Browns Socialhouse. Are we ever glad we did! Everything from the atmosphere, the food and even the service was fabulous! 

We enjoyed the steak and sushi, burger and the Ahi tuna salad. All were prepared with care and delivered quickly and with great presentation.  The key lime pie for dessert was very sweet and a little gritty. I don't think I'll be having it a second time.

We will definitely be going again and again...even making the trip from Strathmore!"}
{"text":"Great location for a Brown's Social house. The Caesars here are fantastic. Spicy and well-balanced. I came here for some wings, which were....not fantastic. They were dinky and dry. The calamari dish was also dinky. Next time I come here, I am just going to order a bunch of Caesars and nothing else."}
{"text":"I went there for dinner.  I ordered the dynamite roll meal at $17.  That's the dynamite roll served with a salad.  The roll was slim and the portion of salad would barely fill the palm of my hand.  I am not a big eater but I was still hungry when I left . The server did not return to ask if the meal was good, just handed me the bill when I was done or I would have asked for something else. Based on this experience I would not return."}
{"text":"Today was my first time here - a suggestion from a friend. 

Last sentence first, I'll be back. 

I love a great steak sandwich but I was a little surprised by the price. $24.95 for a 5oz steak. I ordered it anyway - medium rare. It was amazing. 

I substituted fries from the Thai Chicken & Rice soup - also amazing. 

Out server - Taylor - attentive and never let my water glass get to empty. 

Brightly lit, comfortable seating, sports on the TV's...

Thank you. I will be back. 

PS: Change that 5oz steak sandwich into a 6oz steak sandwich and you got yourself five stars ;-)"}
{"text":"Brown's Social House is a typical chain restaurant with plenty of choices, lots of drinks on the menu, and enough variety that there is something for everyone.  I visited this location with a group of 12, and they were very accommodating with getting us in. It was a quiet Sunday evening so that helped.

The food was great. Almost 4 stars actually. I had the blackened halibut sandwich (listed under burgers) and it was so delicious. Others in the group enjoyed the crispy chicken sandwich, the fettuccine and the different kind of bowls. I can't say I'd recommend the steak sandwich, as it was ordered a med-well and came out med-rare. 

The service was alright, not great, but not terrible. The restaurant was not busy, but we were a large group. My one pet peeve about service is not coming back to ask how the food is, and that didn't happen here.

Overall, if you are hungry and wanting to socialize with friends, this is a respectable choice."}
{"text":"Went there with my friend on a Wednesday evening. The service was very bad. Not to mention the waitresses were hard core cleaning all the booths, letting the seats bang down after cleaning them. It was so weird. The waitress didn't come back, ever!  I had to go to the bar to order appys. Then, my friend couldn't get his beer refilled. We basically had to hold our hands up in the air every time. 

As for the food, the calamari was good and my friends' burger looked good. But the service was so bad, I don't think we'll come back. :(. There are way better places to go where the staff cares if you order anything."}
{"text":"Looking for somewhere quick, enjoyable, simple to eat on or around 17th ave? That's what we wanted and decided on pub food at Browns. It was surprisingly good for the price and expectations we had. Burgers and calamari were had and both were good. They have Monday night NFL special on their house Social brew and wine. We both had the brew and it was quite nice, especially being $4. All in all, good service, good food, good atmosphere, we would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Must try General Taos Chicken and the Ahi Tuna Poke. I've eaten here a number of times and the food and service has been consistent and good. The atmosphere is unique - a bar but classy food and decor. One of my favorite go to places."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on a whim and was presently surprised. Mimosas are $5 on Sunday and then I ordered a Margherita pizza which was quite tasty and I don't expect that quality from pub food.  My husband has wonton soup and said the broth was a amazing. I'd totally so in again!"}
{"text":"Came for brunch today. Beauty day out so we went for a walk to get some eggs benny. I really like this restaurant they just need better servers!! I ordered a mimosa and she brought water and coffee for my husband as I watched my mimosa sit at the bar for a good 10 min before someone (not our server) brought it over. Food was decent (always is) but had to track her down for another drink and more coffee (it wasn't busy either). I'm just a stickler for service. Booze is a restaurants biggest money maker so it surprises me with the lack of service. This place has great potential but it's just not their yet."}
{"text":"Browns Socialhouse's have been popping up all over Alberta, I believe this is the third location I have visited. The Mount Royal Village location is really well located just off 17th ave, it's close to other great shops and we selected it because Exit Calgary which was our next destination was right downstairs.

There's an entrance off the street but the restaurant is also connected to the rest of the shopping centre/business through the back so we didn't even have to leave the building to get to our next stop. 

I really like the house red, and for only $5 you really can't go wrong. We shared a selection of appies including nachos, quesadilla, yam fries and wings. Overall it was all pretty standard pub/casual food although the nachos were a bit smaller then we were expecting. The menu is the same for all locations though and they have some great entrees and street tacos that are worth a try as well."}
{"text":"Average at best. 3 stars are generous. The atmosphere is good and set up for larger parties Found the pub burger dry and a little on the cool side. And that theme carried foward to the poutine. Both the gravy and fries where on the cold side. I mentioned it to the server and she offered to replace my poutine but I declined due to the fact I was so damn hungry. For the price the food should have been better.The server  was pleasant. I doubt I will be returning."}
{"text":"Good location, good food, great beer selection. 

Had the Tahitian Tuna salad. Ahi seared rare, nice wasabi mayo and fresh greens. Very good!

Only thing keeping it from 5 star rating: the pretty disgusting cigarette butt memorial garden on each side of the front door. Hoping management sees this, cleans it up and splurges on a couple cigarette butt trash cans."}
{"text":"First time at this location.  The staff was VERY friendly and helpful. The drinks came out quickly (Caesars are SPICY - FYI), and the food was fresh and delicious.  I would def come here as it seems like a busy -hoppin' hangout. Lost a star for the music. When I arrive it was a loud annoying 50s...  Def didn't \"jive\" with the demographic or decor.  By 9:30 more hip music was playing.  *good save!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed every little bit about this beautiful gem!
Modern, with tall windows, full of light. Friendly and professional service.
Great beer and a super-yummy burger made my weekend very pleasant!

Go check this place out!"}
{"text":"My wife and I visit the Browns Sociahouse restaurant in Chestermere every four months or so. In the past our meals and service have been excellent, but not on our visit on 19 Apr 2018.

Our server was very friendly, professional and thorough, she was the only positive part of our visit. We ordered Salt & Pepper Chicken Wings for an appetizer, they were properly cooked and well plated but they were far too salty and were also spiced with rosemary, an unexpected and unwanted spice, I ordered salt and pepper wings and expected salt and pepper wings. Nothing more nothing less.

My wife and I then split an entree, we ordered the large size Fettuccine Carbonara with Alfredo sauce, bacon, sweet peas, blackened chicken and garlic toast. This entree has also been excellent in the past, but not this night. The entree included approximately 1/2 of a chicken breast, split between the two of us and the pasta barely had any Alfredo sauce on it. There was NO Alfredo sauce in our bowls and the pasta was barely coated. If I wanted pasta without sauce, that is what I would have ordered. I brought this issue to the attention of our server, she apologized and stated there were other issues with the pasta dishes coming out of the kitchen and she would have to speak to the chefs.

Last but not least, our favourite dessert, the Oreo Jar. Again this dessert is normally excellent, but this time the bottom of the jar was barely covered with oreo crumbs, which normally take up about a 1/4 inch or more. Overall the dessert lacked a variety of textures because of the lack of oreo crumbs.

We were quite disappointed on this visit, but given the track record of past visits, we will give this location one more try to determine if our experience was a \"one off\" or a sign of decline for the restaurant."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this spot. The tuna tacos were very delicious. The crispy wontons that were used as a taco shell were a nice touch. The blackened chicken Caesar was also very good. The blacken spice had just the right amount of heat and flavour."}
{"text":"Awful. Booked reservation for 6:30 to celebrate my sisters birthday, we arrived at 6:35 and our table was gone, the manager blamed it on a young hostess. Just not a great experience and not a great way to handle a situation. Probably will not return anytime soon."}
{"text":"My experience here varies depending on which server I get. I've had everything from excellent to I wanted to walk out. The inconsistency is disappointing. I usually have the halibut with the cowgirl salad - it's very good. I haven't found a good cocktail there yet. And once, when my server didn't come around to check if things were OK, I took a martini back to the bartender and she told me to take it back to my table and find my server. \"Nothing she could do about it.\" I havent been back to that location since."}
{"text":"Very happy that there is finally a good restaurant in Chestermere! Food has been consistently good since opening. Great drinks available and the menu is has lots of different options. The social sodas are delish!"}
{"text":"The fries and gravy are amazing as well as most things on the menu. Only food complaint is that I didn't love the sushi but that may just be personal. Some times that I've been the service has been a little odd. But importantly the food has been quite good!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing experience at this particular Brown's location. A group of 6 of us waited about 45 minutes for a table when we were told it would only be about 10-15 minutes (the restaurant was not packed at all). Once we sat down at the table, we waited for 20 minutes to get service. We tried to get the attention of the staff by making eye contact, waving frantically and even getting out of our seats to find them but everyone ignored us! It got so frustrating that we eventually had to walk and find the manager/hostess in order to get some service. When we finally ordered our food, one of the waitresses just dumped the food plates on the table and as a result, our food got sloshed around making the presentation quite sloppy. She looked unhappy and walked away without a word. The manager was very nice and did apologize for the service, offering to pay for our drinks. The drinks and desserts were ok, nothing to rave about. However, with such slow and bad service/mediocre food, I don't think we'd go back. Hopefully they will get a bit better."}
{"text":"Love this place. The staff are nice, food is fresh and delicious. My fianc√©e and I have it as a go to place on date night. No place is perfect but management has always always jumped in to be customer-first. 

Highly recommend a bite there."}
{"text":"Just finished up drinks with fiends. We watched the hockey game here. My friend at but I just drank. It was a great atmosphere and great service. The place is clean and the staff really seem to enjoy working here.  It's great here it's full of people my age and is a fun upbeat place"}
{"text":"Typical chain pub.

A useful addition to the neighborhood, but nothing special. Nice decor and atmosphere, with food of reasonable but unremarkable quality that's rather expensive. Decent drink specials, though.

And remarkably inconsistent (and too often awful) service.

Better service would give them three stars across the board."}
{"text":"the 4 stars are for service & 'ambiance', which were both pretty darn good! hostess & server were both really great, and I noticed all the servers at other tables were attentive to their tables too. 
we were in during Happy Hour on a Friday, and I wish we had just stuck to drinks instead of ordering food, because the food was really bland & disappointing. My mom was truly concerned 'I think the chef forgot to season this? should we say something so he doesn't send more out like this?!' No mom, we shouldn't. Next time we will just come for the drinks, which is ok by me!"}
