{"text":"Very new restaurant in an under serviced area for Asian food. Clean decor because of this. Good staff and decent food. 

Unfortunately, in my opinion, from all my years of eating traditional northern Chinese cuisine, it misses the mark. Especially the beef noodle soup. The broth wasn't \"thick\" enough and wasn't spicy. The beef was a tad too lean."}
{"text":"Large and clean restaurant.  Went on a Thursday night.  About 20% occupied.  Only one server and she was very nice and pleasant to deal with - probably the nicest service I've received from an Asian restaurant in a very long time (she smiled!!).  

However, the food isn't that good.  The XLB (xiao long bao; soup dumplings) had no soup.  It was super dry and shriveled.  Shanghai fried noodles were decent.  Onion pancake was dry.  Fried tofu wasn't crispy and lacked seasoning.  Pan fried dumplings were also dry.

Too bad food wasn't better or at least par with Asian Legend.  I'd probably go at least once a week if it was better."}
{"text":"Didn't get to try their specialty:  Peking duck.

After waiting for 30 minutes for our orders, we decided to just leave.

Came in on a Saturday evening, at 75% full capacity, yet with only ONE server employed!

Bad management."}
{"text":"Pros:
Large seating area
More servers working now

Cons:
Peking duck not done well

Chef Quan used to be NCE BBQ and when I went to NCE, it was very good.  Sadly to say, Chef Quan does not carry the torch.  It's basically the same restuarant but the food quality has gone down dramatically.  It's not horrible, but it's definitely not as good as it was before.  

We came here last year for Chinese New Year last year and since it was very good, we came back again this year.  Even with the name change, the menu and decor remain exactly the same.  We basically ordered the same dishes again; the Peking Duck and the Shanghai Think noodle.

Unfortunately, the Peking Duck, which is their signature dish, was not done well at all.  It was carved pretty poorly. If you look at the pics I took, the pieces barely have any skin on them.  Places that carve the duck well carve it so that most pieces have a good amount of skin on them.  Our pieces and had little to no skin on them.  It looks like they conned us out of some so the skin too.  There's no way from our pics that that was all the skin on a whole duck. The Peking Duck wasn't bad per say, but it was nowhere near as good as it was last year. We also ordered an add on to the Peking Duck which never came at all.  When the bill came, they did charge us for it but at the very least they took it off when we brought it to their attention.  

One of the things they have improved on is having more servers working.  When we came the first time, there was only one server working for the entire restaurant.  Needless to say, it was very slow.  There were 3/4 servers working this time.  So at the very least, Chef Quan has this going for them.

Overall, Chef Quan was a disappointment because we had the same expectations for it as NCE.  I totally recommended NCE to anyone for Peking Duck in the past.  I can't do the same for Chef Quan."}
