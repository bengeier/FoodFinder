{"text":"YES to Perogies for lunch! Coworker was mentioning a very good Ukrainian restaurant close to work and we had to try it! The location of Ukrainian Fine Food is very odd, in the middle of the industrial area but that is what makes this place a hidden Gem!! Tucked at the end of the street is a small shop that serves one of the best set lunch for an amazing price! 

I ordered combo #1 and it includes cabbage rolls, perogies, and Kolbassa. I added sour cream and fried onion. You have a choice of fried perogies or steamed and I like the skin to be a bit crispy so I got fried. 

The portion was pretty big for $9.95, and the perogies were absolutely delish! Kolbassa was also very good with lots of flavour. The cabbage roll has rice and small pieces of beef inside and ties the entire dish together! I was happy I added sour cream as it adds a bit if a creamy texture to the whole dish. 

I highly recommend this place to anyone who works close by for lunch!"}
{"text":"Pretty good typical Ukrainian food. I had the platter ? It consisted of perogies, cabbage rolls. and kolbassa sausage. Real Ukrainian cabbage rolls, are apparently the small ones. The ones they serve here are large. (I prefer the large ones). 
You get a good portion of each of item and I for one was quite full.
The funny thing that I noticed upon entering the restaurant, was how the door handle is mounted on the outside. It's mounted backwards lol. I tease my wife, that is part Ukrainian. I and my boys just look at her and say \"It must be a Ukrainian thing\" 

Anyways give a shot if you're in the area its not too bad."}
{"text":"Don't expect to be served, linen table cloths or fabric napkins but UFF will remind you of a visit to Baba's.  Fill up with a combination plate of perogies, a cabbage roll and a piece of kobasa.  My mother was convinced it was all health food and who am I to argue?"}
{"text":"In 10 years nothing seems to have changed. In this case, its a good thing. 

UFF a good \"mom and pop\" restaurant where their lunch combos are just variations on the serving sizes of cabbage rolls, kolbasa, and pierogies. They do a daily special and one or two soups. There's other things on the menu here but I couldn't even tell you what they are because you're coming here for the cabbage rolls and pierogies.

The combos will run you $9-12 so once you add in a drink lunch will cost $10-15. Not as cheap as many fast food places, but you'll have a full belly thanking you for skipping the crappy fries and burger from the drive-thru."}
{"text":"I cheated on my Celiac's and begged my husband to take me here. I guess being gone for 2 years either resulted in their food changing or my taste buds changing. I was quite disappointed that my cheat was this place."}
