{"text":"Very good pizza, pretty basic, no bells and whistles or modern/gourmet pizza, just good, classic pizza pie. The rest of the menu is a bit limited, but if you're just looking for pizza, this place is a good bet.  The greek salad is also pretty good, heavy on the feta and black olives, which I love, and onions, which I don't, but are chunky enough to be picked off. If you are having a party for kids, you can go for the huge take out rectangle pizza, but I wouldn't order that for adults (as most pieces are inside slices, without crust)The restaurant itself isn't much in the way of atmosphere, so we've done take out, or in years past delivery.  If you want take out pizza in Mint Hill, this is a great alternative to Hawthorne's. And it's nice to support a local, small business."}
{"text":"I went based off a recommendation from a friend. Our friendship is now in question.  It was flavorless crust and sauce and the cheese was cooked to a crisp.   Maybe it was because I had such high expectations in my head that this fell short.  Even ordering a specialty pizza didn't turn out the way I thought."}
{"text":"Great, fast delivery with very courteous drivers. They're always within the quoted time, usually early.   The Big Slaw subs are insanely good. We haven't had anything we haven't liked. I do prefer the subs to the pizza but that's a personal preference. I always opt for sammies over pizza.   There's a lot of variety on the menu as well. They're our go-to pizza place."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Mint Hill.  Family owned, friendly staff and inviting atmosphere.  Sports TV in the background, and be sure to order the chicken wings while you are there!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Big Guys since I was a kid. Their pizza always delivers in terms of flavor and their staff is like family. They remember our order just by my name on the phone! I recommend getting slices, and bacon is a great topping. Keep it up Big Guys! You rock!"}
{"text":"This pizza parlor offers friendly service. They have a HUGE 28' pizza for large parties. And there is a big checkerboard with rocking chairs so you can play while you wait on your order!"}
{"text":"Went to the website and ordered a family calzone and had an option to do half vegies and half none vegies, to my surprise i get a call 15 minutes  after ordering i get a call from the staff telling me we cant do that weve had to many complaints about the contents of one side mixing with the other. i was under the impression that a resteraunt was suppose to make the customer happy and learn how to be flexable and consistent. Ive been a customer for a year, ordering at least 5 times a month i wipe my hands of this establishment and suggest and much better pizza place by the name of serafinas"}
{"text":"Best Pizza in Charlotte or anywhere for that matter! Love this place! Family owned, local, sweet people and most of all...great pizza!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten many pizzas in my day and this by far the best in Charlotte... Being from from NY this was just like being home again... Kudos to the pizza chef...."}
{"text":"The pizza is great. NY style pizza and for a decent price. It isn't too greasy. To eat in the restaurant is obnoxious. The employees yell at each other constantly and the wait for a pizza was an hour long wait. For the restaurant. It was shorter period of time for carry out (only 30minutes). I don't understand how customers in the restaurant wasn't a priority.   The restaurant itself was clean and decent size. Had a good bit of tables. Reminds me of a mom and pop place."}
{"text":"Not fancy, not pretentious, just good old fashion NY pizza in a casual setting. Good food,good people."}
{"text":"I don't know what you people are thinking but as a NY resident this is NOT NY style pizza by any stretch of the imagination. First of all don't go in there looking for a grandma or Sicilian slice because they will look at you like your crazy, they literally said they don't know what that is! Also I went in  at 700 pm one night to give them a second chance and I asked for 4 slices to go, they told me they only had 2 and they weren't making anymore! I was shocked! What kind of pizza place that doesn't close until 9 doesn't make another pie? The taste is bad, the service is bad, and it is not NY style."}
{"text":"I love love this pizza!  I guess I'm partial though since it is just like the pizza I grew up eating in little towns in Maine, New Hampshire, usually owned by New Yorker transplants.  The crust is crusty, the sauce is delicious, and the pizza tastes awesome!  The restaurant is family owned and run and you can tell they put a lot of love into it! This is my favorite pizza in the Charlotte area hands down!"}
{"text":"Had a hard time placing order using a coupon. They claimed they didn't have such a coupon. I explained where I got and, read the coupon and gave them the December expiration. They finally took my order. When I picked it up,the price was higher than is should have been. I had him read the coupon. He tried to justify a higher price, which I would not pay. He finally charged me the correct price. Not worth the hassle."}
{"text":"OK, it was a Friday night - but when I placed my order on the phone @ 6:20PM I was told 45 minutes to an hour. I arrived @ 50 minutes later, paid for my 2 plain cheese pies and was told they'd be ready in a few minutes. By the time 1 1/2 hours had gone by since I placed my order, I would have simply left if I did not already pay. I watched numerous people walk in and pick up there orders as well as a family that came in after me, sit down order and get their food before I did.   Anyway, the pizza is good - but that was the worst wait I've ever had. If I had gone to Hawthornes, they would have given me a discount or even free pizza as they value their customers. I will not order on Friday from Big Guys EVER again."}
{"text":"Just grabbed a early dinner at this place and it was excellent. I had the mozzarella sticks which were very tasty and not over battered and a slice of Hawaiian pizza. This place has the largest slices of NY style pizza I have ever come across in the Charlotte area. The pizza they cut them off of is a huge 28\" pie and pulling just 8 slices from each pie makes for some gut busting eating. Also, the slices themselves only cost 3$ for the cheese and for another 50 cents each you can add toppings to make whatever combination you'd like. I know its NY style but I usually like a little extra sauce on my pizza but irregardless it was still awesome all the way around."}
{"text":"Ordered lasagna and it was yummy.  I was not sure getting lasagna from a pizza place but it was filled with cheese and rivaled my homemade.  Everythung I ever got from here has been really good."}
{"text":"Wow. Trust me, even I am bummed I have to write this review. But this was hands down the -worst- pizza I've ever had... and I love pizza madly. I decided to give Big Guys a go tonight and ordered their 18\" veggie pizza to go. The wait was standard, about 25 minutes, which I didn't mind. Service was decent. I grabbed my pizza while still hot outta the oven and took a peek in the car to soothe my hunger pangs... and dammit I was instantly disappointed. The pizza was undercooked all in the center, complete with soggy canned toppings and cheese that slid right off. I tried to make some excuse to avoid marching right back in...solely for the fact that I was SO hungry. But after my quick arrival home I realized all hope was lost for this pizza. The pie was so soggy it would separate from the center when pulling a piece from the box. On top of that, there was no flavor at all. Did they even put sauce on this?? Papa Johns down the street does a better job, and that's unfortunately saying a lot... first and last dollar ever spent here. Would NOT recommend!"}
{"text":"The pizza has really gone down hill. The dough tastes of cardboard and the cheese is cheap. The sauce taste like vomit. I am very disappointed to have this restaurant in our community while the food is just horrible. We will not be using this restaurant ever again."}
{"text":"They have great Pizza, almost like New York Pizza. I always order the large pizza to go. I am so glad I found a place with good pizza. I don't like chain pizza to much. I have tried thier spaghetti and meatballs, they are not that great, the meatballs have no flavor and the pasta had too much water in the bottom on the plate. I just go there for the Pizza."}
{"text":"Wow!!! do not waste your time on this place! They advertise that they are the best pizza in Charlotte, yeah probably within a 1/4 mile of their location and that is something I would contest! The staff is rude and the food is horrible. Do yourself a huge favor and go ANYWHERE else for pizza in the Charlotte metro area. If I could vote less than one star I would, they do not realize that they are in the service industries because it seems they could careless about pleasing a customer! I have worked in the service industries all over the East coast and have never seen such disdain toward a customer."}
{"text":"The pizza isn't the best in the south hills, but it certainly isn't the worst. The cheese and sauce is decent, but the dough is average. As a previous review stated, the garlic knots are fantastic. They give out a TON of coupons, which definitely keeps me going back. If there were no coupons I probably wouldn't come here. If you live in Bridgeville you should get the Valpak coupons, which you'll always find something from Big Guys."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town. Big slices, friendly service. Plus, they give back to the community which is a plus in my book."}
{"text":"Still catching up on reviews. This was a hard one to rate. Yelp should add half star options as I feel it deserved better then 3 stars but not 4 stars.  Folks are very nice. Service very slow. I mostly get take out orders from them while asking 'how long', depending on the time of day, before In should arrive to pick up.  They normally say approx 30min.  Wanting my food hot, I always get there at 20-25 minutes as Id prefer to be a tad early and wait a couple minutes, leaving with hot food, rather then arrive with my meal already done and just sitting on the counter.  Yet every order I've placed has taken over 1 hour. Many of these orders are at times where I am literally the only customer, in between lunch and dinner. Nobody eating in and nobody other then me picking up takeout.   Thankfully the folks working there are nice, so I at least can chat with them as I wait, rather then staring at the walls.  On to the food. Pizza. Not bad. Not NY Style, but closer to NY Style then others.  Sauce had good flavor.Decent crust. Overall 4 stars on the pizza. If your expectations are reasonable, you should enjoy the pizza.  Wasnt overly impressed with some of their main dishes. Pasta was overcooked and watery in every pasta dish I've had (pasta should be al dente...cooked just enough to be firm). Flavor was very bland on not only the pasta, but the main dishes as well. If your expecting garlic, your wondering where the garlic flavor is. Pretty much the same with all their dishes. Just bland....Nothing that says 'great, cant wait to come back'. Just ok. Portion sizes are fair, but overpriced comparing to others establishments. If the dishes had great flavor and weren't so hum drum, the prices would be fine, but you cant give out small portions, lacking in quality and flavor and expect to charge 4 or 5 star prices.  Its strange that the pizza/sauce has good flavor, but for whatever reason, the main dishes lack that flavor.  The Subs again, disappointed. Not bad, but again, overpriced and nothing to get excited about. Prices are about $7 for a basic 8inch sub with cheeze. Tomato and all other toppings are .75 each. Add 2 or 3 toppings that are typically included in most subs and your now at $10 for an 8inch sub, that is still more bread then meat/cheese/toppings. Lots of places have 13inch loaded monster subs for less money. A $10+sub should fill you up. A $10+sub should also be 13inches and filling. $10+ for an 8inch sub that will leave you hungry is just not right.. The bread is good, but for the $'s, they need to have a better bread/meat/fillings/toppings ratio. I love good bread. But I dont want the bread to overwhelm the meats, cheeses and etc. Again, charging 4 and 5 star prices, should deliver a 4 or 5 star product.$10+ for a small sub is absurd. Id be happy with the 8inch, and even at $10+, but it would have to be fully loaded and filling. Paying $10+ dollars for a sub that is small, more bread then anything, that leaves you still hungry is unsatisfactory, imo.  Overall, I guess 3 stars is fair. The folks are nice, so 4.5 stars for that. The service is way too slow so that gets 2 stars (if your not busy and have employees walking around acting bored, why does it take over an hour to get a pizza?)  The pizza I give 4 stars. Not the best, but pretty decent.    The main dishes and subs are about 2- 3 stars at best.  If in the area, I wouldnt hesitate  to rec stopping in for the pizza, but its not worth going out of your way for. Lots of good pizza places popping up, and Mint Hill is crazy. Its Mint Hill after all, yet there seems to be good quality pizzeria's popping up all over the place.  And if in Charlotte/Matthews, there are plenty of pizza places as good/better and cheaper.  So, if your in Mint Hill, try it out and compare to others. If you find yourself there at lunch, maybe stop in for a couple slices. Worth trying if your close, but not worth going out of your way for.  Happy eating..."}
{"text":"Good pizza - one of our favs, but the Wizard of Oz meets Cracker Barrel decor is a little odd for a pizza place :)  Still, the food is great and the portions generous. Buy it by the slice or the whole thing - it's good either way."}
{"text":"Staff is always helpful but the pizza is so greasy and not worth the prices they have. Would rather go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time with a $4.99 large cheese pizza coupon for pick up. There is no dining area, so it's carry-out or delivery only. The pizza was average and I didn't regret paying $4.99 for it, but once I got it home, I had to add garlic powder and oregano to jazz it up a bit. As someone who tries to avoid salt, I was surprised that the crust actually needed some because it was very bland. The staff was very friendly. I'd go back, but only armed with that coupon first. If I had paid full price, I'd be a bit disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. Great ny  style pizza. Great owners and staff always friendly I live in rock hill now and still drive down here for good pizza."}
{"text":"We haven't ordered from here in a while but decided to try it today for lunch. There's no other description other than it was disgusting. The steak was a soggy mess with brownish lettuce and no flavor at all. The pizza was small in size for a large (perhaps they make their pizza smaller when using a coupon). It too barely had any flavor. Maybe with a good buzz it would taste good. The garlic knots weren't anything you would impress a date with either. Total waste of money and back to my go to pizza shop. I'm sorry I strayed from them and I'll never cheat again."}
{"text":"The pizza is delicious, great sauce and thin NY style crust (I'm from the northeast). The mozzarella sticks are also really good. A little pricey, but worth it. Ordered delivery and it didn't take an obscene amount of time."}
{"text":"Absolutely The best pizza here in Charlotte! We would rather drive there to get pizza then have it delivered from anywhere else! Absolutely positively worth going! The friendliness of the staff plus the flavor of the pizza makes it an incredible experience. Definitely worth going!"}
{"text":"The 28 is great!!! Always a huge hit at every gathering that we host or attend. The 28 is a great conversation piece due to its shear size and great flavor. I would say the pizza is close to NY style. I am a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Being from New York I'm definitely a pizza snob - and a lot of places down south can't come close to what I consider real pizza. Big Guys is an exception. Their pizza is spot on - great crust with a slight crunch, the perfect amount of cheese and oregano melted on top, and most importantly it doesn't just drip grease when you pick it up. In the never-ending search for great pizza down south Big Guys should be one of your first stops. And don't be surprised if it's your last too!!!"}
{"text":"100% not impressed! I got Chicken Parmesan, which comes with a side of spaghetti and 2 garlic knots. The spaghetti was so watery it was like they didn't drain it after they cooked. The chicken parm was tasteless and bland I have never had such unflavorfull Italian in my life. My mom got a Stromboli which was great till the end the last part was so hard it could have broken glass. I will not be returning to Big Guys and I don't recommend it."}
{"text":"I walked in not knowing what to expect and was greeted by smiling faces. They ladies working were the ones making the pizzas. One chatted with us while we waited for our meat pizza. She was really funny! The pizza was SO good. Perfect amount of cheese and meats. Not too much sauce. Crust was crispy. I will be back very soon!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a party pizza and a supreme for the Super Bowl.  Was absolutely fantastic.  Can't wait to go back for more."}
{"text":"Rounded up to four yelp stars!  This place would be hard for me to give three stars and the ONLY reason I will not eat here again is because I like some (not many) Pizzas better!  They beat all the Chains unless \"Fuel\" is a chain!  The Marinara Sauce is FANTASTIC! !! !!!  An  easy 5 YELP STARS!  The Garlic knots were A-OK not very Garlicky 3.25 yelp stars  The Pizza was good - I had an 18\" Cheese - The cheese is Mozzarella (YAY no blend!  I do not like most blends).  Almost 4 stars!  Everyone working here is very friendly and seemed to be Happy to be working on a Saturday night!"}
{"text":"the pizza was okay , I had better like Brooklyn pizza . The staff over charge my mom for the lunch special . I don't know why she didn't say anything about it . But  we wont be going back , We will stick to Brooklyn Pizza"}
{"text":"I found myself very disappointed for the price I payed for what I got....and its a rip off to order from this place. The food may taste good but its far from reasonable to feed a family."}
{"text":"Big guys pizza just keeps getting better and better. Been coming here for years as a south hills local and love this spot. So many creative pizza and Hoagie options to choose from. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I live in New York, which is not exactly hurting for great Pizza places. Still, Big Guys was something special. The modest storefront does not let on that these guys use very high end ingredients, and hand make the sauce in house. I was surprised how good it was! Among the best I have ever had. I  also dug the wings but get the Buffalo flavored ones. Nice and tangy."}
{"text":"Better than other local pizza places I have ordered from. We ordered a large and it was enormous! Cheese is good and crust is delicious. The pepperoni were not that great. The mild wings were tiny and dry. The cheese sticks were obviously made by hand and they were quite good.  It all came out to $33 and I think that is a bit much, however the Large sized pizza was a feast for 3 people.  Overall, if we have a hankering for pizza, we will order a small pizza from Big Guys Pizza."}
{"text":"Love the pizza and had the Chicken Alfredo tonight and it was great. Huge portions and fresh salads. Once we ordered an extra large pie(not knowing what we were getting ourselves into) and it was so huge the box wouldn't fit through the front door! We had pizza for days.."}
{"text":"After an afternoon of shopping,  we proceeded to take my sons friend back home.  It was supper time so we offered and he accepted and had not tried Italian out.  So we search Yelp and found this spot which was on the way.  It's a nice family owned place that was comfy and roomy inside (5/5).  The decor is sparse but not in a negative way.  You place your order, get your own drinks, sit and wait for the food; piece of cake.  We ordered the lasagna with meat sauce; 2 orders of the spaghetti with meat balls; and a 14 inch cheese lovers pizza.   By all accounts the food was good (4/5).  Few negatives include the spaghetti sauce being a bit to watery and needing a bit more salt, and the garlic knots being just a tad doughy.  Other than that, shark eyes all around. The lasagna was flavorful and the cheese pizza was amazing...the cheese tasted sooo buttery!!  Hold on while I regain my composure .  Also had to take a pic of the largest pizza I've ever seen.  Just a monster!  The gentleman could just barely get the box through the door!  We recommend you try this place and we would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Really great NY Style Pizza!  I'm an NYC resident, and this pizza is just as good or better than the best NY Pizza.   Super friendly service!    Their large pie is 28\"!"}
{"text":"You want big this is the place for you. You can get a pizza that will cover an entire folding card table and it's not just a novelty, the pizza is actually good. They don't deliver that far and if you have large group somethings things take longer then they should."}
{"text":"Only reason I give 4 stars is because I am from Chicago and Chi Style pizza is the best. Very good NY Style pizza, there aren't many good pizza places in Charlotte, this one is good trust me. You won't be disappointed at the end of the day that's what you want in a pizza restaurant. The ladies were very nice to me as well."}
{"text":"This pizza is outstanding. I love the big slices, and it tastes great. Pricing is great too. Sure, you could get another pizza from a chain for $5, but then you've set yourself on a dark path of bad decision making. I usually get the standard: a large cheese pizza. It's great. I dream of the party-size pie.   I always get takeout, so I can't speak to the in-restaurant experience. However, for takeout, this is the only pizza I'll get."}
{"text":"The food is great, the service is AWFUL. The children that answer the phone are rude and lack any understanding of customer experience. We loved this local business however, will NEVER be a patron of this pizza joint again. \"Mam that's not my problem\" \" do you think we just want to hold your pizza here\" Brittany Sucks"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I'm not a fan of their pizza...   Everything else is awesome, especially the garlic knots! They also have an online ordering option, which is great. Pricing is pretty fair too. I order from them often, and they always get my order right."}
{"text":"Do not order the Grandma Pizza! It was the worst pizza we have ever eaten! Hidden under a glob of cheese and too much oregano you will find canned tomatoes that will slide right off the pizza! Zero flavor and super greasy! We could not eat it and ended up throwing the pizza in the garbage. The only pizza worth ordering is the white spinach pizza. The regular pizza sauce they use taste like something straight out of Domino's. Very disappointing for New Yorkers we will never go back."}
{"text":"Since moving to Mint Hill two years ago, we've ordered take out pizzas here many times.  Their pizza is now one of my favorites.   We've ordered the Supreme which is really good, but I think my favorite is the pepperoni pizza, it is soooooo yummy! I've also ordered the antipasto salad which was also really good. Haven't tried anything else yet but plan to  If got haven't tried Big Guys yet, I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"With a slew of franchise pizza places in the neighborhood,  this is a really good pizza spot. Pizza is always good after ordering here several times. They never disappoint"}
{"text":"Pizza is ok, not at all great. The garlic knots are ok, but the sauce is sweet and too greasy. The atmosphere is stuffy cluttered. They have Christmas decor in June. Just very odd in my opinion."}
{"text":"Great NY slice! The sauce is very flavorful, which can't be said for a lot of CLT area sauces!   Looks like plenty of other dishes to choose from. I look forward to trying something else.  Family owned, friendly staff! Good for dine in or carry out. They do have a delivery area as well. Several craft beers and the regulars in stock as well."}
{"text":"Nice people but the food needs work. Pizza is average at best. Nothing original about it. Calzone had way too much ricotta. And the wings were not crispy and so so."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been to Big Guy's - and over two years since my original review - so I figured it was time for an update (which means another visit, and a slice of their most excellent pizza pie!).  I'll have to start with the atmosphere, because there isn't much.  I hate to say it, because I really love Big Guy's, but it's in a strip mall, and the grocery store closed, so it doesn't even have that going for it.  There was one place near Eastland called Chelsea's (which is now closed) that was in a strip mall and you'd never have known it.  Otherwise, if it's in a strip mall, you generally know it.  The kitsch around the place is still there.  If anything, there's more of it, even if there isn't as much as a Chili's or Cracker Barrel.  And there isn't quite as much that's focused on the Wizard of Oz.  But there is a guy who performs live once a month (or so) now.  But the atmosphere is still a bit sparse.  This is made up for by the fact that the staff is more friendly than just about anyone you'll ever meet, but it's still sparse.  On to the food - it definitely hasn't changed for the worse.  If anything, it's better.  While our kids have decided that they like some pizza other than cheese and pepperoni, and they love the size of the pizza from Big Guy's, they prefer CiCi's and Pizza Hut right now, so we don't get to go as often as I'd like.  That means that I was able to dig into a large slice and some garlic knots.  The knots were light, and the marinara sauce was great - but there didn't seem to be as much garlic as I remembered.  Meanwhile, the pizza was excellent.  Unlike some pies that will suffer from sitting out waiting to be reheated, the slices at Big Guy's don't, and come out of the oven crisped to perfection.  Unfortunately, I still can't seem to make it past the pizza, so I can't say if the other items on the menu are any good - but I have no doubt that they will be, if I ever make it to them."}
{"text":"Cheese pizza, Pittsburgh steak hoagie, and buffalo chicken roll - all very good!  Got a medium pizza for two people and it was smaller than we thought...just FYI in case you're hungry!!"}
{"text":"Good stuff. Could use some more toppings, but I got an extra large pizza and garlic knots for $14 and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Located in a strip mall within Mint Hill, NC, plenty of parking available.  Casual pizza establishment that is family owned.  Staff is always helpful and welcoming, decor is quaint. Staff always recognizes me, as I work in the area and visit for lunch fairly often.  Eat in or carry out available.   They offer pizzas, calzones and multiple Italian dishes.   I recommend calling ahead for carry out options.  For the Super Bowl we ordered the 28\" Big Guy with Pepperoni.  We had the pizza sliced Into 16 slices instead of the normal 8.  NY style pizza with the right amount of seasoning, tasty sauce.   Everyone at our SB party was pleased with our pizza!  Give it a whirl, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Good and dependable family pizza spot! Come here often carry out and eat in with family of kids. Great service and food. Try the buffalo bites if you are skipping your diet!"}
{"text":"Big Guys is another place that is a go-to for my mister and I. It is located near our home, and we probably order carry-out at least once a month. Our order is the same every time: a large cheese pizza. The pizza has a great thin dough with a bubbly crust. The sauce-to-cheese-to-spices ratio is perfect.   Wait, scratch that, we did order a party-size cheese pizza once and it was ginormous. The box barely fit into the trunk of my Prius. There was left-overs for days. It was glorious!"}
{"text":"We have been coming to this strip mall area for a couple months now and decided to try this place since I love pizza. The prices aren't bad for what you get. We ordered a Calzone (it was huge) and an 18\" veggie lovers pizza. Heavy on the veggie lovers cos this pizza was loaded"}
{"text":"This place continues to impress with it's pizza. I'll say it is a little pricey but it's worth it. Ordered a 14\" pepperoni to go on Friday night and thoroughly enjoyed it. Nice crust and great flavor."}
{"text":"Decent pizza...but honestly NOT a fan of the oversized slices...like seriously who wants a super sized slice?  rather have two normal size slices...overpriced for sure."}
{"text":"This was soooo good!  The pizza crust was crispy on the bottom but not burnt.  Perfect sauce and the toppings were so good.  I got a supreme pizza with pepperoni, Italian sausage, bell peppers and black olives.  There was so much flavor on this pizza.  I ordered the 18inch half without cheese.  I would eat in, because it is best fresh out the oven. A little expensive for great quality pizza."}
{"text":"Okay...We could be onto something here!  1st time and went with the old faithful Pepperoni it was good but then as daddy's do...I ate the plain cheese pizza that my kids did not finish and I had to stop, go back and eat another of their pieces (they just love when I eat all the pizza ;)  The cheese has a chance with me. The sauce is simple but pure and does not have a lot of spice to it. They serve the NY style big slices (which I'm not a raving fan of in general) but this one was pretty good...yes I used a knife and fork to hack off the bottom part but either way. It was good ZA and I'll be back.  I'm not sure where this falls on my Pizza list for CLT yet but I will update."}
{"text":"Love this place. This is a must when in mint hill. Huge slices with huge flavor. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"The best NY style pizza south of Brooklyn! The party pizza is a sight to behold and is enjoyed by anyone whonhas tried it."}
{"text":"Finally, found a new pizza place in Mint Hill! It's probably been here awhile, but I never tried it until this weekend. They have the huge 26\" pizza, which is great for a party (box barely fits through the front door - reminds me of Jersey shore boardwalk pizza). We got the wings dry, with sauce on the side and they were great. For the amount of food, and quality...it's a win. Delivery was fast as well. Good find..."}
{"text":"First - Big Guys in Mint Hill has great pizza. Really great pizza.  Wings also good here. Staff has always been very friendly. I've never eaten in but we get pizza/wings for take out all the time. It is slightly pricey when you get into adding lots of toppings but just cheese pizza is great. Really no complaints.  It's my choice of pizza places in the Mint Hill/Matthews area every time."}
{"text":"Got the party-size pizza. It was enormous! Very tasty! Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"When we first walked in, it wasn't as inviting as we'd hoped for it to be family owned. I like the old country/southern decor, it's nostalgic for the rustic lovers.   On the contrary, the slices are NY style. It was a tad too greasy for my liking. By the time I got to the crust, I forgot how greasy it was. The crust certainly tops this bite off right!   If I'm in the area again, I'd give them a shot to see if perhaps our timing was not inviting. Restaurant is good for the locals in the area wanting a NY slice conveniently."}
{"text":"This is strictly based on delivery and take-out.  Pizza and I have a tumultuous relationship.  The standard fare (Pizza Hut, Papa Johns, Dominoes) is exactly that; standard fare.  Blah and yuck and I'd rather spend my money on a good sushi roll.    My husband, on the other hand, can eat pizza 'round the clock.  He introduced me to Big Guy's and I've been sold ever since.  It's the only pizza I want.  And notice I said \"I want\" instead of \"I'll eat\".  Not many pizza places have left me wanting pizza but Big Guy's nailed it.  Their dough to sauce to toppings ratio is on the mark as far as I'm concerned (er... and I'm no pizza aficionado but still...).    They're a little pricey but not out of the ordinary leaving out the \"buy 2 deep dish pan Sicilian stuffed garlic cheese crust pizzas and get a free abysmal side\" types.  They've nailed it and as far as pizza goes, I'll have nothing less!"}
{"text":"Used to live down the street and ordered when I just couldn't get anything else. The food was mediocre to poor. Pizza was often burnt and hoagies saturated with dressing making for soggy buns and heartburn."}
{"text":"Pizza is fantastic and very authentic. The wings are pretty good, too. Then only issue we have had is with the heros/hoagies. The quality of the bread is not the best. They need something more dense for their meatball heroes, as they will fall apart. The ingredients in these heroes have been good quality, however."}
{"text":"I am convinced that NY pizza can only come from NY. \"Big Guys\" should change their name to \"Rude Guys\". The staff was rude, inconsiderate, and wished they were somewhere else. The pizza was a pathetic attempt at best. Soggy, limp, with very little flavor. The pasta was a joke with sauce from a can (if it was sauce) and bland. All in all there are a lot of other places to go for pizza that don't include a bad attitude. Give \"Big Guys\" a big \"No\"!"}
{"text":"The food is great, the service is horrible. I understand that it's a Mom and Pop place that employs high school students and maybe family members, but the service is slow and disorganized whether in house or delivery. Great news for them, food is great...I wish they could figure out how to train staff that deals with public."}
