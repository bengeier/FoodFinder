{"text":"pretty awesome place.  A lot to do and it's good for adults and kids.  My son, wife and I went to hang out with friends and had a blast.  Bowled the best game of my life!  130!! haha"}
{"text":"Second time coming here and it was so much fun! Ryan was the best bartender and was so friendly! Will definitely be looking for him next time we come back! His drinks were on point and he took great care of us! Bowling was fun as always and playing laser tag was the highlight! Fun run in around while having a great time!"}
{"text":"Very good local place for a family night out with a mixture of food, beverage, bowling, arcade, and laser tag. Hard to drag my son out of here and only issue is I don't see this as a competitive bowling alley. Now a days the alleys are trying attract as much attention as possible so it makes sense but true bowlers may want to go somewhere else while I feel this is more of a family fun night out. I still give 5 stars as I realize I am giving the cranky old man review, Get Off My Lawn!, as Uptown does bring a nice change to Surprise for all families."}
{"text":"So disappointed in their specials. So anytime they \"advertise\" a special you have to ask for this specifically. For example, Sundays they have their Red Zone special! Well you better ask for this, otherwise you will spend twice this amount on bowling. I was told the employees are not allowed to advertise this, you have to find out by the advertisements in the establishment or online. 

I have been disappointed in the time it takes to get service around the establishment , unless you go to the bar. I have been visiting uptown alley since they opened. It's close to home, they show sports on the big screens and all around the place. 

Don't be in hurry when you go for dinner. We asked for a Coke 3 times and we never got it. 

The manager did offer a discount on our food so that was nice. However I am all about customer service and would have preferred great customer service vs the service we received."}
{"text":"Good \"all in one spot\" for eating, bowling, and playing arcade games... even picking up a drink from one of the bars. Movie theater is close by as well."}
{"text":"Went bowling today for my son's birthday and was disappointed that they refused to acknowledge his birthday. The counter attendant told me they could, then after discussing it with her co-worker she said no. Bowling alleys are pretty popular places to have parties - you'd think they'd want to make it a pleasant experience. Won't be celebrating here again."}
{"text":"Can I give zero stars? Hours of operation on the website and door say open at 8 am on Saturday. Well it is 9:15 am and I am standing outside with my husband and kids and the doors are locked. I saw a man inside so I knocked, he motioned to me that it would be a minute. 5 minutes later and no one has come to the door. First time coming here and it is now my last. What a shame."}
{"text":"Wow!  Happy hour wings are the best!  Nachos portion is huge and great price for what you get.  You may need to keep on your server cause it's a little hectic in there but happy hour is the way to go here... My kids love the lazer tag and video games!  Not bad for little Surprise ;)

Don't expect the waitresses to be quick.  Ours was very slow."}
{"text":"We bowled here early Saturday afternoon. No problem getting a lane, but when we left, the line was almost out the door. 

When we arrived, there was a line and only one cashier, you would think on a Saturday that they would have more staff at the register and less at the shoe return counter. The drinks were a little pricey, but it was a fun place especially when this is one of the very few attractions out in Surprise."}
{"text":"This place is like a dave and busters on steroids, like a costco size building but has a bowling alley, restaurant, VIP bowling area with pool tables, they have nice furniture, HUGE tvs, good background music half the time.  One time I came in and they were playing stupid 80s music.

I've been here 3 times now and every experience with the food has been very good.  Their appetizers are half off in the afternoons and considering the taste/cost ratio during happy hour you can't beat it. However, I wouldn't ever pay full price for their appetizers. The beer is half off too, you can't beat a pint of beer on tap for $2 with some excellent wings. This is the best thing that happened to surprise since Buffalo wild wings shut its doors. This place would be great for a work party or birthday party.

This place puts AMF and brunswick bowling alleys to shame. This is the only place to go to for fun in surprise, you'd have to go further beyond surprise to do some clubbing/bar scene. This isn't the place for that. 

It gets 4 starts because they lack something hugely fundamental. They have a descent range of drinks to choose from, nice furniture, but did not seclude the adult bar/vip room enough away from the kids. the adult bar area is very small but nice and is open with kids running and screaming by. 

The vip room has djs and music/sometimes even live music which is okay.

The bottom line: Overall, if you're looking for a friday night to chill with your bros or your girlfriends, and looking to do something different go for the appetizers half off before 7, and drinks are half off too this is a great place to hangout, if you're looking to do something entertaining and not in the mood for going to a full on bar."}
{"text":"Currently at uptown as I write this review. Came from California to attend a friends wedding. While killing time waiting for our suits to be altered we thought we would kill time and go bowling. Upon arrival we we met by Jim. He helped us with laser tag and once we exited he had brought us waters. He also told us about the current deals and helped us with getting a lane and shows to bowl. Simple gestures but made the experience worth it. Customer service is key and Jim has great customer service."}
{"text":"What a cool place! I was hesitant in going at first.  However, my hesitation was almost immediately put to ease!  From the moment we walked in we were met with smiles and wonderful customer service. Not to mention the great interior design of the place.  We had a delicious dinner accompanied by tasty drinks (the bar tender definitely was not stingy on the alcohol) and with happy hour prices all night long our wallets weren't hurting either.  After dinner we spent the rest of the evening in the VIP lounge.  It was really busy with lots of younger kids, so it was nice to have a separate, more quite area to bowl and hang out.  I would absolutely recommend going to Uptown Alley and look forward to my next visit!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome to hangout with friends/family/dates! Ryan G. made it super fun and we want to come back again! He gave us great info and was nice enough to let us know of the 2 dollar Tuesday specials they have here!  Thanks for a fun night Ryan G.!"}
{"text":"I have been going to the uptown alley for a few years.  There are two people that have always gone above and beyond to make each time a great experience. One is our bartender Claudia.  She has always been extremely friendly, fast and efficient.  THANKS CLAUDIA. The other person who goes out of his way to give great service is Jason in the bowling area. He always gives great customer service and makes it a fun bowling experience.  THANKS JASON. Our family truly appreciates all you do"}
{"text":"Best bowling alley ive ever been too. For a bowling alley they get 5 stars plus they have some pretty amazing food. They also have servers for the bowling floor which is neat not having to go up to some bar every time you want a beer. Big tvs everywhere and nice draft selection. The order of wings you get is huge and there are like 3 bars."}
{"text":"Love  this place! It has a restaurant /bar 
( red embers)  to the left when you walk in. To the right are the arcade games and laser tag..walk straight through and you get to the bowling alley that glows in the dark, to the right of that is a 21 and over bar/bowling alley with couches and High top tables ect... There's also another bar just outside that tucked between the bowling alley and arcade.. Food  is always  amazing.. my favorite is the chicken and vegetables... It has  grilled chicken, asparagus, artichoke hearts , red and green peppers,onion and lots of yumminess. ..... Bonus  for me is that there is karoake with a live band on Thursday nights .amazing sound system and the host is a favorite local entertainer/singer that makes it extra fun. Yes... I love this place!"}
{"text":"Uptown Alley is a great place but my food was served cold ...all 3 dishes.  Not happy about that"}
{"text":"Great fun. Great food. Outstanding service. Tyler and the entire staff crew were first class, and they keep the whole facility in very nice condition. Well done!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the best places in the valley to bring the kids and watch a football game.   The kids can play laser tag, video games and bowling while you enjoy the game on humongous projection screen. Good service and decent food."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of Vegas! Except without slot machines lol. When you walk in the lights are shining and the games are playing from the arcade. 

Very kid friendly and let me tell you, they are running a mock! I sat at the bar and was greeted promptly, I ordered a Rouge Dead Guy Ale (one of my favorites) and enjoyed the hockey game playing. After my second beer I decided to order. 

The bartender guided me around the menu and I started with the egg rolls which were very tasty with the sauce. I then ordered the spicy bacon burger (with the mango habanero sauce on the side). Once the burger arrived I was thanking myself for putting that sauce on the side. Holy cow was it SPICY! The burger tasted fresh and was very impressive! The bartender continued to check on me and made me feel very welcome. 

I gotta say, I will be back here again!"}
{"text":"Location was accommodating. Service was horrible!! Food was mediocre at best. Managers are never around. Over priced for really poor service!!!  We waited 45 minutes for our pizza and one hour for chicken strips!! Never going back!"}
{"text":"The waitress had made a mistake with the bill. No big deal right? Or at least I thought. Instead of asking us to pay the difference the manager tried to have us pay the entire bill again and said the first bill would credit back in 3days. I explained that would not work but they kept pushing to pay two tabs over 150$. At that point I checked my account and found a separate charge for another 25$. When I asked them to explain the charge and provide a receipt, the manager said it was just an accident and could not provide proof or reason for the charge and just said we will credit it back. So after they mess up the bill and \"accidentally\"  charging another 25$ the only concern they had was to get the 45$ they messed up on the bill. As I tried to get more info as to how this happened, the manager exact words to me were you're not in the right state of mind for him to explain. They tried to steal 25$ and his answer was to insult me. This is a shady business and you should be careful giving them credit/debit cards especially with large kids parties like we did. Obviously they see this as an opportunity to exploit and cheat there customers. I personally will never attend this Establishment again"}
{"text":"Im so glad this place opened up so close to my house! It has bowling, lazer tag, a good arcade, pool, darts and more. Its a super fun place. Its pretty clean, very modern and just a nice place to chill and relax. 

Cons- Need more pool tables. 
The dont allow inside food or drinks in which is SUPER annoying.
The polices are just to strick. 

But overall i think uptown alley is an awesome place for anyone. Im so glad it came to surprise :)"}
{"text":"Uptown Alley is a great and fun place! But when it comes to service it isn't that good. We ordered some wings and we weren't sure how much came whit them so we asked the waiter and he said it comes with eight. When we got it there was only four! It was ether they messed up the order or the sever didn't know what he was talking about!"}
{"text":"Our first time to the Red Embers Bar & Grill. We were looking for a cold beer, and got much more. Great burgers, great service from our server, Forest. We had a great time. We will be going back."}
{"text":"A very fun place. Food is very good and the service is great. The bowling is very fun, if a bit pricey. The arcade is also fun for the whole family."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of the food BUT I've been going here for the past two years.. what keeps me going back is the bartender CLAUDIA! She's fast, friendly, efficient and always has a smile on her face."}
{"text":"Their appetizer prices are getting as high as main course meals and the happy hour menu keeps shrinking. Bring lots of money it goes fast here."}
{"text":"This place is hopping with a great night life atmosphere and even private area for adults only if you want to get away from the kids for a while. The best place to watch any sports with that JUMBO screen.  I'm not much of a bowler but the gaming and luve bands are awesome.  Thanks for the good times."}
{"text":"-Food:  Awful.  There is nothing positive about the food.
-Service: Problematic.  Waiter not very knowledgeable of activity wait times and his food suggestions were lousy.  The wait to get someones attention just to put my name on a list for bowling was ridiculous.  Not sure who was running the front counter.
-Bowling: 3 hour wait.  Found another bowling alley in the West Valley.

I was incredibly disappointed with my first experience at Uptown Alley.  I might try again in a year or two...maybe for my kid's birthday.  

Having the bowling wait time posted or, at least, let the waiting staff know so they can encourage the diners to put their name on a list would have been helpful.  Our waiter had no clue about the wait time.  

Hopefully their problems can be sorted out."}
{"text":"Went here in a last minute whim on a Saturday night. The bartender was nice but they definitely need more help back there! I waited super long and the drink was ok. We bowled a few games and the waitress we had was good but again this establishment needs way more help! They had a live band playing and they were phenomenal! Will try to check them out again and see how the service is."}
{"text":"I regularly bowl in Sun City West but our lanes are closed for maintenance so I decided to check out Uptown Bowl. Big mistake to try and practice on a weekend. First, it was very crowded so I went into the lounge area (21+) and there were lanes available. Very nice for a party but not a good way to get your practice in. Lanes are dark so hard to see your mark and the screen reflect on the lane. But in was very nice in there. Great place for a date night! Drink was tasty but a little over-priced.

The regular lanes looked good but, again, the reflection from the big screens could mess up your bowling. Looks like a great place for families. Not sure what the crowd would be like during the weekday. 

All in all, didn't love it nor was it a bad experience. Next weekend I will get my practice in at a more traditional bowling center."}
{"text":"I order some soft pretzels and they were anything but soft.  Apparently they don't care how their food goes out."}
{"text":"Nice Spot for entertainment Bowling , Food and Drinks service seemed to be quick and professional. I plan to revisit again"}
{"text":"Rating the Restuarant at the Uptown Alley only. Went there during midday, about 2 pm. Service was very good. Drinks were filled quickly. Servers were very friendly. Appetizer came out with the meal, but both tasted delicious. My main reason for dropping a star was for the quantity of food compared to the price. $16-18 a plate and not a lot was delivered. We ordered the dinner salads and chips and guacamole. The quality of the food was excellent. Overall I'd say you are paying for what amounts to servings half of what you could get at a place like Red Robin or Chili's. The atmosphere and service are excellent."}
{"text":"This place tries to cram too much under one roof and they don't do any of it well. If you want to bowl go to a bowling alley. If you want to eat go to restaurant. If you want video games go to game works or castles and coasters.  If you want to pay too much money to do all of that under one roof then come here."}
{"text":"My husband and I thought we would check this place out on one of date nights. We went on a Saturday night so it was pretty packed. We walked in and saw a band playing. Acoustics were terrible. Couldn't make out at all what the band was playing but I'm guessing that it was bad 90's music. Once we squeezed ourselves through the crowd to see what we could do we saw that it was a pretty big place with screaming kids running all over. Tried to get a lane to bowl on. Was told that it going to be OVER a hour wait. Ok, that's fine. Its a Saturday night we figured, so we went to the bar to get a drink. Took forever just to get the bartender's attention and the bar area only have 5-7 people in there! Once I did get their attention I asked them to make a drink, but they didn't have apple schnapps to make it with. Okay, well I was just about to order another drink when the woman WALKS AWAY to go talk to the other bartender there! Just WOW. That was it. And I wasn't about to try to wait another 10 minutes just to get their attention again while they had their personal conversation. So we walked out of the bar DRINKLESS. We left right after that. Maybe we just didn't go on a good day, but we were pretty disappointed by the whole thing."}
{"text":"Our service was very good. We ordered a hamburger pizza and they were delicious. Our server had great customer service. They didn't screw up one of our orders. She removed it from  our ticket. We told her that was not necessary we ate them and we would still pay for. She brought us the correct order. This really is good customer service. I thought the games were expensive but the kids enjoyed themselves. It was clean and it was friendly. We would go back again thank you uptown alley for having a clean place and people with great customer service."}
{"text":"Best place to hang out. Fun bowling and laser tag for the kids. Yummy, yummy food, and some interesting beers on tap 10/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for something like this to come to surprise and was real excited to take the family and friends there when it opened.  Went a few days before the actual grand opening and had a good time, but my mood instantly changed when I went out to get something in my truck and came inside to a \"bouncer\" telling me they were at capacity.  When i told him i had family in there he made me seem like a liar, and he wanted me to call my girlfriend to come to the front just so I could go back in, not a good way to start your business.  

So I thought what the heck lets try it again another weekend, so last weekend I went with some other family to show them how nice it was, I mean they have TV's everywhere an awesome arcade, and even have a 21 and older section for after 8pm that has its own lanes, bar, pool table and DJ booth for the weekends, and it doesn't cost any extra which is kind of cool.  First thing when we walked through the door was another \"bouncer\" telling me they were at capacity and they had a 2 hour wait, when clearly i could see from the door there was open seating EVERYWHERE and there were many open lanes.  After about 15 mins of waiting in line I asked the lady if I could use the restroom, she told me I could go next door to the movie theatre and use there's because she didn't trust me that I would come back from theirs.  AWESOME SERVICE!!! (sarcastically speaking)! 

I would give this place more stars but the service and people are terrible!! The food was good and bowling was a little overpriced but your paying for luxury pretty much.  

If they wanna stay in business they need to work on their customer service...ALOT... maybe start by getting rid of the stupid \"were at capacity\" thing when your not even close to it! 

I'll probably wait a while before I go back"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time ever.
Was impressed with everything. Customer service was amazing as staff interacted with us to assure we were taken care of throughout our stay.
Bowling, darts, pool, video games, live band, multiple large screen tv's and a restaurant.
Nice place."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been to this location before quite a few times with ok results. The last couple of time we have had some problems. The Uptown alley website tells you about these amazing bowling deals from 10pm - close you can bowl with shoes for $10 on Thursdays. That's great lets go do that.. Oh wait you have to be over 21 to get into the premises after 10 pm, It doesn't say anywhere near the deals anything about this age restriction, You have to hunt for it at the bottom of the page in the smallest writing they have on the whole website. We tend to go to other bowling alleys now, The music is always extremely loud and the screens above the lanes are usually playing sports on most of them, Not music videos or something worth watching. Wanna watch the game? Go watch it in the bar area with all the other fans."}
{"text":"Went bowling there for the first time Sat night.  We were charged $51 for 1 hour of bowling and two pair of shoe rentals.  A bit excessive in my mind.  They do not allow you to pay by the game after 6PM  WTF.  Our ball return jammed about half way through our time, It took at least 5 min to unjam.  We did not receive any extra time to finish our games.  Music was much tooo loud.  We prob will not be returning."}
{"text":"Best place for a date or for family day! I love it here! The food is awesome and the people are always so nice!"}
{"text":"The food is decent but A little pricey. The bowling is good and it's a nice environment but they need to update their shoes. My kids had shoes That was either too tight or too loose because the Velcro are all worn out."}
{"text":"We had a mid afternoon bowling trip here because we were in town for a funeral and our server Jayme was awesome!!! We needed to release some stress and from the moment we walked in she directed us to a lane that we could be some what alone and was very prompt with or order. Also our drinks were never empty, she was always there at the right moment to see what else we needed. We plan on coming again when we're in town."}
{"text":"My kids always have fun here. We have had planned parties and they always are amazing. They value military and have special events and pricing. This place is fun for adults and kids and is a monthly staple for my family."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming here for a little while now and we love their happy hour. Well drinks and select drafts are $2 along with half price appetizers. The bartenders are pretty awesome and pour some strong drinks.

We have had most of their appetizers. Our favorites would have to be: meatball sliders, turkey/bacon sliders, southwest rolls and cheese curds. I personally have never had real cheese curds so I'm sure they don't taste like what most people are used to but I love them. Then again who doesn't love fried cheese?"}
{"text":"First time in tonight! Greeted by nice hostess and seated quickly at a booth next to the bubble wall! Yes a bubble wall! It's neat it changes colors the kids loved it. They have a good happy hour menu Monday - Friday. DJ night is Friday Saturday nights. The regular menu had a variety of food wings to burgers to salads something for everyone. Our server Tori greeted us right away and got our drinks quickly. I order the Cobb Chicken Salad with the balsamic dressing. My husband got the Cheese burger sliders (server offered it as happy hour price which came with fries vs no fries which was a better price so good for her for giving her guests better options) all the employee working hard. Angel was busy getting heaters going carrying  trays of food just really working hard it's nice to see employees working and not just standing around. As a restaurant manger when I dine out I always admire employees working hard vs leaning hard. Our food tasted great food was hot my salad was cold and crisp. After dinner we headed over to the arcade part! The fun part! If your a first timer you pay $1 activation fee for your gamer card but it gives you 5 credits. They have various packages that gives you credits. Their prize area is reasonable for the amount of tickets you earn. We didn't do everything Uptown alley has to offer like Laser Tag and Bowling but we look forward to coming back and blowing a few games and shooting it up in the laser tag room. You should be proud of your staff and give a shout out to Angel ,Tori and your hostesses for making our experience great. See ya next time Uptown!"}
{"text":"This place is beautiful and family friendly! However service is really slow and prices are steep. It's a nice place to go every once in a while or for a birthday."}
{"text":"Wow the place is huge, pricey but set up is legit and clearly bowling and laser tag are taking new leaps for the west valley. This place has arcades, live bands, laser tags and of course the bowling lanes.  I am not much of a bowler but the lanes are really nice and there is a designated area for all ages and then there are those for the adults.  This is really nice for the adults because you can have a great bar to yourself and the food is very good.  We ordered pizza's, wings, and mozzarella sticks which all were very good for a bowling shop.  

For those businesses looking for a conference room, they have them.  I have not looked into pricing because my office is so far from this place, but I will share they seem very state of the art and are large enough for a good size group."}
{"text":"Been to Uptown Alley about half a dozen times so far.  Several times meeting up with a small group of friends, and a couple times on a date night with my husband.  

WELL...cannot speak on the bowling alley part since we haven't been able to get into a lane due to the wait times.  But on the upside, we were able to get some good food and enjoy the company.  

Highly recommend this as more of a \"grown up\" place to hang out if you want to eat too....there are LOTS of people there on any given night and food choices can get expensive (in addition to shelling out for video games) for kids (ours are 19, 15, 14 and 9).  

Our favorite night to go is Thursday nights.  From 1500 (3 pm) until 11 they have HALF-PRICED appetizers and $2 domestic drafts.  My husband and I stopped in twice on thursday nights and had amazing service, not as busy as \"usual\" and we ordered (3) of their tasty appetizers and a couple beers a piece.  It came out to $26...WOW!  THe food was hot, fast and fresh.  Bartender (Claudia) was very friendly and attentive.  

We watched pre-season game on their wall of tvs and had a really nice date night (within a tight budget this is awesome!)  NOTE: Thursday night is also Karaoke night which is cool if that's what you're there for, but you can hear the singing (howling in some cases) in the entire building so it kinda put a damper on trying to watch the game and catch whatever Olympics events we could see.....BUT we did hav a blast overall and it didn't dent the wallet! lol

Only negatives I see at this point are: limited and expensive food options for kids, forever waiting line for bowling (a bummer if that's what you came there for)---will have to update when I take the kids in for video games and paintball.....

Overall, a great place to hangout with friends or honey for a drink and a quick meal.....WE plan on being regulars (on thursdays)....especially after checking out a movie on date night!"}
{"text":"I Love uptown Especially Miss Makaela. She seams so dedicated to her work, always is on fleek, and hardly ever see her not smiling . She is the reason i keep coming back . Well that bartender claudia is fantastic also . She always makes my drinks just right :)"}
{"text":"Food seemed very good. Drinks came quickly and were good. It's very loud - but it is in a bowling alley so to be expected. Good place for late nights in Surprise."}
{"text":"Great place to have fun. My one complaint is that waitress rather clean off tables than take ur drink order. Telling me to wait. When did it become ok to ignore or put cleaning a table before a paying customer? Priorities are all wrong. I blame the mangers because it's lack of training. Can't expect $8.00 an hour gal to have common sense or courtesy. Hope this review gets to management and correct this issue ASAP!"}
{"text":"I don't leave reviews often but I received exceptional customer service from Jessica so I must share my experience. 

My family and I went to Uptown Alley for dinner and drinks. After being seated by the hostess, we were a little upset that a server had not come over yet to take our order. After about 15 minutes of waiting, we decided to move to a booth closer to the bar section, assuming service would be better there than the section we were originally seated at, which was all the way in the back of the restaurant. 

After 5 more minutes of impatiently waiting, I went up to the bar and was greeted by the bartender Jessica. I told her what had happened and she sincerely apologized and assured me that she will be taking care of us the remainder of the night. She promptly brought us our orders and was very tentative and friendly checking up on us very often. We were beyond impressed and pleased with her amazing customer service. She changed our entire experience and we will very likely be dining there again soon. Thank you Jessica!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here to grab a quick lunch before a movie. The poor bartender/waitress was slammed, but as soon as she saw us, she came over, took our drink order and promised to take our food order as soon as she finished closing out one of her tables. That's exactly what she did. I have nothing but respect for someone who is obviously super busy, yet still tends to all customers.  I wish I remembered her name because I would give her a shout out here and thank her. The food was good and the service was great!  Thank you"}
{"text":"What an awesome place! Yes service is kinda slow but..the patio is nice & they have a lounge kinda bar with a DJ! The food & beer were good & not over priced! Nice place to go on a weekend night for a drink, to dance & play pool! The bar is not packed because not too many people know about it! Too cool!"}
{"text":"There are different areas & each area has a different vibe... Try the tiramisu martini... Ah-Mazing!"}
{"text":"The food EXCELLENT but the wait ridiculous I waited a 1/2 hour for wings and when I got it wrong order now this is the slow time afternoon PLEASE when you order takeout LOOK at the order because I'm sure this has happened many times not happy with the service get MORE HELP !!!!!!! Oh I paid full price for my wings and waited another 20 minutes so the bartender Hispanic  he was terrible your Oops costed you not getting a tip I don't want free food customer service you need to work on !!! And instead of apologizing he said OOPS this is someone who doesn't OWN up to their mistakes all you had to do was say your SORRY I would've left you a tip and been OK and not write a review on YOUR POOR behavior"}
{"text":"uptown is a fun place even if the lanes, and food are OK . live bands are terrible here. I would not go on weekends unless you like terrible cover bands that can hurt your eardrums"}
{"text":"Sexist dress code policy treats men and women differently.   We don't tolerate or support such sexism.
Also some weird preference fo sports jerseys
Not going back until they can treat everyone in our group equally."}
{"text":"I have had great service at this establishment. The last time I was there, I was quite melancholy as it was my deceased son's birthday. The bartender and wait staff went the extra mile to make me a drink to remember! I love this place! I live very close by and am absolutely astounded at some of the poor reviews. This is a wonderful place to just go, sit, watch football and have a beer in a comfy seat."}
{"text":"Hands down best place in surprise! Great food, entertainment! WE LOVE IT HERE! We eat dinner here at least once a week. They wedge salad and loaded fries are to die for!"}
{"text":"I come here every Tuesday I can, to do the $2-$2!bowling/shoes with my family. I buy food and drinks. The service from the staff in the front could be a lot better. The whole game our bumpers were stuck and we told management, and it was very clear, they did not care. It was not busy and I had to waive down a waitress, twice. I try to shop/ eat local because I am a surprise resident. I hope the staff does see this and works on their willingness to take care of the customers!"}
{"text":"Class field trip today.   Customer service has been horrible.   One employee for the entire arcade and laser tag.   Management non existent even after asking for additional help.   Could be sooo much better if the staff actually cared!!"}
{"text":"I am giving only 4 stars because the pricing is just outrageous. I have gone to Uptown Alley a few times and it was a great time but everything is over priced! Not only is the bowling extremely expensive but when you go and add another hour they start the clock before you even get back to your lane. So not only are you paying a very inflated price but you get shorted in the process. If the pricing was more reasonable not only would I go more often but I would give a higher review."}
{"text":"I love to take my grandbabies here! They love the mini cheeseburgers and playing all the games! First the young lady who was our waitress was so sweet and just had the best smile with braces, I wish I could remember her name. She was so cute and patient with my grandbabies.tonight there was a young man named Tyler working in the game room who was amazing! He was so patient with my three year old granddaughter, she loves to go into the prize area and take things! He was so good to her and made sure she didn't get upset when we had to make her put things back. I could tell he really enjoys children and it felt very safe for them! He was such a great young man, you can guarantee we will be back and I'm very thankful to this company for having such a great staff!"}
{"text":"I was excited to finally see a family place in Surprise besides the movie theatre.  We went with our family of 5 and ended up spending $100 for two games (with shoe rental) and lunch.  I was expecting bowling-alley food and to be fair it was quite tasty, although the calamari I ordered was raw in the middle and I had to send it back.  But the prices are the real problem.  An order of chili fries is a cool 6 bucks, a beer is $5, a plate of sliders is $10.  In and of itself not a big deal, but when you add the steep prices all together for a family it's just not worth it.  I would rather drive to Glendale and get the same fries for $3 with a good pitcher of beer and have a ball bowling without having to watch what I order for the sake of prices.  We were looking for a family-friendly hangout and found a swanky, three-bar sprawling palace.  If your family has unlimited means, this might be the place for you.  For us, it will be a one-time thing."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere so much fun and I love the approach! Lazer tag wasnt pricey and it was a great time for the family!"}
{"text":"Had a great time. After 10 was 21 & up. We were in back with a group of 8.   Very fun had dinner food was decent.  Would recommend with friends"}
{"text":"Always have a blast here. The staff is wonderful! Highly recommend bringing friends and family."}
{"text":"Red Embers has some great burgers! I added bacon to mine and they definitely gave me a hearty portion. The burger was super juicy too! The food took a while to come out, so try to patient... Deliciousness is on the way ;)"}
{"text":"It's a fun place but  can not make a  good lemon drop Martini-why do u say u can and u suck . I make sure I ask before i order and as always the bartender say they can and the Martini here suck so if u want a good drink don't go here"}
{"text":"LOVE the 21+ bowling and pool area so my SO and I  didn't have to be around the teenage crowd on our date night.

Did NOT like the restaurant.  Slow service combined with a horrible waitress was just bad.  We ordered a custom burger - and she took the liberty to put on all the other condiments on his burger for him \"because everybody else does\".  If we wanted the custom burger with all the extras, we would have ordered one and she made us feel stupid for complaining about it.  Not going back to the restaurant side ever again."}
{"text":"I like the back room for pool, and the limited access bowling.... feels like an upscale club...BUT... the bartenders are HORRIBLE. The drinks are poured light and they don't know how to make some basic well drinks with skill... PLUS, the drinks are expensive and the pool is pricey too. I wouldn't mind so much if they had table service for drinks OR they comped some pool for a party of six spending over $150.oo on drinks and snacks. The food is OK, not great tho for the price. Somethings gotta give... train up the b-tenders and get some table service OR comp some pool for the money we spend and the trouble we have to thru to get poor drinks.... come on!

Chef Jill and Company."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Uptown Alley for his company happy hour. The 21 and over area is pretty awesome! The service was great! My only complaint is the food, mind you that if it was late and someone was highly inebriated the food would hit the spot BUT seeing as it was 7:30pm and I was on my first beer it was not very good. We ordered the cheese fries, pepperoni pizza, pretzels with cheese fondu, and some pizza puff pastry. The pizza was okay and so was the pizza puff pastry... kind of hard to mess pizza up but it has happened lol. The pretzel with cheese fondue was gross, I would NOT call that dip cheese fondue it tasted like something other than cheese and was very liquid like. Almost like someone took a kraft cheese packet and warm milk then mixed them together (yuck), and the cheese fries reminded me of something you would make at home when you are young not realizing that cheddar cheese hardens on your French fries and makes everything stick together plus it gets cold fast. I've seen quite a few restaurants do this and for the sake of all that is holy use nacho cheese (queso) when making any type of nachos or cheese fries because it doesn't harden up! We will be back again to try other things but that's all I have for this visit."}
{"text":"This was a great place to have my son's 9th birthday party. 4 stars for the venue and 3 for the customer service. The kids had a blast, the adults had a good time, and everyone went to bed early this night lol. It's a lovely place to have a party but I would advise you to stay on top of your hostess and make sure they cater to your every need. Ok so now for the bad....

Our server was always almost gone and couldn't be found at times, frustrating because she was getting a large gratuity from my party so I would expect her to be more available to us. When our food came out, they forgot about the birthday boy's special meal (he is allergic to pizza sauce) and he had to wait for his food to come while the other kids sat down and ate. If anything, he should've been served first!!! The pizza tasted like cardboard paper with some cheese and sauce on top of it. For the amount of money we paid for the pizzas and platters, we expect it to at least be tasty!

The girl they had working the bowling desk was rude to me in front of other patrons and she was very fortunate that it was my son's birthday and I didn't feel like getting into it with her while getting 8 pairs of kids shoes. 

My party had a great time in the venue but for a party that was over $500, we expect 5 STAR Customer Service!"}
{"text":"For a fun game of bowling, this is the place to go. Modern lane design, good food, entertainment, even a game arcade for the kids. If you want to hang out with friends for food and drink in a more adult environment, there is a second bowling area with its own lanes and bar, lounge chairs, a dance floor area, a DJ to handle the music, and pool tables."}
{"text":"Thumbs up for the young lady (Andrea R) at the arcade register. She's was cool and collective when issues with the registry system was failing. 
Not only was she calm with a smile but was able to multitask other areas while waiting for a fix. 
The now long line of Customers were confident in her because she was calm and moving forward with finding solution. 
I will definitely come back again. 
Was able to bring teens to have some fun to kick start their MDW."}
{"text":"Did not expect the great service and great food. The place was pretty empty and the staff accidentally missed us because we already had drinks. But man did they more than make up for it by offering the kids free game cards and ice cream when the \"sorry\" was more than enough. Will definitely come back here. The whole staff is awesome."}
{"text":"I just want to say I love this place, we go to uptown alley at least 3-5 times a week. I am not the best bowler in the world but recently we have been going more and more to improve our games. The environment is very clean and the staff is really great. I can't complain one bit. Their pool is about 12 dollars for an hour, their bar is clean and the waitress is cool. The laser tag is a lot of fun it is 2 stories tall and you can have a lot of fun with your friends here. I really enjoy coming here and will continue to be coming here for a while to come."}
{"text":"We took our 13 year old grandson bowling, for lunch, and to the arcade.
Our pizza lunches that included Caesar salads were delicious and the service was excellent!
The bowling was great!
Our only complaint is that the arcade is seriously overpriced!
Highly recommend the food in the restaurant!"}
{"text":"Restaurant, bowling alley, a bar, arcade games, private party areas....

They have tons of amenities for the whole family! 

We usually go bowling and play games with the kids at this spot. A blowing alley that lights up to create a dance floor type of feel, added by the upbeat, heart pounding music helps give energy and life to the lanes. 

The food is average at best. Its bowling alley, bar food so expectations can't be set too high.

Service is below par, we usually find ourselves looking for a server more so than actually feeling like she's checking on us."}
{"text":"This is how you do entertainment. Um, let me modify that for clarity, this is how you do entertainment for several target audiences. Young, old, sports fans, bowlers, gamers, and the list goes on. I live much closer to this awesome venue now and as long as they keep doing things right, I should be a regular for some time to come.

The first time I visited Uptown Alley was when a friend of mine's band was playing there. Yes, I said they had a live band. When I heard he was playing at a bowling alley, my suspicions of his talents were in question. This was my first time to see him play, mind you. Low and behold, my buddy drummed like a mad man and sang like a boss! Which brings me to my point, this was much more than just a bowling alley. It is a rather sprawling multi-purpose facility. Restaurant, arcade, laser tag, bar, sports lounge, and of course bowling. It's a pretty massive place. I had a couple beers, listened to the music, and called it a night. Very good first impression.

My most recent trip was with family to go bowling. We walked right up, grabbed some shoes, and I was chucking gutter balls before you could say \"SSSTTTTEEEEEERIKE!\" (best said in Al Bundy tone). We ordered a plate of bacon cheese fries while we played a lazy game of pins from a very attentive and pleasant waitress. The bacon cheese fries were pretty good. They sat like a bowling ball in my guts but bowling was never cultured as a San Franciscan vegan sport anyway. I also never saw the bottom of my glass which is always good. Fear not, it was only tea. After a couple games of bowling around the corner to the arcade and some games of air hockey we went. Nobody was injured, so I call that a win.

I would like to emphasize the staff here. I have never had an unpleasant interaction with any of them. It's not like I specifically interviewed anyone and asked about their hopes and dreams but I think you know what I mean. They were knowledgeable, efficient, and best of all friendly. You absolutely need that at an establishment like this. It just makes wrangling the kids together easier knowing you are going to a place where the only attitude you will get is when your kid bowls a better game than you. It's also handy when bellying up to the bar and bartender gives you a smile. It just brings a place like this up a notch from an already solid entertainment model.

This place is great. It's clean, has a warm feeling, and is inviting as soon as you go through the front doors. The layout is logical and easy to navigate. Long rounded walkways make it fun just to travel around the different areas of Uptown Alley whether you are going to the bar for a beer or to the restaurant to rejoin your party. Even the walls are infused with decorative glass or at the very least have paintings to keep the flow going. There are private lanes and rooms for the more mature patrons giving the option of getting a little more intimate with your friends and/or significant others. So the next free night you have with some buds or the family, head on down with a couple dollars and an some energy for fun because this place is sure to have something up your alley. 

I sort of feel bad for that last line, but I am going to leave it in anyway."}
{"text":"Such a fun place. We went on a Saturday afternoon and the place was packed. I don't necessarily think that's a bad thing though. We didn't have to wait at all, got right on to our lane and bowled 3 games. It was a little pricey and warm(but what isn't in Arizona) but we had a really great time. I can't wait to venture in to the restaurant and arcade/laser tag. I hear this is a really popular place on Thursday nights."}
{"text":"We went on a wednesday afternoon so it was pleasant.  My wife and I had a good time.  The service was good and curtious.  We asked to not be put by a bunch of kids and they accommodated.  I have read previous reviews and could see this place at night or on a weekend acting chaotic and like a night club, but for a weekend day and to do some bowling with my wife it was perfect."}
{"text":"We went to Uptown Alley to bowl and play laser tag with our family. It is clean and inviting when you enter. All the staff seemed friendly and helpful. We bowled 2 games with our kids first. The bowling area was comfy and inviting. A good thing to know when bowling with children, you can set up the bumpers to just be on for the kids turn and not all bowlers on that lane. We enjoyed the chip trio (3 dips with chips) for $10.99. The dips were good,maybe a tad under salted, but would order them again. The overall the taste and presentation seemed worth the money. The waitress was very attentive and friendly and supplied us with additional chips to finish the dips and was great at making sure we had enough to drink- even though we only asked for water. The laser tag area was big, air conditioned well, and had plenty of hiding areas and the upper level. 
We will definitely be going back to enjoy some more fun. My only negatives are that it can get pricey (but what can't for a family of 4-6?) I was hoping we could find coupons or specials for combo pricing, but no such luck. 
We recently (in July) visited Wazees World for our sons birthday and compared to Uptown Alley, we would definitely go back to UA. We would have heard about UA sooner if they had more advertising!"}
{"text":"I was not looking forward to eating here. It was loud as we entered with games on tvs, bowling, an arcade and an open kitchen. But we were pleasantly surprised by the service and really good burgers.  In the end the noise wasn't bad we even stayed to play in the arcade after eating.  It turned out to be a great evening."}
{"text":"What sucks about this place is that it could be SO AWESOME if they got their act together. It seems like EVERY TIME I go there the staff screws something up. My latest example was tonight when I wanted to play laser tag. We called ahead and said all systems were go. Then we show up and they say it is closed for a private party? The bowling is expensive. There is nothing special about it to justify the higher price. What sucks is that they know they don't have to provide good service because they are the only game in town. Oh well..."}
{"text":"This place has everything! Best bowling alley ever! Love the fact that they have separate adult bowling lanes as well."}
{"text":"For the time being, this may be the best \"total package\" entertainment venue on the West-Side of Phoenix (Surprise). It has food/drinks (3+ bars throughout)/arcade/laser-tag/bowling/pool/darts/live music/many TV's & a great VIP area sectioned off for the 21+ crowd.
We had a lot of great service here, but in particular, Ryan G.
Ryan answered all of our questions regarding laser-tag, and the arcade. Later that night ended up cleaning our table (near the pool/darts tables) and was very friendly & customer service oriented. Thanks Ryan!"}
{"text":"Our group recently held a bowling tournament at Uptown Alley in the hopes of not just raising funds for scholarships for students in our district, but also to spread some community spirit by supporting a new(er) local business. This review is based on our entire experience.

First of all, Uptown Alley does not really give you any breaks for a group event--not even if you are 501(c)(3) or raising funds for a good cause which they knew was our purpose. They charged us $2 each for shoes and  $15/hr per lane (we had 20 lanes reserved). So essentially, we would have to raise at least $1000 just to break even. We were told they would open up early for us at 8AM but we had to be out by 10AM when they opened. Come to find out they already open at 8AM on Saturdays so they weren't doing us any big favors. They wouldn't help us advertise our event in their facility even though it would have helped draw people to their business. They offered us no freebies to our participants to encourage them to come back. Our group has over 2000 members in the local community that we could market Uptown Alley to and support as a local business but nope...they weren't interested in that at all. We weren't allowed to bring in donuts, juice, coffee or any food related items for our participants even though it was supposedly before they opened for business. We had to order from their restaurant with the sampling of breakfasty type items they had. Essentially, we were made to feel like they were REALLY going out of their way and doing us a favor by even allowing us to have our event there at all. If we weren't so set on trying to support a local business, we really would have gone somewhere else but our group really does make an effort to keep it local whenever possible. 

The day of our event went off without a hitch. The staff was polite, courteous, helpful, kind and considerate. This definitely made up for the way we were treated in arranging this event. The bowling was fun with plenty of space, broad shoe selection, decent food, and drinks. The service was a bit slow considering they knew we had a group coming. There was 1 server for all of us and we were the only people in the place...which did open at 8AM per the sign on the door and their website! And he didn't really come back to check on us so my lane's guests only had 1 drink and that was it. The food was alright though and was definitely not what you would expect from bowling alley cuisine. Our group had fun though...but I think it's because it was a fun activity. I mean who doesn't enjoy BOWLING?

As I've understood it in my efforts to market this event, Uptown Alley isn't very community friendly at all. Our district's special education classes don't even go here because they won't give them a break on price! They go to Peoria to AMF! I'm sorry but if you can't support Special Olympics or SPED and give those kids a break, that's just not saying much about your business's philosophy.

So, although I'd like to say I'd go back to Uptown Alley because they are a local business and its important to support local businesses, it  might be solely as an independent person but not as part of my 501(c)(3) group.  I'm inclined to pass on group efforts since I believe that local businesses should also be supportive of the community. It's got to be a give-and-take relationship."}
{"text":"I love this place, it would have a full 5 stars if the u didn't have to wait 2 hours for a lane and it wasn't so expensive. But maybe there is a wait lost u could call and reserve a spot."}
{"text":"We come here almost EVERY Thursdays night because of their awesome \"BAND/karaoke\" night and the staff is usually chill and cool.. 

The last time we were here (just me and my bf), we ordered chicken wings, nachos, pizza, mozzarella sticks, southwest rolls, French dip & drinks from the bar. 

Got called up to sing up on stage.
Took our food to a table close to the stage.. and when we came back, no more than 5minutes later, all our food was gone. I confronted the girl that was cleaning up our table and told her that \"We weren't done yet..\", all of the plates weren't even empty at all and she didn't even turn around to look at me and all she said was \"oh well..\" And CONTINUED what she was doing!! I WAS HELLA SURPRISED OF HOW RUDE THAT GIRL WAS WHEN I APPROACHED HER NICELY.

I talked to the lady bartender right away, who by the way is just always super sweet and nice to everyone, talked to the manager that night about the incident and the manager came to talk to me but didn't apologize (I'm guessing he was busy running around the whole placer hat  ) , but the lady bartender was apologizing for the girl's mistake, and the manager said he'll take 50% off everything we ordered that was thrown away so we still paid, I guess since we did eat some of the food that was thrown away, when I'm almost 99.9% sure most restaurants would have comped that if this was the situation but he didn't, maybe he's a new manager. But we just wanted to get out of there so we paid without anymore conflicts. 

My bf and I used to worked in the food&beverage industry and we know it's really not just the food that makes the guests come back but the hospitality of the staff and service too."}
{"text":"Ryan was our bartender here one night and was so entertaining and friendly. Very quick although it appeared he was working alone. Great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Great place! Fun bowling, games and Lazer tag. I had my daughters 10th birthday party here and it was a great success! Shannon took unbelievably good care of us. Everyone in our party was impressed by her great service. She was welcoming, friendly and attentive. I went with the bowling upgrade package which included games and Lazer tag. It was a great value. Everyone in our party had a great time and said they would come back. All the facilities are brand new and top notch. There is something for everyone. I would highly recommend this to anyone for any occasion. Thanks for the fun Uptown Alley. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"What a rude management on a Christmas Day! Blowed up my mind ! Ended up to cancel my playlist for principal! Watching just friends game.... my last freaking time here!!!! 
Better to spend my money someplace else !"}
{"text":"I come here once a week for a reason, happy hour, half price beer and apps. They have an okay selection if beers and tons of great apps, the nachos are huge and only four bucks. The wings are great and the sliders are killer. Anyone in surprise should come check this place out, bowling is a little expensive and the arcade section is pretty little but I love to come here and drink and share apps with my friends."}
{"text":"Way over priced. The food is horrible, service ok, and games are super expensive.  Wouldn't recommend, stinks it's the only bowling alley close by."}
{"text":"I love coming to this place. My daughter and I always have fun. They have really good lanes. The food is amazing."}
{"text":"My review for the restaurant: took my family here they had specials on food for happy hour. First the service was awesome and I had no complaints. The food is good and very reasonably priced. They have a wide selection and food and tons of tvs to keep you entertained.

The only complaint I have about this place is about the arcade. They charge money to purchase a card so you can spend more money to load it so you can use it for the video games.

It if was not for the awesome service I would have given 4 stars"}
{"text":"I attended Circle k employee event held here at Uptown Alley. We had a private room called The Approach with 10 lanes,2 pool tables, and bar.The food was great and service was outstanding. I'll definitely going back ."}
{"text":"March madness beer special is nice $2 drafts anytime.  Wish they'd play the audio from the sports games.  Food's always good"}
{"text":"My husband and I and another couple have attended Uptown Alley a few times now over the last few weeks.  We have never actually bowled or tried any of the other activities accept for eating and drinking, so I can only speak to that.  
The happy hour is a really good deal.  During happy hour you can get appetizers for half price.  We always order the steak and blue cheese flatbread.  I always ask for it to be medium rare so that the steak will at least come out medium.  I have also had the BBQ pulled pork sliders and the BBQ wings.  I'll order those again!  You can get a well drink for about $2 and change.  Even when the drinks are full price they aren't bad.
They have a 21 and over area which is nice."}
{"text":"I've been here before but to the Phoenix location. Recently I moved and went again to the surprise location and fell in love with the place. I have been two or three times to the surprise location. Uptown alley has bowling, two side bars, pool table, laser tag and arcade games. It is so much fun! Oh and food. I must not forget food. Haha, as well as tv. I believe the laser tag is only $2. The bowling is also pretty cheap. But bring socks, other wise you have to pay for that too. Which if you're a penny pincher like me, you don't wanna have to pay for socks you'll never actually wear besides to go bowling. I'm not sure what the food tastes like. I haven't had it before. Not that I can remember. But I definitely recommend this place. Oh and I think sometimes at the surprise location they have karaoke. I've seen them have karaoke. And they are also open much later than most places which is nice cause then if you live in the area and want to stay out late, it's the perfect spot! :)"}
{"text":"We were lucky enough to receive a VIP invitation for today's grand opening! We did a lot in the three hours we were there, when you walk in it makes you feel like you are in one of the Las Vegas Casinos. Even though they claim to be a family theme bowling alley. To me it's more of a young adult theme event. But there is nothing wrong with that. To much to tell you about this place. You must pay a visit or get on there web site for more info. I felt like a kid again, playing in the arcade for a couple of hrs. Food is really good at their restaurant, especially their boom boom shrimp!! Awesome!! Again, a must visit at least once so you can see how it is."}
{"text":"My family and I visited Uptown Alley for the first time yesterday. We bowled 10 frames, had a bite to eat while we bowled (with my 1.5 year old so it took a little longer) and then walked around to check the place out. 

The overall feel of the place is great. There is a restaurant, an arcade, the bowling lanes, VIP bowling lanes and a lounge w/dance floor. I also heard there was a two story laser tag area although we didn't see this. 

The bowling was wonderful--almost all the lanes were filled. We ordered the pepperoni pizza, fried mozerella and a beer. The food was delicious! My only complaint was that the waiter told me that for a pint of Fat Tire the cost would be 4.25...when it was actually 5.50. Clearly the waiters need to brush up on the menu/cost of the items they are selling.

When we were ready to go, we walked aroun the establishment to see what all it was about. I was really impressed with the lounge area and all the 'nooks and cranny's you could go to realx, have a bite to eat and a cocktail. 

I will give the place another try for sure to see how some of the other areas measure up."}
{"text":"Will update accordingly, but we did NOT bowl since their hours are very short compared to all other bowling alley's normal hours on weekends should be 9am-2am and weekdays one hour earlier is fine but 1am is horrible it's bad that we went for our first time and it was already closing but we only went in for a drink 8.50 for a daiquiri and a pint is 5.00 it's just beer....so being there for only 30 minutes we paid 22.10 before tip for 3 drinks..... ridiculous! It should have been around 5 for drinks and 3 for beer thats reasonable but I'm only judging by the drinks since were looking for a new bar in town......so far not a big deal going sat to bowl but may just go to Peoria lanes....guess well see."}
{"text":"I love this new spot in Surprise. It's great for families during the hot summer days! Surprise really needed something fun for kids and families. For the 21 plus crowd - the private VIP area called The Approach has a full bar and 10 lanes of private bowling. I'm thinking about renting this room out for my next birthday party!

The place gets crowded, so call and make a reservation. 

I tried the food, and it's much more than typical bowling alley food. They have pizza, salads, wings, everything! Their cocktail list is also robust. 

Go during happy hour to get discounts on appetizers and drinks. YUM!

2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"When i first walked into uptown alley I was impressed, there was a good vibe and everything was colorful. Other than the fact that it was a Friday evening and it was packed there is plenty of to keep your self occupied. There is a bar and grill, a arcade, a 2 story lazer tag and obviouslly the bowling alley. My son did the laser tag and loved it, it was cheap and fun, wether it was you and 3 friends or 20 people you don't know it's fun. The food at the grill was ok, not the best food ever but it's just a reastraunt in a bowling alley. The arcade games are cool, there are lots of games I haven't seen before and touch screen games, I was impresses. Finally the lanes, they are new aged modern lanes and those ball return things with new. Screens and everything. There is also a area for adults only that has bowling and pool. All in all I give the bowling alley a 4/5 and I will probably be going back."}
{"text":"Went here last Friday with my wife and sister in law to \"The Approach\" room towards the back for the over 21 age group. It was only $5/hour more for a lane and great. The place is very clean and well maintained, the environment is fun and exciting, and the food and drink was all well prepared. We bowled for two hours, had al3 trays of appetizers brought out, and all three of us had a few drinks with refills which costs just under $200 for the whole night including tips. Not cheap, but the food and drink prices are pretty competitive with nearby sit down restaurants. Staff was also friendly and helpful, and even asked if we wanted a one hour bowling then add half hours on after. Our last was about to finish short due to the timer, so our waitress added a few minutes for us to take our time paying the bill and finishing the last 2 frames."}
{"text":"We had fun, service was good, but with it being so crowded it was hard to find a table near the bowling and hard to really enjoy the arcade area because of the crowd...but that's a bit to be expected when you have a variety of activities under one building and it being the only of its kind out this way."}
{"text":"The manager of this place is an absolute idiot! We were in with 6 friends, all of whom are in the bar business, spending money in the bar. He comes up to me an demands that I either turn my shirt inside out or leave because it's a Support Trump shirt. Lol, when my girl and I walk out parked out front are 5 squad cars who responded to the dumbass' 911 call. BTW, the officers all liked my shirt!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch for the 2nd time and it was bad for the 2nd time. My husband was served the wrong meal and my Cali chicken was the consistency of a thick rubber yoga mat. Upon telling the waitress she just took it away and didn't apologize, ask if she could get me anything else, offer to replace it... Nothing. Will never go back for food there again."}
{"text":"Went in on a Monday to relax and have a couple brews with friends. We weren't immediately available to order when Kristin came to take our order, besides beers. She eventually took our second round order with food. Her service was extremely slow and not personal. I have been in the service industry in a previous life and know you have to work to turn customers into regulars. This was clearly not an intention of hers. She did check back on us once to see if we needed anything but were okay at the time. We kept talking, hoping she'd come by to see if we were tasty to close out/wanted more or anything but nothing. After 45 minutes, with serious consideration for walking out, I had to go to the bar and ask her for the check. She was pretty nice at that point but it was beyond too late. Avoid the place on a Monday night for drinks!!!"}
{"text":"This place needs some work for sure! First off how do you not have the ball ramps for younger kids?? You mean to tell me they are all broken?? How frustrating! There were many parents that felt ripped off because of the simple fact that the children were displeased with not being able to bowl with the ramps. It's was a sore sight to see looming down the lanes that every young child was upset cause they couldn't bowl like they anticipated with the ramps. After having bare witness with my grand daughter being let down and disappointed I doubt I will ever return to this place. Can't go wrong with their competitors. One day not have the ramps for kids cost this place my future business."}
{"text":"The actual arcade and bowling alley are extremely clean and functional (no out of order signs on the arcade games). However..... The staff there is less than exceptional. I requested wait service at the bowling alley three times and didn't get it. By the end of the first game I just went to the bar to order drinks and the women behind the bar told me the bartender wasn't here right now but she would be back shortly. 5 or so minutes later she asked me if she could just take my drink order. That being said, The arcade staff was present, attentive and pleasant to interact with."}
{"text":"My holiday work party took place here, but I've been here several times before for happy hour. The happy hour food typically seems pretty good, but I'm not sure if that's the happy hour drinks \"talking\" or my actual true fondness of comfort appetizers post-work days. 

I like Uptown Alley, because it is one of the few places that you can go to on the West side of town that offers so many things at one place. Maybe I don't want to drive an entire hour to Lucky Strike downtown but I still enjoy the luxuriousness of sitting on nice couches and a \"fancier\" setting while bowling. Uptown Alley is the answer!

Kids have plenty of fun too! There's a big laser tag area as well as a gaming area that although not quite as big as Dave and Buster's, it still has plenty of similar new games at hand. They're not just for kids either. Adults can partake in the fun too!

There is a restaurant that serves decent food, and they're very well organized at handling private parties. 

If you don't want to be around kids, there's even a separate \"club\" area for adults only to enjoy bowling, games, and drinks. 

I'm really happy to have this place around! It's so convenient, because you can always find stuff for people with all interests to do or enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great place for karaoke!  Very fun atmosphere.

A little over priced for laser tag and bowling."}
{"text":"We recently used uptown alley as our venue for a business meeting/incentive training for our company a few weeks ago. Terry, the general manager gave us a great deal on a package of bowling and food for the evening. My team and I were all pleased with the service, food, and atmosphere of this place. Laser tag also happened to be amazing. Thanks again!"}
{"text":"Last week I attended a private event and had an incredibly fun time.  The folks that hosted the event as well as the staff were not only enjoying being with us but were extremely attentive and helpful.  This place feels like a \"neighborhood\" hang-out.  I have been to this establishment a handful of times and have never been disappointed.  I've eaten dinner and the food and service are top notch.  I've watched sporting events on the BIG screen, played laser tag with my Grandkids and have even bowled a couple of times.  Uptown Alley is by far the best all around entertainment venue in the West Valley (Surprise). It offers everything and at a reasonable price.  They run terrific specials all of the time.  Make sure to book your next Birthday Party or Company Event here....You will not be disappointed !!!"}
{"text":"Just got some new beers on tap. Food is good but not great. They had a better menu in the past but they changed it about 2 years ago. Very clean and comfy. It has a 21 and over area. A small area like a club. Live band Friday and Saturday."}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews below im shocked to hear they didn't get good service. Maybe it was our lucky day. Never been here before but we got a good recommendation to try it out. On our way we go. Upon walking in im immediately impressed. Clean,AC running, and smiling faces in the restaurant area. I asked a few questions and we sat down. I immediately wanted to see more so I gave our waitress our drink order and off I went. Good size game area for the kids up front, a couple pool table (wish they had more), Bowling lanes (in black light), 21 & up bowling/Bar area!!!! ( reminds me of SD-EV Tavern+Bowl back home), and some private rooms you can book. Bars looked awesome. Sat back down, Ice cold beer waiting, ordered the pizza/wing special, tacos for my main squeeze, and sliders for the kiddos. Everything came out warm, great timing, and it was delish! the wings especially. Spicy Garlic something wings.....Bomb....cant wait to come back. I can see that they maaaaybe might be slammed from time to time and service suffers....but thats no excuse for not coming here.Maybe its just me but if im not getting service somewhere, I get up and do it myself...especially if you see their busy! 

Oh ya and I totally forgot...I believe the managers name was Tim, but he came by to check on us and gave my little girl $5 game card...SCORE!! 

We'll BE BACK~!"}
{"text":"Went to Uptown Bowling to celebrate a friends special event. Food was good, waitress was good. But once it hit like 8pm (maybe 9pm) the Adults only area turned into a \"strip joint\". The lights went down and video screens went up and apparently instead of Vevo or MTV videos that are appropriate for all races, they only played naked \"silhouetted\" African Americans. I'm sorry but I didn't pay for 2 hours of bowling to watch naked girls on the screen while I'm bowling. I'm so offended that I will never go back. I get playing to one race, but what about the rest?  I'm not racist or sexist, but seriously...it was totally geared toward the black man.  Unfortunately, that's not the only people in your crowd. I talked to several strangers in the restroom who were as offended as I."}
{"text":"Uptown Funk You Up!!!!   Live entertainment was excellent!  Needed a little more liquid encouragement to dance, but it was on like Donkey Kong!!    Cant wait to do it again!!"}
{"text":"They should have a way of making it known that after 10 pm it becomes a 21+ over venue. Most of us had IDs but some didn't , we weren't even planning on drinking , we drove so far as well. I don't understand the logic behind that. Also the staff was rude , I'm guessing they weren't happy we were there 45mins before closing. Only good thing I noticed about this place was that it was clean.  Also I wanna add the atmosphere was not that great as well. Mostly irritated about the 21+ thing."}
{"text":"This place seemed like the perfect place to have a good time and get some food. The facilities here are not to bad (bowling, laser tag, games) bit the restaurant is terrible. Where do I start...

Our waiter I am pretty sure was under the influence of some form of stimulant (meth is my prediction). He was acting all kinds of crazy and saying weird things. It took thirty minutes to get a glass of water, fifteen minutes to get our alcoholic beverages. The mixed drinks were not good at all and all the draft beers tasted the same. I seriously could not tell the difference between Coors Light and Miller Light, so I dont know what they were pushing through those taps. 

Now the food...The food was very bland and plain. Very overpriced. Our meals took forever to get to us and they only brought half or meals. We had to ask for the rest. 

We also had to ask for the check, and then it took forever as our waiter was chatting it up with his friends standing outside the restaurant. Seriously? He also offered the police officer working there a beer that he was holding and then started laughing at his own joke. The cop didn't find it funny, neither did I as I could not wait to get out of there. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Great place for families with kids and a private 21+ area! So if you dont want to be around kids or teens you can go to the back area. Perfect hang out spot and family fun day. Kids bowl free on Mondays.

Food is good, service was great, this is by far the best bowling alley I have been to. We will be here often."}
{"text":"Great place to hangout, especially with large groups. Laser tag, arcade, bowling, 3 full bars, VIP section, lounge, sports area with huge screens, and a pretty good restaurant. We seriously needed something like this in Surprise. I only with they were open later during the week."}
{"text":"Very cool place and very big the 2 hour wait for a lane was excessive but they want you to buy drinks and it worked. Good times"}
{"text":"I came back to uptown ally for the second time this week to play some pool and arcade games with friends. I gotta say it was another great experience, I haven't tried the arcade yet and I think it was a bit expensive... a lot of the games took up a lot of your credits in such little time. I left my friend with the card for a few minutes and when I came back half the credits were gone by him only playing the claw machine, that was a bit disappointing. But anyway the pool was great and we had a blast scoring some trick shots and such and we still enjoyed the arcade. I will be coming back here regularly with friends if we ever want to play bowling, pool, laser tag, etc - so 4/5 today."}
{"text":"Worst service ever!!  Second time we have been here. I can honestly say this is the worst service I've ever had. Took my family of 6 adults for two hours of fun. It was $99.00 for all of to bowl. Guy at the counter was rude. Said it's an 1hr half. Ok so let's get some food. We waited 15 mins just for the hostess to seat us. By the time the waiter got to the table the light up thing went off for our turn to bowl.  Had to flag down the waiter to order $100.00 of food and drinks.
1hr later received the pizza then 30 mins later got our drinks (1hr after we ordered) the drinks were all watered down and pizza was soggy. 
Then he never came back. As I was walking out the door he was yelling my name to pay. I wasn't about to go hunt you down! You knew where I was the whole time. Horrible, rude and just unorganized. 
We will never attend this place again.
I hope they build an ally and a theater out here in Surprise that makes uptown ally go out of business. What a waste of $250 bucks."}
{"text":"This place never fails us.  Out of all the places in Surprise, we know we can come to Uptown Alley and be seated within the first 5 minutes.  Food is great, no matter what you pick of the menu. They have a nice twist on their spinach/artichoke dip. I would highly recommend it if you like a little twist to what you would normally expect. Also, their southwester rolls in the appetizer section with the siracha aoili dip were tasty  (if you like some zing). The bartender does great job on drink creations, so whether you go with a drink from the menu or ask them to create something for you, you won't be disappointed.  And service is always superb."}
{"text":"I reserved a party for my boys and the service was great! The server overwhelmed but had a great attitude. I would recommend it!"}
{"text":"The drinks are tasty and the band was fabulous!  Enjoyed some dancing and visiting with my friends!"}
{"text":"Used to be my family's and Is favorite place to go to spend money. Now they set up false advertised merchandise so you spend all your money only to find out that they don't have what you want or give you every excuse as to why they don't have it while being smug, the only reason I gave more than one star is location to home is good and most of the time there service is good but the service the last 3 years have been flushed, constantly short staffed and the employees barely check on you generally you have to seek someone out to get service. The menu changes every 4-6 months hard to keep track.  Even as a regular I would now choose a different place if it wasn't my daughters 6 birthday and she wanted a redemption gift that wasn't available now not only your business didn't hold up there end of the bargain I as a father feel I didn't hold up mine thanks uptown alley for ruining my day yet again and your management team seems to enjoy the negativity hope you feel good about yourselves. Final note is I asked for the manager on duty and did not get the actual manager only a pawn then noticed the actual manager and had same smug remarks that it's just a display in the redemption area. Seems to be a hit or miss with service anymore half the time it's great and the other half falls way short. Again I have to say after trying to continue to repeat business there service sucks can not redeem your credits for anything al usual have to order so you spend money on game o revive an item you think you can win only to have them say will order it well I ordered something last go and it took freakin 7 weeks I don't spend my  to  wait on something that is displayed unbelievable they made it right jack did an outstanding job shout out for the first time after no one would help he stepped up thanks jack!"}
{"text":"My family and I go here ALL THE TIME! We love their food! We also love going there on nights out with friends and seeing our favorite bartender Caludia! She has been our bartender for a year and a half now! She always has a smile on and is very friendly and polite to all her customers! THANKS FOR MAKING OUR TIME AT UPTOWN THE BEST! :)"}
{"text":"As mentioned by another reviewer, this place is a great \"all in one\" spot for everyone from families to friends to single people wanting some nightlife.  

We have been here several times.  They have laser tag and an arcade for the kids.  They have family bowling and private bar area bowling, pool tables, and a full bar/restaurant.  They even had a corn hole tournament going while we were there.  

We showed up and we were told that there was a waiting list for bowling and the wait was about an hour.  This surprised me because there were a lot of empty lanes.  We went to the restaurant to get a bite to eat and were called for bowling about 15 minutes later which was a nice surprise.  Luckily I was able to catch the waiter and tell him we were leaving to bowl before he put our food order in.  I don't think it would have been a big deal though because I think all the food comes from this place anyway and they probably could have delivered it to our lane.  

We got our shoes and lanes and started bowling.  They have music and TVs you can see while bowling.  We ordered food, which was from the same menu and selection as in the restaurant.  It would have been nice if the waiter at the restaurant told us we could have just kept our order in and they would deliver it to our lane since we were starving and had to wait twice as long, but no biggie.  

The food was great!  A friend had a burger which was awesome.  The fires it came with were also great.  They had great seasoning.  I had pizza which was great also.  The pepperoni were large and flavorful.  

This place isn't cheap but not as expensive as you would think to have someone wait on you at your lane while you're bowling.  This is a far cry from the typical bar food style bowling alley filled with smoke.

My only complaint is if you are a serious bowler it's a little messy.  Because they allow and even encourage people eating at the lane there was a lot of crumbs and food on the floor.  The approach was hideous obviously not clean so there was no glide whatsoever.  I didn't mind, because like I said you would have to be a serious bowler, but I could see how this would annoy those wanting to have a serious game."}
{"text":"I love this place! Arcade, bowling, bars, food, laser tag... I could go on, but I don't want to. The prices are a bit much, but it is like a one stop shop for entertainment. It's nice to have this place. Especially, way out here in Surprise. Fun for the whole family. Service is definitely lacking, but the good times make up for that."}
{"text":"I love this place.  We had a small unofficial birthday party for my youngest step-son here this last weekend.  I didn't do a party package (I priced that it is was pretty steep, but seemed almost worth it cuz of the attention you get and space... ) but anyway.  We still had plenty of room, and lucked out big time to be there during the anniversary party and got 2 for 1 deals on game tag, and great arcade deals.  The kids were so busy we didn't have time to enjoy the anniversary bonus activities, bounce house and face painting.  We also ordered pizza and I was impressed with how yummy it was.  It costs more than it should, but it is good.  Our waitress was super nice also.  The staff we encountered we all in a good mood, even though they were busy, so I really appreciated that.  (We have been here in the past and not experienced this, one employee was more than rude, but I didn't see him this time.)  Cant wait to come back for an adult night with the hubby and get a cab home! :)"}
{"text":"2 games for 4 people with shoes was $52.00.   Not horrible.  Not cheap.  Good time?  Yes!"}
{"text":"Alley is really nice but the customer service isn't very good. The waitress told my husband once he ordered our drinks that we need to make sure we don't steal the copper mug because she would need to pay $40 out of her own paycheck for it.  The food was cold and the cheese for the pretzels had already separated.  My family and I played in the arcade and they had one person documenting everything bought at a snail speed as the line continued to get longer. I do not recommend nor will we ever go back as the prices are excessive as well."}
{"text":"We have been there a few times. We love that there is so much to do in one spot. A great place to meet friends and hang out. The only issue I have is that it closes so early on the weekends. We would've loved to have a full adult night out. 

We have yet to experience everything this place has to offer but we had fun in the adult section and plan to use it for our birthday next year!"}
{"text":"My family and I love bowling and Uptown Alley is a great place. What I love is the food and drink. It isn't like any other bowling alley where they only have burgers, fries and nachos. They have a real restaurant in there.

Now, there is a piece of advice that I would really like to give to Uptown Alley's management team. The advice I want to give them is to please somehow instruct all of their customers about bowling etiquette either by explaining to them what bowling etiquette is or by posting it so that everyone can see exactly what bowling etiquette is supposed to be.

Every time I bowl here it seems like there's a family next to me or a couple or what have you that when I'm standing up ready to bowl they're not giving me my space. They are also trying to bowl themselves while I'm still trying to bowl next to them and you're supposed to wait for the person next to you to finish bowling before you step onto the wood and pick up your ball.

I don't think it would be that difficult to hand out a flyer that explains the rules or to Simply verbalize the rules when they pick up their shoes and pay for their bowling so that everyone is on the same page because nothing frustrates me more than somebody that is disrespectful to others and people need to know that when it comes to bowling. If you're there to bowl have respect and don't have your kids running around and all kinds of other nonsense.

I was considering giving this a four-star instead of a five-star but the fact that people don't have respect is not the bowling alleys problem or responsibility so I gave it a five-star but food for thought, maybe you guys can do something to alleviate the problem."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Shannon the bar tender is legit! Good food. Bipolar music. We had nachos prime dip and burgers. All were very yummy. Great place to go on a Saturday afternoon."}
{"text":"Been here numerous times for various different occasions. This bowling alley is a lot newer and a lot nicer than a lot of other ones. Highly recommended for a date night spot, with good food, arcade games, and even laser tag. There's something for everybody here."}
{"text":"Great place to go bowling! Great atmosphere and the food is really good. Especially the wings!! Definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"We had my daughter's birthday party here and everyone had a great time!  Izzy was our server and she was excellent!  Give that girl a raise!  I scheduled for 2 hours of bowling, that included 2 lanes, unlimited sodas, 2 pizzas, and a GIANT cookie.  Izzy helped all the kids get their shoes and balls, she got all of our drinks and food, even helped serve it.  The atmosphere is awesome, definitely the best bowling alley I've been to!  I'll definitely be back, especially for an adult night!  I hear they have a live dj and live band, karaoke, laser tag, pool tables, arcade, and did I mention a full bar!?"}
{"text":"There's a lot to do here at Uptown Alley. I've been here for laser tagging with kids as well as happy hour with adults. There is a wide range of activities to do while you're there no matter what age. My personal favorite is the laser tag, although I do wish the arena was a little bigger as there are not many spots to hide when you're playing. 

The red ember restaurant is pretty good, but is a pretty typical American-style restaurant."}
{"text":"I bring my son here all the time to hang out with his friends to bowl and play laser tag. I got an email from Uptown inviting us to test out new menu items. The food was AMAZING! Loved everything! My son had the watermelon salad- yum and the chicken alfredo pizza- also yum. His friend had the mozzarella sticks- made with fresh cheese and to die for! I had the avocado egg rolls and the chicken wrap- perfect amount of spice and REALLY REALLY good. I would have never have thought to come and eat here before because I thought it was more of a kids place! The bar and restaurant are VERY nice and our waitress was spectacular! I will definitely be back! I might even play laser tag!"}
{"text":"Stopped here on Sunday Afternoon to watch some football as we had seen their really nice outdoor patio, and we like outdoor patios.  Lots of visible screens from outside, good drinks, good food, great staff and a great patio.  We have not taken advantage of all the stuff in the huge indoor area, but will be next time there."}
{"text":"Really cool environment, I like the 21+ area because it's a little more calm and quiet than the other side, the drinks are always amazing and so is the food, i mainly got appetizers to snack here and there in between drinks with friends and will be back definitely."}
{"text":"Pretty cool place. Somewhat pricey for families."}
{"text":"Its a cool place to go, especially due to its location. Not much else going on in surprise, so this place will thrive. 

The place is spacious, with lots of bars, and places to sit. The arcade section is kind of small...btu hey, there's an arcade section! You can also play laser tag...pretty cool. They have a lounge section which is nice, but when we sat down at the couch section, no one came to take our order. It was the same in the adult lounge/bowling alley. Plenty of places to sit, plenty of employees walking around yet no one to take a drink order. To bowl in the adult section is pricey...i think it was approx 30 bucks. 

All in all, a nice place to go if you live in suprise."}
{"text":"Brought my 11 year old and his friend for laser tag and games and thought my husband and I would bowl while we waited for the kids.  We were told it was a 2 1/2 hr wait so needless to say we didn't get to bowl even though there was actually a lane not being used.  The kids had fun but the one thing they were disappointed in was that their game cards didn't have any points to spend on toys etc... $50 in games yet no points issued?  You can't give kids cheesy toys or crappy candy to make them feel like it was worth spending time here?   No thanks!   We'll find something else to do next time! 

We did order food for the kids and that was good!   This place has decent food with decent prices. .  They just don't care about their customers experience b/c it's the only place out here so no competition to worry about!"}
{"text":"Been here several times and always have a good experience.  My kids enjoy the bowling and games.  The food and drinks are reasonable.  Food is above average bar food.  The pretzel bite things are the best.  Prices are average.  Sometimes the wait staff leaves you hanging...that's my only complaint."}
{"text":"We did not eat here but we did play games and they were so super! Incredibly clean and well maintained which was great! They had way better prizes as well and I loved the fact that we did not have to hold tickets they loaded directly to the card. I totally want to go back and eat and bowl though!"}
{"text":"Too loud, too out of control, no staff around to offer any help. Screaming preteens running wild everywhere right next to adults drinking. Bad combination if this is supposed to be a family hangout."}
{"text":"Very cool place!  When bowling, service is slow. Just go get drinks or food from the bar! Otherwise, great atmosphere and nice set up in the bowling alley!"}
{"text":"The restaurant inside deserves 10 stars!! Inside out taquito and Philly cheese steak with actual cheese wiz!! We have all of our company Christmas parties at the bowling alley and they treat us great, always on top of everything and it's a blast!!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 5 stars because the concept is awesome.  I have only been here twice but I am certain I will go back.  It is a huge place with a bar (2 I think), arcade, upscale bowling alley, laser tag, and I am sure i am missing stuff because I have not even walked the entire place.  It is nice, new, and upscale for a casual place for families.  It is really loud which is good if you already have kids since you don't want yours standing out.  There are huge TV screens all over and one that must be over 100\", the drinks are decent and the prices are typical (don't come here if you are cheap).  The service is pretty good, never had a problem and the food was okay but all I have eaten was steak sliders (which barely had sliced beef on it) and chicken fingers (cant really screw that up).  I do want to go back and eat here again since I really didn't go hungry so to be fair I wont deduct for the food.  I really appreciate places like this for families to go.  So once again it gets 5 stars just for existing and if you demand perfect service or complain about every little thing,  I really don't want you to be in the same building as me anyway...you are probably annoying."}
{"text":"A+ on customer service! Especially from Kristin J - director of sales and marketing. She went out of her way to make a great experience affordable to our school."}
{"text":"Took my nine-year-old daughter and her friends for her birthday. She had a great time!! The staff was great. The arcade is fun. And for the adults the bar has a good selection"}
{"text":"Been here plenty of times and always encounter SOMEONE on staff with an attitude! servers at the Red Embers restaurant are slow forgetful and act like me asking for good service is such a hassle! Thank God for Claudia, the bartender at the bar in that area! She always goes around to the tables the patio wherever, to make sure everyone has their drinks food or has even been helped. Went with a group of co workers ordered drinks waited around 5...10....15 minutes and Claudia came over, she must've seen us looking around thirsty, and asked what we ordered... No writing anything down just went straight to the bar got our drinks and came back with them BEFORE the server ever came back to ask what we had ordered again! As far as the place it is a great environment, so many things to do and great place to meet up for drinks, dinner, arcade, bowling whatever. Just wish there were more people like Claudia on staff!!"}
{"text":"I hate that this place isn't better! It's a nice place and mostly clean but the staff here is horrible in every department! Took my kids here on 3/22/17 and we were just going to bowl a couple games. We waited in line and the girl at the counter was miserable looking and just asked \"how many?\" I said \"hi I have 3, and we need a ramp, are there any available?\" She rolled her eyes and said no, all our lanes are full. It will be a long wait. And then she turned around and walked away.... ummm...ok??? 
I decided to go to the arcade to kill some time while we waited. The guy at the arcade counter never smiled or said hello either (apparently you don't have to be a people person to work here). I asked what was the best deal on card prices and he just pointed to a sign...after about an hour of games we cashed in our tickets and went to go check if the lanes cleared. 
The same not so friendly girl was there and took down my name and number so she could call me once a lane was cleaned. After about 20 minutes we were called and paid. I asked the girl if someone would be bringing us a ramp, or where to get one and she just said \"they are over in that area where your lane is\".... ok??? I've never been here before so I don't know where that is... we get our shoes and the guy who helped us was nice. He helped carry my sons' lightweight balls to our lane(he had to look up our lane because the girl never told us, she just said \"over there\". The shoe guy also got us a ramp, super helpful. 

So, there was only one server and she was busting her butt trying to get to everyone. Management really should've had another girl on the floor. We didn't even get drinks until we were there for an hour. And no management was even on the floor checking on people who were upset. Horrible. Also, into our 1st game a ball got stuck in the gutter behind the bumper, I called and spoke to the not-so-friendly girl up front and she said she'd send someone to get the ball... nobody did. By the end of the second game, the server actually saw it and got it herself. Honestly, I'm probably never going back because of the service, or lack there of. Sucks to suck and this place is the worst!"}
{"text":"This place is a joke... workers work their hardest and management sucks... get new management and maybe I'll think about going back.. I'll be spreading the word around ..."}
{"text":"Came here for a family get together/nephews bday party. Overall, staff wasn't friendly. Had no customer service skills. We waited for an hr to get on our lanes, so in the meantime, we wanted to order drinks and appetizers for the kids. It took forever for us to find anyone willing to acknowledge us. We walked over to one of the bars. The bartender looked right at us and walked out. They had closed this bar because they said it was too slow, however we were there on a Saturday evening and the place was apparently pretty busy considering we had a hr wait! Finally got on our lanes and on the 3rd frame, one of our lanes malfunctioned. Again, it took a miracle to locate a manager, so we told our server the issue. She told us she would tell her manager. Again, we wait. And wait. The family members who were on the other 2 lanes continued playing; they got thru their first game while the other family members sat & waited for a new lane or someone to repair the guard that sweeps the floor after the pins fall. The manager was kind, but really offered no solution since all the lanes were busy. (Other bar was still closed even though every lane was being used...and yes, people had cocktails, so opening the other bar would've made sense). All in all, we shoulda just went to a Brunswick bowling alley. Won't be back. We spent a lot of money there too. What a shame. The manager ended up comping the one lane and gave the kids $15 game cards so the rest of our group could bowl, but we had to make that request ourselves."}
{"text":"This is your standard Bowling and Entertainment Center. The food is good, service is good, and the place is clean. You can eat, drink, bowl, play games, lazer tag, ect..
Only complaint is that the dinning areas are a little too loud for dinner conversation."}
{"text":"Huge place. Great selections of games while you wait for your lane. You can call ahead to reserve your lane. The have a private area with a bunch of lanes for 21 and up. Good music. The food is great. Friendly staff. Just slightly unorganized."}
{"text":"We visited Uptown Alley last night for our first time. The atmosphere was pretty neat and upbeat. We decided to eat dinner before hand, which was all around good service and good food. We decided to purchase a hour of bowling. Our bowling lane kept malfunctioning during the hour. We ended up speaking with a manager after our server had to reset our lane about six times. Ryan really took care of us and made our experience a really good time. He is a great example of awesome customer service. Thank you! We will be back."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money. I used to come here almost every other weekend and had horrible service and was always waiting a long time to be helped! Until we had a server, Ashley D, who was always on top of it and my family and I always requested her as our server, but just recently learned she no longer works there and I will not be returning! Management is unhelpful and everyone else is slow!"}
{"text":"I use to come here all the time back in the day! I have some great memories here. But to get to the point the workers are awesome. Anything you need they will go out of their way to accommodate you and make you happy. The bowling is fun lol especially when you have the bumpers up  (all strikes I swear). The food isn't bad and the drinks are perfect. You'll find a lot of people in the military here because it's so close to the base. Overall this place is pretty awesome. Hopefully I can come back when in AZ. 


Give it a try"}
{"text":"My kids had a blast here! My husband and I really enjoy bowling, so the atmosphere was a great plus. The arcade had my kids reeling. We didn't try laser tag, but we are considering this place for my son's 6th birthday party."}
{"text":"My family really enjoys this place. I'm giving a four rather than five star only because I feel the price to bowl is excessive compared to other bowling alleys. You can catch a break if you come very early on a Saturday. I've had two birthday parties here for my son. It's a good place to do a party. The hosts are always kind and accommodating. The food is decent. Our favorite is the Old Bay wings. It's always crowded here so it's clear the city's residents love it here."}
{"text":"My family and I have been having a great time watching the NBA playoffs and Finals. Watched game 4 there the other night and the place was extremely busy. Our server was Amira and she busted her tail off all night. My son and I witnessed x3 different groups who got served the whole game and either didn't tip or \"dine & dash\". Just wanted to say good job to Amira for her work ethic and her manager Rocky for handling some drama."}
{"text":"Great family fun but a little expensive unless you have one of their coupons. The facility is nice and clean. The only bowling alley in Surprise."}
{"text":"I don't expect a perfect experience everywhere all the time, because things happen but.... The last few times we've come here, there seems to be something off. Whether it's the service or the quality of the food. Today takes the cake though! Five people in our party and we ordered a small cheese pizza, two bacon burgers one plain cheese burger and one \"stuffed\" burger. All four burgers arrived approximately 20 minutes later without the pizza. I grabbed my burger and cut it to see how they stuffed it. It's not stuffed with green chiles, bacon and cream cheese as it's assumed (the way the menu reads) but It was layered on top. We asked about the pizza and you could tell the food expediter had no idea what we were talking about. After she left to check on the pizza I took a bite and noticed mine was cold, all of them were but the other three were starving so ate it any way. Mine was truly cooked perfectly but none the less, cold. The server arrived to tell us she had no idea what happened with the pizza, she was very nice and immediately apologized taking my food back to the kitchen. Approximately 15 minutes later she arrived with what I assumed was a new burger I noticed the bun had been cut and I thought it was weird that this one was but not the previous. I grabbed the bun and you could tell they microwaved it because it was so hot, it was hard to hold on to. Still not stuffed, and this one was over cooked but I did eat one side. As I grabbed the second side I couldn't help but bust out laughing because they actually reused the meat I already had taken a bite out of, they just gave me a new bun. I immediately asked for the manager and a gentleman named Jack came over. Jack was very professional and just as flabbergasted as I was. He apologized profusely and said he really didn't know what else to say. I exclaimed, it's so ridiculous you can't help but laugh. Jack took all four burgers off our bill and kept saying he doesn't know what he could say to make it better. So I say to you, Mr. Red Embers Kitchen Manager, the only reason we'll return is because of the customer service given to us  by Jack after that food debacle."}
{"text":"As far as Surprise is concerned this is your best bet for a fun day out with the Fam close by. Decent food, full bar, bowling, arcade games and laser tag so you have something for everybody. 

The service is hit or miss so don't expect much there. Kids can cash in tickets for prizes and there's a decent amount of games to play. The seperate set of bowling lanes inside the bar area are nice for a more upscale vibe and environment. 

If I didn't live in or near surprise I wouldnt drive out to visit this location. However, since I do I live near by im definitely glad it's out here."}
{"text":"The whole setting of this bowling alley is awesome, but the employees are rude and don't have manners. We were there on a Sunday night and we went up to the bar to order a drink. My husband asked for a pitcher of beer and the bartender with spiky hair said with a rude tone of voice that they didn't have pitchers there. He made us feel very uncomfortable. After we got our beers we went to go bowl. We asked for service so we could order something to eat and we waited around 20 minutes and nobody came to help us, so we decided to leave. As we were leaving my husband saw that there was a laser tag so we were going to go check it out and automatically the girl that was working there by all the prices yelled at us and said we couldn't go in there since there was a game going on. This was our first time here so we didn't know how things worked. We had heard good things about this place, but our experience was horrible! We definitely won't be coming back again."}
{"text":"I have to say, the game room is pretty fun, could be more spacious with more games, like DDR or something. The food at Ember Grill was horrifying. Spent way too much money for a bad pizza. I have no yet tried bowling. The only  reason why I am giving this 3/5 is that it is pretty fun to take kids to the game area. That's about it."}
{"text":"Poor service. Poor service.. Poor service. Food is so so..
Need to conduct some serious training here."}
{"text":"Okay. Being in town yet again for Spring Training. For a third year in a row. Uptown Alley is a destination in Surprise after a Padres vs Ranger game. The first two times were fun memorable times. This time, memorable but not too fun. Let me retell my tale.
We get to the place to find out that there was a two hour wait to bowl. Which isn't in itself the worst thing in the world. We can go into the restaurant/bar and have drinks and eat a good meal. Problem solved. Hmmm...no, not really. More like a problem starting to develop.
With no hostess in sight. Not sure if she was on break, taking care of an customer issue or whatever else. We sat our nine person party ourselves; our party consisting of seven adults and two minors. Then the waiting game continued. Which was part our fault I have to admit.
Flagging down a few employees. The employees said that they would get someone to serve us. This however became somewhat of a joke after a few more moments. Finally we get the restaurant/bar manager to serve us herself.
Let me first to say. I also run a business that serves customers; so I know how trying it is to serve a lot of people at the same time. So our group and I cut her some slack.
I wish the problems stopped there though. They didn't. I ordered a coke and water but didn't get a coke until my food came. I resorted to drinking my wife's soda in the meantime.
My food didn't come for at least thirty minutes. Ten mango habanero hot wings, six small celery sticks plus a side of blue cheese. Thirty long minutes. But that isn't the kicker. My wings weren't deep fried in a fryer. I believe they were microwaved; and they came to the table COLD. Hot wings aren't hot wings if they are cold. Let me repeat. I waited thirty minutes for cold hot wings. Oxymoron!!!
Sending them back. I got another ten wings ten minutes later. I am guessing the same wings I sent back plus one new one. This time they were warm. Not cold but not hot...warm (sigh). Being real hungry at this point. I tried my best to eat them. I couldn't get past five. They were bad. As of this review. I have been up since 4 am with the worst heartburn. Thanks to five mango habanero  WARM wings. After eating, we decided to just leave. No bowling. No video games. No anything else. We were done as a group.
Let me end with this. The lady manager was a nice lady doing her best. The only reason I am giving any stars. I also didn't have to pay for the wings. She took it off the final bill. 
This however needs to be a wake up call for management to really look at their operation to succeed in the future. It will take a lot for me to ever come back here. It was a disappointing experience for sure. If you continue down this path. If you piss too many people off. You won't have a business to run at all."}
{"text":"Their management sucks ! And the employees are not well informed ! I called to see how old the guardians of younger children had to be and they said 21 I get there all the way from 30th Ave and  when I get there they don't let my family and I in on my birthday ! They need to train their employees better!!"}
{"text":"Great evening out with adults or parties. We love going with our kids the food is great!"}
{"text":"Day shift manager on 5/6/2017 said they would not honor the yelp 20% off coupon. It's a nice, well kept, facility but food delivieries are slow and they are much more expensive than  other alleys in the west valley. If you're going with a big group definitely check elsewhere because it may be worth the travel."}
{"text":"Hi. Was visiting from out of town. First of all the \"waitress\" forgot about Us for almost one complete game. They did finally remember us. Then, the \"waitress\" accidentally charged our card 300 dollars instead of 30 dollars. They said they corrected it, but it will take a days to have it back on the account. The manager at my request came and spoke with us, but didn't offer any compensation, just that if there any issues they would take care of it. We were having a great time and it was our last night in town. It's kinda put a damper on the evening. Very disappointed and do not recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"Best bowling in the Valley

Went bowling with my wife and little girls on a Sunday.  Uptown was very busy and we had a 1.5 hour wait.  But, it timed well for us to hit dinner before a couple games and worked out.

Staff is very nice, but seems to struggle with the rush of people constantly hitting them. Some management structure and training would go a long way toward helping them provide a better overall customer experience-- have multiple register running instead of three people figuring out how to charge a bill; not having people run back and forth from register to shoes; check-in station instead of mixing bowling/paying and check-in flows; et al.  But, at least they try to be as pleasant as possible.

The fourth star comes from having a clean, fun, youth-friendly setting.  There truly is no better bowling experience around.  The game and laser tag areas are also cool.  

Visiting Uptown makes for a family-friendly excursion.  Games, frames, and A/C on a hot weekend.  Some minor improvements an they could start averaging four to five stars."}
{"text":"Games are awesome! Customer service in game area awesome! Drinks awesome! Service and management in restaurant/ bar are horrible. Management/ lead in restaurant horrible and servers need to be trained. Be prepared to wait and only see your server 3 times. Don't go for food at all go for bowling and games!"}
{"text":"I came here for my work Christmas party and it was really fun! We had the back room with a buffet, bar, and mini bowling alley. The drinks were good as well as the food! I like the dark atmosphere with neon lights. It made the lanes look awesome! The seating was also very comfortable."}
{"text":"This is going to be long but worth the read..
This was my very first time coming to this place and man was I extremely diassapointed. I drove an hour to get here for fun with family just before my birthday. We had a group of 7 people and 3 kids, so we spent a lot of money at this place. Apon arriving, the front counter for bowling was nice and got us everything and set up with our lane. We got to our lane and my sister had just picked up a menu and opened it when I turned and noticed the waitress was standing accross the table staring at her impatiently and annoyed waiting for her to order a drink. I had to mentally question who this person was at first until I realized it was our waitress because she didn't say hi, she didn't introduce herself or say anything except does anyone else want anything to my sister not even asking the other people in my group.
When she came back with the drinks and the first snack my friend ordered, my friend said this doesn't look or taste like it states in the menu. There was supposed to be avocado and chicken, there clearly wasn't and there was peppers in it which was not in the description. The waitress kept coming back with well it's all in there, not asking if they would like to try something else or have them remake it. 
A bit later, we all ordered food. Everything came out about 15-20 minutes later at the same time. I ordered the Cajun chicken pasta, and it was not cheap. When I got it, it looked and even tasted like a tv dinner. I told the waitress i didn't like it and asked if i could get something else. She took the plate, slammed it on the table and said what's wrong with it. I said it tastes like a tv dinner, she said what else do you want. Meanwhile with an attitude and rolling her eyes. She brought my new food, and my sister had recieved a drink that tasted like cough medicine, i thought the same thing. When i asked the waitress for a different because that one was not good, she didn't say a word, took the drink, rolled her eyes and walked away. I sarcastically said thank you and she snarkely said your welcome while walking away. 
After all of that, I saw her talking to employees and they were looking in my direction and laughing. You can't know for sure that they are talking about you, but you can definately feel the energy and vibe from that.

After everything, I asked to speak to a manager, and he came out and when i told him everything he was very apologetic and was asking what he could do to make it better. He offered compensation in some way. 
The only reason this doesn't have one star is because the manager was nice and helpful. I am going to give it one more chance and will write a review for how my second visit goes."}
{"text":"OK, So I have been here 5 times in the last week and a half so I have an update.

Service can improve here.  I did have different customer service from everyone wanting to help to asking several employees to take my order.  

I do enjoy going here, but after seeing the vast variance in customer service I hope everyone that goes here gets the great service all the time.  Great service was when everyone asked if we needed anything, checking back with us throughout are meal, etc.  Different employees, even management checking in and making sure we are enjoying our food and drinks.  

When someone gets the poor service I got I would assume they would not come back here.  I noted 10 minutes before I had to get up and ask for someone to take my order.  I then had to wait another 10 minutes before someone actually helping my group of 6 customers.  It was busy, but I think just acknowledgment makes a difference.  

So between those 2 extremes I hope Uptown Alley can manage a consistant level of customer service.  I did watch several groups of people walk out of the open seating area once they were at that waiting threshold.  Once they noticed no one was going to take their orders they left, loss of business and maybe future business?

I really want Uptown Alley to do well since it is my neighborhood bar, restaurant, entertainment location.  

If you visit uptown Alley please ask for someone to take your order if you are sitting for a while with no help.  The food and drinks are good so please try them before leaving.

Hopefully you come when service is excellent and everyone is asking you how your food and drinks are :)"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my visit here. My girl and I came here to bowl. We played a couple of rounds and had a great time. This place is clean and the staff does a good job providing good customer service. Good location, too."}
{"text":"I'll give it 4 mainly because it provides a fun place for both kids and adults in Surprise that has been sorely needed.  

Went with my 7 & 9 year olds today.   We didn't get to do \"everything\" there because it gets pricey really fast.  That would be my chief complaint, but again, it's the only game in town like this and I am sure the owners know that.

Bowling - was great fun, excellent waitress service right at your lane where you can order food and eat it there.  $4 per person for each game, no discounts for kids (major dislike on that), $3.50 per person for shoes.  

Laser tag is $7 per person on weekends and $5 during the week.  So another $21 for the three of us on top of the $22.50 for bowling.

Arcade is fairly small and you buy tokens that are on a credit card type thing the kids swipe in each game.  It amounts to each game being between $1-$2.50 to play.  This is really price compared to other places like this, and as someone else mentioned the \"prizes\" at the end of the rainbow with the tickets you get out of the games take way to many and does disappoint.

The restaurant when you come in looks great for watching games.  There is a HUGE screen on one end - we did not eat in there so I can't say much else on it so far.  Same with the over 21 area, although it does look fun and I hope to go back without the kids in the evening sometime.

For some reason there were two uniformed Surprise police officers standing guard in a couple different places inside.  This was odd in my opinion given the clientele on a Sunday afternoon in this area.

Overall we'll be back as a family and I intend to check it out during grown ups time as well.   Just hope the prices don't turn it into a place you have to save up to go as opposed to a casual neighborhood spot to go on any given weekend."}
{"text":"I've been visiting my in-laws here in Surprise for about 12 years now and it doesn't cease to amaze me how much it's grown.

Now that I have kiddies in tow a place like Uptown Alley is definitely welcomed. My first visit was mid-week and right when it opened so it wasn't busy at all and everything was clean and refreshed and service was on point and friendly.

People of Surprise, I don't think ya'll know how spoiled you are with a modern facility like this. I'm from SF but live in HI and believe it or not but a clean, updated, kid friendly and affordable bowling alley with good food and drinks is non-existent in SF and Hawaii. All the bowling alleys are OLD and pricey.  And with the exception of Aiea Bowl (Shout out to Alley Restaurant!) the food is always mediocre. 

This place has automatic scoring and bumper guards that pop up when a kid comes up to bowl!  So then you don't have to get a kids only lane, both kids and adults can bowl at the same time! Sweeeeeet!

I even came back a second time to watch a Niner game as the amount and sizes of TVs in this place are impressive. It was really busy in the bar areas but the service was still good. At any rate bummers others don't like Uptown Alley as much as me, but then again you don't know what you have until you just don't have it! My recap:

Pros:
-Something for everyone: A small lounge area with TVs, a big sports bar area with massive screen and tvs all around, private rooms, small arcade area (which our 3-5 year olds enjoyed). 
-The automatic bumper guards that pop up for every kid that bowled! Sold!
-Really good chips and salsa
-Affordable (well to this Californian Hawaiian it is)
-Lot's of promo nights, like kids bowl free, $2 games etc etc.


Cons:
-Non that I can think of really. Maybe I'll come here on a Friday night or when a band is playing, so it's super busy and I can get irriated like other people. NOT. lol...."}
{"text":"I had dinner during happy hour tonight and it was really good (margherita pizza). Everyone in my party seemed to really enjoy their food. We were in a large party and the servers were all very friendly as well. I'm looking forward to returning soon for some bowling with my family."}
{"text":"Horrible!! If this is all Surprise has for kids to do, they need to rethink the future! The laser tag is too small, too many little, little kids get put into groups with bigger kids. Tooooooo much liquor, more to life than drinking. The hotesses are to busy chatting with themselves, or their pals who happen to come in. The bowling is expensive for what it is. (We don't want to help pay your lease). Birthday party's are too expensive for more than a couple of kids. Can't bring your own \"Gluten\" free anything, no snacks for diabetics in the building allowed as carry in, it's ridiculous."}
{"text":"Worst bowling alley I've ever been to.  I've been here an hour an a half and I'm still waiting to bowl.  Meanwhile they have 8 lanes have said reserved for a party for the last hour.  I could have bowled 3 times over."}
{"text":"Went yesterday to uta and it was great Ryan G, helped us a lot and had great customer service and he even provided us the deal the company offers for laser tag don't.really remember it. But all in all he made it a great experiences for me and my brother and his girlfriend, I well definitely be going back soon because of his services"}
{"text":"Stopped in here from Vegas  to Tucson, had dinner and a couple of drinks which were great . A big Ol Hawaiian bar tender helped us. He was very helpful, and friendly!! If you ever stop in have him make you his specialty drink!! I think his name was Dave . The reason why I gave this place 4 out 5 stars was because , I saw the manager treat one of the employees bad in front customers. You can clearly see he is a boss , not a leader!!! Other than that great place!!!"}
{"text":"Claudia is an amazing bartender! She was attentive to all our needs and was never rude. She was on point with our drink orders. I would recommend Claudia to anyone looking to have a drink and a good time at uptown ally. If it wasn't for Claudia,  I wouldn't even come to the place. Good job uptown ally for hiring such an outstanding individuals!"}
{"text":"Great place to catch happy hour and have a few drinks in a fun environment. Food is pretty good and during the daytime the place is pretty empty."}
{"text":"This is a cool bowling alley with a bar, large game area, live music, restaurant, large TVs and laser tag I think? Games are reasonably priced. I think I paid $30 for unlimited amount of games in an hour or so? Don't even know if that's saving a lot of money if even any but I'll go with it! Only sucky thing is if you're bowling, it takes forever to order drinks and to get them!"}
{"text":"do not have your kids birthday party here...... customer service sucks....couldn't find anyone to help and when I did they seemed bothered. No place to open gifts, there was an empty meeting room adjacent to out 3 lanes, when we tried to open the gifts there we were kicked out and the door locked, our party was inconvenienced by having to open gifts on the lanes with a locked empty room 5 feet away, pretty crappy way to treat a party that paid well over $500 for a 9 year olds bday party"}
{"text":"Give this man TYLER HALL a raise. Personable, funny, and ready to help clients. Thank you for your hard work. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times, and while I admit it is fun there are a lot of flaws.

First off, it's pretty pricey, if I recall correctly a single beer is like $10 or something like that, don't quote me on that exact price though.

Second of all, the service is lackluster. multiple times now, my friends and I would sit around waiting for our server and they never come. We would go out of our way to find a server and can't find ours, so we just ask the next one we see and they say they're not our server. Also, I've gone to the bar to get water before and the bartender says that our server will get it for us instead of taking 5 extra seconds to fill a cup up with water and handing it to us right there and then.

Overall, I am pretty unhappy with the service I have received here. These occurrences have happened on multiple occasions."}
{"text":"The place was fun with plenty of activities to get into. Def makes up for not having a Dave and Buster's in the west valley. The nachos with salsa and turkey with avocado sandwich could've been better but it also could've been worse. The drinks at the bar and the bar tender provided great service. I would recommend to try at least once and see for yourself."}
{"text":"Its crazy to rate this place just on \"Uptown Alley\" because there are so many different aspects to this amazing place! :) 

1. Bowling Alley: Love it! They have an \"Adult: section to bowl in with its own bar that you can also rent out for parties. Its amazing. Also have bowled in the big lanes and have always had a blast. All the staff is very friendly and service is good except the drink and food service was a bit slow. 

2. Red Embers: Really liked the place. Outside seating with some nice fireplaces for ambience. Inside is noisy no matter where you sit because its right across from the kids arcade. Food was decent, service was good but we were sitting at the bar.

3 Lazer Tag: Its lazer tag! It has an upstairs and downstairs. Lots of kids and also adults playing. Awesome thing about the lazer tag is if you get hit your not out! It takes about a minute before your gun and vest recharge and you get to keep playing. They have teams . Red and blue. On your lazer gun is your \"team name\". Mine was Falcon.. after the time is up you can look on the big screen outside for your \"team\" name and see how good you did against everybody that was in the game. also see if red or blue team won. We had a blast!

4. Arcade: Pretty good selection of games. Kind of reminds me of what they have at Peter Piper.

5. Karoke: Seems like everytime Im there they have Karaoke or some kind of band. It happens right in the midst of everything! Its like this little stage that overlooks the bowling lanes, arcade and one of the bars.. lol.. Ya, Its pretty entertaining

All in all I love this place. They do have security everywhere but they have always been super cool. Always have a great time here whatever we are doing."}
{"text":"The bowling was awesome the atmosphere was great but one thing that made my family's experience here perfect was our server Renee. She was very interactive with us as guests and even showed off some of her dance moves ! If you go on Wednesday nights ask for her, I know we always will!"}
{"text":"Ah, I both love and hate this place.

This type of entertainment was much needed in the surprise/el mirage area. So expect a wait. 

Great place to go with friends not so much for a family on a budget. Bowling is expensive, food is expensive and I  think the arcade has room for improvement. 
If you bring kids and your bowling game goes past 10 expect an employee to stand there waiting not so patiently for your game to end, so they can remind that kids aren't allowed past a certain time. 

They should really offer families of 5+ special prices without the option of having to call ahead and create a \"party event\". 

Otherwise just going with friends for a night out is good and fun and seriously laser tag... Is awesome"}
{"text":"My department recently held a meeting and team-building event at Uptown Alley. From first contact, the Sales Director was extremely patient and accommodating. She was very personally involved in planning our event and responded to all email and phone-calls promptly.

As for the venue....wow! The service was excellent, and the hospitality exceptional. We started our meeting when the facility opened, but they were already set-up and ready for us. Lunch was served right on time, and the quality and portion size was surprisingly good for the price. Even though there weren't many people on the lanes, the banquet room was a little loud, but still not unbearable.

Once we moved to the lanes for the Teambuilding Part of the morning, they already had our names loaded and our shoes staged at the appropriate lanes!

This is an unbelievably enormous place, with something for everyone. 

My personal thanks to Ashley, Becca, Chris, Patrick, and Martha; you guys did an awesome job and we'll definitely encourage our other departments to use your venue for their next outing!"}
{"text":"Great place!!! Took my son here for his 7th birthday and he had a blast! Friendly staff, the place was very clean!!! Laser tag was awesome I think that was his favorite part! Food was well priced! We recommend friends family anyone who wants to have a good time to this location!"}
{"text":"Been frequenting uptown alley for about two years now. Service is usually pretty decent, but tonight it is terrible. How terrible you ask? Enough for me to write a review. The dining area, as always, had great service but the bowling area was terrible. Waited at the bar for 3 minutes with no one show up. Made it all the way to the 7th frame and my friend flagged a waitress down. I gave her my order and she asked who was my waitress. I said no one. Smh. I'll most likely be back cause I'm not driving all the way to main event. They win by default tonight.leta see how long my order takes to come out tonight"}
{"text":"Nothing says it's the holidays like a long wait so you can enjoy terrible service! Empty glasses on the table and service help that's too busy talking to each other does not equal a big tip!"}
{"text":"awful management - rude to their emplyees in front of customers.  was greeted by a pitete friendly and smiley lady who was fantasticly helpful.  later saw \"management\" yelling at her for no reason other than apparent power /ego trip.  if they continue to treat their workers this way - they'll loose the good ones and the place will go outta business quickly.  also, refuse to allow customers to bring in water! this is AZ- one can dehydrate... just wanna make an extra buck off poor customer at this overpriced fad."}
{"text":"Well, we've been coming here countless times, it's super close to our house, in fact we can just walk our way if we want to exercise! LOL. Both my hubby and I are not really into \"sports\" , well I mean I love to watch basketball or boxing...let me give you a clue if what country I am from? Manny Pacquiao is the country's  boxing legend! hehe 
I am from the Philippines So those two sports are mainly the nation's fave! I'm an avid fan, I watch
BUT I don't play! LOL. ^_^
It's so happened that my hubby is the same, I mean he would watch if it's Pacquiao or Mc. Gregor's fight! and that's about it! haha
If there's one sport, that we both would play...it's BOWLING! Like what I said, we are NOT sporty, but if invited by a friend or when we feel like it..bowling is the ONLY sports we would dare to play! We are both 
\"trying harders\"! LOL But, you'll be surprised, 
we can absolutely do \"STRIKES\"!!! Oh yeah! haha 
I'm telling you, don't dare us! hehe we may not be PROS but if challenged to give our best shot, we might beat you! ROFL! ^_^
Okay, let's focus on this place's review hehe, uhhmm it's  a fun place to go...that's why I'm giving them 5 stars. I am not hard to please guys! Give me good service and a place that's worth not just the money but a time enjoyably spent, then I'll definitely flatter you! haha
This place never fails my expectations. Good place to hangout. We don't drink, just soda and juice haha... I don't mind the crowd, it makes it more fun! 
The food is always good, and I love the lively spirit too especially the music that always makes me wanna dance while playing! LOL.
Keep it up guys!!! We'll definitely would come back!"}
{"text":"The facilities are nice but the service continues to be horrendous. Last week, my wife and I bowled in the 22 and over section. The waitress came and got our order and, to start, we asked for an iced tea and a club soda. If you live in the area you know that the water here tastes terrible unless you filter it. I am not sure whether the water is not filtered here or if perhaps the water in the ice machine isn't but the club soda was terrible. I waited for the waitress to come back to ask for something different and after 40 minutes I walked to the bar and did it myself. Prior to bowling we ate at their restaurant; the food was pretty good but again, the service lacked. In this case the problem is the staffing, or lack there of. We were told that we would have a 15-20 wait when there were over 10 tables open. Luckily the manager approached the hostess and had us seated but something was said about creating a longer wait time for the following customers because they didn't have enough servers. This experience is not my first one like this, in fact it seems to be the norm, unfortunately. In the last 3 months I bowled by myself in the afternoon. Both times I was given a lane inside the 21+ area and was given the name of the server. Both times I made my first game last about 30 minutes as I waited for her. I started the second game and... You guessed it; I finished it without anyone ever coming over to see if I needed anything. There were 2 other parties there as well in both occasions and nobody received any service. To the management: WAKE UP!!!! Your lack of leadership and ability to keep your establishment staffed properly, apparently based on poor pay and employee treatment (based on comments made  by some of you current and ex members of your team). Perhaps you rely on the fact that you are the only place of this kind in the area but from now on, I am driving somewhere else."}
{"text":"This place is okay if this is your thing. It reminds me of those big game rooms they have in Laughlin or Vegas for the kiddies to enjoy while parent gamble. At this place they do have an over 21 Room but it was booked for a private party last night. Instead, we played darts and watched the hockey game in the mini lounge. 

They have pool tables, darts, game room, Laser tag, and bowling. They have a bar and a restaurant. 

I gave this three stars instead of four for a specific reason. I was highly annoyed at the bar. After standing there for 15 minutes I was pretty much ignored for about ten minutes. I was then overcharged for an already overpriced too expensive drink. Then to top it off, the drink had no alcohol in it. ( Or very little) and the glass was only 3/4 filled. The bathroom was just ridiculously disgusting. No soap, the water did not work in any of the spouts and no TP. It was so dirty."}
