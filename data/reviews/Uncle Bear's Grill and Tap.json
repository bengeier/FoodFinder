{"text":"Went here for happy hour. Reasonable prices. Hilarious karaoke. And pretty good food. Just a laid back fun environment. Service was great too. Very friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Mandarin Wheat beer tasted like baby aspirin. The karaoke DJ was a complete jerk. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Great place. Love the dog pics. Comfortable and spacious, no stuffy \"bar\" atmosphere. Service is top notch and the food is not \"Bar food\" by any stretch, it's way better. Lauren was very helpful and personable."}
{"text":"Good fried food, the chicken sliders are awesome. I don't like looking at dogs and dog food when I eat. And I also think it doesn't smell like a restaurant. When you walk in, you can't smell food! That sounds strange, but it really does kind of bother me..."}
{"text":"Great group of people. Really good prime rib sliders. Love the black and bleu burger. Kids love throwing peanuts on ground"}
{"text":"First time here I had the blue cheese burger sliders. Deelish! Service was great, fun, relaxed atmosphere. I will come back."}
{"text":"Beer was decent. That about the only good thing I can say about this place. A friend and I sat at the bar, bartender was quick to get us drinks and that's About the extent of his serving skills. He took our order, a different person ran the food, that's fine. However, our food was wrong and I never got the water I ordered. The bartender checked on the guys next to me about 4 time to refill beers and see how they were doing but did not say a word to me. Did not even check to see how we were doing.Maybe they were regulars but that in no way justifies giving crappy service to a first timer. The only way I could get his attention was to finish my beer and THEN, he ask if we needed another round. Needless to say I declined and got the hell out of there."}
{"text":"Ryan made us feel as if we were drinking in our own backyard. He was funny, fun, and attentive. We will be going back and we hope Ryan is working when we return!"}
{"text":"I truly believe in the three strikes and you're out method of picking restaurants. This place is now out. The service is bad, slow and without the necessary help. Two of the visits I asked for something after the food was delivered incorrectly and they forgot, so I had to ask twice. Two of the visits there were flies around our table. The pizza was undercooked and drink refills were not happening. Not a place I will go to again.

Oh and the real gross out, the Tshirts hanging in the restaurant are so dusty, they look furry...between the flies and the shirts...yuck."}
{"text":"Ryan at the bar is awesome! Best customer service you could ask for. I sit at the bar so he is our server!"}
{"text":"Great place to chill and have some quality brews and tasty food.  Always courtious staff. Good vibe atmosphere.   Fish tacos and prime rib sliders rock."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my most favorite restaurants! The food is wonderful, my fav is the veggie tacos...to die for!!  What kept me coming back was that all of the walls are covered with fun pictures of all breeds of dogs...a dog lovers heaven!!!"}
{"text":"Out in the middle of no where, but such a fantastic find!

Went here for a few drinks with some sorority sisters before heading out to a festival in Queen Creek. Did a little research on the place and knew I was going to love the overall dog theme. 

They have outstanding happy hour special everyday of the week. Wish I loved closer so I could bring my dog to the very dog-friendly patio and enjoy a game on the many flat screens. Inside, there's tons of booth and the walls are simply lined with framed photos of dogs. It's hilarious. What's even better is they let you throw peanut shells all over the floor and the peanuts are hed in dog bowls. Love it.

Didn't order food but they had an outstanding selection of drinks. I would def go back to this place."}
{"text":"Came today with my wife, friends and our two pups and the experience was great. food was great, beer was great, even brought our fur little ones some treats and water.. definitely coming back"}
{"text":"I've been to the one off of Germann which was fine, except I was served a beer in a broken glass that had a shard sticking out... no big deal right?? Anyways so we tried this location, we didn't even make it inside. It smelt like a fish hatchery. WTF? I've been to places that have a big fish fry (idk if that's even what was going on) but I have never walked into a restaurant that remotely smelled the way this place did. It was so unappetizing. We promptly closed the door and left..."}
{"text":"Another great meal with great service
Love these burgers,atmosphere lots of fun 
All the dog photos are fun"}
{"text":"Highly recommend! Excellent food and excellent wait-staff. Must try the Dog Park Dark Ale. Dogs are welcome on the patio."}
{"text":"Uncle Bear's is a kitchsy, theme restaurant with an outdated peanuts and sawdust decor. They are dog-friendly, which is nice. While the menu emphasizes pizza and wings, I like their salads - lots of leafy greens, shredded cheese, and grilled chicken. The craft beer is great. I'm giving it four stars because, despite the negatives, they are the best place in the area in terms of food quality, choices, and price, not to mention their beer menu."}
{"text":"The place was packed until happy hour ended and it cleared quickly. I had a sandwich and it was made on a hotdog bun with dry meat and what tasted like frozen onions and peppers. The place was very loud with just OK service. There are many good restaurants' in the area and no reason to return to Uncle Bears."}
{"text":"$60 our the door for two people to eat - 1 domestic beer, 1 coke, 1 burger, chicken tacos and a pretzel. Pretty pricey for what you get. Friendly staff. Slower than average speed of service. Fun atmosphere if you like dogs and sports, but an average sports grill n bar type place. Fairly clean. The food was average. Overall, two stars for average food at above average prices. Simply put, it's just not worth it."}
{"text":"I go here all the time because it's within walking distance and I can bring my dogs on the patio.  I like the casual atmosphere with dog pics on the walls and peanuts in dog bowls.  But the food is only average.  Service on the patio is hit and miss - sometimes I think they forget we are out there.  Tends to be better when we eat inside.  And we have to deal with the smokers outside - wish they would designate half the patio for smoking and half for dogs.  I don't want my dogs laying in cigarette butts."}
{"text":"What a great experience. The BLT was on point and the coleslaw was fantastic. My husbands chicken wings were perfect. The best service and so friendly here!! Will diffidently come back for more fun! THE BEER IS GREAT !!"}
{"text":"The food is good especially since they re-did the menu but nothing I would go out of my way for. It's a decent place to go watch a game but I'm only giving it 3 stars because of the beer selection. They have a couple of your standard banquet beers and a rotating guest tap but other than that it's just their own brews......and they're TERRIBLE.  There's just no other way to put it. They taste like something out of a Mr. Beer kit that went wrong. Please please bring in more of a variety of craft beers. That and the always friendly service would easily warrant 4 or 5 stars from me."}
{"text":"I really wish there was a way to not give any stars as this place does not deserve any after my experience tonight. When we got to Uncle Bears there was no wait we got seated right at a table. After ordering our drinks we waited awhile before the waiter came by to take our order. My boyfriend ordered wings and a side of fries, our son (2 years old) got the hotdog and I ordered a chicken salad. NOT A HARD ORDER OR HARD TO MAKE. The table behind us was empty when we sat down and now there is a party of 2 behind us after we had already ordered. They received their appetizer and then there meal before we even received our food. We asked where it was and the waiters excuse was we are extremely busy. We then asked if they could rush my son's food. It came out cold. While trying to entertain my 2 year old during this wait we \"washed\" my son's hands with a baby wipe and then he decided he wanted to clean the table with it. The baby wipe was black by the time he was done with his cleaning of the table. We waited 40 minutes from the time we ordered to the time it was delivered and it wasn't even warm. The waiter never check on us while we waited for our food my soda and my boyfriend's beer was empty and never once was asked if we wanted a refill until after our food was delivered. When we asked for the manager he was behind the bar bartending and very rude when we told him what had happen"}
{"text":"I've ate here a few times, but stopped going in spite of it being so close to my home. The food (after trying a lot of different items, and appetizers like the roast beef sliders) just doesn't do it for me. I feel like most of the items on the menu are 'thaw and deep fry' frozen items, in spite of some of them actually being pretty good.  Service was hit or miss. Atmosphere is friendly,  Albeit a bit corny . Actually this place reminds me more of a sports bar as opposed to a bar and grill. For the prices paid, and food quality combined with a lower brow \"sports bar\" atmosphere... I'm just not impressed. You could get better ambience and food at a Friday's."}
{"text":"The staff does care about  your meal and everything is made usually as you order it.  Know you are going to be bad when you go there and don't count calories.  Burgers, wings and salads are good but you never crave.TVs are pretty good and you chuck your peanuts on the floor.  For a sports bar, this place is okay and I go there because its close to my house, but if another sports bar settled close by...buh bye. I'm just okay with it. They never change their menu and if you like wings...one time they will be very good. Next time. Meh. Glad you are listening. To eloborate further on changes to menu...French fries with burgers...you USED to have good steak fries and recent did away with them. The replacement are over salted grease sticks. I inquired with staff and they said you switched them because the steak fries took too long to cook and you couldn't get food out fast enough....there were about 4 tables going on plus me at the time he said this...AND he said I wasn't the only one disappointed with the change. My take? Get the cooks to time better. The wings...last time I was in...we're barely cooked and brought out...like dangerously hot with all the sauce on them dripped off and  melted at the bottom of the plate...and the spices were off cause of this and..had to ask for hot sauce...yet..still didn't do the trick. Hit and miss...lately just miss. Also..bring back San Tan brewery...stop trying to keep just your craft tap beers in house..Plus..last time I had one...it wasn't ice cold either. Tweak the Mesa location ah..please."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I found this place tonight and were more than pleasantly surprised. The food was great. Our bartender Angie was AWESOME! She Never missed a beat. GREAT SERVICE! We'll be back! Thanks Angie!"}
{"text":"The best thing about this restaurant is definitely all the pictures of dogs. The restaurant has a very cool theme!

I didn't care too much for the food though, although it was alright. And it didn't really seem to be worth the price, but in any case we had a good time dining here."}
{"text":"Great beer selection. Good bar/grill food especially when you're down a few drinks. The smell of sewage is sometimes  prominent inside the restaurant. Love the dog-friendly patio. Four stars for the love of local brewers!"}
{"text":"We have been going to Uncle Bears since the very first one opened in Gilbert. We use to talk to the owner (Todd) all the time even.  Not sure if he still owns the chain or not. 

That said; we ate at the Mesa location (Ellsworth/Baseline) last night, and I must say, it was a bit dissapointing.  Food took longer then usual to arrive, and the fries were cold.  The Fish & Chips which I use to rate the best were more like square fish sticks (like you can buy in the frozen section).  The worse was the Herd Chopped Beef burger. It was very dry, almost no onions and literally looked like they took 1-2 hamburger patties and tore them in to pieces.  I'm hoping this is just a Chef change that can be corrected, or we won't be stopping in here very much anymore. :(

The beer was still good....and cold."}
{"text":"Have never tried Uncle Bears before and me and my boyfriend wanted to try a new place near our house. We went in on a Thursday night, a little before 11. There was no hostess when we walked in so we just sat down at the bar. Immediately, the kitchen staff made eye contact with us as we sat down. A server cleaning tables saw us as well. No one was behind the bar, and as 5 minutes passed without us being greeted we were curious to as if we would ever be helped. 5 more minutes passed and still nothing so we decided to go to The Hub. Sad that we didn't get to try this place."}
{"text":"I have been in the service industry for many year, both as a hostess and a server. So needless to say I understand and respect the position these individuals are in. 

We came to Uncle Bears to watch the cardinals play. I was greeted by a not so friendly hostess. As I told her we have 8 people joining us, we would like to be seated next to tv's that would show the game. Her first reaction was \"8 people?\" Then proceeded I roll her eyes and scuff at the idea that she was going to have to move tables and accommodate a medium party under short constraints. Mind you it was not very busy at all with plenty of options to seat us. She sat us in a very awkward corner, with little viewing of tv's, and the ones we could see were out of range or at neck cranking heights. Like I said we came here solely to watch the game. After we were sat, fortunately our waitress, Kat I believe was her name, saved our experience. She changed certain tv's to the game and was very helpful with our party. She is a keeper, I wish I could say the same thing for the hostess!"}
{"text":"Challenged our ADA approved support animal for a family member suffering from PTSD.  Was even told since person is not \"handicapped\" we were not allowed inside.  However, @RedRobin , they were gracious and even offered a small bowl for water."}
{"text":"I like this place.
1. FREE Peanuts!!!
2. Good, simple menu.
3. Good beer selection including local beers!
4. Daily specials
5. Pictures of customer's dogs...EVERYWHERE!
6. Friendly Service.
7. Sliders!!!!!
8. Local Business.
9. Hockey Games!
10. FREE Peanuts!!!"}
{"text":"This place used to be so good. We received feedback from the manager which is nice but nothing ever changed. So upset as this used to be a go to place and is down the street. Very upset.....we used to take family, go there for date night, karaoke, games. Never again unfortunately."}
{"text":"Done,done,and done... I have been visiting Uncle Bears in Mesa for 8 years and today was the last straw.  Over the past year I have goton a pet so I sit outside at the patio Nice you would think NOT, never have they brought water to my pet I have to bring my own.  But that's not my issue the food has become gross, there is no longer one thing on the menu I care to go there to have....Today will be my last visit I stopped for a beer and some wings , they no longer carry 4 peaks, tried their new micro brew ,not for me ordered wings w/bl ch then decided to get them to go.... Arrived home under cooked wings ,tasteless and no bl ch and not even one napkin.  I'll be at the Hub from now on the food and staff are sooooo much better."}
{"text":"This place is a cool, they have outdoor seating as well as a reasonably large indoor restaurant area. The service was friendly and quick (granted they were not super busy at the time.) The decor is pretty cute, I mean who doesn't love cute doggie pictures!

Recommendations:
Cobb Salad - fresh greens, crispy bacon, avocado, boiled eggs, tomatoes with grilled chicken breast. (I opted for no bleu cheese crumbles.) *All the produce was fresh tasting and the chicken was cooked perfectly tender. 

Sizzling Fajita Salad - fresh greens, tomatoes, cheddar cheese and salsa topped with sizzling beef and sauteed onions. *If you go with the beef, order the temperature a little under what you normally would because the meat continues to cook when it's served.

I was pleasantly surprised that i liked this place as much as i did. This location is a little hidden but is a good neighborhood bar and grill."}
{"text":"Well....after driving 2100 miles cross country with three vehicles and I got the farting dog, we deserved a decent meal but couldn't leave the pup alone yet.  So we decided on take out - and Uncle Bear's was the closest we could find.  And not a bad find at that!

DS ordered the Asian Chicken salad. It had a nice amount of chicken tossed with Mandarin oranges and greens and a very tasty sesame dressing - not overly gingery like some.

DH got the Thai pasta with chicken and he licked the plate clean.  The peanut sauce was just kicky enough to add flavor but not enough to force him out with the farting dog.  Tossed with diced tomatoes and cilantro and loads of cashews.  Quite yummy.

We hit the trifecta with the Chicken Walnut salad.  Granted, I am a wuss and left off the avocado but, trust me, it was not missed. Lots of chicken and lots of walnuts and grapes.  But - and here was the crowning grace - the best raspberry vinagrette in town. Seriously good. It even had little bits of the berries in it.  I would go back again for just that!

Portions were quite nice sized. Prices reasonable. 

While picking up the food, I realized this is a truly dog-friendly restaurant - you can bring your pup and sit in the outside patio.  You can be sure that we will take the DP (dear pup) with us the next time and eat in - and help ourselves to a dogbowl of peanuts while we are there!"}
{"text":"Came in yesterday for lunch. It was pretty busy, but the customer service was outstanding! I've been to a bears out in QC and this one has the same feel. Lots of doggy pictures on the wall and peanuts on the floor. I ordered a grilled cheese - very tasty! For $10 it came with soup and salad too! Filling! 

The chips and queso and beer would make a great happy hour stop as well. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Absolute BEST pizza in town!!  Nice thin crust and HOT!  The pix of all the dogs, however, should be taken down and cleaned or don't put back up.  They are disgustingly dirty - all of them!"}
{"text":"My husband and I thought we would give this place a try yesterday since we were out in that direction and thought it looked cool online.  I ordered wings to start and then a plain chicken sandwich with cheese and fries for a meal.  Our server was very nice, but not very attentive.  We received our food two minutes after our appetizer came out.  When I went to pick up my sandwich the bread was soggy and the chicken was like rubber.  I let our server know and she took it back to get me a fresh sandwich.  When she came back, I had a chicken sandwich smothered in guacamole and bacon.  At this point I had waited for my food for over twenty minutes, my husband had finished his meal, we hadn't gotten refills on our drinks, and I was pretty frustrated.  I ate two bites of my sandwich and then paid the bill and left.  They did comp us the chicken sandwich on our bill which was very nice, but this won't be a place that we venture to again."}
{"text":"Today was the second or third time we've been to Uncle Bear's on Baseline and it'll be the last.  It gets 2 stars for the football games and the dog theme but that's it.  Ordered an iced tea with NO LEMON and it came with a huge lemon chunk sitting right there in the tea.  Clearly the server wasn't paying attention.  I asked for another tea with NO LEMON TOUCHING THE GLASS ANYWHERE.  She grabbed the first glass and huffed off and I was afraid to drink the second one.  When our food came, hubby said his tasted microwaved and was not very good.  My burger, partially wrapped in paper, was served on a dirty looking, disgusting wooden board with the unwrapped part of the burger sitting directly on the wood and the fries were piled directly on the wood as well...no paper or plate between the food and the wood.  That was a disgusting and unsanitary display, considering how porous wood is and it can never be properly cleaned.  I'm sure they thought it was quirky and hip but all I could think of was how filthy that thing looked.  I ate about 6 fries that were on top of the pile and not touching the wood and part of the burger was left as well.  Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Don't go here for the weekend. The red headed bar tender and blonde basic waitress will listen to their \"regulars\" over all others at their location. I went there with my friend for karaoke on a Friday night. I talked to the karaoke guy and his friend about my song, nothing but small talk. One guy got angry, looked me in the eye and said he's going to kick me out. I'm unsure what set him off.. but then he went to the main bartender and told her I slapped him. I went back in a week later. The bartender was extremely rude for no reason. I asked her for drink and she claimed I slapped one of her favorite customers. Afterwards we went to the hub and the bartender there told us to drive to Queen Creek's Uncle Bear instead of deal with the east mesa service. Can say it is absolutely worth the drive."}
{"text":"We used to love this place and still do. My husband used to get the pizza and wing combo and I want to say it was around $16 I ordered it last night and they said they don't do that promo anymore I ordered it anyways thinking it couldn't be more than a few bucks higher $25  won't be ordering that again it will definitely discourage me from going back"}
{"text":"I ordered the Cajun belly rub Burger and fries for dinner, burger was good not as spicy as I expected, but that didn't stop me from eating every messy bite and needing a belly rub after...  My daughter and her cousin split the BBQ wings appetizer and if sauce all over their hands isn't proof they enjoyed it, you should have seen their faces! It's a great family place for dinner. The girls loved the dog pictures everywhere and they especially loved eating peanuts from a dog dish and dropping the shells on the floor. Good atmosphere and service too!"}
{"text":"The hostess seated us immediately.  Our waitress was very accommodating and patient. The mild chicken is a little warm.  Mozzarella sticks are typical, good but a little greasy!  , We made it in time for happy hour  $2 off the appetizers.  Fun and comfortable environment with lots of dog pictures."}
{"text":"Great burgers, wife had the old fashioned, I had the schroom burger,
both were outstanding , great service and great atmosphere (casual)
We will be back."}
{"text":"Not the first choice in our book, more like an \"I guess so\" bar. 
Everything just looks and feels so dirty, granite you're in a bar with dog bowls filled with peanuts so I guess the expectations should be low. 
The food is nothing special and pretty bland.
The only reason we would really return is to watch karaoke."}
{"text":"I've tried a couple of things here (prime rib, hamburgers, queso, fried combo) and everything was just ok. Nothing special or great. They also give you peanuts in a plastic dog bowl and you drop the shells on the floor. 

This is a nice place to come and watch a game and chat with the friendly bartenders up at the bar. Cool neighborhood bar. They have live music here sometimes too, just can't remember which days. 

Love all the pics of the dogs around the restaurant. I keep forgetting to bring pics of my two pups."}
{"text":"We ate at Uncle Bears last night and were disappointed that they no longer have peanuts.   We realize there are people who have peanut allergies, but it was neat to have a cold beer and eat peanuts.  The food is always good, but this change will probably stop us from frequenting them as often as we use to.  I'm sure that not everyone feels the same about this as we do."}
{"text":"Uncle Bear's is a breath of fresh air! We were looking for something with a relaxed atmosphere and great fun food. We found it! I had the Chihuahua \"Charlie\" burger with sweet potato fries and a cup of their beer cheese soup. Excellent and a good start sized portion! The staff was also great; very attentive, but not overly smothering you. They have a huge selection from appetizers, soups, salads, burgers, sandwiches, pizza, tacos.. About anything you can be in the mood for. The atmosphere was entertaining! Pictures of so many doggies, sports decor and TVs everywhere you looked. It's also dog friendly! Great food, service, and atmosphere - we will be back!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I went there on a Saturday night.  Megan got a hamburger, and it was very good.  Fries were good, service was good.  My prime rib sandwich on the other hand, was way overdone.  Like a piece of roast beef that had been boiled for a long time.  Overdone, dry, brown.  Only thing that saved this sandwich was the mediocre horse radish.  Otherwise it would have been like chewing on old shoe leather with no taste.  So I split the difference between the two sandwiches.  4 for Megan's hamburger, 1 for my sandwich, and 3 for the service...rounds out to a 3 in my little head."}
{"text":"Well...  I stopped by this restaurant to meet a friend I haven't seen since my days in the Air Force about 29 years ago.  The restaurant was neat and the staff was friendly.  I ordered the grilled turkey sandwich. It was great.  The waitress was on it.  Two thumbs up for the food, service and cleanliness of this restaurant."}
{"text":"It has a cute atmosphere with all the dog photos and dog related stuff, but the food is pretty meh. Dont try the bombers... I think theyre just a couple shots of their cheapest alcohol mixed with kool aid"}
{"text":"When ever my husband and I have a day off we always end up here, food is great(wings better then BWW and Native by far) and they remember us and what we like to drink, easy to talk to bartenders. We like KIM! Thinks she's mid shifts during the week"}
{"text":"Dunno if I can really comment on the longterm vibe of this place, but for a fella who was invited out for a night of karaoke with pals it certainly fit the bill. It was just the ticket. It was what you wanted.

First off, it's in a strip mall there on Baseline. I always get thrown for a loop when I see a bar in a strip mall, but it's really neither here nor there. No matter the setting, there are certain things I want from my neighborhood bar and grill. First off, it's gotta have a menu full of stuff. I know that sounds terribly generic, but you've got to go in with no real hankering in mind, paw through a bunch of stuff, point to something, and then have them bring it to you. It's so nondescript, it's specific. 

Uncle Bear's has a menu full of the aforementioned stuff. The pizza. The burgers. The wings. The hot dogs. It's all perfectly available and was served up quick. I had a loose burger with fries and also tried the bbq chicken pizza. Bar food at its finest. Warmed up those pipes for karaoke. 

On the subject of service, or guy took care of business. There was a big table full of us folks, and he was there to refill drinks and get food shuttled around. 

One of the other great needs of a neighborhood bar & grill is the gimmick, and they've got that in spayeds. (I know it's really \"spades\" but if you read on, you'll definitely praise my pun...). Dog bowls for the peanuts, doggy pics all over the wall, and a dog mascot. It's an ode to the K9. Nice touch. Perfect.

I had a nice night of belting tunes and dancing like an idiot. It's not about the food, or the service, or the ambiance, it's really about all of that in a convenient package."}
{"text":"Good news the food is ok at best but the service isn't that good unfortunately for me it's the only bar on the neighborhood so limited choice anyone coming in good luck give it a try I hope it's better for you"}
{"text":"Man, this is MY restaurant. I love their cheese fries and huge pretzel. I am done with meat & dairy as I am fighting a slow growing (something else will kill me 1st) cancer, but why feed it. But my wife and our friends love their sliders & chicken quesadillas. They have a great menu!!! Love this place."}
{"text":"This bar is in our neighborhood, we have been going there for years. The food and service has been on a steady decline. We went there the other night and had a horrible experience. The bartender is rude and not a friendly person. When we asked to speak to a manager he said he was the manager!  How can you have someone so rude be the manager in a service industry?  We won't support this business anymore. Go to any other place but this one it awful."}
{"text":"Went here tonight after a long day of moving. All I wanted was a cold craft beer and wings. They didn't disappoint. I got the garlic Parmesan wings and they were great. Also had a side salad and Some fries. I love the fact that you can get a nice salad for under $3.00. Most places want to charge you $8.00 for a little bowl of lettuce. Salad was served at room temperature.  I wasn't happy about that but oh well. Nobody is perfect."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite neigborhood joints, I live a mile away and can ride the bike over anytime.  The meatball sandwich is the best item on the menu, and they have a good beer selection.  Golden tee and peanuts allow you to hang out for hours."}
{"text":"Yea, got home and the order was wrong. Called and the manager told me I ordered incorrectly. I NEVER said sliders I said sandwich. What a jerk"}
{"text":"Had the fajitas there.  They were tasteless.  Just some meat on tortillas with absolutely no seasoning.  Plus, the waiter was too busy texting to bring us our check.  We had to go and get it from him.  Never got the coke we ordered either and there were only a couple of people in the restaurant at the time.  Won't go back."}
{"text":"Great service.   Great food.  I love their Green Chili Burger. Great choice of beers."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch. I sat at the bar for no lie 5 minutes watching the bartender on her phone texting or whatever. I finally had to speak up and ask for a beer. Same when it came to ordering lunch. I literally live across the street from Fat Wiley's but come here because of their beers and service. Well the beers have not changed in a while and Princess is more into her phone then taking care of her Customers. I didn't even get my rewards card stamped because I know I won't be back."}
{"text":"Great service!!! And Good food! Always enjoy the food and love all the pictures of dogs everywhere."}
{"text":"Ordered a salad and wings, way more expensive that it should be. Service took ever for refill, and the place wasn't even that busy. Looking at the prices on the entire menu, everything is priced an average of a dollar more than expected."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times now and I have found the atmosphere fantastic, the service is great and the food is good. I wouldn't say it's amazing but it's good! I'm new to the neighborhood and I know it will be a go-to place for my friends and family."}
{"text":"Came here to eat today as my boss and 2 coworkers wanted to. I know People love this place, I am just not a fan, even though I want to be as I understand it is a local business. 

I like the decor as the owners invite customers to bring in 8x10 photos of their dogs and they display the photos on the walls around the restaurant. The also serve free peanuts, they put in dog bowls and they let you toss the shells on the floor. 

The service has always been friendly and today was no exception. 

I knew going in I was going to ask the server for a recommendation. She said without hesitation the burgers were delicious. Sounded great, so I ordered a teryaki burger, served with mayo, pineapple, swiss & teryaki sauce. 35 minutes later our party got our food including my burger. Not sure what was the hold up as we were among maybe 10 other customers in the restaurant at lunch time. 

I took a bite of the burger and could instantly tell the bun on the burger was at least day old, the meat had no flavor and clearly was previously frozen. I did let the server know I did not like my burger and she took it off the bill without making me feel bad about not liking it. 

So I did not get lunch today, but those who know me would say I could stand to miss a meal or two. Maybe next time I will just drink at the bar and eat free peanuts."}
{"text":"BEST bartenders in town!!! Angie and Ryan really know how to make you feel at home. Professional and fun all in one!!! 
Food has improved a TON since the last time I've visited here. The lemon pepper chicken sizzler is my favorite!"}
{"text":"Great service, cute restaurant and the food was good too. Our favorite beer was the mandarin wheat. We enjoyed the cheddar fries, prime rib sliders and a Luau burger, my least favorite was the luau burger, the burger was good but the teriyaki sauce reminded me of a steak. We will be coming back.

Next time we want to try the BBQ chicken pizza"}
{"text":"Brandon was our server and he was fantastic. He gave great suggestions to eat and was honest on what is good and what wasn't. He was one the better servers I have had. The food was amazing. The grilled cheese was fantastic and the garlic fries were a great addition to the meal. I recommend this place. Neat atmosphere as well."}
{"text":"Worst service & MANAGER ever!  Been there a couple times, always good but this time HORRIBLE & Management was beyond RUDE!  Was seated quickly, ordered ice teas (15 min) ordered food, we are a family of 5,  all meals came, no problem, but my meal was all wrong, waiter totally admitted mistake, not even close (chicken instead of beef-sweet fires not regular french fries) It happens, I get it.  25 minutes later, whole family done eating, my meal comes.  No silverware, asked 2 waiters, finally all 4 meals cold, got off another table, no refills on drinks, also asked 2 waiters, asked at time of ordering for mayo for kids meal, had to ask for again, and then the bill comes. WITH MY LATE MEAL!!!! Asked to see the manager because now I admit, are very disappointed, in the service OR LACK of.  Explained the situation & she was so beyond rude, no introduction & said, if your waiter doesn't tell me there is a problem I can't do anything.  REALLY????? So i said, OK call over the waiter, I never ever complain & this is really bad.  Waiter never comes over, she comes back & says to me \"I took $5 off your bill & thats all I will do\" She then says, next time you come back we will TRY & do better.  I said, sorry have to be honest, I don't now if we will be back.  The manager then RIPS the receipts & pen & black billfold out of my hand & says-Well I hope you at least left him a tip & as NASTY as possible says to me \"Happy Holidays!\" Loudly & walking away!  I am still in shock & cannot believe anyone in Customer Service would treat anyone like that. It was like dealing with a angry child.  Maybe they got a new manager? HIGHLY recommend you need one! I don't know BUT that is NO excuse or how I & my family were treated. Sorry UNCLE BEARS in MESA this is my first review ever on Yelp & sad to say your lost a customer & will definitely tell ALL!"}
{"text":"Purchased a living social or something b/c of their dog friendly advertisement. Called to ask a few questions about the patio and the girl was extremely pleasant snd helpful. Service was great, food was a little above average. The steak sliders were yummy, loved the fries,  the burger could use something to make it more than average, bun was a plus. Get the cookie bowl or whatever that deliciousness is. Our dog would have loved a bone. We will come back and recommend."}
{"text":"We came back to Uncle Bears as we said we would on 7/2/12; we had Kaylee again; thank you Kaylee for the great service (sorry, we didn't recognize you - I think it had been a stressful day for us)!  Kaylee treated us both very professional , she was pleasant & had a great smile!  We didn't have to wait for our drinks or food very long.  We both had the Rajun Kajun chicken burger (wonderful with just the right seasoning) please thank the chef!"}
{"text":"We have been going to Bear's off and on for several years to watch Sunday NFL games. It WAS pretty awesome in the past with the free peanuts and pretty good eats. Yesterday, was a different experience for us. Our table needed wiped as it was sticky and had something gravy like stuck to it (GROSS). Three other tables arrived and got served before us. When we finally got our beer the glasses were not cleaned very well (GROSS AGAIN). We think that the girl serving us (a heavy set Hispanic girl) didn't like our NFL colors. She was NOT a KC Chief fan.
So we ended up just having beer and nuts then left without the eats. We finished watching the game at Fat Willie's. We will NOT be back. Next time it will be Natives, The Hub or Fat Willie's for us!"}
{"text":"I'm totally a fan of this place!!!

So we go to watch the Cardinals Game on Sunday. Great Atmosphere, cheap pitchers of beer and Pizza and a dozen wings for $15.99, I think the pitcher of Beer was $6.50... They have other specials as well, Mondays I know you can get a Brat and a Side for $6 bones, not too bad either.

They have T.V.'s everywhere for the Football games, I'm thinking close to 30ish T.V.'s give or take a few. Plenty of seating, also outside covered seating.

I have been there about 5 or 6 times now and really for a Neighborhood bar it's pretty nice, no spectular or Scottsdalish or anything else, but if you want a Neighborhood Bar with Friendly service, decent food and decently...way decently price Beer, with a lot of T.V.s to watch the Games, then this is the place for you if you live around here.

p.s. the pizza we had and the Honey Hot wings were pretty good in my opinon... It's a thin crust pizza, sauce is good. Wings could of used a little more meat on them, but sometimes it just happens that way."}
{"text":"The food was good and super reasonably priced. Server was fast. They had all the games on and good specials on appetizers and alcohol."}
{"text":"Wedge salad was huge like 1/2 a head of iceberg but not special... wings were alright but not awesome. Pork lettuce wraps were interesting, I'd order them again. Overall, A OK but not worth going out of your way for. Lots of TVs but they are really small and I can't imagine watching a game would be a great experience. Good Golden Tee location!"}
{"text":"Gluten free buns are available. Small patio is dog friendly as long as they can resist the peanut shells. Sandwich and burger were tasty. Would return if in the area."}
{"text":"The manager was is so kind! I asked if they could hang up a picture of my nephew who loved dogs up in the restaurant, (it's covered in dog pictures and dog bowls filled with peanuts) and he answered, \"gladly.\" Shortly after I received a call that his picture was up and to come in for a meal. The picture in loving memory is up, next to uncle bear! (The owners dog whom it's named after.) food was also great!"}
{"text":"Great place especially for the pups, outdoor seating welcomes your dogs.
Dog photos are the decor, so if you love your fur kids you will feel,at home here.
Great service, great food, good margaritas. Good prices.. We watched the game had some prime rib sliders, I think in the time we were there we had 5 support staff helping us, you will have your needs met here."}
{"text":"We've given Uncle Bears a few tries because they are pet friendly and have outdoor seating but we won't be back because the food is consistently bad. The pizza is absolutely gross, the tortilla soup is overpriced tasteless broth and the nachos are a huge ripoff. 

Don't be fooled by the show of love for pets in their advertising, only once have they even offered to bring her water. 

The servers are always pleasant but often completely untrained as they usually have no idea what's on the menu or what the specials are."}
{"text":"Had the peanut butter and jelly burger!!!!  Sooo good went beck the next night for another!! Amazing"}
{"text":"This place got me turned on to Deep Eddys Grapefruit! I couldn't be more than full for that, and to top it off, it's served in a mini mason jar! ^0^"}
{"text":"Uncle Bear's was a cute place in a retail strip that I happened to find through Yelp. 
Upon parking, I noticed that there is a great pet-friendly patio. The inside was cool. It was old country wood and set-up, with chain-link ceilings and pictures of people's dogs everywhere. I looked it up and learned that the restaurant was named for the owner's pooch. The menu had the running theme, as did the dog bowls of peanuts on each table. This is a \"throw the shells on the floor\" kind of place.
I ordered the Barkley's Big Dog BBQ Burger with fries. The bun was sweet. The burger was perfectly cooked. The fries were crisp and fantastic. My husband had a Caesar and the Prime Rib Sliders. For sliders, they were huge. The meat was tender and tasted great. We shared some warm cookie ice cream thing for dessert that was ok. It was a bit hard to scoop the cookie, and I don't recall tasting any nuts, as listed.
As for service, ok, but a little on the lacking side. Another couple came in at the same time - the man using a walker. We waited for a really long time to be noticed. We were finally seated and gave our drink orders. A nice selection of beers, including their local brew. Our drinks took a while, and we placed our order. After the meal came, we didn't see our server for a while. It wasn't that busy in there, so they had better get prepared for the Snowbirds! 
We will come here again. Probably more so in the off-season."}
{"text":"I enjoy Uncle Bear's. To me, this is a 'dive bar' for this area so I don't expect super 'high end' when coming here. The beers on tap are fine, the food is fine, the servers are fine - it's a place we go to happy hour after work that is a convenient location for us all. You get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"The food which were the pulled pork sliders were amazing!!!!  buns were a bit too greasy for my personal taste and very filling...had to take home more than half the meal. but the reason I gave suh a poor star rating was due to their own brewed beers.  I order the sampler of their beers and I have to be honest it all tasted like dog piss. especially the light beers I could not even get past one sip.  I set it back and the waiter was like well I still have to charge you for it.  im just sitting there thinking ummm even after I said I hated them all only after a sip.  

not too sure if ill stop by again or even mention this place to anyone"}
{"text":"Fantastic service matched by the quality of the food and atmosphere!  The waiter made time to interact with everyone in our dinner party, even the kids!  Great food and drink specials.  Regular menu is not too pricey either.  Lots of tv's to choose from.  They serve peanuts in a dog bowl on your table and you throw the shells on the ground.  Great option for a family dinner or catching that sporting event with your buddies."}
{"text":"Food was good but it is very dusty dirty blinds and window ledge vents full of dust bunnies"}
{"text":"WOW, I used to love this place when they were in Gilbert.  Always great service and food.  WHAT HAPPENED????  Their move to Mesa has meant in the last several years we have been there maybe four times and it only gets worse with each visit.  Went last night, 12/30/15 at approx. 8:15pm and asked to hostess if the kitchen was open as the place was rather short on customers.  She said yes and sat us at the very first both by the front door.  She was very nice but seemed extremely inexperienced.  I texted a buddy so I had a record of the time we sat down.  It was 8:17pm.  We looked and looked and looked and looked and looked at the menu and at 8:31pm my wife starting laughing because she knew I was now on a mission.  I just wanted to see how long it would take to be acknowledged before we left.  The booth right next to ours was dirty and it seemed that now was a good time for two waitresses and one waiter to all clean it together and chat.  This continued for several minutes with me assuming one of them will notice us and at least get our drinks.  The chat session ended and all three walked away.  I was now starting to enjoy our entertainment.  Problem was I was really F&$K&%G hungry.  This is the part where I give Uncle Bear's fifty-five stars.  Because of their unbelievably horrible service I pulled out my phone and looked for another place and low and behold just down the street was a place called \"The Hub\".  Now its 8:38pm and I call our new favorite Bar & Grill still from our booth right by the front door where every worker at Uncle Bear's has walked by us several times each and sure enough their kitchen is open and WERE OFF.  So we walk into \"The Hub\" five minutes later and they are packed but were seated immediately and love both our food and entire experience.  Thank-you Uncle Bear's for showing us why all your recent Yelp reviews and so bad and why your establishment is so empty."}
{"text":"We want to like this location as it is nearby. For me the place always appears to be dirty. Peanut shells all over the place that are invisible the all the help that is usually standing around.
Reminds of a barbershop that does not sweep between customers. The food and service are ok. They just need to pay attention to the little things. Texas Roadhouse has peanuts and you do not have to wade through them to get to your table."}
{"text":"Fun place for the kiddos! My son loves it here! It would be 5 stars but with the recent menu change, not too happy! Always had my regular 1/2 chicken salad sandwich, french onion soup and order of hushpuppies, then one day....all 3 were gone! Now all I get is a salad but we went from going once a week to once every few months :("}
{"text":"The food here is delicious.  When viewing the menu you just want to try one of everything!  The service wasn't great, however.  Also, we ordered the wings and asked for them to be grilled (which is an up charge).  They were definitely not grilled and I mentioned it to the waiter.  On the up side the extra charge was removed from our bill.  I do love the atmosphere at this place and I love the dog theme and all the pictures of people's dogs!  My boyfriend loves the free peanuts!  Definitely not a good place for anyone with a peanut allergy since you can throw the shells on the floor.  I would definitely go back, just hope to have better service next time!"}
{"text":"Unkle Bears is a great grill and pub - the service is great, the craft beer selection is extensive, and the \"bar food\" is above average."}
{"text":"The service was great but the food was meh.  I've definitely had better.  Ok for a bar and grill but there are better options available."}
{"text":"Uncle Bears is back! We were here a few years ago and were sad that the food and service was lacking. We stayed away until tonight when our old standby was too full to accommodate. We were so impressed by everything! From the minute we came in the service was upbeat and welcoming. Our server Katrina was so knowledgable and eager to tell us about their new beers and menu item. The beer was excellent! We loves good craft brew and this reminded us of when four peaks was still small and local. I had the chicken sliders which were better than ever with the added avocado. My hubby had the green chili burger and enjoyed it.  The only thing they could've made better was adding more to their appetizer menu. All the norms are there but they could use some additional items. Glad to be back!"}
{"text":"Normally a good place. Not this last time. They sat us and ignored us till our food was ready. Never came back to check on us. We ran out of drinks and she never checked and then we had to ask for refills. My food was good. My fiance's was horrible plus they charged us extra for different cheese and adding bacon which cost us .60 for the cheese and 2.35 for bacon. It cost us enough we could of gone to a fancy restaurant. But we went there because we like it and it's not too expencive. 48 dollars for two people. The waitress never acknowledged any of our thank you's."}
{"text":"food was good, we got burgers and fries.  We went on a Friday evening around 5 and it was more of a bar mode than restaurant mode to us.  We thought about sitting outside but it was a little windy and we didn't want the stuff from the trees in our food and hair. We had great service.  If we go back, we just would not go on a Friday night due to our own preference."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time a couple months ago. Now, my friend and I are regulars. The waitstaff are quick to seat you and take your order. The food is fantastic. I recommend trying the mozzarella stick appetizers! They always have specials going on, so check this out. People do complain about the peanut shells on the ground, but that is the atmosphere of the restaurant. They have live music on certain days and host large groups for special occasions. The place has hundreds of pictures of customer's dogs on the walls and old license plates. There are plenty of TVs available for watching the game. I love this place and will always recommend it."}
{"text":"Standard four but lunch specials are very good. Enjoy the hot buffalo wings. Tuesday lunch half price pizza."}
{"text":"We went to Uncle Bear's planning to sit on the patio but they said their misters were not working.  When I ordered a common bottled beer they were out of it.  The tennis tournament playing on their tv's was played 9 months ago.  There are a lot of good restaurants in the area that serve good food.  The distinction is therefore the service.  However, in this case, 3 strikes and they are out."}
{"text":"This review would have been 4 stars except they keep their air conditioning set so high that you sweat.   This is where my parents request to go when I take them out. We walked in on saturday which was 119 degrees that day.  I will bet it was 85 inside this restaurant.  I would have turned and bolted but was with my elerly parents. Food was good.  Service was so so.  Atmosphere is good.  They just cheap out on the air conditioning."}
{"text":"Have you ever been to a Restaurant that everyone around you seemed satisfied with their meal and your group isn't ? It's like, did we just order the worst things on the menu and everyone else knows what to order? $40 check for two. One beer, one order of brisket tacos ( about 2oz brisket total ) with just tortilla chips as a side, and an Asian salad that had at most 1 and 1/2  small fried chicken tender as meat. Really disappointed. I'm sure there are good things to eat here but somehow we picked two that sounded good and were not. I don't mind spending $40 for a meal for two but it would be nice to not feel ripped off afterward."}
{"text":"My wife had a turkey / avocado sandwich (good) with cole slaw (marginal); I had roast beef sliders (marginal) with sweet potato fries (OK).  The sliders were made with soft and fluffy white rolls, which meant that the sandwich was basically a soggy mess by the time I dipped it in Au Jus.  Given the number of nearby restaurants, we wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I enjoy Uncle Bears on Sunday after taking the family and I take the dog to the park. It has good beer on tap, sports playing on several TVs, outdoor seating and decent food. I like two things on their menu the best,  the Cajun belly rub burger and the sliders."}
{"text":"The Scorpion wings are in fact hot but you do NOT need the plastic gloves they're served with.

The TVs should be MUCH bigger.

Prices are EXTREMELY high on EVERYTHING (I.e., every salad is $11 or so, and that pretty much describes everything else on the menu).

Wifi here SUCKS. Subtracting a star."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a weeknight for a cold beer. The staff was prompt, friendly and personable. Atmosphere was chill and fun. I enjoyed listening to the karaoke. Definitely going back again soon!"}
{"text":"Disappointed. Been a customer for years. Ordered Canjun Chicken Sliders. Very blah. No flavor at all, have had more flavor at fast food restaurant s.  Service the past 2 times in has been slow.  Waitress was good, beer was cold."}
{"text":"Its been sometime that I was their last so, I don't really know how it is today.

Yeah, @what a fun place, to @

+grab a drink and watch the game
+ eat a something that is fresh and has a great taste to it.
+ a lot of TVs
+ a great theme
+ CS is great"}
{"text":"Uncle Bear's is a go-to sports bar with decent food, a good beer selection (since they brew their own) and affordable prices.

I was in town visiting my best friend over Memorial Day weekend, and we took a trip to Uncle Bear's. Much to my surprise, the menu offered a ton of gluten free options (including pizzas and buns for the burgers), and our waitress was very knowledgeable about modifying menu items. She help me create a mini tacos plate with shrimp that was entirely gluten free and tasty. Overall, the menu offered pretty standard bar fare.


We brought my friend's dog because the restaurant is extremely dog-friendly and sat on the outside patio. Nothing special about the wine selection, but since the restaurant serves their own brews, they had a nice variety of beer on their menu. We couldn't sit inside because we had a dog with us, but I checked out the decor when I ventured to the bathroom and it was warm and inviting with dog-themed bar decor. 

I'd recommend checking this place out if you're in the area and enjoy tasty bar bites and craft beers."}
{"text":"I want to be able to give more stars because I loved the food but the service is always terrible. We wait way too long for someone to come and ask us if we would like another drink and then it takes way too long to actually receive our drinks. Doesn't matter how busy they are either; it could be crowded or completely dead and we'd still wait forever before our waitress to check on us. I was there last Saturday to enjoy some karaoke with friends and just like always we waited too long to be served but the issue that made us more upset was the karaoke host. We put in our songs like usual and waited for our names to be called. We watched our waitress sing 3 songs before we could even get our 2nd song sung. When I confronted him about it, he told me that didn't happen and that he wasn't going to argue with me. You mean to tell me that we all imagined our waitress singing 3 songs? I spoke to others who were waiting to sing and one of them said that they waited an hour and a half to sing their first song when there were only 10 or so singers. Even after confronting the karaoke host, he still put in our waitress in for another two songs and told us there wasn't enough time to allow us to sing a third song. I am very disappointed in how this bar is ran because the food is great and the environment is nice but the service is appalling."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years service is great, atmosphere is so great I love that you can bring your dog, must try the peanut butter porter was great will be coming back tonight to check out karaoke didn't even know they had it"}
{"text":"Alright this place was about to be a four star place until I saw the bartender use the pitcher she was pouring the excess head from my beer in to serve another customer. Bad form. Although she was friendly and helpful. Ok beer selection, good menu. Lunch menu is always the same. Wings are ok, with the best flavor being honey hot."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed with the staff they chose to run this location. The bartender was blatantly and unapologetically rude. It's a shame because we do enjoy the food and beer selection and like to support local businesses however after the poor treatment we received from the staff we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Always solid good food and cold beer. Great value for your money. It's always fun looking at all the photos of dogs."}
{"text":"Enjoying their lunch special. Prime rib sliders.  Plenty of tv's to enjoy.  Great service and very tasty sliders"}
{"text":"Great food, and we'll definitely be back, but I was a bit disappointed with our takeout order tonight. I've been craving steak cut fries, but when I called in to place our order I was told they were out, so I went with the beer battered fries instead. However, when I was picking up my order at the back of the bar next to the kitchen, the cook set out a big, fresh basket of steak cut fries, so they clearly weren't out. I'm not sure where the confusion came from with the person who took my order, but it was disappointing for sure. That being said, the food we got was delicious."}
{"text":"After taking the dog to Comsmo dog park (for his first swim) we stopped here. Great patio. Plus, water bowls and treats for the canine were provided. I also enjoyed my Jalapeno Cheesburger! 

This is great place to hang with Fido!"}
{"text":"If you're familiar with Uncle Bears, then you know what to expect here: shelled peanuts, lots of TVs, and license plates and dog photos everywhere. This location is a little bigger than the others I've been to though. 

Came here for lunch. It was busy, but not crowded. I was seated promptly and my server took my drink and lunch order quickly. Food came out fast - cooked to order and nice and hot. Server was attentive throughout my meal without being overly so. 

Bonus points... 
...for having someone who actually paid attention to the games on TV, making sure all TVs had a good assortment of games around the restaurant. I hate it when you go to a sports bar and half the TVs are on infomercials or soap operas and you can't find someone who can operate the remote. 

No concerns about that here."}
{"text":"I see someone responded to my review to say they weren't out of anything.  Sir, you were out of everything.  Your responce is untrue and insulting.  Our waiter came back and forth from the kitchen to our table to tell us each time that whatever we had ordered wasn't available.  I ordered mac and cheese, but got cold, wet noodles with grated cheese.

Dude, don't bullshit me.  I was there, and according to what you wrote, you weren't there.

Your restaurant should not have been open that day."}
{"text":"my neighborhood spot.  awesome servers and some really really good, unique items on the menu.  karaoke friday and saturdays plus a dog friendly patio.  Love it."}
{"text":"Great service, good happy hour deals, yummy food and beer."}
{"text":"I have been going here for 10 years food is great and their beer is wow even better. It's dog friendly and the stafff goes out of their way to make it a nice visit every time"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff; great bar food. Second best wings around, I've found. The dark ale Bbq sauce is perfect!"}
{"text":"** Note:  This is a review specifically for their Gluten-Free burgers.

When I found out Uncle Bear's did gluten-free burgers, I rushed over to try one with eager anticipation.  They serve buns from the gluten-free bakery in Phoenix, Gluten-Free Creations.  Since I love GFC, I was happy to support them and anyone else willing to put GF items on their menu.

I ordered the O.G. burger... adding thousand island, pickles, and bacon.  So here's the deal.. apparently the GF buns are much smaller than their regular burger buns, so what they do is literally fold the 1/2 pound patty over, like a quesadilla, to make it fit.  This creates a few problems, most importantly screwing up the meat to everything else ratio.  WAY too much burger per-bite which pretty much eliminates the tastes from the other toppings on the burger.... all you taste is meat.  I guess this is fine if you love eating plain hamburger, but I get a burger for all components of the burger.  It would be better if they just gave you half the meat and didn't fold the patty over.

Second issue was the price.  Base price for the burger was $9.50.  They then charge another $2.25 for the gluten-free bun!!!  That is ridiculous.  When it was all said and done, with bacon, burger came with fries, and a glass of water for drink, tip included, my total was $15.75!!!!!!  That is just crazy for a mediocre burger, IMO.  

They have a great idea, serving gluten free burgers.... they would literally get 100% of my burger business, and I'm sure about the same as other gluten-free diners.  Bottom line, when a buddy wants to go grab a drink and some \"bar food\", I'll recommend we go here so at least I can eat something, but the price point prohibits me from eating there even semi-regularly.  They also sell chicken sandwiches on burger buns, I may go back and try one of those."}
{"text":"December 5th - we came here for dinner and were very disappointed.  

First was service lacked severely - eaiting took forever to come and get our food orders :( 
Wasn't that busy.....

MIL meal was not placed with our meals, waiter forgot :((

When meal did come, MIL had mac and cheese with shrimp, 2 times returned still not hot. 

Hubby and FIL had chili dogs. Both had chili on the side which was very dry and looked very lumpy. The buns were hard not fresh looking at all.

Watched manager/owner and other workers drink at the bar - big no-no!!

Filed conplaint and only comped the mac and cheese... 

Needless to say we wint be bavk for a long time....."}
{"text":"The missus is raving about her avocado veggie tacos lunch special.  Home run here, she's already talking about coming back and we haven't left yet. Prime rib sliders are excellent. But get (at least) four, not two. Great recommendations and service from Ashley. This is a fun place with great food, lots of beer choices (how can you not try Beach Bum Tropical??) both craft and bottled.   This place is kind of going to the dogs... try it and you'll see what I mean"}
{"text":"Killer place in Mesa to get your munch on with your furry friends!
The patio rawks (love the misters), and they allow smoking outside (yay!) - deal with it! Mitch's Mushroom served with sweet potato fries is the sammie of my dreams, and the bar kicks out a mean snakebite!!

Thanks guys, we'll see you soon!"}
{"text":"Came in just after opening and was immediately blindsided by the smell of \"chemical clean\" - the same smell of urinal cakes (men will know what I'm talking about). We should have sat outside, but took a booth instead. Despite the strict clean smell, there were flies EVERYWHERE. We even \"joked\" with the hostess about getting a flyswatter, to which she replied, \"I know, right?!\" ... O.o

It was almost 15 minutes before our waiter arrived at which point we already had our drink and food order ready. Wife ordered a Bloody Mary and I had one of their namesake beers, both of which were pretty good. The food, however, was abysmal. In fact, neither of us finished more than a few bites of our meals and when the waiter came by to ask how it was, we shared our disappointment and relayed the things we thought were wrong with it. Rather than apologize, offer us a different option, or offer to discount our check, his response was, \"So, would you like me to take it away for you?\" At this point, the flies had eaten more than we had, so we said yes, paid our check, and left to go get lunch elsewhere.

Half of me feels bad for wasting so much food, but the other half is happy that it was thrown away and nobody else would have to be subjected to it. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Good place for a drink during happy hour, I guess. Service was slow and inconsistent. I had the Caesar salad it tasted like it didn't have dressing on it. Hot wings were not hot (spicy).lots of TVs for sports or trivia."}
{"text":"After moving from Tempe to far east Mesa, me and my boyfriend needed new places to hang out.  being out in what seems like the middle of nowhere, we were having no luck.  One night we decided to check out this place and from the minute we walked in, we had a blast.  They had karaoke and pitchers of beer, also peanut shells all over the floor like at texas roadhouse.  the people were all super friendly and after a few drinks, i almost convinced my bf to sing karaoke. Maybe next time ;)  we'll def be back asap!;)"}
{"text":"Great place.  Food good.  Atmosphere fun.  Wish I had a dog to bring along.  Love the dog dishes full of peanuts. Pizza delicious.  Will be back"}
{"text":"I got the steak fajita salad. The steak was pretty good, their could have been a bit more meat but the taste was good. The salad was nice and large and wasn't just of the iceberg variety, it was mixed greens. Although the $10.99 price was a bit steep. The menu pricing overall is a little high for my preference for this little sports bar/restaurant. 

I tried the fries which were good. They have a bunch of TVs for sports lovers and pictures of people's pooches all over the walls. That's a nice touch."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this neighborhood bar & grill and was encouraged by the reviews here and the fact that the place was packed when we arrived at 6PM on a Friday night. Oh well....

I give them 1 star for having a happy hour until 7 while most places end at 5 or 6. That being said, the happy hour prices are not THAT great, especially for food ($2 off select that average around $10). I ordered a vodka & cranberry that was incredibly weak and tasted like KoolAid. I completely resent that I had to pay $4.75 for that drink. I stuck with Barefoot White Zin for the next drink. Husband got a $5 Guinness. Friends got Blue Moon &  a margarita. I tasted the margarita and it, too, was incredibly weak and I'm pretty sure he paid $4.75 for that as well.

Frankly, I thought the appetizers were nasty. We ordered nachos, roast beef sliders, a quesadilla and chicken tenders (which turns out weren't part of the happy hour specials but our waiter failed to inform us of this fact). I had a little taste of everything and decided most of them were not worth a second bite. The only thing I actually halfway enjoyed were the chicken tenders. 

Our waiter was nice but swamped, so he kept forgetting our drinks and wouldn't return to the table for long periods of time.

Definitely won't be returning to Uncle Bear's."}
