{"text":"Wow. This place sucks. I can't speak for the bar part of the restaurant but the dining portion was poor. It took about ten minutes to even get waited on, and another ten for drinks. Our appetizer took about 20 minutes. Not to mention the hockey puck of a burger I received. The service was bad, and I would have much rather went to Pizza Hut or McDonald's had they served beer."}
{"text":"All I can say is good food and cold drinks.  Priced very reasonably.  Atmosphere nice and friendly. Cant beat the prices on the steaks and seafood.  Quality service at the bar lounge seats.  I would highly recommend as a place to go. Portions are nice and happy hour prices excellent.   Give them a try."}
{"text":"Doesn't seem like a very clean place. I would hate to see the kitchen. We only went here because my brother goes to school close by and it was cheap and he had coupons. Food was ok, if you like greasy American food, you'd like it."}
{"text":"Food just okay. Waitress was fine and stated she would change TV to World Series game after a table of people left. Night manager came on very confrontational and said the TV had to stay on station because  a Pittsburgh team was playing. Ok but, every TV except two small ones in the corner behind  our table was wired to one receiver. Basically, too cheap to have a receiver per set.  Probably a violation of Directv. Won't return or advise any other trips."}
{"text":"Good Lord, some people's reviews are soooo pretentious. For the love of God...just review the freakin' food and spare us the pseudo, unkind wanna be food critic view points. That said.... 

Yes, this place IS older and  exists in a time warp type of vibe. You almost expect the group from \"Three's Company\" to come barreling in to sit at the bar to enjoy the people, bartenders, TV and the well priced food in their jumpsuits and side ponytails. 

No, it's not fancy, it's an old school bar where a single lady could come after work for a drink and an appetizer and no one would think twice. Or, an old man could come in and have a HUGE ass beer at the bar and a tasty dinner and no one would stare in pity. It's like that back home, very few places where you can go alone and not feel weird. 

I had just arrived from San Diego to visit my sister and of course I had to check in to see what my fellow yelpers said. Soooo...we celebrated with our traditional stop (she takes all her visitors there) at the Ground Round, had awesome margaritas created by the lovely and congenial Miss Jackie and a couple of killer burgers. 

I had the Club Burger ( like a regular club but w/a burger in there as well) onion rings (crunchy and large), my sis had the mushroom and Swiss burger, charbroiled (almost perfect) and crunchy sweet potato fries (fab!) Both burgs were medium rare and quite tasty. 

Everyone seems to know everyone, it's a clean joint, several large screen TVs. and lots of nice folks. They take cards, the prices are good and if I lived here, I would be a regular...regular alcoholic that is....thanks Ground Round for a great laid-back experience!"}
{"text":"I would compare this to a Houlihans but better prices. This place is definitely set up like your typical big chain restaurant but it has a cozy feel. I do think that the food takes a while and I have never had fabulous service but you get what you pay for. The menu is so big so there is always going to be something for everyone. There are usually offers in the entertainment book for this place so it is a nice place to grab a quick bite to eat and go about the rest of your day."}
{"text":"This review is based on the last time I ate here which was last year and I have not been back here since. 

The food here is ok, I have definitely had better elsewhere, but what put me off the most about this place was the glass that was given to you to drink out of, it smelled so bad, like dirty wet towels left to dry in a dark moist area, the glass did not seem like it was glass to how cloudy it was. The silverware had watermarks on it. To top it off whilst we were trying to eat our meals there were flies lingering around. 

To end in something positive our server at that time was very nice and the service was good."}
{"text":"The Mango Grilled Tilapia isn't bad. The Rockslide Brownie is pretty good as well. Other than that, there's really not a whole lot else I can say. It's a chain, and this is the only one left in the metro area."}
{"text":"Ground Round Wings are nearly the best wings you can find in any restaurant chain. Sadly though most stores have closed. We used to find Ground Round's in VA, DE, NJ, PA & NY. 

Some of those locations turned into Applebees, which are nice enough restaurants, the wings just aren't as good.

Wing Wise - here are the rankings I have for the wings from national restaurant or fast food chains. You may have a different opinion and that's fine. I like my wings fully cooked, dry, hot and seasoned a certain way. 

Buffalo Wild Wings - 1, VA, KY, OH
Ground Round - 2, PA, DE, 
Glory Days Grill - 3, VA
Outback - 4
Hooters - 5
Applebees - 6
Quaker Steak and Lube - (closed) - 7
Popeyes - 8
TGI Fridays - 9
Bennigan's (closing) - 10
KFC - 11
Pizza Hut - just plain lousy

See you at Wingfest 2009 in Buffalo, Labor day weekend.

Cheers"}
{"text":"Went with my dad and brother a little after the lunch hour during a Steelers game and the places was mostly empty, though I have seen the place packed for the dinner crowd.  

I had the beef dip sandwich was pretty disappointing, mostly bread, not enough meat and the meat was tough.  Service was good, the waitress made sure to check in on us through out the meal and kept the drinks filled.  Also the busser asked us specifically if we wanted to sit near a TV and watch the game.  :)

The menu as a whole seemed dated and unadventurous, even by casual dining standards.  Its the kind of typical American basics I would have expected out of a casual dining spot in the 80's.  I'm not saying they should go serve crazy unheard of foods from unknown lands, but as a whole tastes are changing in America.  People are willing to try things other than burgers, wings, and chicken strips. Add a little flair and spice to the food. The restaurant itself also seemed a bit dated, a little too dark for my taste."}
{"text":"As my birthday weekend was winding down, Kay was taking me back home, and during our trek we happened to pass a Ground Round. Memories of unshelled peanuts and a clown hitting me in the face with a piepan full of shaving cream upon turning 5 or 6 rushed through my grey matter. How appropriate. 

I seem to recall a GR being in Greentree. Now there is only one in the Pittsburgh area, apparently. 

I dunno, I don't want to hate GR. I gain no satisfaction over giving them a middling review (I didn't even like their food when I was a child), but damn it, I've just had better burgers, especially last night (wait 'til you get a load of that one!). 

Not that the Double Burger Buster, one of 14 different kinds, sucks verily. It doesn't at all. The DBB consists of dual \"Ground Rounder\" patties along with American cheese, Swiss cheese, applewood smoked bacon (isn't applewood almost a given these days?), lettuce, tomato, onion, fresh pickle, a trio of onion rings on top of it, and a steak knife domineeringly lodged through the middle (another given?). 

It's just...well, maybe I've become accustomed to fresher beef, beef that's pink inside, beef that doesn't fight your teeth, beef that drips with jus. 

Perhaps the word I'm looking for is \"nondescript.\" Everything on the burger, including the tomato pesto mayonnaise I asked for, just came together to form...nothing, that dry meat not helping matters much. 

The french fries were quite revelatory, however, as they were the gastronomic picture of scalding, perfectly salted crispness. Translation: Damn decent fries. 

Dessert was another collaboration between Kay (she picked it) and I: The Rockslide Brownie. Nuked, ready-made, ice cream scoop at the side, enjoy? Eh, maybe. Like the burger, it wasn't awful at all, it's just that fresh is always superior, and alas I've become spoiled.

We almost went to the Brighton Hot Dog Shoppe that sits in the same plaza, and  I wager that I would have had a better burger and a cheaper lunch there. 

P.S. Considering that I am a heterosexual male, I'm not one to take issue with a restaurant's decor. Having admitted that, we didn't pay the interiors much mind. Everything was spotless, though, and cleanliness is important. 

P.P.S. The service was fine, and I appreciated the large beverage cups which minimized the need for refills.

P.P.P.S. Thankfully, there were no clowns in the house this time. Unless ya count me, smart-ass."}
{"text":"This was the first of the \"casual\" fun dining places I remember going to growing up. As a matter of fact I had three first dates here, and my first legal drink.

Everyone in my family who would go to Ground Round on Sunday afternoon could not get over the fact that there were free peanuts and that you disposed of the shells by throwing them on the floor, except for my clean freak mother who put her shells in a paper napkin then politely handed them to the waitress.

Chicken fingers: this was the first place that I can recall that had chicken fingers on the menu, and for some reason we were infatuated with them. Ground Round's as I recall were very tasty, crunchy, delicious and served with bar b que  sauce. We were also in disbelief that Ground Round offered FREE refills on soft drinks, OMG free refills? WOW! This was how the rich people dined.... Lol.

When my older cousin got married he even had his bachelor party here as well as the rehearsal dinner, damn we were in love with Ground Round. 

Age catches up with us, and taste buds mature, and arteries clog and places like the Ground Round start to become faded memories. Someday when I pass a ground round in my travels I will stop in, throw a peanut shell or two on the floor and toast the three girls i happily dined here with and remember the departed family members that I spent hours with here on Sunday afternoons."}
{"text":"My family and I love this place! Every time we visit, everyone loves the food which is hard to accomplish. Quality food with generous portion sizes. The menu offers a bit of everything. On my last vist I ordered the steak fajitas which were the evening special and loved the taco salad that was served with it! The wait staff has always been friendly. We will be back soon and thanks for a great experience!"}
