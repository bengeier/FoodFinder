{"text":"Not all that great. Good food, but only canned pop to drink. Not for kids. I'll probably eat there again as it is in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Finally made it out to Oakwood to try out Mi Tierra Tu Taqueria.  They have closed the grocery to make room for a larger restaurant.  I would say that this is the best Mexican food in Calgary.  I had chicken enchiladas with verde sauce (served with rice & beans) and my husband had the choriqueso tacos.  Both dishes were excellent and very tasty.  Both were spiced well without being too hot (though it might be too hot if you don't like spicy food....we love spicy!).

The owner waited on us and the service was attentive and quick.  We will definitely be back.  Also, they are planning on opening another location at Heritage and McLeod that will have a liquor license."}
{"text":"used to go here all the time until they moved to the new location, which is walking distance from my house. I'm pretty sure they closed down this original location, though."}
{"text":"closed and replaced by a new pizza take out place

Hard to operate a business at the end of a dead end street with nothing but dog park behind."}
{"text":"Fabulous Mexican food in a casual environment. Owner operated Hector cooks then serves his Mexican specialities personally. Passionate about cooking, Hector runs a great little restaurant."}
