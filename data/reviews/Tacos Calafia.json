{"text":"Great yummyyyy tacos best In town! Wonderful service everyone is so nice great vibe here!!!"}
{"text":"Really good flavors. The Jamaica was perfectly sweetened not too sweet and highly recommend the Vampiro and Murita. Service could have been faster."}
{"text":"Food is amazing!! We definitely found our new taco place. Nice atmosphere staff is super friendly."}
{"text":"The food is inexpensive and pretty good but definitely avoid coming here if you are in a hurry. The staff seems to have two speeds...slow and stop. Be prepared to wait 45 plus minutes for two tacos."}
{"text":"First time here y me gusto  mucho si volver a venir. The atmosphere is great and people are nice"}
{"text":"I had 6 carne asada tacos and they are really good. The guacamole was excellent and I enjoyed the pepper and onions that came along with the meal"}
{"text":"Wow! So simple and soooo good! This place could easily be located in Mexico. The tortillas are freshly made and amazing. The local is not fancy but when the food is this good you don't need much more."}
{"text":"Yum 
Try the Vampiros !!
Love this place- best tacos around.
Perfect every time. 
I'm a regular now."}
{"text":"Always busy every time we go so we end up waiting for our food for quite some time but it's absolutely worth it! Simple,  tasty, reasonably priced tacos. Salsas are great too, nothing fancy over here,  just great tacos."}
{"text":"Best pork tacos and quesadillas I ever had! I go here a few times per week and can't put the pork down!"}
{"text":"Was super excited and waiting for them to open for a while finally got in to try them and what do you know they're the same guys pretty much as Tacos Tijuana up on Thunderbird and 67th I like the tacos there so these must be better right wrong like always taco trucks are better maybe I'll give him a few more months to work the bugs out try them again overall okay I guess I'll keep going to the truck"}
{"text":"The tortillas de maiz hechos de mano are seriously the best tortillas I've ever had!  Grew up in a border town raised on Mexican food and in 35 years have never had tortillas this good!"}
{"text":"Clean place and food. I have tried different taco places and I feel confident to say that this is my favorite one. I would say that the price is pretty cheap for the quality of food they serve"}
{"text":"This is my first time here and oh my geezeus it's good !!! I tried the tacos al pastor the vampiro ? and mulitas. They offer grilled onions which to me makes the tacos taste a bit better, the flavor of the tortilla is good too if you want to eat it by itself. i also tried the agua de horchata and it too was good. So please give it a try ..."}
{"text":"These are the Best Tacos around!! Every time we go it's never a disappointment!! Had Carne Asada Nachos last time and they were AMAZING!!!
Y'all gotta out something out way west in Surprise/El Mirage!!"}
{"text":"We went for lunch today and tried the taco nachos with carne asada and a quesadilla with pork. The nachos weren't my favorite, they had canned cheese on them which I wasn't expecting, but the carne asada was pretty good. The meat in the nachos was pretty salty but I think in a taco or in a quesadilla that would balance out compared to on the chips, which are also salty. The quesadilla with pork was fantastic, everything about it was perfect. Overall a great experience and I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Good food. Meet was very tender and Prices were descent.  Nice basic environment. Everyone was very friendly. I will return on a Friday night to listen to the live music."}
{"text":"Best tacos on the west side of phx. Al pastor, asada and chicken are great. Tortillas are good, salsas are good. Mulitias are great. Best al pastor straight off the trompo. Price is good"}
{"text":"Mondays and Wednesdays all you can eat. I ate 24. Some other guy, or god forbid a woman, had 32. My favorite is the Al Pastor (pork). But if I had 24 of those I'd die. $12.99 all you can eat, or $1.75 a taco. I don't know too many people who can't eat 8 tacos at 5 inches in diameter. Also they are not stingy with the meat either. The taco nachos look good too. Gonna try those next. With their glass bottled Coke."}
{"text":"Came here with the wife and got Nachos, a Vampiro, a Taco, and a Mulita can't complain at all reminded me of the Tijuana environment that I miss will definitely come back ASAP"}
{"text":"dont get fooled by the inside the food is amazing and is a must especially on tuesdays! Fresh made tacos for a dollar and some cents you cant compare these tacos to taco bell or del taco these are the real deal! I recommend the pork or steak just melts in your mouth and has the perfect combination of spices and guacamole on it! Finally found a authentic taco spot and will be definiflty coming here every Tuesday as well hope others will as well highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Este lugar es de mis favoritos para aut√©nticos tacos! Muy recomendados!!!

This is the go-to place when it comes to authentic street tacos!"}
{"text":"Honestly the best street tacos I've ever had! This place is not overpriced and the service is always great. I frequently come here and it's usually really busy, but there always is plenty of seating inside and outside the restaurant."}
{"text":"Delicious street tacos and the quesadilla was amazing. Great place very basic dining room. Great for 2-4 people not big groups"}
{"text":"Glad to get a legit taco place in our area here. All their tacos are amazing especially their Al Pastor. Will definitely be coming back to this joint."}
{"text":"I would call this a traditional Mexican food taco shop, NOT a restaurant. This location caterers to a specific market. If you like old Mexican food tradition, this place is for you. The food is good and prices reasonable. That being said, there are just a handful of items on the menu. I had to ask for a description(translation) of what most of the items were. I know \"taco\" but the rest, not so much. The tacos are street taco style (not mentioned in menu) and there are no side items or chips on the menu and there are no fountain drinks. They had 3 big ice chests with bottles in them. The bottle opener was hanging on a string near bye. The owner does know how to cook, they are friendly, the place is clean, BUT not very knowledgeable about how to run a restaurant. Next time I will probable to the  Filiberto's across the street..."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place, t the food is excellent and the atmosphere is goid. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Tasty, convenient, quick... happy this place popped up recently. Standard street menu, a couple salsas and some sodas. Fresh, made to order and hits the spot."}
{"text":"They need more menu items. This is a taco truck disguised as a full service restaurant."}
{"text":"Pastor is really flavorful, and the tortillas and guac add on to become a star studded taco."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite taco shop in the valley. I eat here at least twice a week (heading there after writing this review haha). After moving here from Cali I spent a couple years eating at spots here and there trying to find a place that did proper, no frills, street tacos. This place is killer, carne asada, pollo, Al pastor; all on point. I'd you haven't eaten here, you're missing out. HIGHLY recommended. Oh and the home-made corn tortillas? The best I've ever had, warm and kind fluffy, it's hard to explain. Just get down there and grub out."}
{"text":"This was my second time here. The food is amazing!!!! The tacos, quesadillas and mulitas del alpastor are delicious!! I would highly recommend!! The staff is friendly greeted us right away.. definitely I'll be going back!! Your choice to eat inside, outside or take out.. 5+"}
{"text":"The most amazing tacos! Homemade fresh tortillas and salsa make such a huge difference and they aren't skimpy in the meat, they load those tacos up! Mulitas are amazing and definitely a must!"}
{"text":"Excited to visit the new taco shop in the neighborhood.  I felt like I was attending a friends party .  Plastic chairs and table .  Getting over price drinks out of a cooler .  Tacos not big . Also ordered the nachos.  It came out with liquid cheese and meat only .  It costed me $6.99 which I'm sure it only cost $2 to make .  It was gross !  I will gladly go across a street to grab tacos in the future at Filberts!"}
{"text":"Good tacos, the red sauce is really spicy but it adds a kick, the atmosphere is cute with the lights hanging and the hostess that took our order was really nice"}
{"text":"Hands down the best cheek yes I said cheek tacos I've ever had. Great environment definitely be making this a regular stop"}
{"text":"Some of the best tacos and mulitas I've ever had! Wow! Amazing salsa and all the food was super fresh. You can't beat an amazing taco spot. Stop in and try this out. Authentic!"}
{"text":"Good tacos but a little overpriced. The al pastor was good. You have to order at the counter before sitting down. Then wait for your number to be called out before you go get it. There was a nice area to sit and eat outside. You can hear them clearly read out the numbers on their outdoor speakers."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best tacos in Arizona! 
Great owner and staff!! 
The vibe is so welcoming and FUN!! 
And not they have beer and music!!! :)
Gibby"}
{"text":"Honest ingredients at a fair price. The flavors were good but nothing exceptional. That being said if I am on the west side I will not hesitate to eat here again. The salsas were good and much needed as the spices on the meat was far too mild."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong the food is awesome but the service has gone down hill since my first visit.  An hour in line to order tacos is ridiculous and I always have to check my order because half the time it's wrong.  My wife's tacos always have specs of cilantro all over even tho I ask for just meat and guacamole.  It's sad because I use to come at least once a week."}
{"text":"My family was invited to Tacos Calafia, first of all, as soon as we walked in the door cashier says it will be a 35 minute wait, we waited 48 minutes to get our food, it was 8:20 when our number was called out, as soon as we have a seat, the waitress comes  in and says that there's is a reservation at 8:45 and that we needed to hurry. This place deserves no stars, if I could give them a -10 I would, I will never come here again even if invited ever."}
{"text":"I DID IT! I FOUND THE BEST TACOS! Tacos are $1.75, come with meat of choice, cilantro, onions & kick ass guacamole. The customer service was amazing but the tacos, man oh man these tacos! We ordered the carne asada to go and we were seriously regretting not ordering more. The tortilla is so fresh, meat juicy & flavorful and the guacamole is the cherry on top! I can't stop thinking about these tacos! Do yourself a favor & check them out."}
{"text":"Short and simple. This place is overhyped. Came here to check it out last night. Order number was 252 - 6 carne asada and 2 Al Pastor. The food was cold when it was served which really was a big disappointment for me. Will not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I came here kinda late on a tues night and it was pretty busy.  You order at the person behind the stand that looks like a host stand. The menu is simple and good. 

I got the al pastor taco and carne asada quesadilla which came to about $8. The al pastor was kinda dry but the carne asada meat was excellent. One of the limes was dried out. The quesadilla had a ton of meat, onion, and cilantro and was very filling. The quesadilla comes with grilled onions and a grilled jalapeno...perfectly complemented the quesadilla.

They have 3 salsas: green, red, and a very spicy red one.  The staff and service here are quick and prompt. No complaints."}
{"text":"Hands Down Some of the Best Street Tacos on the West Side!! Homemade corn tortillas, marinated Carne Asada, delicious Guacamole and not too expensive.
Show up for Taco Tuesday and get 20%off."}
{"text":"Definitely won't be returning here. I can understand walking into a restaurant and it being busy but when employees look at you and they clearly see that you're waiting for someone to take your order but just stare at you and don't even acknowledge you and then, to top it off, verbally assist Spanish speaking customers only and not me even though I'm 100% fluent in Spanish. This is not good business."}
{"text":"I Love the Tacos here! Best in Arizona! Go here pretty often. Very Family friendly. No reason to get all dressed up. More like a take the kids for some taco place. LOVE IT! Bomb! Very tasty. Lots of flavor."}
{"text":"The tacos de cabeza were bomb! Not too greasy! The carne asada tacos were on point! The homemade tortillas were a plus! The horchata was the best part! Will be coming back"}
{"text":"I was here for the first time and I had the cabeza (cheek meat), it was very tender and flavorful. The atmosphere was fun and I liked the posters they had inside, quite smart if you ask me. 

We also ordered tacos but I don't think the tortillas were made from scratch but I couldn't tell. They do serve alcohol which was very nice, overall I would def recommend it for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Man, I was really disappointed. What got our attention was the $1 street taco advertisement only to find out they were $1.75 a taco (comes with onion, cilantro and green liquid they call guacamole) I asked for just cheese on the tacos and that was $1.99 a taco. The carne tasted good, chicken was mediocre. I would MUCH rather go down the street to Mucha Lucha taco shop and get 5 tacos for $7 and be able to choose from over 6 types of meats and have whatever toppings I want on my taco for NO additional charge. I'm all about supporting businesses like this but I will not be back again. $28 and 14 mediocre tacos later and I'm super bummed. Good luck to them though..."}
{"text":"Amazing tacos. Very authentic and delicious.  I like it is set up as if you are eating in Mexico."}
{"text":"Great authentic tacos. Tijuana style. Hand pressed tortillas. Carne asada, al pastor, pollo, cabeza. All quality meats."}
{"text":"The tacos are good but you have to pay for water and when u ask for just a water cup its this warm water that isnt so great... i come back here because its close to me and the tacos are good but not too happy about having to pay for water everytime i come here.

They used to play mexican music which made it feel authentic but now they play pop music so ):"}
{"text":"Fresh made tacos that aren't greasy and not gut bombs. Reasonably priced, with three different salsas to choose from. (Green: hottish, Red (clear bottle): hotter, Red (red bottle): hottest)

The pork is marinated in delicious spices that are unique and amazing. Our office loves this place. But get there early or late (to avoid the lunch rush) as it fills up fast!"}
{"text":"Best tacos ever!! They don't have a huge menu at all. Its pretty much just a taco shop. But the best taco shop ever!  Especially if you sit outside.  You feel like your at a family gathering and like the meat tastes like it literally just got off the grill! I have no idea how I'm going to not go back there everyday.. This is the only place i'll go when I want tacos!!"}
{"text":"Really good tacos al pastor! The asada had a lot of extra fat I didn't really like them but the pastor ones where the best"}
{"text":"Omg I can't believe we've waited so long to get here. We came in for lunch, had the best chicken quesadilla of my life, and lots and lots of carne asada tacos. Their hot (hot!) sauce was so full of flavor and heat I wish I could take some home! Absolutely recommend."}
{"text":"Best tacos spot in Peoria period ! The meat is fresh af ! I like both corn and flour tortillas!!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing, the service is the best and everyone gives great customer service. They are very attentive while eating and helpful when ordering. The food is delicious, the tacos are so good no matter what kind you get! I got Asada and Pastor it was so tasteful and my family ordered cabeza and said some of the best they've had. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"All you can eat tacos on Monday and Wednesday. Great food and environment. Love the Adobada tacos. Plus there located on the west side of the valley!"}
{"text":"Love everything about this place. The chicken nachos and carne asada quesadilla are AMAZING and a definite must every time I come here!! Plus the tacos are the best I've had in Arizona!"}
{"text":"This place is the greatest taco restaurant I have ever eaten at. Between the incredible food, home-like atmosphere, low prices, and wonderful staff, you will leave with a full stomach and thinking about when you can come back. Truly authentic food and staff that make you feel as if you were part of there family. Definitely recommend this upbeat, authentic, and overall quite enjoyable restaurant."}
{"text":"TACOS CALAFIA is by far the best taco shop in the west valley. Family owned, great service and a very pleasant environment. TACOS CALAFIA offers Tijuana style tacos at a reasonable price and again with a customer service that excels. The meats are pastor (pork and my favorite!!), asada and chicken in either tacos, mulitas quesadillas or nachos... yes, nachos!! And for those that are on a Paleo diet, they offer a bowl-like with your meat of choice, a delicious guacamole and some veggies. 

Now, for quenching your thirst, they offer soda, water, JAMAICA and HORCHATA. Perfect combos :D You can't go wrong with that! 

THIS PLACE IS A MUST! Look for it on the northeast corner of 83rd Ave and Thunderbird Rd. Right next to Jimmy Johns and the new Dutch Bros location. 

TACOS CALAFIA ON 83rd Ave and Thunderbird Rd."}
{"text":"Great tasting tacos in Arizona. The food is worth the wait, everything is freshly made to order.  If you want fast food that taste like cardboard, then this isn't the place for you.  Truly the Best!!"}
{"text":"Odd ordering arrangement versus the entrance.

The employees are polite and the food tasted fine but nothing to Yelp about.

This is the same taco that you can have at any of the omnipresent taco shops that are sprouting like weeds in PHX.

Unfortunately like all of the new, trendy, tacos spots the price is too much for what you get.  Fily-Bs does street tacos that are absolutely on par with this restaurant - except that are half the price.

No problems or issues on my visit, just uninspiring food with a odd physical restaurant layout."}
{"text":"I think this is one of the best places to come and eat tacos. Everything tastes fresh and everyone is always so nice. They recently added micheladas to their drink menu and they're smaller then I expected but they're still worth it. One of the best micheladas I've ever had. Highly recommend coming."}
{"text":"By far the best tacos I've ever had. El pastor for the win! Carne asada tacos were  as well! Sauces were amazing and actually have pretty spicy hot sauce. $1.75 tacos are dangerous."}
{"text":"Tacos were authentic and amazing. I had a hard time deciding which of the three (asada, pastor, pollo) I liked best."}
{"text":"Yum and more yum. These tacos are delicious. The corn tortillas are probably the best I have ever tasted. They are super inexpensive. We got chicken, pork and steak. The chicken was amazing. The steak was also really good. The pork was good and had a bit of a sweet taste to them. The green and red sauce were pretty spicy. We will be back"}
{"text":"This place serves great tacos. Some of the best tacos I've had here in AZ. I have high expectations for authentic Mexican food since I grew up in one of the most Hispanic cultured cities in California, Santa Ana. The tacos were good. Great flavor, great atmosphere but the reason they get 4 stars and not 5, they take wayyyyy too looonngggg to get the food out. Waited 30 min for my order of 8 tacos. I've seen people leave and get their money back for them taking too long. Aside from that, great tacos and definitely will recommend!"}
{"text":"Good and inexpensive street tacos. Staff was friendly, polite, and helpful.  Ordered for take out and service was quick and efficient."}
{"text":"Fast and delicious always give you a lot of meat in the casadillas. I don't really know what else to say they are just awesome."}
{"text":"I really like the vibe of this restaurant. It looks clean, the food is cooked fresh, and it just feels like I'm eating tacos in Mexico. I ordered two carne asada tacos. The red salsa was so hot and tasted homemade. The tortillas are even homemade, but the food overall lacks flavor. Like the carne asada could be marinated more & some more spices added to the guacamole sauce. At a $2.00/taco price you can't complain much, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here. Maybe some will disagree cause the place was busy at 9PM."}
{"text":"Authentic and delicious! That wait was well worth it. Enjoyable! Clean! Great prices! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is the best taco place around, I always get the al pastor tacos and they are amazing! The tortillas are hand made in-house! Their salsas are delicious going from mild, medium, and hot, and they are NOT watered down salsas. I can eat this every freaking day if I could. They do have tacos Tuesday where they have a discount on their tacos. The staff are super nice and the owner is amazing as well. You can tell he holds high standards."}
{"text":"This is my favorite taco place , I've tried several a other taco places but these are the best tasting ones."}
{"text":"Best al pastor that I've ever eaten! So delicious and nice atmosphere! Great music, great service, and great tacos. Everyone on the west side NEEDS to stop in here."}
{"text":"Some of the best tacos and at reasonable prices. Great friendly staff. This is great for the family or just stopping in for lunch any day of the week."}
{"text":"I'm visiting the area from the Chicagoland area.  And I'm super glad I came out here to try this restaurant.  Tacos were on point.  And I can tell by the way my 2 kids ate and filled up.  I wish I was out here longer to try more of their food.  But if anyone out there gets the chance, y'all need to visit this place.  Chingo Bling put this place in his Best Tacos in Town segment.  And it truly is."}
{"text":"Since moving to Arizona, I am on a quest to visit as many different taco joints as possible.  So far, Tacos Calafia is winning.  Crazy simple (but clean atmosphere) with insanely delicious tacos.  Friendly staff and did I mention the tacos?  The pork is delicious.  Super tender and marinated to perfection.  Their salsa is phenomenal and their tortillas are handmade in house."}
{"text":"Tacos are Delicious. Just be prepared to wait at least a hour wait. Ridiculous..by the time you get your tacos, you finished yr drink. Hard to get a seat to dine in. Disorganized..."}
{"text":"Definitely the closest you can get to San Diego type tacos here at AZ.

1) Carne Asada -  No question 5 stars.  Grilled meat and fresh hand made yellow corn tortillas.  Will compete with Tacos El Gordo out of CALI and TJ.

2) Pastor- 4 stars, needs a little bit more sweetness with a hint of pineapple flavor to take the reign against all other top street type tacos.  

3) Horchata - top notch just the way I like it.

4) Costs - 5 Stars at $1.75 per taco.  

5) Flavor - No doubt the best I've had in AZ."}
{"text":"What a great little restaurant that started as a food truck. The tacos are amazing, authentic street- style tacos. The salsas are fresh and tasty and the owners & employees are super nice. A definite thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best tacos in Phoenix and on the westside!!! The Al Pastor is  and you have to get a mulita for sure! It's a must! 

I haven't tried the Vampiros yet, but I'll be trying them soon."}
{"text":"The tacos were slightly bigger than expected and had a lot of meat and more than enough guacamole. I highly recommend the carne asada tacos, they were great. Authentic tasting tacos and good, friendly service! The price is good for what you get."}
{"text":"Best authentic tacos! We love coming here, employees are always very friendly and the tacos are amazing"}
{"text":"Great authentic tacos and nachos. The cheese on the nachos is excellent. You can bring you own non alcoholic drinks."}
{"text":"It's no lie that there's definitely not a shortage of taco options on the Westside. That's definitely not an issue. The problem is, however, that few of these places are worth recommending as anything more than just a quick fix with only a few exceptions to note.

Recently opened Tacos Calafia has the potential to change all that. I'm fairly certain that it's owned by the same people that run Tacos Tijuana, only the menu is slightly expanded. 

The building used to be home to a sorta-steakhouse called Carvers and probably a few other businesses over the years. It's a pretty big space for a simple taco joint, so you'll have plenty of different seating options available. Calafia specializes in your traditional street tacos that are reasonably priced and executed surprisingly well. They also offer mulitas, vampiros, and the usual quesadillas.

My girlfriend ordered a mulita and two asada tacos. I ordered two pastor and one asada. For some reason, they messed up my order and brought out two asada. Since I didn't feel like battling through the line to complain, I just ordered a couple of extra pastor tacos to sample after I had finished. I also threw in a cheese quesadilla as well.

The asada tacos are fine, although pretty much the same as what you'd find at most places that know what they're doing. Their pastor, however, was excellent - completely living up to the praise that it's receiving from the few reviews this place currently has. I'd still recommend sampling both, but the pastor is clearly the superior of the two in terms of flavor. Additionally, you can have chicken, although I'll save that for another day.

The quesadilla was fine while the mulita actually impressed both my girlfriend and I. It's a great beefier alternative to just the regular tacos. They also were selling champurrado (Mexican hot chocolate) that we both really enjoyed. Although I'm not entirely sure if the item is a permanent staple, it damn well should be!

Are there better tacos in Phoenix? Of course. But in the immediate area, I feel this is probably one of the better options available.

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Love how they make the tortillas fresh , first time here and I can honestly say I am coming back for sure. I honestly will recommended you guys to my family and friends."}
{"text":"I am from out of town here for some spring training baseball and stumbled upon this place. Please come and eat here. Fantastic Al Pastor tacos and the Vampiro was just the right amount. EAT HERE!"}
{"text":"One of the best tacos in town, I literally am always eating lunch here that I'm pretty sure they know me by name now (not really). I am so glad this place is down the street from my work."}
{"text":"Ok so I am straight up when it comes to leaving reviews, so with that in mind let me tell you this place looks ok and might do if you are not an extreme taco lover, but in reality the only thing that keeps my review from being a 1 star is the hand made tortillas. My wife and i went on a Thursday night which was not too packed but they did have a bit of a crowd,  we ordered two tacos de asada, one de pollo, one de pastor and one cabeza. We also ordered one asada vampiero. For a drink we ordered a horchata. First off when our order was ready I went to the pick up window and there was some confusion. They did not know what tacos I ordered even though it shows on the receipt and order slip. They cook had to sort them out and set them straight by this time I waited maybe 5-6Mins at the window. They was still calling numbers to pick up food and a line was forming behind me, by the time I got to my table the food seemed like it cooled down a bit. Second the horchata we received was warm probably not enough ice in the cup. They have salsa bottles you can take to your table, red and green are the choices. You can not taste a diffrence in them as they are both spicy, now don't get me wrong I love some spice but when you can not taste any other flavors there is something wrong. As far as the meats the cabeza was ok had some flavor to it maybe it was the juice they give you to pour on to your tacos. The asada and the pastor was a bit dry and not enough flavor, you can tell when someone has put there heart into cooking and this was missing it. The pollo was ok it did have some flavor and a bit of juice in it but other then that it was nothing to write home about or even justify going out of the way to come back."}
{"text":"Ok so after seeing the video from Chingo Bling had to come and try it out. It was a little confusing at first, you get in line and pay, today Wednesday all you can eat Tacos... which I mean come on I had to give that a shot, anyways after paying you have to go up to a different line and get your food, still very much a food truck feel... sodas in cans or bottles... they do have horchata and Jamaica. Two tacos at a time... I tried pretty much all of them except the breakfast taco. Al pastor flavorful, pollo, carne asada, and cabeza... topped with onions cilantro and guacamole which I liked the guacamole it wasn't runny like other places.   Best in the West? In this part of town definitely but I'm in Tolleson so I have my to go to places. But this I will say the corn tortillas are bomb! I would go just for them! Staff were all friendly... if in area I'd come back idk if I would drive out of my way for it though but all in all it was delicious and I wish them much success! Represents authentic street tacos!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out for the first time today. I ordered a carne asada taco and the asada quesadilla. Let me just say I've never had any Mexican place do a quesadilla they way they have, and I'm glad they did because it has separated them from all other places I've had before. What i liked about it is they put cheese on the outside of your quesadilla and grills it to provide this nice cheesy crunch that's not overpowering, also they are not greedy with their meat. It was a perfect balance and it's very filling. The taco tortilla is definitely homemade and fresh.... you can taste the difference. My husband said the chicken was nicely grilled and flavorful. 

Cons: I didn't know what to do with our trash and tray. I felt awkward leaving it on the table....... otherwise... I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Awesome food and a nice chill spot to grab some tacos and kick back. I'll be going often."}
{"text":"So glad I found this spot! Purple Hustle (@chingobling) tour mentioned this was the best tacos in town! Can't believe it took a non Arizonan to get me here! But does not disappoint! Tacos are made out of fresh made to order corn tortillas Tijuana style!!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me by the homie Chingo Bling and it didn't disappoint. The tortillas hechas a mano were tasty along with the meat and cheese. I got a taco, vampiro and a mulita. I would definitely come back. 

The red sauce is super hot but delicious."}
{"text":"Hands down the best tacos we've had in Arizona so far. Fresh corn tortillas (that are perfectly warm and soft, not kind of stiff kind of stale tasting), quesadilla that's filled with meat and not all cheese, standard \"con todos\" toppings including guac (real, simple guac, not the doctored up premade kind), mulitos also to die for. Casual atmosphere that feels comfortable and pleasantly buzzing. Went on a Sunday afternoon and felt right at home."}
{"text":"This place has some of the most delicious tacos in the valley! Very good guacamole and the tortillas are freshly made! One of my favorite taco places for sure!"}
{"text":"Very good ! Busy but worth the wait! Will definitely be back. Giving it 4 stars because the horchata was a little powdery. We had carne asada tacos , steak quesadilla and tacos el pastor."}
{"text":"I waited for over 1 hour for tacos. Do not come here. The tacos were good but not worth the 1 hour wait. So disappointed. One freaking hour for tacos"}
{"text":"Great one stop taco shop. Simple menu and great service. Highly recommend the vampire pastor taco."}

{"text":"TACOS TUESDAY, EVERYDAY!!!! Thank me later... Come check out Tacos Califa if you want some flavor, some good vibes, and maybe a beer or three. We ordered tacos, a Vampiro(tostada) but no beans, and a quesadilla. All were El pastor and Carneasada as they were out of pollo. The el pastor was amazing, and the Carneasada was on point. I've never personally had a Vampiro before hence why I ordered it. Another reason was I was told it's double meat! DOUBLE! This was awesome, very crispy and flavorful along with the fish and house chile . Now the tacos are made with what seemed and tasted like homemade corn tortillas (not confirmed) but very delicious. If you've never had el pastor please do me a favor and just try one taco, your free taco when you check in...thank me now"}
{"text":"algo bien!!!! una chulada de tacos asta el saborsito de carbon tiene la carne. los de cabesa ni se diga!! .....super delicious tacos!!!!"}
{"text":"This taco shop is very good, I highly recommend the steak tacos, very delicious and only $3.80 for two tacos. Nice and friendly staff, however I had to wait 30 minutes just for two tacos, I definitely recommend ordering your food before you go. Atmosphere was cute and boujee, will definitely coming back soon!"}
{"text":"First Time here -not terrible but not great! If you are looking for a decent street taco but you don't need extremely friendly service then this is your place! Tacos truly were good but salsa was a little tomato tasting instead of spicy! 
Try it for yourself"}
{"text":"Amazing tacos every time I've been there and that's 5 times now.  The fresh corn tortillas are a game changer, best I've ever tasted. The Al Pastor is top notch.  The chicken wasn't dry but juicy and flavorful.  Great portions for the price.  Anything other than 5 stars is crazy."}
{"text":"I admit I was apprehensive when I pulled up as all their windows were filthy and had not been cleaned in a while. I am thankful I went in and to my surprise the interior was spacious and clean. The order area and menu a bit confusing but after a few questions I ordered tacos with chicken, al pastor and Carne asada with everything along with a corn quesadilla al pastor. The flavors were spot on and the touch of guacamole and fresh tortillas were a big hit. The 3 salsas were in squirt bottles but not labled to help know what was in each. Red, Redder and Green were all watered down and bland.  I, like others have posted found it hard to carry the dirty plates while lifting the gavanized rubish bin lid to dispose, maybe a different bin or small table would help. Overall I really enjoyed the food and will be back. Hopefully the managment will address my concerns as I hope to give them all 5 stars soon."}
{"text":"Can eat here everyday. Love the tacos and quesadillas and the prices are so amazing!! Support local"}
{"text":"The tacos were good, but the order took 30 solid minutes for 6 tacos. Additionally, the music was way too loud for inside, we could barely talk loud enough."}
{"text":"Not quite open all the way yet, but taking Ngo good care of the Spring Training crowd. Yummy tacos; miss my carne asada. Can't wait to see when it is finished."}
{"text":"Kind of a taco truck service (not a dig at the place) where you order your food, sit down and wait for your order number to be called. Since this was my first time and obviously haven't tried everything. I'll start with the one line strike...the Pollo aka Chicken taco. It had no flavor other than the charred taste. Next, the asada (steak) taco...really good. Nicely seasoned, moist, chopped into thinly sliced, easy to chew cubes. Finally, I had the pastor (pork) Vampiro. This was friggin awesome! The pastor had such a great flavor but then you mix it with cheese, guac and grilled onions all on a perfectly sized tostada! Man! The tostada was homemade so it didn't fall completely apart as you are biting it. All in all I would definitely go back and recommend this place although I would not waste time or money on the chicken. Looking forward to trying the Mulita and the tacos de Cabeza. The Pastor though!!!"}
{"text":"Hand-made corn tortillas. Killer al pastor, bomb carne asada and lights out pollo asada. Fresh salsas. Glass bottle cokes. Who cares if the floor's cement and the chairs and tables are plastic and folds. The food rocks, and it's way cheaper than it should be."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a casual dinner with friends. Love the ambiance, and the food was excellent. It's a great place for a casual meal, where they don't rush you out to turn over the tables. The menus is somewhat limited, but everyone in our group was happy with their food... I had the al pastor tacos, and others had the quesadilla, pollo tacos and carne asada tacos. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"A great taco spot for anyone craving an authentic Mexican taco. Came here after a Spring Training baseball game. Tacos Calafia did not disappoint. They have $1.75 street tacos that are outstanding. Almost feels like stealing they are so good. Another taco that are \"to die for\" is the Vampiro. Very much like a tostada. A crispy tortilla that is topped with cilantro, onions, meat and guacamole. Again, an outstanding taco.
Ordering from the friendly staff. My friends and I, on vacation from San Diego, ordered our tacos to go. Back at our hotel room. No one talked much. Just the sounds of guys eating tacos. You know the food is good when everyone is truly enjoying their meal and no one is really talking. Yes, that good.
Support local business especially the good ones. I am jealous I am out of towner. I would eat here every week. Tacos Calafia is a excellent taco spot. If not one of the best I have ever ate. Eat tacos here."}
{"text":"Pretty nice place. Weird order system, go to one place that's not marked to order, then another place to pick up your food. Lots of toppings including guac on the tacos and good salsas with a fair price."}
{"text":"Went for the All you can eat tacos today 12.99. They have it on Mondays and Wednesdays. I ate almost 8 tacos. I'm rolling around my house right now. I normally would only eat about 3 maybe 4 tacos. If I go back I will stick with the 3 and not do the All you can eat. If you are a big eater its well worth it. 

Since I had the All you can eat I tried all the meats they offered. They were all good. The pastor was my favorite. The marinade was on point with it. The tortillas are homemade fresh yellow corn tortilla regular sized. Toppings are cilantro, onions and guacamole with a half a lime. They allow you 2 tacos at a time."}
{"text":"Yummmmmmm.........
I'm a food critic , and these are absolutely delicious!
Five stars"}
{"text":"First time here but won't be my last!! The guac was soo good, the meat was juicy and perfectly cooked. Wish the red sauce was spicier but overall tasted really good. I got the quesadilla but I'm sure everything tastes amazing. If you're craving something fast and delicious come here :)))"}
{"text":"The tacos are perfection! The tortillas are fresh hand made and the meat is perfectly seasoned! I had both al pastor and carne asada tacos and they were delish! We got the family packs since we had 8 ppl eating (all grown ups) and it fed us perfectly! We did order two more mulitas just bec we wanted to try them but we were definitely full. The mulas were so good! The cheese was crispy on the outside and melted on the inside! Put one in California and I'll go! The place is big and it didn't take long to get our food and it was packed but not packed enough for us to not get a seat so it was perfect. We were lucky and got to hear the mariachi not sure if it was a special occasion but it made it that much better!  

Horchata and Jamaica were also really good! I want some more tacos!"}
{"text":"Tacos Calafia tiene empleados muy amables. Y los tacos de asada est√°n muy ricos. Yo vuelvo a ir otra vez y vengo del sur de Phoenix."}
{"text":"Stopped in here the other day after having been a fan of the truck on 67/Tbird and the Bell location. It's a nice joint but the meat in the tacos was lukewarm and we didn't think the tortillas were up to par with the other locations. Maybe it was a bad day. On the plus side, they do have beer & wine, last I checked the others don't. Will go back to give them a 2nd chance."}
{"text":"Best AL PASTOR hand down!!!! I have finally found a real authentic taco spot and believe me I know Tacos!!"}
{"text":"Legit authentic place for tacos!  The only downside is they don't offer flour tortillas for their tacos."}
{"text":"first time coming here just decided to make a quick stop after dutch. Didn't even think it'd be that great but just wanted to give it a try. Very cheap and very good tacos. The beef was better than the chicken. Cute atmosphere and actually a pretty big place but was surprisingly very busy. Almost all the tables were filled and there was a long line. Employees worked quickly to try and get everyone's order taken and ready, but still took a little while just bc there were so many people. I would recommend ordering ahead of time or coming at a less busy time"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to eating here only to leave disappointed and unsatisfied. The carne asada was ok at best, the al pastor was very tasty. Where they fell short was where they skimped on the amount(a Very Small tablespoon) of meat on both types of tacos but especially on the al pastor! I understand they are street style tacos and aren't very big to begin with but I've had some really healthy street tacos in town,  these were pretty weak! I wouldn't have complained had they costed 99c but $1.75 a piece!!! I for one never hesitate  paying for a meal whatever the price, if it's worth what they are charging. Come on Tacos Calafia! Put some meat in them tacos!
There are other places in town I would recommend for a good street taco.."}
{"text":"This place is soo good! Great customer service and good prices. Authentic! You can smell how good it is from Thunderbird. Definitely recommend it. Also, their red salsa is so spicy, but so good!"}
{"text":"The best tacos!! Nice and clean place, and great service. I've tried almost everything they have and everything tastes great. You should definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"Incredible!!! Came here after hearing it was amazing- we were not disappointed!! The simplicity of the decorations in the restaurant were nice! We each tried the carne Asada tacos and a pollo taco along with carne Asada nachos and horchata. Everything was delicious!!! The meat was super flavorful and tender!! Awesome experience and we will definitely be back with our kids who will love it all!!"}
{"text":"Best taco shop here in Phoenix without a doubt! Super traditional Mexican tacos, meat is well seasoned, and hand made tortillas make it much better! The asada tacos and al pastor are to die for! Finally found a taco shop that meets my expectations of real Mexican street tacos."}
{"text":"When the boss is around, things are great! Unfortunately however, this location (compared to the truck on 67 Thunderbird or their 51 Bell location), will say things like \"we only put guacamole on tacos if the customer requests it\" (never mind their sign - and experience - say otherwise). 
And we sure hope they quit selling meat when it's waaay past dried out. Neither the truck nor the sit down have ever dished out the stuff the 83rd ave location game us today. Don't get us wrong - they're lovely people, and we're rooting for them, however; we got ripped off today."}
{"text":"Order taking process is horrible, they need to get some people that can take orders the line is unnecessary. Also made an order and after waiting 15 minutes asked to get 3 of the 15 tacos on flour tortillas they told me that flour tortillas cost more so I had to stand in line again to pay the difference. 
As far the food goes, they have great food tastes amazing. Tacos were great quality and fresh."}
{"text":"I need to preface everything with... the food is REALLY, REALLY GOOD. That will get me coming back. But not when I'm starving. The food is super fresh and you can see them making it behind the glass. It's delicious and if not for the beyond long waits, they'd get 5 stars. 
It just takes waaaayyy too long to order and get your food. I know they're fairly new and probably have some kinks to work out. But we've come in a few times to get food to go and are here, at minimum, 30+ minutes. Maybe not enough staff? I'm not sure why it takes so long to order. People have a huge menu to stare at while they're waiting. But it still takes forever. Probably won't come back while Spring Training is going on. Don't have that kind of patience."}
{"text":"Tacos are really good ! Great place to bring the family. Prices are very good for amount of food served."}
{"text":"If the beach were across the street, I'd believe I was in SoCal. The food is binge worthy to say the least. My only complaint, which is really just nitpicking, I wanted a little more salty flavor to my meat, and was itching for some pico at the salsa bar. This place is definitely serving the best tacos in the valley. If I could give a half star more, I would be giving Tacos Calafia more justice. I will be back, possibly tonight."}
{"text":"Came it for dinner at the recommendation of a friend. We came in through the side door, which is their front door. Upon entering it was very warm inside. The girl at the register took our orders right away and was very patient and we looked over the menu. Which was very simple. I ordered two tacos (asada, pastor) and Mulita (pastor). We got our food pretty quickly considering it was dinner time and they were busy. They have 3 tables outside and decided to sit on the very clean tables and chairs. I was not disappointed in any of the food. Good flavoring and the corn tortillas were handmade, not too thick or thin. They never fell apart. I will def be coming back."}
