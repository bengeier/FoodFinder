{"text":"I've been to the underground a few times with friends and to catered events. Service is slow. Staff are not very knowledgeable about allergens in the menu items. On one visit to a catered event, I was restricted to eating only mashed potatoes.
Given wait times for service and the big question marks about what is in the food, I think I'll pass, even on the catered events to which I am invited."}
{"text":"good food, expensive prices. service is pretty bad. long waits as its usually ran by students.... -__-"}
{"text":"Like most restaurants at York University, the underground capitalizes on the fact that they have a captive market so they don't really need to care about providing good service or quality food.  It's \"student run\" which seems to mean that the staff are slow / indifferent / chatting in the kitchen instead of attending to the customers and the food is either cooked improperly or mediocre.  I've just stopped going to this place entirely. You can't have lunch there in 1 hour because the service is too slow, even if you order something incredibly easy like a soup they still can't seem to manage to crank it out.    AVOID."}
{"text":"The Underground.  Ahh....been here several times as it's an easy place to meet co-workers for lunch while still fitting into that 1 hour lunch break.  Services is always a bit sketchy (as you can see from the other reviews).  That said, we called ahead and made a reservation and when we got there we let them know we only had 1 hour to order eat & pay and we wanted separate bills.  That helped to clarify everything right up front and we didn't' have any issues.  Burgers seemed to be a really big hit with our group.  I ordered the So-Cal salad which was great, but not very filling.  I would have preferred a salad with a bit more substance.  I was trying to eat healthy, but ended up consuming my friend's sweet potato fries because she was stuffed from her burger.

All in all good experience."}
{"text":"My friend i went there and had some wings and fries, well the fries were TOOO CRISPY and they were very dry not not very tasty..the wings were undercooked..tasted raw..it was okay.."}
{"text":"Never come here unless you're dying. The provolone sticks gave me diarrhea. They should trash it and build a trash dump for all the good it does. The food is so greasy your insides practically become a Grease musical set in a McDonald's fryer. It's like they make up for the lack of quality, taste, and flavor in grease. It's honestly a lot to compensate for. As CMU student's it's practically a hazing ritual, one that should be illegal."}
{"text":"The menu here has really improved- they've introduced a real international flare to their dishes. The only problem is that the price is a little more than I'd like to pay- especially on campus. Burgers are a reasonable price but I got a curry poutine which tasted great but the portion wasn't meal sized- the price was! 

The service is BAD. Leave time and expect your order to need changes."}
{"text":"Staff is horrible. Last time I ordered from here was fish and chips. The fish was completely burnt. Honestly didn't know why I should complain but my fault. Overall , food is bad and the service is pretty crappy to be honest. Advoid."}
{"text":"One of the best chill spots at York. Always a good time for drinks and appetizers. They have the best nachos, I would definitely go to york just for those. Their menu isn't so fancy and the food is just okay. Service can be slow at times since they'll be jam packed in the evenings."}
{"text":"Out of the 4 years I've been at York, last semester was the first time I ever stepped into the Underground. Through word of mouth, I heard they recently invested $1 million on renovations and what not. Um...sure?
The restaurant/pub is decently decorated. I wouldn't say $1 million worthy. But again, how much can you really expect from a school bar?

Upon looking at the menu, you actually get excited because the pictures and descriptions of food are interesting. Although, this is far from the truth. Their food is mediocre at best :/

I have tried the french onion soup, fries, some pastas, thai chicken curry...the rest I don't remember. The three times I've been there were usually with friends and we'd share plates.

I would never ever get the soup again. The curry was good, but not worthy of a second try.

The place is surprisingly busy though. I suspect everyone is there either for their daily deals or the booze. I went again today. Everyday is $10 pitchers. Monday, not sure. Tuesday, half priced wings/$4.99 per lbs. (place is PACKED. and you know everyone ordered the wings as each table dawns $5.00 bills. lol) Thursday nights also have $3.00 shots.

The crowds are especially nice during these times. You can't help but laugh as the other table downs another pitcher, tries to pick you up, or begins to talk louder and more obnoxious by the minute. 

Have you not drank beer before? *shaking my head*

They also don't ask for ID. Which I guess being university everyone is of age. Although I'm pretty sure there are the odd 18 year old/gifted students walking around.

I would give the resto a 1, but a change of heart happened today as I tried the Chicken Burger, subbed w/ sweet potatoe fries.

I have to say, this burger was BEYOND delicious. Ciabatta bread, lettuce, tomato, and avocado. The chicken was neither a breast nor a deep-fried chicken patty. It was made out of actual ground chicken formed into burger patties. I wasn't expecting this at all. I don't think I've ever tried a chicken burger like this. The chef cooked it perfectly as well, as the inside was moist but it being ground, the outside charred nicely.

Oh. And I also got a \"Peppermint Patty\", that was a hot alcohol bevie of creme de menthe, creme de _______, hot chocolate and baileys maybe? Not sure. One of those coffee liqueur alcholic drinks. This drink was a fail. I did not taste any alcohol nor any of the hot cholately goodness it promised.

I would only go back for the chicken burger. and probably a beer. Minus the burger. Or the beer. lol.

No. I'd go for the burger definitely. And maybe the watered down draft if they're out of water."}
{"text":"Honestly this place is a hit and miss. Sometimes it's good sometimes it's bad....
Once I got diarrhea from their veggie burger LOL 
their nachos are the bomb tho"}
{"text":"I had a burger and onion rings once here before and thought they were quite tasty (and priced fairly!), but a later visit where I ordered the fully-loaded nachos and arancini rice balls did not at all meet expectations! The nachos felt a bit average for their price ($15+) and the rice balls were not exceptional either. The service I've received has also been somewhat inconsistent, with great service on my first visit and much poorer service on the second."}
{"text":"Frankly, the biggest problem with this place is that it is really inconsistent. The turn-around time for the staff and the menu is so short, that I could tell you today the service was great and the poutine was amazing but you can come next week and its completely different due to changes in the staff. 

I've been here a couple of times during my years at York, since it's one of the few sit down restaurants on campus. The service has always been so-so, since the staff is most likely full of part-time employees, probably students that are undertrained and the staff is always changing. There are long wait times, no one serving you or seating you, disorganization, servers who forget about you, forget to take your order, get your order wrong, all sorts of amature restauranteur moves. 

For a while, I really liked their burgers, I had the Big smoke, a big juicy patty with bacon, a good mayo sauce, cheese and fried onion rings, between soft fresh buns. I don't like ketchup with my burgers so the mayo sauce was a plus and who doesn't like bacon and fried onion rings. And with a side poutine with fresh fries, good quality cheese and sodium-packed gravy, it was amazing pub food. This is coming from someone who doesn't even like burgers. However, as of the last few months, this has changed. The menu changes all the time. The Chef I guess changed too. I've had the same burger and it was definitely not the same. I'm not sure what it was exactly, the patty was not as juicy, the bun not as fresh and soft, the sauce had different flavour and onion rings too small. It was just all wrong. This time the fries weren't even fresh and the cheese didn't melt in the poutine. My most recent visit, they changed to skinny fries and not even the thick fries. I'm just really disappointed and I'm not sure if this place can go back to the same caliber, ever."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has low reviews. I've been here several times in the last couple months and everything about the place is great. A wide variety of different dishes, friendly staff, and the ambience is fine. I love that they serve halal food, definitely a positive bonus. The fish and eggplant lasagna were by far my favourite dishes. And the portion of the fish was huuuuge. I think the lasagna was a special they were having. First time I went I had one of the burgers (can't remember now) but it wasn't anything special. They have better dishes."}
{"text":"Honestly the low rating is usually well earned. This place is convenient and a great place for groups, however there are so many reasons to avoid it if you can. The service is usually quote slow and the staff can come off as jaded sometimes which is rarely exciting for the every day customer. That put aside, the prices are outrageous for a student restaurant. Everything averages $2-5 higher than other places and then, for example, the burger will come out and be tiny, dry, tasteless. I wouldn't pay $5 for the burger I got and yet I had to pay $15. 

That being said, the biggest problem with this place is the really terrible value you get, especially seeing as it is a student's restaurant in the York student centre. What I can suggest to bring up the reviews is to pay attention to service and adjust the value: either bring up the value we get for our money, or lower prices. Otherwise it'll stay empty."}
{"text":"Food was disgusting and not cooked well. Ketchup was also sour and expired when we got it. Not worth the money!"}
{"text":"The Underground has definitely gone through many changes over the years, some for the better, some for the worse, but more recently definitely for the better.

The menu is nice, not too over the top. Definitely more easily palatable foods with flavours for everybody. It's not haute cuisine, it's delicious cuisine for York Kids. 

I had the Cajun Chicken Club w/ Fries which was HUGE. It wasn't a club per say, like in the sense with the three slices of bread etc, but it was all just piled into one huge bun. Delicious, but mad hard to eat. 

We also had the risotto balls to start, and I actually really loved it. Ate 4 out of the 6. And I'm not usually a fan. 

The menu is easily laid out, the portions are huge, and its easily marked halal for those who need it to be. 

Drinks are a bit overpriced, isn't this supposed to be a student joint?


Looking forward to trying out the next time the menu changes. 

Expect to spend about 20 per person."}
{"text":"It keeps getting worse and worse..

Starting from 2014 school year, the underground 'renovated' as in: taking away half the alcohol on their bar, eradicating their everyday specials (No more half priced wing tuesdays!) and changing their entire menu.. 
I was told all the 'good' people graduated so the new servers are not as great. My friend ordered a vodka cranberry and they came back with a glass of vodka for her. When she said \"Can I have a cranberry juice with this?\", the girl got confused. LOL um my friend isn't about to chug a glass of vodka before her class. 
Sometimes when the servers come out from the kitchen, they look so confused as to what they're supposed to be doing... they're wandering around and forgetting simple stuff. Gave pasta without a fork? Okay.
The food is alright, it's mediocre at best. The jerk chicken poutine is yummy, but the cheese is not melted at all. It's quite hard sometimes when you bite into it. The portions are not big enough for what you're paying for. Also, the drink menu shrunk so much ;___; their drinks used to be amazing! Mixed the coolest shit together and had great names.. now it's just all the basics. Ew.

I'm always like \"I'm down to eat at the underground!!\" and when I get there, I'm like \"....k nevermind.\""}
{"text":"I ordered the French Onion soup and a Chicken burger - the soup was mediocre, and kind of cold, but the burger was good(although the price makes it just kind of mediocre). Other times I have been here, the food has been average to above average quality, but overpriced. It is a good place however to sit and work during the day, when it's not too busy, since coffee refills are free."}
{"text":"They have a pretty good menu at decent prices. The Underground is a great place to swing in for lunch or hang out for dinner  with friends. They have a pool table and a tv with couches, and a cozy atmosphere. You could definitely sit for a whole and do some homework, or just get in and out. The staff is very personable, and while it is A CMU eatery, you could probably come in to get food without being a student."}
{"text":"It's college food, so we shouldn't expect anything good out of this place, right?

Well, yes and no. For the most part, the food here is pretty average, which honestly is good if you think about the other disasters that have somehow established themselves on campus. Unlike other places on campus, the underground convinces me that some of their food actually isn't frozen food bought straight from Walmart. Plus for that. Furthermore, the underground offers a variety of options that are practically available all day, which is awesome for hungry college students with crazy sleep scheds and crazy appetites. Some options that I've enjoyed from the underground include their cuban sandwich and salmon burger. Everything else is pretty average or just has a combination of crap that makes you wonder how they formulated such a dish in the first place. The pumpkin spice latte is also pretty good, so plus for that.

The underground features many tables, which is awesome for study groups. They also have a small lounge with a TV, a pool table, and a broken foosball table in front of the bathrooms. So yeah, average place equipped with typical college furniture. Welcome to the underground."}
{"text":"Ohhhh The Underground. I'm back in school after graduating over 3 years ago and my undergrad university had very little restaurants or food choices. So I was thrilled to learn that there was not only a mini mall at York, but a proper restaurant as well! And thus began my love-hate affair with The Underground.

The Hate
The service is painfully atrocious. I realize that it's a case of students serving students, but that doesn't mean that you should just toss away all effort. There seems to rarely be anyone at the podium where you're supposed to seated. At one point my friends and I waited almost 10 minutes for someone to show up and seat us. Except for one meal and a very friendly male waiter, most of the time it seems our waiters forget that we exist. The waiters are usually vaguely friendly or indifferent.

The Love
The food is good and the menu choices are pretty fantastic. Every time I go in, I curse my wallet for not being fuller because I usually want to take a bit out of most of the items there. They have great dips and salad options, and you can tell that they've put a lot of effort into their menu.That goes for their drink menu as well, which is reasonably priced and has a great selection. The layout and design of the restaurant is quite nice as well (when the waiters actually clear the tables). Quite frankly, I was surprised that a university had a restaurant that looked that nice.

I feel like with a bit more staff training ( I get that they're university students and are hard to motivate, but they're not high schoolers either) this will be a really great restaurant."}
{"text":"1 star for the slow service. Drinks are pretty good. Food is usually pretty decent. However, last time I went there, I had their lettuce wraps and got food poisoning shortly after."}
{"text":"Came here with my cousin after class. The food isn't that expensive and it taste ok. We had the jerk chicken poutine, didnt really like it. Tasted more like jerk chicken and fries not really a poutine. I expected more gravy and cheese curds with pieces if jerk chicken in it. The risotto balls were so delicious ill be back for them again. The shrimp and ravioli was ok I want to try some of the other pastas. Overall our meals was ok I'm still curious to see what els they have to offer."}
{"text":"The revamped Underground is looking good. It is clean, classy and modern. The menu has also gone under an extreme makeover. The food is better than what you would expect from any university pub. In fact, I would say that the food is up there with some decent establishments. The beer selection, with the exception of Granville Island, is pretty lousy. I hope they bring in some stout beer. Won't somebody think of the pretentious philosophy students?! 

I was impressed with the new Underground. The space looked nice, the food was good, and prices were OK. The service was an entirely different story. We must have waited 20min to be seated. The food arrived shortly after but our waitress took forever to bring us the bill. She was also not arithmetically inclined. She had a hard time splitting the bill four ways and forgot to charge us for a beer at the end. Looking over at the other tables, there seemed to be an obvious lack in communication and training of staff. The management needs to be running a much tighter ship. There were plenty of staff on the floor but the service was extremely inattentive and most seemed lost. 

Atmosphere: 7/10

Food: 8/10

Service: 3/10"}
{"text":"This place is horrible, from the service to the food.
My friend had the veggie burger and when it arrived with goat cheese, when she asked to omit the goat cheese, the waitress kept arguing rather than taking the plate back. My friend got fed up and just scraped it off the burger, of which the patty itself was falling apart. I had the grilled cheese, which came burnt, definitely NOT how mom makes it. 
Never coming back here again. Ever."}
{"text":"I had a delicious falafel quinoa salad here with tahini sauce. it was high quality and fresh. the only issue is the time it took to get it out. Its not a good option if you're tight on time. 

the staff were friendly but the place looks understaffed especially in the kitchen, I had to look for the waiter and wait to get us seated. we were 6 people and it was lunch time but not crowded."}
{"text":"After living in morewood gardens for a year, I have tried most things on this menu. It's okay for college campus food I guess.

While the food can taste good, my problem is that everything here is really really greasy. This includes the perogies (which seems to have disappeared from the menu), the Reuben, the quesadillas, the cheesesteak, and the sweet potato fries. The Alfredo pasta isnt greasy per say but it does feel very oily and doesn't taste great. The salads also aren't very good - they sound exciting but they're just premade and put in  containers that you can pick up  at the register and premade salads are never good. One bonus is free coffee after 8 pm during finals though!

This place can hit the spot. But I would only eat here as a college student with a meal plan."}
