{"text":"I ordered $5. Box meal includes: fries or nacho, choose 2 main item of tacos or burrito, a dessert and a regular size pop. Price and portion value are way cheaper than next door McDs'. If you're hungry and tight budget, $5 box meal is a good option."}
{"text":"Psssst... YOU...come over here... I have a confession to make.  I love cheese fries. I don't know WHAT the cheese is made out of and quite frankly, I don't want to know, but I DO know that no one makes 'em quite like Taco Bell.  Imagine my disappointment when me and a bunch of girlfriends took a trip across the border for a shopping spree and sat down at the local American Taco Bell and found out they DO NOT serve cheese fries at Taco Bells in the United States. I'm sorry.... SAY WHAAAAT?!?!?!?  So Canadian Taco Bells are where it's at. Dreamy combo? Seven Layer Burrito, cheese fries, medium diet Dr. Pepper (don't ask why I bother with the 'diet' at this point) and extra extra EXTRA hot sauce packages on the side. WICKED.  If you've never discovered all that is Taco Bell, I highly recommend it as a satisfying, tex-mex type of fast-food experience. It's tasty...not necessarily healthy...but TASTY."}
{"text":"I go to this Taco Bell up to once a week. It's clean, the food is good, and the staff are friendly. They even let my brother rent out the place for his wedding rehearsal dinner. Best Taco Bell in Calgary."}
{"text":"Worst taco bell in the city, well Mindapore is a close contender! Go to Signal Hill or Petro Canada Centre one for good food."}
{"text":"Almost certain that the 7 layer burrito is made of a cruel mixture of toxic sludge and laxatives. But somehow you just can't stay away"}
{"text":"Every now and again I'll have the odd misfortune of eating somewhere and discovering that I know the menu better than the employees do.  This was the case when I ate here recently and wanted to order off the new \"Fresco menu\".  Taco Bell has apparently spent a lot of product development money on promoting this new set of menu selections (as part of their \"drive-through diet\" campaign), but spent none of it on educating their employees about it.  I first ordered the Fresco steak burrito, and got a regular beef burrito but without dairy.  I argued with the employee that this wasn't what the Fresco steak burrito was supposed to be, but he argued otherwise.  I gave up the battle and decided to order the Fresco chicken burrito instead, and got a regular chicken burrito supreme.  Deciding not to argue the point further, I simply threw out both burritos and walked across the street to Booster Juice.  (For those of you who are curious,  and for any Taco Bell employees reading this, the Fresco menu features low-fat selections, replacing ground beef with lean steak, and regular chicken with chicken breast.)"}
{"text":"Sometimes I get the odd craving for Taco Bell's fries supreme.  Probably stemming from being a pre-teen and going there constantly with my fam.  Either way, I haven't had it for years but suddenly had the urge for a cheap taco and supreme fries.   It did not disappoint, and the gentleman running the cash was very polite and did an excellent job with service."}
