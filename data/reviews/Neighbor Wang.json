{"text":"We walked by and the menu had a good selection and atypical vegetarian options. The A02 noodle dish has exceeding my expectations and the pickled cabbage/smoky chilli flavours went perfectly together. No drink menu but reasonable prices. Will definitely be back this winter."}
{"text":"Great food for good value! All of the service staff were kind and attentive, will definitely return! :)"}
{"text":"The food is a 4.5 star! Fried Dumplings Dumplings on Fire were delicious. Tried the Dan-Dan Noodles and Chongqing Noodle. Both had dynamic flavours and interesting textures combining the crunchy peanuts with the juicy noodles and soft pickled veggies. Ambience is cute and cozy, great set up for large groups (we fit 6 in a booth).   Rated it a 2 star as the service was terrible. Overall the server was non-attentive (there were only 2 other tables). We didn't even get plates for our appetizers. He then dropped the dish of dumplings on the table, splashing chili oil and peanuts on 3 of my friends. Did not make much of an attempt to resolve the situation.   I might return for take-out because the food was so tasty!"}
{"text":"Very authentic Chinese food. Probably the best you can get in this neighborhood. Large portion for a good price."}
{"text":"First of all, it is spelled Neighbour, not Neighbor. You are in Canada. Use the Canadian spelling.  Unbelievably bad service. We had to ask for bowls, chopsticks, water, spare spoon for the dish (we share our dishes), one at a time! The food was a disappointment. Will never go again."}
{"text":"We had high hopes for this place because it reminded us of places in Asia even down to the playful menu.  Unfortunately that's where the similarities end.  The food was very mediocre at best and the portions were all pretty small.  However the worst part was the service.  It's basically run by a bunch of 20-something year old kids who clearly don't know how to run a restaurant.  They got one of our orders wrong, didn't bring us our drinks but charged us for them and it's like pulling teeth trying to get more water, even though we see all 3 of them standing around talking and doing nothing throughout the night.  The table next to us seemed to have a worse time. They brought them the wrong order then asked them to eat it anyways but would give them a discount!  DUDE!  You give her a new dish and comp it.  You don't ask her to eat something she never ordered!  That's just basic Restaurant 101."}
{"text":"The most authentic Sichuan food I had so far in Toronto. I went with friends on Saturday. I wanted go again the next day. But they don't open on Sundays. (Crying in my heart)"}
{"text":"This neighbourhood eatery has an upbeat atmosphere with lots of light from the windows onto the street and poppy Chinese music which adds to the modern ambience. We ordered beef and broccoli, eggplant with pork, and a special fried rice with shrimp, egg, and vegetables. Although these are fairly Western style dishes all three were tasty, well seasoned and the portions were very generous. We liked that the water was served in white metal mugs, what we would call \"Trapper mugs.\" But these mugs have an image of Chairman Mao embossed on them. In spite of previous bad reviews the service was pleasant and the food was delivered quickly. We didn't receive rice bowls which would have made eating easier. Jasmine tea was served in tall clear plastic jugs--part of the modern cach√©. There is a 5% discount for paying cash. We would go back again."}
{"text":"Made my first visit to Neighbor Wang today. I was most undewhelmed!  The decor was basic, but clean, although the chairs are MUCH too low for the tables. The staff was very slow and hesitant. They behaved like deer caught in the headlights of a car. I came in and asked for a table for two. I told the waiter I was waiting for another guest. The waiter waved in the general direction of some tables. As I waited he continued to ask what I wanted; I kept telling him I was waiting for someone and would not order until she arrive. This seemed to be a foriegn concept. He shrugged and disappeared, never to be seen again.  My guest arrived and was seated. After about 10 minutes I had to flag down another waiter for help. We asked a couple of question to which he had no idea of an answer. Finally we just pointed!  The food arrived in reasonable time. While was hot, it was lackluster!  We finished eating and then waited for almost 15 minutes and had to flag down yet another server for a bill.  We will never return."}
{"text":"3.5/5  I had seen this restaurant in the neighbourhood and had been meaning to look it up on yelp/try it but never did. On Saturday, we happened to pass by, hungry and cold, and decided to just risk it and try it. After we sat down, my partner looked up the reviews and they looked pretty bad (3/5 on yelp -- as it is now), so we prepared ourselves for something crappy.   We were pleasantly surprised! I ordered the sichuan dan dan noodle and it was really good. I ate the whole thing and nearly drank all the soup. It was a little spicy and had a mix of pickled veggies (don't know which kind if is, but it's a pretty classic chinese one) and peanuts in the broth. A bit salty, but i liked it anyway! My partner got the pork belly stir fry (the rice dish, which is available until 5pm and just has a smaller portion of the stir fry and comes with rice. The size is pretty generous). This dish was pretty good -- a bit too salty and tasted strongly of soy sauce, but the pork belly pieces were good!  I liked the ambience of the restaurant. It's really well-decorated and they had nice relaxing music in the background.  The only thing that I really didn't like was that, when they brought over water in mugs, one of the mugs had peeled a bit at the bottom (inside, not on the outside of the mug), and you can see a bit of rust.. Yikes. no rust water for me please.   All in all, they have pretty unique dishes for the area. I would go back and try again."}
{"text":"we had really good food here, and enjoyed  elegant environment here... and we ordered zhajiang noodles and dandan noodles .They are tasty."}
{"text":"Okay, I'm not even going to joke about the name. Apparently, the owner's last name is actually Wang.  This restaurant was pretty much what I expected. Mediocre Chinese takeout/fast food at slightly high prices.  The beef and broccoli was average. The desserts are less than impressive - don't do it.   However, the soup noodles would be your best bet. Wonton noodles was a huge portion and looked pretty good!"}
{"text":"The food is quite tasty, the decoration and style of the menu is very out of the ordinary and creative. I would recommend this restaurant for some good Chinese food."}
{"text":"Been there three times. Will go back for more. Portion is good, fairly authentic, never too crowded when I go. Free wifi too!"}
{"text":"Initially I was really excited to try out Neighbour Wang after seeing they had ???? (Chongqing Spicy Noodles), a rare thing in Toronto. Sadly, my experience with these noodles was even worse than the one's I have had on Spadina.  I must say that the service was much better than many of the previous reviews would suggest, however the meal left me feeling disappointed to the point of anger.  These noodles were incredibly bland. They consisted of the noodles, which were cooked fine, salted mustard greens, green onions, peanuts, cilantro, Beijing bok choy, a half a marinated egg, and chili oil. The only flavour was the starchy noodle water and chili oil, that's it.  Chongqing noodles absolutely need to have Sichuan peppercorn, which was totally absent. Normally these noodles would have soy sauce, vinegar, salt, MSG, garlic, cumin, pepper, and even more flavourings, to the point that the broth is not drank, this bowl instead came with a spoon! There was no meat whatsoever, usually there would be ground pork, even in a minuscule amount. Why Toronto restaurants make ?? with egg and skip the meat and yet charge high prices is completely puzzling to me.  As much as I wanted to try the snack items on the menu, I doubt I will be coming back. I ignored the bad reviews due to my enthusiasm for these type of noodles and was left thoroughly disappointed. ???????????????????"}
{"text":"Ordered the spicy vegetarian noodle dish (A02). It was tasteless, no condiments available & the server was hiding in the back somewhere. When I was a server, I busted my hump just to get a 10% tip. I give 15-20% tip when I eat out because I know what it was like to make ends meet on tips. Taking an order and dropping off the food is not doing the job. It takes continuous monitoring and checking in with patrons to make the whole dining experience memorable and enjoyable.   That's the major problem with new asian restaurants. They are unwilling to invest the time/money to train their staff properly. You can tell this owner is both NAIVE & IGNORANT about N. American service standards based on its inept staff.    When this place folds, and it will, let's hope the next business will be a big improvement.  I'm hoping for maybe something Ukrainian or Malaysian."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 0.... Not only is the service TERRIBLE but so is the food. I ordered the suggested mapo tofu with minced pork and braised mushrooms. I asked for no mushrooms and they served it to me with no meat and mushrooms. When I told the server, he said they ran out of minced pork. While this is happening, the other server is laughing his head off. I just want to add that half their menu contains minced pork. I'm convinced that they just didn't want to make a new one. My friend ordered a noodle dish with the tiniest portion of noodles and whatever else was in it. We ordered a side of dumplings that never came and was included in our bill. I would NEVER come here again."}
{"text":"The first time I try Dumplings on fire, it was excellent and tasty, the servers are friendly and refill the water timely, I would come back with my friends. Definitely recommend : )"}
{"text":"I had a buytopia deal expiring so I decided I'll try this place again. At the front door, they are advertising a chinese new year special where you get a free dumpling (presumably, a plate?) on orders over $20.  The restaurant is still brightly lit and clean like before, with lots of space to move around. The washrooms are a bit strange: you have one for men and one for women, but there aren't any sinks inside. Instead, there's a shared sink outside...  Before, they had these glass cups.This time, they upgraded to mugs with chairman Mao on it. Not sure what it's meant to represent.  This time I ordered the kung pao chicken and the dumplings on fire. I thought the chicken dish was alright. Pretty generous with the peanuts. Food was only somewhat spicy, which I kind of prefer over the ones where all you can taste is spiciness in your mouth.  The dumplings came out, but then the person that served it up suddenly came back a minute later to inform me that it wasn't made properly and will have it remade. Some parts of the skin did look a bit uncooked and I was sort of looking at it, so perhaps they noticed? Kind of interesting.  The dumplings came with a generous amount of peanuts as well to the point where you couldn't see what's under it in the pictures. There were 9 dumplings underneath though. The skin is ok, but I didn't like the filling inside the dumplings.  Portions are a bit small for the price, but there aren't too many other sichuan/chongqing places  in this area (closest is probably chinatown), so that may be something to consider."}
{"text":"Pretty decent Chinese food, the prices are a bit higher than I'd normally pay for in a Chinese restaurant for the quality of food you get (I'm also used to the uptown and chinatown under $10 life) but perhaps that it is because I also make my own meals, however I do think their portions are quite generous which is nice! To my current knowledge, their mapo tofu is probably the best on the menu. If you're a fan of spicy food, pork grounded and tofu, then you'll love it. I found the service to be quite good, they were efficient and accommodating to our group and we had over ten people and came at 8PM on a Tuesday night. Food and orders came fast, and the restaurant interior itself was quite clean and a cozy environment."}
{"text":"Nice place.  Ordered four dishes for two people.  Plenty.  Service was good.  Food came fast.  Free soup before dinner.  Some dishes were medium+spicy.  And we like spice.  Dumplings were great.  Four dishes, 36$."}
{"text":"Ordered Special Braised Eggplant Rice Dish and Fried Wings/Fries. The eggplant was too spicy compared to other restaurants. There wasn't enough rice so I had to hold that spiciness. Service was poor consider there wasn't a lot of customers. Waited a while to get a water refill. The wings were average and I skipped the fries as it's too dry. My friends weren't impressed with the food neither. Either too salty for the plate dishes or tasteless for the soup noodles. We were a big group so had to split into 3 tables. They had this New Year 15% discount for the whole table  if anyone were born on a certain year. Only our table didn't get the discount. On top of that, I was paying credit card so didn't even get their 5% discount for cash only. That's just bad business."}
{"text":"I get the feeling that there might have been shake-down/startup problems after reading other reviews. Our dinners were fine. Service was good, and the food better than expected. We were the only non-Asians there.  Had DanDan noodles, a great recipe. Rather hot for civilians, I liked it. My companion had the Kung Pao chicken, which he scarfed down like a starved sailor. Large portions here, and we found nothing objectionable and instead, quite tasty. It's a little expensive and Zagat isn't isn't going descend from its heavens and reward this place with its craziness. That's ok. We liked it enough to want to go back and try something else."}
{"text":"Worst Food Ever! It was too expensive (soup for $9, really?), the food was horrible, overcooked and in some places raw, got diarrhea afterwards.  I wouldn't mind to pay more for a great food but this was a disgrace!"}
{"text":"Huge portions and the food is always delicious. Recommend the spicy dumplings. The Sichuan Dan-Dan noodle is my favourite dish."}
{"text":"Not sure how this place is still in business. The service is horrible and the food is just as disgusting. I'm sad to say it brings Chinese food to shame!  Whenever I see these zha jiang mian, I always order them because they're one of my fav noodle dishes! However, I'm always surprised how some restaurants can make such a simple dish taste this gross.   They had small pieces of meat inside that were so hard and basically un-chewable! The noodles they used also weren't right...  I don't have much more to say about this place but definitely go elsewhere for your chinese food fix!"}
{"text":"This is my second visit and this urges me to leave a review. I really like the environment here in Neighboor Wang, though I don't know what the name means. They have very nice presented menu with a Toronto map at the back! And the drawing on the wall looks interesting. Also the whole decorations in this restaurant is modern and comfortable. The only downside is they don't have desert( the menu reads TBC, so I guess they're planing for that) I've had Ma Po Tofu, Kung Pao Chicken, Special Braised Eggplant(no idea how that's made), fried dumplings and dumplings on fire(that's my favourite!). The serving size is decent in this area. Two dishes with rice and one snack is more than enough for two people."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place after walking by it for months. Underwhelming experience...   The restaurant was empty when I first walked in (never a good sign) but I sat down anyway. The server brought me a cup of water from a table full of cups that have pre-poured water in them. My first thought was - really? You can't get a fresh glass? I just don't like the idea that all those cups sit out until someone comes in... think of all the things that can land in the cup. My boyfriend's cup even had rust at the bottom... not cool   We ordered 3 things:  1. Fried dumplings - 6.5/10 2. Sweet and sour chicken - 6.5/10 3. Schezuan dan dan noodles -7/10  Dumplings we're OK, but very greasy. The meat seemed a little pink and undercooked in my opinion also. Sweet and sour chicken was not so good either. The dan dan noodles were the best part and it wasn't bad but I couldn't finish it because it felt so oily. Prices were higher than I was used to for Chinese food.  If you're already seated at this place then I would say get the dan dan noodles, it's your best bet. Don't think I'll be coming back unfortunately."}
{"text":"Poor service, BLAND food and BIZARRE for a restaurant.  Waiter couldn't speak English well enough to speak about menu items or answer my questions about any aspects of any dish.  I decided on Sweet & Sour Chicken with a side of chicken wings as I thought a Chinese-food treatment of wings should be interesting and that I couldn't go wrong with such simple choices.  WRONG.  The menu was cheap, really thin paper.  Some items were crossed-out, presumably as they were no longer available.  If you are printing your menus at home on your printer, umm, why not just print up a new one?  The left side of the menu appeared to be the more expensive main dishes, the right side, the cheaper items that I think are starters -- dim sum stuff, small dishes, etc.  That seemed logical and since my waiter couldn't communicate with me, I had to guess.  The Sweet & Sour Chicken dish (with rice) came first.  Most boring version of it I've tasted ever since I've been eating Chinese food since 1980.  It is supposed to have a really sweet sauce balanced by the 'sour' (vinegary) taste.  It wasn't sweet or sour.  How do you get that wrong?  Then the side dish arrived 10 minutes later.  The wings dish was French Fries and full wings (not in bite-sizes as usually presented).  They didn't have any pepper in the restaurant to put on the fries.  The wings were coated in white flour and friend in canola oil, I could smell.  Unappetizing.  Not a spice to be seen the coating.  This dish, really, is a boring version of Southern-Fried Chicken.  Was not expecting that!  I figured I would go with the flow and eat the fries while they were hot since they are not good eaten later, and take the rest home.  I asked for a doggie bag.  I was told NO, they would not let me take the food home!!!  I had a half-price coupon through Buytopia since the restaurant was trying to get new customers.   I argued with the manager who refused to let me take the leftovers home.  I'd eaten very little, mostly the fries.  The manager said I had to eat it all at once, there in the restaurant if I wanted to use the coupon -- or I could just leave without paying which is what I did.  I was hoping to find a nice, good new restaurant but left puzzled and hungry and most unhappy."}
{"text":"Two years ago, I walked past a new restaurant having its grand opening. I waffled around going in and, feeling strongly the Student's Budget, I head home to make myself a meal. I got my chance yesterday.   Neighbor Wang is distinguished by its cozy environment, inviting atmosphere and staff, and beautiful decor. The menu was straight forward, filled with basics, which was disappointing. When my order came, however, I was pleased with the simple details that made each dish memorable.  I ordered four appetizers to share: (1) a shredded potato cold dish, (2) pork belly, (3) fried chicken wings, and (4) a standard green onion pancake.   (1) a common dish in China, every region does it differently. This variation had excellent texture, being cooked to the right bite and give which gave the potato more of a crisp vegetable texture than the starchy preparation we are used to in North American cuisine. Although dried chillies were used, the spiciness was surprisingly bright and built momentum, becoming spicier with every bite! Nice.   (2) fatty pork belly cooked, then chilled, then thinly sliced and topped with raw garlic, vinegar, soy sauce, and other spices in excellent proportion. Each bite was simple and delicious. Couldn't be better.  (3) I've always felt that Chinese restaurants serve up great fried chicken. Basic, unadulterated chicken with incredible depth of chicken flavor. Do they soak it in chicken broth or oil before cooking?! Not sure how it's done, but great nonetheless. Great crunch/crisp with each bite. They could improve on this by adding some spices, but it's fine the way it is. The fries it came on were mediocre, but easily forgiven. The size of the wings are also decent.   (4) Easily the saddest part of the meal. The dough has been over kneaded, giving it a flat, dense texture. Also feels like it was fried too long and there's barely any green onion! Not the billowy, chewy, and oniony fried perfection you would hope for. It came on a dish that was supposed to resemble a bamboo weave, which would have been nice for keeping the fried foods crispy and wick away the moisture. Too bad it was just a plastic plate with an imprinted design.   Side notes:  - noticed by the menu that their prices have recently increased.  - I am curious how they will do their spin on the noodle dishes. However, I wish they had less traditional offerings. Something to showcase their ability."}
{"text":"It seems that the spicy dishes will cause diarrhea, probably due to the spicy oil from China. The nonspicy dishes are fine and tasty."}
{"text":"prices higher than I saw online. service fast and friendly but food very greasy and not lots of meat for the price. nice ambient, atmosphere and location though. ample portion but not worth price with tax and tip. won't be back I think as I've tried what I wanted."}
