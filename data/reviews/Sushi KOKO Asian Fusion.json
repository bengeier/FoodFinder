{"text":"I went to Koko Sushi and was not impressed at all. Tempura batter was not light and tasted different from the usual tempura I have in other Japanese restos. The red dragon roll was not what I expected. We asked for tea refill and we had to remind the server twice. I have nothing good to say about my experience at Koko Sushi."}
{"text":"Dropped by here the other night. I had the butter chicken. It was outstanding. The owner said it was a recipe from his grandmother. Friendly service and reasonable prices. I'll be back to try some of the sushi dishes."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I was not happy with the quality of food that they serve at this restaurant.  I suggest to improve for your customers to return.  I'm one of those that will not return!!!"}
{"text":"Nice try with these \"paid reviews \" You paid ppl to write those worst sushi ever \"oceans \"xquality of sushi there's a reason why the place is empty ."}
{"text":"So my fianc√© and I visited some friends in Mississauga this past Sunday and decided to grab a bite on our way back home after we gassed up. Came across this sushi fusion restaurant. Ordered the soft shell crab roll, butter chicken and Korean short ribs. Everything was delicious.  We sat at the sushi bar so we got a chance to chat with the Chef. He was a very nice guy and told us stories about his country.  He let us try three types of pickles that his grandmother made from scratch.  The butter chicken was the best I've had in awhile.  My only complaint was that there wasn't enough rice.    At the end of our meal, he let us try the chocolate sushi...what a delight!  Definitely an unexpected great dinner at the small restaurant close to the gas station.  I love it when we find good eats in the middle of nowhere."}
{"text":"They've closed now anyways.  The location is now a much better Korean restaurant with an extensive menu comparable to that of the former Chung Gi Wa.  Honestly, I only ordered take-out here and swore I wouldn't return.  They upped the prices significantly, and their menu was basically solely adequate sushi at the best.  There was barely any selection, and nothing hefty enough to satisfy a full meal.  I can't comment on customer service since there was minimal interaction, but as of yet, I am disappointed in the availability of dishes, and the quality, considering the price tag."}
