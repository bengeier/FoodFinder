{"text":"Five of us went out for dinner.  We tried the fried yucca with cheese and sirloin (Yuca Cuzco Dos Sabores/Yucca Two Flavors), unfortunately the sirloin was missed on the dish, otherwise it was an interesting appetizer.  Yucca reminds me of a potato, so we basically had a potato with a tiny amount of cheese inside.

The rest of the dishes were good and very filling.  
Chicken Inka
Lomo Saltado/Sauteed Beef Tenderloin - served on top of fries.  I would have been happy if it was only served over the rice that was on the side.
Arroz con Mariscos/Peruvian Paella  - Came with full shell fish.

Unfortunately the food came out one at a time, so we had to sit and stare at each other while we waited for the rest of the food to come out.  We did not get the chance to try the sangria, since they had run out.  

Since the restaurant just opened, I would like to give them the benefit of the doubt and try again in a few months.  The food was delicious, only a few things needed to be tweaked."}
{"text":"Mediocre food. Bring out dish different than ordered because they are out and didn't tell us in advance."}
{"text":"This was our first time at Pollo Inka. The food was great. The atmosphere is non existent but the waiter was nice and fairly prompt. The prices were reasonable and the wait time for our entrees was short. The most disappointing thing about this restaurant was the smoke and grease smell from the kitchen. I would consider take out from here in the future but not dining until something is done about the ventilation."}
{"text":"Delicious food in clean and casual atmosphere.  Pleasantly surprised at the depth of flavor. Plan to return!"}
{"text":"An unpretentious little restaurant on the West side. This was my first sampling of Peruvian cuisine and I was uncharacteristically conservative in my meal choice. I got the house specialty \"Pollo Inka\", which is basically a rotisserie chicken, but a well done one. The whole chicken is reasonably priced at $9 (other dinner entrees were in the $10-15 range), with a nice blend of 15 spices. Nothing too exotic, but juicy, tender and tasty...very tasty.
For the side, I got some tostones, or fried green plantains. Nicely breaded, served with a yogurt like sauce for dipping (or so I assumed - I'll dip fried stuff in just about anything). 
Decor is fairly non-descript and the kitchen is divided from the dining room by a dessert counter. The service was quick, friendly, and cheerful. I like a place where the staff genuinely seems to want you to come back.
I'm looking forward to some return visits. I only gave it 4 stars, but if some of the other menu items taste as good as they sound, I expect to change it to 5."}
{"text":"Great food!  I'm Peruvian and this is excellent cuisine.  
I had a 1/4 chicken breast, rice, beans and plantains.  The chicken was marinated in an incredible mix of spices, it was baked, golden, moist and juicy.   The rice, beans, and plantains were cooked to perfection. My whole meal with a drink was under $14.  
I had the pleasure of meeting Chef Maritza, she's the reason that restaurant is so good.  She's a perfectionist on the quality of her product.  I highly recommend Pollo Inka."}
{"text":"Just walked by this place last night (1/22/11) and it's now closed. It doesn't surprise me given my experiences there. I'm hoping a great new restaurant opens up soon."}
