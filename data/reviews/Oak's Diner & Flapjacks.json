{"text":"Clearly I have been living under a rock for the 2 years that we have lived just 6a few miles from this gem because we never even knew it existed!  The husb and I are big breakfast people and back in ATL, we had TONS of breakfast joint options.  Here in North Scottsdale - not so much.   The husb and our friend Matt are training for a triathalon and decided that after their bike ride, they were going to run down through Cave Creek at which point myself and Matt's wife would meet them for some breakfast at Oaks.  We were seated immediately and glasses of ice water were instantly brought - good thing because the guys were dying of thirst.  They also had Vitamin Water which made the husb happy.  The menu had tons of options for typical diner fare.  I ordered scrambled egg whites and pancakes (my weakness).  Husb asked for eggs and a grilled chicken breast which wasn't on the menu but they were happy to oblige.  The food was so delicious that  I actually got kind of nostalgic for Jersey and the Manalapan Diner on Route 9.  I judge a breakfast place by their eggs and I was not disappointed one bit!  My egg whites were light and fluffy and not the least bit greasy.  Husb said that his chicken breast was perfect as well.  Our friends were very happy with their meals as well.  Top it off with the fact that Oaks is inexpensive and my Sunday was made!  We will be back - soon :)"}
{"text":"Consistently great food and a large menu.  My family goes here at least 4-5 times during our weekly visit to Cave Creek each year.  Hard-working and friendly staff.  Packed on the weekends but it's a large place so we've never had to wait even with a large group.  Favorites among our group are the Cave Creek omelette, French Toast combo, and oatmeal."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite breakfast places. Also must be many other people's, too...because they get busy on the weekend mornings! It's nothing fancy - down home, home-cooked food. Heavy on the grease, the carbs, and everything else we probably aren't supposed to eat. But they have healthier choices also.   What makes this place is definitely the service. It wouldn't matter if I went in every week or once every several months, they make you feel like they remember you every time! Very friendly, quick and efficient. The servers seem to always be the same, and they have impressive skills when you consider how busy they are from the time they open, through the lunch hour.   Prices are certainly reasonable, and the portions are large. Every time we've made special requests when ordering, they've been executed flawlessly. If there are any events going on in Cave Creek or Carefree, prepare for the place to be busy."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast experience, everything from seat yourself, no nonsense service service, hand written tickets and the wide variety of menu items. I'll definitely be back to try your Southern Fried Chicken on Waffle."}
{"text":"Always looking for good breakfast fare so I brought my wife and two young children based on Yelp reviews and what a disappointment. Menu items were expensive for a hole in the wall place with no ambiance and NO air conditioning (outside temp was about 90) so it was uncomfortable inside. My breakfast hash was dry and little more than chopped corned beef, biscuits (homemade and good) and gravy (gluey and I could taste the flour) overall they were mediocre. My son had crepes which were horrible and a juice glass sized chocolate milk ($2.50). My daughter had french toast which could have easily come from a box. The bright spot was my wife's egg white omelet which she liked very much. My wife and I shared her side of flapjacks and we expected more from a place that includes it their name. Another bright spot was our waitress. BTW the oven was broken so the two house pancake specialties were not available. Total bill for breakfast was $48.00 not including tip. Hate to say it but I would have been happier at IHOP and I hate IHOP."}
{"text":"It is not a bad place at all. I love the small town feel it gives you when you are seated. Kinda of like sitting in a bigger version of Lara ingels mother's restaurant on little house on the prairie. But anyways the chicken fried steak is awesome especially with the sausage gravy yum. The rest kinda bland but if you survey the normal clientele you will understand why ( old enough to be little house extras). But all in all not a bad place at all just will not be my go to but may return."}
{"text":"We sat out on the patio on a Saturday morning and it was so peaceful. I had the Atkins carb friendly breakfast so I'm gluten free. The turkey sausage was tasty but extra greasy. Pretty decent. My husband got bacon and eggs. Personally I thought his bacon was amazing because it wasn't burnt and it wasn't dripping. For a breakfast spot it wasn't too shabby and I probably would come here again."}
{"text":"\"Waffling\" between a 2 and a 3. Our server was so nice and did all he could, but one person can not serve all tables (inside and outside), bus them, be the cashier, and make sure customers receive service. It took a really long time to get menus. and coffee. and order. and our food. When our food did come, the pancakes were cold, but everything else was relatively hot. No coffee refills. At all. Every table outside was dirty, except one other, where other confused potential breakfast eaters landed. I don't know if they every ordered. They sat there for such a long time, as well. Huevos rancheros were pretty good, pretty standard. I'd give them a 3.5 (but...I must add disclaimer...I lived in New Mexico for a bit...) This wasn't the first time we have been here. Each time we visit, the service seems to slip little by little. I do hope they can fix this personnel problem and get a few more trained staff on the floor. Might improve things exponentially."}
{"text":"One of the worst experiences in my life! I've been here in the past and the food was pretty good! This time...... I could not even get seated. There were only a handful of people seated, but the waitress would not seat us. Finally after 10 minutes she came up to us and said in a snotty tone \"can you read\" I was a little puzzled... And said excuse me.... She said I guess you still don't see it......ok, I thought... Then she pointed to an obscure little sign that said seat yourself and just walked off. We sat at the table for over 10 minutes and she never even glanced in our direction! I will never go back!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Oak's Diner!  Besides the excellent breakfast chow the staff is incredible.  Everyone here is always bright and cheerful...which is always a great way to start the day.    My wife loves the omelet's because they have lots of fresh veggies.  I like the Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs.  They have a great selection of breakfast overall.  If you have the time they even make Apple Pancakes.    The bottom line is my family always feels good and is smiling when we walk out the door!"}
{"text":"My husband (the sexy beast, that he is) and I got up to early on a sunday and decided to sneak out for breakfast instead of  the entire family tagging along. Mean? Heck no! It's rare when we can get away ourselves and talk! Anyhooo back to the review. It was a nice drive for us, not to far from NW Glendale, and not a lot of traffic. After reading the reviews, I was afraid the place would be packed when we finally got there around 7:30 am. Nope. We were able to choose our booth and a guy came over and handed us menus and utensils right away. It was a toss up between the spinach and artichoke omelette with holandaise or the the cave creek omelette with bacon,jack cheese and avocado. We went with the later and asked for our hash browns crispy and subbed out blueberry pancakes for 2.00 more than the buttermilk pancakes that came with the omelette. We also ordered the apple pancake and planned on sharing everything. The apple pancake does take about 20 minutes, and they let us know so we would not wonder. Our server was an Asian (Korean, I am assuming the owner) lady, that was not wearing the standard red shirt everyone else was. She was very polite and took care of us without being overly attentive. I like that. I want my drinks re filled when needed and asked once during my meal if everything is fine. But I don't like when servers come around constantly. So this was good.   The food arrived with good timing. My husband loved the omelette, I thought it was ok. Next time I want to try the spinach. I am not big on avocado in my eggs. But thats just me.  The omelette was cooked perfectly and the hash browns that came with it were crispy, but not burned. And not greasy! EXACTLY the way I like them! The blueberry pancakes were very good. Large fresh blueberries. I do like more blueberries in mine, but my husband thought they had enough. Now, the masterpiece was the Apple Pancake. OMG. I LOVED it. Custardy, fruity, cinnamony (is that even a word?) crunchy on the outside and soft and not overly sweet on the inside. I could eat this as a dessert!  The coffee was standard restaurant coffee. Tasted fine to me. Not gourmet, but not bad.   I would go back again. And I can see this being in a regular rotation with Ronnie's in Glendale. I did take a star off because I felt for the breakfast items it was a bit pricey. The place is nothing fancy, but that adds to the charm. It was clean and easily accessible and plenty of parking. Our service was good and so was the food! Good grub!"}
{"text":"We used to really love going to Oaks on the weekends for a family breakfast, but sadly over the past year it has just circled the drain.  The food hasn't really changed, it's still the greasy spoon type breakfast food you would expect, but the service is atrocious.  Unfortunately it appears as though the owners have taken to hiring their kids (literally) as servers and unfortunately it seems like they really don't want to be helping out in the family business.  Getting your drinks, a menu, a refill, hot sauce, your order taken, etc doesn't seem to be on the list of things they would rather be doing.  It's a shame, and I am sure we will still go there occasionally but we certainly don't really look forward to it like we used to.  It's not really representative of Cave Creek."}
{"text":"I can see how this place could get really busy.  We went a couple hours before closing and had great service and food!  The price is right and the portions are big!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The service is good and the food is great! The pancakes are amazing! I love the blueberry pancakes and pecan pancakes so much! I also love the southwest omelet which comes with hash browns and two pancakes which I usually add blueberry or pecan to, depending on what flavor pancakes I want that day. This place is great for Breakfast but don't be surprised if you have to wait to find a seat because this place can get very busy, and that doesn't surprise me since the food is absolutely amazing!"}
{"text":"Strange. I posted before about great blue berry cakes. Today 3 pancakes and maybe 10 blueberries in all. Sad.  I will try again but I will be cautious and reiterate what I want. Friendly  service but forgot lots of requests"}
{"text":"If you're looking for diner food, that's diner quality, then this is the place. It's everything you would find at a typical diner. The staff is very friendly and kind. One of the guys sat down right in the booth to take an order from the table next to us. Our waitress was friendly, prompt and attentive. The ambiance was that of a typical dinner --I thought the place was cute, both inside and out.  The food is edible, but nothing beyond that. The food is diner food, and frankly, not even good diner food. I had an omelette and my son had pancakes and bacon. The bacon was so brittle that it just crumbled. My son thinks ALL bacon is good, no matter how its cooked, and he wouldn't touch it after one bite. The hash browns that came with my omelette were partially burnt. The omelette was OK, but nothing special.   That being said, my dad LOVES this place and thinks it's the only place worth eating breakfast in town. Different strokes!"}
{"text":"Great little diner, divey little place with amazing food and I always love our waiter or waitress.  \"you want some more coffee sugar??\" haha anyways I love coming here for a easy breakfast, you have to try the german pancakes, it takes 20 mins for them to bake so tell them when they take your drink orders and then by the time everyone else's' orders come out it's ready!  I've never had anything other than breakfast here so I think I'll have to give that a try in the future."}
{"text":"We used to come here all the time. Before the prices got higher, the portions got smaller, and the quality of food and service went down.   We visited here a few weeks ago for my birthday weekend, we had a new girl who worked there. Ok, no problem, but wow it was a little rough. We told her we were ready to order and she took our menus and walked away.   The things we always get there were cold, and not very good. The bill was of course $35 for 2 people, and waited up front for a solid 5 minutes before the guy came to ring us up.  I would much rather head to another breakfast place in cave creek. We will not be coming bad, which is sad because we used to come here every Saturday morning."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped in 3 days ago for a late breakfast (10:30 am) while visiting from out of town. We love finding local businesses to support when out of our normal routine, and thought this place looked to fit the bill. Sadly, the experience we had will further hinder any future visits.  When we arrived there was a sign telling you to seat yourself, which we promptly did. The establishment was not even half full, and of the empty tables about half of them still had dirty dishes from previous guests. Ignoring that, we found a booth and waited for menus. Wait we did. We clearly saw two people running the orders and food, but kept passing by us. I thought perhaps I missed menus by the entrance, so I got up to try and find them, that did not exist.   After nearly ten minutes, a man approached us \"Have you been helped yet?\" No friendly greeting, no solidly for waiting... He got us menus, took drink orders, and left. In the meantime other tables have entered, that were very quickly greeted in a friendly manner. Another 5+ minutes go by before he returns to take our meal order.   As we wait for our food, the other tables (that arrived at least ten minutes after us) are now eating their food. Annoyed as we're now adding things up, I see the woman working is filling up coffee at all the other tables, I jokingly told my boyfriend \"I hope she doesn't run out before she gets to me!\" as my coffee was empty, and sitting at the edge of the booth. As she left the booth behind us, as walked by our booth, she turned her head to the back wall (with no customers) and completely ignored me. The coffee pot was not empty.  Our food arrived, as others were already finishing their meals. The food was not bad, that is the redeeming 2 stars compared to one. Portions were decent, and for a diner, it was as I expected it.   As we ate, the man \"helping\" us started bussing some of those long empty tables with very old dirty plates. I need to know what brand plates they use, because if he somehow didn't break any from how aggressively he was bussing them, I'd be amazed. All we heard were loud crashing dishes, and slamming silverware. Not professional in the least, made me pretty uncomfortable actually.  We finished eating, went to pay, and again...waited a long time to pay. There was hardly a thank you. Honestly, I'm glad this wasn't my first impression of Cave Creek, because it is a lovely town, but if you're not a regular you will not feel welcomed here."}
{"text":"We love this homey diner tucked into the old west backdrop of Cave Creek that serves up delicious moist pancakes on their own or accompanying any other entree. It's also a fun place to people-watch as you will see all kinds dropping in for their morning fill-up! I always get a good belly laugh when I look around the room!   Sometimes the service is a little slow to start, but it is basically seat yourself so when they are busy, I can understand it being difficult to figure out who just sat down. No worries . . . once you order up, you're in great hands! The servers are friendly and patient (especially when I have a difficult time making up my mind) . . . and they always have lots of newspapers to read if you're sitting at the counter!   The choices are plentiful and so are the portions! As many times as I have been here, I still haven't gotten up the nerve to order the oven baked apple pancake, but it looks and smells so yummy! I'll need a full six-top of friends and family to help me with it . . . but I will someday (hopefully sooner than later)! The omelettes are also cooked to perfection and when I ask for my hash browns well . . . I get them very well, thank you.   Not only is Oak's Diner and Flapjacks a great place for breakfast, but it's also a fun way to start off your day exploring the Old West of Cave Creek!"}
{"text":"For the love of heaven, clean the place up.  Unfortunately for me I was there when the heat kicked on. I'll never be able to forget all the dust and who knows what coming out if the vents. I recommend checking out groupon as they are always offering deals on vent cleaning.  What is that giant glass case that takes up the front quarter of the restaurant?  Unless you intend on sharing the space with a jewelry store that remnant of history needs to go. It serves no purpose that I can tell other than taking up space and collecting that abundant dust coming out of the vents. Staff is okay...they have their moments, but expect to get up and ask for things like ketchup or togo containers especially if you have limited patience.   I really want them to get their act together because the food is very good, but it takes a backseat to all the other problems this place has.  And no, they don't accept Apple Pay.  updated 3MAY15...against my better judgement and the fact I was overruled by my wife we went back for breakfast this morning.  We decided to sit outside today and were welcomed by some filthy dirt/bird feces covered tabletops.  Once that was cleaned up I placed an order while everyone else decided what they were going to have.  My food came out, I ate, and the waiter hadn't even come back to take the rest of the order.  I went and got him to do that.  Second round of orders in, restaurant at this point is about half full.  After over 20 minutes of waiting I got up to go see how much longer it would be to find the kitchen window completely filled with plates of food and nobody bring it out.  Tracked down the server again and told him our food was ready.  Food was good as usual, but service is pathetic.  Asked for an extra plate when food was delivered, but after nearly 10 minutes I had to go inside to ask for that.  Three out of our group of five ran out of water and was never offered a refill.  We ended up with some leftovers so I asked for two togo containers.  Opened the first one that had dust, hair, and a dried coffee stain inside which at that point I lost it.  Told the wife the only way I'll come back here is as ashes after I'm dead.  I'd fit right in with all the dust at least.  Again it's really sad because the food is good, but with pathetic service and filth it's simply not worth the frustration and health risk."}
{"text":"Great flapjacks (aka pancakes) and eggs. If you're in the Cave Creek area, well worth stopping in"}
{"text":"Pecan pancakes are on point! My girlfriend had the pancake and eggs combo with side of bacon which was also delicious."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go when you want a basic breakfast in Cave Creek. It is an \"old school\" restaurant where the locals seem to eat and linger over breakfast. It is a little hidden from the road (it is at the back of the  parking lot across the street from the Circle K).  We enjoyed the Early Bird Special - $5.95 for 1 egg, hash browns, choice of meat (ham, bacon, sausage link or sausage patty) and toast or pancake plus coffee and the February Special - $8.95 for steak & eggs, a nice steak cooked to order, two eggs any way, hash browns and two pancakes or toast. Everything was great and cooked perfectly. The early bird isn't a huge amount of food (so hearty appetites should order extra or something else) but it was the perfect amount for me.   We've had breakfast here three times. Each time we had friendly service and consistently good food.   One day I'll return for lunch."}
{"text":"I had pancakes, eggs over easy and ham. The eggs and pancakes were great, I would pass on the ham. Not enough servers."}
{"text":"We had Casey as our waitress and she was absolutely delightful! Wonderful service and the perfect cave creek experience."}
{"text":"We had high hopes for this local breakfast location. The place was very crowded and with their \"seat yourself\" policy it makes for some uncomfortable situations when people are standing around your table waiting for you to get up and leave because there's no where else to sit. We finally got a booth by the door after wandering around trying to locate a spot and the wait was on. Our perky waitress was very pleasant and explained a few things we had questions on and brought our coffee right away. We put in our order and then got to watch other tables who came in after us get their orders taken and their food brought out rather quickly. The table next to us showed up almost 10 minutes after we did and they were almost done eating by the time our food arrived. We were right on the verge of leaving when another waitress asked if we'd like our check! I said no, I'd like my food. Our waitress was outside bringing other people their meals and refilling coffees while we sat and watched others enjoy their breakfast. When everything finally arrived it was warm, not hot and my chicken fried steak with eggs, hashbrowns and pancakes was mediocre to say the least. My other half enjoyed her huevos rancheros. All in all, not the place to go if your in a hurry or don't mind drinking 5 cups of coffee while you wait for your food and get to see others eat long before you get your order."}
{"text":"If I am driving from Buckeye to Cave Creek on a sunday morning so that my wife can have her favorite pancakes... 'Nuf said!"}
{"text":"This is just a good ole spot to hit up for breakfast. Nothing fancy or shiny, just solid food from the eggs and pancakes to the constantly fresh cup of coffee and polite, attentive service gets me coming back again and again. Yes it is a little bit off the beaten path (unless your path cuts right through Cave Creek) but worth the drive in a town where great little breakfast spots are far and few between. I have never had a bad experience here and plan on having many many more in the future.  The place is priced right, the portions are generous without being excessive and there is a good amount of variety on the menu. It is casual and family oriented, and the service by committee gets the job done. If you are looking for a good breakfast spot and you are within a half hour drive, I say make the drive and have some breakfast goodness at Oak's."}
{"text":"Oak's is the greatest breakfast place in Arizona. I will never get tired of the questions pankcakes or toast on the side. Pancakes always wins, always. Stay hungry my friends."}
{"text":"Stellar! Stellar Service! And - be sure to remember - if you show up and its packed - look to your left when you walk in - the \"faux-counter\" is always open!  Huge Menu-Great for hangover breakfast!  Mercy - fabulous waitress!  Get the Baked Apply Frenchtoast - the 20 minutes to make are totally worth it - your coffee cup will remain hot and full!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast at this establishment on Valentines day this year.  All around a entertaining and enjoyable experience. Our server was energetic, happy, hilarious and attentive. The food was spot on as well, I am not sure the last time I was compelled to order a chicken fried steak and eggs at 10:00 am but after a little encouragement from our server I took the leap, and I am glad I did. I am not sure if they were the best ever, but they were very close. The steak had a well seasoned batter and was very good, My eggs over easy were perfectly prepared, and and believe it or not my meal came with three delicious light and fluffy pancakes. My girlfriend, had the biscuits and gravy and they were well above average, light flakey crust, and delicious gravy. Oak's is a perfect location for the home style breakfast of your dreams, but Oaks does not provide me with memories of its ambiance, if you are looking for eggs with a view, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"I've eaten there several times. Only once have I had a decent meal. Ate there this morning and they couldn't cook my eggs properly. I ordered over medium and specifically asked for no runny whites but runny yolks. The first time I got my eggs they weren't even cooked. The second time they brought them out they were cooked so long that they were hard as rock and it took 10 minutes. By the time we got the second batch of eggs the rest of my food was cold. Instead of offering me a whole new meal she offered to put it in the microwave. Then when I complained the second time she said what do you want me to do about it. Won't be going back there ever again. And by the way that was the owner of the restaurant that asked me what do you want me to do about it. There is a very foul smell outside the front of the restaurant from the grease pits."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in Cave Creek. It's a little hard to find - there's a Circle K on the north side of Cave Creek Rd with a Print Shop across the street - turn into the Print Shop parking lot, Oak's is just behind it.  OK, on with the review.  This place has a definite diner vibe. If you're looking for a fine dining breakfast with snooty waiters then 1. you came to the wrong place and 2. you came to the wrong town. But, if you want really good service and food - you have arrived!  I've had a number of menu items here and I never go away disappointed or hungry. My most recent visit was a western omlette. It was pretty big with a lot of veggies, etc. inside.  It came with hash browns and two pancakes. I couldn't finish it.  The omlette was nice and fluffy but oh those pancakes - a bit of crisp on the outside and oh so fluffy on the inside. My breakfast partner also had an omlette and we both had coffee. Total tab - about $30. More than reasonable."}
{"text":"Good breakfast place in Cave Creek. Just off the main drag. Rustic western diner ambience with friendly staff. We sat outside on the side porch with a view of Black Mountain. Food is all-American diner. Good portions. Excellent pancakes. I'd become a regular at this place if I was a local."}
{"text":"Granted, I had a simple sandwich, but what makes a simple sandwich into an \"experience\" is the staff, who was tremendous!  I was here for the Cave Creek Wicked Pet Costume Contest.  These people could have been irritated by our \"special requests,\" but instead were so very gracious!  My first request was water...totally free, yet served as though I had ordered it with a full meal.  My second request was lemonade...and the server served it with a smile and an offer to provide free refills.  My third request was lunch, a BLT.  The server offered to bring it to me in my booth outside!  When she brought it to me (quickly, I might add), she even remembered to bring the ketchup for my fries!  And finally, on my last visit inside, they were already closed, but she offered to bring me a fresh water anyway.  How great is that!!!?"}
{"text":"Just ok  Understaffed and service is very so-so.  Food is very average and typical of a Denny's."}
{"text":"Baked apple pancake was horrible ... Not worth the wait . Nothing was fresh  ..,no flavor"}
{"text":"Owner is CRAZY! I found a toenail in my breakfast and she accused me of putting it there WORST SERVICE EVER"}
{"text":"Old school diner... Yes! If you like all the ambiance of an old school breakfast and lunch diner... this is it! Their breakfasts are fantastic. Right now they have a special for a steak and eggs breakfast for $8.95... 2 eggs, steak (and not a small itty bitty steak, it's a pretty decent portion for the price), hashbrowns, cowboy beans, and pancakes or toast. Let me tell you, if you want pancakes... Come to Oak's. These have to be the best, fluffiest, melt in your mouth pancakes ever. I AM ADDICTED! Has to be the best traditional breakfast up here in Cave Creek...  I always look forward to going in and having something new, but right now I'm obsessed with the steak and egg special. Do not expect gourmet food, this is down-home, grandma made it, style breakfast. No frills, good food. Looking forward to updating this as I continue to frequent."}
{"text":"Spoke with 3 different people to get a menu after sitting for more than 20 minutes. Nobody seemed to care that we were even there, could not even get a glass of water. We left and went to Grotto. What a terrific place that was. We will never return to Oaks diner. One more thing. I was so disappointed with my experience that I loaded the Yelp app to rate my experience so you know I am serious about my review. I would have given it negative stars but as I am new to Yelp, I don't know if that's possible."}
{"text":"Slow service, average food, no ambiance. Good thing I was with a good friend so it didn't really matter anyway. Based on price this is probably a good value for a family breakfast out."}
{"text":"Food was not too bad except eggs were a little less than over med and they buttered my toast which I had asked them not to do.   I was served my food quickly infact probably a little too quickly because that's when the details get over looked.  It's a hustling staff in the am though and nice setting.  Next time Ill try the flap jacks :-("}
{"text":"My breakfast needs are simple--two properly cooked over-medium eggs, well-browned hash browns, toast that doesn't taste like \"cheapest our restaurant could buy.\" With good coffee. And I have nothing against eating in dingy dives if the food is average or better, and priced to reflect the dinge. The Oak didn't really deliver on any of that. The egg whites ran like snot; the pale, limp hash browns were sodden with oil (not even liberal dousing with hot sauce could redeem them); and the sourdough toast tasted like any cheap white bread. No meat, but I don't think I missed anything special. Kind of felt like I had a mediocre $5 diner breakfast that I paid $8 for--and didn't finish because it didn't taste good. Our waitress was perfectly pleasant, though. For point of reference, I'd been ordering the same breakfast at our Carefree hotel for the same price, and the hotel's version was cooked better, plated more attractively, was similarly abundant and served in a much more attractive space, with better coffee, more comfortable seating, a bit of scenery and, actually, much more attentive service."}
{"text":"Found this place based on a review from the AllTrails app! I think it's fantastic! Service is wonderful, and the pancakes are a must! I've eaten here two days in a row!"}
{"text":"Ate breakfast yesterday, and enjoyed it. Wife had early bird, and I had the apple pancake. Mine was almost too big but very tasty. A little too much cinnamon for my tastes. Tom was a hoot. Nice friendly people. Decent prices for cave creek area. Not cheap by our style of living out in the mid-states area. But they cook better than most restaurants out there."}
{"text":"I would give Flapjack's five stars because of their enormous variety, originality and wonderful service HOWEVER, I do agree with other reviews that this place is overpriced.  Despite this, if you are looking for a good local meal & you don't mind a higher price, this is a good option.  Their food is pretty straight forward diner fare; Pancakes, eggs, what not.  The atmosphere is a bit rustic and fits the feel of the cowboy town.  The diner is a bit small, so get here early if you have a bigger group and don't want to wait, especially on the weekend mornings."}
{"text":"This place has the most amazing Blueberry Pancakes! They are soooo good, with real, plump blueberries dropped right into the batter! Why this is so amazing to me is that I have never, ever, seen blueberry pancakes served like this in a restaurant ANYWHERE in AZ. Normally, blueberry pancakes come with the overly sugary blueberry compote that is used in pies, dumped on top of greasy flapjacks. They make the pancakes like I do at home.  I could eat this dish every Sunday, because that is when Oak's serves breakfast ALL DAY! They are open everyday from 7 a.m. - 2 p.m."}
{"text":"I would give negative stars if possible. I got so sick from eating here. 2 days of vomiting and diahreaha that put me in the ER for extreme food poisoning. STAY FAR AWAY FROM HERE! Trust me it's not worth the food poisoning. Plus my food looked like it fell on the floor before they picked it up and served it to me. Very rude staff and the price was way way to high for the poor service and food poisioning. AVOID. NOT WORTH THE TROUBLE. McDonald's has a better breakfast. Good luck."}
{"text":"Perfect breakfast cafe for hungry women. And lots of bikers.   Our waiter was friendly, kept the drinks coming, and got all of our orders correct.   The food was tasty diner fare--waffles, pancakes, omelettes, hash browns, bacon, etc.   We ate so quickly we forgot to take photos."}
{"text":"Think Andy of Mayberry meets Flo's diner. Great breakfast place in the heart of downtown Cave Creek. Huge menu with lots of choices and just really good basic not fancy food. The pancakes are truly some of the best I have ever had, especially the German Apple pancake. Homespun good ol boy type service and the countrified atmosphere make this a must try destination that is well worth the trip into Creek Creek. PS only place I've ever been where you can actually get extra crispy hash browns....yummu!"}
{"text":"I went here with my family on a Sunday morning about 930am. The place was pretty packed but we got a table fast. We waited over 30 mins to have our drink order taken. Inexcusable by my book. Once we ordered our food it took another hour for our waiter to get it out to us. I got the chicken fried steak & eggs & it was not very good. The gravy had sat so long it had a skin filmed over It. Disgusting. The hashbrowns were either too burnt or to soggy & I had to drench them in ketchup. My glass was empty by 1/2 threw & was never refilled. My mom had to go up & refill her own coffee because the waiter was so not on top of things. I would never go here again. I don't see what the fuss is about. Id much rather any day go to \"the place\" in glendale."}
{"text":"Hubby loves this place, me? Not so much. The seat yourself option makes you feel like you have to rush out when there is a line at the door. The food is decent, but the decor is worn out and not the cleanest place I have ever been with lipstick on the overpriced glass of juice."}
{"text":"As a local business owner, I do not recommend this place. From the moment I walked in the door, the kid that greated us looked like he didn't want to be there. He was also on his phone. The food is terrible. Bacon looks fake, eggs looks like the kind from mcdonalds. Dont understand why people go to this place. And our wait for a simple breakfast was unacceptable. I rarely write reviews but people shouldn't waist there money here. Go to Wagon Wheel down the street. Thats a real breakfast and costs less!"}
{"text":"Do you like breakfast with a side of meth?  Perfect.  It's a greasy spoon breakfast place. The decor is dated and the tables are sticky.  You seat yourself and have to pay up at the register. No big deal.  This place has been around forever and will probably continue sticking around forever more."}
{"text":"They had great choices and amazing service. It was just the right breakfast after hours of kayaking and hard work camping on Bartlett Lake!"}
{"text":"Great experience. The restaurant was busy, so we had to wait, but not too long. Once seated, we had a friendly waitress, good food, tasty coffee, and a nice breakfast. The prices are fair, so we will return in the very near future."}
{"text":"Way understaffed and service well that is another story it needs work.  Food is could be better. The  only thing is that the German pancake 20 minutes wait and are good.  They charge for substitution when you don't want the potatoes  Example $ 1.00 for  mixed fruit instead of potatoes.  The prices are very high already and you want  extra dollar for stuff I am already paying in the base price. I think I will go elsewhere."}
{"text":"We were hoping to find a good spot for breakfast on the far north side of town.  All of the good ones, aka Over Easy, Matt's Big Breakfast, etc are all south bound for us to drive.  Oak's Diner & Flapjacks was recommended to us by a local in Cave Creek.  It seemed busy enough, so our new breakfast adventure was a foot!  This place has a an older dinner vibe to it with loads of locals, you can tell by the hugs at the door when peeps walked in.  We were directed to a booth and told, \"I'll be right with you\".  At times these are the words I fear the most especially when places are busy.  Well, 15 minutes later I had to ask for service.  (I wasn't giving up on this place)  Someone showed up and took our order.   I ordered an all American-guy kind of breakfast - heavy/greasy and full of carbs!  I had eggs, hash browns and corn beef hash and a side of (according to their menu) award winning flapjacks.  My wife went healthy and order egg white omelet with spinach and a side of fruit.  My son had a stack of flapjacks.  We got our meal fast however we were grossed out by our server when we got our food.  She had the dirtiest hands I've ever seen on a woman, eeyuu gross!!  Food: ~ Eggs were fine, hard to mess up eggs ~ corn beef hash was like saw dust with no potatoes... Very dry and dust-like  ~ Hash browns were very basic and plain.  ~ Their flapjacks tasted, meh - Pillsbury or Betty Crocker taste as good or better.    End result of our breakfast adventure in Cave Creek is meh, still looking for a good breakfast place on the north end."}
{"text":"Awesome service!!!! Great food!!! Alex along with the others are really good!!! Please stop by and see for yourself!!!!"}
{"text":"I decided to join yelp because of this place. Came in for brunch today, the place was busy and and had good vibe. Everyone was friendly but that's all there is to this place. The wait staff was all over the place. We had to grab someone 20 mins after we sat down to place our order. We saw what appears to be our food sitting at the food window. It turned out to be ours after sitting there for a good 10 mins. An hour after sitting down we finally got our food which was mediocre at best. It's a lot of food for the money but I'd rather take my money elsewhere. They were apologetic and food was on the house but we're not coming back."}
{"text":"Overall:  I love this place!!! Its always crowded but its great for people watching! There are sloppy people, fancy people, athletic- just-got-off-my Cannondale bike-people, motorcycle people, old people, young people, famous people. You name it. The food is awesome, especially the homemade corned beef hash! Ask for a side of gravy!!!! Eggs are awsome. Husband LOVES their pancakse and crepes. Service is great. Servers look like older bike chics and they call you honey and darlin and I love that! Always topping off your coffee.   We are always stuffed after we go. You can sit outside with your dogs. The place is not fancy at all and looks like they decorated using everything from a couple garage sales (which they probably did)but I just love it.  They are famous for their German Pancakes too. They could give you more than one sausage with the Sunshine plate but oh well. I love it.  PS They are always taking collections for the owners dog that needs eye surgery but I have a feeling they have been collecting this money for some time now and if the dog needed surgery, she better of had it by now!! Afterwards go visit Elvis the camel and his friend,! Drive west on carefree highway, make a right on 7th Ave, and go a few blocks until you see the camels on your right. Feel free to park and go pet them and say hi!! The owner doesnt mind at all, just dont feed him. Camels have sensitive stomachs! Unlike me!!!"}
{"text":"Yay!  Another place to add to the breakfast rotation!  With the BF residing in North Phoenix, there are not that many options when it comes to finding a good breakfast spot in the area.  So, when we were craving a hearty meal last Sunday morning, we went on a mission (to Cave Creek) to find somewhere new to add to our existing rotation of Kashman's, The Good Egg, The General Store, and Einstein's Bagels.  We found it at Oak's!  Unfortunately, we aren't the only ones that found it...  The place was packed when we walked in, but it was the kind of packed where it's a good sign!  It was warm and cozy with a positive energy in the air.  We put our name on the list and the hostess brought us both coffee.  Jared, being the aggressive guy he is, found us two seats at what Oak's considers their bar (I think), so we ended sitting there instead of waiting for a table.  Ice waters arrived immediately and the menu had all kinds of eggs, pancakes, waffles, French toast, and more.  I ordered the harvest (wheat) pancakes along with an egg white omelet - yes, they have egg whites too!  Jared went with the French toast and ate my hash browns.  Everything was served with melt in your mouth butter and syrup.  We cleaned our plates, it was that good!  Needless to say, we've agreed to add Oak's to the breakfast rotation.  If you don't mind the trek to Cave Creek, go check it out for yourself.  With a huge menu of items to choose from, there is something for everyone... kid friendly too!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast.  The place was slammed on Saturday when we were there.  The food is delicious and the employees are pretty nice.  This is a totally laid back atmosphere that serves wholesome, hearty food.  Unfortunately, even though I parked in the furthest spot from the restaurant when we returned to my car after our meal, we noticed that my new car had been hit."}
{"text":"Oak's buttermilk pancakes, how do I love thee?Let me count the ways. I love thee to the depth and breadth and height My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight For the ends of Buttery Richness and ideal taste.  I know not how they achieve the salty, creamy, sweet flavor of these humble-looking flapjacks. The perfect crispy brown exterior gives way to reveal the perfect middle that is neither too cakey nor too thin. No need for additional butter and one considers foregoing even the cheap supermarket syrup which rather detracts from the beautiful perfection of the cakes.   I can't speak for any of the other menu items aside from the fried eggs I order with my pancakes-- perfectly fine, by the way. Just go for the pancakes and forget everything else. Maybe I can smuggle some warm maple syrup in next time I dine there. Hmmm...."}
{"text":"I'm staying at the Care Free Resort and find the resort's restaurant to be overpriced. I based my decision to go here for breakfast on the 1 review before mine and it did not disappoint.  the waitress there  is super friendly and welcoming, she's a great person to chit chat with and ask for advice on what to do where to go.   The food is pretty darn good! If you're looking for a good, affordable breakfast menu, this is the place to go. Pancakes, eggs, toast, biscuits & gravy, omlets, etc. . .  You can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Three of us walked in this morning and sat down.  20 minutes later, we still had not been approached by a server or anyone else for the restaurant.  I got up, politely told one of the servers we had been waiting for about 20 minutes and could I at least get some coffee while we waited.  He said they were busy.  (Never even gave me hope to at least get some coffee). I told him I noticed about 4 other tables enter and get served - even ordering food off the menu.  They appeared to be regulars as the waiter and waitress knew those customers.  He just shook his head again and said they were busy.  I sat down for another 5 minutes, then we left.  Bottom line, if your'e not a regular, you get crappy service.  The worst service and rudest wait staff I ever experienced.."}
{"text":"Just a nice place for breakfast. Always good food, rarely a wait. Service is eh. Iced tea is eh. The eggs, bacon, chicken fried steak, home fries always good! It's a locals joint in the midst of touristy cave creek. Don't make a special trip. But if you happen by for breakfast you'll be a happy camper."}
{"text":"Wish I could give 4.5 stars.  Quaint little spot in Cave Creek with very pleasant and expeditious service.  We came specifically for the Dutch Apple Pancake.  What a delicacy!  More of a dessert than a breakfast.  I thought it was perfectly done--and not too sweet or overpowering.  Their other menu items look great as well.  Everyone was very professional and happy.  Definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Doing the Cave Creek thing. We all have. Cowboys, rodeos, bikers...you know you have. We just wanted some simple breakfast. This place had the most cars in town. And the town is like two blocks large. We had some plans for the day so wanted easy in and out. Place was, um, dingy, felt like I was somewhere in Pennsylvania where dairy farmers rule. Decor from the 70s, peeling paper, stained brown carpet on the floor. Newspapers piled on a microwave in the corner. Are you following? It's a local joint. The food was cooked like any diner food. The services was good. Everyone knew everyone and there were plenty of well-off Cave Creekers there eating. Would I go back? Sure. Would I bring a date? Heck, no. The Boulder's Grill better choice for that."}
{"text":"This is exactly what you picture when you think local diner. Not the nicest or cleanest of places (cobwebs hanging from the ceiling over the pass blowing in the breeze from the ceiling fan) but the food is pretty solid.   The oven baked apple pancake is totally incredible and sooooo worth the wait but the bacon was over cooked and inedible.  Service wasn't the greatest, but wasn't too horrible either.  Go for carb loading pancakes, just don't look at the ceiling."}
{"text":"4 stars for the food only. Went on Sunday and it's was packed. Service was terrible. Your torn between feeling bad for the wait staff who have to do everything and being annoyed when you wait 45 mins for just your drinks.  Go on a weekday and be patient"}
{"text":"I am shocked that this place is still in business! The waitress was new, give her a break but wow it kept getting worse. It took forever to get drinks and food, when we got our food it was not the right stuff and they forgot some. I had a hair in my hashbrowns as well. Another waitress came to help, which was their own saving grace. I will never eat here again! Yikes!"}
{"text":"I am from Chicago and have enjoyed awesome Breakfast eats, such as the Original Pancake House, Walker Brothers and Burnt Toast.  Since moving to Scottsdale 2 months ago, I have yet to find a good place to eat breakfast.  My husband and I decided to look for a place in Cave Creek to eat, since we love the atmosphere in this town.  We ate outside and my husband had biscuits and gravy that were 6-10 stars, a little bland.  He had a King Kong omelette that was ok, but it was hot and fresh.  I had the German Pancake, and had to wait 20 minutes (but they warn you ahead of time).  This pancake was absolutely delicious.  The pancake is crispy on the outside and soft in the inside.  It is served with fresh lemon, syrup, butter and powered sugar.  I also had the corned beef hash, which was very dry and overly salty.  I wouldn't recommend it.    The service was friendly, but if you sit outside it may take a while for them to greet you.  I'd definitely eat here again.  They also let you bring your dogs if you sit outside!"}
{"text":"The homemade cornbeef hash for breakfast was delish!  The customer service was outstanding!  We will dine again."}
{"text":"From the outside this looks like a little rustic gem just waiting to be explored.   Upon walking in (you seat yourself), the place is old, dusty and in desperate need of a face lift.   There's a Christmas tree at the front counter, a spider looking \"thing\" hanging from a cashier light that quite frankly looks like they rescued dreadlocks from the trashcan.   Tom arrived to take our order. \"Water all the way around\" was announced.   Did I mention the AC wasn't working?? Well neither did they. It was a brisk 108 outside.  A few ceiling fans and one floor fan going and that was it.   It should be mandatory (especially in AZ) they tell you when the AC isn't working PRIOR to ordering so you can then decide on whether you're going to stay or not.   I asked the young girl if they could turn the air down as it was incredibly warm. When she went over to adjust the thermostat Tom advised the system was blowing hot air.   We didn't find out the AC was broken until were almost leaving. Soaked in sweat!!!  Food was tolerable at best.  Once food was delivered; we never saw Tom again.   For the prices you pay ($10.95 for a BLT with three pieces of bacon and half a head of lettuce) you'd think the food would be better quality.   Well mark that off the list of places to try."}
{"text":"Good pancakes. Eggs and breakfast burrito I would say are just ok. Not sure why all the rave reviews."}
{"text":"It looks a little scary, but don't let the carpet on the floors scare you. The food was fantastic. I would eat here again."}
{"text":"Went for a morning Motorcycle putt to this location about a month back. Nice people. Good food. Great service."}
{"text":"Very large but basic breakfast menu.  Food was fine, (flapjacks were tasty) but nothing exceptional.  Prices typical for the area...not dirt cheap, not expensive.  Atmosphere is old hippy/funky.  Servers are very nice, but seem overwhelmed if it gets the least little busy.  No hostess in evidence to seat diners.  Loved the pet-friendly patio with water bowls and also small dog \"beds\" (cushions)...sweet touch."}
{"text":"The food is great!!  The Pancakes are outstanding and the eggs are always cooked to perfection.  I would enjoy this place so much more if their coffee didn't taste like hot water.  I will be back for breakfast.  The service is fine."}
{"text":"Great place to eat breakfast. See my pictures for more info on the food we got.  It does get busy so come with patience.  All local people so it's great to support them when they do great food.  Not sure why people rated low just because they had to wait because that is a good sign to me!!!!  Won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Love this place. Come here once in a while for breakfast and we all love it. The German pancake is delicious!"}
{"text":"There is nothing chic about this place but don't be put off by the truck stop charm.  The service is great thanks to a delightful waitress named Candice.  The pancakes are sooooooo good!  The first time I had the full breakfast (eggs, bacon, hashbrowns & pancakes).  Every time since then I have only ordered pancakes...They are simply too good.  I don't even usually like pancakes...I never order them any where else.  Other nice thing is they let me bring my own small portion of real maple syrup!"}
{"text":"Above average diner food. Hash browns and bacon were the stand-outs for me.  I had heard a lot about their pancakes, but IMO they fall way short of what Heart 'n Soul Cafe has to offer in that department.  Still a great place if you're looking for that stereotypical \"greasy spoon\" diner breakfast."}
{"text":"How cute is this place?! It's a bit of a hike to Cave Creek, but we wanted a change from our regular routine. We headed to the Oak's Diner on a Sunday morning-not too crowded and we were told to seat ourselves. Very friendly waitress and plenty of seating. Feels like a diner for sure. Great menu and very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"This is a classic greasy spoon dinner. If you like huge portions of standard breakfast fare (omelets, pancakes, waffles), this will hit the spot.  Our big complaint was the coffee. Very very weak. They said that they just got a new supplier for coffee and blamed the watery brew on this.  They were nice enough to take our coffee (which we didn't drink) off the bill."}
{"text":"Love the diner, nice atmosphere, great food, priced right, friendly staff, take a few steps off the main drag and feel like one of the locals!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Clam chowder was too runny and lacked clams. Service was friendly but slow after the initial order. Perhaps I'll sit inside next time.  I'll be back, but not before I try a few other places in the area.."}
{"text":"Entered the restaurant and the server made my group comfortable my shaking our hands and complimenting my daughter's outward beauty.   Breakfast was excellent (Cave Creek Omlette, fruit, and Flapjacks). More smiles than excuses makes this one special diner."}
{"text":"Delicious baked apple pancake! It was so big and amazing and even though I said I wasn't going to finish it, I ate the entire thing! It had just the right amount of flavor, spices, and texture. Four stars was given because service was pretty slow. We knew the pancake would take a while but it definitely would have been nice to get some refills on the drinks. It was lunch during a weekday so I'm not sure what the excuse was. Staff was nice though."}
{"text":"I had a craving for pancakes and had read many good reviews about Oak's pancakes so I decided to drive up to Cave Cree and try them.  Upon entering the not so busy restaurant, I was greeted by the lovely owner Oak, who told me to sit wherever  would like.  I got there by 12:30 pm and there was plenty of room...  Looking at their comprehensive menu that lists both breakfast and lunch items, I noticed they had crepes on their menu and decided to give them a try instead of the pancakes  was dreaming about.  Well, my choice was excellent. I ordered the crepes with blueberries and they were scrumptious. It came as an order of three crepes and  I could really tell that the batter was made from scratch. The crepes were served rolled up with blueberries inside and they were honestly to die for.I was almost tempted to order another set but the owner Oak funnily sad to me: \"Oh no, don't do that, you'll be too full.\"  Oak the owner was a sweetheart and queried whether it was my first time there.I replied no that I hadn't been there and nearly six years to which she replied: \"How come you haven't been here in that long ? Come back okay!  She was delightful with her Korean accent.  The service was marvelous and the coffee was also delicious. Enjoy a bottomless cup for $ 1.95. Definitely will be back and that time I will try the blueberry pancakes for sure."}
{"text":"Visited Oak's again while sightseeing. Since we're both on special diets, we ordered the chef's salad. Huge, but we finished them! The waitstaff was very friendly & when we asked, offered suggestions on what to see in Cave Creek & Carefree. Again, good food, great service!"}
{"text":"Came in for breakfast and the place was just about full.  We were told to sit where we could.  During the 30 minutes we just sat there at a dirty table, 7 other tables were cleared and cleaned.  People sat at all 7 and their orders were taken.  Finally an older guy waiter finally asked if we had been helped (it was his area we sat in) we said no and he tried to brush the spilled syrup off the table then said he'd need to clean it.  While watching him on his phone getting water for another 5 minutes he came back.  I asked him if he could clean the table.  He walked off and came toward us stopping at an empty table to handle the money left on their check and we had enough and walked out.  The food is usually good and the service usually isn't.  I think we're done here."}
{"text":"The people were friendly and the place was quiet when we arrived (late morning on Monday). Prices are decent and the atmosphere is basic and \"homey\" - nothing avert or obnoxious. The menu was a good variety of basic breakfast foods and the portions were good sized. The food itself is decent - think a better version of Denny's - nothing too greasy or cheap, but nothing over the top \"yummy\" either (except the hot chocolate which was perfect!). Nice place to stop if you want some basic comfort food. I would have loved to try the baked pancakes, so if you have the extra time (takes 20 minutes), stop by - they sound amazing and is probably the best item on the menu if I have my guess."}
{"text":"Nice in expensive dinner style place with decor to match. Very casual and nice selection. Good food and large portions with a wide variety of choices. Service is a bit so so but I think our waitress just had an off day."}
{"text":"Not bad, but nothing to rave about. I got pecan pancakes with a side of sausage links. Both were ok and pretty standard. My mother got the sunrise breakfast I think it was called? She liked it. My toddler daughter got some little silver dollar pancakes which she actually ate some of, so I call that a success. Service was prompt and friendly.  Overall it's a solid place, just not stellar."}
{"text":"Good breakfast!  Nothing fancy but all the traditional stuff done right!  Seems like a family-owned place. Very nice people. Would come again."}
{"text":"If you don't want to wait or incur any problems, go early in the morning or at noon and not on a weekend. The food is delightful, I'm working my way through the menu. The service we had was wonderful. The cafe is small and rustic which gives it charm. Yes, this is a cowboy town where everyone is laid back. The cafe is in an out of the way area with plenty of parking. This place gives meaning to stop and smell the cactus flower."}
{"text":"Another great apple pancake - slightly burned around the edges this time, but still edible. At least,...I ate it!  What I really like about this particular apple pancake is that it isn't terribly sweet. It has a nice amount of cinnamon sugar atop it and the apples are sliced perfectly and taste fresh. The dough is \"just right\" and I usually eat half to a quarter of this thing - the person with me eats about a 1/4 and then I have at least a 1/4 to reheat, pour maple syrup over (because by nighttime, I usually want that \"something sweeter\") and to eat with vanilla ice cream as a nightcap. That's my kind of day!  Why not five star? I don't know...just a feeling. Our service/experience is always very good, just not \"perfect.\" I've tasted other items on the menu and they're good, but nothing that I'd go out of my way to get. The apple pancake though - five star! Just a heads up - it is $10.95, but worth it."}
{"text":"Wife and I stopped by for brunch, we sat ourselves, breakfast was good, not amazing but good. Waitress and staff we observed were very nice and pleasant.  Mgr attempted to be pleasant but was not a customer service rock star...we just didn't feel the love.  The other issue, and I am sure it will be corrected..is that my wife was unable to use the Ladies room, the door would not latch or lock.  Great little spot, pretty clean, good a mix of generations, locals, and tourists.  If not for the feel or mood we sensed from the Mgr. I would have added another star.  We will try it again, food was good,  it was probably an off day."}
{"text":"Delicious comfort food for a great price. Great place in Cave Creek for breakfast. It's definitely a hole in the wall tho, expect a dumpy old setting but the food is worth it! Nice waitresses too!"}
{"text":"Great little breakfast casual breakfast joint hidden away in Cave Creek.  Omelettes were fresh hot and super fluffy. Coffee was hot and delicious and always refilled.  Of course we had to order the German baked apple pancake. And boy did it deliver. Worth the long (seemed extra long the morning of our visit) wait. Thick and baked to perfection. Oozing with cinnamon and sugar and tons of apples. The edges were nice and crispy with a soft fluffy center. Went home with plenty of leftovers too."}
{"text":"Went with our son, grandson and hubby.  I was full and didn't order but all the guys had a great breakfast!  My husband and son had the SW omelet w/ chorizo, cheese and other goodies and it looked great.  My husband liked the pancakes and hash browns (and he's picky!)  Our grandson, who is only 2 loved the kids' chocolate chip silver dollar pancakes.    Homey, nice waitress and good food!  Next time I'll make sure not to eat to much of my own breakfast at home since I saw they also have some healthier choices on the menu!"}
{"text":"Great food great people they even gave us complementary apple fritter it was awesome I will be back"}
{"text":"Old time place. Perfect for breakfast. There German pancake is awesome. Feel old time cave creek here."}
{"text":"I would rate this place 4.5. The food and service was great. The place itself is a little run down and older. But my husband thinks it gives it charm. The waitress was very sweet."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast! Ordered pigs in a blanket and loved it. The breakfast sausage was as big as a polish sausage and the pancakes are homemade - very light and flavorful. The service was so-so, the restaurant was very busy. Our server was so rushed, we had to ask for things more than once. Even with the rush, though, the food came out quickly."}
{"text":"Dirt parking lot leads you to this place which is offset from the road and not easily observed unless you knew where you were going.  The booths are oak of course, with a few ordinary tables set up towards the back as well.  Service was very, very slow but friendly.  At first I was ignored (nearly ready to walk out), then was unable to place my order after having the menu for a considerable period of time.    Buttermilk pancakes were among the better ones I've had in Arizona.  They were golden brown, light and moist on the inside, but also had enough weight to them for adequately soaking up the butter and syrup.  Menu offers a very diverse range of breakfast items, including oven pancakes.  I'll give them another chance in case the service was an anomaly, and it did help that my server was convincingly apologetic.  Review score is largely based on the pancakes."}
