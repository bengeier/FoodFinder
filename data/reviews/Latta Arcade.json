{"text":"Should be called Latta Arcade / Brevard Court.  Over a hundred years ago, there was a small alley connection Tryon St with Church Street. More than likely it was called Brevard Court. In 1914, one end was enclosed into a two story pavilion called Latta Arcade but to this day, the two run together and hard to do one without the other.  We came down on a nice spring day a couple of weeks ago and visited the restaurants/bars and shops of this area. We had lunch at The French Quarter which is the entrance to the Brevard Court entrance on Church St. I think the reason it's called the French Quarter is that the atmosphere reminds you of NOLA because the cuisine certainly doesn't  Nice place to socialize and get a good meal and maybe book a trip someplace or just hang out.  It's only a short walk to the Football Stadium, the Basketball Arena, the cultural museums and art galleries and or course, Romare Bearden is right across Church St.  Great place to be and back in the 1970's prior to the advent of the other venues, this was the place to be in Charlotte"}
{"text":"Pretty-looking inside and leads out to restaurants.  We were told offices are upstairs so we didn't go up there.  Small businesses are using the space (suites). Looks bigger in photos but very tiny."}
{"text":"An historic little mall!  This little shopping area is over a century old. It looks like it. It looks like a time in Charlotte's history before cars ruled the roads. Down the center of the public space, a pedestrian street takes you past local ethnic restaurants. You can get Chinese, Italian, Scandinavian, and many other foreign cuisines. There are a few offices and barber shops in here as well. I really enjoyed the fact that all the shops are local businesses. No chains in the entire place. Yum! Parking is easy, it has a parking garage right next to the place.  The place is quite nice, beautifully decorated, and a fun walk.  I enjoyed checking out the old pictures of Charlotte by the entrance on Tryon Street. They date back almost as far as the Latta Arcade."}
{"text":"Latta Arcade is a neat lil place its kind of like a small indoor mall of sorts with a variety of places to eat as well as a few barbershops. I walk through here just about every morning on my way to work.    Its a good place to come check out for lunch although its probably best to get it to go as seating in the arcade is very limited!    Only negative really is. That it closes down at 6pm."}
{"text":"The Latta Arcade is such a unique space in that it has a rich history - I am such a sucker for it too!.  You can definitely tell how dated the building is by the building's design, but what I love walking through here is seeing the natural light come though the skylights and how the storefronts are compact.  I don't believe there is A/C either, but I think the building is designed to move air through it enough.... it does get warm at times, but it's actually a nice break from the \"overly\" air conditioned-modern buildings in Uptown.    The Arcade is celebrating it's 100 year anniversary so it is crazy to think this space has been here since 1914!  Though I have not tried all the places in here, I can tell you that the line for Crisp is usually out the door.  When you walk though the arcade the nice outdoor courtyard opens up to more shops and restaurants - probably the best one is The French Quarter, but the new Viking place is actually growing on my \"go-to\" list for lunch.  Great for people watching, but there is a lack of seating in the building itself since everything is so compact anyway.  Ask the shoe shiners though, I bet they see all kinds of things during the day."}
