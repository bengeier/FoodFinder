{"text":"Great lunch special choices - add a couple spring rolls and a drink for less than 2$ extra. Had the chili chicken with hakka noodles. Nice heat, not overwhelming. I was asked with sauce or dry - if you don't like your noodles swimming in sauce then ask for dry or on the side."}
{"text":"Terrible food and terrible customer service. I ordered the shrimp pad Thai for delivery which I was only able to have a few bites of before I began feeling sick. I called the restaurant to complain and I was not offered an apology, a refund, or even a credit. I will never order from here again."}
{"text":"Good place. Huge fan of the Gan Ban Crispy Beef. Get it everytime. Everyone I've introduced the dish to loves it as well. Recommend!"}
{"text":"It's one of those places you go to when you don't wanna go out to eat but don't wanna cook. Food is okay for the price, but tell them to go easy on the gravy or they literally drown you with it."}
{"text":"It takes a lot for me to give someone a 1 star but I cannot make myself give it anything higher. The food was not bad - pretty much like any other Hakka Chinese you might go to. The service was HORRIBLE - quite one of the worst I have experiences. The server had attitude from the get go, starting with taking our orders. When she started to bring out the food, she was busy on the phone (clearly a personal call because she stayed on that phone the rest of the time we were there). She never checked in on us to see if everything was ok. We ended up going up to her to cancel one of the dishes we ordered because we had finished eating and the dish still hadn't come out (she forgot to order it). She didn't bring us the check, we had to go ask for it - the entire time she's on the phone. Definitely not a place we'll be visiting again. I recommend you find another place."}
{"text":"Came by this afternoon, a couple of minutes to 3:30. I believe the sign on their door said their lunch special ran from 11-3:00 so when I walked in I was pleasantly surprised that the menu at the front desk said 3:30. 

I ordered the chilli chicken for my husband, their veggie stir fry for my sister and their chilli shrimp (spicy) for myself.  The chicken and shrimp came with an either dry or wet option, I went with dry because the girl taking my order recommended it. I also upgraded to fried rice instead of just steamed rice for an extra $1.50 each dish. 

It took about 10 minutes for me to get the order. The rice was good. My shrimp were so tiny, i don't think I've ever seen shrimp this small ( & I don't know why, but I assumed it was larger shrimp) there were so many eventually I just started eating around the shrimp. Side note: extremely spicy. Even for someone like me who liked spice. 

My husband enjoyed his chilli chicken. It looked good. Didn't try it. 

My sisters veggie dish was so good. Quite saucy, but she enjoyed it. I liked it, there was more than enough vegetables (broccoli, bok Choy, carrots, etc). 

Overall, for $5.50 (+1.50 for fried rice) you can't go wrong. It would've been better if the shrimp were larger and maybe if I could add some veggies to the dish. But I didn't get that heavy feeling after eating the dish that I usually do when eating at take out Asian restaurants. Will come back."}
{"text":"great fried rice. good fusion between chinese and indian. go for the dinner specials like masala chicken on fried rice. from other places, I usually buy thai fried rice with chilli chicken for $15 but here I am able to get both a special put together but with a larger quantity for only $10..thats good value.."}
{"text":"This is one of those neighbourhood restaurants that you go to when you're too lazy to leave the area. I ordered the manchurian chicken which was okay, but I've had a lot better. In general I've noticed the quality for hakka food is usually just average - not exactly fine dining but even this place seemed to fall below average. The chicken could've been a lot better if they used actual chicken breast but it was pretty obvious that they use cheaper chicken scraps to make their dishes. You can really taste it in their food. The chicken had this weird crunch/chewy texture that you get from eating tendons and wing cartilage. At least they have nice big portions."}
