{"text":"Absolutely NOTHING bad to say about my visit today. Okay yes, there was a line up and we waited around 20 minutes to be seated but I knew that from reading all the reviews (and now you do too haha).   Anyway, it was three of us and this is what each of us had: 1) Dead Ringer with a side of Ex-Montrealer poutine and a small Oreo cookie milkshake. 2) Man-O-Wire with a side of Ex-Montrealer poutine and a regular vanilla milkshake.  3) Quesadilla (don't remember the name but pretty sure it's their only one) with a side of regular poutine and a butterscotch milkshake.  All orders came with a measuring cup filled with ice cold water and the milkshakes were served in measuring cups, as well.   I won't go into too much detail about the juiciness of the burgers or the excellent distribution of meat on the poutine but from all three members of this dinner, the food was DELICIOUS.   I will definitely come back but not for a while, I'm pretty sure I'm gonna stay this full till next year!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times before with happy results, but today was pretty bad. I made a special request to change a sauce on a burger because I am allergic to it. They put it into the computer as being what I requested but when I got home (my food was to go so I could get home to my newborn daughter) they hadn't made the change ai had requesed and my meal was wasted. Very disappointing. Not sure if there will be a next time here."}
{"text":"First and last time I visit \"The Works\"!  I ordered the Teriyaki Veggie Burger and my wife got the Nacho burger. Instead of the veggie burger they brought me a regular meat burger. Been vegetarian for 17 years but I guess that ended today after I took a bite and realized something was wrong. Asked the waitress and she said she didn't remember punching a veggie burger into the register and verified it was a meat burger. She brought me another burger and removed my burger from the bill. It was a nice gesture but still this was a pretty major error. She took the order with a pen and notepad but still it was enteted wrong.   Food took about 40min to be served not including the burger getting redone. The veggie burger they brought me after was fine but I wouldn't go back again. The food is ok, it's over priced, service is slow and you have to look before you eat."}
{"text":"I've been here about five times now, and a couple of times at the Oakville location... Every time we come here we are welcomed with great service and great tasting food. The menu can be very overwhelming for someone new, but the servers are always willing to explain it and offer their recommendations.   Being that Yelp is full of serious foodies, I won't give 'The Works' 5 stars (EVEN THOUGH I LOVE IT HERE!!). I'm giving it a 4/5 for the reason being that their burger beef is really nothing special. For a place that offers a TON of verity, I feel like they can spend a little more time developing a really unique recipe for their original beef burgers. Don't get me wrong, the burger is a lot better than a fast food chain, but it isn't a 'Burgers Priest'. They do offer different meat options - I usually end up getting 'The Leafs Nation' (SO GOOD) which is a chicken burger essentially, they also offer gluten free options.  Be sure to try one of their amazing apps, incredible sauces (I love the Beach-house sauce), unique beers and even their unique milkshakes... The Sticky Pig Sliders are exploding with flavor! Again, this place is filled with flavour, and the friendly warm environment makes it even more fun. If you haven't been to 'The Works', you're missing out."}
{"text":"We had such fantastic service when we visited the works. She brought so much light to the room and really made our experience unforgettable even though it was a quiet, cold afternoon. The burger, obviously was amazing, which by the way we recommended by the waitress! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"I have been there twice, despite not having a great experience the first time.  First time, very busy, long wait, seemed to be well handled until I had to take my son to the bathroom and saw numerous empty tables. Speed of service is not a priority in this place, and there's more on that later.   Got seated and were warned about the 20 minutes to cook the burgers. Personally, I think it's an excuse to sell over priced apps, like a stack of onion rings for almost $10. Measuring cups to drink from?  #FAIL  Rings were okay. Let's get to the main event, which as promised took forever. Burger was bland and flavorless. I'm talking the patty. It's adequate at best. Lots of choice for toppings, but you need to get the patty right.   And my son's burger came out raw inside. Not rare, not under-cooked. Raw. Think steak tartare. For a 4 year old. After 20 minutes plus. So I pointed it out, they took  it off the bill and offered something else for free, but we needed to go and couldn't wait another 20 min.   Went back again thinking its growing pains and we had bad luck. Same thing with seating. Burgers were well done this time, just as bland, but I had tastier toppings.  Again, service took a long time.  Very pleasant and helpful, but not worried about time at all.  Meh food for premium price. 3 adults, 3 young kids: $150 with tip. Way too pricey for mediocre food.   Hot tip for management: hire a bus boy and turn those tables faster, and make that patty tastier.   And I love hamburgers...it's too bad this didn't work out."}
{"text":"Burger selection is interesting. Tables are always too sticky. Prices way too high. Bet you can make a better burger yourself. Taste ok but not worth it when you see your bill. Order a couple of milk shakes and your bill for 2 will be over 60 with tip. Service is slow. Location is not the most ideal."}
{"text":"First time here. Great service by Spencer. Huge portions, with many bottomless sides and drinks, be sure to wear your elastic waist pants .  Good extensive kids menu. Highly recommend, will be back."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers. My husband and I ordered for take-out. I had the Dead Ringer and my husband had the Beverly Hills Lawsuit. Both were very good. I'd read earlier that the portions were immense. I did not find this to be true. At least not regarding take-out. Otherwise I would have given a 5 star rating. But I'd definitely say that if you're having a major burger craving that this is a place worth checking out. But the portions are disappointing."}
{"text":"This place is great for the wide range of toppings and sides i definitely wouldnt recommend coming here for a plain cheeseburger as the meat can be a little dry and flavourless. So be sure to get a burger with some cool toppings that you normally wouldnt be able to get at a regular restaurant (i love peanut butter) also the gravy on the poutine is a little on the salty side but still yummy!"}
{"text":"Been to a couple of these stores in Ottawa and fell in love with it up there. I have been to the one downtown Toronto and love it and thought we'd try this one, its a bit closer to home.   Service was great and food was fantastic. My burger was a bit undercooked but they fixed that with no issues.  Restaurant is the same as the others (same layout). Love how the drinks are in large measuring glasses, kids get a kick out of it every time. Great family restaurant."}
{"text":"I try to avoid chains, but I can't resist The Works.   I've been a fan since I first visited in Kingston, and their Beaches location does not disappoint.   Our server, Pat, was charming and extremely attentive as well as knowledgeable regarding the menu - truly a highlight of our visit.   You can't go wrong with the Tower O'Rings for an appetizer, and I had The Beach Boardwalk on turkey, instead of beef. I highly recommend trying their turkey burger - very moist and flavourful.   Tap list was short and uninteresting - a pity, since nothing goes better with a burger than beer. Sam Adams, Barking Squirrel, Moosehead and Cracked Canoe were all the pitcher options, I believe.   I'll definitely be back, since the food has been consistently delicious, and the service is top notch."}
{"text":"Been to this establishment a number of times and have to say that these are the best burgers I have ever had.  The onion ring tower is incredible and the dips that join these tasty morsels are also equally incredible.  The service is fabulous and the ambiance is very nice for a burger joint.....fries also very tasty.  They have a limited bar menu, but the beer they do carry is quite delicious.  HIGHLY recommend you to come here, and I once enjoyed the Elk burger and was pleasantly surprised!  Will go back again for sure!"}
{"text":"For starters, it was a good burger that I had. Both times that I ate there were delicious meals.  But as I saw on another review, narrowing down your choices can be difficult. It's a menu overload.  But the back of a waitress T-shirt does claim they have 70 burgers and 420 possible combinations for burgers from meat, topping, and bun. Bottom line: would I recommend it as a place for a good burger?  Hell, YES!!"}
{"text":"worst host staff i have ever encountered, told me that they could not serve us because they didn't want to \"overwhelm\" the servers. when we decided to leave to find somewhere else that could handle the customers we were met with a snarky \"okay, after you JUST made her clear the table!\" i will never be going back."}
{"text":"Great burgers, been here couple of times and never had a meal I did not enjoy.  Reminds me of the burger shops I grew up on and they have Killer Shakes and Onion Rings.  Great service to top things off.  Definitely returning, highly recommend."}
{"text":"I the choices are great, Its a good overall combination of classic  & gourmet burgers.  The portion was just right  Service was fine and on time."}
{"text":"This place gets all the glory by the looks of it due to its patio and burgers but the burger here is satisfactory not the best but not the worst and the toppings add a bit of a spin to the typical burger, I personally enjoy adding the \"spicy die-cut fries\" to my order and the onions rings are good too.  This place I went three times to give them a shot and what set me off was the terrible service that's consistent here for sure. I walked in and it looks like you're supposed to be wait to be seated but you'll just have to seat yourself and after waving to get some service and you'll have to wave them down for just about everything from ketchup to the bill."}
{"text":"I'm impressed, but not 100% sold. Its great, but for what I paid and what I got, I was a little disappointed. This place is pretty pricey, so be aware. Good food, but you end up paying for it.  I ordered the Down Under with Turkey, I loved it, but I found the menu very confusing. It was all over the place in terms of theme, and i saw 5 - 6 burgers with almost the exact same ingredients.  The fries are awesome, fresh cut and fresh fried, and the toppings are very fresh. The turkey was a little overcooked, but I was OK with that.   A down under burger, strawberry smoothie, pint of cracked canoe and 1/3 of a pickled willy came out to $31 before tip and taxes.  Id go back if I was hungry."}
{"text":"After eating Holy Chuck this spot has just an average burger with good service..."}
{"text":"Yumm yumm yumm!! The food is awesome here. My favourite burger is the Full Mounty and oh boy it should come with a supply of wet ones as it's so messy. The onion rings are made from scratch and soo crispy. The caeser's salad was over dressed but when I mentioned it to them they quickly brought me a new one with dressing on the side and it was delicious. This place is great for the whole family and for picky people as there's something for everyone on the menu. :)"}
{"text":"I had originally given them a 1 star and vowed not to go back. However, I was there a year later because of a work dinner.  Everyone around me had the beef, and elk burger. I've opted out for a veggie burger with portobello mushroom (switched out the cheese they've originally had with it for Brie instead) and accompanied it with a small side of poutine with pulled pork. I was pleasantly surprise how much I enjoyed it. What I ordered I would consider giving it a four star! Also, in North America I find vegan and vegetarian food taste like grass in most cases but when u go to different parts of South Asia and Asia vegetarian  food actually taste amazing and flavorful.  For me the veggie burger I had made sense and was great how they highlight the REAL fresh veggie and not something that's overly processed to make it taste like meat (like conventional veggie burgers and veggie hotdogs). However, everyone else had the meat burgers and was disappointed and the service wasn't great. Hence I only gave it a two star. they did change the menu and made it much easier to order. I was glad that  I gave this place an unexpected second chance :)"}
{"text":"Was so looking forward to a burger here. The selection is unbelievable! The poutine rocked and the microbrew beer was going down nicely. Burger arrived looking glorious. Took one bite, oh oh patty was dry, way over cooked and totally grey inside. Brought it to the attention of the server who informed me that they have to overcook it by law. Huh? \"So no medium rare or even the slightest bit pink?\", \"No sorry\"   YIKES!    Took 4 bites and gave up.   They supposedly use fresh grade A beef so why cook it to death? Did I go on an off night? Felt bad for the server he was great."}
{"text":"The food was okay, they screwed up the bun's with my girlfriends order. They serve drinks in measuring cups, not sure I understand the measuring cup, it seems cumbersome, heavy takes a lot of place on the table. I like they offer beer pairing with your meals. Relaxed pub ambiance."}
{"text":"Normally the burgers are good, but I went with my father and even though he asked for his burger well-done it came out very rare. He sent it back, and it still came back pink. You'd think after the first time you wouldn't screw it up again. We had to leave so he never actually got to eat a burger. Bad experience overall."}
{"text":"Didn't experience a lineup at all. Excellent waitstaff.  Overwhelming menu with lots of variations of condiments.  We ended up splitting a burger and upsizing the side to a premium poutine.  Burger was deeelicious.  The poutine was a tasty first bite then went downhill from there as salt overload kicked in.  Unfortunately, the water is not filtered so it tastes a little like licking lake ontario.   Though at that point, I didn't care since I was dying of thirst from the poutine.  After we ate everything, we both felt jus right.  Not too full.  I don't know how everyone else can eat so much food!  Overall, the one burger with a poutine side and millkshake came out to a whopping $35.  Tasty, but not for my wallet."}
{"text":"I like this concept burger joint for a quick and casual meal with friends.  The food and service is consistently good......not great.....but the space is very nice.  Limited and uninspired selection of draft beers is disappointing but the appetizers are good and the novel burger combinations make the meal a bit of an adventure.    My pet peeve is the management of the table turnover.  Tonight we were in a line about 16 deep.  There are three empty tables that just need to be cleared, cleaned and set which was obviously not a priority for the staff.  Most restaurants have this done to a science.  The Works appears to treat is as a casual organic process.  We could have easily been seated 5 minutes earlier.  This may sound petty, but the 5 minutes feels like 30 when you are waiting under hot lights watching the inattentive staff through the glass wall.  Will not go back during peak dinner hours."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I had so far! It was really delicious and the service was awesome. I will defiantly come back to this place and try the \"crush the bulldog\" drink again. Josh helped us and his friendly welcoming behavior with good knowledge about the menu made our experience even more delightful. Thanks everyone. Good job"}
{"text":"The burgers here are great, but if you expect good service go somewhere else. We came in 20 minutes before 12 in order to get in and out quickly. Took a half an hour to get our food. Several other tables who arrived later got their food first.   Attempts to flag down our waitress were unsuccessful in spite of clearly established eye contact..... Grrrr....."}
{"text":"Ok so I had to create a Yelp profile specifically to write a review for this place, I couldn't just not say anything after eating there. Please note that this place looks cool and the menu looks really cool and interesting however when your actually eating the food it's nasty lol. My husband and I ordered a burger and fries each for take out and the burger patties were like flavorless hockey pucks and did not taste fresh at all. We asked for lettuce pickle and tomato on the side and when we opened the container we got like 2 peices of wilted rotten lettuce and I pickle slice that appeared to be bitten in half. I got the Mac and cheese on the side and it was literally boxed Kraft Dinner that was all dry and clumpy served in a peice of paper which it stuck to. We paid $38 for the 2 burgers and 1 fries with 1 Mac n cheese side which I wouldn't mind paying if it was actually gormet burgers, sadly they were not. We will not return. Do yourself a favor and just go to the Big M's burger down the street it is fantastic you will not be disappointed like you will be here"}
{"text":"After both my husband and I received  raw burgers, never again. When I say raw I don't mean under cooked a bit...i mean R-A-W...the outside had just been browned. Yes, mistakes happen...but when I'm paying a higher price for a gourmet burger..I expect it to be...at very least...cooked."}
{"text":"Really? 3 stars on average? I've been there at least 30 times.  I love the food. I usually get the Art Attack (w/salsa, avocado, grilled zucchini and feta) and bold slaw (excellent) Putini (sp??) Martini is very tasty too although I bet it has million calories.  Staff always super cool and friendly.  I gave it 4 stars because often its too loud there and the burgers take at least 20 min to arrive."}
{"text":"The Works - the only place in the Beaches to dine in and get a decent burger! I don't like chains, this one is an exception... Licks (now closed) was serving up terrible food the past few years, Hero Burger on Lee serves up dry, tasteless patties - I am constantly surprised that there are people inside eating there... don't they know how bad it is??? Et voila, enter the works - friendly, clean, incredible quality, flavourful, interesting options and if you feel like really indulging finish off your meal with a choc PB shake... so so good.   The options are brilliant - if you don't want beef, have chicken, ground turkey or veg burgers, even can have gluten free... I am trying to think of something to critique, and I can't think of anything that needs improving... LIke Queen Marguerita Pizza this has become a staple when you feel like some good honest eats.   My only fear - the growth of the restaurant chain will mean they compromise their focus on quality...   However for now - a solid choice for a great burg"}
{"text":"Visited here during our vacation to Niagara Falls Canada and a worker from Ripleys moving theatre recommended this place. The food and service was awesome. I would definitely recommend this place. My husband and I really enjoyed it!!"}
{"text":"This was just okay. I've had way better. Nothing special."}
{"text":"Yes, the place is rammed and lined up. Because it's affordable, casual food in downtown Oakville, which is unheard of.  We were told we'd have a 20-25 minute wait, it only ended up being 15 at most. The food took a while to come- you just can't expect this place to be fast food- it's a restaurant. Order one of their great beer options (try the refreshing Mr.Huff pilsner) and chill out and enjoy the buzz. We both enjoyed our burgers- there's tons to choose from and they delivered. It was nice to have options for sides, I especially appreciated not paying more for sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"The food is always fresh and tasty here. Never long wait periods once you order. The service here is always good."}
{"text":"Tonight I had a takeout cheeseburger from this place and I was very disappointed.  For $11--which was just for the sandwich, no side--I was expecting one of the best burgers in the city.  Instead I got a greasy, fried hunk of food-court quality beef on an indifferent bun.  Furthermore, the kitchen couldn't even be bothered to directly apply to my takeout burger the ketchup I had ordered, opting instead to just add a large packet of Heinz in my takeout bag.  For $11, I expect the labour cost of condiment application for takeout orders to be included.  With all the excellent gourmet burger places that have opened in Toronto over the past few years (e.g. Big Smoke Burgers), I'm suprised that the wildly overpriced medocrity at The Works can attract repeat business.  On a positive note, the serving staff seems, from a limited takeout perspective, friendly and dedicated.  Too bad they aren't provided with better fare to serve."}
{"text":"I walked in thinking it was \"The Woks\", but it was the best mistake i ever made. This palce has amazing burgers and appetizers. The drinks are given in Pyrex glasses (like who thinks of these things?!) amazing idea and creative serving. I always get the Cash Burger, because it makes me 'make it rain'!"}
{"text":"The Works sounded like it woul be exciting when it opened but overall it's a little mundane.  The burgers are good but not great and the ambience is generally a little lacking - it's almost always full of loud people drinking cheap cocktails from pyrex measuring jugs.  The poutine is acceptable but not great (gravy is lacking in my opinion)."}
{"text":"Burgers were great! There was a lot of choices when it comes to toppings. Be prepared to read! I had the chocolate milkshake (was served in a pyrex measuring cup, very cool!), had traces of vanilla and malt in it. It was very tasty!  Wasn't a fan of the road house decor but the service was very good especially since all their tables were full.   They don't take reservations so be prepared to wait 30 minutes for a table....  I will be coming back soon."}
{"text":"The chefs must have been on vacation because everything was over cooked, and I had to send my burger back. I've seen Hockey pucks that are more tender.  Other locations have been very good, and I assumed that the quality was going to be the same here. The works was going for a hat trick, but after this, it's obvious they left the goal wide open. The staff barely knows how to play the game, they should all be placed in the penalty box.  1 Star, Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times in small groups, and I consistently leave satisfied with the food and the service. I don't know about some of the other reviews on here, but my servers always seem to be very much concerned about the quality of the food they've given us, making sure to ask if we're enjoying our food.   The food tastes amazing! My friend swore that her 'Gettin' Piggy With It' was the best burger she's ever had. I also love sharing their poutine with a friend (it's too big to eat on your own, trust me) and their onion rings are superb. For $16, you get a massive burger and a side. For $10, you get a massive bucket of poutine. Emphasis on MASSIVE. All serving sizes here are MASSIVE.  If you're having a day where you just want to endlessly stuff your face, I'd stop by here for sure. Just don't eat anything 24 hours before hand."}
{"text":"We went for a family lunch to this place on Sunday. We waited 10 min at the door to get seated. Then we were greeted by an extremely rude waitress who clearly did not want to be there. Whatever we asked her about the menu she'd respond by pointing to the menu and saying \"it's all listed there\".  Extremely helpful right? We ordered our food, which by the way is just burger and fries, nothing special. We ordered a few salads too. Ten minutes later some other waiter comes over and says \"hey guys we're out of lettuce\"!!! How they're seating and serving people is beyond me. So we ask for the bill and ten minutes after the rude waitress shows up and says \"I guess you should have ordered burgers\"! She brings the bill for the drinks,  it's like 15$ for the drinks and she asks if we want change!!! My jaw dropped. I'm a good tipper, normally 25% but honestly after that service it was amazing that she would ask for a tip. I would not recommend this place to anyone. It's really really bad."}
{"text":"Good but not great.  I knew The Works when it was an Ottawa only thing.  I'd say the burger has gone down in quality since my Ottawa days.  I found it a tad dry frankly.  The patty seems to be flat (thinner) hence less juicy.  Aside from the fact the burger was just okay everything else is great about this place; great staff, great atmosphere.  We also had the onion ring tower to share which was excellent.  This item comes with two dipping sauces.  I had the fries for my side.. totally decent. PS on a prior visit i had the chicken burger this was and remains an excellent item.  I know I'll go back but I'll be sure to request they go easy so as to not overcook the meat.  3.5 stars"}
{"text":"I take it from reading the other reviews that I just went in on a bad day. I ordered a spicy burger and fries which cost over $15. For that price it should have danced on my tongue, but it didn't. I got a decent sized portion of fries but the burger fell flat. The burger wasn't nearly spicy enough. I realize that people have different tolerances to heat but I've had baby food that offered more of a kick. On top of that, the 20 minute wait for my food gave me the hope that they may have been making the patty to order because it certainly wasn't busy (there were only two other tables and they were both eating already). The burger patty itself was small, under seasoned and bland. The only reason this place is getting one star from me is that the servers were professional and friendly. I may try it again because of all the positive reviews, but I am certainly not anticipating it."}
{"text":"This is my second time at this chain, first time at this location. Service was slow, we basically just sat ourselves down to a table when we came in as there were servers walking around but no one greeted us. Then it took awhile before a server came to our table to ask us what to drink. After that, it was ok, the server was more attentive to our table. I decided to try \"The Three Ring Binder\" - fried mushroom, chipotle mayo, gouda cheese and three onion rings. I asked for a whole wheat bun but they gave me a white bun, considering it took that long to get the food, I didn't even bother asking to change.  The burger was delicious, pattie was juicy and a bit spicy from the chipotle. It was a big burger, I was struggling to finish at the end. I got the die-cut chips on the side, it was alright, some were soggy but I prefer the crispy ones. It was a good meal but expensive for the food you are getting. Really, burger + chips came out to $18 (taxes + tip). Not good for my wallet."}
{"text":"Premium burger at a premium price not the best atmosphere bit of a yuppie place. Like having a burger in the garage not the most comfortable seating but good burgers for the price. They could lose the mason jars anytime soon"}
{"text":"Great place, Great service, Great topping choices. Milkshakes are awesome. Patty choices are pretty limited. Wish they can add Lamb Patty and Black Bean Patty. Washroom cleanliness can be improved.  I'll certainly go again."}
{"text":"Quite the selection of burgers. Had the Benny Piggenbeef. It was OK. Didn't really like the BBQ sauce and the bacon was very much on the thin side. Kind of like Maple Leaf Ready Crisp bacon that you stick in the microwave. Unfortunately, the poutine was underwhelming. I might be willing to go back and try another selection."}
{"text":"Place looked nice from the outside with a lot of ppl inside.. went with my toddler and wife to check out their poutine.  We end up ordering burgers as well and my wife told the waiter well done she's pregnant. .. when we receive the burgers my wife takes a bite and notices the burger is red inside ... we let the waiter know he offers to through the burger back on the grill lol.. seriously lol.. we send it back stating we don't want the burger and when I get the bill they charge us for the burger lol.. I ask the waiter what's going on he tells us his boss wouldn't let him take it off and actually says can you please speak with her he can't do nothing about he's already tried lol.. we then speak to the boss and she she tells my wife that's their well done ... bottom line didn't pay for the  burger wouldn't hold back.."}

{"text":"This place is okay. I got the Lucy but it tasted like any other standard burger out there except this one was $16. I personally don't think their burgers are worth the price.. Might as well go to Burger Priest. My friends got more adventerous looking burgers but they all stand mediocre in taste. Service was fantastic, but ultimately I probably would rather take my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Petit restaurant et bar sympathique avec des hors d'uvres frits et des hamburger de qualité (wapiti, dinde, boeuf) proposé avec une ribambelle d'options : avocat, ufs, jalapeño, sauces bbq, sauces mesquite  ... Tout est donc parfait sur papier, le problème c'est qu'ils furent rapidement dépassés par quelques pénuries en cuisine : manquait tel ou tel fromage, manquait l'avocat, n'avait plus de ceci ou de cela et très vite les commandes devenaient compliquer à gérer d'où un certain désordre et une inconstance dans le service. Le patron du restaurant a été très aimable en proposant de ne rien faire payer, une option qui était trop généreuse, nous avons préféré une réduction partielle sur l'une des deux commandes. Nous y retournerons car dans l'ensemble, ce restaurant mérite le détour."}
{"text":"The first time my SO and I tried The Works we fell in love instantly. The extensive menu, grunge-y decor, great music, atmosphere and quirky servers charmed us right away.   I've tried the \"Gettin' Piggy With It\" a few times and it has always been delicious. Peameal bacon, bacon strips, bacon ketchup... mmm bacon. Can't get enough. My other favourite is the \"War Pig\" with barbecue sauce, mushrooms, cheese, and again... bacon!  My SO's go-to is the \"Juicy Lucy\", which is a cheese stuffed burger with all your standard toppings, but of course, additional toppings are available for a small extra fee.   There are so many options for customization as well as quite a few different sides to choose from. One thing I especially love is that they use 100% Canadian beef and that they also offer patty replacements for those who don't want the standard beef. I believe the other options include a crispy chicken patty, elk & beef, a gourmet veggie burger and a portobello mushroom cap. Bun options are multigrain, white, gluten free and naked! Love all of the options.  Will always come back here!"}
{"text":"Love it! I love the decor. Just everything about their business layout, seriously. I'm pretty much in love with the concept, decor, and atmosphere. I like how they have local/national touches (ex. Crappy Tire) and satire humour. Prices are good and food is good. Although they need to improve on the freshness of their vegetables, my salad had that toad green and I could not finish it!"}
{"text":"We had high hopes for this place because of a recommendation.   A friend and I came for lunch and ordered off the lunch special menu without checking what else they had to offer. I got the burger with brisket and bbq sauce, and fries (Dead Ringer). It tasted ok. I thought it was neat that the drinks came in measuring cups.  When we asked for our bill, we saw that the waitress had charged us for dinner. When we asked her about it, she told us that we'd neglected to specify that we ordered off the lunch menu. Then she told us if we wanted to make a savings, we could just not tip her. We tipped her anyway... with that kind of attitude we probably should have taken her up on her offer.  In short food 3/5, service 2/5. I've had much better $15 burgers elsewhere in Toronto, hence the 2 stars."}
{"text":"So I finally had the chance to get some lunch at The Works. I drive home past this new location in Oakville everyday and almost always the place has been just packed! Before going I read up on the reviews to get an idea what to get or avoid. The biggest concerns about the place seemed to be cost, line ups & service.     Line ups are a sign a place is good and although this place could be worthy of this type of line up I think it was more the result of the service. The reviews about the service were bang on. We arrived at noon sharp and they had a full staff. They were very friendly but there was an odd wait after our drink order that had people asking if they should find a server?     Then some of the drinks came in the wrong size, which requires another mention. The small sized milk shake is very small almost pointless really. I think most children would protest its size!     Then as we waited for our food to be prepared we watched as small line ups would form with empty seats in the restaurant? It seemed that they had problems with the flow at the front of house. The staff weren't talking amongst themselves or doing other things. They just didn't pick up on the usually obvious signs that a table was ready to order or needed something.      The prices weren't to bad but are top tier and do add up very quickly. This isn't 5 guys but it isn't the Keg either. So as a treat it could be fine or if hanging out in the area but it isn't a regular burger stop for this price point. Though the location and layout would make it a great place in the summer for a meal were you want to take your time and hang out a bit. A warning though if you're trying to fit in a trip to the works on your lunch hour you may get in trouble for taking an extra long lunch break.     The burger was excellent and worth the money. The fries were upgraded to the poutine and though good I really feel they would have been better left as just fresh cut fries and the savings would have made the price a fair one. The milk shake was very good but again the price when added to the incredibly small size makes it a no go for value or feeling satisfied.     Being a new location they have things to work out and hopefully they will in a reasonable amount of time but there is work that needs to be done if they are to really have a long term future.     After reviewing this for a few friends I was giving the big question, will you go back? The answer is yes but not in the near future while there are a number of other locations I have yet to try and this just wasn't \"that special\". Though with improvements and a nice summer day it could be!"}
{"text":"Originally had The Works when I lived in Ottawa so I was so excited when they opened one in Pickering. Unfortunately the quality was just not the same but I am willing to give it one more shot."}
{"text":"2 check-in's too many.  I don't remember the name of my burger the first time around, but I do remember it had eggplant and pesto in it. The flavour was superb and it is something I would eat again, though ... Without the burger meat. Just like the first time, my second time around the burger meat was really dry and bland.  I don't really know what The Works is considered but I assume gourmet burger place?   First time I came here, I was so-so about it, so I thought to myself, \"Okay, I'll give it a second chance.\" There will be no third.  The Works is a really big disappointment to me and it's extremely bittersweet because they do have some flavour combinations that really do work and are spot on, but the proteins, I don't know how they manage to screw it up all the time. I've never come alone here and even my other table mates have said the burger is just dry but they enjoy the flavour.  Really unique place though, down to their serving glasses in measuring cups to the extensive menu with a staff member up and ready to walk you through it as it really can be overwhelming. But whoever said a little customization isn't a good thing right? That is something I do commend them on.  There's nothing I want more than this place to succeed, but until they can get their cooking times right on their proteins, I don't see myself coming here in the near future. Maybe if they're still in business 2 or 3 years down the road, I might consider returning and updating my review."}
{"text":"I've eaten from more than one location and they're all the same taste wise. Unfortunately, that's not really a good thing. There's a lot of variety but none Ive tasted (10+) are very good. Some are actually repulsive. Ever since I moved from the area, I've never been enticed into eating at any location ever again."}
{"text":"No problems here, only good.  There were over 50 choices of burgers, and even our friendly waitress said you can mix and match the items to create the burger you want.  Some of the choices were very creative!  I had a poutine burger and loved it!  It was a fun place, I would imagine for any age.  We loved the silly decor and classic rock in the background.  Prices were reasonable.  We're coming back!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times now and I'm just not sure.  It's expensive.    When my wife orders the milkshake, all of a sudden I'm John Travolta and she's Uma Thurman.   A five dollar shake?   \"I don't know if that shake's worth five dollars but it's pretty damn good.\"  Is the food good?  Well it's good... I don't think it is great.  And with burgers at the $14 mark and poutine (arguably in a bucket) for $9 the bill adds up quick.  Had the butter chicken poutine.  I've discovered that only butter chicken tastes good.  Butter chicken anything else is a good idea, but never really works out.  Tried to have a meeting there one time - and the noise level from the Classic Rock soundtrack is just a little on the loud side for an effective conversation.  The menu designer should be fired.  Black text on brown paper.  And lots of little symbols that suggest you should look to the bottom * - even though the symbols you look up are kind of useless \"New item, Works Original item.  And the witty comments in the menu are about as funny and entertaining as my review.  Plus the massive menu is basically a collection of permutations and combinations of toppings. Just tell me the toppings, I'm an adult and can put it together."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying that my boyfriend and I have been to The Works at their Danforth location many times, and needless to say, we adore the place. Hearing that there was a place closer to us in Pickering, we dragged my parents along to finally try what we considered to be the perfected (and creative) burger, and were profoundly disappointed.  First off, nearly everything we ordered was overdone. 3 of us ordered Elk burgers (which take 20 minutes longer than beef to be prepared, and cost $4 extra), all of which were left on the grill too long. The fries, even the /fries/ were overcooked, rendering them completely inedible. The only mildly redeeming part about the meal was the $10 tower of onion rings we ordered as an appetizer which we weren't served plates for.  Apart from the food, the service was severely lacking; Our waitress was cheery enough, but was pretty incompetent the entire night. Ordering was kind of a hassle. At the end of the meal, my boyfriend jokingly asked for his water to be \"wrapped up to go.\" She reached for it before everyone looked at her, and she caught on. Long night.  Sadly, this place did not even come close to the service or quality its name provides in the city. Avoid this location at all costs; it's worth the extra gasoline."}
{"text":"My favourite burger place, I would recommend the blues burger. The blue cheese is amazing. Prices are pretty fair as well. Always a good experience the only negative I would say is that they don't have a very many choices for an appetizer before your burger."}
{"text":"Okay food, for high prices. Service is good but hard to get Wait time for takeout and get to getting someone to serve you needs to be improved."}
{"text":"I came here yesterday for their birthday to get one of their signature burgers for only $5.15! It was the busiest I had ever seen it, but we managed to snag the last table upon arrival. Who could resist their burgers at this price? I decided I would finally try the Elk on a Beech burger since it is the most expensive option on the menu. It was pretty good, but I did not find it was exceptionally better than some of their other creations I have tried. I do love it's uniqueness because where else do you find an Elk burger? Based on the price though I wouldn't get it again. I still can't get over how good their onion rings are, my favourite! Haven't found any that are better yet.  Don't forget to join their WIP loyalty program because it is so worth it! They give you $15 on your birthday if you use the card at least once before it occurs and $10 for every 150 points. I know a lot of people say it's pricey and it is, but at least this program helps to recover some of the costs. For example, I managed to get 150 points on my card and then my birthday passed so I had $25 available to spend. I used my card to pay for my meal (which was already discounted thanks to their birthday special) that was less than $10 with tip so essentially I dined for free. Also fill out their online survey with your receipt to receive $5 off on your next visit when you spend $20 or more. See tons of ways to save some money and enjoy a great burger!  I also want to mention that the service we received from Nick was excellent. Really cool guy and a great server! Also as another review mentioned, if you sit by the garage door, it is pretty cold! I hope they can fix this problem for next winter. On the other hand I look forward to enjoying this feature in the summer!"}
{"text":"Elk burger was good. Bit overpriced though under normal pricing. Service was hectic today because of anniversary."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service. I will definitely be going back!  The atmosphere is nice and comfortable and the music is great. Everything is served in a fun and fresh way which is a refreshing change from most restaurants.   I'm allergic to preservatives, hormones and antibiotics that are in meat so eating out is a challenge for me. This place is amazing because you can taste the freshness and I can eat everything on the menu!  Very filling and delicious for a great price.   Some people have complained about raw burgers but friends and I have gone numerous times and this has never happened. Must be a very rare occasion and an easy fix to put back on the grill. The servers are always very friendly and check to make sure everything is good a few times, which I really liked!   Overall I highly recommend this place !  Yummy!!"}
{"text":"I visited The Works in Oakville twice now and spoke with the owners and the staff and assure you that if you that this is a very customer focused business and if have any concerns or questions, they will be excited...yes, excited to help you.  But, I mean that is probably the best way to go when you have a major issue is address it and not hide from it.  But that's just me.  Anyway...the truth about The Works in one sentence.  A seriously customer focused business, serving great burgers, amazing milkshakes and outstanding poutine in the perfect space.    More details from my blog text:  Oh yes, another burger joint review.  Oh yes, this review has details about burgers.  And oh yes, it is not your average burger joint.  After visiting The Works in Oakville I wasn't sure if I wanted to come back and eat or come back and invest in a franchise.  Everything The Works does has the customer in mind which to me is a recipe for success.  See that play on words?  Did you see it?    To me when it comes to burgers, there are 3 categories:  The Greasy Spoon Wonder - Think Johnny's & Burger Priest, the \"Quality\" burger - think Craft Burger and Stockyards and the \"WTF\" burger - Think Nota Bene Wagyu Beef Brisket Burger or Susur Lee's Cheese Burger Spring Rolls...yeah, that just happened.  The Works falls in the second category of the \"Quality\" burger and does it 68 ways.  That's not a typo, you can have your burger over 68 ways.  Technically, you can have it 408 ways as the 68 topping combos are available on Pure Ground Beef, Whole Chicken Breast, Ground Turkey, Veggie Burger Portobello Mushroom Cap and Domestic Elk for $3.29 upgrade.  I shared a R.O.F. chicken breast, All The Hits Portebello and of course a plain cheeseburger to taste the meat.  Though the beef is between lean and extra lean, they care for the cooking and a simple squeeze of the meat exposes the tasty juices.  Wonderful.  I can tell you that this restaurant is definitely worth the visit in one sentence.  A seriously customer focused business, serving great burgers, bomb azz milkshakes and outstanding poutine in the perfect space.  Everything else to me is nothing more then details.  Now I could go on for days about the lengths the owners have gone to respect the community, build a special work environment, create special food and manage their daily customer line-ups but in all honesty, the owners would tell you themselves.  Go there, order and burger and a milkshake and ask to meet the owners and chat with them.     The Works is an Ottawa native, purchased from its original owner with 11 locations, line-ups at each location and very, very big plans. The Oakville location houses roughly 75 seats, the decor alone is worth the trip being dotted with Oakville and owner memorabilia.  I really enjoyed the space.  Did I mention that all drinks are served in these Pyrex glasses.  The current owners wanted to keep as much of the founding owners concepts and details as possible out of respect for their hard work building this business and because it works."}
{"text":"Do not order take away from this location. I've given it a chance time and time again but now I'm done.   Today when I ordered the Love Goat burger it was made with anything but love. First of all I ordered a vegetarian party and they still put bacon on it. I should think the waiter clarify if I'm ordering a veg party on a burger that usually has bacon that I don't want the bacon. Second, the goat cheese sat on in the middle of the paddy like the ratio of a donut and a donut hole. They forgot the sweet and spicy sauce altogether so really this burger was absolutely not gourmet and not worth $16.   I also suspect the fries were made yesterday because they were chewy. I know what fresh fries taste like and they are not chewy.  To top off the whole experience, the waiter wouldn't take my $50 on a $34 order  because he didn't have change. I reluctantly paid by debit and even tipped 15% on a take out order because I felt bad for the waiter who complained the boss never provides enough change for the til. But after I got home and my order was so terrible it just made me feel that much more ripped off."}
{"text":"Took my fiancé for his birthday dinner here. Can't wait to come back in the spring! The burgers were scrumptious. He got am elk burger and I got one with Brie and the gluten free bun. Oh, and don't forget the poutine. Had a couple drinks and it was around 70$, which is what I was hoping for. Beers on tap are good and they have a good wine selection for a burger joint. I'd like to make a goal to try all the burgers on the menu but I'm trying not to be over zealous."}
{"text":"Great service and clever menu! Tons of unique burger choices and is vegetarian and gluten free friendly. I'll be back !"}
{"text":"Came here with Thursday night with my girls randomly. Never heard of it before but my girl told me it was a chain she checked out in Barrie. It was a laid back atmosphere with unique touches. The shakers were light bulbs and they gave you drinks in a measuring cup. Our waitress was really nice and very attentive. They didn't have the big mushroom caps for my friends burger so they gave her two small ones didn't charge her, which was really nice. They have different options for the type of bread, patty, and side. I got the Kamikaze burger with kraft dinner on the side. It had jalapeños and cheese and banana peppers on top. They gave me Chipotle mayo on the side for free.  They said they wouldn't put the hot sauce in my burger, just on the side but they still put it on my burger which killed the taste for me. I love hot sauce but this was kind of a smoky bbq type hot sauce which I'm not a fan of. The burger wasn't too bad but not life changing either. The gluten bun started falling apart so I just ate the meat. I ordered the kids size milkshake which was ok but very sweet. Maybe a syrup they use?  Overall it was a decent experience and I wouldn't mind coming back. Great service for sure. 3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Oh yah - I hate the menu.  Really hate these places which name their burgers / sides / toppings completely stupid names.  It takes you at least 15 mins to read the 1-pager that is confusing, wordy with ridiculous names that has NOTHING TO DO WITH FOOD.    At the end of reading the menu, I was annoyed and just wanted a basic burger.  Then the burger came and it was not good at all!  Disappointed with the quality of my burger & husband feels the same.  Meat was very dry.  We also had the torpedo onion rings or whatever it was called.  Save your money.  It's OKAY but nothing to come back for, especially for the price (can't recall exact price, but it was probably $9+ for basic, greasy onion rings).  Bill came to close to $50 for 2 people."}
{"text":"Ok food but nothing great. I knew the menu was going to be confusing when our server had to give us a \"tutorial\". Over priced everything for such a casual burger joint. Probably wouldn't return again."}
{"text":"This place was awesome. I had a delicious bacon burger. What really set this place apart from other places was their attention to my girlfriends gluten allergy. The waitress was conscious of it when placing our order and made sure her order did not contain any gluten. I would highly recommend this establishment to anyone."}
{"text":"For a place that specializes in burgers, I was disappointed with the quality of the burgers. I ordered a simple burger, medium (cooked), and when it arrived the burger was completely dried, most likely cooked from frozen on the grill without thawing first. It was honestly worse than going to McDonald's. Never again."}
{"text":"My finance and I are seasoned works burger customer.  We usually visit the Oakville location but we were in the city so we decided to visit this location. We were seated right away and our drink orders were taken right away which was great. Our waitress was very pleasant. I'm pregnant and starving all the time but we decided to bypass the starter and just order our burgers. When the waitress brought our drinks she spilt my fiancés beer which was fine, mistakes happen but then she just walked away. We had to grab napkins from another table, which is not the end of the world but it probably should of been handled in a different way. Anyway to keep a long story short we waited 50 MINUTES for our burgers. Which were cold by that time. Our waitress apologized, it wasn't her fault so I don't blame her.  The Canadian bacon on my burger didn't even look like Canadian bacon and it was missing the beachhouse sauce which is my main reason for loving the works. Our waitress was wonderful and was very apologetic and gave us a voucher for a free burger. My recommendation would be to visit a different works burger if you are craving a burger."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, I love The Works but this location is just a disappointment. While the food is delicious like every other Works restaurant, the service here is subpar at best.   I went to this location today with my boyfriend for lunch and the waitresses were inattentive and forgetful. Little things like not having our water refilled, not getting barbecue sauce we ask for, and waiting over 15 minutes for our receipt really dampened our experience.   We love the burgers here but will most likely be going to the downtown Toronto location from now on."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service!  From the second we walked in we were given great service from both the host and our server.   I loved the amount of options given on both burgers and milkshakes, and how numerous things on the menu are gluten free (my sister has a gluten intolerance, it is rare to find many options in restaurants for her other than salad). I got the sexy burger on a multi grain bun with 'bold slaw' and I was pleasantly surprised not only by the freshness but also the combination of burger toppings I had never thought of. I also got a \"shake odyssey\", which was a milkshake that has peanut butter, caramel, and Oreos, topped off with whip cream. It was delicious!  Great atmosphere, great food, like no restaurant I've been to in the Pickering area, Will most definitely be back. Very highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant. At least the works in general is. I love the food and this place has the best onion rings in town, alongside the 2nd best sweet potato fries. The burgers are always delicious and consistent. I love this place.   The only issue I have is usually the servers never seem super happy. Not a lot of smiles when I go. Not sure why, you get to work around delicious burgers all the time. Nonetheless though, the aesthetician, food and quick service time always keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"Great burgers Excellent onion rings Terrific shakes.  Need I say more.  It's a burger joint. Good eats / good service."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to The Works for lunch on a Sunday. We were the first people in the restaurant that morning, so the hostess said we could choose where ever we wanted to. We got a nice table by the window over looking downtown Oakville.   Our server was attentive and took our drink orders right away. It was my husband's first time at The Works, so he asked for recommendations. Not only did the server tell us what burgers were his favourite, but also which bun he usually chooses and what side is his go-to. As per the servers recommendation, by husband had The Hangover with french fries. I got First Date with onion rings. Both of us loved our burgers. They were big, they were messy and they were totally worth it.   We skipped the milkshakes and dessert menu even though they looked amazing.   The bill came to just over $40 for our meal. While I feel it is really pricey for lunch, the burgers are big, delicious and stuffed full of goodness. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious. That's all there is to say! Why only 4/5? They over salted their fries by a long shot - and I like my salt. When I mentioned it to the waitress, she noted that it's how they do it. You can't take salt off, so my recommendation would be to ask for them to not salt at all, and do it yourself at table."}
{"text":"I'll start with the good part. The food was excellent and the staff was friendly and welcoming. Unfortunately there wasn't enough staff to handle a Saturday evening crowd. I'm assuming the kitchen had the same lack of staff problem. After being seated and placing our order, the meal took 38 minutes to arrive.   Once we had finished, it took another 16 minutes to get our servers attention to pay the bill. The bill is another thing, it's little expensive for a hamburger and fries."}
{"text":"This is my first visit to the Works and i must say, i was a bit surprised by the choices they offer.  Some were very creative.  After perusing the menu for about 10 minutes and enjoying a beverage while trying to figure out what i wanted to eat, i noticed they also had different selections of meat to choose from.  I finally decided on the Teriyaki melt with Coleslaw and ask for the patty to be Elk.  I asked that they not put any mushrooms on my burger and substitute caramelized onions instead.   With Elk being such  a lean meat and i like wild game and its been  a while since i had elk so the test is to see if they over cook a lean meat like this.  I'm experienced and ready to pass judgment.  It takes a while for the food to come but i had a pleasant waitress named Jaden and games on my phone to keep me occupied until my meal arrived.  Still enjoying that beverage i mentioned at the beginning by the way.  So my meal arrives and i decided to try the coleslaw first.  Now that was not what i expected but it was the kind of good surprise for a change.  They use some type of pepper mayo in the slaw, and if i heard her right it has a bit of Jalapeno in it.  That slaw had some kick but it was good.  I can honestly say i have never had anything like it before and found it quite creative and appealing for those who like a bit of spice.  Next the burger.  I love Teriyaki and i love elk so if they did it wrong it will be a disaster.  Fortunately for me, they did it right.  The burger was juicy and the Teriyaki seemed to soak right in and keep it moist like it should be.  Elk is  a difficult protein to cook and some people can turn it into shoe leather real quick so the cook was on his game tonight.  Now it was a bit pricey for a burger but if you do it right it will be worth every penny.   Also i like the restaurant itself.  It looked like they could open up the garage door sized windows in the summer which i think i s cool, and the place is clean and modern and trendy.  Once you get past choice overload, its all good.  I will be back again soon, i think next time we will try a turkey burger and see if they can keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers!!! Awesome topping combinations, with funny names! Fries were YUMMY! Can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Josh is the best waiter the world has ever known. His personal brand of optimism is the universe's newest art form.  Beer commercials should feature Josh. If you are lucky enough to sit at a table he is working, you are lucky enough. When Josh makes a suggestion dictators take his advice. It is difficult not to feel jealous when Josh is serving other patrons. Often people name their children after Josh after having him as their waiter just one time. The burger tastes better because Josh took your order and brought the burger to your table."}
{"text":"It's National Burger Day today, seriously.  So we are celebrating in style.  Ordered juicy lucy and a poutini martini and a root beer float.  Go hard or go home.  The poutini martini was soooo good.  Crispy onion rings on top of poutine.  So addictive!! Burger was good although a bit dry and I see it's a common experience based on other Yelp reviews.  The root beer float was great.  Service was friendly and the place was busy at 9pm.  The challenge is the kitchen is really slow so be prepared to wait for your food.  Next time I have a craving I'm coming back for more poutine!!"}
{"text":"We ordered the Poutine on our way out of Toronto.   It was good and service was great!"}
{"text":"This is  a great place for burgers, and with 71 different burgers and extra choices like Portabello, Elk, Chicken, as substitute for the beef...you have plenty of choices They have home cut fries, poutine and salads.  Our waitress was nice and polite and did the usual rituals you would expect - drinks, utensils and extra napkins. We ordered ASAP, and our order arrive in a good time. We sat beside the opened windows, it was a warm sunny afternoon and was a great position for people watching.   This may sound like a long time for this review, but it has stuck in my mind. The week before Canada Day, they had a non-menu special  - a Poutine Burger - Fries, Mozzarella cheese curds and a thick (not runny) beef sauce.  I also ordered fries and a Caesar salad. Everything arrived hot...yes I did order the salad, but it had fresh cook bacon on tip. there was enough dressing and it complemented the vegetables. The burger was cooked well, and the burger was warm through-out the meal.  They offer a few items as a dessert and offer milk shakes and floats, Go online to www.worksburger.com for all of  your choices...some may seem like weird choices, but they are available. Do not knock it until you try it..."}
{"text":"I find the works is good but nothing special, I've been here a couple of times and their burgers are good but it won't amaze you. Tonight I wasn't too hungry so I ordered a poutine and who the heck knew..portion size was so big! The poutine had the right amount of gravy and cheese curds. I definitely couldn't finish everything so I had to bring it home."}
{"text":"I've been hearing about The Works for a while now and have wanted to try it out. Finally had the opportunity and took it. Food was excellent but be prepared for a high end  burgers ($$). Definitely worth the wait (literally and figuratively)."}
{"text":"Great burgers as always. Lots of variety. The space is really nice. They need to flesh out their service at this location though. It was very slow and rather rude, like they were doing you a favor. When brought it to their attention, they recognized their mistakes and gave us some free food. It will become a Beach staple in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"My favourite gourmet burger joint. I've been to about 4 locations and all were the same. The atmosphere is very industrial and unique and there's a decent amount of seating available. There's always so many different combinations to choose from and you can choose what kind of patty you'd like too. There's even several vegetarian options available! Everything they have available are things that I would want to eat if I was in the mood for a burger and not to healthy foods xp we all get that here and there. Portions are big too. I have never finished my meal. I struggle. Lol but in a good satisfying way :) I wish they had more locations I Toronto."}
{"text":"I'm really into gourmet burgers and this place hit the spot.  I went a bit different and I tried the Elk burger w/ Sweet Potato Fries.  The burger it self came out really good.  It was very flavorful and lean, good seasoning, and the toppings were great.  This place has pre-defined choices that you pick from which indicate which toppings go onto your burger.  For example, I got the Man Cave (Monetary jack cheese, Caramelized onions, Bacon, and BBQ sauce.)  It went very well with the Elk.  The Sweet Potato Fries were not that great to be honest.  I would say they were a tad bit dry lacking seasoning.  But hey, maybe it's a preference thing.  You might like them.  Service was great.  Our waiter was really nice and a chill dude easy to get along with.    I would suggest this place for the burger alone!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try The Works for a while now, & got a chance to go there when we were visiting friends who live about 15 minutes away from one.  We went to The Works Oakville location, & we arrived early enough that we didn't even have to wait in line, which is pretty good, considering that there were four adults & three kids.  Usually with seven people, you have to at least wait for them to pull a couple of tables together.  Our waiter was pleasant & warned us that the burgers would be about 20 minutes, so we decided to order the kids' meals & an appetizer while we waited.  For the uninitiated, ordering can take a while, because there are a LOT of choices when it comes to burgers (about 70, I think).  Anyway, the kids' meals & appetizer came out in decent time, & while the Big Dipper is basically just homemade, sliced potato chips, which are served at lots of restaurants, the fire-roasted cheese dip that came with it was outstanding & really set it apart from other places.  Between the adults, we killed off the Big Dipper in no time, & there was still some of the cheese dip left over for me to dip my fries in, so you know they're not stingy with the condiments, like some places.  Our burgers came out shortly after, so the 20-minute wait time proved fairly accurate.  I ordered the Smokey Mountain, which comes with barbecue sauce, jack cheese & bacon strips.  The burger itself was good, but didn't seem to stand out to me.  The Southwestern Peppercorn burger I had at Lone Star the other day seemed to have the same \"wow factor\" as this Works burger.  The fries were quite good, & there were a lot of them.  Rather than a handful of fries, you got a full basket of fries with your burger.  The fries are fresh-cut with the skin left on, & are reminiscent of Swiss Chalet's fries, except hotter.  And that leftover fire-roasted cheese dip was awesome with them.  When your food comes out, it comes in a rectangular baking pan, which is a neat touch.  Likewise, rather than glasses, your drinks come in measuring cups, which is also different.  Some people are saying that The Works is overpriced, which I don't find is the case.  There's not a burger on their extensive menu that cracks the $14 mark (unless you choose add-ons or extras).  Most family chain restaurants like Eastside Mario's, Kelsey's, Jack Astor's, Lone Star, etc. price their burgers $11 - $14 in range, which is the exact same as The Works.  Factor in the larger portions of fries, & it's actually a better deal at The Works.  The one problem I did have with The Works is that they boast six different types of \"gourmet patties\" (beef, chicken breast, ground turkey, veggie, portobello mushroom cap & domestic elk).  But nowhere on the menu does is say what size the patty is (I'm guesstimating about six ounces).  Nor do they offer you size options.  Most places that specialize in burgers will offer you either a four or six ounce patty, & a bigger, eight ounce patty.  You should at least have an option.  Not that I was hungry afterwards, I was absolutely stuffed, but you should have a choice of patty sizes.  The bottom line is that while The Works might not have \"wowed\" me, I do feel it was good food at a decent price, & I'd go back the next time I'm near one."}
{"text":"Went today Thanksgiving  they were open. Server greeted me right away. I wanted takeout. 1st time here ordered basic cheeseburger  and bacon cheeseburger  +deep fried dill pickels. Took about 15 minutes burgers was good juicy but the deep fried pickles were the best I've had. Friendly service Street parking but I had to oark illegally on Beresford.  There is Green P across the street.  Many specialty burgers I'll go back and try."}
{"text":"Oh my god snake oil I'm sick of smooth talking servers building up The capabilities of less than ordinary cooks over an hour for the greasy flavorless burger topped with so little of the toppings I payed for covered in a light cheese I seriously had to dissect  the burger to see if there were any toppings . One single napkin no forks were given for the poutine as if I enjoy putting my fingers in my mouth and constantly wiping them on that same dirty napkin. The only point to mention was the server was polite and courteous . Never again terrible small over priced burger"}
{"text":"I started going to The Works when I lived in Ottawa, where the chain got its start. It's quirky, fun, and the old fashioned, roughneck-like atmosphere is fun! They play classic rock in the background, serve drinks in measuring cups, and have incredible burgers! Although some of my friends say their burger quality has diminished over the years, I still think they're amazing. They get their burgers to be so good because they get their own ground beef and make their patties from scratch.  Definitely go here for a fun experience, a delicious burger, and a great time!"}
{"text":"If you know what you want it is a decent burger.  The Tower of Rings with beach sauce is great but if you bring your receipt from your previous trip then they are free.  If not $9.99 is a bit steep for a stack of rings."}
{"text":"The burgers are really good. Lots of choice of toppings, both conventional and non. But . BUT. Their service, was a little lacking, messed up my order - but did a good job rectifying and can't complain too much. Kudos for doing something about it, but I don't think we'll be going to this location again.   We came for burger week $5 of their choice of burger, and what was really good was the substantial portion. They also gave us the option of choosing our patty and bun as per the regular menu options. They  have ELK available for an extra $3.50 and given the deal on the burger I figured I would try that and a GLUTEN FREE BUN ($1).   We also ordered an appetizer platter (about $12) where you can choose 4 different sides like fries, sweet potato fries, onion rings, cucumbers with 4 different dipping sauces. It was perfect to share, but the 3 of us couldn't even finish it all.   When the burgers arrived, something landed in front of me, but then whoever delivered it was like, \"opps that's the beef\" and switched it with my co worker.  I'm eating it and wondering if I got ripped off because this Elk doesn't taste any different. Also this is the best gluten free bun I've ever tasted.  My co-worker meanwhile was complaining about his burger bun and how the texture is weird. I asked him what his burger tasted like, and he said different. By this point he was basically done his burger, and I was half way through.   Called over the manager and told him my suspicion. He made the server come apologize to us, and I said that I would like NOT to pay for the Elk and GF bun I never got, not to mention that my coworker shouldn't have to pay for it either.   When our bill finally came (yay for separate bills), the additional charges were still there. I blatantly said , i'm not paying for this, and gave it back to her. She fixed it, but the GF bun was still there. When she came back the 2nd time, she gave us coupons to use for a free burger for all of us. Too bad we have to come back to this location.   They handled this well, but a little sloppy in the service and management. Ultimately, we were satisfied, but doesn't leave a good first impression.   Their burgers are really good. I think they will do well in this area, just need to step it up with the service."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here tonight for a late dinner. The waitress asked what beer we wanted when she greeted us. I thought that was a little pushy. When we ordered our burgers she tried getting us to get gravy too. My boyfriend said \"they really try to up-sell you here.\"  Burgers were great. Bacon is thick and crispy. I had sweet potato fries. The sauce that came with the fries was amazing! Drinks come in liquid measuring glasses. I found that weird.  I would return. I love the wide selection. There are gluten-free buns for those wondering. 2 burgers, fries & sweet potato fries came to $37 with tax."}
{"text":"So many choices!  They have so many options for toppings it took forever to decide. But I settled on the Piggy.  Canadian bacon, crispy onions and cheddar cheese on a sesame bun. Messy and delicious!"}
{"text":"The Works Gourmet Burger Bistro is a chain that opened shop in the Bloor West Village sometime in November.   The menu is very extensive, some might say overwhelming. After a few minutes I decide on the BT Breakfast Burger which comes with real mayo, fried egg, ripe red tomato, cheddar cheese & crisp bacon strips ($13.95) which is accompanied with a side order of fries and I add a ginger ale (bottomless for $2.91) to wash it down.  The drink came in a measuring cup which was kind of odd and the burger and fries were served in a baking pan. The burger was a decent size  and it was good but not great, they use fresh Canadian beef and it's cooked medium well. I had asked if I could get it medium but they said they cannot do less than medium well, as result the burger was little bit dry but the seasoning was fine. One thing that surprised me was the quality of the fries. The fries are fresh cut and lightly seasoned and crispy but not too crispy, I find fries in most burger places to be too soggy or too crispy.  Overall, it's a good burger that's a decent size with really good fries. The servers are attentive, informative and friendly. It was pretty busy on a Saturday around the lunch hour."}
{"text":"A solid \"meh.\"  The burgers are overcooked and not particularly flavorful. Adding bacon, chili, or Fritos doesn't really change that.  Given the price tag I'd say it's not really worth it"}
{"text":"Can I give less than 1 star?  This place is garbage. One of the worst dining experiences of my life. I don't want to bore you all with the story, but the bottom line is the service is horrible and management is indifferent. The food is extremely over-rated and certainly not worth the obscene prices. You shouldn't have to hide a good burger with lots and lots of toppings. I can see why the Works does this; they do not serve a good burger. Off the top of my head, I can rattle off 10 local places where you can get a better burger. God knows you get better service during a prostate exam. This place is terrible, and I hope it goes away soon. Save your money."}
{"text":"Service is impeccable always.  The burgers are really excellent, except once when I ordered the Jamaican Jerk burger and didn't get a tomato, even though it says a tomato comes on it on the menu. But hey it's just one tomato I'll live.  The poutine is delicious as well.  The only problem I have with this place is that the lights are extremely harsh, no matter where we're seated there is always a harsh light pointing directly into my face.  My advice is for the works crew to sit in every seat, and turn any lights that are pointing directly at the customer. This criticism might sound stupid but I actually know a few people who think the same thing! Other than the tomato and the lights my experience here is always near perfect! All the staff are lovely."}
{"text":"I joined friends here for dinner, and have no desire to go back. I ordered a \"premium vegetarian burger\"...it was just ok. For $16 + tax/tip... I would hope for better. The fries were decent. My husbands burger was over cooked. Wait staff was pleasant but my drink was empty for quite a while because being offered water. Meh. Not recommended."}
{"text":"Service très lent mais burgers extra! Je m'attendais à une qualité plutôt médiocre par rapport à l'emplacement (très très touristique)mais pas du tout! La viande est bonne les portions généreuses et le staff très sympathique! Les boissons sont servies dans un verre doseur, original à souhait!"}
{"text":"Tower of onion rings were delicious. Never disappointed here. Miss the Reese's Pieces Burger. Huge poutines. Awesome music in the place and good atmosphere"}
{"text":"The burger selection is amazing. And the burgers are pretty good.  I think Burgers Priest is better but this place has a lot more going on. The beer selection is good.  Love the Barking Squirrel  beer.  Staff were all really friendly and the food overall was good.  Service was excellent.    I will be back."}
{"text":"Started out with the 'Wrecking Balls' appetizer, Bacon-wrapped cheddar tater tots served with bacon and roasted garlic aioli.  Very good, lots of calories... LOL.  I then ordered the Kamikaze burger and added a fried egg, hash brown, onion ring, kraft dinner, fried onions, bacon and more.  It was huge and awesome!  8 oz. burger.  Great selection of burger options, buns, proteins, etc.  Also a number of sides to choose from.  I had the fresh cut fries which were excellent, my wife had the spicy die-cut chips, also very good.  If I had to fix anything, the burger was slightly overdone, so next time I'll ask them to cook it to medium.  Overall a great experience.  Nice atmosphere, friendly customer service, great burger!"}
{"text":"Love the options and the ability to customize the burger bun, patty, etc. Fries are great and unlimited if you have room. Juicy well prepared burgers, fast service without hovering or rushing you. The onion rings are a must do! The pitchers of beer aren't a bad thing either. A nice casual addition to the area. I'll be back and often,"}
{"text":"This is one of those places I felt I had to try a few times in order to write a review.  With so many choices and options, it seemed unfair to assign a rating with only one visit.  I've been now about three times and I'm a fan.    The meat itself isn't a five-star patty, but it is juicy and tasty and obviously, it's the toppings and sides that really make the visit.  I like the bun they use (thick and a bit crusty).  My fave burger is the Tom Green - gouda, bacon, avocado slices and beech house sauce.  God, it's delicious.  I had previously tried the Nacho Libre, which I didn't think was anything amazing.  My husband always gets the ring of fire (an onion ring on top of the burger and filled with hotter than hell sauce), and he loves it.  Caution, it's ridiculously spicy.    The onion rings are fantastic (I love breaded rings) and the choice of dips is fantastic.  I enjoy the beech house (like, what is IN that??? so good), the bacon/garlic aioli, the chipotle dip, sweet and spicy, ok ok, i like them all.    Fries are really too salty, I don't even think I will order them again.  Doesn't matter though b/c the onion rings are all I need.  One last complaint is that in the winter, this place is FREEZING b/c of the garage door-windows that line the restaurant.  Bring a big scarf."}
{"text":"We had a turkey and beef burgers with slaw and broccoli. Both great. My pineapple shake was wonderful. BS and cake for dessert were perfect size. Had constant refills of water which is always nice. Luke was a great server all the staff was great! Well work a visit."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I had a great experience.  The beef burgers were excellent!  Just one suggestion, make the gravy in the poutine less like Kentucky Fried Chicken and more home style!"}
{"text":"My first time here, I picked up a bug probably from ice in ginger ale. I ended up seeing my doctor after agonizing stomach cramps. I always drink from bottle and never try ice as there are so many bugs and bacteria in ice. I think the sandwich was ok.  I was very unfortunate."}
{"text":"Be prepared to pay \"your arm and one leg\" for a burger that wouldn't rate in the top 50 burgers you have ever eaten.  Onion rings were terrible.  Don't order an egg on the burger it is frozen pre made."}
{"text":"I had a total burger craving tonight and this place delivered.   I actually opted for their \"Son of a Beech\" - veggie patty (probably the best I've tasted). Feta, sundried tomato, avocado and their beech sauce (super garlic mayo).   The husband had the \"Three Ring Binder\"...3 onion rings on that puppy!  Chipotle mayo was a good touch.   I love fries, but today I tried the spicy die-cut chips. Much better than the fries. A must-try!   My elder son ordered of the kid's menu, which had a kid's burger with KD on it!  (Yep!) That's KRAFT DINNER on a burger. He ate every bite.... I'm a proud momma.   My vegetarian 3-year old loved his KD and cucumber meal.   Drinks and dessert served in Anchor Hocking measuring cups? Love it.   Josh was great - all servers are energetic, peppy and efficient. We've met Gary, one of the owners, and he is great too.   This chain is a great addition to Bloor West Village. They are family-friendly, clean and well, we're regulars!"}
{"text":"Been here twice for food and once for just a milkshake. Really cool looking place with so many different options for a burger - and ONLY a burger. Haha. Their milkshakes are amazing but really filling. A little on the pricey side for a burger and fries though, once in a while is ok. For reference: two burgers w fries and two small milkshakes + a tip it was about $52. Great place for a date!"}
{"text":"So I'm a big fan of The Works in Ottawa, so we've tried this one a couple times and it really fell flat.  Well we were in the mood for a burger and decided, months later, to try it again. I don't know if it just took them a while to get their shit together, but man was the quality improved.  1)Burgers were super juicy, slightly pink, just perfectly grilled, unlike the dry, puck-like things we were served the other times we came when it first opened.  2)Their onion rings are now on par with Ottawa's Works, just spot on, especially if you get the chipotle mayo to dip in, which actually has some kick to it unlike most.  3)The drink menu has expanded a bit, now have a few more options for gettin' boozy wit it.  Is it still expensive? Yes. Not some place I'd go too often, but if you're in the mood for something DIFFERENT, highly recommend, even if you've been before in the past. From what I can see, they've stepped it up huge.  FYI, our order was:  Me: Jamaican Jerk burger, ground beef burger, white bun. Asked for a fried egg on it as well.  Wife: Peanut butter, banana & bacon, ground beef burger, whole wheat bun.  Both were fantastic."}
{"text":"The good first and foremost it was extensive menu with lots of choice and a lot of cool items. Decour was interesting and industrial in the Catholic back The bad must've had a super spaced out server basically we had asked for cutlery ,then we had to ask for condiments in the garage, then we have to keep trying to flag her down for refills, then we had to get charged for the kids dessert and we gave up after that. Now the burger bun was good not too big not too thin or dense etc. The meet was a little chart in a lot of flavour of my large was a good burger disappointing thing was paid nearly $70 for me so I would say it wasn't worth $70 but you have to use it and I will give it another try despite the price and the spaced out server"}
{"text":"Reviews had me worried about the line up, but it wasn't so bad! Two friends and I arrived on a Tuesday at 6:45 and were seated by 7pm; right in line with the 15 minute warning staff provided when I called to make a reservation (they don't take them).    After extensive fretting over a ridiculous number of burger topping options, I had:  THE LOVE GOAT (peppercorn crust, goat cheese, bacon) on a portabello mushroom cap. -Excellent. The peppercorn crust was amazing. The goat cheese was on the milder side, which was good because there was a lot of it. The bacon was baconomnomnom. All together, the flavours worked really well.  -I had a bite of the mushroom cap itself and it wasn't that tasty; however, the texture was excellent and nixing the beef made my large meal easier to stomach. It also made me feel less guilty about getting indulgent toppings, which is really the whole point of coming here.   W/ SWEET POTATO FRIES AND BEECHHOUSE SAUCE. -Excellent. Crispy on the outside, tender and sweet on the inside.  Beechhouse sauce I'd put somewhere between thousand island and aioli, very tangy and delicious.   2001 SHAKE ODDYSSEY(caramel, peanut butter and Oreo cookie crumbs). -\"I don't know if it's worth $5, but it's pretty f**kin good!\"  No, Vince Vega did not try my shake, but that classic Pulp Fiction line sums up this dessert. The 8oz kid's shake is $4.97. It's thicker and more complex than a milkshake ought to be (I, like Mia, enjoy classic vanilla best), but what it IS is freaking amazing. Glad I tried it. Won't pay $5 for it again.   Service was efficient, but all staff had their most annoying disingenuous \"waitress\" voices on, to the point where they didn't even sound like real human beings. Really though, at times their cadence was so unnatural I couldn't even understand what they were saying. At least my friends got a kick out of my awkward reactions, which ranged from bafflement to laughter."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for a burger, you won't be disappointed. However, you won't be Wowed. I expected more, because it's a gourmet Burger restaurant. There's nothing gourmet going on here. Had the Juicy Lucy."}
{"text":"I see that others have not had a great experience at this location.  This was my first visit to any of their locations and I must say I will be back for sure.    We were greeted promptly at the door and were given a table of our choice.  Decor was awesome, lots of time was put into all the details.  Drinks were served in large measuring glasses....salt and pepper shakers in the shape of light bulbs and on and on.  Menu choices were extensive.  Check out their website ahead of your visit as there are 68 different types of burgers alone.  I had \"The Full Mountie\" which is a burger topped with poutine....INCREDIBLE.  Had the fried pickes as a side and finished strong with a Chocolate Banana shake.  All were amazing.  I love a great burger and have tried Gourmet Burger Company and Holy Chucks in the Toronto area.  Those were good but this place takes it to a whole new level."}
{"text":"The Works Gourmet Burger Bistro is just that. What an incredibly creative burger menu! They offer appetizers, salads, poutine and a few sandwiches, but burgers are the star here.   We came with friends who'd seen a write-up in the News Advertiser. None of us had been. The decor is construction-themed and is divided into smaller groups of tables so it's not one big room. They're prepared for patio season with 2 large glass garage door style walls which will open to the outside (in cooler weather, the glass can be cold to sit next to as we experienced last night).  It was a packed Saturday night. Service was friendly. It did take awhile for our food to arrive.   A couple of us tried the shakes, served in Anchor glass measuring cups, almost too thick to drink through the straws. His was chocolate and he thought it was OK. Mine was chocolate banana (minus the banana syrup as I don't like artificial banana), with real banana. It was great! Very filling, though   We saw a tower of onion rings with dipping sauces that looked great. Two of us opted for the side dish upgrade to onion rings (+$3.56), one got fries and the other the spicy chips, made fresh.  The chips aren't too spicy. You get a bit of a kick at the end. The kid chose a traditional poutine and finished every bite.   The burgers with sides range from $10.98 to $13.96. They include everything from the usual toppings (on a Plain Jane) to pear, peanut butter, Brie, tiger shrimp, Montreal smoked meat, and so on.    They had a turkey dinner burger on special which featured stuffing and gravy and cranberry sauce.   I had the Porkgasm which had field mushrooms, smokey BBQ, cheddar and double-smoked bacon. The burger was well-done, but with the juice from the mushrooms and BBQ sauce, it exploded juice out the sides and up my arm to my elbow at first bite!  Expecting it was over, I tried again. My next bite sent juice onto my other arm and onto my table-mate. After a number of apologies and some extra napkins (and a warning to 'bite carefully' from the kid at the table), I nibbled the edges and had no more accidents but remained the subject of teasing sexy jokes throughout the evening.   Hubby had the Dead Ringer, loaded with beef brisket, BBQ sauce, jack cheese and an onion ring. He loved it, but the stacked meat on meat was too much for me.   Heads up:  the burgers are huge. I could barely finish mine and probably shouldn't have. Think I'll split one with hubby next time or skip the shake.   Here's how the menu works:  Step One, pick your patty:  beef, turkey, veggie, Portobello mushroom or chicken breast. Elk is +$3.39.   Step Two, topping combo:  60 choices!  Sections include Faves, Born to be Wild, Gettin Saucy, Cuz we Like it Hot, Carnivore's Corner, Veg Out, World Tour.  Step Three, choose a side:  fries, broccoli, celery, cucumbers, weeds, sweet potato fries, spicy chips, mashed, slaw.  Step Four, bun: white, wheat, gluten-free.  Step Five, add-ons (crispy dills, Kraft Dinner, etc.).   Location note: At night, the location in Pickering across from the mall (next to Loblaw's) is a bit hard to see as they're not listed on the sign tower. It's a separate building in the middle of the parking lot and while there are signs, they're not lit well."}
{"text":"Mmmmm hamburgers topped with wonderful toppings. Yes please. The Works is one of my fave \"Canadian\" food places and I'm glad my bf and I came here after the Jazz festival! I got the babewatch burger (cheese and avocado, super simple but yum) and my bf got some fancy avoacado burger as well. Our burgers were delicious and came quite quickly! I got the fries as my side but will definitely get the spicy die-cut chips next time. The fries seem tempting because it's bottomless so you can get as many re-fills as you want but the die-cut chips are SO good and I felt bad for snatching a bunch from my bf's dish haha. Full disclaimer, this place can get extremely busy especially the tiny outdoor area (there's only a few tables there). Also mad props to our delightful waitress (I forget her name but she was a young blonde girl) for being so friendly!"}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended so we decided to try it out. We happened to be in Pickering that night.  The menu was extensive and after awhile we decided on 2 burgers, one with fries and the other with rings. I was told how good the rings were but I have to say all I could taste was batter, and that was bland.  The burgers were tasteless and my wife's was over done. My Burger had bacon and peameal bacon - love bacon - but both bacons were obviously reheated from previously cooked. They were dry and tasteless.  I decided to un-assemble my burger and eat the parts. Burger was still tasteless. Peameal bacon was dry and regular bacon was not much better.  With so many burger joints to choose from, I think I will stick with South Street or Burger Priest.  Total bill including a glass of wine and a beer was $54.06!!!"}
{"text":"I got a \"getting piggie with it\" and it was just amazing! If you love pork this is the only thing you should try!!"}
{"text":"Service was non existent today. Waited for 20 minutes while looking at empty tables. In that time only acknowledged once to be repeated asked if we were there for takeout. I replied no, but the msg was passed on to another server that we were there for pickup."}
{"text":"Meh.  I love the idea of this place. I love the industrial look. I love the burger and app variety. What I question is the execution.   We ordered the SK8R Boy burger with PB and bacon. I have to admit I was really looking forward to the sweet and savoury, but there was barely any peanut butter to speak of. I mean, why do this half-assed?!! The spicy die-cut chips were great. The fries were nothing special.   Overall, I was pleased. Could be better."}
{"text":"The hamburgers are good, but there a re a few places in town that certainly rival and surpass The Works. Certainly The Works has the most selection but many feel to much is just too much confusing and it does take some time to work through a menu that probably could be half the size. To me a hamburger is only as good as the beef and the bun. The burgers here are good, but the bun is nothing to write home about. The fries are average and given the amount you pay for the average burger ($13) you would think that a few more fries would be in order. All ink all not bad, but I have a hard time dishing out $38 for two burgers, fries, and two pops when other establishments offer bigger burgers, better bread, and equally or better fries for under $25 for two."}
{"text":"WAY overpriced for what is a lot of hoopla and a basic hamburger/fries. Two fries, two small fries and two pops for $45? Crazy! Good selection of burgers but not worth the price!"}
{"text":"We tried this with a small group earlier in the year, opting for the new over the tried and true (and hit and miss) Yellow Griffin. The first thing you notice about The Works is the interesting decor. I'm not sure what they were aiming for, maybe some sort of truck stop theme, but it's entertaining at least.  Our waiter was quick to come. As he should have been; There was a very young looking manager standing up at the back of the restaurant, slightly elevated, watching over everything. It was very.. interesting, but our waiter was very nice, knew the menu completely and made some beer recommendations that our group was pleased with.  On the menu, there's plenty of variety and much like the aforementioned Yellow Griffin, there were plenty of unusual burgers to choose from. It was a pretty busy day and the food did take over twenty minutes to come. Burgers were very good and juicy, with quality buns. Fries were fine, but not entirely memorable. Soft drinks were served in hilarious measuring cups to go with the restaurant theme.  Overall it was a decent experience, but nothing special. Especially considering the price. We would definitely try this balance once more though if we were back in the neighbourhood and jonesing for a burger. You should at least try it out too."}
{"text":"This place is great cool looking nice atmosphere friendly staff and some great food honestly top 3 burgers I've had in my life give it a try I doubt you will be disappointed"}
{"text":"The Works Gourmet Burger Bistro is what it is. You will find the following:  1. Too many choices of beef, elk and other meat burgers with toppings ranging from avocados to Nutella to peanut butter. 2. All burgers are well-done. They don't ask how you want it cooked. 3. Their onion rings are very good. 4. Prices are moderate to slightly high. 5. Service is hit or miss always. 6. Decent beer selection, including draught (Barking Squirrel, among others) and bottle options. 7. Rather odd/gross signs on the washroom doors. You'll have to see for yourself. 8. Lots of kids, especially before 8 pm."}
{"text":"Such a variety of different burgers that were cooked to perfection!   We had the \"Crappy Tire\" - sweet and spicy sauce, pineapple and brie cheese. \"Canadian tire money accepted\".  Haha, props to the person doing the write-ups for the burgers they are hilarious. It was SO good.   We also shared the Poutine Chez Guy, very good but thought it could use more cheese curds.   The side of chips was also amazing, they were on the spicy side but so flavorful.   I had the Peppermint Patty Milkshake. Thought it would be a bit more chocolate-y but it really didn't have any chocolate flavor and honestly didn't even taste like much at all. Wish I had gotten a different flavor.   They serve all drinks in measuring cups. The novelty of this was cool when the milkshake came, but died down after my coffee and water also came in measuring cups and took up most of our small table for two.   Our server was fantastic, super friendly and always smiling.   We will be back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant bills themselves as a premium eatery. They charge above average prices for their food that would not be a problem if you were getting what you paid for. There are well over 50 types of burgers on the menu. If you are over 40 then you better bring your reading glasses as the menu is written on a crumpled paper bag that makes it very hard to read. We had a family meal out, so there were 4 of us dining this time. In a hope of getting a table that was not too loud, they put us into a small nook towards the back of the bistro. I had ordered a Jucy Lucy burger with the premium poutine. When I ordered, I distinctly asked if the poutine comes with real cheese curds. There is little sense in paying $4 more if you are just getting gravy and grated cheese. The place was pretty busy so I will give them time to cook the food and get it out. You don't want a burger that is not cooked right. On the plus side, the burgers they brought were pretty good. I found that the meat inside was not that flavourful, but I know I can be a bit picky some times. The meal showed up on a metal tray with the Poutine to the side. Esthetically it looked really nice. But sadly after pulling off the top few fried and parting the gravy to the side, I realized that they did not put in any of the cheese curds that I was promised would be in the dish. The real let down however was in the service or lack there of. When they delivered the meals, we asked if we could get cutlery. They showed up with 2 forks to share between the 4 people. The ketchup worked fine but the mustard was so old that the squeeze lid has dried up and turned black. It took 3 attempts to get extra forks and a knife for my Mother-in-law. It seemed as if they felt that once the food had made it to the table, their job was totally over and went out of their way to be unapproachable.  It was not until the very end of the meal that somebody bothered to come back to us and ask how our meal was. When I questioned the poutine, they took it away and came back saying that the curds had melted. They handed me back the poutine now swimming in too much gravy and several chese curds now inside. I just hope that the kitchen staff didn't spit or something worse for my protest about what I got.  After the rest of the party had left, I did ask one of the gentlemen who was wearing a black shirt rather than tshirts like the rest of the staff if he was a manager. With a coy remark trying to be funny said 'unfortunately'. when I tried to let him know in the most polite manner I could how sad I was about the service and quality of food I got, he tried to assure me that all the food is pre-measured and I must be mistaken about no curds. At which point I shrugged and gathered the only option is to write a review.  Perhaps I just got a bad experience. But when you add up all that went wrong and the attitude that came with it, I don't think this is a place that I would recommend. There are far better placed to eat along the lakeshore strip in Oakville. It is sad that places like this think they can get away with this sort of thing"}
{"text":"Tried the 'son of a beech' elk burger, was a bit dry but likely would have been great if it were juicier. Avacado was fresh, feta is good, the chips and multigrain bun were great. Definitely an adventurous foodie place, or great first date."}
{"text":"Good burgers, best onion rings I've ever had. Outside of forgetting to place my order, service was good. A little pricey, hard to justify that kind of money for a burger but I'm sure we will come back."}
{"text":"This isn't a fast food burger joint but more of gourmet burger restaurant like the name suggests. There are many ways to customize your burger. For the bread you can select white or brown bread. For the meat you can get the standard beef burger or select from a variety of different meats like Elk. You can also get the meat cooked the way you like just as you would for a steak. Finally there are different veggie toppings to choose from.   Ordered the Gettin' Piggy With It $15.73 + $2.32 to upgrade to a side poutine. Its a good burger that tasted great. Beef was juicy and thick and everything tasted fresh. It just didn't blow me away like some other burgers I have had. The poutine was also very good. Nice amount of cheese curds and gravy.  Price is on the high side for just a burger.  Service was excellent."}
{"text":"The Works is pretty awesome. I happened to come by on Halloween, and the entire place was decorated with cobwebs and caution tape. The waiters were all in Halloween costumes too- so cute!  The menu offers up so many choices your head may start to hurt. You can customize what kind of bun, patty and side that you would like to eat. If you ask for water, they give you large measuring cups that contains 2 cups / 500 mL, which is great because I drink an insane amount of water whenever I eat. We got Tom Green (gouda cheese, beechhouse sauce, bacon, avocado) and a kid's size Strawberry Shake (8 ounces). The side was the Spicy Bold Slaw, which tasted pretty gross so I'd recommend not getting it.   I quite like their burgers! The patty is nice and juicy, and \"made from 100% Canadian beef\" (taken from their website). You drizzle in as much ketchup and/or mustard as you like. The combinations are fun and it's a very family-friendly restaurant. The milkshakes are quite frothy and delicious, but also very sweet, so if you don't really have a sweet tooth you should get the kid's size and not the regular, which is 16 ounces or 2 cups. The burger came a little slow but it was during lunch time, so The Works had a lot of customers at the time.  If I'm ever in the area again I would definitely come back to try out some of their other stuff. I respect that they use purely Canadian beef instead of some mash-up of mystery meat."}
{"text":"The decorations were quite unique.  I came here to try their elk burger, and it tasted just like a burger, maybe just a bit gamey and that is pretty much it. Overall, its a-ok place to eat."}
{"text":"Service good. That's it. No wait..the decor also fine. Pricey for dry tasteless overcooked meat. Confusing and frustrating menu. Bland fries. Music atrocious unless you like MOR like Triumph and Toto. When we were asked for our choices we replied that the menu left us bewildered. The waitress responded that the many toppings are what makes a gourmet burger. No. Good meat does. My wife actually said that McD's would have been better."}
{"text":"I tried The Works in Ottawa about 2 years ago and loved it.  This one in Oakville does not have the same vibe at all.  Yet another over crowded downtown Oakville restaurant with the tables too close together.  The service was excellent, friendly and peppy but not so fast.  Total time in there was an hour which included long waits to order and to get the bill.  The food was very average and very over priced.  We had veggie burgers and they were your standard Cardinal patties that can be bought in the grocery store for about a buck and a half each.  Don't get me wrong, they're good but for a 14 buck burger I expected more than frozen patties.  Quantities were not what I'd call huge but there was enough food.  Side dishes were good, nice selection of fries or mashed potatoes etc.  Where The Works stands above a fast food joint is the interesting burger toppings, HUGE variety.  The lineups here are crazy.  I honestly cannot imagine lining up for a restaurant this average and this overpriced.  To put it in perspective you're getting a very similar burger to South Street or Licks (yes, fast food joints).  We were lucky, because we were a party of two they took us right away.  When we left there was about 20 people in line to get in...crazy!  Final thoughts: This is a very average burger joint with a small but funky selection of draft beers and wines.  Dinner for two, a burger & beer each ran $55.00 with tip.  A little steep for what you get in this place.  I thought it was OK but I won't hurry back and I'd NEVER stand in line for this place."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went here on Good Friday, as we were shocked that the business was open. We were seated much quicker than usual: the wait times are indeed a bit long, but that's to be expected when you're such an awesome burger place.  We were totally fascinated with the decor. The lightbulb salt and pepper shakers were a nice touch, and I laughed until I cried at the bathrooms being called \"dumping stations\". I was tempted to press one of the buttons on the wall, if I wasn't afraid of what would happen if I did (PS: they don't work).  The server was a young woman whom I believed was named Katie. Very nice girl, and was extremely helpful with making choices on the menu. She made a great burger recommendation and was very accomodating to my girlfriend, who is a vegetarian. She ended up ordering a tofu patty. Way to go, Works, for thinking of the vegetarians!  The free refills on drinks was a godsend, as the drinks are served in a one-pint measurng cup, which ensures that you get a lot of pop for the 3$ or so you pay. I was a bit annoyed that the root beer isn't served in a measuring cup as well; I think it's a bit too \"hipster\" to serve root beer in a bottle, and too many places do that.  The burgers are delicious, juicy and very filling. My girlfriend got the \"Gotta Be KD\" burger on a tofu patty, and I got the one with BBQ sauce and bacon (forget what it was called: it was a new offering on their MASSIVE burger menu). The burgers were layered with perfection, and I never once felt the need to season my burger with ketchup or mustard.  The price of the food was ideal. We ended up paying about 40$ for just food and pop, (generous) tip included. This is a really reasonable price, on par with the Kelseys in the area.  Would definitely return. One of the best restaurants on Lakeshore, hands down."}
{"text":"The best, \"gourmet burger,\" in Bloor West.  That doesn't mean it's great - but it's a good number of stars better than it's opposite across the street.    You're looking at twelve dollars for a burger here - and that comes with a side.  The sauces are delicious and the waitstaff are very informative.  They'll spend a good white talking you through what burger is best for you.  My wife, parents, and grandma all headed out - and on a very busy night we only had to wait twenty minutes for our table for five to be ready.  I also like that they don't do reservations - so when you see people leave, you know that table will be for you.  Everyone is on an equal footing here.  My grandmother had the basic burger - and when she asked if she could ask pickles, and tomatoes, she was told that they were free items.  And they were - all the, \"basic burger toppings,\" are free.  Another review claims that they were charged for these items - and I do not doubt that.  What I suspect is that either, A.) there was an employee who punched it in wrong, or B.) they have changed their policy.  I made sure to ask about the 'free-ness' of basic toppings.  My mother loved the Peanut butter burger (and having had one at another place, I was skeptical) but this one delivered.  Out of the five burgers we tried - the real winner was the one with avocado and jalapenos.   I'm not sure of the name.  Some people might find $13.00 for a burger steep, but compared to the other burger places in the city, it's on par.  And, you can ask to have your meat coked however you want.  You will also get your meat cooked the way you asked, which is a big surprise.  Medium rare does not end up medium.  It's a good treat - it's a nice place to sit down.  And the deep fried pickles?  They're the best I've found in this city.  Don't get me wrong - they're not super... but they're what you're looking for when you want a fix."}
{"text":"For the prices you pay, you can get the same exact, if not, even better gourmet burger at an upscale restaurant.  Plus, you would get better service and an even better ambiance.  Here, I think the waiters were trained to speak like robots and up sell the most expensive things on the menus: i.e. we were immediately introduced to their Elk Patty and the Tower-O-Rings.  Oh, their menus - I have to mention have a gazillion items on there - which totally confuses you!  I don't get it - when they basically switch up all the ingredients in each and renamed them to something special.  Totally pointless - Gordon Ramsay, would have detested this (as seen on Kitchen Nightmares) lolz...  Both items was really nothing spectacular for the price they charge.   I specifically wanted to complain about the Tower-O-Rings - basically, you are eating batter and just a tad bit of onions, if you're lucky.  You're better getting onion rings at Harvey's or South Street.  At least their ratio - onion to batter is almost equal.  And take it, 10 onion rings cost $9.99 - so $1.00 each and not all are the same sizes!!!  A big hype, all for nothing, I say!  I have to give credit to their creativity for the name - because it makes you want to try it.  I was one of the victims. =(     Overall, I think it's way overpriced for the quality of food they serve.   Let's just say, for 3 burgers + onion rings, our bill came up to $70 over and a bit - when you can easily fine dine for the same exact price but better food!   Should have settled for Sushi instead with that price.  Shucks!"}
{"text":"We went to the The Works for dinner and were hoping to have the best burgers in town. The ambience is average to good. The service was really great. Our server was very attentitve. However, he was sweating a lot and it would have been great if he could have taken a minute to look more presentable. Our food came in really late and the burgers were very average. The staff apologized for the late food service (by about 40 mins) and picked up our bill. We appreciated that gesture. I would be willing to give it a try again...think they were having a bad night."}
{"text":"The works is a decent joint. I come here whenever they send a coupon but I usually try not to because it's overpriced. They are adventurous in their burger assemblies but the burger patty itself is forgotten with all the ingredients put on it. Sometimes simplicity is best."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch had the Smoky Mountain burger with fries; my wife had the Chicken Fight Club with crispy dills both were great service was great - like the atmosphere as well would come back again"}
{"text":"This place is pretty top notch. I would've loved to have gone when I was actually hungry. So I could've ordered a big amazing burger. Instead of a small greek salad. My bf had a specials burger with an upgrade of poutine. It was a very small burger.  To me it looked like a kids size burger, and a poutine for about 11 bucks seemed pretty decent, I suppose. Would've been better had the burger been bigger. With places these days they always seem to be a bit skimpy, whereby you pay so much for so little and that's unfortunate!  My salad was fairly tasty for 4 bucks. It had a number of ingredients, cucumber, tomato, lettuce - the good kind, black olives, feta cheese, was it worth it? Well, let me say that it's a hell of a lot more I got in that salad then I would've buying it at Loblaws for a dollar more.  All in all,  I'd go back and try something more substantial, one of their burgers, what they're actually known for.  The service was alright. She didn't smile much and her demeanour could've been better, but maybe it was one of her off days."}
{"text":"Waited over an hour just to get our food on a Monday afternoon that was completely dead.  Burgers were dry as well so it really wasn't  worth the wait."}
{"text":"My colleague, Steve, and I had lunch today at The WORKS.  We both got a pop and it comes in a big measuring cup.  The pepper and salt shakers are cute.  Soooooooo many burgers to choose from!  Steve and I both ordered a Bacon You Fancy Huh? burger combo.  It's part of the Baconism III promotion so we got to fill out a ballot to win free burgers for a year (fingers crossed!).  Steve got his with chips.  I got mine with fries and side of gravy.  It was a good burger (I got mine without the arugula) and I ate it all.  It was tender and tasty.  The bacon on the burger was huge and sweet.  It was a big meal so I just had a few of the fries since I'd focused on the burger.  The gravy had an odd taste and I wasn't too fussy for it.  Sydney was our server.  She was friendly, chatty and took good care of us.  It's my first time at one of The WORKS restaurants and I'll be sure to check them out again!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad there is a location in the east end. I really enjoy this burger place. I came once before and really enjoyed it.  Ordered the Great Canadian (a specialty limited offering at the time) with Poutini Martini, which was basically poutine with onion rings.    The burger was fab, albeit huge!  I could only eat half. The poutine was...ok. I didn't like the onion rings. They were too sweet for my liking so I had to pick them out. Service tho, was great and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience.  I knew I'd be back.   Today was the day I returned, this time for lunch. I was pleased to see they have a lunch special. A 4oz burger, with side of fries and pop for $10.97.   I got the Hamburger Mary, with egg, cheddar, bacon and mayo. I also upgraded my fries to the poutine again. The burger was excellent and the right size for me.  The poutine however---wasn't good.  The gravy was too thick and not hot enough to melt the cheese curds and it was way too salty.  I won't be ordering the poutine again. It just isn't good.   Other than that, service was great and we've made plans to come back and try a different burger.  I'll just be opting for a different side next time."}
{"text":"I heard about The Works from a friend of mine who visited the Oakville location, he loved everything about it. My experience was far different from that. I visited this location with my boyfriend on a Sunday night. We were eager to try the menu considering we heard such good things about it, and that they had a huge and interesting selection to choose from! We ordered our drinks and meals without any issues. However, we waited roughly 50 minutes for our burgers to arrive. Other customers came and left during the time we were there. When our burgers arrived, one of the orders were wrong and the food was cold. They offered no discount or apology for the poor service.   I definitely wouldn't go back here."}
{"text":"This is the first burger place I tried in Toronto and it made me feel like home. The ambience is industrial, which made me feel like I was back home in Windsor. All the staff was friendly and willing to strike up a conversation with anyone who wanted to have one.  The food was fantastic! One bite into the burger was all I needed to be in food heaven. They have pretty good sauces to compliment the burgers and appetizers well. However, if I had to recommend one thing, it would be the milkshakes. There is a wide variety and they are a little expensive, but they are totally worth it."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in for takeout.  While the wait time after ordering was long despite the restaurant being empty, this isn't a negative as  everything was made fresh.  The burgers were delicious,  as was the poutine.  My four-star vs five-star rating is because of the price.  Our bill was astronomical.  While the food was really good, my visits there will be very limited if not non-existent because of the pricing.  There are far too many good burger options for me to be willing to drop $50 to eat here for two people."}
{"text":"I'm a little surprised by the lukewarm reviews for The Works.  Perhaps I just went on a good night or made superior topping selections, but my burger was phenomenal!  After what seemed like eons of studying the menu, I finally decided on the Leaside Burger (mushrooms, BBQ sauce, cheddar cheese & double smoked bacon).  I would highly recommend looking at the menu online prior to going to the restaurant as they have 60+ burger topping options to choose from (additionally, it takes approximately 20 minutes for them to make your burger, so you're going to want to get your order in as soon as possible).  You also get to pick which meat you'd like (beef, chicken breast, ground turkey, veggie patty, portobello mushroom, or you adventurous types can upgrade to elk for $3.39).  I went with the ground turkey and was not at all disappointed.  Often times turkey burgers can be super dry, but this was cooked perfectly (plus the BBQ sauce helped keep things moist and delicious). The bacon was definitely a welcome component to the burger, but really - that kind of goes without saying. I typically find that these burger joints serve substandard fries.  I'm not certain if it's because they're more focused on perfecting the art of a perfect burger and can't be side tracked by the sides. Or, it could be that they don't want the main attraction to be upstaged, so they intentionally sabotage fry preparation to ensure that those potatoes won't shine in the least. At The Works, however, they ACTUALLY have shockingly decent fries.  They offer alternative side selections as well, but I am more of a purest and cannot see myself ever ordering mashed potatoes or broccoli with a burger...that's just wrong.  Both my friend and I just had water with our meals and it came in Pyrex measuring cups. Not incredibly fond of this at all.  I understand that they're trying to be kitch, but it just seems forced.  I'm fine with them serving shakes in measuring cups to highlight how substantial they are, but for water? Ya, I'll just take a regular ol' glass thanks. This place gets pretty busy and they don't take reservations, so be prepared to wait a little while."}
{"text":"i want to not love The Works. BUT I DO AND I CAN'T HELP IT!   The Works is a chain. There are a few locations but this one is the most convenient for me, so I find myself here more often than I'm proud of.   Since overhauling their menu, there are fewer burger choices (there were WAY too many before) and as well, some non-burger options (I don't know why anyone wouldn't get a burger if they're at a burger place).   What's so great about this place? Lots of options and customizations! There are lots of patty choices, beef, elk, veggie, chicken, turkey, etc., lots of bun choices, including gluten free, and lots of side choices, including KRAFT DINNER (legit KD!), salads, and their spicy die-cut chips which are fantastic.   This place is actually completely gluten-free-friendly, the only thing that has gluten on the menu (I believe) is the KD.   Some burger favorites:  Gotta Be KD - that's right, KD in melted cheddar on the burger! Sk8r Boy (I think?) - PB and Bacon on a burger!  Down Under - beets and egg!!   Drink wise, they have excellent shakes and delicious Caesars, as well as decent beer list.   This location is always busy, but it's a big place so we haven't had to wait.  Oh, and they do take out! So you can avoid the shame of being there too often by popping by the takeout window. Good thinking The Works."}
{"text":"Servers/waitresses are wonderful....the \"good\" ends there. Waited close to 10 minutes in a growing line to be seated when the restaurant was half empty (it's not a big place - the hostess was just absent). Then waited over an HOUR for our food - there were no more than 20 guests/7-10 occupied in the entire place, several of whom were already eating. When the food did come it was lukewarm. Our lettuce was red and brown around the edges. The (cold) poutine gravy was powdery and several of our (cold) fries had a powdery substance on them that I assume was pure gravy powder. Both of our water glasses (measuring cups) were dirty and had clear dirt marks. (And, not food related, but the women's washroom was absolutely disgusting - I could barely walk in due to the smell of vomit) I have been to The Works once or twice before and had a good experience, but I am honestly so disgusted with the wait times and poor food quality on this visit that I doubt I will return. I really wish I could blame this one bad experience on \"dinner rush\", but the restaurant was not busy at ALL - simply no justification and I am totally at a loss as to how our food could possibly have taken over an hour, and turned out so badly."}
{"text":"Being an avid fan of a good burger, I had heard much about this place and it's gourmet burger. So on a Thanksgiving Monday we decided to try it out. Having had a huge Thanksgiving meal the previous day, I probably could have done without , nevertheless..  First impressions, the place is very trendy, love the decor. It was very quiet hardly any customers, but keep in my mind it was Thanksgiving.   The server was great and very knowledgeable about the menu. Since this was our first time he took his time to explain the menu as it can be overwhelming at first.  We settled on two burgers, one was the Maple burger (just lovely) and the other was Turkey burger. We also got a side our poutine, healthy right!   The food did take longer than expected given that there was only couple besides us in the whole place, however the burger was great. The maple on the bacon was divine, the turkey burger was good but kinda dry.  The price tag is a bit hefty for two burgers, poutine ($40) but I knew that going in. I would suggest Baldwin Burger in Brooklin over this place"}
{"text":"I was really disappointed with my most recent visit here. The service was very slow and we waited for lengthy periods of time at each stage of the meal. My sister and I both ordered a turkey burger. I received a veggie burger. By the time I got the server's attention again my husband was almost finished his meal. My sister ended up letting me have her turkey and she ate my veggie. My sisters broccoli was all brown and she couldn't eat it. The coffee and the french fries are supposed to be \"bottomless\" but we were never asked if we wanted more of anything. We waited quite awhile after asking for our bill. Which turned out to be the wrong bill. We had to wait longer for our waitress to come back and then again to get the correct bill. All in all a regrettable choice for trying to impress my visiting sister. I can only hope this was a one of and that IF I go back it will return to the standard I remembered from previous visits."}
{"text":"This burger place sprung up in Bloor West where the old Payless Shoe store use to be.  I had passed by a couple times and was curious to try it when a friend suggested meeting up for lunch.  I browsed the menu online before we went and was blown away by the choices.  I even chuckled at some of the snippy comments beside some selections.  We arrived outside of the lunch hour so there was no wait for a table.  Our server dropped off menus and took drink orders right away.  I decided against all the gourmet toppings and just go for something basic so that I could taste the flavour of the beouf.    I chose the Ho Hum #2 beef burger (cheese and crispy bacon) with fries and gravy while my health nut DC chose the Mel Lastman turkey burger (goat cheese, spinach, red peppers) and added avocado with steamed broccoli as the side.  I really love tomatoes and pickles on my burgers but those were only available as an \"upgrade\"...hello, $3.56 for pickles?  Really?  Tomatoes not even listed as an option for a side.  And honestly, when my burger already cost $12.74, by the time I request tomatoes and pickles, it's going to be a $20 burger!  The menu advertised a 1/2 lb beef patty so I was expecting it to be huge.  When my burger arrived, it wasn't super big...just average size.  The waitress warned that because the burgers are made fresh, there could be traces of pink which I was fine with and was actually excited for because it's rare that restaurants would serve burgers slightly on the pink side.  To my disappointment, the patty in my burger was dry and overcooked.  Without tomato or pickle, it made the burger as a whole even drier.  The fries were good though - properly cooked and crispy.  Fountain drinks were served in a Pyrex measuring cup for novelty sake and are bottomless.  With the measurements, at least I can keep track of how much liquid I'm ingesting.  Burger prices are a bit on the high side and not really justified.  Lack of pickles and tomatoes on the burgers deters me from going back any time soon."}
{"text":"Worst service EVER!!! Went there with my parents and kids one day (6 people).  We got there around 2, no one came to our table for 20 minutes.  When we placed the order it took over an hour with someone telling us every 10 minutes any minute now.  When the food came they screwed up my kids meals completely!!! Ended up walking out and starving... Went over to Big Boy and was served promptly and without error"}
{"text":"Great burger and fun atmosphere - really liked the vibe in this place complete with a Led Zeppelin soundtrack. Tater Tod pouting was tasty and the loaded Lucy burger was delicious. Fries were just okay. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The Beach hood is a desert of real estate butt-faakery...let's not kid ourselves. The north side of Queen is where every thing happens and the south side is where everything gets ignored. In general, there's no where good to go when you are starving like a longshoreman and want a pint of beer to wash it down and maybe hang for another pint. That is normal behaviour in most European cities, I'm looking at you, the people of Toronto who are on a constant colon cleanse, drinking lemon juice and cayenne pepper and wreaking havoc on your puckered up buttholes.   In the beach, it's either coffee shops, tea shops, or really dumb restaurants that cater to women who wear Lululemon yoga pants and push empty strollers stuffed with probiotic groceries while their toddlers are at a Montessorri pop-up school. They are not the MILFs from your favourite Tumblr blog, so don't get excited and hop a streetcar over here expecting some fantasy fulfilled by some perceived loose/frustrated pussy.  These women run a tight ship and wouldn't dream of drinking at lunch, they have no time for you because they are always in a hurry to \"pick something up\" or \"run an errand\" before their husband gets home. In other words, they're getting it some place else, obviously.  Anyway back to my needs and yours:  Finally, the Gods of Gluttony heard my prayers and opened up a Works, ON THE SOUTH SIDE of Queen (people,  you need to cross the street once in awhile)  which is a chain burger joint.  I'm not going to lie: ordering for the first time is hard work. I could barely handle it. I am a Burgers Priest gal and like plain simple things. The menu has to be explained and the the waitress we had was so helpful and lovely that it all worked out well...I ended up with a cheese burger with caramelized onions and horse radish but it had some kind of biblical sounding name that I can't remember.  Keep things simple, I always say but no one listens so maybe just shut up and go with the flow. It was a really good burger.  The fries rock big time. And that is how I judge a joint. I love me my meat but I am a carbo-fatty at heart and I could drink the gravy, my friend loved the onion rings and we had deep fried pickles!  What a delight!    The service was great!  We had wine with our meal, and then a beer for dessert. And then another beer. For lunch! Yes, that is how we hookers roll on the other side of the street in the middle of the day, kittens."}
{"text":"Burgers were pretty good and my wife loved the fries.  However the service is terrible, as mentioned by a few users here already.  We could never flag down the staff as they were always chatting in the back and never refilled our water.  Asked for mayonnaise but the waitress went back to chat with the chefs and had to ask again. Would have been OK if they were busy but the place was pretty empty and with 3 waitresses attending to 6 tables or so there should be no excuses."}
{"text":"Great burger place and very kid friendly. A huge selection of burgers- hard to pick with such a large list though."}
{"text":"Really cool place to grab a bite and a pint. All the items have kitchy names and the general atmosphere is unique and almost industrial. I got the Life on the Vedge burger and it was delicious.  I also got the Wrecking Balls and those are a must-have! I would not suggest the spicy die cut chips, they're a miss."}
{"text":"#TheWorks is a chain I can get behind.  For others suffering from CBM (Chronic Burger Mania), find the nearest location near you. I love the Bank St location in Ottawa so I was so happy to spot this one from my habitual Toronto streetcar.   Please give it a try and tell me this All-Canadian gem doesn't deserve a tip of the hat. So many gourmet burgers to choose from, it's unreal (challenge accepted!!)  I don't know what my favorite one is and I'll probably die trying new ones out.   I can also tell you I love the service and the decor at the few locations I've visited. i vow to try the poutine every time but I get so burger obsessed... please don't judge me.  I RECOMMEND: The Sweet Ride, Not Yo Burger, Sound of Munching and the 3 Ring Binder.  EXTRA TIP: The Works on Bloor West and the new location on the Danforth have nothing on this Queen St station."}
{"text":"Waaaay overrated burgers. The quality of the meat, which is what I'm looking for in a burger, is ok at best. It was cooked fine and with a decent bun, but instead of giving me 100 different choices of toppings and crazy burger styles, just make a good burger man. I'm always suspicious of places that cover their burgers in a tonne of cheeses, sauces and condiments...I feel like it's hiding how good or not good the burger ACTUALLY is. Plus they screwed up our order and it took considerably longer than it should've."}
{"text":"Went for the first time last week with my girlfriend and we absolutely loved it. The waitress was extremely nice and the burgers we got were perfect. Wouldn't change a thing!"}
{"text":"Elk burger is so worth it! I'm really sad the portion decreased over time but nonetheless the quality is still the same and I'm really happy about that!"}
{"text":"I've heard very good reviews about this restaurant from my friends. My boyfriend, sister and I decided to give it a try. Their special lunch menus included 6 burgers, which included a soft drink of your choice, and regular side dishes (fries, coleslaw, etc.). I always ordered the kamikaze burger since I like spicy food, and it was great. I personally liked the spicy sauce that came on the side. We also ordered the tower of rings. When it came, it was a lot smaller that I expected. It had about ~12-15 onion rings stacked up. It just tasted like regular onion rings, so nothing special about it.  What I was most impressed about was their poutine. I always get their longhorn poutine, which is now my new favourite. The portion is huge, so it's great appetizer to share with other people. It was really good because they completely cover each layer of fries with the identified topping listed on the menu.   The customer service is also very good. The server would immediately attend to your order, and very well mannered. They would spark some small conversation, which is always nice. My boyfriend and I met the owner one time, and he gave us coupons for free tower of rings if we purchase any meal (included the lunch special) when we left. Overall, my experience was great."}
{"text":"Only went to this location once as opposed to a few times in Kingston, but the burgers, shakes, and style were good all the same. This one only gets 4 stars though because the one night I went a while back they were down to a single beef pattie. How does that happen at a burger restaurant?! Haha"}
{"text":"** 200th Review **   My best friend and I were in the area because we wanted to go to High Park. We were hungry and craving a burger, so after searching nearby restaurants, this one came up and we decided to pay a visit.  Upon arrival, we had to wait for a while because there was no server around. Once she came, she provided us with a table and wow, it was burning hot in the restaurant! Sadly, the service was horrible. It was extremely hard to get our server's attention despite only 3 tables being full (3 including us). Trying to ask for items, placing the order and even getting the bill was a drag. Even though she hardly checked on us and disappeared for quite some time, she was nice.  The restaurant itself was really clean which I loved. It had a different vibe, but a good one.  The food? Wow, it was amazing! A lot of my friends kept raving about the burgers here and I've been wanting to try it. I'm so happy I came here. I got the Juicy Lucy burger and it was delicious. The size of the burger was insane, it was huge! Definitely worth the money. As my side, I got sweet potato fries, but it wasn't amazing. I definitely had better sweet potato fries elsewhere."}
{"text":"Came here after a 5-star experience at the Toronto location. Service was just as good but the server apologised for the wait. We were seated by the door on a cold, windy night.  We asked to be moved as it was so cold I couldn't remove my coat,  and they were so apologetic and nice about it,  and moved us immediately.  I ordered the \"sum young guy\",  giggling. My husband had the pony express.  Both were fabulous,  if a little bit well done. Luckily,  we both prefer medium-well,  so it wasn't hard to enjoy. That's the only reason this location is only getting 4 stars.  If you prefer less well-done, I'd maybe try a different location.  I can't wait to go back in summer when they open the overhead doors!"}
{"text":"Awesome gourmet burger place. They have a huge selections of burger choices - there's something for everyone here.  I tried the Mayday burger - with BBQ sauce, caramelized onions and bacon. It was messy but an excellent burger The french fries are great here too."}
{"text":"This review is for the excellent customer service and the poutine. I have to say the whole time we were in Canada we encountered some of the kindest people and this place really put the cherry on top. We came here on a chilly night ready to get our poutine fixes. Because we were on a time crunch we decided to place a to go order outside at the door. They informed us it would take about 15 mins and told us to have a seat inside so we could warm up while we waited.  Perhaps 10 mins go by and out comes our poutine. We then realized that we didn't have any place to actually inhale our delicious food but felt bad asking for a table since we ordered it to go. The manager, seeing that we looked a bit confused asked if he could do anything for us and we told him the situation. He smiled and graciously opened up a private room for us just so we could eat our poutine in peace and warmth. He also told one of the waiters to check up on us in case we needed anything. We all really appreciated that kind of hospitality and it really left a lasting impression. The poutine was delicious as well, we got one with beef brisket and one loaded potato. Keep up the great service!"}
{"text":"Awesome burgers! Just maybe one of the best burgers I've had. I loved the almost endless choices and ways to customize it. We tried poutine for the first time, I must admit it was pretty good."}
{"text":"Just came here on a sunday night with my boyfriend. First time at the works because we got  coupon in the mail and decided to try it out.   The atmosphere: casual and rustic looking, we liked it for a burger place very suitable.   The food: we had the stuffed lucy (amazing) the barking on the cows or something (messy, huge and really tasty), side orders were sweet potato fries (good-nothing out of the ordinary) and onion rings (amazing!!)  Speed of food and service: Ordered and got everything in 15 mins which is great. Got water ASAP. Got seated and menus ASAP.   The service: This is where it really made this place 5 stars. Our waiter was a young man with blonde down the middle of his hair (if the manager is reading this give this guy a HUGE pat on the back because he is what made this from a 4 star to a 5 star) He was very quick with everything but not impatient, he answered all our questions and explained the menu and coupon, he walked around our area every 5-10 mins but didn't ask us \"is everything ok\" every single time which is very annoying that a lot of other places do he just observed if everything was ok and used his brain basically. I've been to some 5 star restaurants downtown and this guy was better in my opinion. AND he had like 5 other tables which 4 of them were groups.    I will def. tell my other friends to come and we will come again. Purely on the customer service alone."}
{"text":"I've been to a few locations and this is the worst. We've been here twice and had a horrible experience both times.  Portions seem smaller than other locations, they got the orders wrong both times, and the wait for food was over 45 mins even though it wasn't that busy.  We'll stick to the works in brampton next time."}
{"text":"Fantastic lunch specials with a generous servings of fries and a large drink. I had the Mary burger which came with a sunny side egg. The Works has a huge selection of burgers, and the next time I want to try the Trudeau burger to see if it's as amazing as it sounds!"}
{"text":"Despite the food being average, the hospitality wasn't so good. After long humid day I was told by the manager that my service dog couldn't eat or drink. Reason being its against public health dept., I don't know if it's true or not but I would have appreciated a better service in terms of hospitality by the manager. After ordering a small snack for my service dog and then told he couldn't have it, logical this to do was to refund me. None took place, I paid and left as the entire waitress staff apologized for the managers actions. As a disabled vet, this is exactly why most do not venture out to chain restaurants like this."}
{"text":"went to this location because my friend has gone to the locations in ottawa.  i was shocked at the amount of flavors and variety of the burgers available.  how they serve the food is even more hilarious. i got a sprite, which came in a measuring cup, the poutine came in a mini bucket, and my friends onion rings came on a spirl tower(no pictures sorry!) really reasonably priced, for the quality of food that is put out, everything was fast and efficent as well.  5+/5"}
{"text":"Once a order has been placed a burger should not take 30 mins to deliver, however, that is exactly what happened when I was there. If it does take that long it should be way better than its competitors which I do not think it is. I enjoyed better burgers at South West Burgers in half the time. Compared to its competition the burgers are slightly overpriced.  I doubt I will be going there again."}
