{"text":"I was in Montreal for a girls weekend. We stumbled upon Boccone in the Little Italy section of Montreal.WHAT A FIND! The ambiance, service and food was amazing. Our waitress Veronica & waiter Carlos were fantastic- the owner Sammy was very hospitable and even sent over a complimentary appetizer that was like a meal. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Traveling through, this is probably the 3rd time we stopped at Boccone. The food is good, not great but good! I had a caesar salad and hubby had a \"calzone\" type pizza, it was okay.... I had a cappuccino, that was delicious! But ultimately what made our day was our server, Cecelia.  Even though she was busy, she remained friendly, she never lost her smile and for that she should be commended.  Here is hoping next time we come through, Cecelia will be working again!"}
{"text":"Tea was good but the food at 6:00am dried out and cold. I had scrambled eggs and sausage with hash browns and toast for  $12:00 total  $14:00 with the tea. Overpriced like all the food at the airport, scant selection of eateries in this gate area - and no Tim Hortons!  A bag of chips would have been better. Save your money folks and eat at home first!"}
{"text":"Had a great dinner at Boccone, full of delicious and authentic Italian dishes. The grilled octopus entrée was definitely the highlight of our meal, the best I've ever had at a restaurant. This was followed closely by my spaghetti alle vongole which was perfectly executed. I would highly recommend Boccone to anyone looking for a cosy Italian restaurant in Little Italy, with delicious food and great service. Boccone also has three dining rooms, two of which are private, so it is also a great venue option for family gatherings and corporate events.

{"text":"Not only the best Italian food I've ever tasted, but also one of the best dining experiences I've had. The building is beautiful, the food tastes amazing, and the waitstaff was attentive (without hovering) with a great sense of humor and wit. Everything from the food, to the ambiance, to the service was entirely comforting."}
{"text":"Adam got a mushroom pizza here and it was just eh. A big expensive and very ordinary tasting. 

You do have limiting choices if you're at the airport though so maybe you will still end up here."}
{"text":"This is the best Italian food I have had since I was in Italy last year!! The staff was so friendly and was always around if we needed anything. It was fairly priced for the portions and the wine list was reasonable as well. The ambience was so great for a group of friends! I would highly recommend this restaurant in the Little Italy section of Montreal."}
{"text":"Il viennent de déménager sur Jean Talon. Nourriture et service toujours excellents dans un créneau ou il est difficile de se différencier. On ne se trompe pas au Boccone!"}
