{"text":"AMAZING ETHIOPIAN FOOD!!  Literally the best we've ever had and we've eaten at so many different African restaurants across the country!  It came out very hot and fresh, the owner and sweet cook in the back couldn't be nicer!  Not really situated for larger parties, there were four of us and we ate outside as it seemed easiest with the small tables.  They specialize in take out and delivery.    I wish we lived here and could visit all the time!    Fantastic vegan foods and the best part is you get to choose your own combo!"}
{"text":"Good for delivery in the downtown area. Order well in advance."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. The owner recommended what we should order and prepared it himself along with his wife and mom. They are very friendly and would definitely go back. It was a great value for a lot of food."}
{"text":"There are so few options for lunch hour in downtown Phoenix. While other cities enjoy a wealth of ethnic food options, we Phoenicians know you have to travel to the 'burbs to get that here. Oh, how I long for a Halal chicken/rice cart on the Corner of 1st Ave/Washington...or a kebab stand by City Hall...(sigh).... Anyway, tired of the usual options, I was browsing GrubHub and noticed that this place delivers for a VERY reasonable price. It took about 75 minutes from phone-order to food-in-hand. However, it was well worth the wait!  I got a 4-item veggie combo, plus sambusa, and  spicy cottage cheese. The food was SO flavorful, just amazing. Exactly how Ethiopian should be - rich in flavor and spice! And the quantity was perfect for a hungry big boy like me. The jalapeño stuffed with onion/tomato was a nice touch.  I will DEFINITELY be ordering again."}
{"text":"The food here is always delicious.  We didn't really know what we were getting, but everything we ordered was so good.  The mother and son who operate the restaurant are extremely friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"This place is so full of flavor and friendliness. It's clean and colorful. They keep it real by keeping it family owned and operated."}
{"text":"Seriously tasty food!  I ordered some beef sambusas, the Meat and Veggie sampler with chicken, beef, split peas and collard greens, and a Green Lentil salad.  The food arrived hot and fresh, and the injera (a sourdough flatbread common to Ethiopian cuisine) was so huge it had to be folded over double in the takeout box!  As far as flavor went, the spices were spot-on;  The spicy beef stew had a good (but not vicious) kick to it, the mild chicken had a lighter flavor with mildly sweet overtones.  I'm not usually a fan of veggies, but the collards and split peas nicely balanced out the richness of the meat portions.  The sambusas (light, flaky pastry shells stuffed with your choice of filling - kind of like Samosas in Indian cuisine) were generously filled and like the meat stew above, had a nice zing to them.  All that aside though, the star of the show was the green lentil salad, a simple blend of cooked lentils, spices, chopped chile peppers, and seasoned with a lime juice dressing.  This salad would be amazingly refreshing on a hot Phoenix summer day!  Best of all, they even deliver!"}
{"text":"Very low expectations for Ethiopian delivery...however, my experience was stellar! My food was delivered hot and fresh, and was exactly what I was craving. The price is incredible, I ordered a huge meal and with delivery, tax and tip it was only $19. Expectations surpassed! Fantastically cooked and spiced meats and veggies, all atop a generous portion of fresh, moist injera. I'm so glad I moved to this neighborhood and can have this food whenever I want it. It's THAT good. Order about 75 mins before you want to eat. It takes a while, and not because they are screwing off at the restaurant. It's all made fresh!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite eatery in Phoenix. So good, and excellent prices! My boyfriend and I have since moved away from Phoenix and are sad we can't come here anymore. I highly recommend this place (the meat and veggie combo is a great way to try Ethiopian food for first-timers!)"}
{"text":"Always drove by but never have stopped.  Tonight with a couple from the neighborhood our casual bike ride led us to the small, cozy restaurant with a couple of cafe tables on McDowell.  The Friday traffic was a little heavy but we didn't mind as we were engrossed in conversation. My wife spoke with the man behind the counter who asked her to trust him when creating the order for four.  A short time later he arrived with platter a variety total deliciousness!  Next time I go back, and there will be many times hereafter, I'm going to delve into and explore the menu so that I could be more knowledgeable for my review.  In short all you have to know, the food was damn good, incredible spices -- what eating is all about!   They now created a regular customer!  Most likely, \"Authentic Ethio African\" restaurant will be rolling off my lips when replying to: \"Where do you want to go to eat tonight?\""}
{"text":"Love this place! Delicious, very reasonably priced and wonderful friendly service. They do mostly delivery, but have a small dining room. Definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Found this place on our last night in Phoenix. The neighborhood looks a bit shady at night but  that might be different during the day.  Small eatery and take away place with four tables only.  Andrew takes care of his guests and makes you feel at home.  As it was the end of the day, we let him decide what we would have and we were not disappointed.  Great food, friendly atmosphere. Good value for money.  We will be back every time we pass in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I think most of the reviewers here need to cut this place some slack. It is clearly a small, family owned business that makes your food when you order it - so it takes some time.  Good news, they are on grub hub and they deliver. I suggest simply giving them a good hour to bring you your excellent order. I would rather have a hot serving of freshly cooked food after a long wait, than old food that was cooked hours ago and arrives quickly.   Anyway, the meat and veggie sampler was excellent!   The Samosas are a bit greasy and not exactly to my liking - I prefer a lighter pastry. But others may like them."}
{"text":"Excellent Ethiopian food made with care and attention. The flavors were fresh and complex and the injera was fantastic. I would highly recommend this restaurant for a healthy, homemade meal!"}
{"text":"Awesome place!! I was really impressed. I was really concerned walking up to it. It's really small kinda run down. But the food is awesome the service is great and no lie the injera is the best I have ever had. My favorite was the spicy lentils. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for good Ethiopian food. The service was excellent the owner was really nice and really helpful. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place is tiny. Take your expectation for how small it might be and cut it in half. It's very easy to miss. Inside there are three or four two top tables, and that's it. If you go with more than 3 people it might be tough to find a way to sit. Just something to be aware of.  Everything was perfect. When we arrived we were greeted by an extremely friendly guy. He made us feel right at home. The food was fantastic. It was every bit as good as Ethiopian I've had in Tempe, but the dishes were a little spicer and more defined. When we left he explained that he's running the place with the intention of having a carry-out/delivery operation.   Our total bill for 6 entrees and two diet cokes was 12 dollars. Yeah... 12 dollars. He said that he has his kitchen set up so that you could bring enough food to feed 2 people 5 dinners for 30 bucks. Crazy. Next time I think I'll just call in an order and pick it up."}
{"text":"I've never had Ethiopian food but heard about this place from a cab driver I had in Las Vegas. I live in Phoenix so I frequent different types of restaurants often. My boyfriend and I ordered the veggie plate with 4 sides and two lentil sambusas. We had the beets & potatoes, the cabbage & carrots, the red lentils, and the peas sauce. The food was amazing! It was so much food, I was so glad we shared a platter. We ate nearly the whole thing and couldn't stop eating it. The food was authentic, spiced well and will definitely be on my list of favorites. I can't wait to come back here again!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to grab some Togo food with my husband last night as I had seen all of the fantastic reviews. We had had Ethiopian food a few years back and I was excited to try it again. It was absolutely fantastic! Everything was so fresh and full of flavor and the owner was just the sweetest man. We got the vegetarian platter and sambusas. The Sambusas were our favorite for sure, but who doesn't like anything fried?? We will definitely be coming back to support this neighborhood business and their crazy amazing authentic food!"}
{"text":"Small authentic Ethiopian restaurant with great food! The owner is happy to help with suggestions, ask you what you like and give you a recommendation. If you like the hole-in-the-wall authentic places, this is definitely a good one to go to. The food portions are great as well along with the pricing!"}
{"text":"This place was my first experience of Ethiopian food, and WOW, I'm hooked! Delicious variety of flavors (and hardy vegetarian options), and holy cow, with all that injera I can usually make three whole meals out of one    Last but definitely not least--the owner is incredibly kind and gracious.  All in all, this might be the best discovery of my year."}
{"text":"Wow! I loved everything about this place. My girlfriend and I went there for dinner today and I must say, it was an awesome experience. The gentleman working was so helpful and friendly. He explained to us that his mother, himself, and his wife run this restaurant. He gave honest recommendations. The place is a little small, but I really did love the vibe in there. We got the vegetarian platter and tried all of their vegetarian food. Phenomenal! The flavors were out of this world. Give it a try, guys!"}
{"text":"What more can I say except AMAZING! From their food, to the service I have been delighted to be a customer of theirs since the restaurant opening a few years ago. I have referred friends and family near and far for their different food choices, as well as their ability to cater different events (birthdays, weddings, graduations, etc.) Authentic Ethio African Spices recently catered my large wedding and handled it perfectly! We originally expected a large crowd of about 600 guests, but there were a couple hundred more that attended. During this time Authentic Ethio and staff were able to effectively and efficiently cater the wedding with amazing Ethiopian food dishes. Our guests are still raving and talking highly about the food. Thank you Authentic Ethio for making our wedding so special on our day! We will continue to be lifelong customers! 5 Stars *****"}
{"text":"This was such a surprise to find. A rare gem in a huge city! Now one of my top five places in the valley. I wish I would have known of this place when they first opened!! Also, they do deliver with Amazon so even though I'm in the N valley I can still get good eats. Try the fresh tea, it's fantastic. Thanks for a great meal :)"}
{"text":"I understand what reviewers mean now by this is better as a delivery or take-out place. If you are looking for a sit down place, go elsewhere. It's not because it is small - on the contrary I LOVE hole in the wall places - but rather because customer service isn't really priority.  Just as an example - we came and ordered a meat/veg combo. I asked for beef and chicken for the meat entrees. Rather than tell us they were out of chicken, when our food came out the guy told us he gave us two beef entrees because they were out of chicken. I guess it would have been nice to be asked rather than having made the decision for me.. I could have asked to try another meat entree or something instead of 2 beefs? Small gripe but it was a bit strange.  The beef was delicious and they made it extra spicy for me too! It's made fresh so that's why it takes a LONG time before your food is ready - that's one of the reasons ordering for pick-up or delivery is better than coming to dine.  The meat/veg combo has bigger portions but less selection (2 meats and 2 veg I think?) than the combos at another nearby Ethiopian place. Food definitely tastes great and I have no qualms with it - just that I would much prefer ordering for take-out than dining in.  It's a family run shop so I feel shitty giving a bad review. However, I definitely prefer the other Ethiopian restaurant.  Also, apparently sambussas here are $2 a piece when we inquired. That seems quite steep compared to $3 for 3 sambussas elsewhere? Not sure if the owner misunderstood my question, because that seems quite expensive...  TL;DR Order here for take-out and delivery. Go elsewhere otherwise."}
{"text":"This little restaurant in the Coronado/Brentwood area of Phoenix is so tiny that it would be easy to miss if you were not actually actively looking for it. But it is a powerhouse of great flavors and a boon to vegetarians and meat lovers alike. Because my friend and I were unsure of what to order, we took the owner's suggestion and ordered a sampler plate. We came after the lunch rush, so the food was served after just a short amount of time. We received a large platter completely covered with injera bread, on which were arranged portions of lentils, cabbage, and meat dishes. Everything was delicious, and we were grateful for the side basket of extra injera bread.The meal was really pleasant and satisfying, and the only thing that could have made it even better is if the injera were served warm rather than at room temperature; after mentioning that, we were told that they would certainly accommodate us for that for our next visit."}
{"text":"I was there on a Saturday both at 11:30 and noon expecting a delicious meal. Both times the door was locked and the sign said closed. I could smell the food cooking and the lights were on inside so I know someone was there. To be fair I have eaten there in the past, although not for roughly 6 months, and the food was awesome. Is it wrong for me to think that a business should be open during posted business hours? No, no it's not!!!! Sorry Andu, 1 star."}
{"text":"Love this place so much, the owners are so friendly and the food is wonderful. I'm really sad that they no longer deliver."}
{"text":"What a delicious find! The food was so good! Just the right amount of spices- so authentic. The restaurant is certainly small. Don't expect white tablecloth or waiters waiting on you. It's  a real deal place. The food is made to order. Their meat and veggie platter is the way to go! Yum!"}
{"text":"Food was homemade by a very nice couple.  I had the beef with a side of cabbage.  The food was nice and spicy just the way I like it.  The bread was excellent.  Only four stars because the meat was tough.  My suggestion is to marinate for a few day first.  Good for flavor and makes cheaper cuts of meat more flavorful."}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible Ethiopian food. The flavor was delicious, the portions were huge, and the price was so low my wallet cried tears of joy.  Also the injera was so soft and fluffy and perfect that I used it as a sleeping bag and took a nap right on my plate."}
{"text":"Awesome food and friendly staff.  Must try! Spicy beef and the beets are are a must try."}
{"text":"I love this place. Best Ethiopian food in town. I always make it a point to stop in and pick up some red lentils and cabbage when I pass through Phoenix. Sooooo good. Also, the family who runs it is really sweet. Lots of smiles and good vibes, and the occasional hug. Excellent prices too. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"When I flew into Phoenix Sky Harbor recently for a three-day business trip, I decided to rent a car to avoid a constant diet of hotel buffet fare and venture out to find culinary adventures on my own that might help address my healthier way of eating. In that spirit, I drove to this compact Ethiopian spot on East McDowell Road, which not being too familiar with Phoenix, definitely felt like a sea of nightclubs, taquerias, and beauty parlors. After finding a parking space off an alleyway in the back (not my smartest move), I saw the brightly colored space with Ethiopia's national colors (photo: http://bit.ly/2I35PYC).  I entered past the foreboding wrought-iron door (photo: http://bit.ly/2oL0htS) and found it was a tiny green spot with Nelson Mandela watching me, a bit cramped with four little tables inside and two outside in their mini-terrace on the sidewalk (photo: http://bit.ly/2FZXd4E). Their placemat menu centered around the combo sampler plates, so I selected the $11.99 Veggie Combo which consisted of four sides of my own choosing, a jalapeño pepper pickled and stuffed with chopped red onions and tomato, and of course, the spongey injera not only at the bottom of the plate but also rolled up in a separate basket (photo: http://bit.ly/2FWzItc). I tried to resist nibbling on it mindlessly.  The challenge was that it was baked with authentic authority and tasted ideal with the food being served. For my sides, I selected the Gomen (Braised Collard Greens), the Tikl Gomen (Cabbage & Carrots), the Misr Wat (Red Lentil Stew), and Shiro Wat (Peas Sauce) (photo: http://bit.ly/2FvnJEW). I'm not sure how low-calorie any of it was, but it was all packed with savory flavor and a surprising freshness given how long they were warming in the pots in back. The friendly owner told me that he and his wife moved from Ethiopia pretty recently and dreamed of opening this business for a long time. I could tell by the quality of the food and positive attitude. Now back to that alleyway.  FOOD - 5 stars...authentic Ethiopian flavors well executed with fresh, organic ingredients AMBIANCE - 3 stars...don't come with a crowd unless you plan to eat in your car in that alleyway SERVICE - 4.5 stars...very friendly and solicitous TOTAL - 5 stars...great flavors in an unlikely part of town"}
{"text":"At least I was able to try this place.  They closed at 7:30 pm on Sat. They had 3-4 veg options for us.  The mizir wat, doro wat and foslia were all great, served with the obligatory angera and a surprise, jalapenos stuffed with a tomato onion mix.  The flavors were bold and spicy, this is not for people with weak pallets, but for ones that crave strong adventures.  For two of us it was $10, so its a bargain.  My few issues were, the ambiance, There are just three tables, large enough for 2-3 people each. some unused coolers along the walls and it was a tad warm inside. (so consider a to go order)  Also the hours I would love to pick up lunch here on a weekday, if only they had some food ready closer to noon.  Next time you want to impress a few guests with some bold exotic tastes get a to go order from here!"}
{"text":"First time trying this place!  They were starting to close up when I arrived, and had run out of some items, but still made up a sampler plate to go from the items they had left.  The owner was very nice!  Everything was delicious: favorites were the beets/potatoes, split peas, and green beans."}
{"text":"Best Ethiopian place in Arizona!! Reasonably priced for the amount of food you get!! Being Ethiopian myself and knowing how home cooked meals should taste this place has my vote!! Very authentic and Friendly owners!!"}
{"text":"I always make sure to bring my friends from out of town & locals to this little spot! I love introducing Ethiopian cuisine to my friends who have never had it. I'm from the Bay Area. I have had quite a difficult time adjusting to Phoenix's lack of diversity for dining options, so this place is a treat for me! The owner is very friendly and is ran by the most adorable family.  I have never had a bad dining experience here. I usually get the meat and veggie combo which includes two meat and two vegetarian sides served on a huge injera platter served family style. The combo is huge and is enough to feed two people or one really hungry person for just $9.99  seriously. Not even kidding...legit the best place to have a cute foodie date."}
{"text":"Wow. I've never tried Ethiopian food before and this place is right near I work. Trying Ethiopian food has always been on my bucket list so I took the plunge and tried it. My friend and I split the Meat and Veggie platter and an order of lentil Sambusas. It was excellent. Everything was very interesting, very tasty and spiced in a unique way. The gentleman that was working (who I am assuming is the owner) was very kind and helpful as far as assisting me with what to order and what to try. There was nothing I didn't enjoy. However, I would say that if you are in a hurry or want to eat quickly, put your order in online and pick it up to carry out or eat there. I am only afforded 30 minutes for lunch and it took about 45 minutes to order and get out food. But would absolutely go back again and refer to a friend. Another gentleman that was waiting for his food said that this place comes *highly* recommended if you are looking for Ethiopian food and I would agree."}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight and it was great! My fiancé and I had no idea what we liked so the (incredibly kind) man at the counter helped us decide. The food was deeeeeeelicious. They were out of meat dishes so he proceeded to sauté some for us on the spot. The split peas were my favorite. Our serving was huge; way more than enough for two people at a great price. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The hype for this place is definitely lived up to! Don't let the location of this place fool you, this is the closest thing you will get to authentic Ethiopian food in the valley. I would recommend ordering to go due to the face that the place is very VERY small and not meant to be for eating in, in the first place. The person who served us who I taken to be the owner was very friendly and helpful. The price is very cheap for the big amount of food you get. I will be back whenever I happen to be in this area!"}
{"text":"Don't let the parking stir you away from this spot. I was visiting town for a couple of days on the 4th of July. It seemed that every single place to eat was closed.  My favorite Ethiopian spot at home will take me 25+ minutes to get to, so I was stoked to see that this place was less than 5 minutes down from where I was staying. I was a little uneasy by the sketch seeming parking, so I decided on take out.  I squeezed my way through the entrance to find a quaint little spot. The man working there was nothing by helpful. He assured me that they didn't cook the vegetarian options in butter, making it VEGAN FRIENDLY.  We talked a bit and I felt very comfortable. In 10 minutes I had my food, and I left assuring the man that I'd be back. He was nothing but grateful as I was to him. With my two day stay in Phoenix, I made sure to visit here twice. The food was great and comparable if not better than my favorite joint at home in some regards.  No need to break the bank for some amazing Ethiopian food and friendly service here."}
{"text":"Some of the BEST ethopian food I have had EVER. Very tasty, perfectly seasoned, perfect portion size. We had a meat/veggie combo, enough for two. Definitely worth a journey to this little gem of a restaurant. A husband wife team run this establishment. They keep it simple and do it WELL."}
{"text":"I drive from Surprise for this place. Tiny, non-descript location in a not-so-great part of town. BUT! The food. The owner. The food! I've taken my husband, grandfather, and mother here, none of which had ever known Ethiopian was its own cuisine. They do now, and they loved every bite. The platters are the best way to get the most dishes for the cheapest. $14 easily feeds 2-3 people. It is fresh and flavorful. The owner is super nice and helpful to newcomers. I'm so happy that his business has been a success, and it sounds like it's only going to keep growing. He is passionate about what he does and he puts his heart into his food. He mentioned last week that he'd soon be featured on Check Please! So visit while you still can before the hordes come rolling in!!!"}
{"text":"Quaint, authentic and family run Ethiopian joint.  Food was excellent and chocked full of spice - it's a party in your mouth, be prepared for a slow burn but it's not too overwhelming.  We went with tartar and spicy beef stew.  Despite the name, the former packed more spice than the latter.  Try the tartar if you are feeling adventurous - owner was friendly and chatty; he let us try it rare first (as its meant to be) to see if we'd like it.  I actually thought it tasted better, but the portions are quite large so we had him bring it up to medium anyways because that's what mom always taught us to do :)  We had plenty of leftovers, so will probably sauté them with some potato for dinner tonight - might be sacrilege but I bet it tastes great!  All dishes came with generous portions of a spongy bread unique to Ethiopia.  It's way more filling than it looks so be parsimonious with how much you grab.  All in all a great meal, we'd like to go back and try the chicken...and next time I'll balance the meal out with a vegetable or two versus going all meat."}
{"text":"Sat here for 20 minutes. Man working at the front was sitting down with his girlfriend eating. Failed to greet me and then the cook walked past me twice failed to greet me and nobody tried to take my order."}
{"text":"Ordered through Eat24 delivery a while ago and I think I'm in love! The injera bread is deliciously spongy and a perfect accompaniment for the vegetarian combo (my fave is the cabbage). I also tried all of the types of sambusa and they are all delicious (although my favorite was the beef, I loved each of them for their own merits). Looking forward to trying more dishes. YUM!"}
{"text":"Ordered through Eat24 for lunch with a 45-60 minute wait time. After 60 minutes, my order was confirmed as having been delivered, but it was nowhere to be found. After 1 hr 25 minutes, it finally arrived. Stone cold and the order was wrong. Nuked some of it, but it was soggy reheated. Good potential, terrible execution. I'm sorry I ordered and even sorrier that I tipped ahead of time.  Edit: ok, now that I'm not hangry, I'm giving them an additional star. If this had been in the restaurant instead of delivery, it would have been very delicious. I really did appreciate how well spiced everything was. The injera was authentic, sour, and made from teff instead of cheap substitute grains. I'm not even a vegetarian and the split peas were my favorite out of the three dishes I tried. Even room temperature, they tasted good."}
{"text":"I have been interested in trying Ethiopian food for awhile and by whim, came across this restaurant and decided to give it a try. And I have to say, this restaurant made me love Ethiopian food. We ordered a vegetable sampler with chickpea sauce, split lentils, cabbage, and collard greens. The food was so delicious! Everything we ordered was amazing, however, I think the split lentils were my favorite. The flavor was beyond what I have ever tried and was so good. I am a vegan and the options here were great. Two of us split the sample and it was a perfect amount of food, and I typically eat a lot of food. The prices were also unbeatable. The owner of the restaurant was so helpful when ordering and very informative about the culture and eating habits. I 100% recommend this restaurant and I will definitely return or order for delivery. This is a small gem of Downtown Phoenix and is a definite go-to place!"}
{"text":"Place is, literally, a little hole in the wall. Was skeptical but LLLLOOOOVVVVEEEEDDDD the food and service. My husband and I were here for a convention and decided we wanted to eat elsewhere. Both of us was craving Ethiopian food. Found this place, the people there were nice, food was the BEST so far. I'd come again the next time I visit AZ."}
{"text":"Best ethiopian restaurant near Phoenix that we have tried so far. The place is small and a bit difficult to find out. But it is a hidden gem. The food is so flavorful and fresh. The owner is very welcoming and friendly. On talking with him we came to understand that they make food with their hearts and it is indeed reflected in the dishes. Keep on going and we wish all their dreams come true. All the best guys."}
{"text":"The owner is wonderful and his food is my favorite Ethiopian food in Arizona so far.  Very reasonably priced.   Definitely give this place a visit! Small and cozy; amazing food! My husband and I are addicted!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat! They have good options for vegetarians. Out of all the Ethiopian places I've tried this is the best one."}
{"text":"Another fantastic meal today, I love this place, genuine Ethiopian food cooked by Ethiopians."}
{"text":"Great food! It is more of a call in for pick up or delivery as the place it's very small. My group and i really did not mind at all having to sit in such a small place because the owner is so friendly.  Another thing to keep in mind is to order ahead of time - i mean call way ahead. The food is made fresh so it does take a while.  Also, the business is booming and they were not expecting things to go so well.  I love this place."}
{"text":"Chickpeas, misir wat, lentils, collards, and stuffed jalapeños plate is pictured.  More than enough food for two.  The food is delicious, and reasonably priced.  Always leave happy, and full!  It is slower service, so if you want fast food call your order in.  FYI If your not a AZ native, It gets super hot in the summer months inside this restaurant so you may want to call your order in for take out.  If you haven't had the pleasure of trying this quant lil spot, ya should!"}
{"text":"Looking for a good Ethiopia food experience while in Phoenix we decided to walk the two miles from downtown to Authentic Ethio. When we arrived we second guessed ourselves. The restaurant was a lot smaller then expected with a few indoor tables and some outdoor. But we stayed and asked for a menu. The owner asked us what we liked as there was no menu. We express a desire for mostly veg and some chicken. Well it was a wonderful experience. We we brought the most delicious food included some home made cheese, lentils, cabbage, collared greens and other melt in your mouth traditional foods. Definitely worth the walk and would highly recommend. As always with most the cost was very low and the value high. If in the Phoenix area this is a must stop if you love Ethiopian food."}
{"text":"Tiny place with big taste.  Everything is made from scratch.  You can park behind the restaurant and walk through the kitchen."}
{"text":"What a find! We ordered delivery last week and for the first time had authentic Ethiopian food. We had spicy beef stew and veggie sampler. It was so delicious that we went to the restaurant. Great service and terrific food!! I am now a big fan!!"}
{"text":"I don't know why I have neglected to try this place for so long! I love vegan Ethiopian food and this restaurant's offerings are outstanding and very reasonably priced.   We ordered a two item platter of string beans and the beet/potatoes and a three item of the red lentils, cabbage and chick pea sauce.   Highlights: The injera was thick and fresh. The lentils had a solid kick of spice but not overwhelmingly so. The cabbage wasn't greasy like it can be sometimes, and had a nice light flavor. The chick peas were full of flavor and very creamy.  The vegetables were prepared simply, with very little seasoning and very little salt.  The restaurant seating area is tiny, but there is enough room to eat comfortably. The decor is clean and modern, with great artwork.  We will definitely be back. The food was wonderful and it's always nice to pay a visit to Phoenix's historic Miracle Mile shopping district!"}
{"text":"I had lunch with my friend at this place today and the food was so delicious! The lady with short hair was the one served us, she was so nice! We had veggie & meat combo, mmm it was yummy! I will definitely go back there. PS: They make their own fresh injera."}
{"text":"I ordered from here using uber eats because it has such a large variety for vegetarians, and I was so pleasantly surprised! The sampler is pretty big, and I'm eating leftovers for breakfast as I type. :) I am looking forward to visiting the actual location since all of the other reviews cite how friendly the owners are.   I got the sampler with chickpeas, lentils, string beans, and beets. I loved them all! I liked the lentils a little better than the chickpeas, but I would still choose to eat them any day of the week. Also, who needs utensils when you have injera? If you've never had it, it's a flat bread made from teff, a naturally gluten free grain. If you have any real issues with gluten, you should still order the \"pure injera\" which looks to be made only with teff, so I assume their normal injera may have some wheat or something. Anyway, it's delightfully spongy and sour like sourdough.   You should certainly check this spot out!"}
{"text":"Delivery? Ethiopian food delivery?? Ethiopian food delivery in *Phoenix*?!? It's true. And thank goodness.  Just ordered from these folks, and while I'm no expert in Ethiopian cuisine, it was really tasty. Got the veg and meet combo, and it arrived nice and warm with super fresh injera. Service was very friendly, too."}
{"text":"So delicious!! I've never tried Ethiopia food. This place was amazing the food texture was amazing."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! The food is delectable and the service is warm and welcoming. It's literally a hole-in-the-wall. All the tables seat 2. The smells make you hungry as soon as they start preparing your food and the anticipation is almost too much to handle. The prices are so low, I couldn't believe how little I paid!"}
{"text":"4.5/5  I haven't had Ethiopian food this delicious since I was in DC, where there is a large Ethiopian community which means the food there is GOOD! The restaurant is nondescript and easy to miss if you aren't looking for it. It's right next to Aqua night club and there's plenty of parking on the side and back.   The restaurant itself is super tiny and there is limited seating. There are a few more chairs outside on the front patio though so there's always the outdoor seating option if there are larger parties and it's nice enough outside. The person in charge here was super friendly and accommodating. He put together two tables for us with no problems (Most of the setup indoors is for 3 people).  The menu looked so good. The only time I've seen a menu with more esoteric, harder to find items is also when I was in DC. We asked if we would be able to do a combination platter but for 4 instead of 2. They were easily able to put a grand feast of a meal, filled with beef, chicken, green beans, potatoes and carrot, lentils, split peas, and more! There was plenty of injera to go with our platter. In a short amount of time our platter was empty and our bellies full.   Next time I want Ethiopian food this is definitely the place to go!"}
{"text":"I'm so amazed right now. Where has this place been hiding all my life?   I just found Authentic Ethio on Grubhub, and had to call to confirm that they delivered because I just didn't believe it! Haha. As a vegan with no car, you get pretty sick of the same two delivery options (zpizza or Siu Wok) month after month, so I was just ecstatic and in disbelief that authentic Ethiopian food was truly going to arrive at my door! The owner answered and was such a pleasant person to talk to. So helpful, informative, and genuinely sounded happy to be doing this. .  So...I pretty much wanted to try everything that I could get my gluttonous veggie hands on. I ordered a 3 side and 4 side combo to share with my boyfriend (who is quite the picky eater). The owner said it would be about $21 with the delivery fee, and I thought that was incredibly reasonable for the beast amount of food I ordered, lol.  He also informed me it would take about an hour, and I was more than happy to wait for this glorious bounty. He was at my door in almost exactly that time! I hand him my cash and he hands me the goods, and man, it had some girth too it. I knew I was getting bang for my buck. So, I get inside, open up the containers, and marvel at the beautiful feast I'm about to take part in.   IT WAS ALL SO VERY DELICIOUS! Each container was lined with injera bread, and then the separate dishes were placed in compartments on top of the bread. The split lentil and split peas were so freaking flavorful and the star and co-star of the meal. There was also a beet and potato dish, (I love beets, and they were cooked perfectly), a string bean dish (yummy with the lentils), a stewed cabbage side (was great for adding texture to every bite, plus I just like cabbage), and slow-cooked chopped collards (slightly bitter, but in that good way that collards are!). All of it just went so well together and now I'm obsessed and hope this place sticks around for the rest of my days on this earth!   Btw! My boyfriend, who is neither vegan, nor a connoisseur of other cultures foods, actually really enjoyed the split lentils and split peas with the injera bread and ate about half of the serving. That's really saying something because his diet consists of burgers, carne asada burritos, and jimmy john's ham and provolone subs. No joke. He rarely strays!  I will order here probably too often from this day forward. :)"}
{"text":"By far one of the better eateries in Phoenix. Flavorful!! Priced right. Excellent service."}
{"text":"Great experience! Excited to go back and try new items....  The service was amazing. This was truly A1"}
{"text":"A literal hole in the wall. I tried their veggie and two meat offerings. Food is authentic. You can tell the kitfo was made by hand and the spice was just right. There's not much else to say when they've got the spice game down and tastes like home cooking."}
{"text":"Awful! We went at 5pm on a Friday night. Tried to order a sampler platter with 2 meats and 2 veggies. She said that they only had ONE meat available to order out of the 8-10 listed on the menu. They were apparently out or hadn't cooked anything else. We promptly left."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Ethiopian food resturant in Phoenix and I have eaten at all of them.  If  you don't mind cramped dives then you are sure to love it as well.  I wish I could eat the vegetarian combination platter every other day.  At $12 for two people- it is in the realm of possibilities.  Finish your meal off with a spicy pepper stuffed with pico de gallo.  Delicious."}
{"text":"All I have to say is scrumptious delicious Authentic Ethiopian food.  I'm Ethiopian who moved from DC so I know what I'm talking about this is the real deal. The only thing I'd say to the owner is set up a clean bathroom & improve the interior design."}
{"text":"Phx, i'm impressed. As a Phx raised Ethiopian American, I can attest to the foods superior quality esp to that of its neighboring ethio eateries. The area is great for strolls- if you like the \"up and coming\" city feel. Peep the wall art adjacent to AEthio!   AEthio catered my cousins wedding to much praise. The food was fantastic; flavorful and FRESH. More importantly the business owners conducted themselves professionally. For the client service touch, they came over a day in advance to introduce themselves. I'm not sure about their prices but if my family didn't complain, it was favorable.   Space: Urban charm galore! Situated on a busy main street, cloistered by a bookshop and garage. While the interior has some Ethiopian decor, the true delight is the mural of Emperor Haile Selassie outside.  The restaurant functions for a \"To-Go\" spot as evidenced by the limited seating. I read some reviews about wrong orders- and to play interlocutor; this is most likely light cultural misunderstanding. As a paying client you have the right to your full order. However please be mindful that this is a small business run by 1st gen Americans and that what seems obvious to you may not be to them. Vocalize your issues."}
{"text":"This place is delish and the portion sizes are huge. I've been to plenty of Ethiopian restaurants the metro area  and this one has them beat! The injera is fresh and all of their dishes are perfectly seasoned. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I would pass and see this little place just West of 18th Street on McDowell and think I need to try this place.  Well I did and I'll be back.  A coworker and I had talked about taking on doing Ethiopian and today was the day. Calling ahead to check hours they let me know they were open until 8.  Showing up at 7, I had 10 min before my coworker was to arrive. There are 2 small tables with 3 chairs each. A large drink cooler on one wall filled with a selection of sodas, juices and a set of store shelves with containers of beans and spices that separates the dining area from the kitchen.  Greeted warmly by the owner/chef, he proudly let me into the plans for this little restaurant and a tour of the clean and spacious kitchen, fresh bread stacked near the oven and fresh injera in a container on a shelf.  He painted a colorful picture of the restaurant's future patio and Ethiopian coffee ceremonies; roasting beans fresh in front of guests and preparing a clay pot full of rich strong coffee served in  demitasse sized cups.  He asked if we would be doing meat or veggie/vegan. My coworker is vegetarian and he said, \"I got you covered,\" and turned to the kitchen to begin preparation.  My coworker arrived and I let her know he was putting together a vegetarian platter. We sat and chatted as dishes clattered in the kitchen.   A platter arrived with 4 colorful dishes served on injera with a piece of rolled injera on each side.  We dug in, right hands, no silverware, as is traditional.    We were not able to finish, the dish between the 2 of us so we packed the rest to go.  All that was only $10.  While parking is a little challenging the best place is in a parking lot on the west side of the complex.   If you blink you can miss the place. As you head east on McDowell as soon as you get to the artistic arch across McDowell slow, look north for the parking lot. If you pass the car wash and 18th Street you went too far.  Now go check it out!!!"}
{"text":"I love Ethiopian cuisine, and I especially love that they have so many vegan dishes. That being said, it pains me to have to rate this establishment as sub-par. It may have just been an off day.   I arrived around 11:30am. We were the only ones there.  I ordered a vegan plate. I was advised I could choose 4 sides, so I chose Misir Wat, Tikel Gomen, Gomen, & Shiro (sp?). My lunch companion is a meat eater; she requested Doro Wat, but was advised they didn't have that today. So, make that 2 vegan plates. No problem.   40 min later our food comes out. I'm very patient, so I wasn't too bothered or upset by this. Then I tried to pay. \"No cash?\" she asked, as I stand with my credit card in hand. I simply replied, \"No.\" She said that she didn't have the password. I didn't even ask why a password was needed to swipe my card. She called somebody, then informed me that he was on his way. Who? The password?? So we sit...   A man arrived @ 15-20 min later, apologizing profusely. As he processed the charge ($20; $10 per plate), he chatted me up. He asked if it was our first time, and inquired how we heard about them. I answered accordingly. He then requested I rate them highly. Enter my side eye. I was ok with the hour it took to get and subsequently pay for our meal. But when you attempt to solicit unwarranted praise for subpar service, you've now picked my pickle, mister. You didn't even offer me a discount for the inconvenience.   The food: misir wat & gomen were good, but I've had much better misir wat.  Tikel gomen was undercooked. My cabbage was almost crunchy Shiro (sp?) was ok.   The portions of veggies were very small. And I eat small portions. There was a ton of injera bread though. Pity, because it went to waste.   Again, maybe it was an off day, but I don't plan on returning to find out."}
{"text":"As authentic as it gets for Ethiopian food here in the valley.  My fiance first took me here a couple of months back (and she is from Ehiopia) and she is even wowed by the presentation and quality of food at this joint.  And it is located in the heart of Central Phoenix, when you are in the area, go here and bring a friend!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing for people who love very tasty spicy foods. It has lots of vegan and gluten free options too and a variety of foods you can eat their or take away. The owners are also very friendly and welcoming and explain about their cuisine and how to eat it. Just an amazing Ethiopian restaurant!"}
{"text":"We had Veg and Veg/Meat combo, all of the dishes were good. The spicy chicken had a moderate degree of heat, which was delicious. Very small restaurant, with the owners making everything by hand. Glad we went."}
