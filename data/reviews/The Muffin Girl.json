{"text":"These Muffins are the die for! You can't go wrong with any of them.  Fresh and so full of flavor.  This Muffin Girl has found her niche in the muffin world in Arizona.  Go get yours right now! And the owner is so very delightful."}
{"text":"The Muffin Girl is an absolute gem.  I ordered several flavors to find them all delicious.  My favorite flavor is split between the Orange Cranberry and the Lemon Poppy seed they are both so good.  The muffins are warm, soft, and bursting with flavor.  The cups are a grand idea they allow for easy consumption and no messy crumbs.  The shop is vibrantly inviting while being cute at the same time.  The staff are friendly ready to greet each visitor.  I will most assuredly be returning in the future to get more muffins.  I would urge you to give them a try as well, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The Muffin Girl shop was absolutely wonderful for delivering muffins for my friend's birthday. I ordered 6 muffins through Uber Eats and added a request that they include a note with a short birthday message to my friend. I received a text regarding my order and Taryn offered to throw in tissue paper, a little birthday card and a candle for my delivery. It was above and beyond and made it extra special for my friend. I'm looking forward to ordering again and will bring my family in for a visit to try them myself!"}
{"text":"Yummy! There's different flavors! And I love that the ingredients are right under the muffin name for those people that need it. I also love the pay it forward for the military, cops and firefighters and other important people I missed :)"}
{"text":"We were excited to find this little muffin shop in the heart of Mesa! The Muffin Girl offers 18 flavors of muffins ranging from popular picks like Blueberry & Chocolate Chip, to unique ones like Banana Split & Pineapple Right Side Up. We had the pleasure of meeting Taryn who is the owner & baker of these muffin creations! She went over their flavors and explained what was in each one as we made our decision.

After much debate, we ended up getting the Orange Cranberry (orange muffin with cranberry swirls & a glaze on top) and the Almond Knickers (almond muffin with chocolate chips & a almond topping). The texture of the muffins was super soft and fluffy. I personally preferred the Almond due to bits of chocolate throughout, only wished it had a bit more of an almond flavor however, but my fiancé like the Orange more because it was a little bit less sweet.

While the price of the muffins is a bit high if purchasing only one or two, the pack of six is much more affordable and rounds up to about $2.70 per muffin. The muffins are sold warmed up or frozen so it would be easy to take a few home! We'll definitely be back to try some of the other flavors!"}
{"text":"To be honest, I am not really a muffin person. Why? Because they're either too dry, too bland or too oily. That's not the case here! EVERY muffin I've had was not the least but dry, nor are they oozing with fat.

There is so much to choose from, it can be hard to make a decision, but I'm a simple person and my personal favorites are the Raspberry and the Carrot Cake. My boyfriend really enjoys the Almond Knickers, which is a chocolate chip muffin topped with toasted almonds and a sweet glaze. My kids loved the Red Velvet and the Smore's (which I managed to sneak a taste of and it was soooo good). 

To top it off, the muffins come in these cute pink and white striped cups and are served warm by the friendly staff. They've definitely changed my mind about muffins!"}
{"text":"I used to only have eyes for cupcakes but the muffin girl has caused me to switch to team muffin! I never realized how delectable a muffin could be until I tasted these. Every flavor I've had is awesome, I think I've worked my way through 5 of them: smores, coffee cake, raspberry, classic blueberry and peanut butter chocolate chip. I definitely plan on making my way through all the fun flavors... :)"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this muffin shop through Uber Eats and all I can say is WOW. Not only are these muffins amazing, but the owner is an absolute doll...... INCREDIBLY sweet and very professional. She's all about making sure her customers are satisfied & happy. I'll be sure to recommend this shop to all my friends. Little does she know, I'm a Navy vet, affiliated with many veteran organizations within the East Valley and will be passing the good word onto many more people!

{"text":"I'm all about supporting small local businesses especially women entrepreneurs, so I had to try this place.  The Muffin Girl just added a ton of new flavors, so I will have come back to try more of the muffins! So far I've only tried six different flavors but will update this review when I've tried more.  They are close to the light rail, so it's perfect if you don't have a car. 
The store is just a few blocks from my house, so it's a great stop for a quick muffin fix when I go bike riding. I just wished they served coffee. Empower women businesses and try this place! 
Female entrepreneurs see the world through a different lens and, in turn, do things differently, The owner uses good packaging, so if you are throwing a party or even going to an office gathering. The place is excellent for picking up a 12 pack! The muffins are individually packaged in small cute containers to prevent them from getting damaged, and go in a colored pastel bag for easy transporting.

{"text":"Best muffins I've ever had!!!  The owner is amazingly nice and knowledgeable! They are located in a little plaza on country club. It's a cute little muffin shop! I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I wish this little gem was closer to my house!

We were meeting friends at the Colombian restaurant next door and wandered into the Muffin Girl.

It's basically a storefront with a display case which has just a sample of the many flavors you can choose from. 

The owner was really nice and explained how you can buy them warm or frozen. 

We opted frozen since we had a long drive home. In about 30 seconds or so, a perfect muffin! I had a mint chocolate chip and it's heavenly.

I Love supporting small businesses like this. Take a drive and check it out!"}
{"text":"Tried the peanut butter chocolate chip and bananas foster. Soooooo delicious and especially good when warm! I like that they also sell them frozen too."}
{"text":"These muffins are AMAZING!
We first met The Muffin Girl at the Gilbert Farmer's Market. We purchased a muffin from her, and it was love at first bite! Every week when we went back to the Farmer's Market we would stop by The Muffin Girl to try something new. We were ecstatic when we heard she was opening a store front! 
The muffins are the best ever! The flavors are spot on. The are moist and flavorful. You can't go wrong with any flavor. I have tried most all of her muffins and I have to say my favorites are cinnamon roll, peanut butter chocolate chip and banana split. When you order a muffin they serve it to you warm which makes it even better. We end up buying the six pack because it is the best deal, and these muffins are so good we all want our own! 
The store is adorable. When you walk in it puts a smile on your face. The staff are amazing! Taryn and her husband are the nicest people in the world. They make sure their customers feel appreciated. They were so patient when we showed up with our two crazy boys and newborn baby. You won't get better customer service anywhere else. 
Seriously go try The Muffin Girl.....you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is a great little bakery! The owners are amazing people with big hearts, let's not forget delicious muffins! I have watched the Muffin girl grow from farmers market to bakery and could not be happier about it! 19 flavors of muffins?! Yes thank you! I have tried all of them and have no complaints about any of them. I very much enjoy the pay it forward program they have started for the local fire and police. Tasty muffins and lovely people, what more could you ask for. What a great addition to Mesa."}
{"text":"Forget the cupcakes! These muffins are soooo much better. Here's a lil bit of history I gathered. The Muffin Girl, Taryn, started out in her own kitchen. One day the gal pulled out her bakebook in hopes of finding a yummy treat for a wedding shower she was prepping for. She tried 1,2,3 different recipes. None of them satisfying her taste buds so the girl ventured out and started to experiment, and voilá The Muffin Girls' bomb muffins were born! Months later she opens up her own lil shop in Mesa, AZ. 
Opening day I'm there. I tried the peanut butter chocolate chip muffin. Served to me warm, with a fork, napkin, and in a cup, smart move! I was surprised by how heavy the baked goodie felt in my hand. I knew then it was going to be ooey goodness. It did not disappoint! It was super moist and the chocolate chips were melted to perfection. It was so filling I was only able to eat half. Thank goodness for the cup and lid because I was able to save and eat later for after dinner dessert. The plan was for me to share with my son, but well uh that didn't happen. He's just gonna have to get his own. 
So needless to say, I will be back! Next time I will pick up a few more to share with friends and family (that's the plan, not a promise) if I can refrain myself from indulging. 
They sell individually or by the dozen. Hot, warm, room temp and/or even frozen! They are just starting up so no hot coffee yet, but it will be coming. Cold drinks offered as of now. Super excited to see this lil bakery grow. Super not excited about my running miles having to grow too. ;)"}
