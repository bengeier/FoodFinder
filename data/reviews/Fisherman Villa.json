{"text":"I only come here because it is cheap and there isn't usually a wait or a very short wait. There is a tea surcharge but still ends up being cheaper for the same amount of food as other places. 

The quality is fine..especially for the price. 

There are about 3 large tables for groups of 8 or more. Mostly tables for 4-6. Some tables of 2 along the wall. 

Lots of parking (the plaza is mostly empty)."}
{"text":"Came here for dim sum yesterday, Christmas Eve. The place was packed but the line up wasn't overly huge at 1pm. 

All I can say is the food looked and tasted \"bleh\"."}
{"text":"Anything shrimp dumplings. Taro bun and custard tarts are awesome.best place for serious dim sum. Nice atmosphere. Very busy."}
{"text":"Recommended by my coworker so I decided to try it out.  For my particular visit, I went for dim sum.  

Impression:
Its your typical chinese decor restaurant.  Not upscale and the furniture looks like any other chinese restaurant I go to.  I wonder if they all buy from the same furniture store!  However I have to point out that the chairs were uncomfortable to me. The backrest felt it was too far back and it just didn't feel right to me.  
The place seats about 100 and the wait staff are in uniform. I didn't like how crowded the tables are next to each other.  I had to change chairs as the guy on the table next to me was uncomfortably close to me. 

Our order:
Steamed chicken feet in bbq sauce (a little on the sweet side but tasty)
Har gow (mushy inside and outside, not good)
Siu Mai (pork was decent but no crab eggs)
Sticky Rice (hard to go wrong)
Beef tripe (tad chewy but otherwise good)
Fried Taro dumpling (really good)

Dim sum here is non traditional style, meaning there are no push carts.  You order from the menu and its in both chinese and english.  Food came out quick and piping hot too.  Almost burnt my tongue out on the beef tripe as i was so hungry when it came out and dove right in before letting it cool off. 
The portions are a little smaller than most dim sums that I go to.  
Overall the dim sum food was decent but the one complaint i have is with the Siu Mai.  Real Siu Mai has crab eggs on top, and some places cheap out and substitute it with fish eggs but this place didn't have any eggs on it.  Thats a no no for me.  Never will i order the siu mai again.  

However the best thing about this place is the price.  I was floored when i got the bill as it came out to only $18 and that was with a pop!  Definitely one of the best bang for you buck dim sums I've ever tried and I'm definitely will be coming back here again."}
{"text":"This Hongkong Style Restaurant is better off operating in Hongkong Style business where they have hidden surprsing charges for the diners. Our bill came with an additional $5 \"COOKING CHARGE\" which our server did not inform us. All throughout the years, we have never been charged for cooking. Cheap Shot. They accepted their mistake of not informing us about it but would not reverse it. Okay so they paid $5 to lose a customer. There are other more honest restaurants. Another surprise charge is the tea charge per person which they also did not inform us. They should take their \"cheating\" ways back to Hongkong where it is a common practice."}
{"text":"What happened to this place?  We tried it a few monthes ago and the food was good.  We ate dim sum again today and it was really really bad.  

Stuff was missing, food was oily and recooked, or undercooked.  Beef ribs were just bone, fat and grisle. Even found paper towels in our food?!  Service was non-existent."}
{"text":"This late night restaurant is one of my favourite places to go for a nice family dinner. I don't think people give this place enough respect for its high quality food. My experiences with them have been very pleasant and they charge reasonably. We usually get what they have on special which is either Lobster or Roasted Squab both of which is amazing for special occasions."}
{"text":"Recently changed owners. Dim Sum is really good...you need to try the Sesame Chicken, it's sweet and yummy!"}
{"text":"Yes this is a cheap decent place for dim sum. But the food all tasted very bland and comes in a smaller portion compared to other restaurants(you get what you paid for I guess). Even their soy sauce were watered down. The only dishes we ordered that tasted ok were chicken feet and deep fried squid tentacles. This restaurant would be great for the ones who live in the area and would like a cheap meal, it is not the kind of place I would bring out of town friends to. 

We were seated at the table that's closest to the entrance. So the people who were waiting for their tables were watching us eat. Some of them were standing right behind my chair. The guy who takes number even put his note pad with numbers on our table a couple times(unrespectful as f) , some of the people who were waiting literally leaned over to our table to look at the notepad which was very rude. This plus the bland food made the whole experience not so enjoyable, I ended up going home hungry.


Food 3.5/5
Service 3.5/5
Environment 3/5

Will I come back? Ha, lets see."}
{"text":"Today was crazy good :  all seven dishes $3.08.  That's amazing deal 

1: 2x soup in pouch. Make sure u ask for ginger and vinegar on side to add. 

2: Har Gow.  Huge !!  Tons of shrimp. Noodle thin & lite. (I like to add Chili oil and kipchup? Sp?  (kinda an Asian Worcestershire, u have to ask for that) takes it to next level 

3: curry Cuttle fish. Tender steamed perfect 

4: sticky rice in lotus leaf. Wow!  Perfectly cooked  and hot. Came right off leaf with chop sticks. Just enough ground gooey pork and mushroom inside. 

5: deep fried bean curd w/meat. (Lol! The meat is shrimp.  U will love this. !  Cooked to order. Dip in Chinese vinegar. 

6: shrimp spring roll. Just what it's suppose to be.  Made just for u. Not greasy and hot. (Skip the sauce they give u with it not good). 

English not the best but friendly service. Free parking ! And wonderful Tea $.90 per person.  We go early 9:30am. It gets busy. And I find less attention to detail later in morning.  

$35 tax, tea & tip in."}
{"text":"Warning! Not for dim sum beginners. This place is cramped and noisy, however the food here is worth the price. My parents took me here and the total bill came out to $25 for 7 dishes. Some of my favourite dishes were the squid tentacles (better than others Ive tried), and the bean curd in oyster sauce. Their Siu mai is very good, but their hargow is pretty plain. The curry cuttlefish is satly so be forewarned. Other good dishes are the chicken feet and rice rolls. This is a family favourite, just because we are pretty used to the environment. If you can bypass the poor english, the cramped restaurant, and the noise, it can be a cheap delicious dim sum experience in scarborough."}
{"text":"All I can say is that this place needs a little updating.
The food is not bad there and if you are thinking of having dim sim during the weekend, be prepared for a little wait.."}
{"text":"This is the cheapest Dim Sum on my list of Go to dim sum places. If you are in the area and are looking for quick, quality, and cheap dim sum this is the place to go. I only ever come for the dim sum but there is usually always a line up that moves fairly quickly. The service is decent if you speak Mandarin or Cantonese and if you speak English it is still really good with \"thank you\" and \"hello.\"  

Come here for the dim sum and keep coming back for the cheap prices!"}
{"text":"I now know the decent overall rating this place received on yelp is due to it's affordability and not much anything else.  The wife and I checked out this place yesterday.  We ordered:  beef tendon, deep fried squid legs, shrimp chow fun, hotpot lapchong rice, preserved egg and pork congee and the lobster & chow mein special.  The total bill came out to $30 approx. (including taxes).  

If you know anything about dim sum, or chinese food, you would agree, this overall total is very very cheap for what we ordered.  

However, food to me, isn't about being just cheap.  If you are going to part ways with your hard earned dollar, make sure you get 'value' in return.  When it comes to food, the term 'value' includes the yummy-factor and not only the cost. 

The wife and I generally go for dim sum at Royal Tea House, Dragon Boat or Spring Villa.  Three of the top dim sum joints in Richmond Hill and Markham for the price.  Compared to the quality and amount of food we get at these three dim sum joints, Fisherman Villa is a grave disappointment.

Summary:
1.  Come here if - you are a starving student on a fixed income; or, if you know how to speak Cantonese and don't mind the rough service you get from some of the staff (a certain woman in particular).
2.  Don't come here if - you value taste, quality and portion size as being more important than saving $2-$3 per dish;  or, you want a clean, modern ambiance to eat and relax in

Final Words:
This place is a poor representation of dim sum in terms of quantity and quality of dishes served.  Of course it's cheap, they give you nothing.  The egg in the congee was diced so small it was probably 1/10 of the entire egg.  The XXL squid legs were so soggy and oily and without flavour - not to mention tiny in portion size;  I had to force myself to finish it on account of the fact there are starving children in North Korea....

FOODIES - do not come here.  Spend the extra $2-$3 more and go to Royal Tea House in Markham or Spring Villa on Woodbine/Steeles.  You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Our go-to-dim sum resto in Scarb. Seriously the cheapest and most decent dim sum places are in Scarb. You get your not so fancy Chinese restaurant at reasonable prices and the food is decent quality. This place goes by size for their pricing but is on the lower end compared to other places. I think $2.10 for a small, $2.40 for a medium and $2.70 for a large so you can easily get 10 dishes for 2 people for about $30 depending on what you order. I like how they don't have the pushing carts because the food is fresher and they come out all at once. Parking lot is always full since they share it with other restaurants/services so make sure you come earlier for lunch kr dinner."}
{"text":"The property itself feels a little run-down, much like many of the businesses in the area around it in general. The dim sum we had on this day was average-to-excellent. The braised chicken feet was the highlight: skin moist and off-the-bone soft. The dumplings, har gow & chiu chow fun gor, were also quite good. Best thing: no lineup to get in on a weekend. The dim sum pricing is fixed but very reasonable, so no need to camp out at the crack of dawn to get in before 11 am in order to save a few dollars like at other dim sum restaurants in the city."}
{"text":"The Chinese name makes it an indication that it has changed ownership as a previous review stated, however if you don't read Chinese then you would think nothing has changed since the English business name stays Fisherman Villa.  I've been here for Dim Sum during Summer and believe it was priced $1.80 during those special hours. It was A-OK however this review is about a Dinner Meal. 

Absolutely love that LCD overhead as we watched HK show while making our order. There are promotions, house special items on Menu  all of the typical Cantonese Cuisine.

Buddha Jumps Over Wall($13.99) -  Advertised as specialty item they're known for and it is for an individual portion. I haven't had this Cantonese delicacy for quite awhile now but from last I remembered, it is fine the way it is. 1 one-bite Abalone, sliver of Shark Fin, Shitake Mushroom, Silk Chicken, Dried Scallop and a few more items in Broth.

Crispy Pigeon($15.99) - Also on that same specialty advertisement. It was crispy like Peking Duck and the meat was marinaded to umami salty savouriness already that you don't need additional Salt/Pepper or Worcestershire Sauce dipping. Best part of course is always the HEAD/neck piece, very crunchy. 

Complimentary Soup appetizer and Red Bean Soup dessert is standard. Appetizer Soup refills are available upon request as the server asked us if we wish for more. Don't expect facial expressions but for some weird reason the service was nice this time.  Changed our plates, lots of Teapot refills.  Fisherman Villa is A-OK."}
{"text":"We came for dim sum on a Sunday with a group of 12. We had made reservations so our table was ready for us when we arrived. We ordered just over 40 dishes. You mark your selections on paper and hand to the wait staff and your order starts rolling out shortly. Decor is not great, but we come for the fresh and inexpensive food. Service was great despite the full house. Been here many times, and will be back for more!"}
{"text":"I've been here a gazillion times, not only because my mom works there, but also because the food is absolutely amazing. But if you're looking for a cheap restaurant, stay away! Haha. 
The service is okay, isn't fast but isn't slow. It all really depends on what time of night you go. 
But if it's slow, it's okay! You can enjoy a Chinese drama/show on the LCD TV there! 
I recommend the Sesame chicken/beef. SOO GOOD. It's amazing and my favourite dish there. 

So if you're looking for delicious chinese food at night, this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"???????????sheppard and midland??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Read as 3.5

Came here on a weekday morning and the service was extremely slow. Took almost 30 minutes from when we put in our dimsum orders to our first food. Service in general was also rather poor, we always had wait a while before getting any waiters' attention for refills/bill/etc.

Super cheap prices and even their \"tea\" price is very reasonable. The tea itself is rather poor quality and the water isn't that hot. The food itself is better than you'd expect, very, very warm and with our highlights being the tofu/vegetable rice noodle roll and the steamed tofu/shrimp dish. 

Definitely a good deal for the price you pay, but overall, service could be better!"}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to go to dim sum at this place a few days ago.  After hearing about it from a fellow yelper we ventured out on a weekday to get our dim sum on.  Located in Scarborough this is a decent (cheap!!!!!) place for trying out some dishes.

Now not sure if it was due to the holidays that it was super busy on a Wednesday morning, but it was packed!  

There certainly isn't anything fancy up in here - in fact the tablecloths are just ragged cutup pieces of white fabric.  

But you aren't coming here for the decor...nor the service (don't expect much in that department either and you'll be fine).  You come here for the food which is pretty good but tastes fabulous when you realize the prices!

We ordered the deep fried korean short ribs, har gow, soup dumplings, lotus leaf/rice wrap and squid tentacles. It all came to under $20 for 2 people!  Now that's how I like to roll - full and cheap!! 

This place definitely gets crowded on the weekends - and there really isn't any waiting room inside - you're literally standing in a diner's lap.

If you can let go of the decor and any idea of good service than this a great dim sum option east side.  If you are trying to impress someone I would skip this place but if you just want to eat and have a fat belly and a fat wallet then definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"Cheapest place I know for dim sum and tastes great too. Typical dim sum place. Busy on weekends during noon and you got to wait by the door for a table. You order from sheet so no carts being pushed around. I would recommend their Deep fried taro ball and theor steamed taro cake. You can order the usual dim sum menu har gow,  Sui Mai,  shrimp noodle roll,  and even chicken feet which is pretty tasty despite its appearance. If you are feeling more hungry order their shredded pork and golden preserved egg congee. Do good.  Or you can order some beef ho fun. Fried rice noodles a staple in canto cuisine."}
{"text":"This place is very good for Dim Sum ! Fair price and good quality food. Decor is not fancy but pretty clean comparable to many not expensive Chinese places. Was very surprised for quality of Xiao Long Bao, very thin skin and a lot of soup. My favorite dishes Har Go, Shu Mai, Tendon, Taro dumplings and probably about 20 more :))) Like this place and very recommend it."}
{"text":"The best dim sum in the city!  Can't say much more because it's packed enough;). Food is made fresh to table,  my mouth is watering just thinking about it right now!"}
{"text":"Having dinner at 8.30PM and when we came in was greet in cantonese language eventhough i told the waiter i need 2+1infant in english, The waiter keep trying to communicate in cantonese/mandarin when i told him in english i need high chair and he keep saying something in cantonese(make me wanna scream\"Hello, i dont speak cantonese\"). I would say that the price wasn't cheap but the portion is generous (9.99-12.99/item).the sesame chicken was too sweet for our taste ( if i say it's too sweet means like i'm getting diabetes sweet), The pork chop with garlic sauce was delicious and groupa fish with seasonal vege wasn't really good. I don't know whether i'm out of luck(2 out of 3) or my taste bud going crazy but i also overheard other guest (i think he is a regular guest coz he call the waiter by name and every staff seems to know him) complain about the food was undercook so out of luck getting amateur chef?"}
{"text":"Food 3 stars.  Overall 3.5 stars.

I am quite happy with a dining experience at Fisherman Villa Restaurant. 

We dined at Fisherman Villa on a weekday evening.  The restaurant was not busy, with only a few tables of customers.  We were greeted, seated and served with tea promptly.  We ordered a steamed bass fish dish (1.5lb at $19/lb) and a chicken with vegetable dish ($11.50).  The chicken was quite good: good flavour, beautifully plated, well portioned.  The steamed fish was made from a live fish (many restaurants would steam a fresh dead fish).  It was over cooked.  I still found it enjoyable because the sauce was delicious.  

The services was wonderful: Servers were *extremely* friendly and chatty.  There were free starter soup and dessert.  Used plates were promptly replaced.  Tea pot was promptly refilled.    

Fisherman Villa is a neighourhood restaurant that is suitable for regular family dining out.  Pricing appears to be lower than other restaurants of similar class (mid-range).  I would likely return because the overall offerings (selections, food, services, prices, location) are suitable for our family."}
{"text":"I was here with my bf and family for Chinese New Years Day.  Last time I have been to this restaurant was a few decades ago when I was a kid.  I remember Dragon Centre next door was where I got my first Nintendo NES system, and the rat running around in the restaurant inside which I thought was very cute but my mom was screaming in horror.

On this Chinese New Years Day, they only had a small menu to choose from with patrons filling up the restaurant towards later in the evening.  The entire menu was in Chinese, not sure if there was an English menu had we asked for one.  We picked the $98 meal for 4 persons : includes lobster, scallop and fish, chicken, vegetables, and soup/dessert.

The food here was ok, however the lobster was not fresh and meat was tough.  For $130 tips/tax included I felt it was a bit overpriced for the food we had.  We were still not full after the meal."}
{"text":"+.5 for service

Believe it or not, I actually think this place is quite underrated. Definitely one of the better Chinese restaurants in Scarborough, especially for the price you pay. I was somewhat of a regular here back when I still lived in Toronto, and came back here when I revisited here for the holidays.

Fisherman Villa is located east of Midland, just north of Sheppard on Glen Watford Drive. It's hard to miss as the restaurant is quite big, although from the outside it looks like it could have a makeover or two.

Most of the menu is in Chinese, so if you're Chinese illiterate you would be better dining with someone who can read the language. My family ordered a chicken shark fin soup, sesame chicken, peking duck, and mixed veggies. Everything combined was only $90; an extremely cheap price for the quality you get.

I highly recommend the sesame chicken here, it's crispy and sweet at the same time, and the chicken pieces were actually quite good in quality. The peking duck is also one of the better ones you can get in Scarborough, although the pancakes used to roll the fillings here would get quite hard if you don't eat them immediately. The shark fin soup is above average for the price you pay, but I've had better in other restaurants. Finally I found the mixed veggies to be decent, again very good value for the price you pay.

Service was very good the entire time. I haven't been here for dim sum so I can't vouch for that, but I can definitely vouch for dinner in here."}
{"text":"Little dingy, food is pretty good,  ha gow skins lacked the delicateness and finesse of the higher end dim sum places. Soup dumplings were not very soupy,  they were fair. Deep fried taro dumplings were pretty good,  actually enjoyed those,  who am I kidding, everyone likes fried stuff. Overall,  I give three stars, flavour is decent,  prices are cheap and, the tea is good, as it should be with dim sum. Oh,  the egg tarts,  those are good,  give them a go,  proverbial afterthought."}
{"text":"First time I've tried eel done two ways and it was definitely memorable - 1) fried and seasoned like calamari and 2) steamed with a black bean sauce - both delicious and I wish I had a bigger stomach that day.  All the vegetable dishes and the soup were also really good."}
{"text":"Monday - Friday all dishes at $2.08 & special dishes at $2.38!

You order and they steam the food for you so it's fresh.  Pretty tasty food at very reasonable price. Service can be a bit sloppy but can't ask too much for this price.

Cleanliness is average."}
{"text":"Come early and make sure to call in ahead for reservations. It is always packed and with long line ups. Place is decorated like any Chinese restaurant but you will notice the little space filled with tables very closed to each other. 

This is my second time here and both times I had good experiences. This time we had dimsum. Price is ok, good quality food that tastes great, service is good considered how busy the place is.

We had the usual dimsum, siomai, hargaw, rice noodle rolls and many more. We also had xiao long bao(tiny soup filled buns) and fried sticky rice which you normally don't see in dimsum menus. Everything tasted fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst service I have ever received in a restaurant. They messed up my order and did not even apologize. Instead, they just gave us some b.s. that we ordered incorrectly. We talked to the waiter and then the manager and after a tough debate they decided to cancel our order. Never coming back again. You can keep your rude staff and see how that goes."}
{"text":"I've only ever come here for dim sum, and the food has been decent. 
Service is terrible, but prices are good. Value restaurant for sure."}
{"text":"If you get past the decor this place is pretty good! The staff and owner are all very nice and accommodating. I come here with my extended family occasionally and we always enjoy ourselves. I haven't tried the dim sum before but supper 'hits the spot' as others have said. They will make whatever you want even if it's not in the menu, just give them a heads up that your coming and tell them what you want to eat. The owner Bill is a great guy and works very hard. His staff are equally fantastic and provide service that you just done see anymore. Unfortunately there's too many dishes to comment on so just look at the pictures and go give it a try!"}
{"text":"This is my main go-to place for dim sum. My favourites are their char siu bao (soft bun, ample char siu), beef short ribs, and black sesame mochi. However, all the other dim sum I've tried here is also of excellent quality. It's always crowded at lunch hour which can be a testament so how good the food is. The staff are also very friendly. The only thing I don't like about this place is that the decor is rather shabby and old and could use a spruce-up."}
{"text":"Tldr: good quality dim sum at competitive prices, service is ok, would recommend 

Come here often with my family for the weekly Saturday dim sum adventures. This place is great for quality dim sum at a decent price. I love how this place let's you mark what you want on a menu sheet, so you don't have to wait 10 years for your favorite dim sum dish to roll by in a cart. They have all the dim sum staples, and while it doesn't seem like they have one dish in particular that's better than other places, each dish is quite tasty and delicious. 

Service is alright, and this place gets real busy so come earlier in the day if you don't want to wait that long. Their dim sum hours are 8:30am - 4pm. After 4, they serve restaurant quality Chinese food. Haven't eaten here for dinner as I've only came here for the dim sum. 

The prices for dim sum are pretty good. Each dish is divided into \"sizes\". Prices are as followed: Mon-Fri: $2.38 (S, M, L). $2.68 (special dim sum dishes). $2.98 (XXL). For weekends and holidays, it's +20cents (for S/M/L/special) and +30 cents (for XXL) on top of the mon-fri price for each dish. 

Overall, it's a solid place for that dim sum fix. My family keeps coming back for good reason. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a hidden gem in Scarborough.  While the decor is kind of dated, food is great.  Authentic and reasonably priced Cantonese food.  I agree with other yelpers, this place is underrated.  It's not high end or fancy but it has excellent Chinese food.  I've had dim sum and dinner here and the top was top notch.  My parents love it here and when they first brought me to his place I wasn't expecting much.  Every time has exceeded my expectations."}
{"text":"Yet another typical dim sum place. The good thing is this is one of the cheaper places in the city, with pretty decent quality dim sum. I think on weekdays each dish is like $2.08 or something. It's not the most glamorous place though, and service really is quite terrible. It's hard to flag down people who work here, and pretty much all of them look like they are in a foul mood at all times. When we first came in, no one even glanced our way or gave us a number or offered to seat us or anything.

We just ordered the usual shrimp dumplings, siu mai, rice rolls, congee, etc. From what I remember, the siu mai were too salty, the skin around the shrimp dumplings was too sticky, but I thought both the rice roll and bean curd rolls that we had were better than what I've had at most other places. I also thought their Chiu Chow dumplings were pretty good, and normally I don't even like that dish that much. Congee was bland and not memorable. Overall it's another decent option for basic dim sum in Scarborough."}
{"text":"food is overall average level and price point is great ! 
$40 for 3 girls
Love their beef and coriander rice roll! So tendre and delicious !"}
{"text":"Fisherman Villa is my family's go-to place for dim sum in the Scarborough area. It's among the cheapest dim sum you can find and the taste is actually not bad. Food items are fairly standard (har gow, siu mai, rice porridge, cheong fun etc) and nothing stands out in particular. Selections might not be as lavish as other places but for that price, I can deal with it."}
{"text":"Good place for nice cheap dim sum. The waiters always look unhappy though. Cheer up people!"}
{"text":"My grandmother took me here three times within five days.  Twice we ate dim sum which was decent although somewhat disappointing.  I always thought the GTA had much better Chinese food than in NYC where I grew up as I always went to Toronto every summer growing up.  Some dishes were good such as the rice rolls with shrimp but other just completely failed or came as we were paying the bill.  Their congee though which I appreciated, did not have as much sodium as other places which allows you to season it yourself with salt or white pepper.  Dinner we had here was decent.  My family had reservations (two huge tables) for my grandma's birthday and they had to move one of the tables over since the roof was leaking right above where my mom was sitting.  The food was good but not excellent.  I know I will be back here since it's close to my grandma's but if it was up to me, I would choose another."}
