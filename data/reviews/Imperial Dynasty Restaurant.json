{"text":"Good eats for the price! Ordered from menu instead of buffet. Very welcoming and good service. Portions are big, so there is enough to take home."}
{"text":"We decided their 12.95 buffet couldn't be passed up. Well, I wish we had.  If you want luke-warm breaded to the max, chinese food, go here. Apparently I don't have good buffet skills, according to my dinner-date, resulting in my low experience. However, I did enjoy watching him trying to eat his deep fried shrimp, which still had its shell on. Yes, the order was breading, shell, meaty shrimp, so he had to pick it all off to get the shrimp inside. Everything else was meh. Deep fried items were chewy, dry, and greasy. Non-deep fried items were in flavourless attempts at sauces. Overall, there was a very little selection for a buffet."}
{"text":"This place had no selection like 10 things tops!!! No salads and things looked very old and half empty. We came for our anniversary and we had only one half plate and were sooo bummed up that we left after being there for 15 mins. Not recommended!!!! If I could give it less then one star I would. It's just a bad end to a special anniversary."}
{"text":"Lackluster Experience.  So I came here after reading reviews on yelp- Im not sure what kinds of chinese food resturants people have dined at in the past, but if this one is worth anything over 2 stars then I feel kinda sorry for you.  We came here because Buffet Yangtze on Deerfoot seems to be closed for the time being while they renovate the mall. If you want to know how a proper chinese buffet is like I'd suggest you go there, this place truely pales in comparison. It was like being at all you could eat version of Manchu Wok, all generic \"white\" person chinese and very little selection. And of what was there most had either been completely picked over or dried and old- which at 7 in the evening was dismal. The first sign of trouble was the 10% seniors discount- which I have nothing agianst but sometimes it can be viewed as a resturants last breath. Second sign was an almost empty dinning hall and tiny buffet table.   Im sorry but this place is one star- save yourself the trouble and just get take out."}
{"text":"The food here is really good and if you order take out, they cook it fresh and do not take it from the buffet.  I would not say the buffet is amazing though like some have reported. The food is good but it's not a huge buffet - it's quite small, but has the basics you'd be looking for.  I love their deep fried shrimp but unfortunately they are not deveined but I talked to them about that (completely disgusts me) and I hope they will change that.  When you order take out, the containers are FULL FULL FULL!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow! What a great find in an area where we are all the time anyways! We got a recommendation for this place - you don't find good places if you do not ask right? Ran in, grabbed a menu and called in an order for takeout. Ready promptly in 15 minutes! We have been looking for a good Chinese food place that has combo plates - dinner for 1,2 etc. The combo for 1 was ordered tonight, lots of food included and for only $12.95. I could only 1/3 of mine! Included: Won ton soup (or sweet and sour), spring roll, chicken fried rice, beef and broccoli and your choice of one of their best seller dishes. I happened to get the pineapple sweet and sour chicken which I highly recommend! All white meat in a barely-there-breading. YUM! Everything was really good.  The one thing I would say is that the food needed a bit of seasoning and this was easily fixed at home. BUT, I would rather it be under salted than over salted for sure. There are some won ton soups in Calgary that we had to dump down the drain as it tasted like ocean water. We will definitely be back to Imperial Dynasty. Service was friendly/professional and the order was 100% accurate."}
{"text":"my wife put the order in and they agreeded on substitutes. I'm willing to pay an extra $3. All is well, right? No. I get there, guy at the front fights with me that it is not what my wife ordered. She phones, the man fights with her on the phone, then passes the phone off to a lady to fight more. The food is undercooked and now I need to find something to eat. Next time, I'm going to Ginger Beef Bistro House down the street. Good riddance"}
{"text":"Good small buffet bar, mostly the popular items rather than having a lot of items for show only but unpopular items, great friendly service, good dinning ambient, good foods. Only $12.95 Lunch buffet & $16.95 for dinner buffet. Very reasonable price.  Recommended to try."}
{"text":"There is a reason why this restaurant is still here after all these years.  It has a solid buffet that is not too expensive to cater to the buffet crowd, and more authentic Chinese cooking than the typical Chinese take-out place for the crowd that appreciates authentic Cantonese cuisine.  We have tried the buffet a couple of times and the selection is reasonable for the price you pay.  You cannot compare to a place like Buffet Yangtze, because you will be paying a lot more than what you pay here.  Buffet Yangtze is overrated IMO.  Although they supposedly have a lot of variety of food, you will find that their trays are empty most of the time.  At this restaurant, they constantly replenish their food to make sure everything is fresh, instead of making a big batch that sits there for the entire day like some places.  The traditional Chinese menu items are well prepared.  While it is not top notch quality like you get from other higher price restaurants, it certainly cannot be mistaken for being not authentic Chinese food.  The staff are quite accommodating when it comes to requests about not adding MSG.    Take outs are usually ready in 20-30 minutes.  However, they do experience peak days where it takes much longer to prepare food.  If they say they are really busy and tell you that it will take 45 minutes for the food to be ready, it probably will take an hour or more to get your food.  I have had a couple of occasions where I got there after an hour of my call and still had to wait 10-15 minutes for my food."}
{"text":"This place has a fantastic buffet. We spent about 40 minutes there and watched the food be replaced twice. The food was always hot and the buffet area was kept spotless.  The waiters and waitresses are excellent at their jobs. They are always fluttering around clearing plates and filling up your water glass.  The place is very clean and they give you delicious fortune cookies when you pay.  The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because their won ton soup was a let down. Won ton soup is my favourite and unfortunately at this restaurant, the soup had no flavour."}
{"text":"Good size for a community based buffet restaurant. Although buffet selections are not much variety, food are hot and fresh, which I think is more important than variety.  Prices wise, it's super reasonable. What earns my stars: convenience, fresh food, price. What loses stars: food variety, decor"}
{"text":"I like this place because it is a neighbourhood place. The restaurant was clean and spacious. There were many varieties of table size. It is a great place for big groups.   The food at the buffet is a solid selection. They were bringing out fresh trays of food when they were running out. The dessert selection was lacking, but there was one. A store bought cake, come cookies, and fruit. It was sufficient. I would happily go back again."}
{"text":"I love the buffet and how they offer take out for it. Their spring rolls and won ton soup are very good."}
{"text":"I've always had a love hate relationship with Chinese restaurants, but this place was surprisingly good and so close to home! I usually make a trip out to the North East to Jessica's.   I took the advice of my fellow yelpers and decided to forgo the buffet and just ordered from a menu off urban spoon.  I agree, the food was ready in no time, it was all hot, fresh and pretty darn good.  I ordered my usual fare, beef ho fan, beef and broccoli, chicken and veg in black bean sauce, ginger chicken and shanghai noodles for the kiddies and some plain rice for shits and giggles.  I subtract one star for the following reasons:  no hot sauce was included even though I requested it and the shanghai noodles were pretty bad- bland nothing exciting about them, just long pathetic greasy noodles.  Everything else was fantastic.    I have a hankering for some now...I need help."}
