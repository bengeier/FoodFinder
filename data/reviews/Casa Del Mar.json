{"text":"Brand new to our neighborhood and so excited to bring the family out to try. Based on the name I was looking forward to a good selection of seafood options. The menu did not disappoint! Plenty of selection for everyone's tastes. The kids loved it too!  Looking forward to trying more from this menu!"}
{"text":"Pretty standard Mexican fare. Got the beef enchiladas which were great and my wife had the chori pollo which she raved about. Pricing and portions are on par with other Mexican restaurants in the area but the location is what stands out about Casa del Mar as it is close to where we live. The interior is clean and well lit and there's plenty of seating. We went on a Monday night and there was quite a few people dining in as well. Despite this, we were able to have a conversation without having to talk over the din that is present in other restaurants."}
{"text":"Great food, quick service and the best strawberry margaritas! We love the playa plate. The shrimp are amazing! Been three times and happy every time. Prices are good too."}
