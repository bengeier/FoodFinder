{"text":"Quick and efficient service. The food wasn't either overwhelming or underwhelming. The food came as ordered and coffee top ups were offered . sometimes smoked salmon is a hit and miss in diners but I will say it was nice and there were no ugly gray or brown bits. Kudos!"}
{"text":"I ordered the eggs benny with smoked salmon and did not finish it because the english muffin was soggy, and the eggs and sauce were cold and congealed. Everyone else's breakfasts were similarly unpalatable- mushy \"hash brown\" potatoes, spongy waffle, globby eggs-and all at a price about $4 higher than I would pay anywhere else in the city for better brunch. I will never go back. Service was good, though."}
{"text":"I like going to flo's because it's kind of hidden in yorkville. Only people who know Flo's ever go to it which means it's usually not that full and you can always get a table. They have a big patio on the outside with lots of umbrellas and a diner feel on the inside. Sometimes the service is slow just because they don't have much staff working. 

I'm a fan of the all day breakfast thought I always get my favourite - grilled cheese with sweet potato fries. The grilled cheese is amazing, especially because it is served on this thick egg bread so it is also very filling. Also, there sweat potato fries are delicious - always upgrade when you can."}
{"text":"My colleague and I are regulars at Flo's.  We frequent this establishment at least 2 times biweekly.  While the food always takes a bit of time to arrive at our table, our experience today was horrendous.  Due to two ten-person parties, we waited nearly forty-five minutes for our food to arrive.  As working professionals, we only have an hour for lunch, and forty-five minutes is unacceptable (especially when at a diner).  We were appalled that the servers decided to accomodate serving these two large parties before us -- when attending a restaurant in a group of many patrons, you should expect to wait longer than usual for your meal. Period.  Might I add that when we arrived, the entirety of one of the large parties had not even arrived at the restaurant yet they were still served food before us.  To add insult to injury, our server did not apologize, nor did he attempt to placate us by offering a free Diet Coke-refill or fill our water glasses.  The only slight \"concession\" came with a 15% discount -- sorry but for a $13 meal, this did not alleviate our frustration.  We left without tipping.
This restaurant is in the Yorkville area of Toronto, a neighborhood with a multitude of restaurants that make excellent lunches.  My colleague and I will not step foot again in Flo's -- we will be frequenting New Yorker Deli instead."}
{"text":"Flo's diner has been around since I moved to Toronto 15 years ago. Of course, it used to be an authentic 1950s diner with chrome exterior, that stood on its own on the edge of the parking lot that's now that crap park and a concrete building, just north of Bloor off of Belair.

When they first moved to the new location on the 2nd floor of some weird 70s style mall off of Yorkville, I wanted to boycott. The old booths in the new slick enterior, the shortened bar, the overall stunted growth of it sucked. But, I've slowly come around. Afterall, it's a neighborhood staple.

It's your standard breakfast place, but beware, they will charge you for every alteration or substitution you make, even if it's as simple as, \"no butter\" on your toast."}
{"text":"We've been coming to Flo's for years now. It's one of those restaurants where you just feel at home - where the servers remember your order. We love it here. The service is awesome, food good, atmosphere lively. Sure it can get busy on the weekends and there might be a long wait sometimes, but welcome to the Toronto brunch scene! We're always on the hunt for new breakfast spots but we always come back to Flo's..."}
{"text":"Flo's was good, not great.  Staff was a little disorganized and kitchen was backed up.  But the food was good.  The Eggs Benedict was very good.  Sauce was tasty. My wife had eggs and waffle.  The sausage and bacon were really good. Waffle had good flavor.  Would have been a 4 star but for the service and delay in food.  I used the word good a lot in this review but that best describes it."}
{"text":"Nothing's amazing nothing's awful most is good but doesn't pack a punch. Waffles and Eggs Benny are good. Juice is good. But what  i really love is Flo's Dinah's ambience all stuff from the 50's and so retro and cool. The staff is nice but my one complaint is there was no MAPLE syrup only table syrup ;(
Fun for the family"}
{"text":"The worst!!! Ordered eggs Benedict and it was the most tasteless over priced garbage you could imagine. Service was super slow.. But that would be considered a small issue.. The big issue is the price of the food for the quality.. There are tons of breakfast places, this place isn't even a contender."}
{"text":"I started going to Flo's years ago when they were still in their old diner building... where that structural park is now.  I loved the ambiance and the food.  They use to have an amazing brie and basil grill cheese sandwich.  Mmm.... my mouth waters thinking about it.

Since they moved to their location on the 2nd floor of an office building, I have not been there.  On a whim, I went there this weekend with some friends.  Oh my, how things have changed.  We ordered our food and waited.... waited... watched the table next to us be seated...  watched them order their food... watched them get their food.... watched them almost finish their food ... and we were still waiting for our food.  Honestly, doesn't it just burn when the people, seated after you, are finished their food before yours arrive.  I finally flagged our waiter and inquired if our food order had been lost.  He asked if anyone had ordered a hamburger.  Yes, someone in our party did order one.  Ah... that is why our food order was so late.  It takes extra time for a hamburger.  Wow... a hamburger takes extra time?  Isn't a hamburger normal fare for a diner?  Did they run out of ground beef  and had to go find a cow to get some?  Well... we waited and waited and FINALLY our food came. 

I had the grill cheese which was very oily.  Honestly, cheddar is too oily a cheese for this dish in my opinion.  I think someone ate some of my fries or I would suggest they use smaller plates so the portion of plate to fries makes more sense.  My g/f had a sandwich with a side salad.  Honestly, the salad was only large enough for maybe 3 bites and she mentioned that the dressing was more bitter than she would had liked.  She was hungry after her meal so she kept stealing food off her hubby's plate.  Now, he had the big breakfast.  By the time it came, he was so hungry, he wolfed it down but he couldn't bring himself to eat the sausage that came along with it.  It was way too dry.  Now, my hubby was the one who ordered the hamburger.  Yep, he was the reason we were all forced to wait for our food.  For something that takes so long to make, we were expecting it to be amazing.  It wasn't.  It was very dry.  The word hockey puck was how he described it.  He was still hungry after the burger and was stealing from my already low supply of fries.

Now, the place was packed to the rafters so I'm left scratching my head as to what happened.  Here is my theory.  I know that there are only a few diner restaurants left in the downtown area so sometimes, you have to take what you can get.  I can't believe that the people are there for the food.  My hubby said to me, as we left, that I had better hang on to those memories because this was no longer the same Flo's.  Sad but true."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. Went there with family and friends for Sunday brunch. The owner/manager lacks proper manners. Loud and even yelled at a female server probably a teen, infront of everyone, she was on the brink of crying. Really dirty patio. The salt and paper shakers were green moldy. The katchup was watery, food was absolutely terrible. The Starbucks of timmys around the corner is thousand times better. Terrible place should not be in an area like this."}
{"text":"My friend ordered a shrimp salad and the shrimp was over cooked.
She notified the waiter and she took the order and replaced it with another dish.  The service here is really good, but the food is standard.
I didn't mind the vegetarain chili, but I have had better.

I would go back here to give it another try though."}
{"text":"Breakfast was fresh and reasonably priced.
The biscuits were fantastic.

Small interior. Grab a seat while you can."}
{"text":"This place used to be excellent. Then, either time or money or something else got in the way and now Flo's is average(at best). The food is fine, nothing great and the service is fine. Washrooms are really small and cramped(how did they pass inspection with not enough washrooms for the amount of customers they average??)"}
{"text":"my favorite place for brunch in Toronto. usually very busy during the weekends from 11am to 2pm. amazing service. We know the waiters there for at least 6-7 years. they know your orders by heart. great food, focus on the omelettes. very kids friendly, also give the kids a balloon at the end of the meal. they have outdoor seating during the indian summer."}
{"text":"The food is reasonable priced for a diner you find in downtown Toronto. Their sandwiches are ok. One thing I like there is their grilled mozarella sandwich."}
{"text":"We were in town for business, and staying at the Four Seasons. When we first arrived our rooms weren't ready and we were hungry for lunch. We walked outside and this was one of the first places we saw. At first, I was very leary of this place. It is upstairs in a weird strip mall type building, and the inside is tiny. We were seated on their patio, which was much nicer and larger than the inside. 

I had a BLT & sweet potato fries. The sweet potato fries were some of the best I have ever had - super crispy! They put plenty of bacon on the BLT, and it was cooked perfectly. The people I was with had the salmon nicoise salad and a burger. Everyone was pleasantly surprised at how good the food was!"}
{"text":"Good service, and the food,average but unchanged over the years.   A breakfast place with terrible below par coffee anywhere in the city let alone Yorkville simply does not make the mark. 
 Not the place for Benny if that is your thing.  Get your coffee somewhere else before going there."}
{"text":"I'm currently standing at Flo's with a friend. There are no less than 8 empty tables on the patio and for some reason, they're holding a line near the elevator. We've been standing here for over 15 minutes, and one table has been filled. Inexplicable. 

The only reason I'm giving it two stars, is because I've eaten here before and I know they can't screw up scrambled eggs!"}
{"text":"For a good, basic traditional breakfast, I'd highly recommend Flo's.  

I'll start with the atmosphere, which is probably the best thing about the place.  Classic diner, but on a second floor in Yorkville with tons of windows and outdoor space, so you get to watch the street traffic go by (or perhaps I should say \"go buy\").  

Food is solid, competent diner food.  I had a back bacon benedict and my wife had an omelet, and both were quite good.  We also had a poutine, which was a little disappointing, but it's hard to eat poutine sober and not find it disappointing.

Service was great - Coffee never stopped coming and the food came quickly, so overall it was a great experience."}
{"text":"To say i was underwhelmed at the food and service at Flo's would be an understatement. 
While it may have been labour day, and you could pardon a slight (ever so slight) decrease in the quality in service (who wants to be working labour day). This was awful. We arrived and got seated and ordered quickly, which is the highlight. Form there it went downhill. Once we ordered, we waited, and waited and waited. While the place was relatively busy, no more so than a typical brunch diner on a Sunday or Saturday, the service was awful We saw our food sitting there for 15 minutes getting cold and old. Couldn't even find someone to service it to us. no one would stop to help us. When we received the food it was poorly done. The waffle was crispy (did i say crispy - i meant rock hard) on the outside, raw on the inside. The chicken on the chicken Caesar salad was dry tasteless and lacking anything resembling of flavor - for the few measly pieces that were there. 
I know people who go to to Flo's often. I don't get it. I wont be going back there again and suggest you don't either. BLECH"}
{"text":"Nice staff and good central location at Yorkville. Though the food wasn't that great. My burger had uncooked parts in the middle and I didn't even ask for a medium or juicy one! It was under-staffed which probably because of the time in the day we visited. 
The only reason we chose the place was because it was one of the less pricey ones in yorkville. Every other restaurant was waaay too expensive."}
{"text":"Overall quite a bland experience.
It shocked me that everything from the coffee to the hollandaise was just lackluster.
As a serious bruncher I was quite disappointed."}
{"text":"Busy breakfast in yorkville. Meant to be an upscale diner. Food is decent. Service is fast so they can fill your spot as there is often a wait"}
{"text":"I've been eating at Flo's since they opened their first Yorkville location. My favorite patio in the neighborhood. Service is always the best. It's diner food... consistently good and reasonably priced. I always recommend to tourists because unless  you look for this gem, you'll miss it.  Access is by elevator... so look up!"}
{"text":"\"The best grilled cheese in the city\" my coworkers exclaim! I'm not so sure it's the best, but it's definitely pretty damn good!

Lots of cheese, delicious white bread and slathered in butter. Yum, yum, yum! The decor is everything you'd expect of a diner too; little booths around the restaurant and diner styled stools at a bar by the kitchen for the solo customers looking for an all day breakfast."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Awesome location. A great spot to go eat and shopping in Yorkville. I love the retro decor."}
{"text":"I am not a mac 'n cheese expert by any means, I am however trying to replicate an experience of \"chipotle mac and cheese\" that changed my life. The mac and cheese at Flo's was sadly underwhelming. No sauce to speak of, just naked noodles covered with a smattering of various cheeses, that were a bit bitter actually. The accompanying greens were standard \"green salad\" fare, and I personally wasn't wild about the house dressing. I was nervous about ordering a substitute as per the warnings of previous patrons; \"any substitutions are EXTRA\". 

As far as service goes, there were very few other patrons in the diner so my expectation was speedy, it turned out to be a little more on the slow side. Nothing to take issue with, but then again nothing really to go back for. Honestly even as I am writing this the I am remembering feeling very underwhelmed. My companions meal was standard fare, and tasted as such. 

Bottom line...there are at least a dozen other places in this area where you will eat better for about the same price."}
{"text":"In the urban chic of Yorkville lies a comfortable and cheery diner called Flo's.  It's just up a few awkward stairs.  They have a nice patio and a stereotypical interior - by stereotypical I mean the kind of decor one comes to expect from a \"diner\".


I probably wouldn't make the trek up to Yorkville on a weekend, but it happens to be a stone's throw away from my work which makes it a great place to have lunch.


Being the big breakfast buff I am, they have more than enough egg dishes to satisfy you, your friend, and your friend's friend.  


 
Two eggs, perfectly poached by the way, and peameal bacon.  Did somebody say BACON? 

I went just the other day with one of my favourites, Bana.  It's her birthday soon.  Bana likes eggs and manicures, just like me!  Happy birthday, xoxo."}
{"text":"Can't really give it more than 2 stars even though the service was good, everything else was lacking. I didn't enjoy the experience at all. From the moment I arrived in Yorkville to meet my long time friend and fellow agent Sue at Flo's. No parking on any Yorkville streets will basically rules out Yorkville for me in future, we can thank Kristyn Wong-Tam Toronto City Counselor for that, how she gets elected is beyond me (she kisses the ass of unions is how she gets elected). She thinks we should walk everywhere. Toronto is and always will be a car city until they city gets it together and builds transit. Anyway, back to Flo's. I liked the menu and the fact that you can order half orders of just about anything. I had half order of eggs benny, tasted not good, and looked lonely on the plate with just home fried potatoes. Sue had the same. The place looks like it could use a good cleaning, and the staff while nice and friendly didn't add any charm of an old style dinner. This place looks old and tired. I did get to meet Peter the owner and he was very nice. I would not go back. Considering this is \"Yorkville\" I expected a lot more and they didn't deliver."}
{"text":"A 50's style diner in the middle of the chic, cool, can-be-pretty-expensive area of Yorkville is a welcome sight to me.  

The food isn't great, but it isn't screwing up the classics either especialy when it comes to breakfast food.  I oppose auto-gratuities on principal, which was applied to our group of 7, but the fact it came in separate bills was nice.

Great patio view from the 2nd floor, but a patio spot can be hard to get.  The diner gets busy for brunch.

All told, I'm glad Flo's is there as a reasonably priced brunch spot, but I'm not terribly excited about it either."}
{"text":"Super Retro looking diner (think Back to the Future 1950s) in the heart of Yorkdale. You even have to take a swanky elevator to get there.

Fairly busy on a Sunday Morning for brunch but we didn't have to wait for a table.  I got the giant breakfast with eggs, sausage, back bacon and regular bacon ($15) and my girlfriend got the eggs benny with peameal. Everything came quickly. The only catch was the eggs Benny were cold and sadly we had to send it back. It was returned no problem and they made a new one, only problem was it was with ham instead of peameal. 

Overall the service and ambiance was good but the food was a bit lacklustre."}
{"text":"Flo's Diner is what it is, a diner. Small, charming little diner with quick, friendly service."}
{"text":"A delightful find in the heart of Yorkville. Take the inside ambience of the 50s, or the outside ambience of fresh air on the 2nd floor pretty, umbrella terrace, add to that good food and you're having a lovely experience. 
Breakfast was hot, fresh and delicious and the salad niçoise at lunch was a hard-to-find treat. Both meals were plentiful and the service was terrific."}
{"text":"Many moons ago, Flo's used to be on Cumberland, right in front of Sassafraz, nestled inside the Village of Yorkville Park . That joint looked like those curved yet Art Deco dinners you see in every 50's movie. Inside, you would find lots of booths and a bar shaded in bright reds, greens and of course, cheesy chrome. You were being sold the whole retro, greasy spoon experience and it was great! I remember at times going for just their floats, they were awesome.

Where that building used to be now stands a very tall, yet insidiously generic condo. Yup, progress, you gotta love it.  

So Flo's relocated to Yorkville street into the second floor of one of most boring 70's looking building for miles around. In fairness, the 70's was a bit of a tragic era for architecture, nevertheless I digress, it could be argued it is better to have a Flo's than no Flo's at all. Even though the place now only looks --ironically, only about 50% of how 50's it used to look like in the past. 

Unfortunately, the soul that made the place seems to have been left at the old building and what you are left now is a somewhat cramped, overly rushed and sadly, more generic experience.  

My eggs benny seemed uninspired taste-wise, and... you too will question why on the menu, you are offered the dish in half portions or regular sizes. Ah... what?
A one egged Eggs Benedict? Wha...? 

Or your basic egg dish comes in three sizes... so if the smallest size = one egg, ergo you are paying $6.25 for one egg. Really? I know this is Yorkville and all but this place does not merit Yorkville prices. For example, the home fries\wedges\chunks of potato where nothing to write home about so in the end, you tend to feel mildy ripped off. Sure I am not expecting a deal but I am expecting quality. 

Back in the day you may have let some of it slide due to the different vibe but when the place now feels so packed and you have the distinct feeling the server is expecting you to just eat, pay and dash, well, it is harder to not get as picky. 

Requesting more coffee seems like a task rather a natural service/customer exchange and in fairness it may be due to the place being so hectic. It is still not the best locale to go with a friend and catch up, specially if you want to chat for a few minutes after your meal is done and want enjoy what is left of your coffee. 

Also, there is one rule all restaurants should apply themselves too: 

\"Do not ever present the bill to the customer until he has requested for it. \"

That is basic common sense of service. Case in point, the last time I was there, my plate had just been off the table for no more than 2 minutes when the server, in a quick but well practised motion slid the bill as she walked away exclaiming the mandatory yet ostensibly false 'Take your time.'

Rushed much?

Unfortunately it somewhat sours the experience a bit as I wanted to ask for extra coffee and a side which was not dessert. 

How? See, as she have had half haphazardly asked if we wanted some dessert to which we had said no, she immediately assumed that it was high time for us to be shown the door. So when she came back, she beat me to the punch by dropping the bill as she rushed by our table. 

At that point we decided it was better to just go. So do I like this Flo's? Sort of, although I think it is due more to nostalgia than for what the place stands for now. Having said that, it would still not be my first pick... nor the second."}
{"text":"The service was a bit strange, one guy didn't really seem to care and one guy was on top of his shit. 

The food was good, it's a diner, I wasn't expecting silver service or the gourmet food found in 5 star restaurants but we had burgers and I wasn't displeased. My wife also had a burger but she was NOT impressed, patty was dry, topping (guac) was brown and the bun was below average. The fact that I ordered salad but got fries was, as always annoying. When server didn't check back until we had finished meant that we couldn't change the fries for the originally ordered salad. 

The prices are reasonable and I would go back but only if I was really hungry."}
{"text":"Meh. Overpriced. Ok food. The waffles are better at the Coach House."}
{"text":"I love Flo's especially with the warm weather. The patio is great and there is a large selection of food, its usually my fancy brunch place."}
{"text":"Flo's is a great place to grab something casual or a nice sunday brunch.

The service is decent and the prices are a little more than one would expect from a diner but this is Yorkville after all. 

I'd say I frequent about 3 times a month and I'm always happy when I leave. Recommended."}
{"text":"What do you get when you put a 50's-60's style diner (which are supposed to be cheap)  and put it in Yorkville? Average prices for average food (as opposed to super cheap prices for average food - which is what diners are supposed to be). 

Atmosphere - 3/5.  It's not your typical breakfast joint in Yorkville, with all the fancy/schmancy stuff, nor is it a run of the mill breakfast joint.  It tries hard to be \"posh\" 50-60's, and while I appreciate the uniqueness, it's not all-out.  Like at least have a juke box right?  It's not bad though, as their uniforms are even diner style, which is cool.    When I see themed restaurants or areas/attractions, I prefer them to go all out as opposed to doing \"hybrids\" (also probably why I like authentic ethnic cuisine more than fusion). 

Service: 4/5 - very friendly and personable waiters and waitresses.  They are busy, but they don't forget the little things (e.g. the waiter saw I didn't have hot sauce on my table and asked if I wanted any and they also asked if I wanted a coffee refill after I got my bill).  

Food: 3/5 Ordered the peameal eggs benedict.  The poached egg itself was perfect, and once you cut into it, a nice yolky centre came oozing out (love it!).  However, I found the hollandaise sauce a bit too sweet and overpowering.  I prefer the hollandaise sauce to cover most of the egg, but not all of it plus the English muffin.  Oh yeah and the English muffin, very run of the mill, but didn't seem crispy enough.  Don't get me wrong, I'd have it again, but it wasn't exceptional.  Very pedestrian.

So basically, I ate in Yorkville and I didn't get ripped off! BONUS POINTS!! :-)

Overall 3.33/5"}
{"text":"If Riverdale was filmed in Toronto this is probably what Pop's Chocklitt Shoppe would be modeled after. It's got that old-timey diner vibe. It's in Yorkville but it's still pretty reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I of course, had to order the grilled cheese, with bacon and tomato.  Absolutely NO cheese slices in this one. The bread was buttery, lots of cheese and crispy bacon and a tomato. It was awesome. Just what I was craving for breakfast.

My friend ordered the eggs bene. He loves eggs bene and said they were just okay. I would absolutely come back here for the grilled cheese and the patio, but not sure I'd  order anything else on the menu. It's typical diner fare... 

The staff however are friendly and this joint has been around for a long time. It's a cute little place. Def try the grilled cheese :)"}
{"text":"When I left NY to Toronto, one thing I missed was hanging out at Tom's Diner.  Then (around the time of TIFF), one of those page sixers took a photo of Rachel Bilson & Adam Brody (aka Summer & Seth from the OC) eating at Flo's.  Eureka!  A diner just a few minutes walk from my place.  However, I associate diners with late night grub.  And despite having posted hours till 9 or 10 pm, on light nights this place just closes early, unannounced.  The food is okay, but really pricey and nothing special.  There's some attempt at making it look like an old-school diner, but I still missed Tom's.  

One nice thing is that in the spring/summer you can sit outside and the outdoor seating is really great.  However, don't even try to climb the spiral staircase in the winter, since it's icy as hell.  Instead, just go inside and take the elevator up a level."}
{"text":"Love the old school/ vintage feel of this place! 

We came on a Sunday morning and the place was packed, but we were lucky to get a seat right away!

It took about 45 minutes until we received our food but it was beyond delicious. I'm so impressed with the staff and cooks who manage such a busy restaurant but are so details-oriented. Our breakfast was scrumptious and every bite was perfect. 

We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch with my boyfriend and his friends. This place is located on the second floor in a building in Yorkville. The place is decorated exactly like a diner inside. The seating was comfy and I liked the easy and casual atmosphere, which is great for a weekend brunch. The servers at this place was all very friendly and attentive (attentive meaning they got us what we needed and allowed us to have our space). The food portion was just right. I ordered the salmon egg benny - the egg was not over cooked, it was nice and runny. However, I thought the hollandaise sauce needed more flavor. Overall the entire experience was good and I would come back for brunch, or maybe lunch to try out other items on their menu."}
{"text":"Came here a couple Sundays past - super busy!  It's one of the few diner-esque brunch places in Yorkville and gets the job done, but little more. 

I had a coffee and the veg egg-white stir fry.  I  found the coffee a tad bland, typical diner-style, I'd say.  My egg white stir-fry was tasty, with broccoli, green opinions, avocado, onions and peppers.  It was served with a side of whole wheat toast.  Service was friendly, but brisk...and coffee wasn't always refilled on a regular basis.  

It's a solid diner spot in Yorkville, but it does come with Yorkville prices.   I definitely didn't feel like I was getting a good deal..."}
{"text":"We were walking through Yorkville trying to decide on a place to have lunch, when we saw that Flo's looked busy and had a patio. It was one of the few places in Yorkville I haven't eaten at, so I figured why not?

We couldn't get a table on the patio since it was too packed, so we settled for inside, which was fine because they had huge windows that were all opened anyways. 

We ordered, service was pretty slow. When my food arrived I was actually disgusted. I ordered the chicken sandwich with a side salad. The salad \"dressing\" tasted like mud, and the lettuce itself looked dirty and brown. My poor excuse of a sandwich was barely edible, and it was a struggle to swallow. 

I didn't say anything, until my sister piped up and said her meal was pretty disgusting and the bread of her chicken burger was stale. We decided that our meals were both equally disgusting. 

Our friend had ordered chicken fingers and fries, had nothing to complain about, but I guess you can't really go wrong there.

To their defense, I did see a lot of breakfast food passing by which looked pretty good, and maybe it was just what we ordered that sucked. But the service plus the bad food killed it for me. Next time i'll stick to Remy's."}
{"text":"Affordable (for Yorkville), delicious and friendly staff! Love the 50s style decor! I got the mac and cheese special and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Flo's is a great little spot. The food is good, the service is quick. Most people I'm appreciate that without any kind of guff you can get individualized bills. My favourite dish is the mac n cheese. The all-day breakfast options are good. The patio offers one of the best outdoor values in Yorkville. The period decor--that is, a '50s diner--is a little precious, though Flo's comes by it honestly as the restaurant has been in Yorkville for quite some time."}
{"text":"I was just introduced to Flo's this past weekend and I was definitely pleasantly surprised to learn about another reasonable and amazing brunch/lunch spot on Yorkville.

As well, my happiness due to discovering this place did not end because the food was wonderful too!

My friend and I did our Sunday afternoon brunch there and all I can is I had trouble picking out my meal because there was a huge selection!

They have at least 8 to 10 different omelettes on the menu, different fresh juice options, as well as the sweet tooth breakfasts such as pancakes, waffles and french toast.

I went with the pancakes topped with strawberries, homemade whipped cream and fresh Canadian maple syrup and it was delicious!

The pancakes were so warm and buttery, they melted in my mouth!

So basically, as you can tell, I had NO PROBLEM clearing my plate!

I washed down my pancakes with a fresh cup of coffee, which was brewed to perfection.

My friend got a yummy looking omelette with green peppers, tomatoes, mushrooms and cheddar cheese scrambled into the eggs. The eggs were accompanied with crispy whole wheat toast and fries.

Together, our bill came to $22!

With delicious food, a great seat on their patio on a sunny Sunday afternoon and a cheap bill, who could ask for more?!"}
{"text":"Good lord, after a full on night out on the town we need grease and carbs.  Thank you Flo's, you delivered like no other.  Now don't get me wrong, they also serve healthy grub, but for our purposes, they get 5 BIG ONES!  Big, tasty, hearty omelets with lots of fatty meat to wash it down.  Best place to grab breakfast in this area."}
{"text":"In the heart of Yorkville with a great view on the patio/balcony area and an interior that has a great retro feel. 

Food here is typical diner food but is done really well. Service is top notch and prices are spectacular. If you're looking for something more grounded in a neighborhood that can sometimes be snooty, Flo's is what you are looking for.

Overall, this is the place to go for good food, good atmosphere, and good times. Try the sweet potato fries, pretty sweet."}
{"text":"Great spot for weekend brunch. Line ups s can get kind of long. If you don't want to wait, nespreso is a great option a block over.

{"text":"This place is really quaint and cute. Old school diner vibe with old signs throughout.  Very friendly staff and good food. I ordered the \"Eggs All Meaty\" which was good but too large for one person. They were very accommodating when I asked for non dairy milk and stevia for coffee (which they had both!). I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I'm a fan. Yes, yes I am. 

I only started going to Flo's recently but ended up back there three times in a month. It has a good price point, a good variety of food and the portions are large. A good refuel for the Yorkville shopping. I find the area lacks good 'pub food' or 'american food' and Flo's covers its bases well. I recommend!"}
{"text":"Looking for a charming, unpretentious, reasonably priced spot to eat in Yorkville? Think it's impossible? Think again! 

Across the street from Nervosa, of the second floor of a squat bunker of an office building is one of Yorkville's most delightful secrets - Flo's diner. 

This is a true diner - with a no-nonsense attitude, staff that know how to turn tables in the blink of an eye, and an all day breakfast menu to help combat any hangover. 

I've been coming to Flo's for seven years and have learnt to live it for many reasons. At first it was their glorious sun trap of a patio that had me coming back. Then I was taken in by their epic grilled cheese sandwiches - built on thick Texas toast and grilled to crispy perfection. Definitely get these with the fries and bacon inside - and a milkshake or malt on the side. Then studiously ignore the plastic surgeon's offices that share the building on your way out. 

But mostly, come here for brunch, or breakfast. The eggs bennies are some of the best in the city, the service is spot on, the cups of coffee are constantly refilled and the retro decor is sure to charm all your friends and family. 

Who says an old dog can't learn new tricks? They now have gluten free bread and a great awareness of which items (beware the hollandaise sauce!) contain gluten. 

Yorkville has soul - you just need to look up to find it."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch twice. The location of the restaurant and the friendliness of the server are superb. The only complaint I have is the wait time for food."}
{"text":"Staff are ok. The food is alright. I used to come here a lot ten years ago and it was much much better."}
{"text":"The exact kind of food you expect from a diner, but more expensive, and quite mediocre.

There are other fantastic options a stones throw away from this place."}
{"text":"Damn - that's some good grilled cheese! My date ordered the grilled cheese with bacon ($9) and it was pretty darned good. No Kraft singles here! Super buttery and  perfectly grilled without being burned. Lots of tasty bacon. I tried the grilled chicken sandwich ($11) without the onions. The chicken was generous, moist and juicy and the basil pesto and sauteed mushrooms were great. Added a little mayo because I like my sandwiches saucy. The cream soda was A-mazing! Served up in a classic glass bottle with a straw, it has a cute nostalgic flair. Plus, it just tastes better this way. Servers were very friendly and speedy and made us feel welcome. 

The only bummer was that the sound system was broken so we couldn't listen to the usual 50's and 60's music, which I love. Oh, and my side salad was pretty sad. Just some wilted mixed greens with no other veggies and only one type of dressing available. The fries were not bad, though. 

I wish it was a bit busier, because the food here is really far superior to anything I've had at Fran's, Golden Griddle,  or Mars. 

I can't believe I found an affordable, unpretentious and delicious diner in Yorkville. I will definitely go back. Hopefully the sound system will be working."}
{"text":"This was amazing. I recently came here for breakfast on a  Friday, and it wasn't even that busy. The service was great, and the waiters were kind and friendly. I got the \"Big Breakfast\" and it was delicious. It came with a waffle, and powdered sugar! The atmosphere was great, and it's a great place to come with kids. I would definitely come back anytime!"}
{"text":"A charming family diner with great prices and filling food. I love breakfast at all times of the day. Home fries are spectacular here and the grilled cheese is next level. They use real cheese and they are always grilled to perfection every time. When I'm feeling splurgey I go for the eggs Benedict. The bechamel sauce is very creamy and adds the perfect touch to a hearty dish. I bring my friends here occasionally and sometimes I come on my own. It's that great!"}
{"text":"Flo's is a great breakfast place in Yorkville. The patio is lovely and shaded by huge umbrellas. The scrambled eggs, homefries, and toast (2 eggs are $6.25) are yummy and hit the spot whenever you eat them, breakfast or otherwise. I've also tried the veggie burger, which was quite good, but nothing to rave about. I'm eager to go back and try more of the menu - everything looks awesome as it comes out of the kitchen."}
{"text":"Flo's diner was a throwback to a 50s diner and I really enjoyed the atmosphere. It's very fast paced and great for lunch/brunch. 

I went on a Sunday at around noon and waited 30 minutes, it's located on the upper level and it's quite small. After being seated, we decided on what to get: 
- Eggs All Meaty
- Big Breakfast 
- Eggs with Ham 

The service was quick and refills for coffee was given without having to flag down our server. The food tasted fresh and loved the multigrain toast that comes with the meal. I would definitely venture to Yorkville again to try out the omelettes. Worth trying and having a diner experience considering the prices weren't outrageous."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Peter the owner is always around and takes great care of everyone. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"VERY nice staff. Lady up front who greets and seats everyone is extremely nice and pleasant. Owner (I think) is this nice gentleman who has a beaming voice and very cherry. 

Prices for food are way cheaper than other places in Yorkville. Portions for the breakfast homefries (one or two small potatoes cut up) were kind of small but tasted great. Overall portions are smaller than other bigger sized greasy spoons but for the price, flavour, staff, ambiance, and location (in Yorkville) this place is more than reasonable.

I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Not impressed, but nothing to really complain about either.

A group of friends and I showed up for brunch on a Sunday, and of course the first thing to note was that it was packed. We were informed that the wait would be \"at least 20 minutes\" and we all debated whether or not to wait it out. In the end we did, but I can't really say it was worth it.

The food isn't amazing-- just the usual brunch offerings. For the price, you can definitely find better or at least similar quality food for less. But that's the occupational hazard of dining in Yorkville, I suppose.

I guess what earns Flo's some redemption points is the patio. On the second floor terrace of the building, you get a nice view of Yorkville. There are huge parasols if the weather is cooperating (sunny!) and it has a very \"ladies at lunch\" feel to sit out there enjoying the sun, your eggs benny, and watching the Yorkville regulars shop themselves silly.

Also major props to our waiter. The problem with patios or sitting outside in general is that you usually get forgotten, or the waiter doesn't come by as often. Not so here, where our waiter was so efficient, I think he was a robot. We were in a group of around seven and he took our orders in two minutes flat-- same story for coffee refills, and cashing all our separate bills out. Much appreciated, would definitely come back just to see him work his magic again.

Oh, and of course, as some other reviewers have mentioned: take the elevator to the second floor after entering the building to get to Flo's with maximum ease. Try not to get distracted by the premium custom-build racing cycling store on the first floor (like I did...)!"}
{"text":"So, I was so excited this morning!  Flo's Diner is just down the street from me in Yorkville.  The decor is great, diner style for sure.  I ordered a well done omelette and my daughter ordered french toast.  Omelette was very burnt and my daughter's french toast had little specs of burn al over it, for a minute I though maybe they sprinkled vanilla over it or cinnamon, but no.  My favourite thing was my daughter asking if the maple syrup was the good stuff.  Waitress, said no, there is an extra charge for real amply syrup.  They did not charge me for my burnt meal.  I won't be going back to Flo's."}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday brunch. Vegetarian plate was good. Always crowded but people are friendly and nice."}
{"text":"Very affordable old-school fashioned diner in the heart of Yorkville! I love it and would absolutely come back again. It's got what you would expect from a diner in terms of fare, has very spacious seating, and is a perfect place to catch up with friends before or after a nice stroll around outside. The prices are also very reasonable and not exorbitant given the location."}
{"text":"Cute patio. My menu looks like it has never been cleaned. There are what looks like short shaven facial hair all up inside of the plastic. Plus my water had something nasty floating in it. It looks like other people are enjoying their food unfortunately I have to pass."}
{"text":"Great patio, great food, great service. I've never had a bad meal here, easily one of my favourite brunch spots in the city! 

Fresh ingredients"}
{"text":"An amazing diner . Perfect food. Great option. Coffee is great and the diner vibe is perfect! 
Surprise find. 
Go here!"}
{"text":"Went here for a team outing after a successful month. They were accommodating for the big team, however they didn't have enough servers for us so that slowed down service a bit. 

Ordered 3 eggs Benedict. Hollandaise sauce was extremely thick and seemed overcooked. Egg yolk was also practically cooked. Overall a disaster as both the yolk and the sauce were overcooked giving me a jaw workout. The saving grace for this place was that the sausage and pancakes tasted delicious! Definitely not a place to order something that requires more technical cooking skills."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch. We were in area visiting feom metro detroit area. Food was good I had the club with fries. Friend had grilled cheese looked really good. Waitress was very nice. The place looked clean. Overall good experience"}
{"text":"Good breakfast. Good variety. Good prices. Good service. For the Yorkville area it's a good deal if you're not looking for an upscale restaurant."}
{"text":"Good for brunch or casual lunch, nice Reuben sandwich, dirty bathrooms and floor but food is good and in a nice neighborhood"}
{"text":"Found Flo's by looking up breakfast spots in Yorkville so gave it a try. Great, central location...2nd floor accessible by elevator but nice patio to people watch Yorkvillians. Seems like a family run operation, which is a nice touch. Friendly staff. Food was just ok and what your guy expect from a \"good enough to do the trick\" diner."}
{"text":"This weirdly upstairs diner is very good; much better than it needs to be. Ought to be?
Cookie in the back clearly cares about what he does, and the food comes out hot, right, well-thought and delicious.

Not a sign of a hot house tomato or a bagged lettuce leaf.

This totally exceeded my expectation.

When was the last time you got still-hot toast!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday evening at around 5:30 pm and there was no crowd. I liked the atmosphere, it was relaxed, casual and family friendly. 

Service was courteous and efficient. But the place wasn't busy at all.  Probably only two groups of patrons, besides my family. 

I ordered the turkey hamburger special, with a side of soup and my husband ordered the all meaty breakfast. My kids ordered off the kids menu - chicken fingers and fries and chicken Cesar salad. 

The soup of the day that evening was the clam chowder. It was creamy but a little bland. The turkey burger was good but not outstanding. My hubby's all meaty breakfast was better. It came with eggs, sausage, bacon, peameal bacon, potatoes and toast. He also got a good amount and was able to share with kids. 

The bill was not bad - around $50 for a family of four. I wouldn't hesitate to return, the next time I'm in the area, but I'll go with the all meaty breakfast instead."}
{"text":"Flo's Diner is everything you love, hate and love to hate about Yorkville, all at once. Once upon a time, it occupied a snazzy old-school diner space at street-level. All brushed chrome and red vinyl, it's retro charm made occasional lapses in service forgiveable. 

Today, Flo's still churns out diner classics to patrons seated in the same red leather booths. Only now, it does so from a second-floor perch in a groovy 70's inspired office-tower-condo-retail oddity that's typical of these parts. Access is a challenge for the uninitiated. Brave souls may totter up a set of external corrugated metal stairs. Those in the know head into the building, up the elevator, and out to the diner doors. 

The greeting that one receives varies from indifferent to inconvenienced. Staff aren't exactly happy to see you, but your money's as good as the next guy's, so you can come on in. 

The room itself is cramped  functional; transplanted diner fixtures, counters and bric-a-brac are meant to evoke the original location. It doesn't quite work, but large windows at the front o the shop let light in, and give one an excuse to people-watch. 

Food is what you'd expect. Soda is served in plastic tumblers, all-day breakfasts on clunky maroon-ringed plates. Salads are capable, but undermined by the ocasional badly wilted green and too-tart balsamic dressing. Grilled chicken is underseasoned and tougher than the majority of Yorkville shoppers. A Caesar salad fares better, but is undercut by too much, too-watery dressing. 

Maybe Flo's isn't really a salad place, anyway. They do sell a credible club sandwich: more chicken, this time seasoned properly and cooked to toothsome goodness, with bacon burnt-to-hell and fresh lettuce and tomato (better in summer than winter). Bonus points for the rich challah; deducted for slightly skimpy slices. 

Burgers require two hands; basic, solid grub. 

Grilled cheese looks good, but I question the value of ordering something that I cook when I'm really in no condition to cook. 

Fish and chips sees golden-battered crispy fillets alongside chips referenced below. It's fine; even better for being priced a few bucks cheaper than most. I doubt it's fresh, and certainly not organic, wild or any other clever descriptor, but throw enough malt vinegar on anything and it tastes like malt vinegar. 

Coleslaw is non-descript; fries are better. They are golden and crisp; their sweet-potato cousins are just a bit sweeter and crisper. Skip both in favour of an order of onion rings; massive veggie beasts that blanket sweet onion with tons o' crunch. 

Like any good diner, Flo's is best measured on the strength of its breakfast. Coffee arrives slowly, and refills require prompting; it's fine. Eggs are done to a turn. Breakkfast meats are well-done and potatoes provide proper carbohydritic soakage of foreign chemicals. You can laze at the table until the caffeine kicks in, and you're ready to start your day. 

Neither exceptional nor horrid, this place is a solid middle ground. It has it's quirks, but as in life it's best to just go with the Flo(s)."}
{"text":"I had breakfast at Flo's Diner this past weekend before heading home from my bachelorette party.  We were looking for something filling for a reasonable price and Flo's delivered. I apologise I have no photos, I was really hungry.

It's a fairly small place and most of the seating is outside on a second level patio.  Due to how hot it was we opted to sit inside.  Our wait was maybe 5 minutes tops and the staff really work hard to get people seated, fed and out the door without making it seem like they were rushing us.

The food was phenomenal.  I ordered the big breakfast, I could tell right away the eggs were real, the bacon was cooked perfectly and the waffle was the perfect size (not too big).  My maid of honour had the meat breakfast which wasn't lying, there was so much meat.  The sausages were a little too big but still delicious.  My sister and a friend of mine both had a grilled cheese which I wish I ordered.  Every time they picked the sandwich up to take a bite I could see all the real melty cheese goodness goop out the sides.  Honestly, I'm still thinking about that sandwich.  

All in all, great diner food.  The staff were friendly and it wasn't an arm and a leg for a great sized meal.  I'll definitely try to come back for breakfast on future Toronto adventures!"}
{"text":"I admit, after living in New Jersey for my formative years, I am not a big fan of diners. But we were starving, and Flo's has a lovely outdoor space that seemed promising, as did the menu which featured breakfast all day and ample sandwiches.  The real downside here, aside from the inattentive and sometimes brusque service (at one point, I literally felt the waiter was pulling things from me - my plate, my glass, the credit card machine) is that all of the food tastes of nothing. My sandwich tasted of nothing (though a mozzarella and tomato with basil should taste rich), the fries tasted of nothing, and my dining companion's eggs tasted of nothing.  It looked like food, it smelled like food, but it was as if the taste was sucked out.  The happier looking customers here all had milkshakes, so perhaps that's the way to go. Otherwise, I would skip this."}
{"text":"One of the best places in Yorkville with great food and even better staff. For unpretentious cuisine and quality character, come to Flo's. You cannot go wrong."}
{"text":"I went here today with another couple and my husband. I had the single egg benedict no meat and after I ate came straight home since something wasn't right. I have been sick ever since. My husband just called the restaurant  to advise them and the guy tells him everything is made fresh and they are just closing. Suffice to say, he clearly didn't care since he didn't even take his name or number in the event we may not be the only complaints today. I would definitely not recommend and I am positing the review in the event that I was not the only person sick today since that is more concerning since may speak to a bigger issue."}
{"text":"I'll give it a 3.5. My friend and I wanted to grab some breakfast before work and ordered some great food. I got Benedict Peameal, and my friend got the big breakfast. The food was good, service was a bit slow but the atmosphere was like a retro themed restaurant (cutlery needed to be cleaned). Just an average place to eat for an okay price."}
{"text":"This is what a diner in Yorkville looks like. The usual gruff and grit being replaced with something more clean and polished, given a more delicate twist. From the understated retro-diner decor, to the very nice and softspoken waiter, to the music (Feist's \"1,2,3,4\", the second we came in. I felt like I was on and episode of whatever the modern-day equivalent of Dawson's Creek is), to the volume of the music (almost quiet enough to be background, but loud enough to enjoy) to the lighting. 

This goes for the food, too. My steak sandwich was made on that very soft and and doughy-type of foccacia bread with sundried tomatoes and mushrooms on top. The steak, the entire sandwich, well it downright gleamed. The most picture-perfect steak sandwich I have ever ordered. I did wish the meat itself had a *tiny* bit more flavour, cuz the HP sauce that I had to add didn't seem to mix quite right with the other, more bourgeois flavours. Nonetheless, it was delicious. The tangy, creamy salad dressing was also fantastic, way better than the usual half-assed toppings for a side of mixed greens.

The atmosphere was grand; everything perfectly understated but still carrying a certain distinctive character. I would (and will) go back there in a heartbeat.  
...In spite of the fact (as Anna alluded to) that they charge an extra $2.50  for \"real\" maple syrup with your waffles (instead of table syrup)!? 
They're lucky I don't really like waffles anyway.

...Me again. I just couldn't leave without adding that they played George Michael *and* Velvet Underground, side by side. Pretty much my idea of a dream playlist, in case you care."}
{"text":"This place is epic and has been in the area for many years. Its done in a 50's sort of diner way but the food is not 50's.
I always order the eggs benedict. They have fresh squeezed O.J. and I have had the salad nicoise as well. 
For breakfast, brunch or lunch especially when its summer and the patio is open. Its wonderful!!!! Staff is great. Service is great."}
{"text":"This is a nice place with a cool funky retro feel to it.  The server was really nice and patient as I tried to make up my mind on the menu. He even made a great suggestion to half an order so I could order something healthy with something a little more decadent.  It was a great idea.  I had oatmeal which was surprisingly delicious and half of an eggs benedict.  It was a great brunch with friends made even better with nice service and yummy food!"}
{"text":"No idea why or how Flo's is 3.5 stars because I think this place is one of the best brunch spots in Toronto. It's small, unpretentious and the wait is rarely more than 20 minutes. The food comes quick, the service is good and they refill your water and coffee almost every 5 minutes or always ask how everything is. Everything is under $15 and the portions are generous. I usually get the spinach/mushroom/goat cheese omelette and they are generous with the goat cheese. Come here."}
{"text":"So..Let me start by saying, it's called Flo's Diner because, it's a diner. I understood that going in and in the right scenario, diners are good. 
One note.. look up.  It's on the second floor of the building it's in. We almost missed it because we were concentrating on the ground level of the buildings. Once we found it, we walked in and waited to be seated. The nice man in the kitchen noticed we were waiting, looked around for the hostess/ server and since he didn't see her, advised us to just sit anywhere. We found a two person table by the window and had a seat. The server came over , barely acknowledged us, didn't make eye contact and asked for our beverage order. We ordered coffee.  It was ok. I ordered a waffle and bacon. It was ok. A waffle and bacon..Nothing more nothing less..My bf ordered the meaty breakfast. It was ok. Diner breakfast. There was another gentleman there who came by and inquired about the food. We told him it was fine. I would've given three stars instead of two if that lady wasn't so rude and disengaged the entirety of our stay."}
{"text":"Great old school looking dinner in the heart of Yorkville.

Had a chance to hang out on the patio for a breakfast meeting.  Food was good, atmosphere and vide were great.  

Good find and definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Flo's is great. They have amazing omlette's on a sunday mornign after a night out. 

Can't go wrong here. Especially when the patio is open. 

If I had one negative to say it would to have the booths redone because there are tears in some of them from all the use and putting duct tape isn't really a good look."}
{"text":"Went there to try out their grilled cheese and bacon with cole slaw.  Although it was one of my better grilled cheese sandwiches before, I think something went wrong when I ate it recently as it wasn't as good as I remembered.

It's still one of the better grilled cheese sandwiches as they use eggy bread.

Maybe it will taste right next time I go there.  As such it does not go to my Reasons to Go Downtown list."}
{"text":"When shopping in Yorkville, I often have two pretty major issues when hunger hits:

+I have already spent so much money, so I can't splurge on lunch.
+Even if I feel like splurging, I take shopping seriously, like a sport, thus I am never dressed appropriately for a Yorkville restaurant. 

The above reasons lead me to Flo's, a simple diner sitting high above Yorkville. The food is OK, what you'd expect, and it hits the spot. I enjoy their fresh juices, nice staff and people watching patio."}
{"text":"The staff was very nice but service was a little slow. I had a feta and mushroom omelet that was good. It had a lot of cheese in it. The wheat toast and potatoes were good. The waffles are a must!"}
{"text":"Needed a \"normal\" breakfast after days of Yorkville hotel morning fare.  Colleague recommended Flo's.  It was nearly empty on a weekday morning; nice and quiet.  

My colleague and I were on business so dressed in dark suits, we looked the the typical Bay St. cut-outs.  Perhaps on that account, the staff were not the most overly friendly but were efficient and effective.  No issue there.

It's a diner, so I expect food you eat, not look at.  I wasn't disappointed,  my Tuscan omelette fit the bill with the usual OJ and straight coffee to wash it down.  It was surprisingly tasty, served hot, and the sun just started shining through the filmy 2nd floor windows.  It's a diner...

It was still a bit pricey, not true diner prices, but the ambience is there.

The nice thing was when it started filling up with locals and casual regulars; there were normal conversations of down to earth Canadians, in the middle of Yorkville.   I sure looked out of place, but did not feel it. 

The Law has eaten and will return..."}
{"text":"Great place for a casual breakfast or lunch!  We enjoyed this place twice on our short trip to Toronto.  Service is quick and friendly, and food is exactly what we would expect from a diner."}
