{"text":"The Penn Township and the Trafford area have many pizza places.  This is by far the worse.  I ordered a regular pizza, it had so much cheese on it, that it wasn't even cooked all the way through.  I called to complain, and the person that answered the phone said there was nothing she could do, because the owner wasn't there.  I asked when the owner would be there and she said that she didn't know, that was the jist of our conversation.  I got no refund or new pizza (which at this point I wouldn't of wanted anyway). I hung up, and ordered from Dom's in Trafford like I normally do, and they have never disappointed."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza! Great crust,  loads of cheese, and great thick cut pepperoni. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"The best loaded cheese fries I've ever had in my entire life. I would walk 500 miles and I'd walk 500 more to get their loaded cheese fries."}
{"text":"We recently had a Sicilian Pizza from Wize Guys Pizza in Trafford. It was delicious. We ordered it with sausage, onions & mushrooms. Let me just say they were very generous with the toppings as well as the cheese.  Not ever having their pizza before, I almost ordered it with extra cheese. So glad I didn't. There was more than enough on it. Wize Guys Pizza is definitely our new pizza place."}
{"text":"This is our go to local pizza shop. The big sicilian is always amazing, and the wings are always on point. If you are looking for a new pizza place, make this your stop."}
{"text":"There are many good pizza places in the and the competition is tight.  Decided to try tonight and my pizza was ok.  It was very heavy, and loaded with cheese!  If you like this type of pizza, then perhaps it may suite your taste? 
That's about the extent of my experience here. 
I will be try their traditional pizza next time."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this new pizza place in Level Green, but I didn't get what I had hoped for. If you've ever been to the area you know that Pizza is not something lacking but I always like trying new places. 

The new shop was clean and the staff was very friendly when I went to pick up. The owner was there and he was friendly as well and thanked me for giving them a try. 

Now, the pizza was an 8 cut THICK Sicilian pizza. My girlfriend was excited since her favorite part of pizza is thick chewy dough. Well I am afraid to say it wasn't doughy at all. The dough was as crunchy as toast and crumbled and crunched way too much. 

The vegetable (green peppers and I onions) were almost non existent, they were sparsley spread across a a sea of cheese. The best part about the pizza was the cheese and it was the one area they really did well. 

I might try them again some night they're new and things could get better. I can't honestly recommend this place but of course it's pizza, and even bad pizza isnt bad. There are just so many options in the area that make better pizza at similar prices."}
