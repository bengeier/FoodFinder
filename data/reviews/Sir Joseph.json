{"text":"I quite liked this place - really nice decor and setup. The drinks were a tad pricey for me, but pretty standard for the type of bar that it was. It is a pub so you gots to buy yourself some food! They set someone sort of appie (fried/puffed rice noodles, I believe...like those puffed shrimp chips but they were neither shrimp...or chips...) in front of us, as we didn't know the food rule, so that was much appreciated, but I don't know if people will be able to get away with that forevah. We went on a saturday night and it wasn't too loud, so a great place to hold a convo about what the f is happening in quebec politics, or your topic of choice! I walked by another night and it was toooooo busy....I despise. too. busy. So go there before word gets out! 

ooooh I should talk about my drink perhaps? Yes. It was good. I had something with whisky and bitters on rocks. A charming little sipper for this wintry time of year. Have that if whisky holds a warm little spot in your heart as it done mine!"}
{"text":"Tasted the MTL a table menu and was very disappointed. Expected more from the main dish (carrots and porc) -- the burger was not special either 
Although the service and ambience are friendly and cosy the food is under-par"}
{"text":"Lovely place, not too busy. Great food and decent wine list, reasonably priced. Service was fantastic to top it off!"}
{"text":"Recently refurbished/rebrand :
Just great. Cheap and good with original cocktail.
Keep the good work!"}
{"text":"Small but nice food menu, burger was delicious as was my friend's fish and chips. Treated myself to a glass of Craigmore to finish off, which was lovely. 

Our server was great, atmosphere warm. 

I'm sure I'll be back!"}
{"text":"C'est bien pour prendre un verre dans une ambiance de pub, la nourriture est ok. Le service etait très bien."}
{"text":"I love this place! Great atmosphere, cozy, nice staff! Have been multiple times, and will keep coming!"}
{"text":"La serveuse n'était vraiment pas sympathique. Il y a eu erreur dans la commande (sans aucune excuse de la part de ladite serveuse). Et pour couronner le tout ma copine a été malade une bonne partie de la nuit à cause du hamburger. Vraiment une mauvaise expérience"}
{"text":"Some hits, some misses. The fish of the fish n chips is excellent. the chips poor. The steak pie is very poor. Dry, mealy, without any gravy. Very good oysters. Limited selection of beers for a a beer and pub food type of place.

Attentive and friendly service. Great music (well, I liked it), not too loud."}
{"text":"I enjoyed oysters)) Mondays on special
 Very charming quite place
I loved oysters)) quick service
Nice presentation !"}
{"text":"J'y suis allée à quelques reprises et à chaque fois, j'ai la même impression. Une ambiance agréable. On consomme à notre rythme, sans se faire presser.

Les bhajis d'oignons, le fish & chips, les calmars, le burger, c'est franchement à se rouler par terre."}
{"text":"Service is warm and welcoming. Booze selection is really good. We ordered the cod fish and chips w/ mushy peas. Serving was a pretty meager portion for $16. Really skimped on everything in the meal...seemed liked breaded finger length scraps of cod rather than proper fillets. Mushy peas were ice cold... not sure if that was intentional as I've never had them served cold before. Still tasty regardless of whether the temperature was by design. What the kitchen lacked, the servers made up for. Very warm and attentive. Drinks were good. Bar staff is great but the kitchen needs to pull it together. They have potential but I think that they would benefit from sourcing better suppliers and serving better preparations."}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday evening ($1 Oyster night !!), wanting to try a new place with the boyfriend. I've always biked pass this place and thought the interior looked nice but never actually went in until last weekend.

Good : The beef tartar with whiskey is amazing! I would say this is one of the best tartars I've had in awhile. The runny yolk was a nice touch and the whiskey wasn't too overpowering. The decor is pretty neat. 

Bad : Okay, I came at 8pm. There was 2 waiters/barmen and only two tables, just us and another group. There was literally one waiter per table. The service was terribly slow. The food took awhile, which sucks because we ordered all raw foods (beef tartar and 4 dozen oysters). The oysters were a bit small, but the sauce was pretty good nonetheless.

Bottom Line : Good tartar, but I've had better oysters at other places. Pretty indifferent about going back."}
{"text":"Nous sommes venus un lundi soir pour profiter des huîtres à 1$ et nous n'avons pas été déçus!
Nous avons aussi pris le plateau de la mer et nous avons été abasourdis par le prix raisonnable de celui-ci. Le tartare de buf était bien, les côtes levées également. En général, ce n'est pas de la fine gastronomie, mais la nourriture est simple, efficace et ne coûte pas les yeux de la tête.
Bonnes bières, ambiance très agréable. Nous allons très certainement revenir!"}
{"text":"This place was great. Welcoming atmosphere- a great bar although classified as a restaurant thus only able to serve you a drink if they serve you food. The onions bahji was great, and the beer was even better. Not to mention the wonderfully outgoing bartender, whose name I never got but I know her as \"Enos.\" She was great and very helpful with the menu which was not in my native tongue. Will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I popped in here right at 4pm when they opened and had a lovely experience. Decor is simple but elegant and it felt bright and welcoming inside. The server was very attentive (possibly because I was the only one there) and let me try a couple different types of wine before I settled on what I wanted. I didn't have a chance to try any of the cooked food, but I did have an order of oysters. They came with 3 sides/sauces and I must say, the homemade lime-horseradish was delicious! Menu looked good, I want to go back and try some things!"}
{"text":"Endroit cosy, j'y ai dégusté de très bonnes huîtres pour finir avec un bon brownie avec de la crème fouettée maison.  C'est un bon pub de quartier,  j'y retournerai!"}
{"text":"Vous aimez les huitres ? Elles sont au menu.

Bel accueil, le service était un peu décousu (on perdait la serveuse), mais rien d'autre à reprocher. Le menu est intéressant et j'ai adoré les côtes levées. L'ambiance est décontractée. Idéal pour se retrouver entre amis (on peut réserver). On ne se trompe pas en choisissant cet établissement.

À vous de découvrir!"}
{"text":"Really great! Went once, had to return. The menu is a perfect size. Places it's self as a true but. Has great fresh gastro options as well as some modified Indian items as well. Had the ribs which were really great. Well cooked but could have been saucer. The burger was great and filling. Fresh toppings. The first visit the onion Baha'is was a bit oily but still soooo tasty I ordered it a second time and it was not too oily.
Mushrooms on toast were also really great. Not a huge portion but still so yummy. Mushrooms had perfect flavour. Also ordered the fries. They were pretty good. Perfectly cooked. Couldn't eat them all so took them home. They tasted better the next day after warming them up in the oven the next day :p
The La Joseph Scotch ale was really good!!!! One of the best black velvet one of the best I've ever had (and I've had a lot) the white velvet was also sooo great. Also the staff are so kind!"}
{"text":"Able to experience Montreal's flavor here
Chicken Parmigiana with pasta and lots of cheese
Came from US for summer excursion, felt welcome here"}
{"text":"Back in the day this was a french restaurant with whom I shared a backyard. Back in the day i didn't have the kind of disposable income to visit said restaurant.

Now times have changed; I moved out, the french resto moved out and in comes Pub Sir Joseph. Now this isn't exactly your traditional pub like in Corry or East Enders but i am not a Pom/Limey so I could care less.

Before my foray at Pub Sir Joseph, I was at La Cuvee nearby sipping lots of dark porter and scotch ales'. First thing i noticed was a Scotch Ale and I jumped at the offer. My friends tried their cocktails but I will reserve that for a later evening and perhaps another review.

Food came in form of the Sir Burger and fries (shaped in amazing potato wedges.....) 
The burger was great, being a sloppy sandwich/burger/wrap/etc eater myself, the burger manifested itself into a sloppy joe soon!

Raph our server is pretty cool and took care of us (yes i do read my bills and not just the cost) and if he is reading this, amazon.ca ;-)"}
{"text":"This might have been our favorite bar in Montreal. 

The atmosphere here was relaxed,  composed, swank, inviting.   It wasn't as loud as most places on St. Laurent, which was a welcome change. On average, the crowd was may 10 years older than that of most other places we went. The interior design was interesting and hip without being overdone. I really liked the lighting arrangements.

They serve a handful of beers and spirits and some well-crafted cocktails (there was one with scotch and a bit of maple syrup that was particularly tasty), but the menu is composed mostly of wines.  The bartender was very friendly, entertaining, and patient.

My travel companion and I stopped here relatively early in the evening. We were only going to get one drink, but ended up staying for most of the night, and would probably have gone back the next night if they were open."}
{"text":"This is a place we used to enjoy. Food was super good and not pricy. Unfortunately they've just changed the menu, and the portions are pretty small and pricy. I've honestly never seen a steak tartare served with chips... we also shared the seafood plate which was deceiving, and a charcuterie plate which was very good. Did not get small plates for sharing. Service is slow, so don't go if you're in a rush. 
On the positive side, the tartare was very good and we had a view on the kitchen, we saw that everything was freshly made. Our server was very nice. 
I wouldn't recommend this place for food anymore, but if you need a drink go sit at the bar, service wise they are excellent."}
{"text":"Really nice place on the corner of St. Laurent and St. Joseph.  

What I liked:

Open kitchen, so you can see the prep being done, I always find it interesting to see how the different kitchens work.
Drink selection was good
Staff very friendly and present
very nice layout, they have those high tables with stools and high benches along the wall, may not be for everyone, but I like them.

What I didn't like:
Not much really, it can get a bit loud, but that's because the place was packed.

Overall a definite repeat, and improves the neighborhood options which was lacking somewhat in nearby quality bars."}
{"text":"Oh yeah, Un nouveau venu sur le boulevard St-Laurent! 

20:01, regroupé avec des amis autour de bières et de burgers, nous attendons impatiemment le début du match de hockey sur l'immense télé. Les bières sont excellentes, particulièrement la Joséphine, et le burger est juteux à souhait. 
Tout au long de la soirée, nous avons commandé à notre rythme sans nous faire presser par le staff, qui lui fut tout à fait charmant!
L'espace entre les tables est suffisant pour donner l'impression d'intimité, ce qui est rare dans ce quartier. 
Définitivement à revisiter pour une soirée tranquille entre amis!"}
{"text":"Great little place to have a drink watch the game. Food is in very small portions, the mushroom tartine was to die for very creative, trout was ok not salthy enough, burger was super tender and cassis fruit cheesecake was delicious. Although ambiance isn't that much great for a thursday night sort of a more relax mood than Buvette"}
{"text":"I love a good pub. It is my favorite type of drinking establishment. The relaxed atmosphere, good food, good music and a great selection of drinks - there is a reason why I spend WAY too much time at the Burgundy Lion instead of something closer than my apartment. During the Montreal en Lumière festival last month, after going to La Cuvée (an awesome beer, whiskey and retro music event) at L'Eglise Saint-Enfant Jesus, my friends and I walked across the street to Pub Sir Joseph to grab a bite and continue our evening in the right way.

Pub Sir Joseph was opened by a group which included chef Martin Juneau of Pastaga fame and is located along the Main corner St-Joesph in a space which has seen numerous restaurants come and go - the previous tenant was there for under a year from what I recall. So not the most successful location it would seem but Pub Sir Joseph has some positives going for it - A British gastropub is not a common sight in the Plateau and chef Juneau and company's menu influences is a nice selling point.

The interior space has a clean, more sparse vibe than your typical pub - solid wood and stone tables, high chairs and an L shaped bar which is the focal point of the space as it should be. The dim lighting was all candles on the tables with a few pot lights and an interesting lightbulb fixture in the middle of the room. The music was present but not too loud - conversation was actually possible which at a bar/pub around midnight on a weekend has become a big challenge in Montreal. The service was quick and very friendly - to the point where the 2 waiters on the floor would actually start conversations with us a few times over the evening. At first, that level of attention was a little odd - not necessarily a regular occurrence for any of us - but in the end, it was rather endearing and enjoyable. The fact that it didn't slow down their service was pretty impressive as well.

On the drink front, Pub Sir Joseph has a nice selection of local and British beers as well as different cocktails - with a primary emphasis on gin as they have 10 different varieties in house. I went with their \"Smoky\" cocktail - Bowmore scotch whiskey, maple syrup and angostura bitters. A nicely balanced drink - the sweet maple syrup softened the bitterness and bite of the whiskey and bitters. 

Foodwise, Pub Sir Joseph focuses primarily on pub-style food in small plate \"Tapas\" style designed to allow sharing amongst the group as you sit around with a few drinks. Certainly an intriguing concept for a pub-style joint. The menu hits some classic pub items with British and Indian influences, however they definitely are having fun playing off the conventions of the setting. First up, we ordered their Worker's plate - a mixed cheese and charcuteries dish. Served with some bread and marinated vegetables, there was a nice combination here - chorizo, salumi, cheddar, goat cheese, etc. A nice starting plate.

Next up was the Onion bhajis with curry mayonnaise. Bhajis, for those who don't know, are essentially Indian fritters - in this case done using onions. Inherently sweet due to the onion, they had a nice crunch to them which added something texturally. The curry mayonnaise added some bite without letting the curry become overwhelmed - something that used to bother me until the day I was introduced to true good Indian cooking by some of my University classmates. I only wished they had been more Bhajis on the plate! 

The final dish we ordered was their Meat pie composed of beef, kidney, braised vegetables and scotch ale. Took some time to reach our table (which our waitress had told us ahead of time) but a solid dish worth waiting for. A nice flaky crust with a rich stewy mixture of beef and vegetables - classic meat pie and a great choice given the evening of drinks we had just had.

Our visit here was a last minute call but one that definitely enjoyed. Chef Juneau's influences on the menu are visible in terms of quality and presentation - as a fan of Pastaga, that is a huge positive for me - and I loved both the variety of Gins and the quality of cocktails available. The service was very smooth and much more personable than I expected. Pub Sir Joseph fills a void in the area and did enough for me in our brief visit to warranted a larger meal as a well as further late night gatherings. For a pub experience, that is really all you can hope for.  

Cheers!"}
