{"text":"Ordered jerk chicken roti, goat roti, and stew chicken with rice and peas.  Jerk chicken roti was too saucy, way too much jerk sauce, which made it too salty. The goat roti was good, but it didn't have enough goat meat. Overall, a good goat roti with good flavour, not too salty, and a good sized portion, but could do with a bit more meat and a little less sauce.  $4.99 for the stew chicken on rice and peas. The rice and peas didn't have too many peas, mostly just rice. And it came with a quarter chicken leg. A pretty good deal for the portion. It would be difficult to find such a good meal for a similar price.  $25 for everything. 2.5 stars out of 5."}
{"text":"I like to visit this restaurant at lunch and take advantage of the lunch-sized $5 menu (1/4 chicken jerk with rice and peas). Combined with an order of pouhlourie it's comes in at about $10 after tax and fills me up.   The main menu board offerings seem to be on the pricey side vs. the food received, but it would take 20 minutes to drive down to Ghandi Roti; so convenience often wins even at a comparable price."}
{"text":"The food here is really good and cheap. They have all the Trini offerings you would expect: roti, jerk chicken, etc. You can get a large portion of chicken and rice and peas for $5. The owner is super friendly. The restaurant is also licensed and pork free."}
{"text":"Looks worn down inside, but the food is great! I tried the jerk chicken with rice and it was nice and spiced. The fried chicken with fries or rice is also good. It's pretty cheap but the location is hidden inside a small plaza. Overall, it's a good restaurant for quick and cheap food."}
{"text":"Really good and satisfying meal. I'd really recommend the roti chicken. It was simply amazing!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time and ordered jerk chicken w/ rice and peas and a roti skin w/ gravy..  Wasn't a big fan of the jerk chicken (actually it was pretty bad) and ended up throwing out the rice and peas (wasn't my cup of tea) but the roti was delicious."}
{"text":"great roti,been going there for years,nice guy owner,  i always order the boneless chicken roti,its actually dalpourri which is a step up from basic roti,itlos the trini style roti,lots of juicy gravy and decent amount of chicken along with the usual potatoes,ive had the jerk chicken in the past and its been pretty good, a little dry.if you are looking for a good roti its always consistent,cant miss and if you eat in have a gingerbeer to wash it down.this flemington is a busy plaza so parking is always a bit of a challenge but its a cheap and cheerful place."}
{"text":"I was craving some chicken and this place was right where I was and I thought I would give them a shot.  I ordered Jerk chicken without any sides of any kind.  This version of Jerk was not like the Jamaican Jerk that I am used to from many other places I have tried.  This was a soy sauce based version that I found lacked depth since I could only taste salt as the main spice with a hint of Jerk seasoning.  But I will say I got a massive portion for 10 bucks... I just wish it would have tasted better.  You are better off to try a non-Jerk Chicken Dish and go try one of their other foods"}
{"text":"Awesome neighborhood gem! I love their 5 dollar daily lunch special (Jerk Chicken or curry) I should visit there more often since I live nearby!"}
{"text":"Having lived in this area for over a decade, coming to the Carribean Palms was always something of a treat on the way back from the old food basics or the post office.   I've also noticed that it has something of an identity crisis with much of the food. On one hand you'll have your classics like wild rice, coconut candy, roti, ox tail and jerk chicken. On the other you'll have chinese menu items like chow mein, orange duck, beef stir fry and so on. Either way, they're always very friendly for a family operation and despite the wait it's always well worth it. Some of my friends of complained about the portion sizes, but then I make the comparison to the Island food chain and they kind of suck it up as the prices are almost identical in respect to portion sizes of both.  Either way, despite the unusual cross between the two food styles, I am definitely a long time customer and fan. Though I do go in less frequently than before."}
{"text":"I just had a beef roti from here and wish I hadn't.  It was dry, beef was tough and there was hardly anything in it. $9 down the drain!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch for my first meal during my visit from the states. bad experience, not very friendly. ordered the oxtail meal. They do not make traditional caribbean food and served the oxtail and rice and beans with cucumber instead of cabbage. Did not mind the cucumbers but the oxtail was dry and not flavorful. Was very disappointed.   And to make matters worst, I had not exchanged my money yet so tried to pay with a credit card. Was told they did not accept master cards. Both of my cards are master cards so I was forced to pay in cash. The meal was 11 Canadian dollars but was still charged 11 US dollars dispite me explaining to them that the US dollar was stronger than the Canadian dollar. I did not want to argue so I let them keep the extra money. wont ever be going back"}
