{"text":"Archie's has delicious wings, and one of my other favorites: sweet potato fries! If you're looking for a place that has beer for any taste, Archie's will provide. It's not the most exhaustive list in the city, but it does cover the major styles from American macro to the stouts and IPAs. Service is good, and the staff are very friendly and helpful. Archie makes a point of talking to his customers, too. In the South Side after work? Give Archie's a try, and order the house smokey BBQ wings. You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Archie's is great-- good specials, lots of TVs, but the food isn't great and there are too many hockey fans (which is pretty much par for the course in PGH). And Archie is always hanging out, which tends to keep everything in order, as he is a great dude and always up for a chat."}
{"text":"The only bar with NFL Sunday Ticket in the Southside... best fried cheese too!"}
{"text":"Looking for an expensive beer from a plastic cup?  Like bad music?  Do you enjoy terrible service?  Are low grade chicken wings your thing?  Come to archies, where all these needs are met."}
{"text":"They have a great and very friendly staff. $0.35 wing night most days of the week and great beer selections at good price. Archie walks around and is very friendly him self. I did some dry rub wings and they cook the skin perfectly crisp on the outside and tender on the inside. 

The fries are awesome too"}
{"text":"Waited 45 minutes for a tremendously awful cheesburger. It was burned and the bread couldn't have been more stale. Would have given them 1 star except they had Blue Moon, so that's the one upside."}
{"text":"Archie's is my favorite wing place in the world. I haven't been to a bar that offers a wing with so much  chicken on the bone - far more filling than Quaker Steak / Buffalo Wild Wings.

Their sauces are much better as well. Unlike most commercial wing places that offer sugary-processed tastes, Archies taste homemade. 

The only downfall is the wait. Fortunately for my friends and I, we go there to relax and have a couple of beers so we don't mind waiting but if I were to be in a hurry, I would be SOL. 

It's definitely a sports bar ... I think there are 14 TVs, not including the gigantic screen hanging on one of the walls. It's really cool that the owner, Archie himself, hangs around. It's makes the place feel more authentic to Pittsburgh. 

Cheap Beer. Cheap Wings. Filling. 

Go there for yourself - even if you hated it, you're still filing your stomach up while spending less than $10. 


...I haven't tried any other food but the menu looks great. Surprising variety.

Spicy Thai
Smoke BBQ ... mmm!"}
{"text":"Went there for wing night. Started with a diet Pepsi. It tasted funny. I'm not sure if the syrup was low or had gotten moldy, but i was told \"That's just how it tastes.\" 
Well that is not how it tastes every other restaurant so me and nine people I'm having wings with tonight went to Cupka's and the diet Pepsi there tasted fine."}
{"text":"Awesome! Go there nearly every Thursday. Cheap wings and $1 Blue Moons. Can't beat that, go there get some wings and a solid buzz then at midnight go back to Oakland, more specifically Peters Pub and get drunk!"}
{"text":"We went last night for wings. 10 wings for $4.00. We ordered three kinds: Hot, Hot Thai and Season Salt. We asked for them extra crispy and we were given extra crispy wings. The Hot Sauce was Hot...looks like a mixture of Buffalo sauce and Sambal. The Hot Thai wasn't hot at all...looks like they used Sweet Chili Sauce. They were good, though. The sweet flavor was a good contrast to the Hot Wings. And the Seasoned Salt ones let us just enjoy the wings on their own. I got two 22 oz Yuenglings. She got a Raspberry Ice Tea.

Good trip. Everything tasted good. Waitress was nice. Plus, no smoking inside the bar so we just got to enjoy our food."}
{"text":"One of the best places to go for chicken wings in Pittsburgh.
Severe is always great and fast. I like the staff they do a good job. The chicken wings are super. We had garlic and Parmesan , six pepper rub and sweet Thai. Enjoyed them very much I will be back again and again great job."}
{"text":"Archie's does wings right. Fried until perfectly crisp, no breading, and a delicious hot sauce livened up with chili flakes and seeds. Incredible and just the right amount of heat. Highly recommend this place for wings in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"One dollar blue moons.
nuff said.  

thursday nights is when I'm there.  Never knew it was possible to get drunk on almost five bucks.  of course it depends on how much i've been eating and such but its a great deal and wings are also 25 cents monday through friday.  You do have to order them in orders of 10, order a drink as well and are charged for extras like blue cheese or celery but its not bad overall.  I really wouldn't come here if it weren't for the blue moon special, but I don't know how you could beat that.  The blue moons come in 12oz cups i believe and a tiny tiny wedge of orange."}
{"text":"Archie's is great for cheap, quality wings. The place has bar seatings on one side and spacious tables for groups on the other side. Staffs are friendly and service efficient. There are TV's at every angle--360 degrees of visual stimulations. When I was there, I saw Archie himself. He is a very friendly and social guy. 

Okay more about the wings. From Monday-Thursday wings are 35 cents each, all day. However, you must purchase a drink with your wings order, minimum of 10 wings per order. Even with the drink purchase, the meal was still pretty cheap. I was able to try three flavors: spicy Thai sauce, Cajun rub and flaming hot. Spicy Thai was on the sweeter side and not spicy at all. Cajun rub had a spicy kick to it and flaming hot pretty much went up my nose and I was in tears. The wings were juicy and meaty with just the right amount of flavors. My favorite flavor so far is Cajun rub. 
 
Overall, I highly recommend Archie's for those with a passion for wings. It was a very satisfying experience, and easy on the wallet."}
{"text":"Great place for wings and beer. 

Your classic sports bar - watch games, drink, hang out, eat bar food. 

The only thing I absolutely hated was the buffalo chicken dip. It was weird, watery, and the chicken bits were drowned in lemon... So if you're into that sorta thing, then dig in. 

I don't suggest coming here when it's super crowded, though. The waiter was very overwhelmed and kind of rude to us because it was packed. Don't know why he took it out on us.

Although it's in the Southside, it's more tolerable since it's removed from the craziness down the street. So don't let it scare you that it's in Southside!"}
{"text":"Only stopped in for a beer, so can't give a too detailed review.  But it had food, cheap drinks and some TVs.   Place was pretty empty when we went (about 9:30 on a Sat night), so we got good service."}
{"text":"My 1st Check In...???  Seriously?  Do they start over cause I Gita new phone?  Anyway- the wings are now$.40 each with a min order of 10 and u NEED TO BUY A DRINK!  Why do people think they can come in here and order a water and 20 wings?  Is there something wrong w u?  Wings are what's called a 'loss leader', like turkey on Thanksgiving- they sell turkey cheap hoping you'll buy the 'accoutrements' there also...  IM me if u need help with this.  Anyway- DELICIOUS wings...  We will def be back..."}
{"text":"Came here for trivia night and 40cent wings. Service was normal but the trivia was so fun and the wings were very good especially for the price. Atmosphere was fun and exciting!"}
{"text":"Monday through Thursday wing night 35 cent wings! However I believe you have to buy a minimum of 6 or 10 and also a beverage - but totally worth it because the wings are the best I've had in Pittsburgh. Flavorful and just the right amount of sauce. I got the buffalo and it felt like I had ordered a platter of wings for at least $8 from a restaurant. 

Finger lickin gooooood!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite place for wings. For some reason I am in love with wings recently, so I've been coming here more and more. How can you beat wing night here almost every night?! 

Wings always come out hot , crispy, and delicious. I typically get their hot ranch and garlic parm.  I do need to try the other sauces,  but I am sure they are just as good!! Aside from the wings they do have good drink specials. 

Just remeber, no take home boxes for the wings so order wisely!!"}
{"text":"This place was great. I went for wing night (which is literally 4 days a week) where they have .40 cent wings and they were huge!! Honestly some of the biggest wings I've ever had. I had the ranch dry rub and they were absolutely covered with the rub. Amazing. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because the drink \"special\" was $3.75 for a Bud Light which is so not a good deal, and they charge you $1 for a take out box. But I would definitely come back and I may have just found my new wing spot in the city."}
{"text":"We ordered blue moon drafts and the beer was obliviously flat and we had to send it back. Wings were very good but the food was served in plastic baskets with wax paper. Cheap looking presentation. Also men's room was out of paper towels which is annoying  Bartender/server was very nice and attentive which was a plus."}
{"text":"First time there - great wings!  However, the service was horrible.  We ordered cheese sticks appetizers and when they came, we had to ask the waitress for plates and napkins!!  The real kicker was when we asked for a to go box, they charged us a dollar!! REALLY!"}
{"text":"I love their wing nights. Great wings so crispy and yummy. Got lots of TVs too. My favorite location for Monday night football and Thursday night football."}
{"text":"Is it weird to say that my favorite restaurant is a dive bar in the South Side. If it is, I don't care. Archie's is the one place that even during the day on a Tuesday the place has a crowd, and for damn good reason, THE WINGS. I have eaten at any place that sells them in Pittsburgh, and honestly Archie's are my favorite. They are meaty like a cow leg, and hot out of the fryer and the sauces, oh the sauces. They have so many different kinds, and yeah they charge a dollar for a big thing of blue cheese dressing, but damn if you don't want to pay that, the sauces are great on their own, and the buffalo ranch has your damn dressing mixed in.  No matter you still end up walking out of there full and only spending like 7 bucks and that's for 20 wings and a beer. That's how much 10 meatless wings cost from anywhere else.  

No joke my mom went there, and loved it. A 50 year old classy women goes there and destroys the wings. I warned her it was a dive, but she didn't care, and now she wants to go back for more."}
{"text":"Completely empty on a Thursday night. Got there around 11:15 and saw there was a sign for cheap beer from 9-12. When I tried to order it they told me it ended at 11:30 but still wouldn't give it to me even though I had been there at 11. Immediately left and will never return. Stupid bar."}
{"text":"Archie's is a great place to get cheap wings in the South Side! I usually go here on Wednesday Nights for trivia and wings, and it's always a great time. The wings are up there with Bigham Tavern for best wings in the Burgh!"}
{"text":"I am a fan for one big reason... my Baltimore Ravens loving boyfriend and I can come here and watch their games without being heckled and without having too many obnoxious Steelers fans annoying us (and as a Steelers fan, let me add this- there is a fine line between the good ones and the bad- not all Steelers fans are bad).  

Service is quick, beers and drinks are cheap, and the bar food is just that, bar food so much is not to be expected.  

If you want to see teams other than the Steelers on the NFL Sunday ticket and want a place that is always open all day on Sundays, Archies is your place.  Blows another place not too far down the street out of the water in terms of service, food and atmosphere (for a small dive-y sports bar at least)."}
{"text":"You Fancy! Well if you are, Archie's is not for you.  Archie's is a dive bar of the Southside.  Wait Amil, all bar's in the Southside are basically dive bars. Well if you want a no frill, drink to your heart's content, local's drinking mecca: this is your spot.

Once you are inside, squeeze out some real estate at the bar, order a coupe of rounds, and enjoy the fact that your wallet is not getting exploited. This place forgoes the frills and charms that other bars on Carson use to justify the extra $5 per drink.  Need to start the night out or end the night somewhere, head down to 24th and let the party happy crowd make your night and expect a good time."}
{"text":"Wings are now 40cents. 

Just a reminder that you have to order them by 10 (only one flavor) and you cannot take them home.. which is such a pain. Choose one or the other (wings by the 5...... or  by 10 and you can take them home) Sometimes i can't eat  10 wings so i would order 5 to begin. I never finish my wings and sadly have to leave them behind. 

Also, ranch or blue cheese doesn't come with wings (insert laughing emoji) you have to pay $1 for it.. And its the super tiny cups -_-

 The good thing is both regular and boneless wings are part of the deal. 

One other issue i've been having is the pop tastes blaaahhh. I usually avoid pop but you have to buy a drink to get the wing deal and they dont offer unsweetened tea so i go with pop. Please clean your pop hose. :\"}
{"text":"I used to love coming to Archie's, but it has sadly gone down hill. The Wing Night special has increased in price from 40 cents a wing to 50 cents a wing, which would be tolerable if the quality did not go down as well. The wings used to be large and crispy, now they are smaller and of a lesser quality. 

The waitress here is not particularly rude, but also not particularly friendly (which is to be expected in a Southside joint like this one). 

Charging $1 for a dinky takeout box rubs customers the wrong way. I understand why they do it, but it still strikes me as nickel and diming.

Unfortunately, I saved the worst for last. Lately, the bar has reeked of urine to the point where it interferes with the meal. 

Hopefully Archie's can get back to what it once was but it is trending in the wrong direction. I would avoid until things change."}
{"text":"Every time here at Archie's is a good time! Fresh ingredients cooked just right. Homemade salad dressings and varieties of wing sauces! Sweet potato fries too.. Omg nice fresh mushrooms!!! So good! Wings are delicious - and my boyfriend is SUPER picky about wings. Tonight had the fabulous buffalo chicken salad, carnival fries, and steak hoagie - \"pretty awesome - probably the best I've had in Pittsburgh\" - and he's been looking!## owned by a great friendly guy who's the face and the name."}
{"text":"Came for dinner and ordered wings. You have to order in 10s, so I got 10. When I couldn't finish all of them (I had three left), I asked for a box so I could eat them when I got home from a rehearsal. I was told 'sorry, we can't let you take them because they're on special.' Not sure I'll be back to support a business that woke rather throw food away then let people take it with them."}
{"text":"Great service, high quality food, fresh. They let me in with a baby ;) and stroller. There was a lack of flavor on the pork although the cut was impressive. The grapefruit pie also lacked grapefruit flavor. I was really excited to try it but no grapefruit :("}
{"text":"I was there on a Wednesday night with a large party from my work.  We've had big parties there before as a reward for our employees.  I ordered a hamburger and the experience of eating that piece of meat is one I'll never forget.  I bit into the burger and hot grease went everywhere all over me.  It literally exploded out of the burger like a bullet coming out of a gun.  The grease went all over my cell phone and unfortunately all over my Puma brand hoodie that was a Christmas gift from my fiancee.  The grease did not come out after a washing cycle and has permanently stained the entire left hand sleeve cuff of the hoodie.  It's noticeable and disgusting.  I told the waitress about it and she didn't seem to really care.  She said \"I don't think that's going to come out\" and then walked away.  I've contacted them via Facebook about this to see what they have to say."}
{"text":"35 cent wings Monday-Thursday. Hot flavor a miss, but the other flavors are tasty. Drinks are cheap. I should be back. The keep raising the price on the wings though."}
{"text":"I can't go back here
Don't ask why, but it was fun.
Oh Archies...... Sorry!"}
{"text":"As a transplant to the Pittsburgh area nearly six years ago, the one thing that's a constant is finding a good place to go to watch my hometown team (Baltimore) play on Sundays. There are plenty of bars with Sunday Ticket, and I've tried quite a few, but to find a place with a decent crowd is another story...especially in Southside. Based on the number of fans of other teams also pulling up their seats for a game a Archie's, I'm not alone in giving Archie's a thumbs up.

This past season, I finally decided to check out Archie's, as the other options in Southside had let me down, and it was a generally nice experience! The bartender was really nice the few times we were in, and the one time I came in and had to ask for them to turn the game on, Archie himself (assuming it was him based on the striking resemblance to the menu drawing) was super polite in putting it on the TV closest to my seat. Need I remind you, he was polite to a guy in a Ravens jersey. That's the type of service that will bring anyone back.

If you walk in expecting anything special, food-wise, you're asking too much, but the food isn't bad. It's exactly what you'd expect upon seeing the place, and after checking out the menu. My favorite thing on the menu is the meatball hoagie. It's actually good, and not just in that \"well, it's good for here\" kind-of-way. It was actually good stuff. The wings and chicken tenders are okay, but I'm definitely giving my positive food ratings to the hoagie.

The prices are reasonable, the food is decent, and service is good. It's not a place that I see myself frequenting when football season isn't in, but I wouldn't steer anyone away, either, as I imagine the positive vibes are a constant at Archie's."}
{"text":"Monday through Thursday 35 cent wings, but there's a catch. You have to buy a drink (I got a 2.50 pop) and 10 wings of one flavor (3.50). Which was fair, but I wish I could've gotten 5 wings in one flavor and 5 in another because it all looked so good! 

We got Spicy Thai, Hot, and Cajun, and I can attest that all of them were fried and slathered to perfection.  Not those dinky wings that other places try and pass off, but real big, juicy, and fried wings."}
{"text":"Kind of a sports-bar atmosphere on a Tuesday night.  Pirates on TV, good beer and wing specials, and some really loud fans.  Great place to hang out and watch a game.  Food is average bar food though, priced okay.  Be sure to look at the specials when u come in so you aren't jacking up your bill unessessarily with your normal draft when you can get blue moons for a buck or two!"}
{"text":"Archie's is a neighborhood favorite of ours.  We love their wings.  They are consistently a good size, crispy, well sauced, and cheap!  We like the Thai, garlic parm, and honey bbq.  The ranch is good as well, even though you have to pay extra for it.

It's a simple, good bar."}
{"text":"Normal sort of South Side divey bar. However, I'm pretty sure they have the best wings deal I've ever seen (feel free to prove me wrong!). there is but one stipulation: you must order a beer/drink with your wings. But come on? Beer is the perfect drink to go with wings. Where they get you though is that it costs at least a dollar to get veggies or dippers."}
{"text":"I definitely did not have a good experience here. I came with my boyfriend to Archie's, it being the first time eating there for both of us- and definitely the last. The bartender noticeably looked like someone pissed in his Cheerios and the ONE waitress working seemed a little irritated, but was nice enough to not be too off putting. We did find it strange however, that she asked us for our IDs even though we stated that neither of us wanted to drink nor were we sitting at the bar. She said \"just incase you change your minds\" um... Ok. She gave us menus and brought our drinks quickly but it took her at least 15 minutes to get back to take our order. However, my boyfriend and I noticed a large group outside and we were chatting and enjoying each other's company so we didn't mind. She took our order and then we waited... And waited... And waited. We sat for over an hour and didn't even get the fried appetizers we ordered. Not only that, but she failed to even come over and give us an update on our order or apologize for the wait. And the place really wasn't too busy. The real kicker was when a women she clearly knew came in and sat down at the bar, she surely found time to stand and chat with her between her duties. As the dining room stared to fill we decided to leave, ten times hungrier than we were when we came in. Never will we ever go back."}
{"text":"\"We came for wings,\" and they were amazing. When we were looking for the best wing spot in Southside, we used the phone-a-friend method, and the call came back to try Archie's, so we made the stop. Skeptical at first since this is very much a bar in the strictest sense of the word. Even Archie himself was a bit suspicious of us as we had a younger child in tow. But they had a somewhat complete menu and separate dining area. As we waited for the food to be prepared our skepticism grew as it seemed to take longer than normal and the single waitress/bartender was distracted waiting on other customers. But when our wings and side dips arrived, we were all lost in heavenly flavors of the best buffalo wings that any of us have experienced previously (or since). The quality of the wings alone clearly made up for any service problems. We had the hot buffalo sauce, and I especially liked it because they were not overly hot and not overly tangy (vinegar flavor).  While we were not here on a \"wing special\" night it was definitely worth coming here just for that."}
{"text":"I don't ever really venture into the Southside because it's not really my cup of tea. Lots of cool shops and things to do but getting there parking or even public transportation is too annoying. It has to be something special for me to head to the Southside.

My partner and I we're going to go to dinner before we headed to a show and we were trying to decide where to go. Do we do something fun and classy and spend maybe a little bit more money than we wanted to? Or do we go and get wings. Of course we decided to go get wings

I'm not saying that we're not classy and we don't like to spend a little bit of money on good food but considering that my graduation was last week saving money on food really was something I need to do. Archie's has delicious food. This was maybe the second time that I've been here and I was really impressed with the size of their wings and with the flavor choices. They had celery and carrots with ranch and blue cheese which is a usual for wings but I found some places that don't offer this on the side.

When looking over the wing choices we decided to order 20 wings, so two orders of 10. Because we got two orders of 10 we were able to get two choices of sauces. If you wanted to split up the orders into more sauces you had to pay extra. We went with a dry Cajun and the honey mustard. Both were delicious. Next time that I would be there I would ask them to throw a little bit more seasoning on the dry Cajun but other than that it was great. The honey mustard was also dripping with sauce just the way I like it. And the cool crunch of those celery and carrot sticks really went above and beyond.

I also ordered a side salad which was huge and only ate about half of it. Sometimes when you're doing fried food for dinner you might want to add a little more vegetables. I probably could have passed. But I will say I did eat that salad the next day.

The staff was really fun and attentive. They made me laugh a lot. I would definitely come back here for wings. I hear that they do have some specials and maybe I'll come back on a day where I can partake in those. Really nice spot with ample seating and my favorite part was you could actually hear the person across the table from you."}
{"text":"This place is great. Has all the games and is very \"out of town\" friendly. $7.25 pitchers of bud light is awesome. Typical bar food but the big draw is the Sunday ticket and pitchers."}
{"text":"Wing night!  AS everyone has already written, Monday thru Thursday $.35.  Have to get 10.  The wings are crisp and tasty.  $3 drafts.  Spent $7.   Service was good and friendly.  This is really a dive bar but a fun place for wings, a draft and a good place to watch some sports on all the TV's."}
{"text":"Another South Side bar, another notch on my South Side bar belt! 

So being that it's a bar located in the great city of Pittsburgh, I expect specials! Really dirt cheap specials is just the icing, or shall we say slightly foamy head, on the beer. 

$2 you call it, or in layman's terms, stick to beer unless you don't mind bottom shelf liquor.  Beggars can't be choosers here! I'll take it!  They had a DELISH Blue Moon Summer Ale on tap that I highly recommend. 

I may be a little bit of a weirdo about this, but once the special began they stopped serving the drafts in glasses and switched to barely 16 oz cups. Boo!  I'm not at a frat party! 

The service is great until it got packed, then you have to start looking really eager for your beer and make direct eye contact or you won't get noticed.  It would help to beef up the bartenders to at least 3 or 4, instead of two swamped girlies. 

A closer look at the specials menu and it looks as if EVERYDAY is $2 drinks.  You call it Friday 10-midnight and Saturday 9-11.  Special bonus on Thursdays $1 Blue Moons from 10-midnight!  Hi new fav cheap place!

$2 dolla make-a you holla! And potentially make you intoxicated."}
{"text":"I live only a few blocks away and just came here for the first time last week. I like dive bars, but for some reason had never been inclined to come in, but my usual Wednesday night place was closed and I decided to check out Archie's. It was definitely better than I had expected - we ordered the Western flatbread and a few plates of wings. The chicken on the flatbread wasn't great but everything else about it was pretty tasty. The wings were also good - and I don't even particularly like wings. Our service was surprisingly good, and everyone was very friendly. I might start saving myself a few blocks and come here on Wednesdays instead."}
