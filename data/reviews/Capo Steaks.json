{"text":"Terrible customer service! Stay far away from this place!!!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I feel pretty bad taking this long to review. I found this place through yelp and wasn't really expecting too much (because the place wasn't looking too hot), but ohmygod. It's great! The food is phenomenal (and at a very reasonable price). The man isn't kidding when he says the cheesesteaks are the best west of Philly. Not only that, but the guy who works there is super friendly and cool. It's like the cherry on top."}
{"text":"Best damn cheese steaks, period!  You will be satisfied. Fries and drinks are included with your meal! The chicken steak is awesome!"}
{"text":"YUMMM. I love hole in the wall restaurants.. There are a lot of places in the hood you might pass on your way to work and never think about.. This is one of them. It's on the corner (in the cut) next to a martial arts dojo. I got the chicken philly. I was bomb!!! Very messy and poorly organized but that is the only reason it doesn't get the last star. Looks aside it tasted great. I'd recommend getting the hot pepper for a (free) added kick. The chicken was juicy and tender so I'll definitely return. Half a sub costs 6 but it come with a drink and fry. They only have three drinks right now so you might want to buy another. Stop by the people who work there are cool and will help you choose what to get or answer any questions you may have !"}
{"text":"I love watching New Day Cleveland and just like any other day im tuning in to it and i see one of their special guest [ the owner of Capos] cooking a philly cheese steak and it looked absolutely delicious and the owner was so confident that once his philly was tried we'd declare it the best in cleveland so i hurried over and graves two one for me and one for who ever else I decided to pay kindness forward to today!...and I must say its amazing just what you expect in a philly cheese steak and the price was dead on 8.99 for a philly whole which is easily a 10 to 12 footer and for a dollar more you gut fresh cut fries and a pop ..ill be having gn got again Thanks Capos"}
{"text":"Really good steaks and award winning service. The cook was working by himself but was courteous and efficient in making food and being a great host."}
