{"text":"What an absolutely fabulous marriage of flavors!   This Cleveland  Warehouse District restaurant is definitely a must-try-at-least-once place. It appears to increase in clientele during the nightclubbing hours, but those who don't at least try a meal here are truly missing out!  I went with one of my dearest friends, who happens to be from Chicago. Read her review above! She ordered the Pan Seared Scallops and Risotto and would not stop eating until her plate was clean! I ordered the Perogies and Sausage, just an exquisite surprise at the burst of flavors!   I must recommend the Mangoesintoabar for something to drink. Wonderful! The wine was also nice, though the selection could be better. The bartender, however, knows his stuff! After one glass of wine, he knew which wines to recommend and which ones I wouldn't like (I was able to taste test just to make sure).   The only qualm I have with Jac's is that the service wasn't the best. I'm not sure if many people just requested off, but it appeared that the waitstaff weren't people who normally wait on tables, as there were small spills that took a while to clean up.   Overall, I will definitely go back! I 100% recommend this restaurant for anyone looking for a trendy, New American style restaurant!"}
{"text":"Meh.  Stumbled across this bar when almost getting trampled over while walking through some crazy festival downtown.  Our bartender was the worse! He didnt know how to make a long island, and took about 10 minutes to make it wrong. Expensive...Expensive...Expensive.  Warning: Check your beer bottles when ordering.  We found some nasty white pieces of something at the bottom of one Heineken bottle, and another bottle of beer was water NOT beer. Shady people at this bar open up bottles and fill them with water...Beware ! We complained to the manager and they played stupid and just offered us another drink.  It was nice to have a spot to drink outside, but the services was awful."}
{"text":"Or-frickin-gasmic!!! Located in the heart of the Warehouse District in downtown Cleveland, this trendy restaurant (turned night/dance club at night on the weekends) has absolutely wonderful food!  While visiting one of my best friends in Cleveland, we went out to dinner at Jac's - and stayed for 4.5 hrs! Since I could go on-and-on about this place, let me highlight what we ordered and recommend.  Drinks Mangoesintoabar (pronounced Mangoes in to a bar - clever right?!) - delicious, refreshing drink ($9) Berry Mojito - not my favorite, but okay ($8) Great selection of wine - my friend can comment on this better than I can  Appetizer Fried Mozzarella patties - average (but how can you make this outstanding?), nice presentation  Meals!!!!! Pan Seared Scallops and Risotto - I am still dreaming and wishing I could order and eat this now. Beautiful presentation; risotto was cooked just right over a bed of spinach; scallops ( 6 large pieces) cooked to perfection ($19) Perogies and Sausage - My friend swears that this is the best fusion of flavors and I believe her. *Note: You will not find these entries on their Web site; the Web site needs to be updated.  Ambiance was perfect - nice modern/contemporary feel. Music was top 40's - nice choice for dinner right before going out. Wait staff (well tonight it was apparently the bartender) was attentive and very knowledgeable.  For those of you that only know Jac's for the night club/dance club, you are missing out! The food here is fantastic. I would frequent this place once a week if I didn't live in Chicago!!"}
