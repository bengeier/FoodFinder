{"text":"This is an excellent Caribbean restaurant. Menu items have been thoughtfully updated. Vegetarian options are delicious. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"jerk chicken falls off the bone and the seasoning is perfect. a bit pricey but worth every penny."}
{"text":"If you like contrasting flavours nab the plantain poutine and douse it in Lloyadie's homemade hot sauce (I personally mixed in all three) to get a heavenly medley of tastes. Their fries are crispy fresh, the plantain adds a delightful sweetness and the hot sauce elevates the experience to a whole new level. And if you appreciate spice as much as I do, you can also walk away with any of the three hot sauces, which are beautifully packaged."}
{"text":"Very nice staff and amazing food.
We had the chicken sandwich , jerk chicken, chicken and beef patty and the Mac and cheese . Everything was amazing . 

My favorite is the beef patty. I really love that the sauce are on the side so we can try different ones. I really like the mango one and the mild one: the rice is also very good and the whole meal feel very fresh . 

I can't wait to go back, the only downside is that there not a lot of places to sit in the restaurant but Lloydie's is truly one of my favorite restaurant in the city ! 

Long life to them !!!"}
{"text":"I work nearby Lloydies and it has established itself as an outstanding addition to an already strong lineup of restaurants in the St-Viateur area.

If you're looking for something that feels like it's something your grandma made (assuming grandma was from the Carribean) Lloydies is the place for you.

At the very least, get one of the patties that put the Lloydies name on the map."}
{"text":"Caribbean food 5 minutes away from my house. Great idea! 

They have macaroni pie.... MACARONI PIE! It's basically macaroni and cheese but they make it in this pot so it's like upwards macaroni. It keeps its shape. It's delicious. Finally, a place I can get macaroni and cheese for 4$ and in less than 4 minutes.

They also have their own Montréal made soda!  hibiscus , bark, and ginger flavoured. I got to sample them but I'm really not a soda person. They aren't fizzy and the hibiscus one is really sweet!

I tried their jerk fries(4$) and their chicken patty. I really enjoyed both. The spices in their jerk sauce is just spicy enough that I can tolerate it( meaning I taste how spicy it is but I can still discern flavour). 
Their chicken patty is so goooooood. I had yet to find a good chicken patty and they made the perfect one. A bit on the pricier side than most other patty's out there(3$), but worth it! 

Prices on the menu include tax. 

The place is really small so be prepared to get your order to go unless there's no one there. 
It's really nicely decorated! They have these cute stools, some books you can browse, a neon fish thing, and a section in the far back of the restaurant where you can sit with a buddy and talk to the cooks. Oh and they also have a small section where you can eat standing up(I love eating standing up)

The staff is also so nice!!!! I can't wait to explore their menu this week!"}
{"text":"This place was phenomenal. We shared the jerk chicken and it was SO GOOD. Every morsel was delicious. And they have Ting! 

They also mentioned they have a sample plate to share that has all of the other menu items. We didn't have enough room in our stomachs but have nothing but regret since for not ordering that. All of their food looked so good. 

Oh, and all their sauces are tasty too. And the place was clean and everyone was friendly and nice. Great, great place."}
{"text":"New Caribbean restaurant in Mile End. Great authentic food. As a Trini I am always skeptical of Caribbean restaurants. This one delivers. Ginger beer, sorrel, patties, macaroni pie, jerk chicken all are excellent. Great place. Happy they are here."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place wandering around mile end. This place is amazing. If I could give it six stars I would. Service is amazing. The food is amazing. The man behind the counter gave us local tips for other places to eat. Wow could not ask for a better experience!!!!"}
{"text":"Located right in the middle of the very hipster Mile-End area on St-Viateur street, this place aims to serve great Caribbean food. Being kinda not dressed like the crowd of the area, I felt kinda out of place, but that doesn't matter.

Went there on a weekday evening with a friend for dinner. Curious from their offerings and having never tasted Carribean food before in my life, I was more than curious.

The decor inside was nice and the vibe from the employees was great as well. Going inside the restaurant, you will make your order then move along to collect your order. The seating area is fairly scant, with about enough seats for a dozen people (although most of the customers seemed to be locals coming for take-out). 

I decided to go for their plate of jerk chicken. It cost about 15$ (iirc) and came with a side of fries, rice, cucumber salad, and fried plantains. I started with the cucumber salad, which was not so great, unfortunately. It was way too acid to my taste. The main plate itself, however, was good. The spices of the chicken were well mixed, with enough taste. Unfortunately, considering my low tolerance for spices, I had some difficulty (my problem). The sides also were good, with the fries well seasoned too. 

Bottomline, nice place for lunch or dinner. Would recommend if you are craving chicken but want it done differently!"}
{"text":"I don't typically review places but Lloydie's is special.  The food is absolutely incredible.  Had the Jerk Chicken and Fried chicken special.  The house sauces and homemade sodas are delicious as well.  The staff were super nice and welcoming."}
{"text":"So happy to have a new Caribbean place near me with delicious vegetarian options! We shared the vegetarian plate, the mac and cheese and the veggie patty. All was delish but the veggie plate was the best, we agreed we'd be back often for this filling dish, it's so awesome to get a big pile of food with proteins and starches and spices and full flavour that's veg, so many places can't seem to manage this. The beans and rice were sooo good, the plantains were perfect for my taste, sweet and crispy and not soaked in grease, and still hefty and filling. And the salad that came with it all included these lightly pickled cucumbers that were the perfect balance to the rest. 

We tried the jerk and the red hot sauces since our gentlemanly waiter gave us a thorough introduction, we like hot sauce and can handle spicy but all the sauces here are made with scotch bonnets, so even the 'mild' red sauce is pretty intense. Loved it. 

The veg patty is actually vegan which is so rare, a great snack to go if you're in the area. And the mac and cheese was highly decadent, a little rich for me but excellent when cut with the red sauce. All in all we ate super well for $18 and loved the warm and chill, well-decorated ambiance. 

Also huge appreciation for the bio-degradable containers. 

There are so many shitty things opening in this beloved area, it's nice to see someone come in with something cool and friendly and thoughtful, and at a price point suited to the locals. Wish them everything good."}
{"text":"I ordered with Uber eats .. the food was terrible I had to throw it in the garbage .. I ordered the jerk chicken poutine and the vegetarian Pattie .. the chicken tasted terrible .. the jerk sauce seemed uncooked and tasteless .. and the Pattie had no taste .. will never order again"}
{"text":"Jerk sandwich was very tasty, but there wasn't much chicken. A little dry too. I'd still go back though! Maybe it was on off day."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of trying this spot in the Mile end area for lunch today and I was so excited to do so. Aside from the friendly service there food really packs a punch, we took a few Jamaican patties, a jerk chicken poutine and a jerk chicken sandwich to share.

The patties were warm and flaky and the filling was some flavourful beef with a hint of spice, I would have liked it more spicy. The jerk poutine was phenomenal, perfect balance of spice from the jerk blend compliments the delicious gravy and fries. The jerk chicken sandwich was also good, I particularly enjoyed the bread they used, it must have been a corn bread, it was delicious. I would definitely go back and try there other specialties like oxtail and there deserts! Give this place a try, support some of the best jerk in the city!"}
{"text":"This review is for both locations, St-Viateur and Crescent.
O.M.G.
When I was in highschool, we had the best spicy beef patties and ever since then, nothing have come close. And Lloydie's patties, I am almost sure now are the same ones we had in school (because apparently they used to deliver to highschools in MTL)

Wednesday, I realized by accident that a restaurant was in the Mile-End so my friend and I immediately came in to get patties. I went from getting one to 2. She did the same. An hour later we came back because she wanted more. I was told that they have opened the one on Crescent so the next day, Thursday, I brought a few more friends and had a sit-down lunch.

I LOVE how both restos are decorated. You can immediately feel the good vibe when you walk in. The staff is so nice, friendly and attentive. Most of us took the jerk plates and everything was delicious. I even had leftover for lunch today, Friday. 3 days in a row and I'm not even mad.

I would definitely come back here. Go!"}
{"text":"Fave Caribbean in town, awesome service, best patties ever!! Don't write it off as some new hipster place, it's deeply rooted in the Montreal community (the owner's Dad has been selling patties across Montreal for 30 years), and I feel so lucky they chose to set up their brick and mortar down the street from where I live. I'm typing this as I wait for my to go order of jerk pork and jerk chicken for my partner and macaroni pie, but believe me it's not a long wait (mayyyyybe 5 minutes?)!"}
{"text":"I've lived in the area my entire life and the only jerk spot around has always been Caraïbe Delite on Parc. So when news hit that a new jerk restaurant would be opening up in the area, my family and I were very excited.

I finally had the time to go one weekend, and the co-owner served me at the counter - really sweet, enthusiastic guy. I was told that they made a lot of their product in house including traditional beverages. Samples offered and taken. My expectations were high because of this.

If I hadn't had time to people watch while my plate was being prepared, I wouldn't have realized that you need to choose a sauce to go with your chicken. I figured, maybe I'm just accustomed to super saucy, Guyanese style jerk à la Caraïbe Delite?  I also took a jamaican pattie to go, and ate it on my walk home. One bite in and I was unimpressed, because not only did it smell freezer burnt, but it was actually burnt on the bottom side.  I still had hopes that the plates I purchased would be tasty, though. When I got home, the food had cooled down a bit, and before plating it to reheat, I took a bite to see if it needed salt. My initial realization was had I not taken any side sauces, I honestly would have been left with a few over priced, under seasoned roasted chicken legs, because the rice in my plates was old. Sour smelling - the rice had gone rancid. Not acceptable to serve that to customers. And finally, my experience with the macaroni pie was also underwhelming; just a congealed square of macaroni with little to no seasoning. 
Glad I only brought home 1 piece. 

I must note, that this experience was early on, about a month after they opened. Does that make a difference? I'm unsure."}
{"text":"Went here 10 days after it opened for lunch. The place was packed, and yet, the staff managed it well! 

There is a place to stand up and eat, or a booth. You may want to plan to take to go if you are going at peek hours. 

Extremely affordable! All portions are large! To try!

In the first few days of opening they have let people sample their coconut loaf and their juices, and they are great! I really enjoyed the hibiscus flavor. They have a ton of fun spicy sauces for you to try out as well. Sauces available for purchase, could even be a fun present!

The shop is super well designed! 

Between my colleagues and I, we have now tried everything on the menu! Our favs included:
-veggie plate
-jerk chicken sandwich (okay to get spicy, it isn't thattttt spicy ;) ) (messy!!)
-poutine (their fries are off the hook!!!!) 
-chicken patty
-macaroni and cheese pie (duh!) at $4 this is a steal!!
-cucumber salad to cool it all off!"}
