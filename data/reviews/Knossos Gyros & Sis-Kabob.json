{"text":"I stopped here and ordered a regular gyro and a spicy one for my husband.  I was in the neighborhood watching my Grandson so I called ahead and walked down to pick up our order.  The place was a tad run down and nothing fancy, but the staff was very friendly and welcoming upon my arrival.  From the time I called until I walked out the door with my food it was approximately 20min. *this on a Saturday night.  Walked the 7 min back to my daughters place and the food was still hot.  Both gyros seasoned and cooked perfectly. The fresh toppings of onions, lettuce,and tomatoes were complemented by the tastiest tzatiki sauce I've ever had... And the amount didn't overpower the gyros but enhanced them!  All in all I say who cares about the no frills ambiance when the food is this tasty!  A word on value.... 2 LG gyros.. Average size for about 14.00.  A place worth checking out!"}
{"text":"I'm underwhelmed. Being a Mike & Tonys kind of girl, I was not really expecting a whole lot. But this meal left me feeling totally \"meh\". I've personally made better tzatziki sauce before. Their gyro meat has some flavor but it's way too salty for me. I give it a 3 purely for the fact that their staff is helpful and super nice. That always makes a difference to me. Still it is not going to be enough to make me want to go back. I'm sticking with my original choice!"}
{"text":"I'm originally from Pittsburgh and was in for a visit this past week.  My fianc√© and I stopped in Knossos tonight before out departure, was craving a gyro.  I went with the Buffalo chicken dip, which was fabulous.  Stephanie, who was very friendly and knowledgeable of the menu was great.  She truly helped out with our dining experience.  We also had couple gyros, to satisfy my craving!   Next time we are back in the burgh we will for sure swing by!  Hope to see Stephanie again, she was awesome!"}
{"text":"Before I start with the negatives, I used to get gyros from here when I first moved to Dormont about a year ago. I loved it. However it's gone downhill fast. I ordered a small gyro and onion rings. The onion rings were burned and disgusting. There wasn't even onion in the rings! It was a small stale piece of who knows. It's like they buy them frozen and they are freezer burned. The small gyro was mostly lettuce. Not much meat. The meat that was in there was bland, cold and didn't taste good.  There are many places around that sell other food including gyros. Knossos cannot even compete with the others. The inside is also run down, and dirty. There was loud music playing and I wasn't even greeted when I walked in. I was stared at, then he put his head down and didn't say anything for 5 minutes. Awkward! Took 15 minutes to make my food when I was the only customer. Overall, I am very disappointed and will not be going back."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Delivery was late, our gyros were cold and fries were soggy. I wont be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"I have some errands that I run in Dormont every Monday. When I finish the errands I stop at Knossos every week to pick up a couple of Gyros to go for my girlfriend and I. It seems to be a good, old fashioned, family run business. The food is always good as is the service. It's somethng we look forward to. As a matter of fact, when I headed out the door last Monday my sweetie remarked, \"It's Knossos day, cool!\""}
{"text":"Hummus is very good. Not a place you'd want to \"go out\" for dinner but great for a quick bite to eat. Would go there again."}
{"text":"We stopped here for a quick dinner before an appointment. I had a gyro and it was good. I personally preferred Mike & Tony's to this one, but would eat here again.  My wife really enjoyed the buffalo chicken gyro and is the reason I am giving 4 stars. I was going to go with 3 but changed to 4 based on her and my daughters opinion of this place.  The servive was so friendly here."}
{"text":"This place has THE WORST customer relations I've experienced in Pittsburgh since I moved here two months ago. My boyfriend was about to order a gyro, I was waiting for him at the table outside near the street with a drink and hotdog I had gotten elsewhere, there was absolutely no one else in their establishment. The person behind the counter then told my boyfriend that I was not welcome to sit at their outdoor seating area with him while he enjoyed his gyro. He canceled his order and we sat at the friendly place next door. Not only did Knossos lose my boyfriend's business that day, but they also lost both of us as future customers. What a petty and pathetic place."}
{"text":"Ordered the pierogie gyro, and thought that it was really good.  The gyro meat was cut fresh from the cone, and spiced very well.  The perogie was also really good. I will definitely go back and try some of their other dishes, or just to get a really good gyro again."}
{"text":"I got the normal gyro and the girlfriend got mildly adventurous with the buffalo chicken gyro.  Mine was STUFFED with meat to the point where there was hardly anything else on it, which was good enough for me, though I can imagine some people might want more tzatziki/onions and such.   Hers was \"meh,\" the one thing she said about it was \"Well, it's not really a gyro.\"  Fairly cozy and diner-esque on the inside"}
{"text":"Drove 1/2 hr to find this spot in the snow.  Had a great dinner.  Polish platters split by 3 of us and we were stuffed!!!!  Also had a small gyro for our daughter.  The food was so good and filling we had to bring 2 of the stuffed cabbage home.  Definitely recommend it for someone hankering for Polish home cooking specialties."}
{"text":"Never ever again will I go here. The carpet is filthy needs cleaned or replaced!!! The walls need a fresh coat of paint. The place just doesn't seem clean to eat. I ordered hummus and pita bread it came to $8.54???? It didn't seem like it was made fresh! Too over priced. I got a cup of hummus and 4 pita breads. Just god awful!!! I'll go to amels from now on. at least I know that at amels the people take pride in their food."}
{"text":"This place has a lot of different food to choose from.  Don't let the sketchy exterior and interior scare you away because they have great food.  Their gyros are wonderful and they have the best tzatziki sauce I have ever tasted.  They also have different things like Buffalo chicken dip and even a Buffalo chicken gyro."}
{"text":"We had food delivered to our house last night from Knossos. I tried their pierogi which I found to be quite good. Also tasty are their broccoli bites and their huge ice cream sandwiches (homemade). Very recommended!"}
{"text":"I will admit; I am a sucker for any and all Polish foods. As a kid, my choice of a birthday dinner would always be my Mom's stuffed cabbage with sauerkraut (weird, I know!).  Living in Dormont for almost 2 years, I finally decided to try Knossos Gyros to satisfy my craving for homemade Polish food.  Of course as this was my first time, my boyfriend and I HAD TO GET the Polish Platter, which is a sampler of all of their top Polish foods: kielbasa & sauerkraut sandwich, haluski, stuffed cabbages (golabki), and pierogies. I must say I was very impressed. Although the pierogies needed to cook a bit longer (the dough was a bit tough), everything else was piping hot and delicious. Our favorite was the kielbasa sandwich. A close second was the haluski (definitely a comfort food and not for the health conscious)!   The Polish platter is a little costly but you really get a ton of food for the price & I think it is enough for 2 people (with a normal appetite) to share.   We also tried out the buffalo chicken dip as this is our favorite thing to make for a party and wanted to see how theirs measured up. It was delicious and not too spicy. It was accompanied by a small bag of soft pita triangles for scooping up the dip which is different than I'm used to but was definitely a great switch-up to make it more their own.  I look forward to trying their gyros (in the near future)!"}
{"text":"Such good Pierogi and cabbage rolls! The staff was hospitable, prices great! Lots of dessert options to- if you leave hungry it is your own fault."}
{"text":"The food is NOT what it used to be, less than stellar and way over priced!!   Not the place I remember, super gyro (was ok) pizza boat ($11.50 for a mediocre under cooked pizza boat??) fried mushrooms (were tasty) and a small chicken salad with fermented olives=$30?? Wow!!! Me and 2 children could have walked around the corner to eat n park and had a better experience, and that's what I recommend you do.   I don't like to bash food joints but I won't be back!  I'm not hard to please, just make it tasty and give me some value."}
{"text":"As I mentioned in a previous review, Knossos also serves pierogi, and what delightfully doughy, spud-packed parcels of pleasure they are. Knossos doesn't serve them with mere sour cream, but rather, tzatziki sauce, the every same topping used on their fine, fine gyros.   And they deliver to Beechview! Praise be to the Gods!"}
{"text":"Decent product but very slow. Even tried calling ahead my second time there and I arrived at the time quoted, they began assembling the order and still took 15 minutes. Take it or leave it."}
{"text":"This was probably the worst Gyro I have ever had.  Even the frozen ones sold in supermarkets are better than this.  Extremely dry, tasteless, and obviously not fresh as I watched the woman cut from the very top of the thin spindly piece of meat left and then microwave it before serving me.  I will never go back to this place nor will I recommend it.   Stay away, Gross and distasteful"}
{"text":"The Burgh's best gyros! Don't expect a fancy atmosphere and you won't be disappointed. Cheap eats and a diner-like atmosphere. They even deliver!"}
{"text":"Honestly, it's pretty unassuming from the outside. Inside it's a tiny greek diner, albeit some \"Americanized\" choices on the menu. Hello buffalo chicken gyro!  But if you are craving for a fixin' of some stuffed cabbage, potato pierogies, or halushki, this is your place. And for dirt cheap too. I think our total bill was like $10.   Obviously you'll get the traditional gyro's here as well, with the twist of the buffalo chicken one. Obviously, I'm intrigued. They also sell ice cream, which if I wasn't so full from my meal, I definitely would have indulged in!"}
{"text":"Best gryos in Pittsburgh in a little shop with a lot of Pittsburgh flavor! Potomac is street parking with meters, so it can be a little hit or miss sometimes, but mostly its not an issue. They do delivery, always have a game on in the shop and are super friendly. :)"}
