{"text":"We went today for my dad's bday. Was our first time at Bamboo House. The food was overall good,  the duck seemed like little old or left over, just a piece. My chicken fried rice was good, the poo poo tray acceptable too. The service super good. Definitely we will return."}
{"text":"Great dinner food was hot and tasty.   Richard our server was very efficient and friendly.   Great service."}
{"text":"As a European, I have a love of curry that I've had trouble filling in Phoenix so far, but Bamboo House's shrimp curry with fried rice hit the spot. I'll definitely be back! The crab puffs were yummy too!"}
{"text":"This was my favorite Chinese restaurant in the area but it is now under new ownership and the food is mediocre.  It is sad that the new ownership has greatly compromised the quality of a quality restaurant that has been part of the community for decades."}
{"text":"Still trying to find the best chinese in Phoenix as this one is just okay. Nothing too special to write about. Take out is good but dining in is better. Food is a little Pricey. All in all I would recommend for a lunch spot rather than dinner. They do have good drinks"}
{"text":"How can you not love a place that has $3.50 drinks with umbrellas and fruit garnishes and the best cocktail sign ever?! I have only ordered the drinks, the chicken wings and the pad Thai and I loved them all. So far, this is my favorite pad Thai in the valley. My husband likes Pei Wei's version better, which I don't understand . I order mine not too spicy here, because otherwise it is quite spicy!"}
{"text":"I have been eating here since they opened 10 years ago. Very good consistent food at an amazing value. The owner Sam is there most of the time and takes good care of his diners most of whom are neighborhood regulars. We get take out from here every week and have tried most of what is on menu at least once. If you are unsure what to order definitely consider the various family  dinner options and come hungry. Easy parking, full bar, simple neighborhood place with emphasis on food not décor."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: San Fran refugee.  

Think most densely populated Chinatown in US.  What's with the all the pink plastic bags floating everywhere, anyway?  It's like the intro to American Beauty.  But, I digress.

I have eaten Dim Sum/Cantonese, Szechuan, and Shanghai-style Chinese food in most cosmopolitan cities, and had a Taiwanese girlfriend in college who could cook.  So my judgement is going to be rough on any Chinese restaurant.

Ready?

Bamboo house is fine.  No fanfare.  Pleasant, very fast service, and hot food.  I am very happy with the Singapore noodles.  Perfectly curried and spicy.  The Moo shui pork is good.  Some of the other sauces are waaaay bland and greasy, but that is what most Chinese think us honkies want.

Now, that wasn't too bad was it?  You thought I was going to be more scathing and critical.  Sorry if I let you down.  I'll dig up someplace that deserves some harshing on."}
{"text":"Great food and great service!  Enjoy this neighborhood restaurant.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"Incredible.  Been there a few times.  Went there for my birthday.  Crab rangoons and Lobster Szechuan are favorites"}
{"text":"First off, I really hate to have to write a bad review for any restaurant and it pains me to have to do this for Bamboo House.  I have been coming to Bamboo House for over 13 years, it used to be some of the best Chinese food I had ever been able to find in Phoenix.  Sam and family retired a few years back and sold it to a woman and I do not know her name because she is not as friendly as Sam and his family were.  Initially under new ownership the menu and food had remained pretty much the same and much of the original staff appeared to have stayed on.  All was still pretty good up until about 8 months ago.  The quality of food started to change and they started to give you less.  I used to order take out from there almost once a week and the take out portions were becoming smaller and smaller and the quality of the food overall has become very poor.  Items were forgotten from my order, half the pu pu tray missing, not enough rice or no rice at all, etc...And then the service started to go way down hill.  Every time I would order take out they would tell me 15-20 minutes but I ended up waiting 20-30 minutes when I arrived to pick up my food.  So I would add time and arrive later and my food was still never ready.  They were not even starting my order until I got there which completely defeats the purpose of calling it in in advance.  Then came the rude treatment from the new owner woman who would yell at me from the kitchen too bad they were busy my order is not ready do I still want it.  Then I also observed that the staff had completely turned over except for one person who was there with Sam and family.  And rightfully so because the new owner does nothing but scream and yell at her staff and I had witnessed this behavior every single time I was in there for the last 8 months.  No wonder everyone quit, she would scream and yell at them like a maniac.  Last time I ordered take out was on 12/22/15 and I will not be going back.  Besides being yelled at by the owner because she had not started my order, I had to stand there for over 40 minutes to wait for it while observing her screaming and yelling at her staff.  When I expressed my disappointment and that I am a 13 year customer there almost once a week for that duration, she did not care, she was nasty and rude.  Then when I got the food home the Orange Chicken container was half full and the egg rolls were soggy and way too greasy.  I unfortunately will not be returning as a Bamboo House customer, the service is horrible and the food is no longer good and they cheat you.  It make me sad but this new owner has ruined a really great Chinese Food restaurant :("}
{"text":"I've been coming here for over 10 years and will freak out if this place ever closes (don't see that happening!). Best lunch specials ever. I took my office buddies here for lunch a year ago and most of them have been coming back on their own time. For less than $6, a good lunch combo special includes hot tea, fried rice, wontons, a generous entree, and soup of the day (either hot & sour, or egg drop depending on the day). I have never waited more than 10 minutes for lunch to come out. I'd say they average 5 minutes. I recommend Mongolian beef entree. They also make *amazing* egg foo yong- best I've ever had. They do not cook with MSG. Service is friendly. Sam, the owner, is there almost all of the time and always says hello."}
{"text":"Meh, I've experienced better, pretty much covers it.

The young man who brought water and tea didn't know what tea he was serving us. No straws were brought- big peeve of mine. I dislike drinking from cups at restaurants.

The egg rolls tasted of perfume. Chicken chow mien was ok, $5.95 for M-F lunch special. They never asked if we wanted desert."}
{"text":"I love their lunch specials! They are affordable, delicious, and come with soup and an  egg roll and hot tea. This has been my favorite Chinese food place since I was a kid. Their house special chicken is to die for! I am always greeted politely and within seconds of coming in the door. I have never had bad service here."}
{"text":"In my ongoing search to find non-horrible Chinese food near me, I discovered this little place up by Thunderbird and was very encouraged by reading the reviews. I'm a big fan of hot and sour soup, so to see multiple yelpers talking about how this place's soup was like taking your tastebuds on a trip to tastebud Disneyland, I got all excited. It was OK, but suffice it to say, the search goes on.

When the hot and sour soup arrived at our table, I think I might have literally started shaking in anticipation. It was rich and overstuffed with all the things one expects to find in hot and sour soup. It looked absolutely fabulous, brimming with fat shrimp and chicken chunks. It tasted absolutely fabulous. One curious... well, no TWO curious things about it though. Like most other hot and sour soups I've found around the Valley, it was neither particularly hot nor particularly sour. Chinese restaurants, I ask you - can you not read? HOT and SOUR soup, dare I say it, needs to be HOT and also SOUR. The soup was so delicious, however, that I forgave it, asked its hand in marriage and we have been living ever since in my parents' basement. Seriously, a touch more rice vinegar and hot chili oil and I'd have gone for more than the justice of the peace.

I had the Pad Thai, a touch dry but absolutely delicious. Not spicy enough for my outrageous palate, but then again, little is. At least it had real kick to it, more than you can say for a lot of Chinese places. My wife (not the soup, the real one - we got married last week, yay us) had the sweet and sour chicken, which was competent. The eggrolls were fine, but the crab puffs were too stingy on the filling. 

As others have noted, the service is top notch, very friendly. The place itself is the typical Chinese-kitsch, you're not exactly straying off the Chinese Restaurant Playbook here. The bathrooms though - holy tiny spaces, Batman! I walked in and a guy was there doing his business and we were so close that by the time we left I had discovered his deepest darkest secrets via osmosis. He fights crime at night, that guy."}
{"text":"This place wasn't bad at all.  Full menu, full bar, and nice waiter.

The food was average, it wasn't bad by any means but was not GREAT.  The sweet and sour soup was delicious I can eat that all day.  I ordered the Teriyaki, I know, unoriginal but thats how i can gage a place, i'll get some pepper beef the next time i'm there.

The lunch specials are well priced, under $6, and you get soup and egg roll.  I will most likely eat here again."}
{"text":"This is my neighborhood chinese food stop. I don't go here often for two reasons... Their lunch is SUPER cheap and I am never home for lunch. And, their food is very salty. I like their food plenty, but dude tone down the sodium! The soups are tasty and the house chicken is good. I keep going back because it is in the neighborhood and it is cheap. 

So, in conclusion, if you are looking for a cheap chinese lunch this is the place. Just realize, it is just a cheap chinese lunch, not fine dining."}
{"text":"Beware of the fried rice!  
This place is in my neighborhood and one weeknight in March we went for the first time when family was visiting. We ordered fried dumplings to start, sautéed green beans, double sautéed sliced pork, beef with broccoli and chicken with mixed vegetables with an order of steamed rice for the table. I must say we all thoroughly enjoyed our food! I didn't care for the pork, thought it was too \"porky\" but everyone else liked it so I'm the outlier.  The woman manager/owner comes up to us at the end, asks us how we liked our meal. I tell her we really enjoyed it, we live in the neighborhood and we'd definitely be coming back. Then this is where it went south. She asked us if we'd like boxes for our leftovers and we were debating whether to take the steamed rice. She says she can give us a carton of steamed rice packaged already and my husband says that if we take rice, we'd just take our leftover from the table rather than the carton she was offering.  \"We wouldn't want it to go to waste and take new rice.\"  Her reply??? \"Oh that doesn't go to waste, we use for something else.\" Oh really?? My husband asks what it is used for and I'm not joking...she replied  \"We use that for fried rice\". We were speechless. And just so there is no confusion about what rice she was talking about, that we are absolutely clear we were talking about the half eaten rice ON our table she says, pointing to the bowl on our table, \"see, it's like nobody really touches it anyway.\"  I'm not joking. We left absolutely devastated! And though I really liked the food, I will not eat here again and cannot recommend it to anyone else. There are basic minimums I expect from a restaurant I patronize and reusing leftovers from the table is outrageous and unacceptable.  So sad."}
{"text":"I'm sorry to say that I'm not impressed with Bamboo House.  They're friendly and the takeout wait isn't long (I haven't dined in), but their food is pretty mediocre.  The first time I visited, I ordered the eggplant with garlic sauce.  It was a little bit bland and rather greasy.  Edible but not something I would order again. 

A week later, I decided to give them a second try, and ordered vegetable spring rolls and orange flavor tofu.  The spring rolls were actually pretty good - fresh, crispy and flavorful.  However, the orange tofu was terrible.  The tofu was soggy (bleh!) and the sauce tasted rather like the sweet and sour sauce they provided to go with the eggrolls - good enough for dipping appetizers in but terrible when your entree is smothered in it.  I couldn't even finish the dish and ended up throwing it away which is a first for me. :(  I won't be going to Bamboo House a third time."}
{"text":"The good: it's cheap and the service was great. The bad: I'm still not sure if I was eating chicken...

I ordered the Chicken Chow Mein in hopes of receiving a dish so good my guilt for ordering it would disappear into a plate of fresh and flavorful noodles; however, the so-called \"Chicken Chow Mein\" from Bamboo House left me regretting every decision I ever made that afternoon. (I'm still not sure if it was chicken I was eating.) The fried rice tasted like old burnt leftovers - my lover and I kept imagining the food coming from the frozen section at your local grocery store. Unfortunately, I think the frozen section would have better prepared food than this place. 

I hate writing bad reviews because it's the death of restaurants, but when the food tastes like leftovers from the patrons of last nights dinner rush - and by rush I mean 6 people - and the chicken is so questionable that you contemplate drinking toilet water so the possibility of throwing up is higher, you have to share the bad news."}
{"text":"Pretty good joint, reminiscent of my go-to place back home. Not gourmet; sesame chicken and lo-mein are pretty good, but not consistently."}
{"text":"Try the moo shu pork!!  It's great to watch the staff wrap each roll using chop sticks. Such skill. I have none!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a good Chinese place with a homey feel that has a kitchen that won't scare you, this is your place. All the makings of a \"neighborhood\" staple without the corporate feel. We brought some out of town relatives here and were pleasantly surprised by the massive menu with seemingly endless choices of all different varieties and styles of Chinese food. K and I were both surprised that when we ordered \"spicy as you make it\" they actually accommodated us but with real skill. Not the just dumping spices into a dish and over-powering the meal, but actually cooking the spices into the meal so that it had plenty of heat but still the taste the recipe calls for. Only thing preventing 5 stars is the menu was so large that we haven't had enough time to give it a good sample. I can say that all 5 of our guests loved the food, the price was very reasonable, and the staff friendly. A sure hit and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"It was my second time ordering take out from their. The first time was great and we really enjoyed which breaks my heart to write a bad review. I couldn't even believe how night and day the food was. The house chicken was over fried, greasy and rubbery. Not even edible, just disgusting. The sweet and sour chicken was hideous, chicken was way over fried and dry . The vegetables weren't even cooked , I've never seen onions so raw. The crab puffs were cold in the middle and undercooked.  Im writing this review in hopes that the criticism will change things around so the consistency of food is the same every time."}
{"text":"I easily could have died here!

I went here on 4/1/15 for lunch mid-afternoon with my brother. I had seen this place in the neighborhood many times and was looking forward to trying it. 

We had a milk toast greeting from the only server there, the place was dead. We sat down and ordered. 

We ordered the Egg drop soup for two, Pork Egg Rolls and our entrees, I ordered the \"Happy Family\" and my brother ordered something with duck. 

The Egg Drop soup was weird. it came with vegetables and tofu in it. I have never seen that done before. The tofu was not appealing. As for the Egg Roll, it was dry, cold and bland. 

The big moment comes and our entree's arrive, My \"Happy Family\" looks and smells good. I was about two bites in and I had ingested something I should not have. It felt like I had swallowed a small zipper or fish spine. I had tried to fish it out with my fingers before it got to far down my throat but I Could not reach it. Then suddenly it was blocking my airway and I could not breath. I jumped up out of our booth and tried to heave it out. I could not get it out. My brother started slamming on my back and after a few minutes of extremely strained breathing we got the forging object past my airway and into the middle of my throat. Finally I could breath, but it hurt and I could not talk. I started drinking lots of water at a rapid pace in an attempt to get the item out. The water caused me to vomit, luckily my brother had grabbed a trash can and set it in our booth so I did not make a mess. the item was still stuck in there good.

Wile I was busy fighting for air my brother had paid the bill and when he returned we left. We went back to my house a few blocks away and for the next hour I drank plenty of fluids to try to dislodge the item. the entire time I could not talk. My brother wanted me to try to vomit again to dislodge the item but I was afraid because I did not want the item to once again block my airway. That was way to scary to repeat. We where about to give up and go to the emergency room when I thought maybe drinking some Olive Oil would help lubricate my throat and get the item to pass. I slowly took a shot of straight olive oil, about have a shot glass full. man, that was disgusting. 

About 5 minutes after taking the olive oil shot, we where heading out the door to go to the ER and suddenly I needed to vomit. I ran to the kitchen sink and it all came flying out. Along with tons of water, what little I had had of my lunch and some of that mornings bagel was a jagged two inch long piece of metal, probably aluminum or tin. It' was stringy, jagged and shaped somewhat like a fish hook. My best guess is it was debris from the can opener or other kitchen hardware or packing material. 

Suddenly I could talk and fully breath normally again. The color started to return to my face and I went from scared to pissed. We put the scrap of metal that came out of my throat in a zip lock bag and hoped back into the truck, returned to Bamboo House to show the people there.

We walked in, My brother showed our server (the only guy there, middle aged white dude.)  the metal in the Ziploc bag and he explained how we had gotten it out. The only thing the server said to us was \"Oh, I will have to look into that\" I then pipped up, \"Can you at least refund him for the meal you made him pay for?\" the guy says nothing, goes to his register and processes the refund. That's it, that's the end of it. Then we turned and left. 

So, In summery. The food that did not almost kill me was sub par at best. The food that almost killed me, really could have freaking killed me! But, the worst part of it all was the service, or lack there of. Our server and this establishment showed absolutely no concern for my well being, for the hardship I had endured at their hands, my pain, discomfort or overall miserable experience. They where unsympathetic and unapologetic.

I am not the litigious type, but not expecting us to pay for for food that I did not get to eat and that almost killed me and an sympathetic attitude is customer service 101. An apology would have been terrific. But no to all of they above. 

To say I will never return is an understatement. 
I will say, it seemed like it was a pleasant setting with nice atmosphere. It could be nice if it wasn't lethal."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic and the prices are great. All of the soups say they are for 2, but could easily serve 4. The food portions are similar. One can easily get two meals from an entree."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Bamboo house for at least 8 or 9 years now and have never been unsatisfied. The lunch specials are a perfect portion size, at amazing prices.  The orange chicken or orange beef are the best I've had anywhere.  I strongly suggest this place if you are looking for amazing Chinese at a great price!"}
{"text":"I've been comming herecfor lunch for about two years.  This isn't like most chinese restaurants that cook or prepare prepare fast food chinese types food that we usually get at these typical phoenix restaurants, or malls
The service is good, the you prepare it quickly and more value than other nearby asian foods."}
{"text":"I often worry about trying new asian cuisine joints unless I have a trustworthy reccomendation, but I put on my brass cajones and took the girl to Bamboo House. Thank you baby Jesus. Their \"szechuan, mandarin, and pacific cuisine\" really hit the spot.

They have some of the best hot and sour soup that I have ever had in way too huge portions I would consider risking injury to make sweet love to this soup, and the eggrolls had really tasty filling.

The meal came with hot tea, which I have not had occur for awhile at any places for some reason.


Garlic shrimp..oh how I love you and will love you again cold when I am drunk and browsing the fridge this weekend...big tasty tender shrimps...mmmm. The Pad Thai...I may request a tad spicier next time but was overall completely delicious. The shrimp and chicken in it make my mouth water right now.

We were happy to take home the leftovers and if they are the only thing in the new fridge when we get moved tomorrow I will consider it the hippest fridge that ever was to be full of such midnight snack worthy leftovers."}
{"text":"After a long morning working at an event at the Pointe Hilton Tapatio Cliffs Resort (where, consequently, I had my wedding reception), my friend/colleague and I were exhausted and ravenous. I was fairly sure there was a Chinese restaurant nearby, so Heather hopped on her iPhone and found Bamboo House. 

I loved that the lunch came with hot tea; although, the waiter never asked us if we wanted anything else to drink besides the tea and water. It was probably best that we stuck with water after sitting outside for 6 hours, so we really didn't think much of it.

Heather ordered the Pad Thai, and I got the House Special Chicken. I wished now that I would have asked if the chicken was large chunks or thin pieces (it's large chunks) because I would have enjoyed it more if I was thin. The sauce, though, was really quite good. Our meal came with Egg Drop Soup. I'm not normally a fan, but I really liked their soup. There were mushrooms and tofu, a new addition to the soup for me, and the broth was thinner, which I also liked. 

I opted for steamed rice instead of fried, and the steamed rice was not that great. I wonder now if it was not so fresh. It didn't stick together and soak up the sauce the way I love rice to do at Chinese restaurants. Rather, it was more like home-cooked Minute rice. 

I was way too full to even think about eating the egg roll that came with my meal. They gave us quite a bit of food for a $6 lunch special.

I'm so rarely in the area, that I doubt I'll venture out just to go to Bamboo House again, but if I am ever in the vicinity and want Chinese, I'll remember again!"}
{"text":"First or second time coming here. I got the chicken Lo Mein and it was just ok. My mother got the beef and scallops combination and concurred that it was just ok. But the service is good, waiter was nice and the food came out very quickly."}
{"text":"All of their alcoholic beverages, including martinis are $4.50... but beware, when you order said drink, the server will most likely stare back at you blankly, nod, and walk away. Server will then arrive with a \"fruity drink\" that may or may not have a crusty cherry in it. But, it's $4.50. Sure, you had a hankering for a Tom Collins, but just keep quiet and drink your fruit punch.  

The cuisine here is a notch above the liquor... I cannot tear them apart on this, because it truly is the best Chinese I have ever had for this price. My man and I are creatures of habit and we always order the same things... we start with the egg flower soup, then order the sweet and sour chicken, and lastly, the orange chicken, because we are Americans who love sweet, fattening, fried chicken.

The staff is friendly, the food is prompt and delicious, we spend about $30 to $40 each visit and just writing this review makes my mouth water. 

Cheers"}
{"text":"This place used to be so so great! The friendly white guy, who I always assumed was the owner, wasn't there the last few times I have picked up to-go orders and that may coincide with the fact that the last few orders were barely OK. 

Our orders used to always be piping hot, full of flavor, and correct! The last few times we have been so disappointed...the sesame chicken was somehow super greasy yet dried out at the same time, the veggies were swimming in way way too much sauce, and the food itself was the temperature of something that had been sitting around waiting to be sold. 
Also, the Chinese woman that handled my last order was incredibly rude when I arrived to pick up. What happened to this place?! Unfortunately I don't think we will stick around to find out. Such a shame, you used to be our absolute favorite!"}
{"text":"This establishment has gone down hill, food is now greasy, and not what it used to be before being sold. 
Egg drop soup is watery no flavor. Egg rolls are greasy and over fried."}
{"text":"Orange Chicken is sweet and tangy. You can order it with more spice and enjoy the sweet with the heat.

The sizzling rice soup in good. We order it with Shrimp only. Otherwise, you get beef, chicken and 1 shrimp in it."}
{"text":"Bamboo house was my favorite Chinese restaurant until recently, Sam sold and now it's under new ownership.. Menu is the same but not the quality and freshness.. We always order the orange chicken. Seems like the same recipe but it's just not as fresh as it was before. Or maybe the chicken is poor quality. Also the egg rolls are not as big as they were before but they still taste the same. The fried rice has way to much egg. I do like the new china you're serving the sweet and sour sauce in.. If Bamboo House  does not make some changes we won't be back :("}
{"text":"This was once my favorite place for Chinese food.  Went here at least two times a month.  Moved to the other side of town and haven't been back for a few months.  Did not know until I tasted the tea that something was not right.  It used to have the best jasmine tea in town.  This time it tasted like yukky water. We called the waiter over and asked what happened to the tea, his reply was \"oh it's a little weak but I can bring you a tea bag.\"
What!!!!  No thank you.  We'll drink water.  Then we tasted our food and omg.  I had to call him back to ask if the restaurant had been sold since I didn't see anyone I recognized- especially the owner or his family.  He told us it was sold about 10 months ago.  The food was so far below what it used to be, I can't even describe it except that it was awful.  Please - whatever you do - save yourself the trouble and find a better place.  My husband left a full plate of food.  We will NEVER go back there (unless a Chinese family buys it)."}
{"text":"Had dinner here for the first time.  Egg rolls were really good.  Hot and sour soup was delicious.  Mongolian beef -- yum!  Kung Pao chicken was not bad either.  Busy place with what appeared to be a lot of loyal customers.  Friendly service and pretty fast.  Reminded me of the kind of Chinese food dad would take the family out for when I was a kid.  

I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"It was okay. I have been here with my ex a few years ago and i thought it was good but now its like they changed the recipe. My dad and i had takeout from this place last night. He got the kung pao chicken and i had the house chicken. He said it wasnt great but okay which meant edible and he could find somewhere else that had better chinese food since he just moved here into the area. My house chicken, on the other hand was alright too, but nothing like china village on camelback which i love. Im having the leftovers now and im surprised that the sauce for the chicken turned into a GELATINOUS GOO which im like \"what the eff is this??\" Yeaaaaaaaa..time to find another place in the area."}
{"text":"This place used to be amazing, and now the food is just bland. Orange chicken was a mess, and the almond chicken tastes like nothing at all. Sorry to say, but yuck. Sad to see a good place go downhill. Best part of our last meal there was the steamed rice. Unfortunately, won't be back here again."}
{"text":"The food is good (except the beef and broccoli - which was bland). The BBQ pork is very yummy! So is the chow mein, orange chicken, and mongolian beef. It only gets 3 stars from me because they don't have the option for combos. When I go to a chinese restuarant I want a plate with like 3 things that I like on it. But this is not an option here. Which is sad, because I LOVE ALMOND CHICKEN, and my husband HATES it. So I never get almond chicken because you have to share all the food. Each dish is a large plate that you share among the table. If they would let me make a combo, they'd get at least 4 stars from me."}
{"text":"In 2009 When I became vegan (within that Month) my ex and I went to bamboo house I think on 7th st and thunderbird. I asked for orange tofu. They gave me orange chicken. He was vegan too. I didn't notice :( but be did. He went and threw up when we got home. I never went there again. I have no idea why they served me meat. My ex had a bite too. Tofu sounds nothing like chicken."}
{"text":"Very affordable place to eat.  What seems to bring people here is the daily lunch specials at 5.95 and you do get a decent portion for that price along with a small complimentary bowl of egg drop soup.  Service not the best but you really can't beat the price here at all."}
{"text":"Tried this place the other night. The service was good. I was served a small portion of duck and the chef sent out an extra portion of house chicken with it. My kids liked their beef skewers."}

{"text":"Good neighborhood spot for dine-in or take out Chinese. They have a nice variety in the menu and know how to run some good lunch specials. The food is good, definitely above average. The house specialties on the menu is a good place to start.

Service is really good for an Asian place. They're mostly friendly and aren't assholes if you take a table 15 minutes before they close. The owner and his wife are particularly nice and seem to value the regulars."}
{"text":"The Bamboo House may be under new management, but is even better than ever. This outfit has the BEST chinese food in the Valley of the Sun and the WIDEST variety of cuisine you can imagine. The dishes from any portion of the 8 page menu are always excellent to terrific and the prices are GREAT too. We go usually for lunch, order dinner food too, and take food home for subsequent meals. We have been going here for 18 years and are NEVER disappointed. The people we invite to have meals with us here are always impressed and become new customers if they aren't already. Management and service personnel are always friendly and enthusiastic. By the way, the beer is really cold."}

With that said, I generally stick to the Chicken choices (Orange, Sesame, House Special, Garlic, etc) so these options may be relatively safe.

{"text":"Been going here for years its Good food and service, the staff brings out your food quick and refills on time. Its not very spicy so if u like spicy u can ask it to be prepared that way! They also have the condiments mustard, sauces and chili paste if u need more heat! The appitizers are good and reasonably priced, they also have some liqour beer etc."}
{"text":"Love this place for take-out! They have taken my expired 20% off coupons, which is nice. They are always fast and friendly and the food is great. I have never encountered any \"mystery meat\" in any dishes I have ordered. The orange chicken is the best! Not as sweet and fried like other places. The won ton soup is another favorite."}
{"text":"Just wasn't good

I really hate to write a negative review about a restaurant that receives so many positive comments but the food at Bamboo House just wasn't good. With that being said let's start off on a positive note.  If you go to Bamboo House , you will receive good customers service. 

Now time to move onto the meal.  My meal got off to a bad start with the egg-drop soup, which consisted of a tasteless, watery liquid in which floated, hard peas, tofu, and thick strands of eggs.  Moving onto the entrees, the Mongolian Beef was tough and chewy, the chicken chow mein dish was likewise an exercise for one's jaw. The rice, eggrolls, and fried wontons were equally disappointing.

In all honesty, I would be hard-pressed to think of a place with worse Chinese food."}
{"text":"I have been to this place many times very good food. However last 2 times visit and one pickup had brought it to one star don't know what happened my wife and I always looked forward to eat at this place.
Need to change no flavor like before very poor food quality."}
{"text":"I tried Bamboo House for the first time last week, and let me tell you, I will be back soon!!
I have found it a little hard to find good Chinese food in Phoenix. I have a couple places I like, but nothing I'd rave about. 
Until Bamboo House.
I've never been to Chinatown in NYC, but if I had to guess, this place would fit right in. 
I loved the decor. It wasn't new and modern, but old school and comfortable. Reminded me of what a (fictional) popular Chinese restaurant looks like on tv shows.

Now the food. I went with the bf and we started with Egg Drop Soup. 5 stars. It was the best I've ever had.  Presented much nicer than standard thrown in a messy cup- it was brought in a pot and served to us. Tons of tofu and veggies ( I love!!), and it wasn't too thick and yolky.
I got the beef fried rice, he the mu shu chicken. Beef fried: 4.5 stars. It was delicious. No complaints. Not too dark either. I don't like heavy soy sauce. Mu Shu Chicken was not only chickety-china yummy, but we were fully served. Our waitress folded the crepes for us and delicately placed them on our plates with chopsticks. 4.5 stars

The serving staff had great team work, our table was immediately cleared without us feeling rushed, they were very friendly, and we felt like guests. 5 stars

Oh and too sweeten it even more, very reasonably priced!!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: Vegetarian here.

Bamboo house is one of our favorite Chinese restaurants in North Phoenix. Other people think so too, as it is normally very busy, although the place is big with ample seating, so there is generally no waiting.

The egg drop soup is delicious. They will make it Vegetarian if requested (water base instead of meat broth). We just love that soup!

They also serve hot tea (Oolong?) to everyone, which is another big plus in our book.

The main courses are good, I enjoy the orange flavored tofu and some of their other veggie dishes as well. My girlfriend has tried some of the meat dishes and was happy with them. Dishes come served with either steamed or fried rice (which might be a dollar extra).

We really like this place and would recommend that you check it out."}
{"text":"Update - the Bamboo House has new owners.  The food has not changed and the service seems to be even better.  I still love this place and eat here regularly."}
{"text":"Really good, old school authentic food.  Very affordable and quick.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The ladies are nice, the rice is hard and the chicken is crispy...try this place if you want."}
{"text":"Definitely hard to find a decent Chinese take out place in AZ when you're from NY, but I must say this place is pretty good, we ordered a few times and it always tastes good, chicken n broccoli was good, pad Thai was good as well, although a lot of people love their hot n sour soup I must say I have tried it and it is good soup but its definitely not Hot or Sour, they put shrimps and chicken in which is a nice addition but it costs as much as a large meal would, I like to get a small h&s soup as an appetizer but I can't do that here because its only 1 size and costs about $8 which I think is too much for a take out place! Other than that I really can't complain, I've never been inside, but when my husband picked up the food he said it looks very clean and nice so it's definitely not one of those places where u question if that chicken and broccoli actually has chicken inside! ; )"}
{"text":"I have been coming here off and on for years. Had brother visit and bragged about their food to him. Ordered takeout. The orange chicken was tough and uncuttable. Teriyaki was nasty. It was embarrassing to me because I had suggested it.My brother and I were very disappointed."}
{"text":"There aren't many restaurants in my neighborhood, and even though I'm not usually a fan of Chinese we went to the Bamboo House because it is close.   I'm glad we did, because it was delightful.

What I liked about Bamboo House was the service and crunchy veggies.  Family owned and operated, I assume our servers were the owners.  They gave great service.   Our food was good, they veggies especially were cooked perfectly.  

Super cute pics of local folks on the walls and funny kitch deco was an added bonus!"}
{"text":"Service was great! Food was a little bland. They did have great lunch deals though! I probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"Bamboo house has been a moon valley staple. I've been eating here since I was a child- many, many years. My go to dishes are Mongolian beef, egg foo yong with pork, and egg drop soup. Lunch deals here have always been fantastic. Now for the review. I noticed different staff working there over my past few visits. Many Caucasian staff when id never seen that before. I also noticed the portion sizes decrease. Quality of meat and freshness of veggies went down. The negative change remained constant. It wasn't just a bad few trips. What gives after YEARS of greatness?? Ownership. I learned our beloved longtime owner Sam sold the business. No wonder the negative changes. I'm very sad and dont think this place will ever be the same. Neighborhood magic lost :("}
{"text":"Ok, I USED TO LOOOOVE this place. Mostly, because of the previous owner Sammy and his wife...however my recent experience under the new ownership & management left me missing my prior friendly, efficient, and humble service I so looked forward to seeing before.

The food-
Same menu, however FRESHNESS....?? My fried rice tasted \"day old\" and my hot and sour soup, was warm and splattered all over the outside of my bowl. 

Cleanliness-
Although, the new manager seemed well versed and knowledgeable in the area of food and caffeine content in the jasmine tea served, he seemed oblivious to the 3 flys  swarming our dining table...thus leaving me with the notion of not desiring to return anytime soon.  Which, is so disappointing as I liked to frequent this place on a cloudy day."}
{"text":"This place is the best, I have been coming here all my life. Their orange chicken is awesome. Come in for lunch and you will get an awesome deal but dinner is not pricey. I still drive from Arcadia for their food if i am really in the mood for great Chinese food."}
{"text":"Having just moved into the neighborhood, we ventured to try Bamboo House, hoping to find a close place to get our Chinese fix. Unfortunately, on our visit, B.H. did not live up to the hype. My boyfriend put it very succinctly: \"There wasn't anything wrong with the rice.\" We ordered meat dumplings, orange chicken and garlic chicken. The meat dumplings were no frills, basically barely seasoned meat stuffed into wrappers and then fried. The orange chicken was passable, but nothing special (I think Panda Express does better, and I loathe that place). The garlic chicken was a spicy, sodden mess, barely edible. As if this wasn't disappointing enough, my hot tea was weak, vaguely honey flavored water. His iced tea appeared to be the same tea poured over ice. But, at least the rice was okay, right?"}
{"text":"When I walked in it took a few minutes to be greeted, once I was approached I got the up/down look. It made me feel like this was an upscale restaurant but didn't look it. But having just got out if the shower and wearing flip flops, it doesn't surprise me.

The lady was efficient and helpful when I couldn't remember the name. I got the Pad Thai and Hot/Sour soup as mentioned here.

It didn't take long to get my food. The decor was nice and it looked clean. The man who gave me my order was nice, he greeted a lady who was sitting near me familiarly.

The Pad Thai was delicious and a huge serving 3 days of dinner for me. Just spicy enough and the rice seemed to much along with it but it all came together. 

Hot and Sour soup was great! Burnt my mouth because I was impatient to get it in my mouth. Just the broth had so much flavor.

Both dishes had huge shrimp and big chunks of chicken in the Pad Thai. 

Maybe a few more chunks will make it better and being there the first time with the up/down look made me feel awkward. Lol

But I'll go back."}
{"text":"This used to be a fantastic place.  Sadly, It is not any longer.  The previous owner sold it, and although the new owner thinks it is the same food, he is mistaken.  My hot and sour soup tasted quite different from the way it had.  The pad thai was entirely different, and the lemongrass chicken no longer the aromatic joy it was before.  The new guy thinks that brown sauce is all the same.

I mourn the loss of my once favorite Chinese food...."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, I've been going to bamboo for a few years now and they have some of the best Chinese food around! The orange chicken and house special is the best!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite restaurants! Homey atmosphere, with a large menu. Their hot & sour soup is soo good. Our family and friends have never orders badly here, really great place."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food I have found in Phoenix. The service was excellent they were quick to get the check to us when we're ready to go.
 The food was very good. We had a great experience and the servers were fast and friendly"}
{"text":"Let's just say this. I feel sorry for you people who thinks this restaurant serves good food. Went there after reading all your fine reviews here. I will be short and sweet. Hot and sour soup was passable, the pad thai was edible. House chicken was big chunks of deep fried breading with salty brown sauce. Mongolian beef was salted jerky with green onions, and the fried rice is just white rice with soy sauce in it. The soda was okay. If you have ever had decent Chinese food,, stay clear. This is not it. Will someone get my money back?"}
{"text":"It is hard to find good Chinese food in Phoenix. I will attest and say they are safe!! Lunch special is Fabulous!! I have had different items just to test there flexibility with the dishes and they pass. This is my top choice!!!

Dining in the service is excellent. The lunch special provides a tasty soup, free tea, and an eggroll along with your entree. For Phoenix this is decent Chinese food!"}
{"text":"The last few times that I have been there, the food has been horrid.  You ask for suicide hot and get sweet!  Ask for crispy and get it so overcooked that it is chicken jerky.  

We went to go have lunch the other day and noticed that someone new was hanging a lunch special banner and I asked him if it was new owners.  I was told it was.  

Unfortunately, the food is not the same and now I am looking for a new Szechuan place.  Any suggestions?"}
{"text":"On the past experience of my friend with this Chinese restaurant, we went and tried Bamboo House. My friend did all the ordering... maybe we'll change that procedure on our next restaurant visit. Bamboo House claims to be a Chinese restaurant, but also lists Thai and Vietnamese creations.

What we ordered...

Starters: Seafood Soup - This was a very thick soup filled to the brim with seafood ingredients: Shrimp, Scallops, Abalone, Fish, vegetables, and some ingredients I could not recognize! Mistake #1: The soup itself had a tap water aftertaste! My friend disagreed... but I know I tasted tap water!

Drinks: Mai Tai - Yummy, yummy... sweet and very alcoholic. The bartender really knows how to mix his drinks. And you get a little umbrella \"thing\" with your drink!

Main Dishes: 

House Special Chicken - This dish was essentially Chinese Fried Chicken in a batter immersed in their \"special\" sauce. The batter was slightly crispy when bitten into, and was especially tasty and had interesting textures when consumed.

Kung Pao Chicken II - Off menu Kung Pao Chicken without the Cashews. Skinned Chicken with Shrimp, Mushrooms, Peas, Water Chestnuts, and Celery covered by their \"special\" sauce.

Both dishes were supposed to be spicy \"hot\".... NOT!

Mistake #2: Never duplicate any meat dishes... we discovered both dishes were immersed in their \"special\" sauce which made differentiation of the dishes difficult, at best! Did I just have the House Special or the Kung Pao? Let me take a close look! Not very creative cooking!

Demographics of restaurant: All Caucasian clientele. Less than 30% of capacity.
Located in a small strip mall setting.
Service was friendly and attentive.

Probably will not be coming back here for the food... But maybe for the Polynesian style drinks... They're pretty refreshing and Good!

Next visit to any restaurant... I'm ordering for both of us!

My Friend's rating: 3
My rating:               2.25 (Saved by MaiTai)"}
{"text":"Bamboo House is an unassuming Chinese restaurant with a cozy, no frills interior. We went on a Saturday night, and they seemed busy. Still, they sat us right away and were incredibly attentive all evening. Great service. 

Now for the food. The hot and sour soup is a must order. It was perfect. We also ordered the beef and broccoli and the shanghai noodles. Both were super tasty; however, their menu is massive so I don't think I'll ever order the same entree twice. 

Finally, the drinks. Five stars for their cocktail menu. They have a huge list of cocktails that would do the cast of Mad Men proud. Lots of classics and some fun Polynesian drinks, complete with fruit garnish and paper umbrellas. And the cocktails are cheap to boot, not to mention delicious.  I recommend the coconut gin one. 

I'm moving away from this neighborhood, but I'll definitely find excuses to head to North Phoenix just so I can get back to this place. A neighborhood gem for sure."}
{"text":"IMO THE best Chinese in Phoenix! Authentic dishes and Chinese beers, excellent service, great atmosphere, very good prices - thoroughly recommend.

Clearly I am not the only one thinking this as the owner appears to know the names of a LOT of the clientele - demonstrating regular repeat business."}
{"text":"This is the worst chinese restaurant we ever order food from.  Not just the flavors are bad, they can even screw up a simple hot and sour soup in the worst possible way.  The main dishes are meatless full of vegetables without hardly any pork or beef, which is what we ordered.
We lived in the Moon Valley area for many years and  used to go there, but now it is not what it was ten years ago, it is a complete disgrace.
Will not go back or order food from them again."}
{"text":"Great ginger fish and whole fish    Close convenient for me and priced well    Also my son really liked their sesame chicken.  Will go back soon"}
{"text":"Our first visit here was last night, for a Friday night it was doing a brisk business but there was no wait which was even better.  

It's your typical pink, ornate throwback chinese restaurant but it has charm.  Loved the drink menu, specialty cocktails for only $4.50--I had a Scorpion.  

The food was good, hot and fast.  I had Happy Family and there was lots of shrimp, scallops and other meats.  Hubby had garlic beef, LOTS of garlic and almost too spcity for our delicate palates--you just had to keep eating it.

They look like that have good lunch specials that even extend to Saturday.  Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"We occasionally go here, when we are hungry and don't feel like cooking.  The 20% off coupon in the Moon Valley Tattler, helps, too.

Tonight my husband ordered Lemon Grass Chicken, which the waiter said was one of his favorites..  It was dry, no sauce, the chicken was dark meat, and kind of fatty.  My husband was not pleased at all.

I ordered Curry Shrimp, which is #313 (Curry Chicken), but I ask for shrimp, for a little extra charge.  It was good, but I would not say that it was spicy, like the little red pepper by the description indicated.  But it had a lot of shrimp, and lots of vegetables, and was pretty tasty.

Ok, back to my husband -- who was very unhappy with his dish (Lemon Grass Chicken).  We nicely told the waiter that it was dry, and that the chicken was icky, and he nicely offered to bring something else, so my husband settled on the Curry Chicken, and specifically asked if it was \"white meat\" chicken, and was told yes.
They nicely bring extra rice, at no cost, and serve up hot tea, and glasses of water, which was fine with us.  

Rich was our waiter.  Thank you for accommodating us, so nicely and professionally."}
{"text":"In our quest to find good Chinese food this place was not too bad. We came during the lunch specials and for the amount of food you get for the price is more than reasonable! We really enjoyed the hot tea that comes with the lunches. 

I ordered the Shrimp & Chicken Hunan style and while it was good, I found it to be a little too saucy and not spicy as indicated.

The egg drop soup was ok, a lot of mushrooms and not a lot of flavor. Adding some of the chili oil made it quite delicious, would definitely come again if we are in the area."}
{"text":"Was very impressed with the Level of customer service at this place. Most Asian restaurant, though very tasty food, usually lack warmth and customer service; not this place.

The owner walks around and know most of his clients by name! Sharing stories and giving and receving hugs.

In top of that they provide a complimentary pot of tea as you sit down.

This experience might just make me a regular here!"}
{"text":"From previous experiences, this had become one of our favorite Chinese food restaurants in the valley.  We went here for dinner tonight with high expectations.  Tonight's visit was unbelievably disgusting!  It started off with us receiving dirty silverware only to be replaced twice by none other than some more dirty silverware.  Then the plates we received were dirty and had to be replaced as well.  As if this wasn't disgusting enough, as we were eating, my boyfriend found a dead spider in his food!  We brought in to the attention of the manager and he offered to bring us more food but who could eat after that? Needless to say, that was the end of our dining experience and we will not be returning."}
{"text":"The food is good; tasty with their own twist.  My complaint is the portion size.  I ordered $36 worth of take-out and it did not feed three.  None of the containers were full.  I guess i will stick with their lunch specials (eat in.)"}
{"text":"When I first moved to AZ, this place was pretty rocking. As a transplant from Cali I had separation anxiety from my Combo A-B-C options of virtually all mom/pops chinese places out there. This place offers a decent lunch special $5.95 - $6.95, includes an entree, soup, egg roll, and wontons. They serve complimentary tea, which goes well with the food. The food is served quickly, which is great especially when I go in with my 5 year old. The times I have been there the staff has been very nice. My recent visit was Tuesday, I had a customized Almond Shrimp and my eating buddy, had something which I have totally forgotten by now! Food was good value for the buck. Definitely on our rotation for casual eating."}
{"text":"Get the Orange Chicken.

Been going to this place since I moved to Phx in 1998.  The owner used to be Sam and he recently retired.  I have heard it's under new ownership but all the cooks are still there.  I hope so...

Sam was always friendly and remembered my group of friends since we started coming in years ago.

If you want to try a drink, get a Zombie.  \"Strong, but Good\"

Good egg rolls, poo poo platter, chicken chow mein, house chicken, crystal shrimp, happy family, mongolian beef.  Haven't had a bad meal at Bamboo House!

Very well priced compared to other Chinese places of this caliber.  I challenge you to find a better orange chicken in the Valley."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for over 20 years and has really gone downhill in the last 2 years...not sure if they sold or not. Food was always great now it's just below average. I need to find another good Chinese restaurant near Moon Valley, any suggestions?"}
{"text":"I give the Bamboo House a favorable rating. It's my local Chinese food haunt. Giant fan of their Hot and Sour soup. I judge a Chinese restaurant based on a few dishes and Hot and Sour is one. Personally, I think it may be the best in the valley. Another favorite of mine is there Mongolian Beef and hey, Larry can do Thai there too. Pad Thai....It's better than some of their Thai brethren. The pan fried noodles are scrum-delicious and when I want to elevate my blood sugar, I go for their Sweet and Sour Pork. Egg Foo Young is a nice addition. Portions are always large and yes, I take home what I can't eat and have Noodles and Eggs...could be an idea for a chain. 

When I want really good Chinese, I mean really good, I have to go to Orange County around Garden Grove in the mean time, I'm a fan of Sam Phan (yes, the owners name is Sam Phan)...."}
