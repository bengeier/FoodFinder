{"text":"I had lunch here and was super disappointed. I only ate here because it was pouring rain (like buckets of rain, thunder and lightning, and the whole mall actually lost power for like 10 minutes) so I was pretty much stranded and hungry.

The food court at the Montreal Premium Outlet Mall is pretty limited. I like noodle soups, so I thought that I would try Umi Teriyaki.

I got the Beef Udon Soup $9.99. There's a coupon in the coupon book for a free fountain drink with a meal at Umi Teriyaki, so I got a ginger ale.

The soup should have been called Gristle Udon Soup. They were really generous with the \"meat\", but it was mostly gristle.  It was so gross, I picked it all out and pretty much just ate the noodles and vegetables. 

That being said the broccoli was perfectly al dente and I liked the spiralled carrots. The noodles were also tasty with the right amount of chewiness. The broth was a bit salty though.

Staff were nice and the line moved quickly.

I just can't get over how fatty and gristly the beef was though :("}
{"text":"First visit to the premium outlets and came upon this restaurant. I took the Udon noodles and my wife took the teriyaki chicken. The noodles were $8.99 and the chicken was $7.99. Food was good but disappointed with the portions. Both were on the small side. Noodles were missing some flavour if you don't add any side sauce. If they increased portions, would increase rating to 4."}
{"text":"Ordered food here while visiting the outlets - the portions were okay (on the small side) but the taste was, well, absent. The vegetarian udon was barely more than boiled noodles - would not recommend."}
