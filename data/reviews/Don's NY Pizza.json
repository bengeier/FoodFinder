{"text":"Don's NY Pizza opened a location down the street from me on Camelback rd. ( 9971 W. Camelback Road) in Phoenix,  For the first time since moving to Arizona, I can honestly say I've had \"real\" pizza! I come from New Jersey and I have missed great italian food - till now. Don's NY Pizza is amazing. The food tastes just like home! The crust was perfect on our Sicilian pie, and the cannoli ....heavenly! Welcome to the neighborhood,  Don's!"}
{"text":"We have had there pizza and wings several times, and they never disappoint! We love the daily specials that they offer and very reasonably priced. We will always choose this pizza place over any of the chain restaurants."}
{"text":"Love this pizza! The cheese, the sauce.. magic! The ppl are always so nice too! Still have to tey other items, but so far I'm in love!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  Good fresh food. Great people and they deliver to their Neighbors."}
{"text":"Excellent NY style pizza.  So happy to eat here! Hard to see coming from the North but is just around the corner south of Home Depot and Taco Bell."}
{"text":"I was in this area and was craving a good NY style pizza. This place hit the spot. The staff was friendly and made sure we were well taken care of. The place was clean and inviting. I live in Chandler, but whenever I'm in Peoria again I'm definitely making a stop back here and explore the menu."}
{"text":"Try the garlic knots - you won't regret it!  The New York style pizza was delicious and we also enjoyed the BBQ wings.    The menu had a variety of calzones and subs--we'll be coming back to try more."}
{"text":"The pizza is amazingly good. My favorite place. Been many times. The staff is nice and helpful. The other meals are good too. The pizza here is the closest to New York . It is totally worth your time to check it out ."}
{"text":"Amazing! My roommate and I have been looking for a local pizza place we can agree on and we finally found it! Have ordered from here quite a few times and the pizza is delicious. The one time we got a pizza that wasn't exactly what we ordered, we called and they were extremely friendly and sent a new pizza over immediately. So impressed with the customer service and their professionalism. Highly recommend ordering from Don's."}
{"text":"We ordered wings, pizza and garlic knots. Everything was very good! The bbq on the wings was a bit sweet and tangy... Different but good! The knots were hot and pull apart soft. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Very good Pizza. Lots of cheese and plenty of toppings. Staff was friendly. I will be back."}
{"text":"Worst place ever calzone was half cooked service was terrible over charged me and had to give me extra change back after I said something about it to bad I only have two thumbs I wish I could give this place 10 thumbs down"}
{"text":"First time visiting today.  Got take out.  Manicotti for the wife and Chicken Parm for me.  Figured those were staples that every Italian restaurant should be able to do well.  Let me just say, they far exceeded my expectations! The accompanying salad and garlic bread knots were equally delicious! I will definitely be returning here in very near future!  The atmosphere was casual, the restaurant was very clean and the employees very polite, courteous and seemed enthused to be there."}
{"text":"Love the white pizza, generous garlic, generous ricotta. Ultimate Comfort food. As close to Brooklyn NY taste as we have had in AZ. Take out. Eat in. There is one big table for a large group and they were very accommodating."}
{"text":"New pizza joint in my immediate area. Ordered for pick up because delivery was 45-50 minutes but that's to be expected on a rainy Friday night. I ordered the meat lovers calzone, 2 cheese slices and the buffalo chicken sub. I also asked for 4 ranch's. The calzone was really good, excellent flavor. If you order it, the greasy looking stuff is butter not grease. Their marinara sauce is one of the best I have had when it comes to ordering out. The buffalo chicken sub was a little skimpy but would have been really good if I had the ranch I ordered. The pizza was good, big slices, my 8 year old ate that and said it was the best, I didn't try it. I am really picky when it comes to Italian as I am Italian and have lived on the east coast and if you have been, you know it's hard to find good Italian here in AZ.  As I mentioned I didn't get the ranch I requested but the service besides that was great. Very friendly and welcoming and took the time to chat about where they were from etc. I will be going back but double checking for my ranch!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've ever had, hands down! We are regulars, as we live right around the corner. They are always friendly and welcoming and take the extra time to get to know their customers. There isn't an item on the menu that we don't absolutely love!"}
{"text":"We loved the pizza! The sauce had great flavor and the crust was deliciously crisp. The staff was helpful and friendly. We will be back."}
{"text":"First time here had the NY supreme. So good!!! Lightly crispy crust and so much flavor. Staff was super friendly and place was clean. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Just had dons again....had the spicy alfredo pasta.had the garlic knots.kids ate a calzone....this place did not disappoint.awesome food hot and fresh."}
{"text":"I love dons the food is amazing and so is there service I came here 4 my birthday and it was absolutely the best this will always be my favorite Pizza spot"}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time being right around the corner from my house. Loved it, great pizza and friendly staff"}
{"text":"Definitely not NY pizza. Just because they were big slices doesn't make it NY style. Pretty tasteless, super greasy, and $2 to add a topping is a little pricy. Only tried the pizza but I wouldn't be back for it. I love pizza and when I have to force myself to eat a second slice so I don't feel like I completely threw my money away there's a problem. Super nice people is why they get a second star."}
{"text":"Delicious! Authentic NY! Will definitely be going back for more!  Calzone was cooked to perfection with good quality cheese, antipasto salad very fresh!"}
{"text":"So far have had 4 different items from the menu. NY style pizza is great, big slices, good cheese and real nutty, toasted flavor which tells me they use quality ingredients. Wings were good flavor, good sauce and trimmed well were the drumsticks. My nephews wanted the BBQ style and those seemed to be a hit. Tonight we went with the pasta. Chicken Alfredo, Chicken Piccata Entree and Baked Lasagna. Each came with a side salad and couple of garlic knots. Well it was a lot of food but worth it. We used to go out to Carrabba's, but after there serving size went down to 1/4 of what they used to it wasn't worth it. Don's NY satisfied our craving, and good size portions. We could of ordered two entree for 4 people. I'm too full to continue writing....and you can't go wrong with free delivery."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever!  This place is awesome, the food is phenomenal and the service is friendly!  We were eyeing a speciality pizza and the cook gave us two slices on the house.  Truly phenomenal!"}
{"text":"The pizza is okay. Not as good as Ray's but similar. What was most disappointing is that they don't serve any beer. It's really close to my house which was awesome but as soon as we realized they didn't serve any beer we ordered our pizza to go. Most likely won't go back."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Italian restaurant in the valley. Great food for a great price and the customer service is second to none. We dine in and order out frequently and they're consistently great. Hands down, Don's is the best. My favorite dish is the Chicken Briana. I recommend this place to anyone looking for a delicious Italian meal."}
{"text":"We just moved into the area and thought we would try this place. It is totally awesome. We ordered pizza and wings. Everything was delicious and they delivered it on time, just like they said they would."}
{"text":"4 stars instead of 5 because they cut corners a bit on the cheese. No pizzerias out here use Grande....and I wish they would.   HOWEVER for pizza in AZ.....and in the west valley...this place is fantastic. I really enjoyed it and they deliver.   I attached a pic of the pizza as soon as it was delivered. They even cooked it perfectly which seems to be an issue here in AZ."}
{"text":"Really great place that stays open till ten pm on weekdays nights . Family owned and really friendly and great customer service . Came for the pizza which is really good I suggest the Buffaloe chicken pizza but I also tried the spicy chicken Alfredo and it was one of the best pats dishes I've had att any restaraunt in Arizona . Been back many times and have loved everything I've tried . The wings calzones and other dishes are well worth it !! A must visit"}
{"text":"EXCELLENT pizza and bread....but even better service. The owners themselves will see to it that your order is made YOUR way, no matter how special you may think it is.... I feel so important and loved when I take a bite of this delicious food...and I am a VERY PICKY EATER!!! Big thanks to the owners of Don's NY Pizza for making me feel like a V.I.P. and also for taking so much pride in the AMAZING food!!!!"}
{"text":"2nd time here and customer service has been amazing they are so friendly and the food is amazing, this has become our favorite pizza spot."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza. Right down the street from Camelback ranch. 2 huge slices and a drink for $7 at lunchtime. I got the buffalo chicken and the pepperoni and mushroom, both were great. I'll definitely be back every time I come out here for spring training!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a pizza place in the area and went to Yelp and picked Don's. I ordered a pizza and wing special and overall it was solid.  Pizza: it's a mix of NY and we'll normal pizza, was a little dry but overall solid flavor and I got sausage and it was cut sausage which was nice and not pellets. I've had much better pizza overall but again this was solid.  Wings: they were small but to me that's a good thing, I've always thought the medium and small wings tasted better. They where cooked well and with straight hot sauce. Good stuff  I will order again and like I said solid overall."}
{"text":"The spicy chicken alfredo is amazing. It is not really spicy-hot, just delicious. If you are someone who can't do really spicy food you will be really ok with the delicious spicy chicken alfredo."}
{"text":"Excellent NY pizza!  It's near Home Depot on the SW corner of 99th Ave and Camelback, behind Taco Bell.  The pizza is delicious and nutritious."}
{"text":"I've only tried their wings and they have the best wings I have ever tasted! I work at a pizza and wing place as well, but order delivery from this place to bring to my work because they're so amazing! I always have them call me when I'm outside my work, so that I can meet them outside to prevent other guests see me ordering wings from a different place. My coworkers love their hot wings! I definitely plan on trying the other foods they have! Everyone is very friendly and outgoing"}
{"text":"Why go to DON's NY PIZZA? Because they'll make you an offer you can't refuse!!! Great slices, excellent appetizers and sides. These guys are the real deal! Step out of AZ and into Brooklyn via food."}
{"text":"This place just opened by our house. It is really really good! The pizza and wings are awesome. The fried calamari was also delicious! The employees seemed really friendly and it was delivered fast and piping hot."}
{"text":"Stopped in at 10:30 am for lunch since I start at 3 am lots of blue collar truck driver parking behind Home Depot 2 slices and a coke lunch special $5.75 can't go wrong pizza was better than back home on Long Island maybe I just haven't had good New York pizza in the last 25 years since I've been in this place so long but Don's pizza will suffice for now it was a celebration on the day mr Donald trump became our president"}
{"text":"Decided to try this fairly new pizza place a couple weeks ago. I am always very apprehensive of anywhere that has \"NY Pizza\" in its name as this has been a telltale sign in the past of the farthest thing from NY Pizza. I grew up about an hour outside of Philadelphia so I am no stranger to our beloved East coast pizza. This place, however, does not disappoint! The pizza is amazing. Best on the West side, BY FAR. The sides and wings are great also. They don't skimp on the toppings and the prices are fair. Needless to say, I have been back 3 times in just the past two weeks and plan to continue! You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place has delicious pizza! It was my first time trying and i loved the taste of the pizza and the wings! Recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place the chicken Caesar salad is my all time favorite!! However they marinade the chicken really sets the salad off! Always quick friendly service have been this salad weekly since I discovered it. This place does not disappoint they have delicious baked ziti also"}
{"text":"I just moved in the neighborhood and I am so excited I found this place I ordered a Greek salad that was really yummy and I ordered manicotti that tasted so fresh and handmade and their garlic bread knots are amazing and I had fried zucchini which I really fell in love with as  well"}
{"text":"Ordered Sicilian style margarita pizza last night. Ouch!!!  Sauce and bread flavorless!!!  I've had better gas station pizza. However previously ordered calzone and philly steak sandwich and they were quite good"}
{"text":"Very friendly, food is very good, and prices are fair clean inside and out it's my go too spot"}
{"text":"First time experience at Don's!  Everything from taking our order to getting our food was exceptional!  Very clean, friendly staff, prompt service and most importantly delicious food!  Will be returning and be recommending to our friends to try out."}
{"text":"Honey listen.   When you eat pizza with your eyes closed like it's a dessert? You've really found some place special. I never had pizza in New York but I'd bet that this is an exact replica if not better.  Yo Paulie? Your pizza was good but this was hands down the best pizza  donning the name of \"New York\" I've tasted.  I had half cheese and margarita...  About the cheese pizza... It was perfect, the cheese had the right amount of salt and chewiness, the sauce was a perfect complement to the cheese and the crust was chewy and soft and the crust was a crunchy treat.  About the margarita... The margarita...smh...so good it didn't make any sense lol you could taste everything and you could tell it was prepared with fresh ingredients. Before I even opened the box I could smell it and I knew not stuffing my face on the entire pie was going to be an effort. I just closed my eyes and enjoyed each bite. I ate half and I plan on saving the rest for breakfast lol.  I have found my goto pizza place in Phoenix!!"}
{"text":"Great daily lunch specials... pizzas rebaked so there  nice and hot.  Philly cheesesteak special is DELICIOUS! Honestly havent had a great steak sandwich like that before. The bread alone is delicious! Also chicken ceaser salad was awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely hands down one of the pizza eateries here in Phoenix! The wings are so good and the Alfredo is to die for!!  Prices are just right. This is going to be our new pizza spot from now on!!!"}
{"text":"We drive all the way from surprise for Don's pizza!! We moved here from NYC 4 months ago , not only does it taste like home the owners are super friendly. Love love the pizza! Crust crunchy cheese gooey and sauce tangy yet sweet. Grease check ! Just like Brooklyn pizza. The best we have found for AZ"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza... we were traveling thru Arizona and yelped a pizza place...Don's was on our route so we decided to give it a try... OMG! So good!!...now that we are home, we often talk about and look out for a pizza place as good as Don's and we have not found it... One of a kind... still craving Don's NY Pizza since April 2017..."}
{"text":"It's a great pie, the calzone is money. Food is always served piping hot!  You won't leave hungry.  Still haven't met Don"}
{"text":"Nothing looked or tasted like it was from New York. The slices in the case at 7pm seemed to already have been hanging out there for hours and either way, they did not look like NY style pizza (swirly sauce, no oregano).     I was working in the area, so I called in a Chicken Parmesan hero ($8) and an order of garlic knots for $2.50. The chicken was inedible, both rubbery and flavorless at the same time and could not be eaten. Their hero bread was better and their garlic knots, although clearly far from the best, were edible. They get hard fast, so eat the knots quick, but this batch was also undercooked.     If Don is really from NY, he needs to get retrained. He can probably get away with this kind of food in Peoria, but would get laughed out of the Big Apple."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch slices.  It just reached okay status.  Kinda greasy, kinda overpriced  Kinda hard to find.  Very forgettable.  Bummer."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza ! great owners staff. delivery is fast arrives hot. trying all there menu."}
{"text":"Hands down the best classic pizza and wings! We ordered the xl pepperoni, wings, and fried zucchini. The pizza was the size of a tire! The crust won us over because it wasn't a loaf of bread but wasn't so thin it was a cracker. It was crisp and soft all at once. You literally watch them toss it and make it as you're waiting. That takes confidence in your product to be willing to show exactly how it's done! We've had over done wings that let you sad and depressed. These wings were moist and juicy. We drove quite a ways for this place and it is now our #1 and we will def be back to try other items from their extensive menu."}
{"text":"As a northeasterner who knows pizza, I couldn't be more impressed this this place. Little pricy, but the pizza is actually that good."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! The pizza rolls are to die for!! Always nice and clean on the inside, lots of seating and parking! The staff is top notch very friendly and  well educated on the menu! Go check them out, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"It was already a long day of work and my coworkers and I decided to eat something different, food that will give us energy to keep working and so we checked out this Pizza Joint. My coworkers had pepperoni pizza and hot wings, they loved it. I had the Chicken Caesar Salad and a lemonade drink on the side. The Salad was delicious, service was excellent and good environment to have a lunch with coworkers."}
{"text":"Found this pizza shop thru yelp. We were out of towners visiting a friend and looking for local and good pizza. Don's NY pizza was awesome. Price was good and pizza sizes were amazing. The taste was great and I loved the crust. Zuchinni was good but not my kind of breading. The girl behind the counter was super sweet and helpful. Shop was clean and had lots of eating seating."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza and wings..delivery was a little longer than expected and cheese slid off the pizza which is why I didn't give 5 stars."}
{"text":"Been going here a couple years. This review is long past due. MUCH LOVE TO DON'S. Ate here around 20 times. Delivery, dine in, pick up. Great for kids. Consistently the best NY style pizza ever. Also had several pasta dishes. All delicious. Best spaghetti ever, surprisingly awesome. Not huge on the garlic knots, I think the garlic bread is better myself. But the sauce rocks. I recommend getting extra with bread or even pizza. So grateful for this place. The customer service is unparalleled. Always so friendly and smart. Prices are very reasonable. My 2 boys, daughter, parents, and 7 others I know absolutely love this place and are repeat very happy customers."}
{"text":"I love Don's!  Their calzones are amazing, my family enjoys their wings and pizza, and we fight over the garlic knots. Incredible customer service, staff is always super friendly and delivery is quite speedy."}
{"text":"UPDATE : they responded to me and told me I was gypsy , like how rude is that ? And then demanded I delete the review or they will never deliver to me again, as if I needed their days old pizza . They couldn't even apologize for their rude service , and then instead became more rude. Never have been so disrespected in my life."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. I called ahead to place my pick-up order and they told me it would be ready in about 15-20 minutes. I arrived about 20 minutes later, and told them I placed an order over the phone. I told them my name and paid them. Later I see the cashier tell the kitchen person what pizza I ordered, and then he started to make it. Waited about 12 minutes or so to receive my order. It was an honest mistake, so no big deal.   The pizza made up of it. It was hot, fresh, and man was it delicious. It had all the NY qualities. Gigantic (I got the XL), thin, and tons of grease (pepperoni pizza). The price is also not that bad and is cheaper than a few other places nearby. I'll definitely be back for more, and hopefully things run a little smoother the next time."}
{"text":"Pizza made the right way!  Thanks for coming to Az..For all the haters you might just want to try it first before bashing it.Give the guys a chance this is not imitation pizza but then again if you eat domino's all the time this might just throw your taste bud off!!!"}
{"text":"Neighborhood Favorite, go here all the time.  Love the Spinach and Mushroom Pizza Roll. Staff is always polite and helpful.  Delivery has always been great too.  The thin NY crust cheese is always a great choice.  Easy to add toppings to, when you just want a slice."}
{"text":"Searched high & low for our new pizza place once we knew we were relocating, to say the least to a native NYer is no easy task!! Well we don't need to look any further thank God!! Love the pizza it's as good as it gets being as far from NY as we are & anyone who says different isn't a born & raised NYer like this Long Island girl & they should stick with their coal fired pizza, case closed! They'll definitely be seeing a lot of us & I look forward to it even though my hips don't, LOL!!"}
{"text":"5 stars. Nothing more needed. Outstanding customer service and incredible pizza. If you're looking for a great place to relax and have a good time this is it!"}
{"text":"Little greasy but delicious! We were on vacation and stopped by for a slice before a baseball game. Great location by a baseball stadium."}
{"text":"We were skeptical of this place because of the location but were quickly impressed by the cleanliness of the restaurant and the friendly staff. We were given samples of food we were curious about and eventually ordered pasta dishes to go for our family. Everything was super tasty and we will be back again for sure. Amazing pasta and pizza"}
{"text":"I ordered from this place for the second time. I ordered two chicken fettuccine Alfredo meals ( one spicy). It was so delicious and the portions were more than enough. We both ended up having left overs. If you like Olive Garden you will enjoy this meal. The sauce is very similar and just as tasty. The delivery guy was very nice and prompt. I have also had the pizza from here which was good as well. I will definitely be ordering from this place again. My brother and I really enjoyed our lunch ."}
{"text":"If you like New York style pies this is the place to try! Only thing I can say the pizza is a bit in the greasy side but it's bomb! Looking forward to going back! The staff is down to earth. Not a fancy spot but you can still take the family and enjoy yourself"}
{"text":"NJ native here as well. The pizza is super salty. I actually felt my blood pressure go up! Not sure if it was the sauce or cheese. The cheese was mushy and the dough actually tasted and smelled musty. . Not sure if it's their water or the flour? Overall it's better than most Arizona pizza but not the best. Definitely not up to east coast standards."}
{"text":"I love this place so much..I moved in the area and I'm so happy I found my pizza spot..they have great manicotti as well as amazing yummy salads so not just pizza!!!"}
{"text":"This is definitely the best pizza we have found that delivers to us. The crust and sauce are fantastic, they are always quick and the prices are great. They just need to get a hotter wing sauce! We have tried most of the pizza around here and now we just call Dons."}
{"text":"Defiantly the best pizza in town! Caprese salad and calzone is amazing!  Great customer service!!!  Nice clean place!!!"}
{"text":"This is your average AZ New York style pizza joint. The cashier on the phone was pretty brutal to deal with. She was having a hard time remembering our large pepperoni half pineapple pizza. Had to read my card number twice to her over the phone.   Took 50 minutes to receive large pizza and wings. Pizza was very greasy and extremely salty. Not terrible, just ok and probably won't order from here unless we are in a bind. Wings were not great. Again, just what you would expect from your strip mall pizza joint. If people give this place 5 stars, I would say they have never lived anywhere but Az and don't know good authentic pizza!"}
{"text":"The employees at dons are terribly rude. The way they treat people is honestly disgusting. This was my favorite pizza place until today, I will never order from dons ever again."}
{"text":"We tried this place because of the reviews. The lasagna was very good and tasted homemade. I loved the garlic not and salad. I will visit again."}
{"text":"Bought Fried Zucchini from them a bunch of times in the past - all decent!  Bought some tonight - (2) 12 piece (4/21) and they were \"ALL\" WAY over-fried! Breading was the DARKEST that I have EVER had when ordering Fried Zucchini. Given the amount of times that I have ordered this item and the amount of times that they have screwed it up. . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . .  I'm DONE with this place. . . Sucks to be YOU! Should have just got some from Carl's Jr. . . . . They would have been WAY BETTER-!"}
{"text":"Pizza and wings last 2 timed sucked. I live less then a half a mile away but have to get it delivered because I have 2 special needs daughters in wheelchairs. Food took over an hour to get here.. Pizza's and wings were cold. Pizza had no flavor. The wings were dry and the container the wing in had sauce all over it but bag was clean.. The next morning I go out to throw the trash out and inside my garbage can was a torn bag with wing sauce and a rag with sauce all over it. Guess it spilt and he put it in a new bag and cleaned up the mess he made in his car. This is the second issue we had first time they messed up my calazon I asked for no ricotta and it was made with it called them back and they were closed. So my dog had dinner.. Not trying a 3rd time."}
{"text":"Simply Awesome! Great thin crust pizza. Great prices. Awesome flavor. Great lunch deals! Try both locations. Support Local! Stop eating at those chain locations. Bring an appetite!!"}
{"text":"You know, I never give food places reviews, but this place just has amazed me since the first time I stepped foot in the restaurant. They are always very pleasant no matter who I speak to. The food is really GOOD! Prices are great and I can just say its always just a pleasurable experience eating at Don's."}
{"text":"We get delivery from Don's a lot.  First time leaving a review. Everything had been amazing.  My daughters always ask if we can get \"The good pizza\".  That is what they call it. But hubby and I love love love their wings. They are simply the best wings we've ever eaten. I look forward to pizza/wing nights."}
{"text":"don's just opened up a month or so ago. I stopped in for lunch and get the lunch special 2 slices and a drink for like 5 bucks. The pizza is pretty legit New York pizza, big fold-able slices.  Checy crust on the outside and soft on the inside. The owner seemed super nice. I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza I have had in a long time. I don't even like thin crust pizza and my fiance ordered Ny style thin crust and it was by far the best thin crust. Their ranch is perfect too. It is some of the best home made dressing I have had. Not bitter or watery like some places. I can't wait to try some wings next time or a calzone."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite pizza joints and easily our favorite on the west side of Phoenix.  They have a great selection of menu items, good service, and great taste.  Please keep in mind that this review is about this west side (Avondale) pizza joint.  The pizza is great but this is not a hipster / trendy place like pizzeria bianco or other downtown locations.  We order our birthday party dinners from here and get late night pizza when we want something more than just a quick chain pizza.    This place has a freaky great menu full of pizzas different pizzas.  We have not had one we do not like.  And on top of that they have a good pasta, salad, wing, and calzone selection.  All of these items are great.  When a pizza joint sells a pasta that is so good you might get it instead, you have some great decisions to make.    Service is in the name.  It is Don's NY pizza.  We visited New York and would say the service feels just like that.  They are friendly and no nonsense.  It feels family owned and managed.  If they are not busy, they will gladly talk about anything, but if they are busy, probably get your pizza and move on.  They are not going to fall all over you, but they will treat you with respect and you will know the hands that went into every part of your pizza.    Finally the food tastes great.  We really have not found anything we did not like.  The pizza is a step up from any other we have found in our area.   The pastas are great, the wings have a great heat, and overall they do a great job.     So, if you live in this area, happen to be on the west side, or are driving through on the I-10, this is a great restaurant."}
{"text":"I loved this pizza!!! Good Pizza places are hard to find on this side of town so I'm glad I found one ! They have really good ny style pizza. Their crust is nice and chewy and the sauce very flavorful. We ordered the margarita  pizza.... The cheese was SO GOOD. Definitely tasted homemade. My only complaint was that the sauce was a little runny, but it was very flavorful. My new pizza place!"}
{"text":"In town for spring training, played a little morning golf and came home starving. Ordered a pizza and wings for me and a couple of the other guys and wow, Don's delivered literally and figuratively. Great pizza and their wings were excellent. Must try if you are in the Avondale area and looking for great pizza."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Phoenix and the most genuine NY we have found. We are so grateful we found this place!"}
{"text":"This is real deal NY Italian !!! Finally found real Italian food in AZ!!! Highly recommend!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza and so much more  Don's NY Pizza is reminiscent of the neighborhood pizzeria you remember visiting after school to grab a slice of pie with a coke, and relax with your friends.  Don's offers no-frills delicious pizza, served either by the slice, or as a whole pie. Don's makes their dough fresh daily and splash on a generous portion of homemade sauce then slather your pie with freshest toppings of your choice. This pie is the perfect combination of crispy crust, delicious sauce, and the perfect amount of toppings.  If you go to Don's New York Pizza you have to try the Margarita Pizza it's the best I've ever had, perfectly delicious as is the pepperoni and cheese pizza.  In addition, too delicious Don's offers salads, calzones, sandwiches, desserts, wings, pasta, and an assortment of appetizers. I can't wait to visit again and try other options off their menu.  So, If you are a pizza fan (and who is not?) You have to visit Don's you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery. It arrived on time.  The pizzas had no taste, couldnt even identify the meats on the meat lover pizza,  soggy crust is the worst. I wont be oredering here again."}
{"text":"I decided to give Dons NY pizza a try since they we're so close to my house. When I went to get my pies there was a hostess a waitress and the guy cooking the pies behind the counter. Nobody even said hello to me which I thought was rude. I had to tell the waitress what I was there for.The pizza was kinda bland nothing to right home about.Kinda pricey too the total came to 28.00 dollars for 2 large one topping pizzas.Don't think I will be eating there again."}
{"text":"Ordered from Don's for lunch/dinner, since it's right down the street from us and wanted to try something new. Ordered the turkey sub, wings, and spaghetti. I rated three stars because when I called to order our food for pick up, I double checked to ensure no onions would come on my sub and when I got it.. there were plenty of onions on it.  Overall: Fantastic food! Wings were the best I've had from pizza places around here."}
{"text":"We ordered a calzone, fried zucchini, fried mushrooms, and a chicken parmesan hero.  What came was a calzone, fried zucchini, fried mushrooms, and a chicken linguine dinner. The lady misunderstood us I guess. So when we called then up.  They brought the chicken parmesan hero out for free. Even though we offered to pay for it.  That was very nice of them. Thank you Don' s NY for your excellent costumer service."}
{"text":"Was told to give this place a try. I ordered a NY supreme pizza and 48 wings. Picked it up and toon it home. It was one of the best pizzas I've had I a long time. Fresh cheese meat and the vegetables on the pizza where cooked. The Wings where great also. Crispy with a ton of sauce.  Their ranch that came with the wings was amazing. It's not your normal ranch. It had some type of garlic powder in it. Delicious. I will be back."}
{"text":"Really good NY pizza in a convenient spot  In Glendale, Az  Authentic New York style Bread & cheese, excellent"}
{"text":"This place truly has amazing pizza!  The buffalo chicken pizza was phenomenal!  Wings are ok but it's all about the pizza here! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I have the pleasure of saying I work there.Adrian is awesome the food is great the pepperoni Calazone is my favorite thing right now. I think I will try a meatball , pepperoni and cheese sandwich."}
{"text":"Seriously the best pizza in the west valley. The staff is always so nice and the food is always fresh and delicious! Highly recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"Their pizza ROCKS, their salads are AWESOME, their subs are DELICIOUS and they DELIVER...I am in heaven. I have waited so long for any decent delivery, my pizza prayers have been answered. The food is fantastic and the prices are very reasonable, thank you thank you for coming to the neighborhood. I will tell you that I am a pizza snob so when I praise I really mean it because Domino's and Papa John's are pure crap and I refuse to order or even eat that crap."}
{"text":"I literally started drooling after I took a huge bite into the lasagna... Also the pizza WAS FLAT OUT AMAZING! considering the family owned buisness is from NY. The staff is always friendly & I cannot wait to order from here every Friday night, straight key to success!"}
{"text":"Excellent pasta and really fast delivery, very pleasant delivery man. Will definitely be ordering from here often!"}
{"text":"I've tried several items over the past weeks, and WOW!  I recommend the Pizza Rolls or the cheese steaks"}
{"text":"Chicken wings are on point . have had a hard time finding good wings here . Being from Western New York our wings are hard to beat."}
{"text":"I'm so thankful that Don's is literally right around the corner from my house. My family and I order pretty regularly as their food is delicious and their staff is super friendly.   Usually twice a month we will order a pizza and two cannolis. While I prefer the standard cheese pizza (it's a classic) we also really love their margherita pizza as well. The large is perfect for us to eat our fill and have leftovers. Let me just say that their pizza is also awesome as a hangover curing next-day cold pizza too. Their NY style thin crust has enough crunch but the crust also has the right amount of chew. So good. Their sauce also is top notch.   All in all, the friendly staff, scrumptious food and close proximity to home makes this place a complete package. I plan to continue my ongoing patronage."}
{"text":"The pizza is my favorite pizza I've ever eaten! And this is coming from someone who tries hard to find real NY pizza. It is not like Pizza Hut. So people who are used to Chuck E Cheese and Peter Piper will likely freak out over the grease and real cheese that is on it! The sauce is sweet and there isn't too much. Toppings always great. The sandwiches are amazing too."}
{"text":"Really battled over four or five stars but given I can't really fault any part of our grub I am going to roll with the five star rating, but think 4.5 is most accurate. The prices were good and staff was very outgoing. You could tell they had been working all day but still provided good conversation. As for the pie, we went with a cheese and a pepperoni. Both were very large and hot when picked up. My daughter and her friends devoured them and my wife and I were fortunate enough to get a couple slices. The pie was tasty and had just the right amount of all ingredients. We also ordered an antipasta salad that was good, but did lack a little heat. Overall, price was right and the pies were on point. Would hit this place up again if in the area."}
{"text":"Great pizza, the salads are good and big. My husband really like the wings. Good customer service"}
{"text":"After being in the car for 10 hours we arrived at our hotel in Glendale. After checking around for pizza places, we finally found Don's NY Pizza. We ordered the special of a 16\" pizza and 20 wings for $22.95.  We also added sausage to the pizza.   This was WAY too much food for 2 adults and 3 children. The pizza is good. The slices are large and thin which makes them perfect for folding. The cheese is gooey and greasy and delicious. We also ordered three side salads ($3). The salad comes with lettuce, red onions, cucumber, tomatoes and olives.   The wings are good. We ordered half mild half spicy. There is a lot of meat on the wings and the sauce is tasty.   But the total came out to $41.40....so, I don't know how that happened. Unless it cost $6 to add sausage to pizza...???"}
{"text":"Mike, took my order and was a pleasure, very nice! The food was delicious. Garlic knots were just how they are in NY!! So glad to have found this place!"}
{"text":"I was having high hopes for this pizza joint since it is conveniently located near my home but based on taste I would only give it half a star. So I ordered the NY supreme I think that was the name. Cheese was waxy, not sure if it was real mozzarella or the cheap imitation cheese. Bell pepper was soggy and tasted like canned, although I've never even seen canned just didn't taste fresh. No wow factor to the pizza, I should have just stuck to Papa John's or Domino's. Pizza was expensive so yes of course I was expecting good pizza at least decent pizza.  So why 2 stars you ask? Well based on customer service  they actually deserve 5 stars, everyone was so friendly and welcoming but lets be honest I just wanted some good pizza, won't be ordering from them any time soon."}
{"text":"I most say it's hard to find good pizza and wings these days. I tried this place in hoping to find a new pizza place and boy was I right. The pizza was fresh and great in taste. The wings were a good size a couple were big which is normal to get. A lot of other places have wings little with hardly no meat. Great pizza and wings definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"I just had the lasagna it comes with 4 garlic knots and a salad, it was really really good. Once again I have not been disappointed, the staff is really nice and considerate. More and more people are coming in."}
{"text":"If not the best pizza around the Peoria area. We seek and seek then we find. Can't wait for the next pie and the wings are good too. What else is good? I guess I'll find out the hard way."}
{"text":"This was our first visit. The hubs had a taste for lasagna and Yelper's voted this as #1. They were not wrong.  The lasagna comes with salad and garlic knots. The flavors were amazing and the portions are more than generous. A single serving could easily be shared between 2 adults or 4-6 children. (Depending on ages and appetites) The salad boasts lettuce, red onions, black olives, tomatoes, cucumber, and a banana pepper. The informal atmosphere makes it an ideal family night out. Not in the mood for lasagna? The couple sitting next to us gave the pizza two thumbs up. And everyone went home with leftovers."}
{"text":"So my family and I came here once before we recently came back for a catered birthday party for my son. The staff hustles and happen to be very friendly. We had a huge order of wings which were delicious. Nice and crispy with no weird texture like some places give you. We had the white deluxe both times we went and loved that. Also had some pepperoni and pepperoni plus sausage pizzas as well. Those all met our pizza expectations. They also garlic knots which are a nice appetizer plus the bruschetta for a nice touch. I'm not a big fan of pasta but I did try my grandpa's baked ziti which was delicious. My mother in law had the penne Alla vodka which she seemed to love. This is place is worth coming to and I suggest it over guses right across the street."}
{"text":"Pizza is greasy, ordered a small caesars salid for $3.50 and got 4 bites of romaine lettuce and 5 croutons."}
{"text":"Ordered the NY Supreme pizza and it was so good.  The crust was perfect, it was cooked good and had a great mix of topping.  I would order this again and again."}
{"text":"Came here to check it out and was in the mood for pizza. They are a new establishment I believe, but it's a simple place and the staff are great. They helped us choose and see all the specials, we also came in less than an hour before closing and they were still cool about everything. The pizza role is what I got and it was amazing, cooked well and garnished nicely. The service they give you is really neat as well!"}
{"text":"Great service friendly and efficient. The baked ziti was excellent absolutely delicious. The salad dressing was great as well. My chicken parmigiana was ok but I will try it again before I judge. Overall the entire experience was a back home NYC feel and I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Great pizza , wings were good as well...been looking for a new spot...think we found it.."}
{"text":"Bravo. A real calzone oozing with luscious RICOTTA and mozzarella.  Not a ricottaless stromboli called a calzone. I got sausage mushroom and spinach. Can't wait to try Chicken Francese and spicy alfredo. Marinara sauce topnotch. I never usually use the ubiquitous cup that comes with a calzone but this stuff was the bomb."}
{"text":"White Deluxe slice is my favorite from Don's. Delicious every time no matter which brother bakes this pie. I've had the plain slice too from the Peoria spot. Such nice warm people behind the counter. Can't wait until that construction is finished over there, but doesn't keep me from that white deluxe slice.  Don't change those ingredients DON'S."}
{"text":"Another amazing meal... Pizza is my favorite and their baked pasta dishes are the best... Totally reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"Being from Pennsylvania- I struggle with finding pizza out here in AZ that satisfies my craving for NY style pizza. This place absolutely did the job! I will absolutely become a regular."}
{"text":"First time here.. Ordered the lasagna dinner.. Came with salad and 4 garlic knots! Portion was huge!! Best ranch ever also!! Really good sauce as well...will def be back!! Food is def on point!!"}
{"text":"Although this place is just a few miles from us, we found it on Yelp! We were craving wings, especially because we had wings from another place a few days ago and they really didn't hit the spot. We ordered the XL pizza, 24 wings and 2L soda special for $26. What a great deal for our family! Plus I ordered delivery, because who wants to load up the kids in the car seats on a Friday night?! Anyways, it came right about 30 minutes later piping hot. I noticed right away how HUGE the XL pizza was. The pizza was great! I'm from the east coast and like NY style pizza. I would say the pizza crust had the chewiness of east coast pizza, but a little like west coast pizza, it was really good! We had the medium wings and the heat was just right. The size of the wings were about medium. I will definitely order again and try some of the other menu items! Glad I found this place!"}
{"text":"My current favorite pizza!!! Cheesy, not greasy and true NY slices. 4 stars because the seating inside leaves a lot to be desired but hey, we just pick up our pie now!"}
{"text":"Now I'm not a big pizza person but after my husband and I went to NYC in March I loved the pizza there! So I've been on the search for the closest thing to NYC pizza I could find out here (on the west side) and this definitely met my expectations! Good, thin crust, not a crazy amount of sauce which I hate, a bit greasy but it's pizza and that's flavor. Really good!"}
{"text":"Price is on point at this place!  If you want a filling meal for a little damage to the wallet definitely try this place out.   That said, food is mediocre for an Italian spot, the pasta meats are not made from scratch (they never claimed such). I'd say this place has way better pasta then Olive Garden if that helps.   All in all I will probably be back at some point."}
{"text":"I love your pizza it's amazing but it was ruined  Thursday october 6th. My husband bought pizza around 9pm when I was at work. I came home and opened the pizza ready to eat and noticed that maybe your driver or maker was in a hurry. Half of the pizza toppings were stuck to the top of the box and the side of it were smooshed by the edges of the box. I will continue ordering from here cause I love this place but please take care of the pizza its love and when love is ruined its no good."}
{"text":"I just moved into the surrounding area and this pizza place delivers to my house 15 minutes away. Seeing as I'm not a fan of anything chain, I decided to give this place a shot. I would like to say- I am so glad I did. The Margharita is hands down MY FAVORITE and my son loves the pepperoni. I order it all the time. Staff is friendly, pizza is superb. Awesome little place!"}
{"text":"Spicy chicken Alfredo, margarita pizza, wings,... Everything is really good! We order from there more often then any other place and try different things almost every time. They have proven themselves to be a great delivery dinner."}
{"text":"This is the best NY style pizza I've ever had in Arizona. It reminds me of the pizza from back home. Delicious! I will definitely be bringing my friends and family here. Also, reasonable prices and very clean! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We LOVE Don's pizza. It's exactly how a pizza should look and taste. You can really taste the flavor in the pizza sauce too. We also get the spicy chicken Alfredo which is hands down the best Alfredo I have gotten from a restaurant. The staff is always friendly when we call or go pick up. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"NJ native here, always looking for a good fold-able slice of pie and I saw Yelp loves this new place so I though I would give it a try....but when specifically looking for it it was very difficult to find.  It's on the east side (closer to loop 101) of the parking lot with Home Depot.  Upon entering I was greeted promptly and noticed a very fine selection of slices even though I came in at 3pm.  Got the 2 slices plus a drink special for around $6.  Mushroom pepperoni was my first pic.  A lot of cheese, fantastic fold-ability and the crust.  Molto Bene!   ***FUN FACT*** the reason we fold slices back East is because you won't burn your tongue or roof of your mouth with bread on both sides. (picture the 'more you know' cartoon from NBC)"}
{"text":"My husband and I are from California. We were on our way to our cousins house saw this place on our way and decided to stop by. Best pizza I had so far in Arizona. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"My wife and I can't seem to get enough of Dons pizza! It has beat out any pizza place we've ordered from in the past and is definitely our go to for the nights we don't feel like cooking. The employees are always friendly and delivery is always prompt. Doesn't get any better than that!!"}
{"text":"Recommended by a friend who is from NY.  So I decided to give it a try.  Did not disappoint.  Good pizza, delicious spaghetti and great lunch specials.  Good buffalo wings too."}
{"text":"Moving here from NY it's pretty hard to find pizza you like. This place is awesome. I would drive 15 minutes to get pizza here, when I finally moved to a new place it turned out that dons delivered. I was so excited. We order pizza here like twice a week!"}
{"text":"This place opened rather recently near our house and we have already ordered from them twice. Their pizza is very good NY style pizza. We have gotten the Margarita, the meat lovers, and the white pizza. They are all delicious but the white pizza is my favorite. It is nice and garlicky and I love the dollops of ricotta. The mozzarella Cheese is the good chewy cheese...know what I mean? We have also gotten their wings...nothing to write home about but I'm not mad about it. The caprese salad was very fresh and a generous portion. We also got the eggplant parm with penne pasta. I'm not normally a marinara kinda gal...but even I liked it. And the eggplant parm was nicely breaded with good flavor. I see this place being our regular pizza joint for delivery from now on. And the delivery guys have both been very friendly which I appreciate. Keep it up and you guys will be in business for the long run"}
{"text":"I've lived here for 14 years and this is the first decent, non-chain pizza place yet.  Great crust!"}
{"text":"Friendly on the phone.  Arrived quickly.  Looked and tasted great. Things they could work on... teach the crew to cut through the crust, and cut in 6-8 slices,  not 12.  Feels wrong not being able to fold a slice from an 18\" ny pizza.  Other than that,  was awesome!"}
{"text":"Disappointed! Ordered a sicilian pizza Friday  night, threw the pizza away.  I will say the wings were good.  I may try a thin crust in the future, but the sicilian never again. The stars are for  the wings."}
{"text":"Straight fire. Best pizza I've had in awhile. The cannolis were sooooooooooooooo good. Will return again and again."}
{"text":"Being a native New Yorker, I am always on the look out for authentic NY style pizza and this is it! I ordered a NY supreme pizza for my boyfriend and I ordered a regular calzone with pepperoni and both were delicious! I was able to place a to go order right and have it ready right before they closed. Everything was delicious and perfect! Highly highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Best food on the west side!  Every time we've eaten there, the food is delicious.  Pizza, subs,  calzones, outstanding!  The price, a little on the high side, the quality of the food makes it worth it. Give the place a try."}
{"text":"Great pizza, great wings, poor customer service would have gave it a 5 star review.. it seems like the staff hate there lives they can't even make eye contact very short and blunt unprofessional in my eyes only going back for the pizza and wings guess I'll half to suck it up until a friendly pizza parlor who is on par with the quality pizza until then dons it is"}
{"text":"I would rate this 2nd best in the Valley next to Spinatos. Good service,  fresh toppings, great savory sauce. No complaints."}
{"text":"I love your pizza, but today I ordered 2 Chicken Parmigiana subs and they weren't up to par. The meat was vey tough and tasted old. I also ordered a medium sized antipasto salad and the ham was spoiled and no dressing was included.Needless to say, I was very disappointed. Perhaps I should just stick to your pizza."}
{"text":"First time trying out this place with my fiancé and we LOVED it! We got the white pizza deluxe, some BBQ wings, mozzarella sticks, and garlic knots. And everything was AMAZING! Employees were really friendly too! We definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Great pizza place! Family friendly, delicious food, clean restaurant, nice staff! We will definitely be back and use for delivery from now on!!!"}
{"text":"We were in from out of town and needed something to eat... this pizza was the BEST! We have craved good NY style pizza where we live in Utah, we have no good options. Don's was so yummy, perfect amount of cheese, perfect crust, great toppings. Basically the perfect pizza. Garlic knots and salad were good too. We all made ourselves sick because we couldn't stop eating! We called in our order to pickup and it was super fast and ready when we got there. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Yelp you did it again. My wife and I had rough days and then you gave me a notice of new restaurants in the area and we found this gem. Pizza and wigs were amazing and they were so friendly and accommodating to our young family. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Went to Don's for the first time tonight. We got a x-large cheese pizza, chicken parm sandwich, meatball parm sandwich and chicken piccata dinner. Everything was delicious. It's a taste of New York. They are from Brooklyn, the best city in the world. Maybe I am biased because I am too. We tried a bunch of different dishes and each one was terrific. Can't wait to go back and try the Chicken Francese dinner, calzone, Chicken Alfredo and cheese cake. Welcome to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Great food and price. For Peoria this is over the top pizza. Not a lot of good places to eat in this area so give it a shot. Plus the staff are nice and helpful"}
{"text":"Great little pizza joint. Not fancy pizza but they have landed he New York pies so you can stroll in for a slice. Their knots are a must have. Support local and stop in. Nice to have a decent little place this side of town."}
{"text":"So I decided to order delivery Friday night. They arrived pretty fast. I ordered the special, a large pepperoni pizza with 20 wings. I was happy with the wings. Greatly disappointed with the pizza. The dough was rubbery and there was a puddle of grease!  I had to remove the pizza from the Box and use paper towels to pat down the pizza. Never had this issue with Barro's. I doubt we will be ordering from Don's again. Next time I will take the time to drive for quality."}
{"text":"Found my new Pizza Spot:) Totally beats Barros. Sauce is delicious and crust is thin and crispy. It was very pleasant to eat. We ordered the Margarita Pizza. I can't wait to try the rest of the selections on the Menu. It's refreshing to have a good pizza place in the neighborhood"}
{"text":"This place is great! The food is so good. My husband and I are never disappointed. This is the 3rd time  we have ordered from here and the food is excellent everytime!  You can tell they take pride in preparing and making sure the food is fresh and hot. The ingredients are fresh and you can tell that in every order.  We will definitely keep ordering from here as long as they keep cooking and preparing their food fresh like they do.  Thank you to the staff and chef for taking pride in your food preparation. Believe me your customers really appreciate it! Bon appetite everyone#happycustomer#goodplacetoeat."}
{"text":"Place is Bomb! We're pizza lovers and this place didn't fail us at all. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"So our first visit, ordered our food for pick up got home and it was cold. Called and just asked for a refund and the guy said okay just bring it back that's fine. Brought it back was questioned and insulted. Owners kid claimed everything was perfect and started tasting it in front of us. Then started yelling that this was the best we would ever have. All I wanted was a refund. Worst customer service and shows how indecent the people who own this shop are. Don't dislike their food you'll hear it !"}
{"text":"This place  is very family-friendly and you would think you're in New York itself. The food is phenomenal as well as the service I've had no better in the state of Arizona"}
{"text":"While staying at the Comfort Suites, we didn't want to have to get dressed and drive somewhere and checked Yelp.  YAY!  With a quick call, a half hour later our our pizza was delivered hot and fresh and exactly the way we ordered it.  Delicious pizza. Good crust.Plenty of toppings, my only request is that when doing a delivery to a hotel, please include packets of parm, peppers and some paper plates."}
{"text":"I order food from here within the last hour and a half due to the fact it was rated over four and a half stars on Google. I was extremely excited to try it out as I have not had New York style pizza for quite some time. The customer service when I called was great he was very attentive and seems very sweet, but that's where the satisfaction ended. Thankfully it did come in a timely manner hence the generous 2 star rating, but that's the only other positive. To begin the driver did not have any fresh red chili or parmesan to accompany the pizza, though I never requested it; I never thought I needed to. When the pizza arrived it was semi warm at best it seems a pizza had been sitting for a couple of hours, because the crust was stale and the center was soggy. I will not be returning to this business nor would I recommend it, it's a shame because I was looking forward to a 4.7 rating Pizza and got nothing remotely close."}
{"text":"Fuhgettaboutit!! Best NY pizza outside NYC! Great customer service and they keep the grated cheese in the fridge not on the table."}
{"text":"This place is by far the best pizza place Ive found in Arizona whenever I stay in town  I surely come here and eat a slice of pizza and lasagna customer service is really great pizza looks really fresh love this place"}
{"text":"Amazing food, huge portions you just got to try it. Had the two slices deal with the free soda and it was f****** huge. And you gotta understand something, I'm a big guy I'm like 280. If I'm telling you this was almost too much food it's almost too much food it's f****** phenomenal. The sausage and pepperoni to cheese the dough it all works man it all works beautifully together nothing's too much or too little is just f****** delicious. I've worked at several different kinds of pizza places Chicago New York the chains this is as good if not better than all of them. I put Rosati's up there with them."}
{"text":"Best pizza and wings I've ever had in Arizona, everything was so delicious! Will definitely come back again and again!!!"}
{"text":"I am old Italian Momma from NJ living in Peoria Az and I didn't think I would fine Italian food that I would make as good as my own and my mothers but I did ! You will not be disappointed with their menu... their taste or service ! I highly recommend that you should order in or deliver it out ... anything on the menu is great! Enjoy Mangiare ...Mangiare"}
{"text":"I go to both locations and I'm never disappointed. Their prices are extremely reasonable and the food is delicious. You can't ask for a better pizza place! Watch out Sardella's they're coming for you!"}
{"text":"WINGS. GET THEM. Pizza was tastey, and deliver was awesome! Back in Virginia it would take about an hour, Don's only took just over half an hour. Be sure to check out their daily specials."}
{"text":"The wings!!  Some of the best we've had.  We did carryout on Saturday then got delivery the following Tuesday because they were so good!  We also have the pizza. It wasn't my favorite but I'm willing to try it again! The service both on the phone and in person was great and so was the delivery guy. I love that they delivered to our house!"}
{"text":"This is my go to place for spaghetti with meat sauce. comes with salad made fresh when you order and 4 garlic knots. Glad something decent has finally opened in the area. go there once a week minimum to get my fix. Pizza is good too."}
{"text":"We had my birthday party here and they are awesome. They never disappoint. The food is delicious the service is great. We just moved to the area and this is our new favorite pizza spot. We love this place"}
{"text":"The fried mushrooms were awesome! Pepperoni pizza was great, good crust. Wings were great, we got BBQ and hot, only thing is I would like a little more heat on the wings. The ranch is good too, finally found a good pizza place that delivers."}
{"text":"Pizza and salad were sooooo good. Will be ordering from here again & again & again.  Best pizza in the neighborhood. Free delivery was great."}
{"text":"I came here on Halloween and the pizza was amazing. The girl working the register provided the best customer service I've ever experienced , very professional , and deserves a promotion. I'm very eager to try their pastas !!! Overall , I'd recommend this place to anyone. It's the closest you'll get to authentic NY style here in Arizona."}
{"text":"From the outside, Don's does not look like anything special.....let's be honest.... from the inside, Don's doesn't look like anything special.... but, surprisingly, it is! I got a calzone from Don's and it was ridiculously good. They said they make their own ricotta..... the cheese did not disappoint. Their prices are reasonable....their food was awesome....they're open late.... the only bad thing about this place is how far they are from my house! If you're in Peoria, stop wasting your time with other pizza joints....this is your place!"}
{"text":"Ordered calzones tonight......and they were delicious. Love their ricotta cheese. Not the first time we ordered from this location. They are super nice when you order and even when you pick up."}
{"text":"Average pizza. Didn't like the wings. Service was decent, and they got us the food quick. Just didn't think it was very good."}
{"text":"Pizza and wings are delicious!! Pizza super super hott when coming out and wings really crispy! Def recommend!"}
{"text":"This pizza is FANTASTIC!!!! The crust (which I don't normally like) is so delicious, they don't skimp on toppings, and the staff is so accommodating! The white pizza is the best I've had outside of the east coast. My mom has a dairy allergy and is able to get really great pizza without the cheese. They always pile on the toppings for her  Highly recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"I live a block from this pizza place, and when they delivered the pizza was so nasty. Not cooked all the way, the wings were so horrible. No one ate it. Never again will we order from there."}
{"text":"So I am going to give it 5 stars on my first visit. First I can say that being a New Yorker (Long Island) I am a pizza snob. I even worked in a pizza place back in the 1980's in Ronkonkoma. I was expecting a disappointing pizza but what I got was really good. I had a large Meat lovers. The staff was friendly and funny.   I was told the pizza would be done in 15 minutes and it was.  Overall, I will definitely be going back next time I visit."}
{"text":"The Pizza was pretty good, NY style pie. The Garlic Knots- not the best in town, kinda bland though the dipping marinara sauce was pretty good. They have very nice service, friendly folks. I loved that they are from Brooklyn."}
{"text":"For some reason it shows I have been here before but I have not??  It was dinner time so off to Don's we went. I/we was blown away by their pizza and service. On entering we were greeted by smiles from everyone. Like they enjoyed being there and serving you. We ordered a thin curst MNY supreme pizza. Sat down and waited for our pizza. During this time several people came out to check on us. During this time I had time to look around and discovered the place is clean, clean. Clean enough to eat off the floor. Not a smug anywhere.  Our pizza came and it was perfect. Just the way I/we like it. I don't believe it could of been better and the best pizza I can remember eating. Then more service. As we ate someone came our several times to check if everything was ok and the pizza was to our liking. Yes it was and this made us feel pretty special.  There are several pizza places close. probably 6 within a mile of Dom's\, we have tried them all over the years. This is the best we have had by a long way.. I know where my next pizza is coming from. Yours should be also. Just got back from my second visit. WoW, Just as good as the first or maybe better.  The people that work here are their best. Customer service? They must of wrote the book. They excel in every aspect.  Go see them you are missing out if you don't."}
