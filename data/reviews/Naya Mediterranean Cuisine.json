{"text":"Our meal on Saturday night was a disaster from start to finish. We arrived for our 7PM reservation and stood waiting at the door for over ten minutes while cold gusts of wind hit us each time the door opened. It also gave us a chance to hear the awful electronic piano music which was way too loud.

Seated at our table near the kitchen we sensed that providing good service and preparing and serving acceptable food would be a challenge in a room that was filled to it's over 200 seat capacity. Our harried waitress was pleasant but not suited to the task. She was clumsy at taking our order and never cleared a dish or made sure that our table was cleared when needed. Our baba ghanouj appetizer was a tasteless, watery mess accompanied by pieces of pita bread that were equally bland and tasteless. Over an hour into our sitting the main courses had not arrived. Our waitress seemed aware of the delay and the owner stopped by our table to apologize for the delay. When our main courses came out we were really dismayed. My wife's salmon was a tail piece sliced so thin that there was no chance of it not being overcooked. My kafta kabob looked like the charred remains of something deposited in a dog park. The rice was pasty and the vegetables were limp zucchini, red peppers and onions scooped from a vat. After the waitress tried to replace my wife's salmon with an equally bad piece, the owner came over to tell us we would not be charged for our meal.

Bottom line. Nice people who have no clue of how to run a restaurant on the scale of Naya. It is a big room and they do not know how to manage it. The food is dreadful and I have no reason to believe that they know how to do better. Stay away."}
{"text":"the food was good and had very nice presentation.
we had: 
mezza combo
steak and hummus
fried kebbeh
makanek
falafel
mossaka

its more expensive than what i thought it would be."}
{"text":"My husband and I just got home from a fabulous dining experience at Naya. We were among the very first diners at Naya tonight.... We didn't't realize it opened at 5:00 for dinner service. We were warmly welcomed by the owner.
We shared  the Mezza Combo which contained Baba Ghanouj, Hummus, Tabbouleh Salad,Stuffed Grape Leaves, and other goodies.
My husband got Lamb Chops; I got Shish Tawouk which was marinated chicken on skewers. The plate also had veggies and rice. We ended our dinner with a warm dessert made of FILO dough and sweet cheese topped with Rose water. It was good.... Not great.
In a word: DELICIOUS! We really enjoyed our dinner. 
Our server was very knowledgable about the menu. She was extremely pleasant and our food came out the proper temperature. The owner came to our table to make sure we were happy with the food.
We will definitely return to Naya..... That is FOR SURE!!"}
{"text":"I just don't get it. Is it Lebanese or Italian? in my opinion you shouldn't mix both. I have had better Lebanese food in the phoenix metro area. Chicken Kebob was very dry, kofta kabob wasn't seasoned very well. Grape leaves look like they are out of a can."}
{"text":"This place was great.  I took my wife here for her birthday.  Very disappointed to learn it has closed. :("}
{"text":"Wow.. The ambiance very modern and romantic .. And they have live jazz music going that complements everything .. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I ate here a few weeks ago with a group of eight.  I often order two appetizers rather than an entree because I like to taste as many things as possible.  I decided to have the Mezza Combo for two (hummus, baba ghanouj, grape leaves, tabbouleh salad and olives) and the Makanek (Lebanese sausage w/fries and garlic sauce). 

The sausage and fries had what was likely a sauce from the pan drippings and it was so good I couldn't stop eating it.    I know that some things are a matter of taste but I particularly liked the tabbouleh because it didn't have too much lemon or parsly but was still well seasoned.   In most restaurants that I've had grape leaves they've always been too acetic for my taste but these were not.  I was also able to have a taste of the cheese fatayer (filo dough stuffed with halloumi cheese/herbs and baked).  I will order it the next time I go here.

The rest of the group also had several appetizers and wine.  Everyone was happy with their selections. I don't drink at all if I'm driving but some of my friends are okay with having a glass of wine with dinner and driving.  From their comments this was one area where the restaurant could probably improve.  None of them were particularly happy with the selection and had to taste a couple of wines before finding one acceptable and there are not super picky people."}
{"text":"WOW! WOW! And WOW! I could rave about the food but I would much rather tell you about the delictable social experience. If you crave traditional, sophisticated, and we care about your whole experience....THEN this is where you must eat! The customer service is fit for royalty and oh yeah the food is the pinacle of perfection. Ramon...best server ever! I had the Jenne Penney with a side of the whipped garlic, lemon and oil....orgasmic. You must try this place :)"}
{"text":"This place was just okay.  The food I felt was mediocre however the service was very good.  There was no one in the restaurant when I went which seemed a little bizarre.  I had the chicken kabob and it wasn't that great.  The chicken seemed a little dry and kinda bland. Overall just average."}
{"text":"Walked in on saturday night. Restaurant half empty but was turned away cuz no reservation (along with 2 other parties)! Promptly booked reservations on opentable and got seated. Food good but service and general operations will doom this place to a short life:("}
{"text":"When I walked into Naya for the first time, it reminded Bloom immediately (the restaurant that was here before Naya.) I can't believe the layout is still the same, even the half circled booths are still the same!

Taking advantage of restaurant week deal, a group of 6 stopped here for dinner. I'm surprised how their restaurant week menu consists very little Mediterranean flavor. First course are 3 kinds of salad (house, caesar and caprese), but no greek salad, or maybe some hummus? Second course are choices among filet mignon, salmon and chicken masala. Third course dessert are choices between creme brûlée and a pistachio flavored 'bird nest' pastry.

1st course - Caprese salad, very simple yet nice presentation. (but it's also not easy to mess up with mozzarella, tomato and bass, isn't it?) The taste was decent. 
2nd course - Filet Mignon. My medium rare filet was cooked just right, but somehow the temperature was a little cold. The side of fries tasted good, but way too oily, and the steamed veggies are not worth to be on a normally cost $32 plate, sorry, but those only belong to your corner diner. 
3rd course -Creme Brûlée, this was surprisingly good with some fresh berries! It was probably the best of the night.

The restaurant was about half full throughout our dinner time, but for some reason, service was quite slow. Overall, I was in a Mediterranean restaurant, but my dishes seemed somewhat more american, and the taste was mediocre, i don't know if I would pay the regular price for the same thing again."}
{"text":"Looked for a new place for lunch today. I love Mediterranean food and thought we would try this place out. The service was good but the food was sub par. Hummus needs more garlic and lemon :("}
{"text":"Gosh this place is stellar. I could not believe how great the hummus was, and its only $6.. I love trying new places, so I will not be back, but even with this, I loved it! Great seasoning and quality Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"Met friends at this establishment and was very surprised with the modern atmosphere, the service was fantastic, the meal was delicious, with a variety of drinks and even a specialty drink of the day."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for our anniversary dinner, and it was an appropriate venue for the occasion.  Lighting was very dark, which was nice for a romantic mood.  Worked well for us, but we noticed some middle-aged folks struggling to read the menu, so they were using their cell-phone flash lights.  Staff was very nice and accommodating.  Hummus was tasty.  Lebanese sausages (appetizer) was a unique experience but I think you'd have to develop a taste for it.  Chicken marsala was very good.  Tiramasu was also very good.  We shared the entree for an extra $4 and that got us two vege plates instead of just one.  Over-all it was a very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Beautiful place. I was there last night for birthday dinner, Love the appetizers( hummus, baba ghanouj) , kafta kebab, fatoush and ladyfinger for desert. 
The best Mediterranean Cusine in Arizona!"}
{"text":"Thank god the food was great! Service was so bad!"}
{"text":"Visited Naya for the first time tonight with a group of 5 and had a great time.  Echoing other reviewers, the Baba Ghanouj is literally the best I have ever tasted.  Our group was having a casual business dinner, and the staff was extremely polite, helpful, and accommodating.  We had the Mezze Combo to start and then our group had several of the kebab dishes, falafel and several salads.

We also appreciated the really personal service.  Our group had some work to do and the staff was very helpful, checking in occasionally to see if we needed anything.  I highly recommend this for the food and service, as well as for the relaxing atmosphere.  Not too loud and very pleasant all around.  I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"The food was OK but there is very little in the way of mediterranean dishes on the lunch menu.  A couple of salads but no meat dishes.  The rest of the lunch items were Italian dishes.  Very strange."}
{"text":"Came from LA where we had many options for mediterranean food. This was nothing short of fantastic!!!  I will be back for sure and I'm not always easily impressed.  These guys did it right!"}
{"text":"Many excellent Mediterranean/Middle Eastern restaurants inPhoenix. 
This is NOT one.
Prices are low, they match the quality.

FOOD:  
Descriptions fine -  results  AWFUL: 
-Spinach Pie - crust was cardboard;
- Kebbah Senieh - dreadful dry mashup with overpowering cinnamon; 
- Lamb Chops - two thin fatty chops with barely any meat on them; 
- Chicken Marsala - thin chicken breast had never been near marsala wine, covered with canned mushrooms ; 
- Desserts -  no menu, no dessert tray, just trust the server!

SERVICE: 
Server was busy with her other job, didn't listen to what we wanted, 
didn't check how our food tasted. 
Wait staff  better, filled glasses, asked before clearing plates.

Not what you'd expect from a Fox restaurant."}
{"text":"Best Baba Gannoush, Hummus, fried Kibbe. Great salads and soups at lunch time. Happy Hour is amazing, too. Try one of the fancy mixed drinks - they are fun.  I ate here yesterday and logged into Yep to write it up. Was happy to see that the review of the day is for Naya!!  Great foodie minds must think alike. Agree on all points - the atmosphere is beautiful and the food really delivers. Anyone else have that great kale, romaine, red quinoa, dried cherry salad yesterday? I could live on it.   Have eater here at least 10 times, sometimes with groups of 6 or so, and have never been disappointed.  LOVE Naya!"}
{"text":"This is absolutely the best authentic Arabic food around. The staffs fantastic, the food fresh, healthy and memorable. Great place to take friends and family and share in the appetizers."}
{"text":"The ambience and decor is amazing and the place was empty. Just our table and like 2 people at the bar. The food was very mediocre especially for the overpriced menu. The hummus with beef tasted good but the rest of the entrée only looked good. I guess I expected a lot from the looks of the place but as they say \"DON'T JUDGE A BOOK BY IT'S COVER\" Ordered a Mai Tai and I thought it very much tasted like flavored water. See my pix but remember it looks a lot better then it tasted. I will try this place again as I like to give places a 2nd chance."}
{"text":"I met the girls here for lunch.The atmosphere is lovely and the waiter was great but we were disappointed on the food. The hummus was good but the pita bread wasn't soft.  Two of us had the Falafel salad which was mostly chopped parsley.  We spent most our time picking the parsley from our teeth. The salmon salad was good and had a large piece of salmon. For my money, and the best Hummus and Persian food, I would go to the Persian Room for lunch. 

My husband and I are going to try Naya again but this time for dinner."}
{"text":"Exceptional food. Great bar and dining room. Do yourself a favor and ask your server for THE CHEF's TASTING EXPERIENCE. It will not be offered to you but ASK and just relax and enjoy!! Absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"This place was great, well priced, with excellent food. We started with the hummus and baba ganoush appetizer, which was fantastic. We ran out of pita but the delightful guy behind the bar was more than happy to bring us more. We then had the chicken and beef kabobs and they were fantastic. The chicken was a little spicy but not overly so. The meat portions were generous but there was a nice mix of well sized vegetables. Rice accompanied and was somewhat flavorless but nearly unnecessary. The place was dead when we arrived, which was a bit of a shame because the food was very good. We would recommend."}
{"text":"The food is delicious!!!  I am craving it right now!  It definitely makes you want to come back again and again.  I have been back again and again and it is consistent.  It is not a typical middle eastern restaurant.  With lovely soothing ambiance, friendly service, and extremely fresh flavorful food, I give this restaurant 5 stars."}
{"text":"Very authentic Mediterranean cuisine. We got the meat platter which was delicious and we split it.  With the groupon, it was a great deal of $22 for $40 worth of food. Very authentic Middle Eastern spices and the restaurant had a really neat decor. The manager was the nicest! My mom was cold and he brought her his mother's shawl to keep her warm. We chatted with the manager after he introduced himself  and he is doing a great job! Very nice individual!  I loved the feeling that I was going to neighborhood restaurant and getting to know the manager."}
{"text":"I had dinner at Naya recently and took advantage of the groupon offer they have right now. Service was decent although lost points for not including any pitas when packing our baba ghanoush despite saying he was going to include fresh pitas (we would have been fine even if he simply packed the leftover pitas).  Food is expensive for what you get but with the groupon the value isn't bad.  I would recommend trying the kebab, it was well spiced.  Worth a try with a groupon."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try Naya this evening, even though we were headed to Pomo for pizza. The food was incredibly fresh, perfectly seasoned and absolutely delicious. We had the spinach pie, made with their homemade dough, Fatoush salad and the Kafta Kabob. Even the vegetables served with the Kafta were cooked to perfection and as fresh as could be. I rarely eat those medleys but this one was incredibly flavorful. You can tell everything is cooked to order and that the ingredients used are superb.

Our server, Amanda, was extremely knowledgable about the regional cuisine and very attentive. We will absolutely be coming back and will try happy hour one of these days.

The interior was absolutely stunning and I would love to enjoy a meal inside but the temperature was freezing. If it wasn't so cold, we would have gladly sat at one of the luxurious booths. Instead we decided to sit outside since it was a gorgeous evening and perfect temperature."}
{"text":"Not impressed.  Greek Pita has better food with much better prices. Ambiance is nice but food is meh.  We ordered the kefta and chicken kabob plate. Both plates came luke warm so we asked them to warm our food which they did. The sauce was just ok. Overall. .we won't be coming back."}
{"text":"The Shops at Gainey is loaded with new restaurants. This area of Scottsdale has discriminating customers to be sure.
Met a Ph.d friend of ours  for lunch and had a nice table at the big picture window. Will want to return again as we were fully ensconsed in chat most of the time.
This place does have potential as the decor and menu are very nice and the prices fair.
We had issues with the waiter who had a little attitude and did not fully grasp the idea of an experiential customer experience.
This is ok as we did not arrive to be pampered either.  In the end though, he got \"creative\" with our check.
Once we noticed this we asked to see Mike Hamati the Manager on duty.
He was none too thrilled and did the right thing for us.

For this reason we will return as the Mediterranean plate among other items is well prepared.

Just have you \"readers' on when you review your check.."}
{"text":"Waiter very attentive and staff friendly.  Food was delicious.  Portions and price were fine.  Wonderful decor and very nice sitting outside.  Everybody around us was raving, too.  We will return and recommend to our friends."}
{"text":"Tried for lunch and the food was excellent, particularly the Baba Ghanouj and Fried Kebbe.  As others have noted, the interior is luxurious and beautiful.

Why only 3 stars?  Two reasons:

The lunch menu was simply a selection of items that could be 'more-lunch-like' pulled from the regular menu.  Perhaps only one or two additions and no changes in price.  Now, our server did list off four or five 'lunch specials' that were variations on pita wraps but without a price.  However up-charges for $3 were explained (for what I forget)... but an up-charge on what amount?  I should have listened closer to the specials, but a paper lunch special menu would be appreciated.  Especially since the lunch menu as presented was a virtual copy of the regular menu (we were handed both).

Second issue was our server.  When we arrived I saw an employee hunched down outside smoking (I don't care if you spoke or not, but common sense says don't do it where a customer can see you).  Alas, Smokey came in to seat us and take our orders.  Smelling like smoke which was a sure disconnect between the fine interior and ambiance.  We were also greeted by Smokey with an odd \"Are you here to met someone?\".  Perhaps it is a popular meeting spot for lunch?  Anyway...As we pulled away, you guessed it, Smokey was back in his spot working on another cigarette.  

Now, the owner / manager did stop by our table and he was genuinely friendly and welcoming.  We overheard a second server who seemed to really be doing a great job as well.  I could see the kitchen and the men and women back on the line looked efficient and professional.

Yes, we will be back.  The food is worth it and I hope the experience warrants a revised review and another star or hopefully two."}
{"text":"I seriously wanted to love this place,  I begged my husband to eat here rather than the Italian place next door.  Sadly,  we were both very disappointed.   The restaurant is gorgeous and the service was nice,  but the food less than mediocre.  We ordered from the restaurant week menu.  Every dish we had was really bland,  it was as if they ran out of seasonings/spices in the kitchen.  Half the plate was filled with very plain unseasoned white rice,  then a very small portion of extremely over steamed unseasoned vegetables next to the protein which was also sadly unseasoned and unappetizing.   I feel like restaurant week is an awesome opportunity for restaurants to make a great impression,  so that patrons will return and happily pay full price.  This is definitely Not what happened at Naya and with so many other great options available here in Scottsdale,  I highly doubt we will return."}
{"text":"I gotta say, Tony did good. This place is fresh and delicious. The flavors scream authentic Mediterranean with some varieties of Tony's oldies, but goodies.  The atmosphere is classy, the staff is charming, and the food rocks."}
{"text":"First time we have been here.  It was everything we could have hoped for. We started with appetizers. Hummus was good. Mussels were different than we usually see and very good. Tabbouleh was the best I can recall...ever. My entree was a kafta kebab with beef and I enjoyed its flavor. Lots of pepper if that bothers the reader. My wife had kebbeh and enjoyed it a lot. We had bismati rice as a starch and julianned carrots and zucchini as vegetable.  The only problem in the entire meal is the vegetables were barely warm with everything else hot.  No room for dessert. My wife enjoyed the white sangria: sweet with interesting flavors. I enjoyed a Greek white wine and a lebanese red. This has a number of middle eastern dishes which will bring us back. Service was friendly.  Our waitress was nice and knowledgeable but apparently had tables in bar as well as restaurant so wasn't able to be there for food and wine delivery sometimes."}
{"text":"Tonight was the 3rd night Naya has been open.

1.  Service was excellent. Amanda did a super job.
2.  Menu contained many compelling entrees:
     A.  Wife had lamb chops.  Loved them
     B.  I had Jenne's Penne.  OMG.  THE BEST!
3.  Portions very generous.
4.  Priced more than right.
5.  Drinks were right as too volume.
 
My wife and I eat out very often. We think we have a feel for what a nice meal should cost.

After our meal, we both thought of what would be a good value would be for our 
4 drinks...2 appetizers...2 entrees...one desert...one soft drink.  We agreed that $135.00 is about what the meal should have cost....not counting tip.

The bill arrived and it was $98.00 (not counting tip) and we were very pleasantly surprised.

Will we go back?  Not until next week.

Naya will be a success. 

Larry

PS  Our server apologized for taking a few minutes too long to get our drinks.  She told us upfront that this was the crew's third night of being open...and things might take a bit longer.  

She told us this BEFORE the fact and before we got antsy.  Her telling us upfront saved us the aggravation of wondering \"WTF.\""}
{"text":"Three women having a fun night out! We ate \"girly food\", (meaning nothing but appetizers)! Each appetizer was absolutely delicious and unique. Also had a nice bottle of wine. Great service, great appetizers and next time I will try a meal! The décor is beautiful!!!"}
{"text":"I will never eat here again. I went in with a date and the place was empty. After double checking that we weren't walking in at close (which they weren't for another hour), we were sat in a booth right next to a server station. Our waitress was awful. We felt rushed eating our food, especially after she brought a dessert tray out while we weren't even half way done with our dinner. The food wasn't that great and was very over priced. Mediterranean food is my favorite type of food and this just wasn't it. There's better options out there for taste and price."}
{"text":"Worst food ever. Had Shrimp Scampi which was $22 and it tasted really bad. Horrible service. It took the waiter 20 minutes to get a drink. Will never go back here ever. Very expensive food. For a party of 4, they added gratuity of 20%."}
{"text":"Wow this place is so so good and the ambience is just beautiful.  I tried the mixed grill and I was so glad I did.  The lamb chop was perfect. The chicken moist and juicy.  The steak was perfection.  Our waiter gave the best service ever.  We were there for a bachelorette party so we were having a lot of fun talking to him and he was a good sport about it too!  The owner came by and brought us some baklava on the house which was super sweet of them!  Highly recommend this delicious place."}
{"text":"I would highly recommend Naya. for a fabulous new ethnic eating experience in a lovely atmosphere.  Naya's cuisine is based on Lebanese food, which I had a craving for since I had worked in Dearborn for 20 years where the best Middle Eastern food in the United States is served. The food I had was fantastic, the best Lebanese food I've had since I left Dearborn.  We had, and I recommend, Mezza combo plate which is kind of a greatest hits of appetizers for Lebanese food: hummus, baba ghanouj, grape leaves, tabouliand some others.  We also tried the grilled chicken on skewers which was absolutely delicious - - tender flavorful and with a nice charcoal taste.  We finished with a perfect baklava, much more well-balanced than your typical overly sweet Greek dessert.

Naya takes Lebanese food to a new level by offering some other Mediterranean dishes and serving it in an absolutely beautiful high-end decor. The restaurant would be great for dates, adult outings or even family meals for those who like Middle Eastern food. Naya is a real find in Scottsdale"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! The food has exceptional flavor and is very authentic. The Chef's Choice (which is not offered on the menu) is worth asking for. You will be served  nothing but the best & guaranteed satisfaction! By far the BEST Mediterranean cuisine ever!!"}
{"text":"Yup-5 stars. By far- the best Middle Eastern restaurant I have ever eaten in. The Hummus was insane. Pita bread free flowing without even asking for it. Baba gannoush was absolutely the best I have ever eaten. Don't get me started at how absolutely perfect the spinach pie appetizer was. Salad was well dressed with exceptionally fresh greens and tomatoes. I had the baked eggplant dish that was just - perfect. But the one thing that kicked this culinary experience off was the Baklava Martini which was like drinking liquid Baklava.  So- the food was awesome. What was even better was the host and the waiter. Dear lord- nice- patient - and happy. Oh and they packed all our leftovers up - gave us plates and forks to have in case we needed them- again- without asking. By far- my favorite eating out experience to date- with prices being super moderate. Wow.  Woooooow!"}
{"text":"A lot of people will probably try it because it's new and there aren't any up-market med places in the area, but I don't see this place lasting. It's expensive for what you get and the food is unremarkable. Hummus was fine. Chicken kebab plate was ok, spinach pie appetizer not good and the worst part is that the pita was hard and seemingly stale. You couldn't even open it, immediately upon delivery to the table. So the fact that the pita portion was very skimpy didn't bother us because we didn't want it anyway. Not sure if they changed anything about the decor since it was Bloom or Cask or whatever last. The wait staff was nice. The wait for the food, however was very long. Even though you can excuse that because the place is new, there was hardly anyone there, so it shouldn't have taken 20+ minutes to get a hummus appetizer.We'll stick with our old stand-by, Pita House, which would be perfect if there was an outdoor are that was hookah smoke free or an indoor area that didn't give you the creeps. Food-wise, it's way better."}
{"text":"I met some girlfriend's for lunch at Naya back in December.  We were the only ones in the restaurant, so I knew that wasn't a good sign.  We each ordered a salmon salad and it was good, not great.  I am not surprised to see that this restaurant didn't make it.  We'll see what comes in next!"}
{"text":"The food was very good, but what made this place stand out was the exceptional service! 

We sat outside and our waiter Damien was extremely attentive and polite. My boyfriend and I were very impressed with his customer service!!! This is what bumped the rating up to 5 stars!!

Tip: fabulous hummus!"}
{"text":"My dad was in town and wanted to take me, my husband, and our two year old out for dinner.  Thank goodness I made reservations because we showed up and it was their grand opening!  I was amazed at how well they handled everything on such a busy night.  Our server went above and beyond to make sure we were happy and everyone loved what they ordered.  My dad got the salmon, and my husband and I shared the lamb.  Delish!  We will be back."}
{"text":"First time here , I was advised by a friend, I like Mediterranean cuisine Italian to lebanese , The outside is well lite and you can see the name of the restaurant from far, I got a warm welcome and sat down by the bar where Joel and Anthony greeted me and introduced themself , asa first timer I ask for the food menu and Anthony sugested a few things also let met taste some wine a very unique Blend of shiraz, sauvignon frank and cavernet sauvignon medium body slightly sweet and hint of spices,  after that I tried the Hummus which was very nicely done a creamy puree of the garbanzo and lemon juice fresh
After that I tried the Kebbeh Senieh a Ground beef mixed cracked wheat spices onions pine nuts baked and served with a cucumber yogurt ,and side of steamed vegetables Anthony suggested a side of spicy chilli. sauce which gave it a whole new taste , a fresh soft to the palate but with a hit of spice from. the chilli, over all a great experience at Naya , I will be back for more for sure."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with friends. First impression: it is beautiful inside and makes me want to ask them to decorate my house! The service was quick and friendly and the server was happy to recommend a dish when I was humming and haaing. Mind you, it was pretty dead, I think there were about 3 tables with people at them.

We had hummus and baba ghanoush to start. They did not bring enough pitas at first, but brought a refill when we asked. Both dips were good and the pita bread was hot.

Then we shared the special Greek salad. The chicken had a great rub on it! I'm glad we shared though because it was HUGE.

I had Jenny's penne for my entree which is a spicy penne with chicken. It was very good. My friends had the chicken masala and the beef kabab which they both thoroughly enjoyed. 

We also were lucky enough to try some of the mixed drinks. My favourite was the mojito relative that they do."}
{"text":"Really Good Service and the Live Music was a great touch, but the food fell a bit short in my opinion. It was good... not great.

Their humus is very good... creamy and flavorful... and it's a pretty big portion for an appetizer. This is a great item to share for Happy Hour with friends over some wine after work.

Other than the humus, we also shared the Fried Kebbeh to start. I'd never had these before... they reminded me of Falafel, but a meat version.  It was a little dry, but we had the humus to dip it in so that worked out well.

For dinner, the hubby had the Chicken Kebabs... his chicken was dry with a few burnt spots, and the rice and veggies were just 'ok'.  I had the Lebanese Moussaka ... eggplant baked with garbanzo beans, onions, and tomatoes.. this was very tasty and savory.  A really good vegetarian dish.  But again the side of rice was just 'ok'.

The manager (owner?) came over to ask if the music was too loud.  That gets Extra Points in my book for service!"}
{"text":"Ok definitely the worst restaurant I have been to in Scottsdale!!!  The service is slow!!!! They messed up every single item we ordered. The restaurant had a terrible draft and the food was mediocre. 
I would never ever go here again!  Many better options for Mediterranean food in Scottsdale. A definite add to the must miss list. Blech."}
{"text":"Fabulous food!  Beautiful restaurant inside with outside patio seating as well.

You have to order the chicken shish kabobs!  Better than homemade.  Delicious chicken (nice portions) fresh onions/bell peppers.  It comes with rice and sautéed vegetables.  All are cooked to perfection.  This entrée is served with an amazing garlic/olive oil dipping sauce that is out of this world!  

We have also tried many things on the menu.  Everything has been flavorful and cooked perfectly.

Highest recommendation!  Great, pleasant service too ~"}
{"text":"This place is a gem, the food is excellent (lamb chops) and the drinks are amazing....Joel the mixologist is a true MIXOLOGIST."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been to Naya four times and it is truly now one of our favorite restaurants in Scottsdale/Phoenix. The ambiance is very nice and the food is simply wonderful. The Salmon, Shish Tawouk (chicken kababs) and Grape Leaves (with meat) are exceptional. The tabbouleh salad is the best we have ever had.  The Kebbeh Senieh is very good. We had baklava for dessert one evening; it was excellent. The only dish we have had that was a bit disappointing was the lamb chops; they were thin and fatty. The server apologized for the problem and took care of the issue which is all anyone can ask for when something is not quite right.  The rice that is served with the meals is one of the best we have had; absolutly delicious. The service at Naya is excellent; everyone is friendly and attentive.  Naya is a restaurant that we will be frequenting regularly."}
{"text":"Great experience from start to finish! The service was spot on and we completely enjoyed our menu choices. My favorite was the Shish Tawook. The staff really worked as a team, everyone at some point stopped by our table to remove a dish or see if we needed anything."}
{"text":"Ordered chicken dishes both plates had undercooked chicken, manager changed it but not to fond of havin undercooked poultry, menu is pretty small not much of variety"}
{"text":"My family wanted to try this place so I went along even though I really wanted Italian food. We walked in and I was instantly pleased-dim, romantic lighting accompanied with a beautiful bar, outside patio, and really comfy booths. I even noticed a private dining room in the corner for events. 

To make a long story short, I got my Italian fix-I ordered Jene's penne and it was so delicious! It was covered in a white Bianca sauce which had a bacon aftertaste, so yummy. I tasted my family's plates which were more geared towards the Lebanese culture-kifta kabob, chicken skewers, tikka, tabbouleh, hummus, and fettush. All were fabulous!

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who asked about Lebanese food. If you have the pleasure to meet the owner because he is very sweet and hospitable (I forgot to catch his name!"}
{"text":"Absolutely beautiful atmosphere. Everything is silver and gold and subtle with beautiful chandeliers everywhere. But not glitzy, the designer has a great eye, that's for sure. This is a great date spot. The booths are large and the tables aren't too close to one another. The bar is a good size and separated from the dining room. 

The food was delicious. We came in for their restaurant week menu and it was lovely. What I don't really understand is the direction of the menu. It's part Mediterranean, part Italian. But which is it? I had a house salad, a salmon with rice and vegetables and while everything was cooked perfectly, it was neither Italian *or* Mediterranean! Oh well. 

I would come back, but I'm not running."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a Chicago suburban banquet hall turned restaurant... This is your place! When you walk into a restaurant and the staff out numbers the patrons 2:1 you know there's a problem! They have a nice outdoor setup but if you don't go to dinner there quick, you may not get a chance to. I'm surprised they haven't closed their doors already and give this place only a few more months on life support. The food is moderately priced given the area but it's nothing to write home about. Their hummus is homemade and something you come to expect from traditional Mediterranean establishments. We ordered scallops which at some point may've tasted good. They were sautéed and seasoned on the outside but cold on the inside. I didn't think restaurants microwaved scallops... Maybe they do? The service was so-so and the only other table in the restaurant that was occupied was next to us and had their own waiter who neglected to serve them for over 15 minutes. All in all, this isn't what I would expect for the price, service or quality of food."}
{"text":"The food here was amazing.  I especially liked the keybeh neyah.  I definitely recommend this place for great food."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Very good food, very good service, very good hummus, very cool decor! I'd come back in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"Really good Middle Eastern fare in more of a white tablecloth environment. 

Service was excellent -- charming and attentive hostess and server. It's a beautiful room/space, set up for \"energy\" (i.e. open and noisy -- with techno-ey music playing) rather than intimacy. Menu is interesting mix of middle eastern and Italian (clams and mussel dishes next to the babagnoush and kebabs). We started with an order of the falafel, which was really terrific. Comes with tahini but no pita (server: \"don't worry, I'll bring some out for you\"). Entrees are large portions. My kibbeh was really good; meaty, crunchy and loaded with spices. Wifey loved her moussaka. Beautiful bar. Nice that they had some craft-y beers (Four Peaks Kiltlifter, Anchor Steam) to go with the traditional nasty Bud/Miller/Coors.

Good stuff."}
{"text":"I love Mediterranean food, so when I was at an art event on Sunday and saw that they had $7.99 lunch specials I had to jump on it. I decided to take out my food as I was helping with the event. I walked in and was not expecting the beautiful décor. The bar area and tables are beautifully decorated with blue, silver, and a touch of gold. I had to wait a little while for someone to come up as to what I could see there was only a manager and a hostess working. The manager was extremely nice and apologetic for the wait and quickly handed me a menu. I could not decide between the chicken shwarma and the Mediterranean sliders; but the manager recommended the sliders, which comes with a salad and pita bread. I asked the manager if I could add some hummus for the pita bread and he told me they would. I waited for about 15 minutes for my food and when I received my bill I was surprised--it suddenly went from around the $7.99+tax to $17.99. I asked the waitress how much the hummus was and she told me that you get a good amount for the price. I signed my check, but I was not happy. The manager brought out my food and apologized profusely for the mistake and put a free dessert and extra hummus and salad for the trouble. I told him thank you and that I would be back as the waitress and himself were very nice.

Once I sat down at ate my food--omg, it was so good! The hummus had a nice layer of sweet olive oil and the pita bread was warm and soft. There were two sliders and they were extremely juicy and flavorful. I am unsure of what kinds of buns they use, but they soaked up the juice from the meat and were not soggy at all. The salad came with tomato, lemon, cucumbers, and an olive oil dressing, which complimented all of the flavors well.

Overall this was a great restaurant to try, but next time I will ask for the costs of extras, such as the hummus up front. But, the customer service was a 10+ as the staff were extremely kind, apologetic, and had great suggestions. I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"My sister and I were in town last week to see family, and being new to the area, stumbled upon Naya and, boy, was I glad.

I had a delicious salad with tea smoked chicken (never had before) and a light, delicious salad dressing.  It was so good, I was sorry not to have more time to stop there again.  Do yourself a big favor and enjoy a meal there soon."}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean restaurant in AZ! Everything tasted so authentic and the menu had a nice variety from mostly Lebanese to some Italian dishes. The steak hummus is a must and the sujuk  and makanek are unbelievable. Don't miss out on one of the best dinning experience ever."}
{"text":"I stopped in here for lunch in-between meetings and it was fantastic!

The Service: The manager and waiter were very attentive! My water was never empty and they always made sure I was okay. They even brought me hummus and baklava to go with my meal. They were incredibly friendly and sweet.

The Food: I ordered the salmon salad. I asked them if they could blacken it, and they did! They even created a new spice mix for me--it was amazing! The hummus was creamy and made from scratch. Their baklava was sweet, but not overpowering. Everything was amazing. They have a large selection of wine that I wish I could've indulged in, but I was on the clock so I'll just have to go back.

The Atmosphere: This place is pretty fancy. Its very modern and clean. Beautiful interior decorating. Let's just say I was happy wearing work clothes.

Overall, I had a lovely experience. I will definitely go back again and bring some people :)"}
{"text":"I took out the fried kibbeh and steak hummus and both were excellent.  My in-laws are Lebanese and Naya's food was just as great.  My wife said the mezza combo was the best she's had from a restaurant.  We'll be back to eat-in real soon."}
{"text":"Checked out Naya Mediterranean Cuisine for lunch recently. We ordered the Mezza Combo which came with Hummus, baba ghanouj, grape leaves and tabboleh salad to start. For my entree I had the Salmon Salad which was served with seasonal baby greens with aged balsamic honey vinaigrette topped with pan seared salmon. The salad was good, but my salmon was super fishy and not what I would expect from a $16.00 salad. 

I would be interested in coming back here and checking out their dinner menu, maybe I came on an off day. Service was fantastic though and the decor was simply stunning!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Great place for drinks or a calm dining experience. Had the falafel. Was a little too crisp, but flavor was excellent. Will try something else the next time I go."}
{"text":"We ate here after walking past and thinking it look interesting.  Our waitress, Amanda, was very attentive and dealt with my food allergies.  The executive chef even came to our table to help me choose an entree.  The food was wonderful and included some of the best veggies I have eaten in a very long time.  We will eat here again any time we are in town.  The best meal we have eaten in a very long time."}
{"text":"Great new place. Enjoyed the atmosphere and the food was incredible an unique. So tired of the same steak and sides. Ugh! 
This place was refreshing and beautiful. Great date place!"}
{"text":"The hummus was very good! I had the chicken kebab for dinner and it was delicious. Very nice staff as well."}
{"text":"Don't let one persons bad experience divert you from trying this place. First the decor is great. Lots of inside seating, full bar and outdoor seating as well. The staff is very friendly! Most importantly the food was delicious!! We came for lunch, had a number of different things to include dessert. Everything was fresh. You owe it to yourself to try this place."}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean meal I've ever had! good entry level restaurant for people who are not used to the Lebanese culture, but still authentic!"}
{"text":"Wow, this was a fantastic dining experience. Not only is the restaurant itself beautiful, but the ambience is excellent and my wife and I were absolutely blown away by the food. We started with the steak hummus which was fantastic - my wife isn't a huge hummus fan, but she loved this...always a good sign. Our best decision of the night, however, was splitting the mixed grill for dinner - chicken, lamb and two kinds of beef served with veggies and Israeli cous cous...each of them was unique, all of them were delicious. This was a perfect way to get a feel for the range of the menu. We are definitely going to be back here sooner than later!"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to a wonderful meal and unfortunately it turned out to be very disappointing. The ambience is beautiful and the service very attentive but the food was mediocre at best. Ordered Filet mignon that came with a vegetable medley and skinny fries. We both sent the veggies and fries back as they were both served to us cold!  The filet was good not great especially for the price and a bit too highly seasoned."}
{"text":"My wife and I recently ate at Naya after friends and family recommended it. Our food and service was amazing. The quality and taste of the food is difficult to find and compete with anywhere, but the atmosphere and nice staff really put it over the top. I had the kafta and my wife went with kibbe and spinach pies. We also had the mezza platter, which was delicious !"}
{"text":"Disappointing menu.  Many Middle Eastern foods missing and replaced with Italian dishes, like a pasta and a caprese salad (yes, really).  Notice the wonderful scallops on the photo of the restaurant?  They were out of them.

Very few selections if you do not eat meat.  Portions were small, the tabooli was OK as was the yogurt (Labni), the kefta was seasoned OK.  The cheese filled phyllo was not phyllo but some brick like dough ball. They were just awful. The bread was just so so.

Much better places to try are Pars on frank Lloyd Wright or Persina Room.  Much better, cheaper and more food."}
{"text":"Great Location, great atmosphere. But that is where it ends. Twice the price as Eden's Grill.  Small portions. We were excited for the special feature on Saturday evenings menu Paella $49.00 entree was very bland & would have tasted better if it were cooked in Rice-a Roni. Another Scottsdale restaurant that will come & go.
We won't be back"}
{"text":"Great new restaurant in Scottsdale! Service was fantastic and the food was very good. 

For an appetizer, we shared the grape leaves and Falafel. Both were very tasty! I had the pan seared salmon for a main course - I loved it, it was very well prepared and served with carrots and rice. My boyfriend had the grilled chicken - it was good, a little bland but I prefer that to places that cover their food in sauces. 

Always nice to find restaurants that support local growers and use quality ingredients. 

Very cute atmosphere, reasonable prices, and a great dining experience. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Naya is an attractive-looking restaurant with a modern feel and a great deal of eye appeal.  When you walk in, you can't help but think \"this is going to be a great meal\".  Unfortunately, ours wasn't.

Besides the ambiance, there are some outstandingly strengths at Naya -- the menu is  more imaginative than the usual kabobs and gyros, the rice and vegetable sides dishes were unusually tasty, and our dessert (selected from a tray) was A+.  Somebody knows how to cook.

Unfortunately, that somebody did not cook the proteins on our main courses -- steak and chicken kabobs.  The steak was underdone inside, burnt outside.  The chicken was so overcooked and dry that I literally couldn't eat three of the pieces.  Neither was seasoned so you could tell.  Perhaps the problem is an overly-hot grill, lack of marination, and a salt shaker with clogged holes.  In any case, when you ruin the main course, it kind of messes up the whole meal.

There were two other problems as well -- the restaurant, though laid out with lots of open space, was very noisy.  And the service was spotty -- our order was taken promptly and the appetiser came out in 15 minutes (okay since it had to be freshly baked), but then the main courses took 30+ minutes and the dessert, 25.

If we had not had a coupon, the check would have been $70 for one appetiser, two main courses (not the expensive ones), one dessert, and no drinks.  That would have been okay but maybe a bit high even if the meats were properly prepared.  But they weren't, so I left feeling that \"we was robbed\".  Yet I almost want to return - these problems could be fixed and Naya could be a stunner."}
{"text":"Beautiful place... Great ambiance and quality food. Had the mixed kabab and it was awesome. Will be back very soon"}
{"text":"My dad and I eat here literally once a week, at least. Our order is on point and delicious every time! Our favorite appetizer is the Baba Ghanouj and the calamari, although if I had to choose one over the other, the Ghanouj would win every time. For the main event, I would definitely recommend the filet mignon if you're in the mood for something hardy. If not, I would recommend the baked eggplant-it's very flavorful and has a nice kick. Besides the food, the service is always above and beyond standard, most of the servers started addressing me by name by my second visit. However, I don't go out to get treated politely, I go out to eat great food, and that's what Naya delivers! On a side note, if you like sweet wine I would definitely steer you towards the moscatto."}
{"text":"went there for happy hour and and split some appetizers.  Nice selction of things to try and a good wine selection as well.  A nice addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Everything was absolutely amazing. To food to the service to the interior design everything was just wow. If you never had mediterranean food and would like to try it out, this place will have you coming back and craving for more. I had such a great time that surely I know you would too."}
{"text":"The food was excellent, service was great! The owner/manager came over and was very friendly checking on us. It was my birthday dinner and I was served baklava soo good!! Then they brought bite size for everyone! Highly recommended would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Very Delicious meal. I had the chicken shish Taouk and it was lovely. It was a large plate with chicken skewers, carrots, greens, and rice. The dessert was great. The atmosphere is romantic and beautiful decor inside and out. The owner Malake  Hakimeh is very attentive and courteous. I will be back many times. The pita is delicious too!!!"}
{"text":"Naya, Naya, Naya... You had me at hummus, but then swept me off my feet with your beyond amazing baba ghanouj! Seriously so good, creamy with the perfect amount of garlic - I have been craving it ever since! 

I came for lunch with the gorgeous Gabi M and we shared the Mezze Combo plater as well as the fatoush salad topped with chicken shwarma. It was the perfect amount of food for a \"ladies lunch\". The mezze combo had stuffed grape leaves, tabbouleh, an assorted of olives as well as really tasty homemade pickled turnips and carrots. Oh, and of course warm pita bread! 

With a beautiful interior that is tastefully decorated and excellent staff, I can see why Naya gets the amazing reviews that are so well deserved."}
{"text":"Was here last year and enjoyed the food. Thought we would try it again and it did not disappoint. Great Mediterranean food, good service and friendly atmosphere. We enjoyed it so much decided to go back again during our stay. Food cooked to perfection and they were very accommodating making sure everything met our satisfaction."}
{"text":"We only ate at the bar for a quick dinner. But the speed, variety on the menu, and quality of food was very well received by a couple of us road warriors.  Next time in that area we would gladly pick this place first."}
{"text":"Time for a major rave. We shared the baba, and it was great. They garnished with pomegranate seeds, which is a terrific addition. The mixed grill was superb. Especially noteworthy was the lamb chop , excellent meat from Colorado and cooked perfectly. Special note: the garlic sauce served with the meat is potent and delishious. The desserts looked yummy. The espresso was quite acceptable. The ambiance is moderately fancy; not a redshirt place. The music is not too loud but somewhat lacking in definition. The staff are hardworking and polite. This place makes it into our must return list."}
{"text":"Excellent wine.  Hummus creamy and rich.  Scallops delicious, cooked just right. Tender, not rubbery. Spinach appetizer a bit doughy.  Muscles sweet and tender and juicy for dipping bread."}
{"text":"Prices might be a little on the high side for the actual food on the menu/plate, but it's fairly decent Arabic food.  Service was good, but I would have preferred a bit more middle eastern flair for the atmosphere.  Had the chicken kabobs and fattoush salad...solid order.  Next time, I am just going to order there entire apps menu as they all sounded great!  Hope this place survives.  If not, find a cheaper location, dial up the middle eastern/Lebanese atmosphere and deliver same quality for half the price."}
{"text":"This is our first time at this restaurant and first time in Scottsdale. Mike and Alex were great at serving our table. I'm very pleased with the food, customer service and ambiance. Would definitely recommend this place to everyone. Everything was so fresh!"}
{"text":"We were easily sat on a Friday Night without a reservation. Fast service. We shared a bottle of wine and each enjoyed our dishes. I had Chicken Kabobs and my boyfriend had the steak. Beautiful decor. Would like to return for lunch and try more menu items."}
