{"text":"I strongly do not recommend this place - all meat dishes here are so fatty - I felt sick just looking at the two meat dishes  I bought once I got home (Caldereta and Beef stek as they call it back home)  and didn't bother to eat and ended up throwing it out - owner/cook didn't use proper beef parts for their \"beef stek\" dish  - and on top of that it was a tough meat! Complete disappointment! I would advise a healthier way of preparing these awesome Filipino dishes- as most of us here are more health conscious now a days but don't necessarily want to isolate our cultural food from our daily food intake."}
{"text":"I definitely do not recommend this place because of the attitude and condescending behaviour of the owner. I once was a regular here, and have visited more than once a month for sure, because it's the closest Filipino takeout place from me.  However, when I complained the food I had purchased was raw and I had to throw it out, he told me to prove it, drive back home and get it, hereby indirectly calling me a liar.  I threw it out by reflex but then kept the other items, which were ukoys because I had to go back; they can't take my money and give me nothing for it, I expected a replacement or a discount.  I did have the Ukoy with me, as evidence, but the other was already sitting in the trash.  When I showed the raw Ukoy he took it shoved it in my face and said it's cooked, when the middle was just wet flour still.  How rude! All this done with angered movements, raised voice and condescending glares.  It was not cooked, at least not for me.  What's wrong with him? Why can't he just remedy the situation either by cooking it more or replacing it with a cooked one?  That's just ridiculous considering I used to come by all the time. I haven't gone to this place in at least years.  This place was the first I banned and ex-communicated, there are two places I would never go back to and this is one of them.  They are cheap with portions, the owners have something up their you know what, they cannot take a complaint nevertheless remedy a complaint. Horrible. Negative rating would have been warranted.  I would not give these people your hard earned pennies, it would be a waste. Go ahead and  google their reviews, I just saw one on urbanspoon which reminded me of my experience with these people, and that is now why I decided to share it with you all. So be forewarned.  One complaint after continued patronage over the years and this is what I get in terms of customer service."}
{"text":"I'd give this place 0, but Yelp is kind enough to ensure the lowest rank is 1*. What a shame... All I can say is, that this is the ABSOLUTE WORST.... I repeat ABSOLUTE WORST Filipino restaurant in the GTA. None of the other ratings and comments in here are exaggerations.   This establishment makes a complete mockery of the dishes they are trying to present. I pass by this place every time I go for work, and I decided to stop by to check things out (I hadn't checked the reviews prior to going). Food uses the lowest grade cuts (literally scraps). There is no attention or continuity between the owners and workers. Overall, this restaurant is sloppy.  I feel extremely embarrassed and sorry for the people who have to run this place. It doesn't seem that they understand what quality food or service is.  Absolute garbage. I wish them luck, and hope they change."}
{"text":"I completely agree with the previous review made by Val Y. I've been here twice, which were both not a pleasant experience.   The first time I tried this place was last December. They seemed quite unorganized and there were a couple of people handling the food, and all of them did not know the prices. We had some leftover food (still a full container) that we wanted to take home, and the lady there took our food and said she'd pack it, but ended up throwing it away. When we asked for it, she said \"oh sorry, i didn't know\". In other restaurants, if they made a mistake like that, they would be courteous and offer something in return.. but they didn't.  After that incident, my family decided to give this place another try, 6 months later. They still seemed unorganized with their prices. A lady was taking our orders, along with the owner in the background. First, we ordered a large \"bopis\", and asked how much it cost, the lady said $8.00, so we said okay. We also ordered a bunch of other things, along with the bopis.. but when we reached the cashier, the owner took over to punch in the prices. He punched in $10 for the bopis, and when we told him that the lady told us it was $8, he rudely replied with no, it's $10... we paid for our items, but we were still really confused so when the lady was packing our food, we asked her again how much the large bopis cost, she said yeah it's actually $8, but kind of pointed that the owner was around so, she can't really do anything. I am 100% sure that the owner overcharged us on all the items.   I really do not recommend going to this place because of their really dishonest service; they will definitely rip you off in any way they can! (not to mention that their food is also subpar from the other places around Mississauga like Quiapo Quiapo).  Never going back here again!"}
{"text":"DON'T EAT HERE!  FOOD POISONING TWICE!! I am a long-time customer of Inihaw Grill (3 yrs in Mississauga).  The food has never been great.  Just ok due to cheap, fatty cuts of meat, not very flavourful but the price is reasonable enough & it's convenient when you don't have time to cook Filipino food.  My kids & husband do not like Filipino food so I came here occasionally to get my \"fix\".  Two years ago I ordered a catering tray of pansit noodles for a family function.  No one could eat it.  It smelled & tasted (that first fateful bite) as tho' it had been oversprayed with Mr. Clean!  I told the owner about it the following week.  He apologized & just shrugged it off.  No refund offered, nor did I ask for one.  I gave them the benefit of the doubt.  Perhaps a one-time mistake.  But periodically after eating my usual combo:  kare - kare stew (beef, beef  tripe, eggplant, green beans & peanut  butter), dinuguan (pork in pig's blood) & pansit noodles, my stomache would feel a bit unsettled.  I thought it was due to the fat content in the food.  But on Weds. Jan. 14/15 at 2:30pm I picked up the same combo.  That night I started vomiting & had endless diarrhea for 24 hours!  I didn't bother calling the restaurant.  I contacted Peel Public Health.  5 days later my stomache is still unsettled.  What was in that?  Bacteria?  Cleaning solution?  Not sure.  I froze the combo leftovers I had for testing.  Be warned!!  Eat here at your own medical health's risk!"}
{"text":"Well, this review is only based on the one thing I ordered - BBQ skewers (pork & chicken)  Tasted good, but the chicken was burnt. Total price for the skewers is $3.40 incl. tax  HOWEVER, it is kinda fishy that they dont post prices of the meals anywhere. Even in the take out menu, no prices were indicated for individual orders. ONLY FOR PARTY TRAYS ARE WRITTEN. But other than that, PRICES ARE NOWHERE TO BE FOUND. I guess they decide on the cashier ... what a scam."}
