{"text":"Went to Stonehill New Year's Eve for dinner. Food was excellent. I personally had the phyllo wrapped mushroom and the New York striploin, both of which I would have again. My one complaint about the food is that the serving given as an appetizer was a little too big.

The service was generally good although it was easy to tell it is a new restaurant and things weren't always flowing as smoothly as possible. Despite that, the staff seemed genuinely friendly and interested in providing the best service they could."}
{"text":"I've really tried to give Stonehill a chance. Four too many times that is.

Upon my initial visit to Stonehill, I thought the interior was great. An upscale dining venue in NW Calgary is exactly what was needed in our neighbourhood. I quickly found out why the place wasn't very busy. First off, you'd think with TV's at every table and a large main screen that the restaurant would turn on the volume for a hockey game. No. Instead, they're a bit confused at what this place is trying to be. Upscale dining? Upscale sport venue? The only place you can watch the game is near the bar, and there's not much room there. You can hear other tables asking their waiters to change the channel in the main dining area to the Flames game. I guess they can watch without sound.

In addition to this, I was looking forward to having a gluten-free option from their menu. I ordered the gluten-free flatbread, and then the manager came to our table and told us that they're out of them, but \"I can go across the street to buy them\". Pardon? I'm not asking where to buy gluten-free foods. I'm well aware of the wonderful store across the street.

My fourth and last visit to Stonehill was the most disappointing. I ordered a shrimp salad from the minimal menu. Out came an oily pile of lettuce and 5 shrimp. The menu indicated the salad would have a bunch of fresh veggies such as snap peas etc. I didn't see any (unless they put them through a food processor?). Just lettuce and shrimp. The salad dressing had ABSOLUTELY no flavour. It was as if the \"chef\" didn't mix the dressing, and just poured the oil layer on the salad.

I let the manager know just so they can improve their food quality for other guests. She said she would check with the chef. She didn't return to my table to provide me with any insight into my lackluster meal, nor do anything with our bill.

Goodbye Stonehill....don't waste your money!"}
{"text":"Here for lunch. Lisa had the mushroom flat bread, very rustic and cooked to perfection. I had the burger with onion rings and a side salad. The burger was cooked medium and was moist and tasty, with a perfect bun, the salad was light and crispy with tasty house dressing. The downfall was the the rings, they were very greasy. When we brought it up with our server she was very apologetic and discounted our bill. All in all, it was a pleasant experience and we would return!"}
{"text":"To me, the term \"tavern\" conjures up images of a seedy bar in a rundown hotel. The word seedy does not even enter my mind when I think of Stonehill. This massive, two-story building houses what can only be described as a casually elegant restaurant and lounge. The centrepiece of the entire structure being the two-story wine tower with its own elevator visible from every table in the place. The tables are plentiful and very well-spaced making conversation easy and pleasant. The dining room is on the lower level, with booths along the outer walls, each with its own window. The upper level is the tavern (a misnomer, in my opinion) with a number of flat screens and different seating options. When weather permits, there is a huge balcony off the upper level as well.

The service was friendly and attentive without being intrusive. The food was very good and ranged from salads, flatbreads, pasta and sandwiches to more elaborate entr√©es like braised lamb shank. We were there for the more casual fare, and found it to be tasty and plentiful. I really liked the Stonehill Crispy Potatoes, a fancier version of potato skins with pulled pork instead of bacon.

In an area of the city that has long been a restaurant wasteland, this is a welcome addition. Here's hoping that it will continue along the path it has started."}
{"text":"For such a classy place it's very very awful service is slow , drinks over priced for a harvest hills area and food , well anything you could get at Boston pizza for double ... Not a fan when your the only table in the place"}
{"text":"\"You may as well eat it ... \"

Four of us went there a few weeks ago. Arrived at 830. Waitress was nice, but the food takes a long time to arrive. 45mins for appetizers and another 30mins for mains. My friend had a salmon dish, when he ordered his dish, he specifically ask them not to over cook it. When the dish arrived, of course its over cooked. So he asked the waitress to bring it back to the kitchen. The waitress came back and said the most amazing thing. She said,  \"You may as well eat it, coz its going to take another 30min for the kitchen to redo this.\" I think this is ridiculous as if we got our food at their mercy, so we \"may as well eat it\" and stop demanding this and that. We asked to talk to the manager, tell her what happened. She apologized and offer us free desert and stuff. However, it becomes quite pointless. We were there hoping for a good time and good food, not free stuff. 
I actually like my lamb dish. I may go back to give it another chance, may be half a year later."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner June 16, 2011. I don't typically complain but it took an hour to get appetizers. The place wasn't even busy. The server was completely clueless.  I don't know if she was just bad or management really need train better. The restaurant wasn't remotely busy.  This establishment really need to step it up in terms of service.  The food was actually pretty good. I recommend the mussels. It was delicious."}
{"text":"I am giving it THREE stars FOR NOW.....

My girls and I went to Stonehill for the first time a few weeks ago (just before xmas).  Thought we would give it a try since it's a new restaurant and it's around my hood.  

We were very disappointed when we saw the menu....NO WINGS!!!  Seriously?  We love wings and we were craving for wings.  That was sad.  We wanted to leave....but we stayed because we wanted to give this nice restaurant another chance.  

We ordered an appetizer - Stonehill Dip to try instead.  It was ok, I thought it was a little dry.....but overall, this is not a bad appetizer to munch on. And I ordered this drink - Lyncburge Lemonade to try.....I love my JD!!  Even though we didn't have wings, we still had a great time.  I enjoy the nice, fancy atmosphere in the restaurant.  

Service: Good
Food: NO WINGS!  Boo!
Atmosphere: Good

Yes, I will go back to Stonehill again.  I am hoping, crossing my fingers, praying, begging, that they will add one of the most important food group - WINGS on the menu.  Because this is one of the restaurants that I do enjoy sitting there, having my girlie drinks and have a great time with my girls."}
{"text":"Always slow service.food is good, portion sizes are alright.the upstairs patio is great.a huge building that would be nice to bring a large group to except that invariably someone's meal will be burnt, or cooked wrong, or skipped entirely. Do not go here if you have an appointment to attend anytime afterwards. Same problems as under the previous name of Flight Deck. The waitresses are good at what they do but the kitchen is horribly inept."}
{"text":"As another yelper had mentioned, causal elegant atmosphere.  Ate in the lower dining room where there's a separate menu from the upper tavern.  Being owned by the Vintage group, there were high expectations with this new restaurant focusing on providing great food on a  affordable budget compared to their other offerings.  I was pleasantly surprised by the wealth of wine, beer, drink choices.   Our server was attentive and the water glass was never empty.  The onion soup which was maybe a 8 out of 10,  was hot and the onions were well softened and caramelized.  The Toast and cheese on top was great.  Nothing too exciting but I know Ill have it again.  The main course was the spicy prawn linguine.  The prawns were very tasty and they were actually prawns! Not popcorn shrimp or shrimp. The basil infused shell on tail prawns were done to perfection and again I was pleasantly surprised.  I was expecting something more bland...lol.  I actually savoured the prawn,  it was so yummy.  The linguine was done al-dente and splendid.  The baguette garlic toast that accompanied the meal was done well too.  Not a wet drippy slab of melted garlic butter on toast. The worst part was that I had passed on dessert...I was too full! For sure Ill visit here again as an alternative to the other typical restaurant in this class (think Earls, Joeys, Milestones)"}
{"text":"Yes... a 2 star for such a nice place... it cannot be helped in our case! In short, the service wrecked the experience for us.
We had been asked to give one of the \"Redwater\" chains another go by management at Redwater for a terribly grey, no-char at all steak we received at our table one night awhile back. We agreed to return weeks later and decided on a location somewhat close to home - the Stonehill. Actually a friend had said something nice about this place, that we had to try it esp. because we lived out this way now. OK, so we figured if we came here and loved it, it was be easy-peasy to come back maybe even once a week and adopt as a fave!
Halt!
We arrived and the outer building first impression IS nice. We were greeted inside with a sign and no hostess stating that the bottom section is closed and to find our way up to the Tavern and seat ourselves. OK, fine. But please, someone sweep the stairs! Found our way to the top, grabbed our own menus and found a booth. The inside of the place is quite lovely, I adore the wine vault that comes up the 2 storeys in the openness and the fireplace. The wood contrasts the stone stylishly. However, I did not think each and every booth needed 2 TVs in such a nice place but.... again the real killer of the meal was the service. A gal who was not lovin' her job, did not want to be there, was curt and did not want to talk about the menu at all even though it was our first visit!
M was happy that Steamwhistle was on sale, he had that and I observed the martini menu! Over the course of dinner, I had 2 martinis that were just ok.
For an appy, we let the waitress pick us a half pound of wings that were on special for $3.99. Not bad - we were given sesame ginger ones, not bad at all and we did enjoy the dill ranch dipping sauce. The chicken wing portions themselves were nothing crazy special and even though some were tiny-tiny, we would get them again on special.
Next up - 2 steaks. I like mine rare, hubby med-rare. Both came out rare (no biggy). When asked by a passing by manager how out first bites were, I hated to tell her that my mashed potatoes were stone cold. I had to try and eat around them and by the time the side order of spuds arrived, I was all but done my meal. Never saw her again. (no free drink, ice cream...)  I did love the beets that I chose as one of my sides (LOVE beets and never like prepping them at home due to the mess!) and the steak was some better than the one M ordered at Redwater some time ago. At least it had sear marks! My only complaint was that my steak was very sinewy and it was hard to cut through all that.
Checked out the dessert menu and decided just to call it a night. We had had a wonderful evening together - just when our server was NOT around. She was a black cloud with her overall attitude. She then brought us the bill and it was the one for the drunken slobs outside on the patio - no, no thanks, not paying their Mega booze bill, we are done.
Out to the car we went that apparently was near the drunken tables self appointed smoking area so our new car reeked to high heaven of cigarette smoke.
Home please - we would not come back unless someone else suggested it."}
{"text":"We stopped by here on St. Patrick's day looking for a little bit of a classier establishment to tip green pints and have a meal. In case I'm not articulating well, what that means is that we desperately wanted to avoid drunk 18 year old stick girls vomiting green Keith's all over us. 

Well, we definitely succeeded here!

It's a massive bar with a lot of televisions and a sort of upscale feel to it. I remember coming here when it was called the Flight Deck and thinking about how odd it was that such a nice, modern and HUGE establishment was located in such a weird place.

Maybe that's why I've never seen it full.

No matter. I got some green beers and proceeded to sip away my sorrows (oh, you triflin' women, when you gonna quit your triflin?! Can't you see I'm trying to pay you no mind, triflin' women!? Quit your triflin' ways!). I also ordered some fish and chips. Gotta make sure I'm getting my Omega 3's when I'm gettin' my \"pensive bitter reflection\" on. 

We also ordered a few starters including the calamari. The calamari was very good; lightly breaded and delicious. The fish and chips was also pretty good - I appreciated that my fish weren't soggy like they sometimes get when a place preps them and lets them sit while other meals get put together. Good work, Stonehill.

On the subject of bread, it was awesome that they had some gluten free options for my GF friend who came with. She was really happy with the flatbread she ordered - and it did look good. Even my non-GF friend ordered a gluten free flatbread so they could share. Now that, ladies and gentlemen, is some sort of special friend love right there.

Conversation carried on throughout the night and as I drained a few more green beers into myself I came to the point where seeing leprechauns became less of a joke and more of a reality. When that moment hits, it's time to be on your way.

In the end, I'd go back. I'd probably drink less beer and order something a little more adventurous, but on this day, Stonehill delivered."}
{"text":"My friend and I arrived with high hopes of sitting on the patio, as it has a great view.  It turned out the entire upstairs was booked for a private party so we had to sit in the restaurant area, which had no patrons.  It felt pretty lame and we were disappointed.  The restaurant has a classy feel to it, at least.

I felt better after trying a fantastic beverage, which I believe was a raspberry bellini-type cocktail.  We also shared the Basil Artichoke Dip, which was delicious.  It's an expensive appetizer, though (in my frugal opinion).

I'd like to return at some point and actually enjoy the patio."}
{"text":"Been several times to this place.. is right around the corner from my house and it is fantastic nice urban tavern and great service.
Have the wings or burgers you cant go wrong"}
{"text":"We had a very mixed dinner experience at the tavern. Our appetizer - prawns in tomato sauce - was absolutely delicious. The lamb burger was good, too. I liked the combination of lamb and goat cheese. Unfortunately the lamb shank was not so great. It somehow tasted like corned beef, suggesting that it was not freshly made.

Service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"We didn't plan to come to Stonehill but because the restaurant we wanted to go to had a long line-up.  It was Remembrance Day.  We found out from the really nice waiter that the restaurant was giving out free meals to veterans.  How nice!  

The restaurant has dark wood, a 2 - storey wine room that is accessed by its own elevator!  Upstairs is the tavern.  Downstairs is the restaurant.  We sat in the restaurant.  

We ordered the White Wine and Chorizo Mussels as an appy - Really, really good!  Came with 2 pieces of garlic bread to sop up the lovely tomatoey sauce.

It was a cool day so I had the French Onion Soup - nice dark beef broth with croutons and melted cheese all over the top of the soup.  It was a little on the salty side but otherwise hot and good.

Entrees - I had the Lamb Burger on Whole wheat bun.  I was happy they had whole wheat buns!  The burger came with my choice of green salad in that wonderful and light lemony vinagrette dressing.  The whole lamb burger was delicious especially the melted blue cheese.  The rest of the table ordered the Lamb Spaghetti - a big hit!, the Roasted Vegetable Sandwich on Focacia - the focacia is a little tough to eat as it's kinda crunchy and the Scallop Linguini - also a big hit!

On the whole, our experience @ Stonehill was a 5 star one!  We are talking about coming back for dinner again!"}
