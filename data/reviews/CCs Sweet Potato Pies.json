{"text":"The steak and cheese is the best sandwich in the mountain island lake area hands down.   Very friendly owners/staff.  Don't leave without some cupcakes or a pie."}
{"text":"Great sweet potato pies and steak subs! Awesome service. This is the only place near Mt Holly Huntersville rd that has Good food!"}
{"text":"Great cheese steaks...as an business owner in Charlotte ..give it up...if you can't be there on posted hours you done your self in. ... I will never return... And stop telling friends of your quality...live and learn..good luck.."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best pie spots in the Charlotte area! Always can expect great service."}
{"text":"My first impressions ... I loved the cute design on the outside. So homey and really gave me the feeling of family. But upon entering, the inside seating area was unorganized, some parts cluttered and messy with just stuff. I imagine the tables were clean but I definitely would not want to eat in. Being it is a small place, the front dine in area can still be clean, uncluttered in the corners with stuff and a simple place to eat and enjoy your food. Thankfully I did not need to eat in and took to go. The bakery display case was ghetto looking. I didn't like that there small cupcakes (the kind you bake at home where the cake part is a little flat and in standard cupcake size and there is no real artistry to the icing). I definitely would not pay for a cupcake. Then there were like a couple of upside down small trays I guess to give the desserts height in the display case. I just feel the display was ghetto and cheap looking. Made me \"feel\" the place and food lacked quality. Anyhow, aside from that, we decide to order anyway.   \"Cafe\" - We ordered a chili slaw hot dog combo, 11.6\" phillysteak sandwich and an apple pie.  As for the phillysteak sandwich, delicious. Chili dog was as expected. I might come back for the phillysteak sandwich. The limited menu does not bother me if you sell what you're good at!   \"Pie\" - The apple pie was really homemade and just delicious. WE would definitely be back for that! And being CC's sells pecan and sweet potato pie as well, we will definitely want to try that too!   I'd say it was worth the trip to CC's. CC's really is sweet and has excellent customer service! So why the 4 stars instead of 5,  I just personally feel I wish the inside atmosphere and seating area could use some spiffing up and so it could look clean. Clutter and being unorganized could give the customers the feeling that if the place is not right in the front where we can see it, then the back where food is prepared must not be good neither. Also, make your bakery display nicer, get tips on how to make it look delicious and sell itself. And for me, those things are important."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Called to see what time was opening. She said 11am. Drove 20 min out of my way to get a pie or 3. I arrived at opening time and sweet potatoe pies won't be ready for at least 45 more min?????  So why are you opening at 11 if your not prepared for customers until 1145? And why would you say when I called your main product wouldnt be ready at 11am. I will never know if they are good or not because I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"When my husband and I travel we always find out the state dessert and try it at the best place. Well CCs Pie and Cafe is hands down the best sweet potato pie in North Carolina! The pie is just the right consistency, with flaky crust (my favorite part) thats not too thick. If you're into options try her pecan pie too, simply divine!  Ms CC is a Philly native and also offered famous Philly eats, philly cheese steaks and chili dogs, stop in for lunch and dessert."}
{"text":"I'll describe my experience in linear fashion. Small parking lot but extra spaces if you're willing to walk. Upon entering, I was accosted by a funky, mildewing smell. There was a large fan blowing so not sure what was going on. I came for the sweet potato pie that everyone's been raving about. I agree with another review that the display case was ghetto and very sparse. Not appealing at all but I decided to forge ahead despite the smell and weird display. The owner, CiCi, came out promptly and introduced herself. I told her that if been hearing great things about them on Yelp and she thanked me for coming in. I ordered two 5\" sweet potato pies and showed her my 10% off Yelp offer for first time check in. She frowned slightly but accepted the offer but only after saying \"let me see if I can accept that\" SERIOUSLY? It's a measly $1 off and you're scrutinizing the coupon? Now for the pies. They were just ok, in my opinion. I've had similar or better. They didn't knock my socks off. I've made a better sweet potato pie than this. But they were were good. I want to support a local business so I'll be back if only to see what the hoopla is about that Philly Cheesesteak."}
{"text":"I was recently in the area and remembered the sample of pie I received at a Taste of Charlotte so it was imperative that I stop by for more. The service was great and that sweet potato pie was even better! I had the 5\" pie and it was perfect - very light, no overpowering flavor, and a crisp crust!  The Philly cheese steak was good also. I will definitely return for more sweet potato pie and to try the red velvet cake!"}
{"text":"Omggg heavenly need to return soon. Mrs CC is the best. Such a sweet lady and makes omg the best cheesteaks woohoo. Again we really need to go soon again.  (Update) Locale is closed but Mrs CC still sells all kinds of pies. Just give her a call."}
{"text":"Best Cheese Steak in the south and the pecan pie is outstanding. The best part is Mrs. CC....she is awesome. If you haven't gone or are in the area you must check it out."}
{"text":"Some the Best pies I've ever tasted (I'm 50) you can taste the love and quality ingredients .. Also a mean philly cheese steak!!"}
{"text":"What a great find my dear hubby made today.  The Philly Cheese Steak sub was just melt in your mouth delicious.  I have been to Philly, this is better.   Missy CC made sure my diabetic husband tried the \"sugar free\" sweet potato pie.  Amazing!!  Will be our new favorite place to eat in Mountain Island area. Janis & Steve."}
{"text":"great food, and great desserts.  The strawberry cupcakes and slice of chocolate cake were heavenly.   You could tell they were made from scratch.  She has a limited menu for savory food, but I don't mind that.  Limit it and knock it out of the park with what you do offer, and CC does just that!"}
{"text":"Went to Taste of Charlotte and got a mini pecan pie. Holy mole! It was so good that I rudely licked the crumbs from my plate.   The filling had the perfect ratio of pecans and brown sugary goodness. And the crust....if I could simply just order a crust from them filled with whipped cream, I would be in my ever-loving-glory.  In terms of pies it seems like they know what they are doing. I'm excited to head over there for a full pie with my 10% off coupon they gave me at the event. I will update my review when I actually try some other goodies."}
{"text":"The best Philly  Cheesesteak I have had in Charlotte since moving here. They use real amoroso rolls from up north. Strange mix pies and cheese steaks, but WELL worth the trip if you're in the mood for a taste of home. The sweet potato pies are awesome also."}
