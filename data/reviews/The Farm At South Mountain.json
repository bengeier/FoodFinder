{"text":"One of my best girlfriends got married here this weekend and all I have to say is AMAZING!!!!! The location is spectacular and a hidden gem in the middle of the desert. I am from the Midwest and it really felt like I was back home. 

I have had brunch at the cafe here and walked around the property when my friend decided it was the location for her Wedding. The BBQ dinner that was prepared for the Wedding reception was so yummy!!! And the staff was amazing and stealthlike...things were always taken care of but you hardly noticed that the staff was there and when you did they were so accomodating and friendly.

My only caution is to any bride who thinks this is a beautiful setting but does not consider that you are at a FARM! The bride's dress was filthy after dragging it across the ground and everyone's shoes were dusty but no one at this Wedding cared. If this might bother you or guests, this may not be the place for you. I urged female friends to wear wedges or flats because heels will dig right into the grass at the Farm.

Regardless of the event, go check out the Farm at South Mountain. You can grab lunch and sit at one of the picnic tables and just enjoy the beauty of the property.

Thank you to The Farm for making my friend's Wedding day the best it could possibly be!"}
{"text":"An absolutely delicious brunch with honest food and eager to please staff. Youll definitely see me again."}
{"text":"The food was very fresh and so good but quite pricey. It was $10.95 for a sandwich or salad and that didn't include anything else. Their Portabella with roasted pepper sandwich was to die for.  Unless we have another Groupon it won't be a place we'd go on a regular basis."}
{"text":"This was a great place to stop for lunch. A great sandwich and bowl of soup. The setting with the flowers and trees makes you feel  miles away from a big city nearby. Lots of picnic tables and cafe tables with a  live flower on each one. If you want a relaxing lunch and a stress reliever, you need to find this place and relax. Makes you feel  like you are on a picnic. Your food comes in a paper lined old fashioned basket. Put this on your to do list. They also serve fine dining at dinnertime."}
{"text":"I recently took a friend who was visiting from Chicago here and he looked around and said, \"I thought you guys only had desert and cactus\".  Well, that's the usual stereotype but no, we have a lot of farms; you should have seen the look on his face when I pointed out some of the cotton fields in the south and east valley!.

As others have said, this is just a gem of a place. I just can't think of a more peaceful place to enjoy a meal.  My go-to spot is the Morning Glory Cafe. Good coffee, fresh-pressed juice from local citrus and the huevos rancheros are delicious.  After eating I like to walk through the pecan trees and check out the garden plots.

Nice, relaxing spot. Great way to start the day."}
{"text":"Probably the best mushrooms I've ever had.  Beef was nice.  Service a little slow but ambiance was great."}
{"text":"Breakfast is fantastic.  Work on the coffee selection.  Only thing holding back a star is no French press coffee or an espresso machine"}
{"text":"It's hard to find a good, fresh place to eat, but this place is it. It's definitely a go for vegetarians and meat eaters alike but who are also concerned about ingredients. The environment is cool, but if I was reviewing based on comfort, I would take 2 stars off. I have a problem sometimes eating outdoors due to my bird phobia, and unfortunately this place is infested with birds . Just wished they had more indoor dining. But the  food is great, I just have my wife order for me, and I take home. Problem solved"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great food, great activities.

The Farm at South Mountain is a favorite to take family to spend a morning or early afternoon.

Prices can be expensive, it's easy to pick and choose a bunch of things that look tasty and be astounded by the price.  But the food is worth it."}
{"text":"love love love it! What a quaint little piece of heaven. Located south phoenix...I wasn't sure what this place would look like as we kept driving south but as we walked onto the property it felt as if you were no longer in the big overcrowded city. We went to the morning glory cafe for breakfast. The food was wonderful and the presentation was great! I highly recommend it. It would make a wonderful place for a baby or wedding shower!!"}
{"text":"Food was good but wayyyyy over-priced for what we got.  We're not big on Claim Jumper sized portions but this place had tiny portions for the price.  Ambiance was great & the setting was beautiful.  Staff was very friendly, too."}
{"text":"I don't know whether this is a real farm that is serving home-grown food, or a Potemkin Village masquerading as a farm. The sandwiches were fine, if heavy on the mayo. And how can any self-respecting farm be serving sodas sweetened with artificial flavors and corn syrup in this day and age? A sandwich in a picnic basket doth not maketh Ye Olde Farm."}
{"text":"Not that great! For the prices I expected much better food. Lacked that special something and pretty small portions. Outdoor breakfast seating was beautiful and staff was sweet. Just left me desiring more...."}
{"text":"This a great place to go with friends, family or lover. You can enjoy sunshine and organic fresh sandwich and cakes."}
{"text":"Wonderful food. This was a little more expensive than I had expected, but the food was lovely. The location was nice, it's unusual tonnage a space like this in the area. Good vegetarian options and fun to bring out of town guests."}
{"text":"I loved coming here!  It was like having a picnic.  Healthy food for lunch and a tasty cookie for desert.  This would be a fun place for a wedding shower or any party.  The food is a little pricey, but very good."}
{"text":"I came to this place for the cafe restaurant, but obviously, it has much more than produce and restaurant. Great for friends and family to hangout."}
{"text":"Mother's Day Brunch was average. Coffee was cold, other dishes barely warm. LONG wait at the one outdoor restroom in a trailer. Tables were crowded together, making it difficult to navigate back to the buffet area for anything. High price for medicocre meal that didn't even include a mimosa. Those were extra! The grounds are definitely beautiful, though."}
{"text":"Love love love.


The environment is what you come here for.

Try out the local veggie stand. All the produce was grown on the farm you are surrounded by.

The food is served in a picnic basket, which is genius. Great concept with picnic tables and all.

A tad on the pricer side, but you get the scenery.

Many weddings or events are held on the grounds and when you visit you will see why."}
{"text":"I love The Farm! We do eat at their restaurants, however we also brown bag a lunch and enjoy a beautiful day lounging in the Pecan Grove. 

I can't rave enough about the location, the people, everything!

Oh, and we got married there, which makes it even more special :)"}
{"text":"We have enjoyed the Farm before, but this was very disappointing.  Service was super slow and there were a number of people waiting in line with reservations for over 30 minutes.  Plus, there was an automatic 20% gratuity because of the \"holiday,\" which was an insult given the service.  Too many other restaurants in the area to put up with this.  SO SAD!!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal food with disappointing service which is why they rate dropped to 4 instead of 5 stars. Everything here is truly farm to table and the restaurant actually is the house transformed into the table seating area. Outside there is more seating with strung lighting surround several tables creating a romantic ambiance.
I came here for dinner and had the tasting menu- started off with ceviche, cucumber salad on toasted baguette. This was followed by butternut squash and goat cheese. The butternut squash was poured into the soup bowl containing the goat cheese at the table. Main course was trout and grass fed steak. The trout was crispy and the steak perfectly cooked and so well flavored. Dessert was equally delish. 
I had a gin and citrus cocktail which was too sweet. I should have opted for the wine pairing instead. 
The tasting menu was served incredibly slow- my dinner took 3 hours to complete from beginning to end and a lot of down time was noted between meals.
I would highly recommend giving this restaurant a shot."}
{"text":"My wife had a tuna sandwich and I had the flank steak. We bot had a small iced tea. The total was $31. which is quite high for  two drinks & sandwhiches with no sides. 
The rating I gave was an overall rating.
 To break it down, I would say the food was good, but not exceptional, so 4 stars. The value rating would be 1 star, based on just two base sandwhiches & two drinks. Atmophere; you eat outside and most of the tables are right off 32nd st so it's a little noisy. Just basic plastic chairs so nothing fancy, so 3 stars. The staff here gets 5 stars; nice and friendly.
I came here to scheck out what all the high ratings were on both yelp and urban spoon. I don't think I will come back."}
{"text":"Love to go for brunch on Sunday's. The food is always great but the service can be slow. If you're not in a hurry, enjoy the atmosphere...that's half the reason you should go there. They are supposed to have great bloody mary's however last time we were there they ran out of their mix and instead of telling us they ran out, they made a new mix with whole tomatoes. Although I give them credit for improvising I couldn't even drink through the straw it was so thick! It also had absolutely no flavor.  I ended up paying for a whole tomato in a glass even after I told the waitress I was unhappy with the drink. The food was delicious!"}
{"text":"Such a sweet and organic place to visit. The food is great and the setting is amazing. Great for a relaxing Sunday, or hosting an event! Lots of gluten free options as well."}
{"text":"Really great, really fresh food.  Definitely on the pricey side, but if you don't go too often, it's not a huge deal.  Outdoor seating is nice, and the Fall/Winter/Spring weather in Phoenix makes it really pleasant.  They aren't open in the summer, FYI."}
{"text":"I had Dinner at Quiessence, and I love the idea of this place.  I really appreciate their effort to support local agriculture and to promote this type of eating.  Well done!  BUT, the food was WAY TOO SALTY.  Unexcusable, especially for the price! I'd probably try it again if they reduced the salt - I could hardly taste those local flavors!
Otherwise, the portions were unusual - some dishes really tiny, and some way larger than expected.  The menu ideas and presentations were unique and worth checking out.  The wine pours could be a little more generous.  The ginger-ale soda was DELICIOUS."}
{"text":"The Farm has such a special place in my heart! I love going there for lunch and feeling like I am getting out of the desert and the city. It is so peaceful and quiet there. I have only been to Morning Glory and The Farm Kitchen, so I can't speak for the dinner restaurant. My cousin also had her reception here for her wedding and it was beautiful!"}
{"text":"the sandwich was amazing....but defintiely not worth $9. I've definitely had better.  It didn't even come with a side. great location and outdoor seating, but overrated."}
{"text":"The Morning Glory Cafe is excellent.  My boyfriend took me here for the first time to meet some of his family, and I just fell in love.  I like the atmosphere and the food is hearty.  I scheduled a morning brunch with all of my girlfriends there a few weeks ago and it went off without a hitch.  The staff is great!"}
{"text":"AS GOOD AS IT GETS. I just got married at The Farm in April and it was nothing short of PERFECTION. Kelsey and Nikki are so so great! And the rest of The Farm staff was so helpful and accommodating throughout the whole wedding day. I couldn't be happier with where we celebrated our union in marriage."}
{"text":"Favorite place to go in Phoenix! Great atmosphere and food with quality products and service...from farm to table.  Morning Glory is our favorite, but you can't go wrong with any of their restaurants.  Quiessence is amazing, but pricey so we only go on special occasions. Recommended to all!"}
{"text":"The food was ok.  It was nice being outside as long as the weather is ok.  My wife had a hair in her food which is never good.  It was a little pricey considering the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"First time here in about 10 years today. Over priced then...over priced now. Two sandwiches (no side or pickle included) and two lemonaides. $31.00 for a bland and tasteless tuna salad sandwich and a sloppy joe sandwich. And to top it off. The homemade rickety tables with table legs fabricated from rebar are so badly designed that you can't get your legs under the table. If I'm back in another 10 years it will probably be too soon."}
{"text":"Had high expectations based on their web site and the farm to table concept. I was especially excited because our daughter is a vegan and they made special mention to let them know any special dietary concerns and they would prepare something special 

I knew we were in trouble when the bread baksket came with 2 micro rolls and 3 ciabatta slices. The rolls were not vegan so all they gave us were 3 small ciabatta pieces one for each and 2 micro rolls for the non vegans. I thought they could have tossed something extra in for the vegan diner.

Our sever seemed annoyed by our questions. I finally stopped asking about the tasting menu as she was giving us short brief answers that only lead to more questions and I was getting frustrated. 

 She did explain that for the vegan entree they had prepared a cassoulet of beans and vegetables. The beans were raw and the vegetables were potatoes and carrots with very little seasoning. I thought they had a whole garden of veggies to choose from and this was the best they could do. When we asked what appetizer was available our server offered a couple salads on the menu without the dressing which contained cream. She did not offer a substitute just a dry salad. I have been offered better vegan options at chain restaurants 

I ordered the kabocha squash soup. It looked like the broth was steaming in the container when it came to the table but when they poured it in the cold bowl with the cold goat cheese mousse it all turned cold. It had promise but was too cold. I would have mentioned it to the server if I could have found her.  My entree was the strip steak half of the steak was way over salted and the other half had nothing. Also the steak was not a steak but rather several slices of steak. The broccoli was so salty I could not eat it. 

My husband ordered the two wash ranch Cornish hen which really should have been called two wash ranch half a Cornish hen. There was no potato salad as the menu said but rather a ton of baked potato slices. He also ordered the chefs spread as an appetizer which we were told had to be ordered for 2 people which the menu does not say.  It came with 3 slices of meat and cheese not 4 but 3 so you can each have 1 1/2. For $12.00 each I think another slice of meat and cheese would not have put them out of business. 

Had the server stopped by we would have ordered more wine for dinner but again could not locate her."}
{"text":"The grounds were so green and peaceful that the food came second to the environment. I tried the still-warm-out-of-the-oven cranberry-walnut scone and the American Breakfast. The scone was definitely a do-again, but I think I will pass on the applewood smoked bacon next time. I also tasted the waffle, and I would order it just for the blossom honey whipped cream alone...it's fantastically light and delicious. The coffee was okay, but it was on the acidic side, and not really worth the $2.25. Nonetheless, the service was great and the walk around the gardens was inspiring. If you check out the chicken coop, don't touch the fence - it's electric."}
{"text":"It was fun to be on a farm for breakfast but I wasn't nearly as enthusiastic as my friend was about this place.  We had breakfast at Morning Glory Cafe.  I had the American Breakfast with eggs, herb buttermilk biscuit, potatoes and applewood smoked bacon.  The saving grace for me is that they serve Revolution tea.  It comes in the cutest little individual package.  It's cool that they use local products and everything they do is environmentally-friendly.  I just didn't enjoy sitting outside on plastic chairs under trees that dropped leaves and stuff into my plate."}
{"text":"I had an old groupon that was sitting there waiting to be used.  I wanted something new to do for a birthday lunch but did not want to go to the normal lunches.  I also wanted somewhere i could take a dog with me to enjoy the amazing weather in Arizona.  
There is not much parking outside the front of the restaurant but they have an entire parking lot across the street.  From the second that you walk onto the property to the second that you leave you so not even feel like you are in Arizona.  
They have a very select menu but let me say everything sounds amazing and even better everything that we order was outstanding.  I could not have asked for a better afternoon to spend with a friend.  We were able to sit at some picnic benches that were out under old pecan trees.
The only thing that could be worked on is the attitude of the associates.  They were not as happy and energetic that they could have been.  Other than that this is a great place and cant wait to enjoy the amazing and fresh food of this restaurant again."}
{"text":"A really cool experience.  Located on a large property that takes you instantly from the city into this quaint goodness of organic gardens and Pecan trees.  It's a dining-out experience, so the best time to go is on nice days.  The food is perfect, picnic style food.  I had the tuna sandwich which was fantastic.  Overall, the whole experience of dining out in a picnic setting was  most memorable.  Take your friends and family !!!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast experience on a working farm. The food tasted fresh and was plentiful. After breakfast, a stroll around the grounds was just perfect on a sunny Sunday morning."}
{"text":"Just attended the bid band special event.  We were disappointed the the picnic basket venue along with the additional production charge for this particular venue.   
Based on our experience, we will no longer attended their future \"big bad\" events.  There was relatively minimal value."}
{"text":"Will not be revisiting.....went for the live band they advertised on their site, no live band was there! Read some reviews about the food..... it was not good (and overpriced).  Waitress said the best item on the menu was the Eggs Benedict (so I ordered it) FAIL. No taste, mushy and deli ham, REALLY??!  Selve serve Coffee, Tea and Lemonade for $2.25 and no splenda! It was a beautiful day but due to the enormous amount of flys  we were unable to enjoy the weather.  Overall this place could be much beter with just a little effort but I am afraid this will not happen sorry to the Farm but I will not be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I ate a chicken sandwich at the Farm Kitchen for lunch and couldn't be more pleased, it was delicious!! The menu carries a good selection, the food is fresh, and the desserts.... WOW! 

It is a little pricey - I paid $32 for 2 sandwiches/2chips/2drinks. Parking is confusing - especially if its your first time. I went at about noon and drove into the property only to get stuck. Too many cars are trying to come in/out of a small space which creates a mess. There is a lot directly across the street that handles the overflow - just park there! 

The employees are very pleasant and the overall feel of the location as a whole is very welcoming. I definitely recommend it - can't wait to try the breakfast and dinner restaurants :)"}
{"text":"I love coming here when the weather starts to cool off.  The picnic benches are aligned by beautiful large trees for shade. The food is fresh and so good. It's quite pricey but you pay for quality."}
{"text":"Oh, I'm a fan.  Ever since we moved out from Washington, DC - three years ago and stumbled on this green oasis in the midst of all the brown.  Anytime I miss the East Coast,  we visit the Farm at South Mountain.  It turns out that The Farm is convenient to us as well.  But I'm happy to know that folks come from all over the Valley to enjoy the ambiance.

We love the breakfast.  YOU HAVE TO TRY THE MONTE CRISTO breakfast sandwich - it's a little slice of heaven (actually it's a huge, gimundo slide of french toast stuffed with an egg, ham, and swiss - except the description is a little fancier than what I've outlined ).

We've been going religiously for three years - almost every weekend when they are open.   The wait staff seems to revolve frequently- which is sad, because I love it when people know my name (it makes me feel special)."}
{"text":"The Farm is a whimsical little natural paradise with great fresh food coming from THE farm itself. I've actually only been to one of the restaurants nestled in the gardens, The Morning Glory Cafe--and am never disappointed. I love going there mid morning on the weekends when they have a couple vendors out front. I'll always take family there when they come visit PHX and we'll spend time walking around through the veggies growing next to the restaurant and then to the little shops selling plants, jellies, books, etc. My favorite would have to be the tree that wears a knitted \"sweater\". Very practical because, #1 trees need sweaters, and # 2 it gets damn chilly here in AZ. 
I happened upon an outdoor yoga class once as well while waiting for a table...all kinds of good ,clean, hippie, fun:) 
So, all in all, The Farm has absolutely delectable, fresh, invigorating food that isn't all that pricey and even though you may have to wait a lil while for a table at peak brunch times, it usually turns into a lovely stroll through the gardens and fun shops (fairly painless in my point of view)."}
{"text":"Back East, where rolling hills, mature tree stands and grass are not a novelty, people would laugh at this place's prices and go next door. It is a testament to how desperate Phoenicians are for a break from the monotony of dirt, cacti and more dirt that this place is overflowing with patronage. Aside from the aforementioned foliage nothing about the experience is special. Not the cafeteria line window pick-up service, not the plastic chairs sitting on wood chips, not the flies, not the mauve-tinged, faux-country motif.

The food itself is fresh, local and delicious. I had the Italian sandwich with some chips and lemonade, and I can truly say it was an excellent sandwich. But then again, at $10, it doesn't need to be an excellent sandwich. It needs to be a sandwich that melts my mind with its overwhelming greatness. Unfortunately, this was not the case. I dropped $15 total for my meal, and for half that I could have had a similar eating experience at Subway. Eating is only half of what people obviously come to the Farm for, so if you're longing for the green hills of yore, you may find the satisfaction you crave."}
{"text":"Went to Morning Glory and had their french toast with candied pecans. It was delicious! Loved being outside and enjoyed the atmosphere so much."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic.   The service was excellent.  The wine list was interesting and varied.  Highly recommend this resteraunt"}
{"text":"Amazing brunch location.   Beautiful scenery, good food and service, this is an ideal place to bring someone from out of town or that special someone for a great brunch experience."}
{"text":"although the location and seating outside were great the place scored very low on recent visit for lunch. very pricy for what u get pre made salads looked small and unappelling. our sandwiches were lacking the main ingreditants which left them very small mostly bread which was dry. soup was cold a..even with our groupon coupon our bill for 3 people was $20 would not recommend this place .."}
{"text":"Put it this way: Every guest I have in Phoenix, I force to get the Monte Cristo at Morning Glory. It is just that good."}
{"text":"A different world all together.  A cleverly operated dinning experience.  Unexpected    good quality breakfast amist a peaceful farm land location."}
{"text":"Beautiful grounds, however, the service and food were not good. We knew it was busy, but the waitress actually forgot to put our order in. We waited very long just to get drinks, and were at the table for over an hour. The over-easy eggs were under-cooked and the scrambled eggs looked like Egg Beaters. The seating was uncomfortable, as well. Way over priced for this experience."}
{"text":"Had an amazing TAB (Turkey, Apple) sandwich and Seafood Soup. Above all, best Pecan Pie ever! The location has wonderful outdoor seating surrounded by green trees."}
{"text":"Our favorite place to host birthday parties.....we are going on our 4th consecutive year!
Casual, fun and the most beautiful pecan trees to sit under for a great picnic lunch. We have so many wonderful memories."}
{"text":"My husband and I had lunch ther with friends. It is a beautiful place and the menu has very good selections. The place is very pretty and has much to offer. I need to go back to view the gift shop and the rest. I highly remcommend The Farm at South Mountain."}
{"text":"The farm is fun place you can take the kids and sit on a bench it or can be romantic breakfast for 2
 - fell in love with the fresh yogurt/granola and French toast with sweet syrup for breakfast! Better to eat on a nice cool day and then walk around after and enjoy the greenery ;)"}
{"text":"I love Morning Glory for Sunday brunch!  I've had everything from their oatmeal to the Monte Cristo to fruit, and everything has been delicious.  I'm a fan of bringing guests from out of town, because it feels like you're escaping from Phoenix.  All the staff have been really nice too -- one very sweet waitress always remembers my puppy and brings her a bowl of water even if she isn't waiting on my table."}
{"text":"Yum, been for lunch a few times and love everything I get. Careful crossing the street that can be a challenge but worth it!!"}
{"text":"The ambience and the setting is awsome but i expected a lot more from the food.  Came out slighlty on the cool side so by the time I was finishing my plate it was warm at best.  We had breakfast but i will be going back to try their lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Food is delicious with nice size servings. However, our server Gabby needs to work on her skills. After our food was served she did not check on us to see how things were going."}
{"text":"What an amazing place for breakfast!  There is usually a wait, but you wan walk around the beautiful grounds and stop into the gift shop.  Don't forget to get the waffles!"}
{"text":"I have wanted to go here for brunch for a long time.  Finally made it there this past weekend.  Great setting -- so pretty and unique and reminds that Phoenix can be awesome.

I arrived at 11:30 and had a 20 minute wait. No big as it gave me time to walk the grounds.  Was seated, odered the ham & cheese omelletee with home fries.  Food took about 30 minutes, again no biggie but something to be aware of if you are hungry and/or with children.

Food was dropped off with not much fan fare.  Immedietly I saw a black hair sticking out of the fries.  Eww and Hello!  Did no one see this?  Ate the omelette, was very good but found two more very long black hairs intertwined in the fries.  It was gross.  One hair falls out --ok its unfortunate, but this...was like someone had pulled these long hairs out in wrapped them up in the fries.

No thanks."}
{"text":"love the ambience of the whole farm. i had the pulled pork sandwich and the bread pudding. bread pudding was phenomenal, very moist and not too sweet. the other desserts looked amazing too which i must come back to try. they also serve cocktails like sangrias which were a little overpriced at $9 for a little cup but it was nice to be able to drink and walk around exploring the establishment"}
{"text":"Best reason ever for a $20 lunch.  

Yes, it's pricey, but delicious.  If you can't respect the fact that you can actually talk to the people who grew or made the ingredients going into your mouth and appreciate how rare that opportunity is these days, then please just go to Quiznos and stay away from my Farm.   

I enjoy coming here solo, with a book or magazine and some time to kill.  By the time I stroll through the garden and spy on the canoodling couples under trees, my lunch is ready. 

If it's not, then I start snacking on the potato salad or garden salad or chocolate chip cookie that I was trying to save- I have no shame.  

The most recent visit, I enjoyed the Ham and Cheese sandwich.  Although it seemed so unassuming, the multi-grain bread was perfectly crisp at the edges and delightful warm and sturdy without being too grainy.  The ham was freshly carved, the bacon perfectly crispy, dijon/mayo blend just the right amount, field greens, red onion, tomato...all divine.  I really wanted a more mellow cheese- was it swiss? I wanted provolone or mozz- something that didn't want to compete with the rest of the sandwich.  There are no bad feelings, I still loved it.  

I polished it off with some iced green tea and a shamelessly delicious chocolate chip cookie.  I can't wait to come back.  

They lost a star because I didn't see a sign anywhere indicating the $1 \"service charge\" on my receipt...after I already tipped a dollar.  A little heads up would've been nice.  

My tips to a successful lunch at the Farm:

1. Ladies, wear wedges or flats because your heels will get crushed in the gravel driveway and then stuck in the cobblestone patio ...and people like me will be forced to silently laugh at you thinking you're looking so stylish.

2. Don't bother getting frustrated trying to park inside the property, just go across the street and cross it while reliving your childhood \"Frogger\" dreams 

3. Bring your patience if you're here at peak lunch time!  Everyone else is in line too, but isn't this place damn cute?  Oh, and when you come back to get a refill, please say \"excuse me\" to the people patiently drooling in line, there's no need to flaunt that you've already had your food and are now on round 2 of drinks, that's just mean"}
{"text":"Amazing Dinner with a large party that allowed us to order many things to share! Cheese and fruit plates were wonderful. Great wine pairings too. I had a very good duck dish, that after almost 2 months I cannot stop thinking about. Eating outside with the soft lighting and warm March weather was special and felt like summer anywhere else."}
{"text":"So different and refreshing. I love the set up and fresh ingrediants, great expierence, I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"In theory, this place could be amazing but the execution and menu doesn't reflect a farm to table creative culinary experience... more like just a regular old lunch place. You get the farms ambience a little but it is too jammed back and chaotic to feel relaxed. I hope they do add more plant based creative dishes to really enhance the farm to table experience."}
{"text":"Great good but long wait time to be seated and get our food order.  Additional parking is across the street so be prepared for a little bit of a walk. One of my favorite things, it is dog friendly! Make sure to tell the Hostess when you put your name on the wait list there is a dog in your party.  It does matter where you will be sat and could extend or help your wait time. We learned the hard way. Don't make our mistake!"}
{"text":"My SO and I stopped by today for lunch.  The first thing you notice when you walk in is that the salads are all pre-prepared and in a cold case.  That pretty much knocked any of the salads off the menu for me. :P  

Between the two of us, we had the meatball sandwich, tomato basil soup, and financier.  You pick up your own food in a basket, which is cute.  The meatball sandwich was pretty good. The meatballs were a good sized, and the bread was very fresh and warm.  The tomato basil soup seemed suspiciously similar to the tomato sauce on top of the meatball sandwich (both the SO and I noticed it).... The best part of the meal may have been the financier -- we choose this one out of the pastries because we've never tried this before. It was good, really good.

The food is pricey for what you get - sandwiches are $10, but they are big.

You eat outside, which can be fun. However, there are a lot of birds, bees, ant hills, etc, which some customers may not like. Afterwards, we walked around to the Morning Glory cafe, which seemed really busy."}
{"text":"Awesome vibe and good food. Go for the experience of a farm brunch not excellent food and you will be very happy."}
{"text":"??????????????????????????????????12????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"I was so anxious to try this place as I found it online before leaving Canada. Maybe my expectations were a little too high but I was rather disappointed with The Farm. On March 18, 2017, I went there for the first time expecting it to be a wonderful experience. I invited friends from Canada and we were all disappointed with our meals. The music was pleasant but that was pretty well the only pleasant part of the experience. I ordered a salad which was nothing special and nowhere near as fresh as it should have been and my friend ordered a spinach salad which she did not eat as it was just a pile of dry spinach. My partner ordered a sandwich which consisted of stale bread. Needless to say, I will not be back."}
{"text":"The food is great in and of itself, however, the real treat is the ambiance.  When you're at The Farm, you don't feel like you're in Phoenix.  It's quiet, serene and unlike anything else in the area."}
{"text":"Basically Obsessed with this place. The restaurant options are all amazing, Quiessence is basically the best thing ever. Obsessed with the pasta and desserts here, the romantic ambience is picture perfect."}
{"text":"Wonderful breakfast, great service , the freshest Fruits & veggie. Worth the trip. Plus great little gift shop."}
{"text":"Ihana paikka hieman Phoenixin keskustan ulkopuolella! The Farm tarjoaa freesejä, herkullisia salaatteja, sekä maukkaita sandwicheja, ja tietenkin myös laajan valikoiman erilaisia jälkiruokaherkkuja. Ainekset ovat tuoreita, suoraan omalta tilalta tuotuja. Palvelu ystävällistä, ja tunnelma todella viihtyisä.

Ruokailun jälkeen voi viettää hetken kävellen pekaanipuulehdossa. Paikassa voi myös järjestää vaikka hääjuhlia. Pimeällä paikkaa valaisevat pekaanipuiden väleille riputetut sadat hehkulamput..."}
{"text":"Wow...what a cool place.  The Mr. and I visit Phoenix frequently as he is a Arizona Cardinals fan.  We stay a few days and hit a game.  We found this place via Yelp and are so glad we did.  Delicious food and great outdoor ambience.  The wait staff were friendly and the food was quick.  I think my only heart break was I was in the mood for a mocha or a latte and there was nothing offered like that...hubby wanted a Soda and nothing like that either....maybe they stick with cleaner ops?  Anyway...the food was great.  Walking the farm after the meal is great and helps work off your cals  next time we plan to get a quick bite from the front stand and enjoy the grounds a bit more - pic-nic."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere if you enjoy eating outdoors. I'll ditto what other reviewers have said regarding the cost of the food...it's pricey. We've been here for breakfast and lunch and enjoyed it both times however average cost for a sandwich, drink and chips is $20."}
{"text":"Work trip CHANDLER AZ WAS A HIT !! THANK YOU for a great night! dinner and fun with networking with Comdata exchange 2018 this year.  Each night we have events and by far this was the best dinner and networking event.  They put together a large farm to table event and it was a hit. I could not stop eating the beef wellington.  SOOOGOOD"}
{"text":"Driving through a pecan grove, parking your car next to a freshly plowed field and sitting under the iron wood trees enjoying an all natural breakfast, you forget your near downtown Phoenix! Most of the food comes straight from the farm itself, like the pecans on top of your fluffy French toast. This peaceful place offers a morning  experience in which I hope to enjoy many times. The most simplistic things can often be the most entertaining. This place is surreal."}
{"text":"4 stars because when the weather is good in the Valley, we should be outdoors eating in a shaded pecan grove... rather than playing on the Wii or walking inside the mall.  Came here for a baby shower hosted by another... so I haven't tried the full monty for food, but it's in my mind for any event I might have to host..."}
{"text":"Ok where do I start!? 
First of all its a beautiful farm in south phx! it's beautiful, the food is amazing and fresh literally farm to table. I went just a couple days ago and the heat may have made it a bit uncomfortable but at the end of it I just loved my breakfast and mimosa. This is a cute spot to start off your weekend with a great and healthy breakfast."}
{"text":"This place was priced like a fine gourmet restaurant, but the food and service were mediocre at best--not at all worth the expenditure.  

Everyone in my party of four agreed that the food was much too salty.  The portions were tiny, like a tasting menu but with four courses instead of the usual six.  

Worst of all, the server asked if any of us had food allergies, I told her I was gluten intolerant, and then they brought me pasta!  

Once you get past the litter and graffiti and industry in the surrounding neighborhood, nobody could deny that the setting of the farm is really special and charming.  The only other good thing I can say about the place is that we were able to get a really great bottle of wine . . . but then one of the servers came out to congratulate my husband on his taste in wine--and not all that subtly--which was pretty awkward in a small, crowded room.  

In sum, it's like the place is trying super hard to be posh but just doesn't have the food quality or experienced, professional staff to back up the attitude or the pricing."}
{"text":"Healthy and outdoorsy. 

Sandwhiches are pretty darn good.  The desserts are the best ever.

Pricey and very nice place."}
{"text":"Wonderful place to dine al fresco. Freshest food."}
{"text":"This place.  We are staying at the Legacy Golf Resort and that we would grab a quick bite there since we were driving by.  Such a fun atmosphere !  And, fantastic food that has a unique flare and is healthy.  I also like the casual environment where you can play outdoor games with the family. Highly recommend this spot!!!"}
{"text":"The Farm at South Mountain is a splendid little slice of the country- right here in the middle of the desert!

The plentiful green grass spotted with picnic tables makes me want to plan a family reunion. There are gardens and walkways to explore. From first glance, The Farm is a quaint, family-run farmhouse.

Visit Morning Glory Cafe for breakfast and you won't be disappointed. I've personally enjoyed the Morning Glory Benedict on several occasions, while my brother is a big fan of the Farm Monte Cristo. Both dishes are made with as many local ingredients as possible... mmm... local-icious. 

The Farm Monte Cristo is about as close as any breakfast food gets to \"groin-grabbingly delicious.\" (a la Homer Simpson) It's slow baked ham, over easy eggs, and melted cheese between two generous pieces of French Toast. Served with warm maple syrup, this is it, folks. The grand-daddy of breakfast foods. 

The service here is generally solid. Our servers tend to be interesting, friendly, and adorable- all good qualities to have when you're serving breakfast to someone who isn't happy about being up early.

I'll return... and return... and return. I'm hooked.

I only wish Morning Glory wasn't closed for the summer! Killing me."}
{"text":"It's more like a 4.5...Finally made it after saying I wanted to try it out for years. We came around 11 and got a salad and sandwich to share, two iced teas and two cookies. Super cute spot out at the front counter and wished there was more tables in the shade. It was quite warm out at the tables in the grove and our salad was a getting a little soggy from the warmth by the time we got our sandwich. Skip the peanut butter cookie (which I never say) and go for the cherry chocolate. I'm still thinking about it a week later.

Wandered and absolutely loved the different spots for events and the garden was beautiful. 

Might want to ask your neighbor to move their giant trucks away from the fence line though if you are aiming for photo ops around the perimeter. I'm guessing it's about to slow down for the lunch crowd with the summer heat which is a bummer -- the grove is so great but way too exposed for summer."}
{"text":"One hour wait - totally ok with that. But an additional hour wait for our food? Not acceptable. After one hour of sitting there with no food, the waitress approached us, said \"something\" had happened to our order and would we like a scone. We had no choice but to say \"yes\" but when we were given ONE scone to split between the 4 of us, we were floored. The meal came 15 minutes later. While it was very good, the service and lack of care about the one hour and 15 minute wait will have to cause us to look elsewhere for brunch."}
{"text":"This is such a neat place to dine.  My colleagues decided to take me out for a birthday lunch a few weeks ago to a place I've never been before ... The Farm at South Mountain.  It was 5 of us in total and we all ordered different items.  Unfortunately I don't remember everything everyone ordered but I do remember items that stood out to me the most:
There was a special sandwich which features chicken, Granny Smith's apples, bacon, avocado and something else.  It was called the California Club or California Cobb I believe.  I did not get this sandwich but wish I had.  If you're at the Farm and it's on the menu do yourself a favor and order it.  I PROMISE you won't be disappointed.  The Tuna sandwich was also a winner in my book.  It tasted really fresh as if it was made to order.  I'm not sure if it was or not but it definitely taste like it.

I did not care of the side order of potato salad (too bland) and the spinach salad.  There was nothing spectacular about the spinach salad it all. We all also really enjoyed the Citrus Green Tea.  Be sure to a lot ample time for lunch because you'll wait a while for your lunch.  Not a problem when it's so fresh like that.

I'll can't wait to return to try some of the other sandwiches."}
{"text":"First time on YELP , I am searching to add more stars for this place. I am so overwhelmed to write review for this place .We have no plans for this place but all of a sudden we stopped by on our way. They have a large parking space on the other side of the road which is completely free. Once we entered we found a restaurant on our right (The Farm Kitchen - If I remember right). Early in the morning, you can see couples walking hand in hand and you can hear the birds chirping with a very pleasant and calm weather.

I would like to appreciate the team with my review for their cleanliness and maintaining it so well. Also this place is perfect for wedding venues. However the day we went the farm is not having much stuff as we heard the farm owner maya is planning to close it. 

They have two more restaurants on the back with a beautiful outdoor seatings one could ask for. Any dating places in search off - I would recommend this place a must go."}
{"text":"I visited the Farm for the first time today and frankly, was disappointed. I was expecting freshly prepared items and homegrown produce, and instead was met with a cafeteria counter of prepackaged salads that looked like they came straight from Circle K. Even the iced tea was not freshly brewed, but came from a dispenser. 

The Red Grape and Walnut salad was good, but the plastic container it came in was too small for tossing ingredients and for $10 I expected something MUCH better and bigger. I've heard the soups are good and the desserts looked awesome, but I'm not sure if I'll return."}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this place, but will never be back, recommend you don't waste your time and money.
My husband and I decided to try a new place for Valentine's Day, so I went on line and found the Valentine's Day Basket, and thought what a fun experience that would be; romantic and something different.
This experience was anything but fun from the beginning.  To start with, the basket advertisement tells you that you get: 2 gourmet sandwiches, 2 sides, tea or lemonade, 1 cupid\"s cupcake to share and a souvenir.   When we called to make our reservation, as suggested, the woman was very short and rude with us.  She wanted to know what sandwiches we wanted, when I told her I would have to look at the menu, which I had pulled up because we just looked at it, she told me to call her back when we knew what we wanted.  Hmmm... knew what we wanted, just had to look at the name again.  Ok, so we call back, get the same \"happy\" lady, she takes our sandwich and drink order, but then tells us that one of the \"sides\" that we selected was not offered, that there were only three sides to choose from.  It would have helped our experience greatly if the web had 1. Told you to select your sandwich prior to calling (and have the name ready so the \"happy\" lady didn't hang up on you), and 2. To list your sides that you could choose from.  
Wrote the ordering off as an employee having a bad day, and decided to make the best of it.  When we showed up at The Farm, had to choose from three lines, there were no signs to direct you, asked people in line and found out that we wanted line two.  When we received our basket and found a place that we wanted to sit, my husband showed me his pasta salad side, there were literally 4 noodles!  It wasn't even half full!  The sandwich was nothing to sing about, it was just a sandwich, DEFINITELY not a gourmet sandwich.  The cupcake was ok, moist but no flavor.  
Then came our last slap in the face... your souvenir...a $5 coupon to go the their very over priced specialty shop.  Again... Really!?  I shop at specialty shops all the time, and this was a disgrace. The selection was terrible, and looked as if someone who didn't know what they were doing just set things out and WAY over priced them.  Love to support local artist and businesses, but these clearly were not local artist.
This entire process left my husband and myself feeling like we were cattle, moving through getting processed... hmmm... it is a farm, I guess.  We were thinking about trying the dinner one night, not now.  For what we paid, we could have gone to many different establishments, and received a better meal, and much better customer service."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful food, service and atmosphere. We found this place by searching Yelp and were so glad we did. There is a lunch place in front that's cafeteria style. Then u take your food picnic style out on the grass and enjoy it. Really nice. Then all the way in the back of the farm is a breakfast place. It's great too. Nice staff, great food and outdoor seating. Really a perfect outing."}
{"text":"Oh how I love this hidden gem. I kept hearing people say how it didn't feel like we were in Phoenix. Green grass, beautiful trees. Tried two restaurants so far and both have been phenomenal. I have attended yoga classes in the grove. If you love yoga, you have to take a class there. Bring your friends and have a picnic lunch after."}
{"text":"Service:          3 out of 5
Food:              3 out of 5
Atmosphere:   5 out of 5

Overall, it was an excellent place. Long wait for table and service, but the food was decent and the entire atmosphere was amazing."}
{"text":"4.5 but rounded up. 

Maybe it's just me... and I don't go out to farms and gardens much, but the whole idea of having a restaurant with a garden and farm makes pretty good sense. You can tell your greens are picked from the garden and where the eggs come from. 

The Farm has salads, sandwiches, soups, baked goods, and desserts but their main emphasis is sandwich. We picked the special of the day - Sicilian Chicken but asked it on French bread and not focaccia.  =0)

I loved the sandwich! A little sweet and tangy but tamed by the light mayo. Delicious chicken and ... lovely toasted bread. It came together wonderfully...and in a basket too! 

I love how The Farm has picnic tables and little cafe tables out ... so that you can eat out in the fields (bring a blanket)! Some tables have umbrellas to shade you and some don't.

Oh... and free refills! We got their homemade lemonade... light and sweet. Perfect for the sunny Arizona day!  

Parking: You can park across the street at their lot or you can park on the unpaved road next to the picnic tables. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~

I wanted to take my hubby somewhere special because he had driven out from LA just to see me....I gave him the option of going to a Man vs. Food place or here. I'm really glad he decided on this place! I took a look at their Valentine's menu...and wished  I could be here for it!

It's definitely special and unique!"}
{"text":"Cool place to eat.  Kinda pricey, but the food and ambiance is great.   Take a minute to walk around the grounds.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wow. I was blown away by The Farm. From the moment we got there the vibe was cool, comfortable and relaxed. Listened to great guitar and vocal duet playing a mix of old and new. Loud enough to hear but quiet enough not to interfere with conversation. 
The food was of the hook. Fresh and local and you could taste the difference. If I lived nearby I'd eat here every day breakfast lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"The farm is fresh delicious food. The whole grounds is perfect. They do the most adorable events such as Christmas Movies at night. A tad expensive but worth every penny. And the twinkly lights add to my obsession with this place"}
{"text":"Farm At South Mountain is such a gift to the city of Phoenix. As a public school teacher, I often stress to my students the importance of eating healthier and more sustainable local foods. It is wonderful to have such a great farm so close to town so that children can see that food should be grown from the ground and that it doesn't just come from packaging. I would love to take my students here one day for a field trip to walk the grounds.

I came here with a large group of friends for brunch. The wait for our large group was a little over an hour but the time went by quickly as we walked around the many shops and fields. The restaurant also has plenty of water and iced tea available for patrons as they waited for their table.

I really enjoyed roaming the grounds here and dining with my friends. Most of us really enjoyed our meals, but the waffle I had was not worth it. Everyone else's entrees looked much better than mine. I cannot wait to come back here to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere -- the restaurant is on a working garden/farm and you sit at picnic tables. Great place for breakfast or brunch. It could be brutal if it's hot outside, but when we went (mid-Sept) it felt great in the shade. Portion sizes are large. I had the Farm Omelet with country potatoes and my wife had the Breakfast Sandwich. Both were tasty."}
{"text":"This is some CLASSY brunch.  I love it.

Hot damn, it was warm this morning, but not enough to make a difference on a 5-star place like The Farm at South Mountain.  I was in a rush to try this place out this weekend before it closed.  (FYI, it closes every summer from June - September.)

You pull up to the place in the midst of this vast city of ours to find a huge, and shady (in a good way) farm before you.  At the Morning Glory Cafe, the small menu has just the right mix of items to please just about anyone.  Lots of veggie options to be had here, btw (Bonnie would DROOL with desire here).

The food is really incredible.  They had my favorite dish on the menu - croque madame.  It had eggs, and some delicious asiago cheese and black forest ham on some crusty artisanal bread.  Ahh.  It was missing the bechamel sauce, but it made up for it with freshly-grown asparagus.  How did they know that's my favorite veggie?  I attribute it to kismet, of course.  It was accompanied by some terrific oven roasted potatoes baked in some spices and oil.  Nice...

The patio is cute in a rustic way.  Think checker tablecloths and white plastic chairs.  Not exactly sexy, but hey, it fits in the grand scheme of the farm.  They have a self serve area for water, lemonade and tea.  

The mimosas here are the best part.  For only $7.50 you get your own mini champagne bottle and orange juice.  So you're getting the better end of the bargain with about a mimosa and a half! 

Service here was a bit slow to start.  But after paying the check I spot a wandering blueberry scone that is calling my name.  (Even better, is their scones are featured in Cooking Light magazine too.  Man I love this place.) So I give in, place an order and ask for it to go.  She brings it out.  I ask to pay in cash, since she already ran my debit card, and she says \"Don't worry about it.\"  

CLASSY.  Classy, with a C.  The scone was DELICIOUS, btw.  Nice touch, and I leave her an extra tip for it. 

Prices are higher than average for Phoenix.  Expect to throw down about $40 for two.  But let me tell ya, that will be the best $40 you've spent in a while. 

I am now eager to try the other restaurants here.  Now if only September would hurry up and arrive...."}
{"text":"What an incredible experience and delicious food!!  Best granola I've had and I love granola!!  It was nice outside, not a ton of bugs, like I thought there may have been.  Good service, we were seated quickly and it was busy. Will return."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. It's one of the only things in Arizona that really reminds me of Northern California's awesome farm-to-table places near wine country. Great service, great food, and one of the most romantic places for a date, anniversary, picnic, etc. I'd give this place five stars, but it's a little pricier than it should be, and I'm trying to be more frugal with my star-giving. An easy-to-miss spot that many Phoenix locals don't even know about! Treat your love to a multi-course dinner here and horseback riding in South Mountain. They'll love it."}
{"text":"A unique park-like setting, located at the back of a modest farm.  Many lovely things to look at while you wait.  The brunch is served very casually, on paper plates, which seems strange for what is essentially gourmet food, but maybe it keeps the costs down."}
{"text":"The Farm is great and it's a lovely place for breakfast on a nice day. The acreage it's on is very peaceful and serene. I like it a lot."}
{"text":"So after reading the recent Yelp reviews on this a little oasis; that is great food, beautiful surroundings, but horrible service ~ we went there with a little trepidation, not expecting much, but we were pleasantly surprised. Our first time there and the staff could not be more helpful and informative. It was really easy peasy, you order lunch, they give you a number and wait for your little picnic basket. Lots of places to sit, free refills of their delicious lemonade or iced tea.  Dog friendly (there is a dog station, but it's a good idea to bring your own waste bags and water bowl). After lunch we took a leisurely stroll around the entire grounds and were just amazed at all the different places to just sit and relax and enjoy the beautiful surroundings. Definitely going back, the food is just fresh and delicious, and the farm closes for the summer so definitely want to take advantage of this place a few more times."}
{"text":"Let me count the ways I love this place...Three different restaurants, succulent sales, beautiful scenery, shops, farmer's market....The Farm at South Mountain is officially one of my favorite places ever...In the world. 

Great breakfast. Excellent lunch. I cannot wait to try dinner here. 

Oh, the bacon, chicken, apple, date, tomato sandwich and the delicious cherry, white chocolate bread pudding, I adore thee. If going on a weekend, make sure you give yourself a lot of time. Take some time to wander, enjoy the grounds and the rock wall. Then go have another slice of the bread pudding, 'cause it's worth it."}
{"text":"We had a LOVELY brunch here earlier this year. I'm bummed I didn't write our server's name down because she was amazing. I do remember she had a beautiful accent-maybe someone will be able to fill in the blank here!!!
Perfect during the spring months while the weather is gorgeous and the little boutique is adorable.
One of our favorite spots, still!"}
{"text":"We went for brunch on the recommendation of some friends that live in the area.  What a great choice!  The setting is fantastic....you're just outside in a great little garden area.  And the food was amazing.  I'm a bit of a champagne nut (I think I mention champagne in every review I write....) and I loved the fact that they give you a mini bottle and a mini carafe of oj to mix yourself!  I also found it funny that the woman at the table next to ours used all of her OJ and I used only a little bit....mmmmm...its just to color, right? ;)"}
{"text":"What a beautiful lunch...

I had lunch at The Farm Kitchen where they serve fresh salads, sandwiches, soups, baked goods and freshly squeezed beverages like orange juice and lemonade. 

This has to have been one of the best lunches I've had which had a lot to do with the scenery but the food was also fantastic. 

I had a middle eastern soup with potatoes, chickpeas and spinach which was packed with great flavors and served with a piece of naan as well as half a ham & cheese sandwich that came with a slice of tomato, greens, dijon and creamy avocados. I ate everything up! Your food is served in wooden baskets and that's one detail that adds to this entire experience. And the fresh lemonade squeezed from their own trees was phenomenal. 

Everything comes together with the environment you're in. The setting is so beautiful that all I could think about was painting it. There are shaded seats around the restaurant as well as picnic style tables in the orchards. Birds are singing and the sun is shining through slivers of all the umbrellas. It's hard not to enjoy every single bite of your food here and I know that's a reason it all tasted even better.

If you find yourself in this area check this place out. There are several different restaurants here and they all have different hours and open dates so verify before getting out here. 

They also offer massages, weddings & special events here as there are several different businesses scattered around the farm. 

I really fell in love with this place and I think you'll enjoy it as well."}
{"text":"A great place for organic sandwiches and soups and enjoy outside at the sun."}
{"text":"The service here is spotty and inattentive.  We actually had to remind our waitress twice to bring us our silverware.  Also, the breakfast skillet I ordered was less than hearty.  It came out in a mini iron skillet and was about the size of my palm.  For the price, I would have expected a far healthier portion.  The pretty outdoor setting is what makes me give these guys 3 stars instead of 2."}
{"text":"It says breakfast and brunch, yet no menu to back that up... Weak. How many people look for brunch? I saw farm so I felt that'd be a great way to start the day with some comfort scenery on a sunny day. Fail"}
{"text":"Great place to take out of town guests when the weather is nice!"}
{"text":"25 minutes for a table after we were told the wait would be 15. 15 minutes for a server to come to the table. Terrible mimosas. 45 minutes to get breakfast. Everyone else got served before us and left. Service was terrible. Terrible. Trailer for a bathroom? Now if that's not ghetto I don't know what is? Dead trees everywhere. What is the allure I'll never know."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years and have yet to be disappointed. It is a tad bit pricey but everything else is top notch! Excellent food, service, selection, top quality ingredients and great ambiance. And consistently great every time! My favorite is the pecan turkey waldorf salad sandwich and the roasted sweet potato salad but everything is great really! Great place for kids or a business lunch and anywhere in between!"}
{"text":"Really good for vegetarians and vegans mostly salads and sandwiches and you get to sit outside and look at what's in season in the garden. If you have kids they will love seeing all the plants and animals at the farm."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast, was delicious! My boyfriend and I went there for our two year anniversary and the atmosphere was perfect. The staff was friendly and very professional. There is also a separate restaurant for lunch and another for dinner. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"What a great place. A working farm offering home grown food breakfast was so fresh they offer lunch and dinner too. Because I am an event florist and stylist in Sam Diego I have to give them a high five for the venue you can say I do here it would be a beautiful backdrop to your wedding and reception in the cooler months ."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast!  You can definitely tell the difference between fresh eggs and store bought eggs.  Had the French Toast, Egg, Ham And Swiss breakfast sandwich.....awesome!  We went during the week and did not have to wait for seating."}
{"text":"Lunch. Pretty epic sandwich in a lovely setting. Got there 2pm on Monday and we pretty much had the run of the place.; You know the drill, order and then they put everything into a picnic basket. The rows of tables are a bit dated and you should eat as far away from the ordering area due to alot of flies - no flies bothered us during the meal.
  This was one of my top 5 sandwiches. The CBLT. It had crunchy bacon bits on the bottom layer, sliced chicken breast and the secret ingredient was dates in a jam form and sliced apples and field greens. It was $11, but well worth it and the soup special that day was chicken posole - also quite tasty.
   It is also hard not to pick up some desert as you order, everything looks great, but we had a top notch version of carrot cake, layered with thick cream cheese and nuts on top. Simply put,
 this was a great lunch"}
{"text":"This place is TOTALLY a hidden Gem! They have 3 restaurants here, that is all outdoor  seating, so I would highly recommend coming here for food, or just a relaxing time at the farm here."}
{"text":"Unique concept. Great brunch - go early to avoid a wait - they don't take reservations. Order the mimosas, breakfast burrito and biscuits. Friendly service. Relaxing grounds to tour, shop and learn."}
{"text":"Thanks to Mercy B...I stopped by this place for lunch at the Farm while I was in Phoenix.  I had the albacore tuna sandwich which had jicama in it! I've never heard of such a thing, but I have to tell you it was delicious! We sat out at the picnic tables soaking up the rays eating our sandwiches and drinking the homemade lemonade which wasn't too sweet or sour...just the way I like it! : )

The Farm's menu consists of sandwiches and salads..but boy, do they have tons of little \"treats\"!  Cookies, tarts, pies, and so much more...but only one that caught my eye was the this thing I'm calling the \"Coconut Ball\"! It looked sooo good and was looking forward to getting one after my lunch..but I was too full! BOO!!  So if anyone stops by that place and tries it, you'll have to report how good it was! : )  - I'd definitely stop by here again the next time I'm down this way!"}
{"text":"What a cute setting!  Loved my sandwich from the little cafe.  Great selection of healthy sandwiches, salads, and fruit.  Lots of picnic tables to sit at, or bring a blanket and picnic on the grass.  The boys loved going to see the chickens after we ate.  Only downside is there's not a lot of parking near the cafe, we had to park just across the street, but it's a short walk."}
{"text":"Beautifully rustic. Spur of the moment visit for breakfast. We weren't sure what to expect. The location was beautiful, the food was filling, tasty and fresh. 

2 plus hour wait time for a table but there was plenty of space to walk around, sit and relax. Very relaxing atmosphere.

We'll be back"}
{"text":"The farm is a great place for events or just to sit for an excellent lunch in a secret garden setting. Sandwiches are on point!"}
{"text":"Yumminess of all yumminess!  Fresh sandwiches!  Crisp salads!  Delicious cookies!  My friend and I ate at the Farm Kitchen around 2PM on a Sunday and all the ready-made salads and baked goods, sans bars, were 50% off!

I enjoyed my chicken pesto sandwich and garlic soup, but my favorite part of the meal was the chocolate chip cherry cookie.  They make a mean pecan pie too!

There's only outdoor seating, which I'm sure is normally fine, but it was pretty chilly the day we went."}
{"text":"Yes, the line to order was long.
Yes, the wait for the food was a good 15 minutes.  
And, yes, the food was worth it!

I had the Tuscan Chicken Sandwich.  The bread and the veggies were very fresh and the creamy balsamic was perfect.  Normally served on focaccia, but they were out so it was on a baguette.  Probably the softest baguette I've ever had; no scraping up the roof of my mouth!  The boy enjoyed the Pulled Pork Sandwich and we split a piece of the Pecan Pie.  YUMMY!!

As far as the wait for the food goes, just get a piece of pie while you're in line and eat dessert first!  One note, you can't order salads from the register.  The salads in the cooler are the only ones they have.  Once they are out, they're out.  If you want a salad, you might want to go early, or at least before 1:30.  They serve lunch until 3:00.

While we were eating, I witnessed one woman pull a plastic grocery bag out of her purse, then pull two baggies out of the plastic bag, and put the second half of her sandwich in the baggie and offer the other baggie to her friend.  I haven't quite decided if this is a genius move or a crazy-bag-lady move.   Either way, she was prepared!

One thing that could have made my lunch at The Farm a five-star experience would be a nice glass of bubbly or crisp white wine to go with my lunch.  I'm sure the boy would have enjoyed a nice local brew with his pulled pork sandwich.

Lunch at The Farm reminded me of my lunch at the Olive Mill except for the drinks (bummer) and the 45-minute drive (cool).  

Yes, it was a great lunch!
And, yes, we will be back!"}
{"text":"this place is great, but i am partial to anywhere that offers outside dining possibilities. actually, it's only outside dining, picnic tables, to be exact.

the Farm is just that, with an attached lunch counter to get chicken salad sandwiches with pecans, both fresh from on site. Tons of tall, shady trees, picnic tables and wandering ducks and birds to delight the kiddies."}
{"text":"I just moved here from CA and I had NO IDEA that something like this could exist in the desert. The farm is absolutely gorgeous!

This review is based on the Breakfast restaurant, not the lunch or dinner restaurant. I haven't tried those places yet.

We have come here twice now for Breakfast. I wanted to give the place another shot before writing a review.

The first time we came on a Sunday. The place was packed, expect to wait at least 30 minutes. The table we were seated at was slanted since the tree roots had brought up the pavement. Neg 1.

The back of the menu talks about how the Farm is into recycling, the environment, etc... So I told the server that I wanted the eggs benedict. I will pay the full price of the meal but I just wanted half an order (so I didn't waste any food). We spent about 5 min going back and forth about how if I just got half an order I would still have to pay full price (as I already said I would). Then someone else came out and told me I would have to pay full price, I said I understood that, I just didn't want to waste any food. Finally, my order comes out she says \"sorry the kitchen is too busy so you have to get the full order.\"

My eggs were okay but I think they forgot to toast the muffins so the meal didn't taste good.

The second time we went there, we decided to try going during the week so it wouldn't be as busy. Well, we got the same sucky server. She forgot to bring me my orange juice until the end of the meal and forgot to bring me my lemon. The menu is smaller during the week. The biscuits didn't taste fresh which is one of their signature items. The bacon tasted and felt like it had been on the burner all morning. She brought out sausages for my husband when he ordered bacon.

We will not be going there for breakfast again... If we do, we will bring our own breakfast and eat at the picnic tables."}
{"text":"Awesome fresh sandwich!  Had the Tuscon and the entire thing was delicious.  Minus a star for the flavored iced teas - a little too diluted.

But yeah, this is what a $10 sandwich should taste like!"}
{"text":"We went early on Saturday didn't have to wait for a table. All the staff was very friendly, they have a drink bar for you to get your own water, tea, etc. the menu has so many delicious sounding things took us about 20 minutes to decide on just one thing to eat haha. The food is phenomenal minus their gravy which was very runny and not thicker like most gravy and besides that it didn't taste very good either. Everything else that we ordered rocked. Bacon was on point, their biscuits were tasty as well and their breakfast sandwiches were awesome! I'll definitely be going back to try the rest of the menu. It is outside barn type seating which we went on a morning when the weather was nice. Extra points is that their dining area being outside is dog friendly:)"}
{"text":"This is my all time favorite breakfast place in Phoenix.  It's just far enough away from me that I can take the scooter out for a \"long\" ride.  You ALWAYS have to wait for a table because this place is busy, but while you wait, you can get your coffee and have a walk around the farm.  It's a great way to spend your morning."}
{"text":"Fantastic spot, try the smoked brisket hash! The prices are a little high (2.95 for coffee, but free refills) but well worth it if you're looking for a nice bfast/brunch. Get there early, weekends get busy!! Bring your dog!"}
{"text":"We only had breakfast/ brunch at the Morning Glory, so i can't comment on any other feature of the Farm

- Cute place; looks like a small, family-run farm
- loads of picnic tables (and as we were driving out around 11a, we noticed a long line of cars parked along the gravel) 
- the setting would be great for baby and wedding showers, great for groups 

Food:
I had the Gourmet  Wild Mushroom Omelet with a side of sausage
- Home fries and Biscuit were a 3*
- Omelet was ok, with a too-thick hollandaise sauce; 2.5* at best
- Sausages were awful; really dry and cold
- Coffee was lukewarm; not very tasty

Everyone else's food looked pretty good, including the benedicts and tacos."}
{"text":"We ate at morning glory cafe yesterday. It was a beautiful setting on a perfect cool spring day. The service was good but, alas, the food not so much. We ordered three different menu items and each one was sub-standard. We are reluctant to try the lunch or dinner, now."}
{"text":"Seriously one of my favorite places to go for breakfast. Beautiful place and amazingly delicious and healthy food!!! I could walk around there all day. I love all the string lights they have hanging throughout the trees! We happened to go on a day where they had people selling items that they made and I found the most beautiful rings!! Such a good morning spent with my boyfriend before I headed off to work. :)"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and a BEAUTIFUL atmosphere. 

The Farm is a perfect place to spend an afternoon with a huge group or just one special person. If you're going, try to reserve some extra time, there's a lot of nice walking to be done and it's just not worth going if you can't relax and enjoy the environment.

A couple words of caution: Don't bother going in the summer. The whole experience is about being outside and, well...

Also (and this is the restaurant's only real downfall) the sandwiches are PRICEY! Most average around $10 and that's before you add on a side or drink."}
{"text":"Great get-away picnic setting. Farm to table eats that are tasty and well prepared.  A casual and enjoyable experience"}
{"text":"it is a place that everyone wants to like just because of its topography.Yes it is different from most here in AZ. Nice and peaceful. But I can find that in my back yard. I do not think the food is too spiffy. My sandwich bread was so hard it came close to cutting my gums and yes I do have healthy gums. The taste was of no particular flavour to the point that I can not remember what I ate. I get the feeling the customers are trying to hard too. This place is just not for me."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE the Farm at South Mountain, especially during the Springtime! It is my go-to spot to bring guests for breakfast or lunch when they are visiting AZ. Beyond just eating here, there is so much to see! From their gardens, to their animals, to their cute shops and cafes, it is the perfect spot to relax on a sunny AZ afternoon with good friends and family. It is SUPER pet friendly and a great place for kiddos to run free. 

I love their smaller cafe where you order at the counter and they call your number. I pretty much always get their chicken salad sandwich and a tropical black iced tea. They also have delicious salads with homemade dressings, fresh fruit, and the baked goods are out of this world! 

I've also heard that it is a gorgeous wedding venue! I know that i'll be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Beautiful, charming farm with 2 restaurants on the premises. Lots of beautiful crops, pecan trees, awnings and pergolas to drool over. There's even a chicken coop! I honestly could spend all day here. I wish I had known about this place when planning my wedding, it's absolutely gorgeous."}
{"text":"I'm not really sure what's wrong with me when I choose to eat a Lean Cuisine under the glare of fluorescent lighting over sitting outside at a farm on my lunch break. That's just sick. 

Being outside and seeing landscapes that resemble nature is sorely missing in the day-to-day grind. I believe John Ruskin said, \"Sunshine is delicious ...\" and then a bunch of other crap. It doesn't matter what he said after, because he had me at the sunshine part. It is delicious to sit outside and feel those warm rays heat up my soul as I stuff my face with roasted turkey. If I were in a video game, my energy bars would be getting a boost, ding ding ding, with each bite of that sandwich. Also, it would be the worlds worst video game. I wish I could go one step further and languish the afternoon away like a lady who lunches. Ooh, and wear an impossibly large hat to hide my delicate, alabaster skin. No proper lady lets the sun give her premature age spots, regardless of how delicious it is."}
{"text":"March 2018:  interesting restaurant on huge farm like grounds.  The lunch items are awesome!  Walk around the place, it goes way back with chickens and a nice garden.  Good service and great food in a beautiful location."}
{"text":"We loved this place! We were able to eat breakfast, walk around the beautiful grounds, enjoy the outdoors and fresh air, and take some beautiful photos!"}
{"text":"Fantastic experience from start to finish.

We arrived on a Sunday morning and put our name in for a table at the Morning Glory Cafe. It was a 25 minute wait, but we were directed to the self serve coffee/beverage area immediately (we paid for it later on our bill). The setting is so beautiful that the wait didn't matter.

My husband had a brisket omelet, while I  had vegan roasted veggie dish. Both were excellent as were the meals our friends had. We were not rushed and enjoyed a leisurely brunch.

The farm itself is beautiful with small shops, a place for weddings and lots of room to roam around. We spent hours walking, talking, sitting in shaded areas. I can think of no better way to spend a lazy afternoon."}
{"text":"This is a pretty cool place with good lunch options and a nice overall vibe. Well worth dropping by and trying just about any of the sandwiches on the menu. Sit outside and enjoy the cool farm & trees."}
{"text":"I've been this beautiful farm last weekend for our brunch. We had to wait for an hour When we arrived at the morning glory cafe. During that time, we bought a fresh mimosa near the entrance of cafe and walked around the farm and park.  So, Not so bored. My dog also really enjoyed the farm. she looked so happy. 
The food was fresh but not so special taste. It Was normal. But the farm is so special! 
We will go back for the picnic soon"}
{"text":"My sister got married here March of last year, we had a great experience. All the pictures turned out beautiful, the area for the bride was very cute! The one down fall to the situation was the bathroom. I was unimpressed! Everything else was wonderful! 

The food was incredible!! Probably the best part of the wedding :) The staff was all very accommodating and helpful! I would recommend The Farm!"}
{"text":"Okay okay, now under new ownership. Is that good? Still not sure. Food is good. 

The Farm little pick & go food is definitely good, but a bit pricey. The outdoor patio area is nice and relaxing. This self serve type eatery is good for those that want some time to themselves or don't want a lot of interruptions. 

The Morning Glory restaurant=I had Farm Omelet, always a good go-to; fresh veg & goat cheese. Beautiful environment. Love the feeling of supporting a local business/farm. Problem: food is over-priced, not the BEST tasting and the service is lacking. Why do the servers take so long when there's only a few people there and more than enough servers?! Would it kill the servers to smile and actually show some interest and joy that they have customers, not to mention a job in this economy. I'll try again, but hoping these reviews are taken to heart/consideration.


Overall this farm could really be more amazing and have a serious cult following if these key things were handled properly:
*act like you care
*price a bit more realistically
*customer service with a SMILE!
*have a little cute store of local home-made art, as well as Maya's Farm merch"}
{"text":"Deep within a pecan grove, is a small organic farm that has a small cafe. which prepares its food with using the organic vegetables and herbs.  

It is an anomaly and is always popular for those who want to get away from suburban sprawl.  

It is a little pricey for breakfast, but it is worth the splurge."}
{"text":"With a \"moo-moo\" here and a \"moo-moo\" there... Everywhere a \"moo-moo\"!  Sorry that was the first thing that came to mind when I was  asked to go to the farm for lunch.   As first timers , we were a little confused on where we suppose to start, but there was a long line of people, with no food, holding menu's... so we started there. As a vegetarian I was pleasantly surprised with the variety in their menu.  In fact I changed my mind five times before we got up to order.  I ended up with a 1/2 Farm Fresh Veggie sandwich, a cup of bean soup and finished up with butternut squash creme brulee. The food was excellent, in fact I had to restrain from licking my soup bowl clean.  The only downside is it took forever to come out, and to top it off, I had to get a redo on my sandwich because they smothered it in Mayo (Which I do not eat, EVER!).  Despite the semi-chaotic service and delivery, it's hard to complain about getting a great meal, and enjoying in such a beautiful setting. The tables are set up along side the farm, and surrounded by huge trees.  I am really looking forward to coming back and giving their breakfast a shot!"}
{"text":"If you go at the right time of the yr everything is in bloom and it is soo pretty. I went there the first time and ate the french toast which is amazing!,

Now heres were they lost a star. I ate breakfast there and I got egg whites and some other stuff. I went back to my hotel, about 3 hours later I had the 2nd worste food poisoning. I was in the bathroom the whole day and couldnt leave the next day for check out. I in no way could drive back w/o using a bathroom in 5 mins.

I lost about 5 lbs so they earned that star back ;)"}
{"text":"If you like spending $25 per person for a breakfast that includes flies, bird droppings and an extremely long wait (40 min) then this is for you!!!  In our exhaustive search for a breakfast restaurant in PHX that has NY style home fries, this unfortunately fails.  Although the Benedict itself was good, the tiny portions, soggy overseasoned home fries and aforementioned service/atmosphere make this outdoor experience a good place to skip.  I'll see you at Matt's, that is far worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Over priced sandwiches!!!
Tasteless Flank Steak Sandwich (nothing else) and a bottled coke $16
Surrounding area with picnic tables was nice though."}
{"text":"My husband and I got married here and it could not have been a better experience. We recently returned for our 1 year anniversary and wanted to treat ourselves at Quiessence. They called us the day before our reservation to ask about seating preference, if there were any dietary restrictions and if we were celebrating anything. We told them we wanted inside due to the hugs, had one vegetarian and we're celebrating our one year anniversary. Upon arrival we were greeted with a complimentary celebratory glass of wine and a statement of gratitude for returning. Our waitress was Narah and she was such a sweet heart. We ordered the chef's board and she took us through everything on the board. We then ordered our entrees. My husband got the aged new York strip and I got the vegetarian white whine risotto with seasonal vegetables. Both our meals were spectacular. We will absolutely be returning as a anniversary tradition!"}
{"text":"If you've been looking for the best kept secret in Phoenix, this isn't really you're place, cause it's not that much of a secret anymore. If you're looking for an urban escape into the farming community of Phoenix past, then be sure to stop in for a visit.  I've always heard good things about Morning Glory café here at the farm at south mountain for brunch on the weekends, we had a visitor in town, wanted food, was looking for an experience we've never had, one plus one equals two, so we ended up at the farm!

I'm so glad we chose to dine at morning glory, the entire place is super cool. Lined in an old pecan grove, there are a handful of shops to check out, some artist studios, two or three places to eat, and the grounds are a great place to take in also. This was the perfect stop for brunch before we headed up to the top of south mountain to check out the views. For anyone in the market, this is also a wedding venue, it's a venue like none other in Phoenix - if you're looking for that. :-)

Happy Yelping Phoenix, be sure to put this on your bucket list for Phoenix if you haven't been yet!"}
{"text":"First time at Farm at South Mountain. What a hidden gem!  Beautiful gardens, shops, restaurants and mini-community. 

Our table (all the tables) was set on a shaded patio with gorgeous views of the naturally-landscaped gardens. My wife ordered the American Breakfast, while I had the Morning Glory Spinach Benedict.  The drinks were self serve. 

Our meal arrived in five minutes. She got two eggs, sausage, skillet potatoes and a buttermilk biscuit. The eggs were cooked perfectly, along with the crisp/soft potatoes. My plate had toasted muffins, cooked spinach, loads of farm ham, poached eggs with loads of hollandaise, plus the same yummy potatoes. 

The meal was excellent. A little pricey ($33 for the two meals and two drinks, plus tip) but absolutely worth it. The service was outstanding and the view: all five stars. 

This was one of the best breakfasts I've had in my LIFE, considering the whole package. 

Get here!  They close for summer."}
{"text":"Went here in December....breakfast for two, food came out in a matter of 5-7 minutes...it wasn't a particularly busy Sunday morning because it had rained all morning, but there was dry seating available. Had no problems with the service, it was pretty much on par with what you would expect from a restaurant. The location of the restaurant is what will leave you satiated. Fresh air, great place to walk around after your meal. The breakfast itself was great..i had the waffles, she had the truffle eggs, they both tasted great, but i will say that i preferred the eggs. The waffles are more than filling and will quickly fill your sugar tooth, so if you are looking for something healthier and less sweet - the eggs are definitely the way to go."}
{"text":"Fresh organic foods in a park like setting. I enjoy lunch here. It's casual, the weathers lovely and the good. I haven't ordered anything yet that knocks my socks off but I have no complaints about the food either. I do find it mildly annoying that they have various gift-ables for sell but NONE of them have prices on it. You can ask someone and they'll look it up but the people behind the counter are busy. If I want to know prices on a few items it's frustrating for the employees and even more so for other diners waiting to order. PLEASE take some time to mark these items or put a price list out, you'd make more sales for sure."}
{"text":"Great taste,  not overly heavy, but crappy service and the coffee is terrible."}
{"text":"Love everything about this place! I love all the homemade treats, goodies, and dressings. It's very quaint and the food is yummy. Great place to enjoy breakfast or lunch on a beautiful day!"}
{"text":"I am partial, my husband and I got married here last May and it was everything we could have wanted. Being from the northeast and him from the Midwest, we feel starved for green grass, deciduous trees and rustic, wooden fences. The Farm really delivers those wonderful feelings of reconnecting with nature and socializing in an outdoor setting that doesn't feature poured concrete flower beds and overly watered tropical plants. 

For wedding reception/ceremony: We used Mike Kennedy, the nondenominational officiant The Farm recommended for our ceremony, he was excellent. The staff at the Farm as well as Santa Barbara Catering (You must use them to be married here) were outstanding! Our guests said it was the best food they have ever eaten at a wedding, which is a huge compliment. We choose the grove (under the white tent in the pecan grove) for our reception (they have a few other locations to pick from depending on location on the property) and our ceremony was under the large wooden, vine covered arbor - perfection! As wedding prices go, it was definitely reasonable - no idea why the world thinks that in order to have a lovely wedding you need to drop oodles of loot - the Farm is a great option for nature lovers, people missing trees, grass etc, great food, amazing service and a memorable location for their wedding (it was actually less expensive than 90% of the hotel/buffet options out there)

Food: there are three dining options at The Farm, Quiescence (fancy, high end dining) Morning Glory Cafe (breakfast/brunch), The Farm Kitchen - (lunch) I could write a novel here, but overall: the food is a little expensive (lunch is usually $10-$15/person with drinks or if you want desert tack on an additional $3-5 bucks) but it is very good, plus you get the great ambiance of dining under trees on a picnic table or in their little courtyard area. If it's busy prepare to wait awhile to order  and get your food (self serve, you gotta pick it up at the window when they call your number)

 For breakfast/brunch at Morning Glory expect similar pricing, but this is located towards the back of the property in a cozy little brick patio area - simple waiter service."}
{"text":"Don't necessarily come for the food as the ambience is worth the drive. Food can be a little pricy and lack your normal taste but the setup and memories are worth it. If you come for breakfast make sure you come early or be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"My review is mixed as well. I love bringing family here, especially when my child and his friends were younger and played. This old pecan orchard has beautiful grounds, an organic garden, and choice of three restaurants. The Farm Kitchen is my least favorite as it's WAY over priced for essentially a sandwich shop. The food and selection are great, but you do it all yourself. I for one do enjoy grabbing my food and sitting outside enjoying the scenery.  I often come here just to take portraits in the grove. 

The other two restaurants, Morning Glory (which is an awesome brunch place with amazing French toast and other selections) and Quiessence (which is upscale organic fining) are both highly recommended. Many ingredients come from the on site local farm run by Mya."}
{"text":"I often come here for a family breakfast on the weekend or a business meeting during the week. I love the trees and the ambiance."}
{"text":"Everything was AMAZING. The food, location and the service was the best. Perfect end to our Vacation."}
{"text":"Love this place! Best sandwich ever! So fun to walk around the farm and see the gardens where the food is grown. Absolutely beautiful."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed the atmosphere at the Farm. The menu is served cafeteria style so its quick service. My favorite part is finding a seat amongst the pecan tree orchard at a picnic table - makes me feel like Im at a picnic. If you visit at the right time of year - all of the foliage is blooming
A little bit of a drive for me - but when has that ever stopped me!??
Everytime I eat there though - I have not been impressed by the food. The salads ok....the pastries have you salivating while in line but nothing special.
Its too bad because they get the thumbs up on everything else."}
{"text":"Haven't eaten at the farms restaurant. We went on Mothers Day and the menu seemed a bit pricey. 

But, we did shop at the farmers market (bought bread and some produce.) Then we sat down on the picnic tables and had a wonderful brunch eating what we had purchased at the market. 

There is a neat art studio towards the back of the farm. Staff was very friendly and helpful. 

There is a cool chicken coop that the kids can walk up to, the garden is right by the market which is an education tool for teaching our city kids where food comes from.  

This farm inspired my family to put in a large garden and raise 3 chickens in our backyard. 

It is great for an early summer morning outing with the family."}
{"text":"What more can I say about this place that hasn't already been said?  I just wanted to reiterate their amazing location and food!  Their service is fast and friendly as well!  I think it's important to dine at establishments like these because they support our local economy and more importantly, our local food/ecosystems!"}
{"text":"I've been going to the Farm at South Mountain for a few years now. Its been a favorite place for me to take people when I just want to relax and enjoy the beauty of the outdoors. The ambience of this place is quaint and serene. And a tip for the guys, this is THE place to go if you want to impress a lady friend. They'll be so impressed that you picked such a cute and beautiful place. Trust me. ;-)

The food here is nothing spectacular, though you'd never know it from the price. As other reviewers have said, the sandwiches and salads from here are above average in price and just barely above average in taste and flavor. That being said, I think that some of their sandwiches are great ideas and actually have quite fresh ingredients. I love a chicken salad sandwich that actually has chuncks of chicken in it and not just a trace of what could have at one time been chicken. The best part of the meal could possibly be the little baskets that they put your food in. But, like I said, they food isn't bad, but its not spectacular for the price you pay. 

I highly recommend this restaurant that is so much more than a restaurant. From the trees and picnip benches to the little shop in the back to the gardens, this place is an oasis in a hectic city."}
{"text":"I can't tell you enough how much I love this place. I love the scenery, it's like you're not in Phoenix anymore. The farm has three places to eat, I am more of a picnic girl, specifically because I know I can get sweet potato salad and a portobello sandwich and frolick in the grass. Okay, so I don't frolick, but I do sit on a cute bench. Everytime I'm there they have a new soup! It's like a birthday present midweek I swear. The weddings are beautiful there and morning glory is good for company in town."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere with delicious food! Loved the live music and just how beautiful the farm is :) breakfast burrito was to die for"}
{"text":"Farm at South Mountain was a fantastic casual spot for Sunday brunch a sunny spring day. The location is large, open with ample shade from the surrounding trees to cover you from the blazing Arizona sun. Between the two options - Farm Kitchen and Morning Glory Cafe, I chose to eat at the latter. The seasonal omelet, Farm home fries and buttermilk biscuit were average. But I really enjoyed the Farm Monte Cristo, which was a nice combination between sweet and savory. Surprisingly the syrup was not overpowering or too sweet and the brioche French toast was not soggy, even after resting on the syrup. 

After eating at Morning Glory Cafe, I want to return to try Farm Kitchen and Quiessence, both of which are located within walking distance. The Farm at South Mountain is a wonderful outdoor eating location for families and pets but can also be a beautiful venue for a wedding reception.

What I recommend:
- Farm Monte Cristo from Morning Glory Cafe"}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait! The service is slow like the turtles on the premises. I have heard that cock crow five times and still are not served - so hangry! Once the food arrives it was medium warm and it was decent eats. The omelets are only two eggs, so ask for a third. Once served it is pretty good eats and a great place for a date or to take kids to wear them out."}
{"text":"A really charming feature of the Phoenix Metro area is the Farm at South Mountain.  Located  a couple miles north of South Mountain, it truly brings out that Midwestern nostalgia that has a very simple comforting feel to it.  

Our destination at the Farm was Morning Glory Cafe.  With all outdoor seating you would expect it to get a little toasty, but the its completely covered by gorgeous trees that not only shade, but provide a picturesque surrounding.  

The food is all grown on site and the quality was great.  I had the Italian Omelet with mushrooms, cheese covered with marinara sauce.  It was delicious and the perfect size serving.  

Theres so much I didnt get to explore on site, but for breakfast, I can't think of many better places.  Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"1st and only visit. My boyfriend and I went on 02/05/17. Nice and beautiful surrounding. We called ahead and was told the wait was about 30 minutes. Got there before 10:00 am (can't recall exact time) Waited 45 minutes close to an hour. While talking and enjoying the view my guy notice not to long later that there was an open table. Names were being called, but they never once sat anyone at this table. I was starting to get a little impatient because this wait was longer than what was told to us, but I let it go because we were enjoying being outside together. We were called to be seated and would you believe we were seated at the exact same table that my boyfriend notice was empty the whole time we were waiting. So we get seated and it still took the waitress about another 15 minutes or so to come take our order and by now I'm really annoyed, but still being as patient as I can be because by now I'm starving. So we order our food and when it brought out she drops it off and leaves with asking if there anything further she could do for us. We prepare to eat only to realize that we have no silverware. We had to flag another waitress down to get silverware. We flagged down the bus boy because he was the only person we seen to asked for condiments and this time that we're requesting these things our waitress never once came back once to check on us. She finally came with the condiments we asked the bus boy for, but by then it was to late because we had finished eating. We were waiting to pay our bill when a gentleman walked up to check out at the next register. He said to the cashier \"I would like to pay for my drink\" the cashier said \"sir you don't have to pay right now we'll add it to your bill, and gentleman said \"that's ok my family and I will not be staying this wait is to long\". Now if I can remind you readers this is almost 2 hrs after us because it going on 12 pm. So I paid for our meal and my boyfriend asked \"are you going to leave a tip\" and I said hell no!!! The service was horrible and I will not pay someone for not doing their job!!! So we leave and as soon as we got in the car (I swear I cannot make this up folks) a woman approaches my window and said \"hi I'm (don't recall her name) the manage and I notice that you did not leave a tip and I would just like to know why, was something wrong\"??? I looked at this lady standing at my car door and told myself to keep a cool and I said.... yes there were a few problems, we waited longer than the time that was provided to us, when we got our food we didn't have any silverware to eat with had to flag down a different waitress for that, we had to asked the bus boy for condiments, our waitress brought the condiment to us, but it was to late because we were finished eating, the food was good but the service was horrible. She said \"I apologize about that and I will be talking to her and thank you for coming\". I closed my door confused as all out. I turned and looked my guy and said don't you pick another restaurant without reading the reviews 1st!!! Moral of this story is because of that bad experience we will not be going back!!!"}
{"text":"this review is for the morning glory cafe met friends this morning for breakfast parked right after entering enjoyed a nice walk to morning glory restaurant casual dining all outdoors I had white truffle scramble w/lots of fresh vegies and a side order sausage, tasted fine my only complaint was that the food was barley warm my wife had a omlet with the same complaint we did not say anything and our friends did not mention it but my guess is the food was probley the same. service was good and setting was nice"}
{"text":"I've dined at both the Morning Glory Cafe and and Farm Kitchen. I'm definitely a fan of both. Most recently I came here with some co workers and ordered their Chicken BLTDA, which consists of savory thick bacon, lettuce, tomato, dates and apples. The combination of flavors is SO good!. I also got their hearty Jamaican Bean soup.  It was loaded with  meat and potatoes. It's practically a meal in itself. We decided to sit under the beautiful pecan trees, take in the scenery and forget about work for an hour.  Also if you get a chance to go to Morning Glory, you have to try their take on Monti Cristo! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Always come here for lunch except in the summer when they are closed. I mean, at over 100 degrees F, it gets hot on a farm! You can always find fresh food at the Farm Kitchen and its a great atmosphere for lunch. Does not feel like you are in Phoenix! There is a cute sitting area outside the kitchen and a bunch of picnic tables throughout the grounds. Tons of greenery and beautiful landscape you don't normally see in the Phoenix area. It is great to come over here on a weekend with a blanket and have a picnic out on the grass. If you need to relax and rewind, I highly recommended checking this place out - you won't regret it!

Sandwiches are great (Chicken BLTDA) and so are salads, they are pre-made and sit on ice at the Kitchen. Morning Glory has great reviews for breakfast/lunch and I have yet to make it over there. And as of now, I still have Quiessence bookmarked on my list ready to try!"}
{"text":"This is a very friendly place with fantastic food. It is so nice to sit in the pecan grove and have a relaxing lunch. Get the pecan pie, its the best ever.

Food is fantastic! Fun environment."}
{"text":"One of my favorite weekend lunch places. Their chicken BLTDA is amazing and the outside seating is peaceful.  They have one hot sand which with pulled pork that my hubby loves because it is loaded with tons of neat. They have delicious desserts including cookies and homemade pie. Your lunch is served in a basket and there are picnic tables for you to eat. You can even take a blanket and sit in the grass. There is breakfast place and dinner place we have yet to try. Would definitely recommend this place. And an added bonus Is it is dog friendly."}
{"text":"Hello,
And I hope this review does exactly what I intend for it to do. Get the principals of this joke for a restaurant,  who ever they are,  to read it and wake up. Obviously they must be eating the dog food they have been fed by others who rave about this place.

Let's start at the beginning, went for lunch, walked in, saw people at tables so waited to see if an employee would be directing us. NOPE!! nothing of the sorts, walked up to an outdoor menu over a entrance, again what do I do next? People inside look at you but don't ask to help you. We had our dog with us, so I asked my girlfriend to go in and see what she can find out. She walked to the counter and again no one would help. Can I order? Then a person replied and pointed \"you start down there\" Okay great, were getting somewhere. She placed an order for a salad (pre-made crushed into a small container) a chicken salad sandwich and a lemonade. she came out and handed me the salad and drinks and said ' let's find a table, I have to go over to another area to wait for the sandwich\" 

 I sat down at a table with our dog outdoors next to  32nd street (This is a farm?) and she went to get the sandwich.  OH the daymare has just started. After about 20 minutes, she sent me a text and said,\" I haven't left you, still waiting\" This is Chicken Salad People!!! slap it on the bread add some lettuce and tomatoes and it's ready to go. Here's where it gets really good, several people who arrived after us are getting their food from the mystery window by the red umbrella. My girlfriend has now been standing there 30 minutes waiting, she taps on the window and asks \" is there a problem with the chicken salad.\"  \"I'll check\"  the window closes and 10 minutes later the window opens revealing the sandwich.  Now I would say this is possibly a one off scenario except right before she received our sandwich another person who had been waiting said he was on 37 minutes, and then another person came up while she was receiving her sandwich and said \"how long does it take to get a tuna sandwich\" he had been waiting 30 minutes.

We eat what I would say is ordinary fresh food, nothing to write home about, and because I found the concept of standing and waiting 40 minutes to get an average sandwich so ridiculous, I stopped back in to express myself and politely said  \"This is our first time here and your service was awful and we will never return\"

Their response, exactly like the whole experience started. NOTHING.

And although we typically know what items cost before we eat anywhere, so initially the price seemed okay but this place is definitely OVERPRICED."}
{"text":"You are really comming here for the picnic tables, grass and trees. It is a great place for my son to walk around see the leaves and play. All of that ambiance comes at a price, which are $10 small sandwiches. The food is supposedly locally sourced and even straight from that farm, however I did not see any tuna swimming around for the tuna sandwich. The egg salad sandwich was good, as egg salad tends to be but not $10 good."}
{"text":"Looking forward to the reopen!  So YUMMY!  Farm to table food!  My home away from home.  It makes you feel like you aren't in AZ anymore.  Cute for a date morning."}
{"text":"My Wife beought me here today for my birthday Brunch. We had bever been before. The staff were amazing and everyone was welcoming to my great dane and my crazy lab. The food was amazing amd now its cooled in down in AZ its lovely to sit outside. We will be back."}
{"text":"Just plain excellent every time!! Love it! Food and setting are fantastic! They do a good job for Arizona!! Probably one of the best breakfast/brunch places in Phoenix! This is one of those spots that actually is good even if you have to wait to get a seat!"}
{"text":"Ok, I have been back a few times since my last review and I must say the food was great, the atmosphere was amazing, and the service was charming.  I take everything back that I said before.  Everything was great!"}
{"text":"A little confusion!  Arrived at The Farm to learn that breakfast IS NOT served on Mondays!  Not sure where that is stated between Yelp and the website. Had a nice very early lunch of a Strawberry Field salad and a Farm Boy Mess sloppy joe that wasn't up to its billing.  Flavor was awesome!  Just a bit weak on quantity."}
{"text":"Wow. I ate the best omlet of my life here. The eggs were so light and fluffy and fresh. The vegetables were crisp and the avocado guac mix inside was to die for. Thank you, Yelp, for guiding me to the ultimate Sunday Funday brunch in Phoenix. I loved that the atmosphere was so casual. You felt like you were in a famiily's back yard (if their back yard was big and beautiful and filled with goodies. I loved that it was dog friendly. What dog wouldn't want to chill on a patio in the fresh air and maybe get a few scraps of bacon. The Bloody Mary was so fresh and had a good kick to it. We also got an order of the Monte Cristo. Woah. Insanely big slice of fluffy french toast w/ syrup, ham and an egg. I want to go back! I am a huge fan!"}
{"text":"\"I would give the location 5 stars and the restaurant 3, so we're at 4 stars overall.
I went with hubski and a couple of friends for a nice weekend picnic. The experience would have been a 5-star one if we had brown-bagged it, but as it was, we purchased food from the quaint little house-converted-to-restaurant. Hubski and I shared a veggie sandwich and a peach pie thing. Tasty, but most definitely overpriced. The iced tea was tasty and refreshing, but still, sharing a meal with a drink each, it should have been less money.
I'll go back for the ambiance. It's definitely kid and dog friendly, but we'll bring a big blanket, some kid toys, a dog or three, and lunch in a brown bag... we'll still buy pastries though.\""}
{"text":"Poor service. 
Waited nearly half an hour for our order to be taken, nothing. 
Looks like it would be a fun place if there was service. The staff at a 7-11 are more attentive.
Overall I was really sad, really wanted to eat here, but couldn't get any service.  The wait staff just stood in a circle and talked with each other. 
We drove all the way down from North of town to come eat here.  Cannot even express how disappointing it was to drive all that way, drive in such a cool looking place, and then get no service."}
{"text":"Awww...this place is really, really cute. 
I was introduced to the Farm when a friend held their wedding reception in the courtyard. It was beautiful and the food was delish. The restaurant is great, but when I took friends here for lunch it wasn't exactly what i had expected. The sandwiches were fairly overpriced for what they were, the drinks were even pricier.  You have to order your food up at the front instead of being waited on and even though it was quite busy, I still found the staff to be aloof and inattentive.
If you're looking for a place to bring mom or to have brunch with girlfriends, the setting alone is enough of a reason to bring them to the Farm...otherwise I would suggest somewhere else if you're looking for a an everyday breakfast or lunch spot."}
{"text":"Love the outdoor seating and the mini escape from the desert! Wish they had year round options. Have been to all three food options on site and enjoyed them all. A bit pricey but good quality."}
{"text":"First off, this place is beautiful. I didn't get to walk around the whole area, but I did learn that the cafe near The back closes at 1. That's where you would go for breakfast, I can't remember the name sadly. I decided to go to The Farm Kitchen to get a sandwich. I got two sandwiches, two small sides of potato salad, and drinks which were in small cups for the whopping cost of $34, before tip. So it's definitely not an inexpensive place to eat, but it's all organic and it's delicious if you're into that sort of thing. I would love to come back again to try their breakfast and to explore some more. Definitely a great place to bring families or to go on a nice date!"}
{"text":"This is bar none our favorite spot in the valley--and one of my favorite restaurants really anywhere. The quaint setting is super conveniently located a quick drive from anywhere, and it transports you to an entirely new world. The menu options are as unique as they are rewarding to the taste buds. The cheese board is to die for, and we have enjoyed literally everything we have tried on each visit. Very romantic, but also very laid back. The staff is fantastic, and the farm to plate setup is simply fantastic. Love every time."}
{"text":"This is the cutest and yummiest place! Came here for a sat afternoon birthday party for my friends kids. It is sosososo cute!  They have double rows of picnic tables, and trees. Then several small places to eat, gardens, (you can buy fresh eggs in diff colors! and other veggies/fruits dep on what is in season). There is a little house with art exhibits. When we went, they were showcasing a local artist, and had an exhibit where you go through close-lines of white linen sheets. Just like the movies. Never did that before. That day, they had fresh bread baked and sold there.  It was so charming, and so cute.  I think there were 2-3 bridal showers and 2 other birthday parties. We had a great time. And the food was sooo good (we had a steak sandwich and fresh lemonade and apple pie.  yummm)"}
{"text":"Great fresh lunch. Yes, pricey, but fresh home grown. We saw workers picking produce from their gardens. Enjoy walking the grounds. Parking is free across the street from the entrance. The Farm looks like a fun place to hold a wedding and reception."}
{"text":"$$$$ for breakfast or for lunch.. prepare to spend around $20.00 there is really no way around it. A meal normally runs around $13.00 and once you factor in a coffee/drink and maybe a fresh baked cookie or dessert.. you definitely end up paying a lot more than you anticipated BUT its worth it. Food is really fresh here, although sometimes their salads feel a little skimpy. I like to come here for the atmosphere, nothing beats a sunday morning spent on the farm eating brunch!"}
{"text":"The overall experience will become something you crave.  Take visitors here, take your dog!  Nestled in a huge pecan grove, with organic garden, just moments from the city, the food is amazing.  You will never forget it.  The place should be named \"The Jolly  Farm,\" because I didn't want to leave.  I woke the dreaming about the chocolate cookie I took to go and ate when i  got home.  FANTASTICAL !!!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful way to have Mothers' Day brunch. Who knew that this place even existed in Phoenix? Well, apparently 1000 other people on this day at least. And no, that was not an exaggeration. A waitress here told me that's how many people they were planning on serving, and I believe her. There were probably 300 people while I was there at the 10AM seating, and despite the parking situation getting a little hairy, the size of this location can more than accommodate that many people comfortably. At no time did I feel crowded, and I never had to yell at the people across my table.

The food was great. Farm fresh fruits and veggies. Local sausages and meats. A cute, but somewhat misguided \"mom-lette\" bar. Fresh pastries and desserts. But what you're really coming for here is the atmosphere. The peppers turning colors, the smell of fresh sunflowers, the succulents greenhouse, the tractor your little one can climb on, the over-sized Jenga, or the 2 corn-hole courts. The large grass plots where several fathers were playing catch with their sons after their hearty meals. This place gives you some pretty good feels on mom's day. 

On an average day, I would have to imagine it gives you good feels too with their patio or to-go breakfasts and lunches. My wife and I were quite enamored with this place and I think we will have to return soon."}
{"text":"Delicious Breakfast I had a Smoked Trout with a citrus spinach salad, house made granola parfait and a fresh oj mimosa, everything was really awesome. The Farm alone is really pretty and feels like we were far far from home. Last week they had Maya's Farm open with some good selection of organic veg. They also had a small farmers market where I bought probably one of the best organic tea from Wisdom Nectar Tea local Phoenix they had some samples and I choose the bedtime relax with ginger lavender yarrow and chamomile all organic for $15 for a 1.75 oz bag ( Not Bad ) taste better than what it sounds. Going back tomorrow Can't Wait"}
{"text":"We absolute LOVE this place, very delicious. You arrive into a small parking lot and head toward the small building where you order your fresh food, mostly from their farm.  Sandwiches and soups, salads and snacks galore. Once placing your order you only have outdoor seating choices. You can mosey out among the pecan trees and choose a picnic table in that area as well. When your food is ready, they call out a number from your receipt. We've brought games and music to extend our time and have some fun. This is a great place to take out of town visitors!!! You can explore the grounds, see where they grow most of the stuff you are eating. Lots of space for kids to run around as well."}
{"text":"Four stars for the food, another cumulative star for the service, making them a solid five.
That was before we checked out.

Minus five for their not having a defibrillator onsite as my heart began missing beats after their informing me how two cups of soup, a half sandwich, a whole sandwich, two iced teas, a cookie and a small slice of bread pudding came to forty-seven bucks.

I must have appeared to the cashier as a mouth-breather and to everyone else in line when I stood there, frozen,vegetatively mumbling;  \"Huh - forty-seven bucks - really - how is that even possible?\"

But it was my turn to pay for lunch, so I couldn't tell them to stuff their forty-seven bucks and walk out due to their location being directly in the middle of BFE, and with nowhere else to eat except desert vegetation, I sucked it up.

Grumpily, I sat there eating lunch, fixating on how I'd just blasted through one fifth of my unemployment check on a half turkey sandwich and a cup of soup the size of a thimble. 

Not going back."}
{"text":"This place is great. A gem inside the city.

My sister took us here as she knew we'd never had a dining experience like this, and it was pretty enjoyable.  Lots of picture-taking settings.

Food is worth the price.  It's straight from the farm, mind you. How many places can say that?  When you have regular places in Chicago that sell sammies at $12-20 a pop, you will value what you get from the Farm.  I had their special that day - a herb roasted chicken sandwich along with some tasty tomato bisque.  Everything tasted very fresh.

Huge area of picnic tables to sit and watch or bring a blanket and sit on the grass.  There is so much to explore with different boutiques, cafes, and shops all over the the lot.  Hope to come back for brunch or breakfast someday."}
{"text":"Very nice ambience, especially in the fall. 
Large, mature trees line long fields with a pretty view of the south mountains. A quaint \"farm\" setting with small gardens and little shops in shabby chic buildings. 

You park across the street in a dirt/rock lot. Once you wander across the street, there is a cute little shack type set up, you walk in, grab your fresh made, plastic packed items. They have fresh and hearty salads with your choice of gourmet dressings, choices of sandwiches on artisan breads, delicious muffins and cake slices, all made right there. There are really cute miniature pies that look great, as well as fresh made lemonades that are really good. 

You get your sandwiches (fresh made) in a little picnic basket, after you pay. Grab a seat in the fenced in garden and enjoy the views and the weather (if it's not too hot out). Many people bring their pups and enjoy a walk around the farm.

I love this place, I love that everything is fresh and it always tastes great!

Prices are very reasonable for the quality of food you are getting."}
{"text":"Took a friend from out of town there hoping for a good lunch but my friend had the worst turkey sandwich ever, bread was so dry he almost choked on it. The turkey dry and tasteless. Guy at counter was rude when asked for a fork. To make matters worse the sandwich was $12. I was embarrassed that my friend had that experience. Also for being an organic restaurant, they did not offer stevia as a sweeter. 
Also it's dangerous to cross the street (32nd) to park. We would have rather eaten at the Corner Bakery."}
{"text":"The nice view of the trees was incredible. The Tuscan sandwich was delish. We celebrated my dad's birthday here and we loved it."}
{"text":"Such a cute lil spot. Felt as though we had left Az for a few hours, the temp was a lil cooler n it was covered in trees which provided shade for a great outdoor lunch. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"First time visiting and I would not recommend it. Good food, but the service was horrible. Felt like I was interrupting their day to be there ordering food. Told her it was my first visit and she didn't even take the time to show me what they had to offer or how their system worked. It was more like talking to a robot. When they handed me the food they didn't ask if there was anything else they could help with, and just kind of shoved it at me. 

The food is good, but don't order a mimosa. The $9 for less than 6 oz of stale wine is not worth it. Save your money. And expect to be treated as a burden. So sad as I had such great expectations from the reviews I received from friends and family. Hopefully they see this review and do some major training with their staff members. This day in age service is everything. If it was better I would have tipped more than the 10% I left."}
{"text":"My spouse and I went to Quiessence last night for an early Valentine's dinner.  The server suggested a vegan dish made by the chef which is not on the menu since we are vegan.  It was a bowl of red lentils with 7 or 8 small pieces of vegetables on top.  All in all it was about 8 bites of food.  When our bill arrived our entrees totaled $72.00.  It was completely ridiculously overpriced.  I shop local farmer's markets and make this exact meal at home for $5.00.  The service was very nice but the price was so over the top that we will never return.  It's disappointing because we looked forward to eating here for quite some time and left feeling like it was a huge rip off."}
{"text":"Really great environment. It tends to be cooler than the rest of the valley by a few degrees. The food is fresh and the staff is super friendly. The only bad thing is the plastic straws- for having so many animals around you would think they would be like the Phoenix zoo and just use paper?? Other than the weird environmental faux pas I highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"While you will pay more for lunch here than most places, I believe it is totally worth it.  The pecan pie alone is worth the drive.  Can't wait for it to cool down again so I can go!  Fresh and local...good combination!"}
{"text":"This place is wayyyy to good to get anything less than a 5 star review. It has it all:
friendly and attentive staff, stunning environment, and beautiful food.

Don't miss this place. It's a real gem.

I've been going here for years. Today we took my daughter there for her 12th birthday. We brought 4 of here closest friends. Once the food arrived the table got quiet; nothing but the sound of eating until every last speck of food was gone.

After that we retreated to the grassy area under the pecan trees fro a game of touch football. 

What a great Saturday morning."}
{"text":"Easter Brunch at The Farm was quite memorable. The Farm itself is beautiful but I was expecting the trees to be in bloom given the season. Parking was hassle free and organized. Upon arrival, our check in went smoothly and we quickly found our assigned table. Once seated we realized there was a stain on the tablecloth from the previous guests. I would have thought the catering group would have taken care of \"sweeps\" before new guests arrived to take care of things like this. We asked our server for a new table cloth and they politely obliged. I wish there would have been enough food readily available to everyone in the buffet-style brunch. It seemed like every other buffet tray was empty or about to become empty, leaving very small portions available to all who were in line, thus having to make a return trip if you wanted to try everything that was offered. The drink station was also lacking in quantity as it had to be refilled often due to the smaller drink dispensers that were being used. I enjoyed the Banana Pecan French Toast the most, It had a delicious and unique flavor. The Easter Bunny was a hit as well as the scavenger hunt made available for the children. I look forward to coming back and checking out the Farmer's Market."}
{"text":"Loved Julia's chicken enchiladas for breakfast. my husband and I were in Phoenix/Sedona/Flagstaff/Grand Canyon for 7 days eating at as many good $ and $$ restaurants as we could. These enchiladas were deemed THE best dish that we had. 

Got there on a Saturday morning at 8:30 am and it was already very busy; luckily we were seated immediately. Nice that there's a farm so close to the city. The only breakfast seating appears to be outside, which I thought was lovely."}
{"text":"Recently had a lunch date here with my sister. Such a great spot to get a sandwich or salad as well as some fresh air during the beautiful weather! Definitely plan to make it there often, especially since close to work!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times and not once have I been disappointed. I highly recommend the enchiladas as they only serve it on the weekends. The trout platter my mother order was tempting! I couldn't help but pick from her plate. I love the rustic environment and that they didn't ruin it with comfort; meaning it's picnic table-like seating, dirt and wood chips everywhere. Tons of places to take family pics (I actually had my pregnancy photo shoot here). I love that my daughter can walk around and play in the grass and get dirty. Always a favorite place of mine"}
{"text":"A favorite spot for lunch on weekends?!?!?! God.  I hate you guys. This restaurant makes me want to move to Tempe!!!!!!!!  Does not compare to ONE, not even ONE sandwich place I can think of in the east bay.  I got the Pecan chicken salad sandwich and Billy got the steak sandwich, hands down, best sandwich this side of the fucking mississippi.  All outdoor seating, so be forewarned, if the weather is not good, you'll have to maybe escape to an air conditioned car somewhere to enjoy your mayo while it's still good.

One thing I just can't understand...  We were steered to this place by two peeps at the Fry's down the street after atleast five minutes of head scratch.  Now wait one goshdern second people!!!  How could you even question the all supreme sandiwch gods when it comes to the caliber of this place????  Please.  If I worked at a Fry's nearby, this place would be my fucking fall back plan in a second.  I'll stop now."}
{"text":"We just ate breakfast here, and it was great.  It *is* Phoenix, and it *is* outdoor dining, so bear that in mind.  I ordered the Monte Cristo French Toast and holy crap was it good!  haha  Seriously, it was really, really good. The coffee was good, and the fresh orange juice was even better.  My wife had a omelette special of the day, and it was decent (according to her). 

The most frustrating part of the meal were the flies, and to be honest, I'm not sure what all steps you can take to get rid of them outside. It didn't make the food any less tasty, and some odd part of me felt like all that waving around might have helped burn off some of those calories. 

The server was very nice, and was honest about things she had tried or had not tried. For example, they had a new \"Brisket Hash\" on the breakfast menu, but since the menu had come out the day before, she hadn't really gotten to try it yet.  Good place.  I'll definitely be back. And if it weren't for those flies, I would have given it a 5 star rating."}
{"text":"Great little gem!  Stopped for lunch.  I enjoyed the Tuscan sandwich and a lemon bar.  Both were fantastic!!  it was $11ish for the sandwich but the portion was large.  I brought home 1/2 the sandwich.   All fresh ingredients.  All sorts of desserts to sweeten your visit.  

The atmosphere was super relaxed and anyone of any age would find it enjoyable.    There are picnic tables under the trees and tables with umbrellas.  

I have always said that I don't mind spending money one something that is quality and super tasty."}
{"text":"When we went here, we didn't realize that it was a real working farm. We just thought that was the name of the restaurant. We went for breakfast at the Morning Glory Cafe. It's all outside seating, self-serve coffee in a laid back atmosphere. The food was excellent. I got the breakfast tacos with eggs (although I would have preferred if they had a tofu option.) My husband got the cowboy breakfast and enjoyed it as well. Portions were large and service was fast. It's a very unique dining experience and I recommend it to all, especially tourists like us."}
{"text":"This is a cute restaurant where you eat outdoors. There aren't really any frills. I enjoyed the sandwich and salad but note this is not subway, they are very pricey sandwiches. For my husband and I two sandwiches, one salad, two drinks and a piece of cake was $45. A little pricey for lunch, outside without a wait staff. But like I said in the beginning it was cute, not sure if it is worth returning... Hob Nob Cafe is more up my alley."}
{"text":"A Sandwich would be the last thing I will say if you ask me what I want to eat. This place changed my opinion. We got the ham and cheese sandwich. I finished half of the sandwich in 5 mins in the car! It was so good! Their pecan pie is out of this world! Food lovers and sandwich lovers, you have to try this place!"}
{"text":"Went here on on Sunday (3/25/18). Maybe I'm just a poor, broke fool but I didn't think it was worth what we paid. $3.50 for literally a PB & J for the kids? That's what they give to the kids at school when they don't have lunch money. $11-$12 per sandwich. The sandwiches were good but nothing I would rave about. The price includes just the sandwich. Want a bottled beverage? That'll be another $4.50. The atmosphere didn't feel like I was getting an experience out of it. It just felt like I was eating outside, I don't know, didn't feel really any different. It would be nice if it had some sort of festivity about it, like Medieval Times, the waitresses dress up, there's a show. I don't know, at least where the lunch side is served, you are kind of far from any farm-like scenery. It could be something worth the price, but currently, it doesn't hold that for me."}
{"text":"My review is specifically for the breakfast restaurant on the farm. Everything about this establishment is average. The food, the service, the ambiance. The best part was the mimosa with a generous pour of sparkling wine and fresh OJ. We were hoping for an upscale brunch based on what we had heard about dinners there. I just didn't realize there are 3 different restaurants for each meal of the day. Next time I will try dinner there and maybe that will be more of what I was expecting."}
{"text":"We had salads and sandwiches and desserts. We all enjoyed everything except the desserts were too sweet. We like that all the fruit and veggies were fresh even the breads were baked fresh. I live in Los Angeles. I'm visiting relatives here. They were referred to the Farm. We will come here again to eat when we're back in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I've been here two times now. It's not entirely worth all the hype, though it's a super cute venue. The farm looks like it's dying and that they definitely DON'T pick from it to use in their dishes. We ate at the lunch spot which was hard for a gluten-free, dairy-free, soy-free eater. There was barely anything we could have. BUT their staff was nice enough about it. The dishes we chose weren't really worth the money and ended up hurting our stomachs.
We went back a second time, mainly for the outdoor movie of How the Grinch Stole Christmas. It was a super cute setup and we decided to eat at the dinner spot beforehand. We got a cheese patter, to indulge, and a butternut squash soup. The cheese board was not that great. It had a lot of gross things to choose from. However, that soup! That was legit and worth going back for. Both made our stomach's hurt but that's probably because we can't eat dairy. The service is mediocre and the prices are steep. I wouldn't recommend this place, but I'm still giving it 3 stars for the ambiance and that soup!"}
{"text":"I gave it a 4 because the sandwich was flavorful. Note that during winter the grass is brown and not the lush green of spring or Summer. A cute place but maybe not worth a long drive, depending on where you are coming from. I have to include that I wasn't a fan of stacking the baskets (which had food in them).  I doubt they are sanitized each time. A simple paper on top of the food would have made that a better appeal."}
{"text":"Seriously everything about this place is perfect other than it's closed for the summer. I will eagerly be counting down the days until it opens again in September. Great place for groups and kids and dogs! I loved the breakfast burrito I got. They mixed some type of beans with the eggs to create this eggy-beany deliciousness. I got some apricot preserves and a butternut squash creme brulee to take home and they didn't even survive one day before I devoured them."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time. I ate breakfast at Morning Glory Cafe today and it was not tasty and was overpriced. The dry, brittle scone was $3, a cup of serve yourself coffee was $2.50, and the \"herbed buttermilk biscuit\" was dense and hockey puck-like - not the soft, buttery kind of biscuit you would expect and could call buttermilk. My friend and I each spent $21 for breakfast, a non-alcoholic drink and a scone - pretty pricey. Sure, the atmosphere is nice but who cares when the food is boring and overpriced?"}
{"text":"I love coming to this spot. A little gem of Phoenix where you can come enjoy good food and enjoy the outdoors. I lThere are a few different spots to eat, lots of open space with large picnic tables. When the weather is nice and cool outside, it's a great spot to come with friends and family. We came here this past Saturday and it was a bit warm to eat outside but not terrible. The food comes out in little baskets and you can sit under the shaded area or dine at one of the picnic tables. They have lots of events that take place here and it's also a great spot for weddings!"}
{"text":"Im a fan of the breakfast at Morning Glory so i tried their lunch. Not bad of course. was it worth the 15 bucks tho? ehhhh not really. I had a chicken sandwhich and a lemonade. I eat here whenever im tired of eating the same ol regular lunch from around the way. This place isnt far and yes it is convenient, but for 15 bucks? Every now and then doesn't hurt. The vibe there was nice and quite. very charming view and nice benches to eat at. definitely recommend this place, gotta try it atleast once."}
{"text":"First time at The Farm it was the perfect weather to go yesterday 05/23/15 because of memorial day it was not packed ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh yes!!!.. What a beautiful place we had breakfast the omelet was delicious it had fresh veggies, goat cheese, tomatoes n onions it had  fresh salsa on top it gave it the perfect touch! You can walk around n enjoy the place"}
{"text":"Ahh yes, The Farm Kitchen at The Farm At South Mountain. I had it bookmarked to try for over a year. Finally got around to doing just that on Sat, May 3rd, 2014. I guess it was a bad omen when the BBQ place I wanted to take friends was already sold out and had been before noon that day.

While they may serve good ingredients they sure do charge a premium for them. I spent just short of $22 (yep, half sandwich, cup of soup, drink and a small dessert, $22) for lunch and that was no tip included.

Why no tip you ask? Well other then having to make the sandwich I ordered and pour the soup into the cup you have to do everything yourself including clean up after yourself. TIPS really means: To Insure Prompt Service. There is no service here. Plus they gave me the wrong sandwich. So they got 50% of my order wrong.

$22 for a self service lunch with baskets and plasticware. The sandwich was good and the soup just ok. This should have been at the very most, $10 to $12. I guess you have to pay for the ambiance of dining outside. Hey, it didn't cost them a dime to erect a building, insure it, air condition it, etc. All of the other expenses which might drive the cost up to $22.

And honestly while it was nice to dine on a rickety old splinter infested wobbly picnic table under a tree, it wasn't like it was a nicely manicured golf course like lawn. I'm not sure why all you people are so WOW about this place. I'm never going back."}
{"text":"We stayed near the airport in Phoenix on a trip to spring training in March, and this restaurant/farm was nearby. There are three different \"eateries\" on the farm premises, from a counter that sells sandwiches & baked goods (the scones are SO good... I got some to go and munched on them all weekend long) to the Morning Glory Cafe, where we sat outside and had a fresh, delicious brunch. The berry/yogurt granola and the breakfast burrito were perfect. There's another, fancier indoors/sit-down restaurant, Quiessence, too.

We walked around the farm grounds afterwards and observed folks at work - they were very friendly and explained what they were doing and what they were growing.

Minus one star primarily b/c I've only been here once -- parking signage was a little confusing, too, and our pleasant walk was somewhat interrupted by drivers that zipped up the main road (possibly others who were confused about parking?) leaving clouds of dust in front of us to walk through. But little matter!"}
{"text":"We've been twice now for Sunday brunch, most recently yesterday when we took my in-laws, and both times have been fabulous. It's amazing that a place so serene and beautiful exists in the middle of a metropolitan area.  Both times we have had to wait, but nothing too long. Yesterday there were some vendors set up outside Morning Glory Cafe, so my inlaws shopped a bit while waiting.

The food is absolutely delicious! I love how they use fresh and seasonal products, which I think makes it even better.  The American breakfast is standard breakfast but enough food to make me full without being stuffed. My husband had the belgian waffle yesterday and let me have a bite...it was awesome. Plus the whipped cream they give you with it is so light and refreshing...needless to say I ate the rest of it when he was done!  My mother-in-law loved her eggs benedict and had to give half to my father-in-law because the portions were so large. My father-in-law had the chicken enchalidas...delicious! Everyone at the table snagged some...the tomatillo sauce was so flavorful.  I love how they give you your own mini champagne bottle for mimosas.  I'm not sure what the final bill was because my father-in-law paid, but the first time we went for brunch, I think it was around $50 for my husband and I with tip.

After eating, make sure to wander around the property. The Artist's Studio and The Cottage are very cute and full of art and jewelry for sale.  We met the artist in residence yesterday and she was super nice. The artists in residence change every so often, so each time you go, you'll likely see something new."}
{"text":"Disappointing.  $12.95 for a sandwich that looks like it came from a grocery store and thats all you get.  Then at checkout they ask for a tip.  Service was from people who acted like they didn't want to be there."}
{"text":"I know I am the only one, but I'm just not a kid guy. I'm mostly a XBox-Call-of-Duty-With-My-Dogs-Around guy or, if I'm in a good mood, a be-around-my-girlfriend-guy. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate those who do have kids -- there are plenty more cocktails than mine that we could stand to pass down in the gene pool -- but I can't relate. So when Jeff and Jocelyn told me they'd be in town Saturday morning and wanted to meet up, I immediately checked my five start Yelp list. Mimosa's here, bloody mary's there -- or maybe just beeline it to the strip club.

\"Helen and Amelia are excited to see Jenny.\" pretty much blew up any plans I would be able to put together. 

Enter: The Farm at South Mountain. Fresh air, green grass, and space for the kids to run around/fall/eat dirt (or whatever they do) while the adults could catch up. There's really nothing else like it in Phoenix. I highly recommend a visit on a cool spring morning."}
{"text":"This is a fun little hidden spot.  The Farm has amazing sandwiches!  My boyfriend got the flank steak sandwich and the meat was fresh and delicious.  I got the turkey sandwich and it tasted like a Thanksgiving dream!  
The location is huge.  We came on a Saturday and it was very busy, but there was plenty of space.  All of the sandwiches are served in baskets so its like a cute little picnic.  The area is beautiful as well.  Next time I am there I will definitely do some more exploring of the grounds.
It would get a five star review, but the prices for the sides and desserts are a little steep.  I got a sweet potato salad which tasted like it was dunked in onion juice.  The cupcake we got was a chooclate gnache which was so thick it made the cupcake crumble.  They were each 4 dollars too (bringing our total for 2 sandwiches, 2 drinks, 1 side and 1 dessert to 40 bucks). 
Overall though this a great little outdoor spot.  I say its a definite \"must visit\" for locals, but I recommend avoiding the sides and bringing your own bottle of water."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is awesome
Tree lined picnic table area.  We brought badmitton set to play, other ppl had frisbeez & footballs.  Leashed dogs are welcome.  Food is very good bu a tad pricey.  
I will definitely be back to spend a sunny day, but ill probably bring my lunch & purchase a drink or dessert only
Quiessence looks like it wld b an amazing place at nite.  We will for sure check that out some evening"}
{"text":"We had a catered lunch for 30 people. I was so embarrassed when they ran out of food! They provided 2 medium sized bowls of salad and 30 half sandwiches plus a tray of desserts, ice tea, water and lemonade. 30 guests showed up. I didn't expect lots of extra food, but at least a couple of extra sandwiches so the last person could at least have a choice! We ordered extra sandwiches when I noticed we were running low, but it took about 45 minutes for 5 sandwiches to arrive (and they charged us for those too) By then, everyone was done eating. I thought for the price ($18pp plus tax AND 20% set up!) It was very disappointing. Over $800. Would never recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Really great bfast and beautiful setting. Great for kids."}
{"text":"We went here for Mother's Day brunch.  Picnic and dine under tents on the lawn type of place.  Great time.  Good people watching.  The beauty of this place is seeing the smiles on everyone's face.  They have plenty of large picnic tables, so if you have a family of 12 no problem.  Where else can you get that kind of seating.  They also have small tables for the smaller families.  The area is nicely kept and there were plenty of staff on hand to make sure everyone had an enjoyable day.  The food was pretty standard brunch buffet but the star of the show was the ambiance.  A set of benches with Happy Mother's Day for picture taking was a nice touch.   Mom is still talking about it."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to the Morning Glory. The scenery was beautiful this morning. Very relaxing place to enjoy starting the day. Staff was very friendly. The food was very good and the portions were large. I would deficiently go back."}
{"text":"The Farm is a perfect place for a romantic picnic, a group, a family, and I imagine even an escape if you want some alone time... the grounds are well kept and beautiful.  Dog friendly also.

The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because they run out of salads that are on the menu if you get there later in the afternoon... (I guess they only make a certain # of salads per day so if you snooze, you lose!)  However, sandwiches are made to order and delicioius...  The iced tea is really good here, and so are all of the deserts.  

Since it's located so close to South Mountain, I recommend going for a hike before and working up an appetite before heading over to the Farm for lunch.

There are picnic tables, or you can bring a blanket.  I went with a group of people last weekend and we brought a football to play catch... we had a blast!  Make sure you call ahead for their hours of operation.  As I recall, they close at 3pm on Sundays and they will kick you out if they have to because I think there is a gate or fence they close as well."}
{"text":"The Farm is a 12-acre organic oasis in the heart of inner-city monotony. Although the admission to the Farm is free, eating and/or shopping here will set you back a few pesos. View the lush gardens and pecan grove, browse for antiques, shop the farmer's market for freshly baked bread and organic vegetables. Foodies can choose from three on-site restaurants at the farm, including sandwiches and scones to die for."}
{"text":"Our wedding here last year was beautiful. The moment we arrived I knew this was the place for us. It reminded me of back home in the Midwest with the trees and grass, and was the perfect outdoor location for our romantic wedding. I wish I'd found it sooner. But we'll look forward to going back to visit for our anniversary. 

After our tour, we had breakfast on the property - fresh eggs and lemonade, sunlight streaming down. What a happy memory!

We also had a laid-back fun rehearsal lunch catered at the picnic tables that was delicious and picturesque."}
{"text":"We've always loved going to the farm for breakfast on the weekends.  There's always a wait, but you couldn't ask for a better place to wait!  We let the kids run around, the dog gets to walk, we stop and chat with Maya over at the farm stand, buy some things to plant in the garden.... pretty much a perfect morning if you ask me! 

It seems though, that the food just isn't what it used to be.  On our most recent visit, my husband's omelette had hardly any cheese in it, the french toast that our girls shared wasn't that great, and the \"apple butter\" it came with wasn't really apple butter.  Maybe it's an east coast thing that people don't know about out here, but apple butter doesn't contain butter at all.  Not in my book.  But, as I was saying, this was just apple-cinnamon flavored butter.  It was tasty, but I thought I would be adding something somewhat nutritious to their french toast when I requested it.  Quite the opposite...  To continue, the gravy for my country fried steak tasted fantastic- peppery and creamy and delicious!  But my eggs were completely undercooked and I had to send them back.  My husband was charged for a coffee he didn't get, and overall I think it was a bit pricey for the quality.  

We'll probably be giving it another chance soon since it's just a great way to spend the morning and so close to the places we like to hike."}
{"text":"One of the best places to go and have Sunday breakfast. The only con is that it can get very crowded and the wait times could be extensive. The food is good and the scenery is beautiful. You also could purchase some food and have a picnic on the grass. It's a must try if you have the opportunity."}
{"text":"Farm to table food.
All salads are bomb (favorite dressing: prickly pear/chipotle vinaigrette).
I always come on a weekday.
Pet friendly. 
Kid friendly. 
Great place to walk around. 
Great for family lunch.
Super cute.

Dislikes: 
You have to park across the road and no proper way to do that bc sides jay walking.
Sometimes food can take more than a few minutes to come out."}
{"text":"I've read the reviews and I liked what I read. I never have the weekends off. My daughter and I both had Sunday off so the first thing that came to my mind was to try the food here. The wait was about 40 minutes which is a good thing. People will only wait if the food is good. I am not a breakfast person but I did enjoy my breakfast at the Glory Cafe. I had the chef seasonal special which was eggs with some really good sauce over it with potatoes. My daughter had the breakfast sandwich. We shared the food so we got to try both. I would go back"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place.  I was introduced to it when a couple of friends of mine got married here.  I am still impressed by it five years later.  There are a few eating options here, a couple of restaurants and a large picnic area.  It's an oasis in the middle of south Phoenix.  The area around it is nice too, the old farming lifestyle all around.  If you weren't around in Phoenix twenty years ago, you can see the type of farming pockets that used to exist in more frequency around the city.  The only thing missing is an orange orchard with the trees painted white at the trunks."}
{"text":"All right, this place holds sentimental value, so forgive the obligatory 5 star review.

The restaurant serves a variety of sandwiches, which are great, and also tiny little pecan pie that I never tried, but are simply adorable. But I am not here to talk about the food, I am here to talk about the ambience of....THE FARM.

In Phoenix, it is hard to get away from the feeling of, \"hey, I live in a desert!\" But during your time at The Farm, you kind of forget that. And that is nice. It looks like, and is, a farm! If you walk a little further beyond the picnic tables and you will visit the giant cabbage patches, pecan groves, and loud roosters and hens. If you aren't up to spending some money, then just bring a blanket and a picnic basket & enjoy the scenery.

And, if perchance, you decided to get married, this is by far the best place in Phoenix to have your ceremony & reception. It's pretty freakin' romantic.

JUST SAYIN'."}
{"text":"Took the family here for brunch and were enchanted by the garden, the shop and the outdoor nature of the place. It was a nice sunny winter day and we wanted to go somewhere different and special, rather than hit an IHOP or Denny's. Well, this is exactly what we got, a great brunch place, beautiful environment to look around in and have a serene meal. Bumped a star because service was a bit lacking on the day we went, however, everything else was wonderful and delicious.  If you are in Phoenix area and want to enjoy a meal al fresco, I highly recommend Farm at South Mountain."}
{"text":"This place is a beautiful outdoor venue. It's nice and green and during the spring when everything is blooming it is the perfect place for a picnic. The restaurant to several different types of fresh brewed iced tea fantastic homemade desserts. Try the pecan pie it is very different than any other type pecan pie ever had. The sandwiches are all great the sides were good. And it's all relatively priced for fantastic farm fresh product they deliver. The service is great and the bathrooms are nice, parking is easy. I recommend you stop in here before it gets too hot in the summer."}
{"text":"Being new to the Phoenix area, I heard about the Farm from friends at work. I've been missing the grass and trees of my east coast hood, so when I saw a groupon for the Farm, I decided to bring the hubby for a Monday lunch date. The Farm was quite a drive from our Arcadia home, but the scenery was beautiful. Since I didn't grow up playing in the desert with cacti, I get giddy when I see mountains and cacti!
Anyway, we parked across the street then proceeded to walk the grounds. I heard that there is a farmers market on the weekend, but since it was a Monday, it was closed. I did walk through their food co op and it was pretty impressive that they grow veggies and fruit onsite. After about an hour, I was ready for lunch, I had the Pecan Chicken Salad Sandwich and hubby, the flank steak sandwich . I saw lots of homemade deserts but settles on the cherry bread pudding. Our sandwichs were on par with any gourmet sandwich shoppe and the cherry bread pudding was average and very small on portion. Even with the groupon (which was worth $20) we still spent an extra $25, so it isn't cheap. Honestly your not really paying just for the food, but the experience of a picnic lunch in a large , lush field. It made for a fun lunch date outside."}
{"text":"Lovely little establishment. Great scenery, but my meal was underwhelming in the flavor department. My companions' food was fantastic though. I'd go back again."}
{"text":"We had a belated Mother's Day brunch here a few weeks back and had a delightful time! We ate outside at the Morning Glory Cafe and both the food and service was on point.  I opted for the Smoked Trout Board and absolutely loved it!  I cannot wait until it opens again (once it starts to cool down after the summer) so I can take hubby as I know he would enjoy it as well!"}
{"text":"I ate here for breakfast and it was fantastic! The monte cristo was delicious and it was really neat having breakfast outside. There was a cute little market by it and some people were setting up to do a yoga class outside."}
{"text":"9 members of my hiking group went to The Farm after a Sunday AM hike. We waited about 30+ mins for a seat (which we expected with our group size) and got seated only after we pointed out that there were empty tables that could be combined for our party. It took the waitress another 30mins to take our orders. The food was very good so no complaints there and I did enjoy the atmosphere. When the bill came, the waitress told us we all had to write what we ordered on the back of the receipt because hey don't split checks and she doesn't know how much to charge each person. Then after we passed around the receipt and wrote our orders, she came back and said we need to add in the 20% gratuity that was in the total to each persons part. This whole payment process took at least an hour, a total headache. I feel like it's totally ridiculous to have the customers do all this work. If they are processing more than one credit card anyway, then what is the issue with splitting the bill from their end before hand. As long as we stayed trying to pay, they could have seated two more parties in our place and continued to make money.  Plus toward the end, the waitress started to get rude.  I would reluctantly return here if someone else wanted to go just because the food was good but NEVER in a group with more than one credit card."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! We went here for our anniversary... the scenery was just beautiful, the atmosphere was whimsical & the food was fantastic! The staff knew of my allergy upon arrival (asked when he made the reservation) & provided me with a list of options to accommodate my allergy. I was brave & tried things I normally wouldn't & I was beyond pleased with every single dish. The staff was very pleasant. I would definitely recommend this establishment for that special occasion."}
{"text":"Delicious food, fabulous venue!!"}
{"text":"Had the tuna sandwich and a cookie. Fresh and delicious! The courtyard seating area was a great place to enjoy it"}
{"text":"this is a very interesting place to go if for no other reason than the setting....but don't do like we did and park in their lot across the street....parking available right by the restaurant........the food is great for breakfast, and the buttermilk biscuits are phenomenal...the young waitress was from White Center, a suburb of Seattle, where I grew up....she did a great job.....recommend this place to anyone....and buy an extra biscuit!!!"}
{"text":"A getaway in Phoenix. You feel like you've left town when you come here for a family picnic in the fall, winter, or spring. The leaves on the trees make it feel like you e gone somewhere else. The food is so good. Salads  are great. Deserts are ridiculously amazing."}
{"text":"I read a lot of reviews before trying the Farm today and was slightly hesitant. However, it looked too cute to resist. 
Upon arrival we were informed that we were at the wrong spot, breakfast is only served at the rear location. We drove down a sweet little road lined with veggies and all sorts of goodness. 
We were told to seat ourselves and get a self service drink. (Coffee, water and lemonade are self serve for $3.50) 
Contrary to the reviews I read, service was not \"bad!\" However, it wasn't the service I would expect at a cute little place like this. 
The waitress was very sweet, confused over the small menu, but sweet. 
My husband ordered the all American - eggs, bacon, biscuit, potatoes. All was delicious and his bacon was amazing. 
Ordered the granola for my girls- fresh fruit, homemade granola and yogurt. Delicious!  Fresh! Fragrant! 
I ordered the burrito w the pulled pork. The pork was way over smoked. Tasted like pure liquid smoke, salad was bland, no veggies and it was supposed to be loaded with them. 

After we ate we explored the farm and my kiddos loved it. 
I would say this place gets a three for ambiance, you're not coming for the food."}
{"text":"We had Easter Brunch at The Farm. Grandmother, Mother, 5 daughters and their husbands, 4 grandchildren (ages 1-4) and 2 sets of the husband's parents. 
It was the perfect setting. Food was awesome. Omelette bar, great sweets and healthy food, too -salads and chicken, etc. Doughnut and ice cream dessert was fantastic plus homemade Peeps!
Easter Bunny was a hit for the kids. After brunch, we walked the grounds. Grandkids loved the chickens. Tractor with the flowers was a perfect photo opportunity. I want to spend every Easter morning at The Farm!"}
{"text":"Arizona's version of NY's Blue Hill at Stone Barns...very lovely grounds with three separate restaurants for your dining pleasure..review of their fine dining restaurant- Quintessence- is in a separate review but I wanted to note how impressed I was with the property. I came at night and it was lit up very nicely and there was a great feeling of serenity as we strolled through the property and took it all in. There was a wedding reception taking place in one area and if I lived in AZ I would definitely have considered getting hitched here."}
{"text":"This location is such a gem, especially during the holidays! I feel like there is so much to do and so many choices of food as well. I did not have anything to eat but I am planning to go hiking in that area and get breakfast there afterwards. Even then, it would be a great place to take the family. There is so much open space for the kids and dogs to roam around, and they have options for games as well!"}
{"text":"Being that this place is on the South Mountain side of Phoenix, near where we were staying, with not one other place around us that YELPers recommended, we knew this would be on our to do list for our trip. The place is not open on Mondays and breakfast has limited hours during the week. There are three separate restaurant/eating areas on the farm. The lunch area is close to 32nd street with a canopy covered area and then lots of picnic tables deeper into the property. Back deep into the property there is a breakfast place, Morning Glory and the dinner restaurant, whose name eludes me right now. We dropped in for breakfast (almost missed it.)

We were able to seat ourselves and chose an umbrella covered table to stay out of the sun. The red and white checkered table cloths were very cute and very gave the whole area a homey feeling. Drinks here are serve yourself and you can just walk up and get what you like. (Try the lemonade/iced tea combo, aka. an Arnold Palmer, yummy. )

The wait staff were very nice and friendly. They asked where we were from and made a little conversation. SG got the French toast and I got a simple egg dish. The setting was gorgeous. I am not sure how it would be on a summer day in Phoenix, but March was perfect, especially with umbrellas to cover from the sun. Our food arrived fairly quickly. My dish was straight forward but good. SG's French toast was to die for. It was homemade bread, very thick and super good. 

The lunch place was absolutely packed. This was a Thursday and the line was really long. Tons of mom's with little kids and people who look like they were on lunch break from work nearby. Food is served in baskets and then you can take it to your table. It seemed to be more like sandwiches and sides. I do not think there are servers, only counter service, and mostly it appeared to be cold foods. We did not get a chance to eat here. 

I have rated this place a 5 because the place is just such a great setting. All of the eating areas seemed to have great setups for groups, families, and couples. A designated room is set up for rental and parties. I think this would be a pretty great place to get married too and have the reception. Ifr only it had been in CA."}
{"text":"Good food, but an estimated 40 minute wait turned into a 90 minute wait. It's just not worth the time invested to get their food. Horrible table management."}
{"text":"Great place to bring family on a Saturday or Sunday.  Lots of shade with picnic tables for you to enjoy the beautiful scenery while eating a good sandwich with organic ingredients.  At the end of the farm you will find the morning glory cafe that offers a great brunch.  Price is medium/high for breakfast but it's worth it.  Once you are all set and done you will spend about $20 per person with tip.  Worth the trip.  People that work there are great too.  I almost forgot to tell you to bring your camera and you best smile as there is a lot of cool spots to take pictures.  If you have kids bring them over and let them run wild in the nice grassy areas and let them check out the chickens and ducks."}
{"text":"Early Saturday Morning, Trying to figure out what to eat, didn't feel like going to Ihop, then turned down 32nd street going north and my friend told me about this place called The Farm. We pulled up the long drive way, past a wedding reception that was getting set up under a huge vine covered canopy. The place took my breath away, large flowers shot from everywhere. We went into the outdoor seating area and were pleasantly surprised--there were lots of young couples, all savoring the last of our beautiful spring weather before it gets too hot. We sat under the Mesquite trees and I had one of the best cups of fresh squeezed orange juice, I then dug in to my favorite--Eggs Benedict, and savored the ever so thinly sliced smoked ham, that it almost tasted like Prusccioto! An elderly woman, was so overtaken by the joy around her that she smiled at me in her cool shades and exclaimed as she sat down, \"oh it looks so good!\" To which I of course replied and confirmed it was the best Benedict I had eaten in a while. Too bad it will be hot soon and I won't be able to sit on that beautiful area....There was a small chicken coup, and a small art studio there with amateur art--still it was nice to walk about in the Pecan trees and feel a little heritage our valley has so quickly traded for cookie-cutters and those awful subdivisions."}
{"text":"During cooler months, this place is fantastic and my family and I are huge fans! Very cute property and lots of grassy area for kids to run around. We'll even bring our dogs here sometimes. It has a patio with shade trees and tables or you can sit out in the fields on a picnic bench or bring a blanket and cop a squat. I've seen cute baby or wedding showers in the field and I understand you can also have a wedding here. 

Food is nice and fresh however it's not cheap. It will likely run you about $30-$40 for 2 people to have lunch, sandwiches and teas or soda and MAYBE  dessert to share. 

If you haven't been here or are in town during winter or spring months, it's a must visit. Really cute place and good food."}
{"text":"The Farm at South Mountain is so very quaint, and doesn't feel like you are in the middle of Phoenix. When I went it was for a self lead venue tour, so I was free to roam the property- and I was most impressed with the succulent green house, the old house that is turned into a shop, the chicken coupes, and the quissisential wedding garden. All were so charming. The farm was my front runner for a long time for my wedding but another venue gave me a better deal. I will always hold a special place in my heart for the farm at south mountain though. :) I can't tell you anything about the food as I have never tried it, only about the location itself."}
{"text":"We had my daughter's 2nd birthday brunch at the Farm at South Mountain.

This place is beautiful during the fall. Breathtaking, actually. 

While it's on the pricey end to host an event here (you must use their catering for events), I think it was well worth it. The food and service was great and the tables that they set up for our birthday party were beautiful. 

The ONLY negative I have about this place is the parking situation. We had someone in a wheelchair, so needed to pull up to the grove area in order to get him out and were  yelled at by a younger guy with long dark hair and a ponytail. I tried to explain to him that we were quickly pulling up to let out our handicapped passenger out of the car, he just yelled that we need to move our car and NOW! He was extremely aggressive and rude. He almost ruined the day with his negative attitude and harshness, so my husband ran over to him to explain what was going on and he said that he didn't have time to explain to every car that they can't pull over on the road because it's a fire hazard. Had he just directed our car to where there was handicapped access and told us in a more humane and kind way that we weren't allowed to pull over on the main road to firetruck access, we would have most definitely followed his directions. Instead he just screamed at us, which shocked me. Not the way to treat paying customers. 

Other than that VERY negative experience, we really enjoyed our time there."}
{"text":"Love it here. Highly recommend and can't wait to go back. They do a lot of cute things, and the food is good."}
{"text":"My favorite part of the Farm at South Mountain is the establishment. It's rustic, quaint, and alfresco. The food is good and they use local and organic when possible, however, the prices are high and the service needs work. Their pastries are outstanding, and baked everyday fresh. It's the perfect place to go for lunch during the week days to get out of the corporate office feel."}
{"text":"I just love the Farm!! Such a beautiful place and scrumptious food options!! 

I would have to say this is one of the best spots to bring people from out of town to see. This is a great spot for a girls brunch or event! Came here with a group of friends and found ourselves sitting and talking for hours! Just a relaxing goof vibe kind of place. 

The restaurant in the very back is the best for breakfast/lunch!!  Great open patio!
It's self serve on the beverages - teas, coffee, lemonade or water. 

I have had the breakfast sandwich and the juevos rancheros and I cannot tell you which one was my favorite because they were both delicious in their own rights. Every menu option looks so good so its difficult to choose. 

Serve is always friendly and attentive!"}
{"text":"By far, one of the best atmospheres for a brunch with friends and family! 

Their own farm fresh foods and enough options to make your decision a tough one! 
Having daily specials is a wonderful way to promote something different for those who are new and regulars as well! 

Also, dogs are encouraged to join the dining experience and they have self serve, water, coffee and fresh made orange juice! (:
The OJ makes the mimosas a must have!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to picnic, bring out of town visitors, bring the dog, even bring some obnoxious children. Just don't bring them all at the same time.

There are so many reviews, I'll just add a few quick things.

The soup and sandwiches are probably the better things on the menu(although the bread can be hard), I agree with the others who said the counter line does not flow well, especially if you need a refill. (bring your own chest of drinks)
I've had several of the desserts and they were absolutely gross, especially the Pecan Pie ( I Make the Best) the blueberry pie used canned blueberry goo= Yuck, not impressed by the bread pudding or carrot cake either, the butternut squash creme brule' was quite tasty though.

Basically it's more about the scenery and having your own picnic, Heck you could even bring your own food if you wanted. In fact you should.

I haven't been to the back of the farm but I understand they have a breakfast restaurant with waiter service and a nice dinner place too, along with a few other shops."}
{"text":"Great place to go on a nice sunny Phoenix day.  Be sure to bring a Frisbee or football to throw around and have one of the delicious soups and sandwiches.  Most locals don't know about this place and I am OK with that since it already gets crowded to the point that I have never been able to walk in and get a seat at the Cafe.  You can easily spend an hour walking around the farm and discovering a bit of Phoenix history."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat Sunday morning. I love the spinach eggs Benedict. It's also dog friendly which is a big bonus! When the weather is cool and perfect the patio is filled with cute adorable friendly dogs. The staff are all nice and attentive. The whole flower garden by Morning Glory automatically puts a smile on your face. Sometimes you even get to make your own bouquet of hand picked flowers and choose a vase. If you're luck they also sell homemade goods and produce straight from the farm. I also love how this is a wedding venue as well. I hope one day I can have my wedding here! The area is so romantic and lovely."}
{"text":"The Farm has never, ever disappointed. With it being officially Fall in Phoenix, the weather was perfect for a picnic lunch. 

I had the Grilled Chicken Spinach Salad. It had grilled chicken, spiced pecans, dried cranberries, goat cheese, tomatoes and spinach served with creamy Farm house dressing. The goat cheese gave it an extra wonderful kick. 

Fantastic! Fresh and delicious! The best part was a side of their Roasted Sweet Potato Salad. It had pecans, chives and some sort if chili spice. Excellent contrast to the sweetness. Okay, I lie...the best part of the meal was the Apple Turnover I bought and brought home. That WAS the absolute best! Great stuff!"}
{"text":"We had high expectations based on the Yelp reviews, but was disappointed on the overall conditions of the grounds around the two restaurants and the Maya farm.  The Maya firm was an actual pit, with weeds, mud, and huts in shambles. The chicken coop was in poor shape w/animals drinking out of green water. The Morning Glory cafe was good...great attentive service and the food was excellent. But, the amount of flies made it unbearable to eat, and sitting on those white plastic chairs wasn't that cool.  And, the grounds were just run down and really not ready for the public. A real gold mine, if the owners would invest in updating and cleaning up their property. Hopefully, they will."}
{"text":"Very cute and fun atmosphere. Definitely good for a relaxing change of pace. Although the ambiance is great and there's so much to do and see, the food and service is another story. We went on a Sunday morning for breakfast as a group of 6. I had the best breakfast sandwhich meal, mimosa, and coffee. The coffee was average and the mimosa very dry and tart. As for the food, the potatoes where a bit greasy and didn't have a good fluff and crisp to them. My sandwhich was good, but there was nothing exceptional to it. For the expectation and price I was expecting something a little more worth my while.
I will say some of the other dishes were a little bit worth it like the French toast and black ham omelet.
Service was also fair. Our waitress was super nice but took forever to get to our table to rage our order,  check on us,  give the check,  and check us out."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden treasure.  3 different restaurants on the same grounds, all hidden away from the rest of South Phoenix.    Good food, good service, outdoor seating, beautiful grounds to stroll around on, plenty of parking, a cute little vegetable garden, a country store and much more."}
{"text":"Really nice place love it it feels like you are far away from downtown"}
{"text":"A nice place to have a sandwich and enjoy the open space!. Good to brunch in a big group. I still haven't try the morning glory cafe, but soups and sandwiches feel FRESH!"}
{"text":"This place is just completely and utterly charming. I went with some old friends for lunch and we sat outside at the picnic tables under an umbrella and had a great time. The food was delicious and fresh (sandwiches, salads, fruit) and the ambiance with the trees, gardens and birds chirping nearby was just enchanting. It's like an oasis in the middle of the desert."}
{"text":"Location, location, location = atmosphere, atmosphere atmosphere! The farm setting is the best thing about The Farm at South Mountain. I would come here every day and hang out for hours if I could.

The food is seriously good too. So fresh, flavorful and delicious with local organic ingredients, often fresh-picked on the premises whenever possible. I've had breakfast at the morning glory cafe with fresh eggs and vegetables gathered from the farm, and I had a picnic lunch from the take-out window, a juicy portobello mushroom sandwich with marinated garden tomato. Seriously the first time in Arizona that I enjoyed the tomato, cause I'm so spoiled for garden heirloom tomatoes, and usually you get served tasteless, mushy supermarket varieties.

You can take a stroll around the grounds before or after lunch, browse the cute shops with locally-hand-made goods, foods and crafts, cluck at the chickens and ducks even take home fresh eggs, veggies and plants for your own garden.

The overall atmosphere creates an experience that is memorable and beautiful, a special treat to remind us of a simple and good way of life."}
{"text":"This was a cool little restaurant with a great option to eat out under the trees. I loved their soup!"}
{"text":"What a beautiful setting! This is the perfect place to get brunch in a quaint farm atmosphere. You start by walking down a lane that gives you the feel of walking into a little paradise. There was only a short wait and we got to walk around and see the farm and chicken coop in the meantime. So fun! The food was very tasty and the service prompt. Self serve drinks helps keep the flow nice. This was a perfect place for our first stop in a Phoenix!"}
{"text":"This is a unique dining experience.  I come to Phoenix a couple times a year and this is far, the best breakfast in Phoenix.  Very casual, relaxing and super food that is fresh and natural."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to try this place during our visit to Phoenix for Spring Training. Wow! Driving into this place you forget that you are in the desert. We arrived a little before 9am on a Sunday and were happy we did because by 9am every table was filled and people were pulling in pretty quickly. 

After we were seated the waitress said the coffee and water was self serve which I thought was pretty convenient. Everything on the menu looked delicious, so I was really torn about what to order. I ended up ordering the farm burrito and I was happy I did. The burrito was filled with scrambled eggs, tepary fried beans, cotija cheese and chorizo wrapped in a flour tortilla, it was fabulous. The burrito came with a side of home fries and just to warn everyone the portions are huge. I ended up only earring half of the burrito. My boyfriend ordered the farm omelette which is a popular item on the menu. Filled with fresh vegetables and a side of home fries let's just say he cleaned his plate. 

The ambience was great and the views were fabulous. As we were leaving we noted that this will definitely be a go to place whenever we come back to Phoenix. Such a gem of a find."}
{"text":"Had breakfast there again today with my husband. We go there around 9 am, surprisingly no wait.  I had the special heart healthy omelet with goat cheese, mushrooms, spinach, tomato & onions wrapped in a delicate pocket of egg whites.  I love the biscuits and honey.  We had two super delish Bloody Mary's.  The weather was perfect for dining outside at the Morning Glory Cafe and service was excellent.  Our green shirted gal was prompt and quick witted to combat my sarcasm.
If you live in PHX and you have not been you should go.  If you plan to visit from out of town and are looking for a casual outdoor dining experience this winter, no snow, just sweet sunshine here.  The menu has a variety for meet lovers, and healthy eaters. I really treasure this place, it is like an oasis in the desert."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Went for lunch and couldn't ask for a better setting.  Food was just ok. Not nearly what we were hoping for. I had an old fashioned turkey sandwich that was short on turkey and too long on aioli and cranberry.  Cranberry jelly was too sweet and drowned out what turkey was there."}
{"text":"For our monthly ladies luncheon we wanted to try something outdoors before it was too warm to enjoy. The Farm was a perfect choice. We ordered our food, it came in a picnic basket and we choose our spot to eat underneath the trees. 

The food selection was freshly made salads, fruit, or you could pick a sandwich made on several different choices of bread. Now the baked items all looked delicious. It was hard to choose. I ended up choosing the pecan chicken salad sandwich on a fresh baguette with potato salad and fresh lemonade. For dessert butternut squash Creme brûlée. It was a little pricey but well worth it. I loved everything. 

I would definitely recommend this place during the Fall and Spring seasons. Beautiful!"}
{"text":"This place gets 5 stars for uniqueness and character. I've been here several times over the years and it's always lovely in the spring and the fall. The food is above average and fresh. Unfortunately, they get a 3 on service. The staff is downright rude and snippy when you ask them questions. Everything is self service and it's as if they don't want to be bothered.  Note to the business manager: please update your listing. It says you close at 4pm on Saturdays, but it's really 3pm.  We saw many people come to the door at 3:15 and they were locked. By 3:20, staff was turning the chairs upside down so we would get the hint. When I mentioned it to a staff member that the closing time on Yelp was incorrect he mumbled \"yah, we get that a lot\"."}
{"text":"The Farm at South Mountain was the recent cite of a Mom playdate my friend and I scheduled when it happened that both of our moms were in town over the same weekend.  

We went to the breakfast place, which worked out well because I probably would have lost my mom to baby fever if we'd gone to the lunch spot, as there were several tables of baby shower celebrations set up there.  

I thought the food was alright, but not great.  I loved the fruit salad that my mom ordered and thought that the mint syrup was an innovative touch that really classed up a pretty standard assortment of melon.  The egg burrito thing I ordered was on the rubbery side.  I'd definitely go again.  If only for the mini bottles of champagne.   It is nice to sit outside and look at all the flowers and eaves drop on the young couples and watch all the baby shower guests cart huge gift bags from the parking lot across the street to gingham covered tables under the shade trees.  

I hope Del Web or some other super developer doesn't purchase all the surrounding land and totally ruin the illusion or originality and quaintness created by a brunch at the Farm."}
{"text":"This is a great place to take out-of-town visitors.  Just be prepared to take a nap afterward...all of the fresh air, beautiful scenery and delicious food makes you sleepy!  The ambiance is unique; it's all outdoor seating at picnic tables under pecan trees.  Your meal is served in a basket and the food is very tasty.  You can buy fresh vegetables, unique gifts or go for a stroll through a botanical garden.  I highly recommend dining at The Farm at South Mountain!"}
{"text":"The is a hidden gem! You would never imagine such a pretty spot in the middle of Phoenix. Very beautiful area. The food was delicious, seasonal, organic and beautifully presented. A lot of trees and flowers, there's picnic tables under shade trees. Very beautiful place for pictures. I believe I read on the website, you must ask permission for professional pictures taken on their property and to bring in outside food for the picnic area. They have lights at night that make the area a beautifully romantic place for dinner or an event or wedding. Love it here!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness. The food here is amazing. Simply amazing. I have had the pleasure of ordering food to-go here three times and staying for lunch once. Each time it does not disappoint. 

The restaurant is out doors and quite quaint. You order your drinks inside and they serve it for you, which can be a pain for people like me who re-fill about 4-5 times, you have to go back inside and wait in line to have someone serve you. The serve your order in a cute basket and you have to find your own seating. 

Every time I have gone I've ordered the Old Fashioned Turkey Sandwich, although it costs almost $11.00, it's worth it! I don't go as often as I'd like because I can't justify buying an $11.00 sandwich so often but the times I do go I don't regret it. 

Parking is limited so if you don't find parking directly in front of the restaurant then park on the opposite side of 32nd street. Don't waste your time driving through the long road past the restaurant, parking is too far and the multiple speed bumps are annoying. 

Each time I have gone the service has been just fine."}
{"text":"Very \"neat\" place.  My neighbor/friend Melissa works there ... she's a cute little neo-hippy and an obsessive organic farmer. So I assure you that the food is locally grown and organic.  

She a vegan and sometimes she has to chase chickens (that cracks me up).

Nothing here is deep fried or drenched in grease, so it's not really my kinda place.  Then again I'm certainly not your typical diner.  No doubt, NORMAL people would LOVE this place"}
{"text":"Great food! Nice setting and a really cool waitress !! The orange juice was so good, fresh! They also had (free) complimentary lemonade, coffee and tea for any one that would like to help them selves l. An I got huevos rancheros !! I asked for my eggs to be well done and they came on a crunchy tostada with a side of beans and seasoned potatoes with bell peppers! It was very delicious !!"}
{"text":"It's a really nice place to visit and has great food. The food is always very fresh and the couple of times I've been there the device was exceptional. I'd recommend trying it at least once since it's a different kind of experience than anywhere else in Phoenix."}
{"text":"We brought out of town guests. All of us loved it. Peaceful, quaint, and the food was very excellent.We will be back."}
{"text":"One of the most relaxing places that's within biking distance from my house. I, am indeed, one lucky gal! 

While it's not huge, the farm can keep me occupied for hours on end. I just love the serenity and beauty of it all, and taking time to breathe deeply and enjoy the little things in life. 

The Maya Farm apparently has amazing CSA shares I am going to buy into shortly that include flowers. I buy myself flowers every week, so this is a super fantastic deal :)

The little art shops and gardens are just beautiful and everyone is so nice and kind. I spent quite a bit of my stay there today playing with an adorable boston terrier. 

Downfall is the lack of good places I felt safe parking my bike. Bonus is I just brought it with me (consider it my dog) wherever I traveled. 

I will be back here... again.. and again.. it's a great weekend morning trip. I took some fantabulous photos today."}
{"text":"What an incredibly beautiful place this was to have our Mother's Day brunch.  Melissa (my sister-in-law), if you are reading this, this idea was amazing!  I vote we go here again next year...thought I'm sure I will be back before then.

We drove up Mother's Day, saw all the cars, and immediately thought, \"well, this is gonna be a crowded mess\".  We were wrong.  Parking was valet which was nice, but we walked over to The Farm and were astonished.  It didn't even feel like Phoenix.  It felt like going somewhere green and lush...where real weather occurs and the plants are not all equipped with poison and/or spines.

I can only attest to Mother's Day so far, but it was amazing.  The food was delicious; tomato salad with mozzarella and basil, fruit salad with mint, asparagus and mushroom quiche, french toast with candied pecans, bananas and a carmel drizzle, \"mom\"-lettes...all of it was delicious.

There were dads playing catch with their children, beautiful pathways through the plants growing, a tractor for the children to play on...and there were plenty of umbrellas to keep the shade up and the heat down.

We found out that they serve box lunches, and I absolutely intend to be back to try their menu and to spend my day in their fields, under their trees, walking through their gardens."}
{"text":"The food and ambiance are incredible! The miso corn soup was tantalizing to the taste buds! The service was a little slow at times but not enough to get terribly upset about."}
{"text":"Totally can not talk crap about this place. There was no line today at all, food is very tasty and fresh, service is nice. Quite interesting experience if you have not been there and absolutely worth checking out.

Not 5 starts for price and upkeep - i feel both cold be somewhat better.

\"I like\"

Eugene"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to stop by for a couple years and finally had the chance! It did not disappoint! We went to the morning glory cafe for breakfast (really want to try lunch!). I had the huevos rancheros and loved them. My kiddos loved walking around the farm while we were waiting for our food.  They saw chickens and farmers at work planting. They loved it! The Farm is closed during the summer so be sure to check online if you're trying to go."}
{"text":"An excellent little place to have a picnic lunch!  Prices are a bit high, but the atmosphere and use of local products for the food is great!  We will be back."}
{"text":"seriously, this is the best place in arizona for breakfast. you can't beat the great outdoor seating, fun little market shopping and the mimosas and bloody marys! what makes this place pretty special is that they grow a lot of the veggies right on property."}
{"text":"Boys, take your ladies here! You can thank me later.
Eating breakfast here was hands down my favorite thing I did in Arizona.
I came on a Sunday morning, and just the drive to the eating area was so refreshing. To be eating a bomb breakfast on a farm with live music and being helped by such a wonderful staff too, I can't imagine a better way to start off my Sunday!"}
{"text":"Nice place for families and kids. Ordered a special sandwich and did not particuarily enjoy it but the atmosphere was nice and enjoyable."}
{"text":"Having never been here we received a recommendation to try it, so we booked Easter Brunch, WHAT A MISTAKE!! Sitting outside is cool, waiting 15 minutes to get your own water, ice tea or lemonade NOT! Buffet included nothing, no soda, cash bar and for $50.00 each the food was low quality. The Strawberry salad was wilted and warm, eggs were runny and looked like they had gone through a blender 1st, bacon was swimming in its own fat, GROSS!! The advertised a carving station but it was only HAM, already carved and placed in a tray? Seriously for $50.00 a person  a carving station should have more that Ham, the Chicken in a lemon sauce was not cooked all the way through many pieces were pink. Couldn't get a soda or something else to drink unless you waited in line. No waiter or waitress service. We all had one plate and left.
If going here for a dinner it may be good but for the Easter Brunch I'd rather have gone to IHOP!"}
{"text":"YUM!

There's not much which hasn't already been said.  I had brunch/breakfast with my fiance, a friend, and an out of towner with his friend.  We had breakfast at the Morning Glory Cafe and it was delicious!  Three of us had mimosas (Thanks Kristin for the tip on those - they were delicious and too cute with the individual bottles) and the serve yourself beverage bar was convenient.  I had french toast with a side of potatoes and my fiance had the monte cristo with a side of bacon.  I would recommend both entrees.  We both ate all of our food (which was a lot) and didn't feel overly full, which was nice.  The potatoes were delicious and the bacon was so-so.  You would think for $2.50 you would get 3-4 thick, juicy slices of bacon.  Instead, you get 2 kinda puny, nothing-to-write-home-about strips.

The atmosphere is fun and earthy.  Too bad it was overcast and a little chilly.  Otherwise, it would have been perfect.  It's a nice setting in the midst of \"the farm\" complete with veggies growing and chickens in the coop (beware of the smell folks if you wander in that direction).  There are also other vendors selling art, jewelery, and other pieces.  My favorite was watching the man selling bread.  He seemed like the nicest man and was so happy to pair a person with the perfect loaf.  My fiance didn't get that from watching him, but I could tell.  We went over to buy some bread and he was in fact one of the most genuinely jolly people I've met - and I don't use the word \"jolly\" very often, but it fits him perfectly.  He had us smell the asiago loaf, introduced us to the jalapeno Cheddar, and finally sold us on the rosemary with sea salt.  It was $7, which I would normally think is ridiculous, but for as often as I'll probably make it out here, I bet I'll buy a loaf from him every time if he's around.  The happy bread guy is worth the last star for me."}
{"text":"Amazing!! It's a beautiful place and the food is to die for. Also the staff are the best kinds of people! Everyone is so down to earth, kind, and funny! Great experience!"}
{"text":"Great, great, great! Relaxing, classy, excellent food. I had no idea such a place existed in Phoenix. A real gem!"}
{"text":"Beautiful place to spend the day; and start early! We had a delicious breakfast and look forward to a picnic lunch in the future!"}
{"text":"Morning Glory offers great French toast http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8rlTOw0IA1TENURMBJpaXw?select=-4feMjhfMVa68yPeJJeZ1Q#-4feMjhfMVa68yPeJJeZ1Q and good omelettes.  The Farm Kitchen sells great sandwiches and a few tasty pastry selections.  Side salads are pricy considering the size portions.  Haven't had a chance to dine at Quiessence, yet, but I've read great reviews.

BTW, one can also get massages here at The Retreat!  I've never been, but there is a sign that says \"by appointment only.\"  There used to be a giftshop where one can buy natural beauty and skin products, but that's long gone (I used to get e-newsletters).  Those products used to be sold at a location next to the vegetarian/vegan restaurant that used to be on Goldman and 5th in Scottsdale, but that also closed a year or two ago..."}
{"text":"The Morning Glory Cafe is absolutely gorgeous.  The food portions filled me up halfway through."}
{"text":"Beautiful, clean, relaxing, amazing. My favorite place in the valley. 

I eat the Tuscan Chicken sandwich every time I come here and I eat nothing else.  If you need it to be quick, call in your order for pickup, i've had great luck with that. :)"}
{"text":"It's so nice to stroll around this old pecan farm. You really feel like you're in the rural country side. I love the garden, the towering trees, the shade. It's lovely. 
Best chocolate cake I've ever had is from here. And amazing soup and sandwiches. A little more on the pricier side, but worth it. 
I've been a couple times and have never had a bad experience with service. It's too bad they shut down in the summer. I understand during the day, but in the evening this place would be delightful to have dinner."}
{"text":"I would go for the ambiance but skip the meal. I've been here a handful of times & am always very hopeful that I'll like the food, but it consistently comes up short for me. The bread on my sandwich was tasteless & didn't seem fresh. I love that they grow so many of their own ingredients & would still go there to support them, but maybe stick to a beverage. I've also heard of people using the grounds as a wedding venue which I imagine would be absolutely magical."}
{"text":"The Farm at South Mountain is beautiful and a real gem of the Valley.
But the restaurants are FAR to expensive to even bother trying the food!
A sandwich at the Farm Kitchen can cost you no less than $10!! And that is all you get for the price-a sandwich, not even a pickle on the side!

The small treats, like bars, muffins, etc. are expensive as well.

So...to really enjoy the beautiful landscape, pack a picnic and walk around the property. They have a beautiful shaded picnic table area, large garden, and artists' cottages. 

It really is a great place to experience actual greenery and you can make your time there even better by preparing a picnic to enjoy!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Food is incredible, place is beautiful. One of my favorite spots in all of Arizona. This place is literally a farm with gardens, grassy areas and tables to picnic, several cafes and restaurants which cook with all of the food grown on site. Romantic and probably the best date idea ever to spend an afternoon or evening here! We went to The Farm Kitchen which is one of the cafes on site. There's a walk up counter and they offer sandwiches, soups, salads and a bunch of homemade baked goods. 

We ordered the Pecan Chicken Salad Sandwich and the Farm Garden Sandwich. Best chicken salad to ever exist and all of the ingredients are fresher than anything I've ever tasted! We got one of the fresh baked bread puddings for dessert and it was so delicious we went back and bought another one to bring cross country on the plane to enjoy at home! Seriously- THAT GOOD. Another plus? They're kid and dog friendly so you can bring the whole family if you like! This place is a must see and must experience if you are in Arizona! Incredible!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since they first opened. Working half a mile away doesn't hurt, though I have driven from home just to enjoy a nice Saturday lunch in the Pecan Grove.
     The sandwiches here are flavorful and inviting. They have a unique variety that's hard to find the likes of anywhere else in the valley.
     They also have a nice sampling of salads and side dishes.
     The best part of eating here are the sweets. They are different types from pies, cakes and cookies they will bring you back after eating just one. My favorites are the Oatmeal Raisin and the Chocolate Cherry Walnut. I could name other wonderful treats but there are so many.
     They have a nice variety of sodas and they now serve beer.
     If your wanting a nice family lunch treat and a place to let the toddlers and little ones run around outside, this can be the spot for you. Relax at a picnic table and watch the little ones wear themselves out after lunch.
     As a heads up it's not the cheapest food around but you get what you pay for. Delicious Healthy Food!"}
{"text":"I am not a breakfast person at all. So for me to be raving about breakfast is a funny. My sister took me here cause they loved it. It is by far the best place in Phoenix to have breakfast. The biscuits and gravy was out of this world and the cinnamon french toast was heavenly. It's a little hard to find. Once you find the farm you have to travel down the long dirt driveway to get to the cafe (to find no parking). Just park out front and take the nice walk through the beautiful farm on the way in. It's worth it!"}
{"text":"Had taken my mother here before it is always a nice time enjoy the atmosphere. Great food good people friendly establishment."}
{"text":"Spent our morning hiking South Mountain and have been wanting any reason to try this place out. We loved it! Got the turkey sandwich, roasted chicken sandwich, chili, lemonade and a PB&J sandwich for the kids. We all thought everything was delicious! And refills are free. Heeeeeeeey   the service was great. The oatmeal cookie I snuck in last minute was so yummy. And it was really nice to walk around and explore. For a second there my husband and I thought we were legit photographers taking adorable pics of our kids."}
{"text":"A picturesque locale with good sandwiches and beverages. Since the seating is outdoors, this does limit the times when I feel like coming here, since your enjoyment level of eating here will partially depend on the weather."}
{"text":"We went to the Mother's Day brunch this year. Scheduled it as the first group of seatings. Service was fantastic and it was not crowded. Food was delicious. Will definitely do MDB here again, booking at the same first seating time."}
{"text":"Great ambience all natural with good and healthy food. I tried roasted carrots and feta sandwich along with black bean soup it was good. My beau tried Tuscan sandwich and that was highlight it was really good."}
{"text":"I'm kind of on the fence with a 3-to-4 star review, but I'll stick with the 3 stars because while the food was indeed tasty, the place was not what I would consider \"polished,\" and it was pricy.

Four of us had breakfast at the Morning Glory Cafe.  Between us, we had two specials (quesadillas filled with some tasty meat and peppers, potatoes and eggs), the All American Breakfast, three sides of bacon, a side of biscuits and gravy, and coffee all around.  It was a bit chilly, as all they have is outdoor seating in the shade, and the propane heaters were more miss than hit (although they changed out the propane bottles in some of them that weren't working).  The outdoor furniture is nothing fancy, either.  Plastic chairs and wooden table tops fastened to a frame made out of rebar.  As to the restrooms - it's basically a trailer with a Men's and Women's door (one person at a time), and a step-to-flush (think RV style!) toilet.

In short, their website makes the place look much more modern and polished than it really is.

However...

The food was simply excellent!  Everything tasted great.  That will come at a price - for us, it was $85 (including tip)."}
{"text":"This place is really cute and relaxing. I really like the concept of the outdoor sitting and the open area. The sandwiches were good. The only thing was the price for everything. The price for a sandwich was a bit much. My husband and I both had a sandwich and soup and it was over 30 dollars. Also we ordered the potato soup and it had no flavor. I will give it another try for breakfast."}
{"text":"Jen and I walked down a long mulched farm road lined by trees.  It felt as if we weren't in Phoenix anymore.  Well, except for the burning desert sun overhead.

On the farm road there were a handful of dining options.  Our selection was Morning Glory Cafe.

There were lots of cute outdoor tables, some with umbrellas, scattered in a little garden courtyard.  Servers were mulling about offering muffins and scones from large baskets as you looked over your menu.  Unlike bread at many restaurants these carbs ain't free.  we were told to help ourselves to drinks.  Nearby, there were spigotted vessels with coffee, water, lemonade, and a unsweetened flavoured iced tea.  Again, you will be charged for these later.

Perusing the menu, we were torn because everything looked delicious. There were a handful of omelettes, eggs benedict, french toast, and even a french toast monte cristo.  You could also order beverages not on spigot, like fresh squeezed oj and mimosas (i think these were $7.50) from this menu.

Sticking with self-serve drinks, Jen ordered a South Mountain Omelette which came with rosemary roasted potatoes and an herb biscuit.  I ordered morning glory benedict minus the ham, which came with accoutrement of rosemary potatoes but no biscuit.  It seemed like our food came a few minutes after ordering it.  It was the fastest service I have ever experienced.

Jen's omelette had green peppers, red peppers, snap peas, tomatoes, swiss chard, and farmer's cheese ontop,  She said, \"This is the best omelette ever.\"  My eggs benedict (i'm a fan of benedicts) had perfectly poached eggs voluptuously mounting a tomato, on an english muffin bed, a dark green blanket of spinach draped over shoulders, and one of the best hollandaises ladeled ontop of it all.  It was delicious.  Also delicious was the rosemary roasted potatoes.  However, the biscuit was incredibly dry, so it was like mixing Quickrete(r) in yo mouf. (yes, i just said yo mouf)

It was very good food overall though with the eggs coming straight outta the hen house a few yards away and the veggies hailing from the equidistant farmer's market.  These fresh local ingredients make a big difference.

Morning Glory Cafe would make a great place to take out of town guests, family, bedheaded lovers, or hungover friends."}
{"text":"I can't believe it took me 8+ years to pay a visit to the Farm. I was drawn in my a free jazz event they had one Saturday morning so a friend and I drove out for brunch. We got there before the concert started so we walked around and took in the grounds before grabbing something to eat from the cafe and lounging at a picnic table for awhile. I would definitely recommend a visit, whether you are looking for local goods, a nice meal, planning an event or check out their calendar of events."}
{"text":"From Iowa. The sandwich and soup was great. Atmosphere was nice. Little pricey but overall nice."}
{"text":"Delicious food in a beautiful setting.  We loved walking among the pecan trees, sipping lemonade and looking at the farm animals.  They even have a small produce market.  I had the pecan cinnamon brioche french toast - it was amazing!  The caramel sauce was decadent!  My husband really enjoyed his omelet."}
{"text":"We absolutely love the Morning Glory restaurant here. The food is spectacular, but the setting really makes it. It's such a great place to take out-of-town guests to show them another side of Phoenix. Always a great experience!"}
{"text":"Food is very good. Customer service was horrible! I seldom give a bad review but this one deserved it. They were arrogant and mean. I was with my in-laws visiting from Ohio and 1 year old baby. I will not go back."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast at the little cafe in the back last week and it was great! The food was delicious and their patio is dog friendly. It was also pretty cold when we were there so it was nice that they had heaters out for everyone's comfort. A little spendy but I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I like the this place.   

The food is good, but the best thing is the atmosphere.   In Phx we have great weather much of the year, but it is hard to find a good outdoor eating place.   Most of Phx restaurants are on busy major roads, if you eat outside you are looking at a parking lot and being serenaded with traffic noise.   There are some nice outdoor places but they all seem to be really  $$ or crowded or poor food or loud.

The Farm is far from a road or even a big parking lot.   That does mean you usually have to walk a little ways, but it is a nice walk.   

Nothing like going their early in morning in April or March, very nice setting.

One person commented on flies - I never had this problem, not sure if this got better or worse.   I was last there over a year ago."}
{"text":"I always love coming here, simply because of how beautiful it is. As soon as you step foot you instantly get a country farm feeling and it's like you're suddenly not in Arizona. Lots of beautiful trees and green grass. Love it! I came here for their Valentine's Day special event and it was so cute. They provided picnic baskets that contained your choice of sandwiches for 2, side dishes, dessert, beverage, and a cute checkered blanket to lay out in the lawn or on a table. It was a beautiful memory that I still carry with me today. Would love to come back to eat for dinner next time :)"}
{"text":"Quaint, moderately priced and a fair food selection. It's a type of a grab-n-go with lots of yummy baked desserts. Love the outside eating space, but take note, don't go on a rainy day as it's only outside seating. Loved taking my out-of-town friends to this location."}

{"text":"Mixed review.

I liked their shops. Lots of fun items. I liked the produce stand. The man working there offered to hold my bags in a fridge while I went to eat. He was very helpful. 

The restaurant was not worth the wait. We waited well over and hour for a party of 2. Once seated, our table tilted when leaned on because it wasn't level, there were a ridiculous amount of flies, and little bits from the tree repeatedly fell into our drinks and food. 

The food was pretty good. It tasted very fresh, but a bit bland. The prices were really high."}
{"text":"Great breakfast.  I'm a breakfast guy.  I think I've had breakfast just about everywhere but I never thought about having it outside on an Arizona farm.  Nice time for the family, great atmosphere, very kind wait staff.  You're on my shortlist Farm At South Mountain!"}
{"text":"An interesting venue - definitely mixed feelings re. this review - take it with a grain of salt if you want to visit, but otherwise, consider other options if you have them.

Joan and I were visiting her sister in Phoenix, and, to be honest, we had no idea where to go and consulted Yelp.  This place came up first for breakfast in the rankings, and I'm not surprised.  I don't know much about Phoenix, but relative to my standards of NY/LA, there's not much there.  We were very happy to drive up to the farm, park, and sit down at a very nice table in a beautiful, popular, semi-rustic setting.  The weather was perfect and the atmosphere delightful.  

Service was also great to start, coffee was self-serve and tasty too  ...... if only the food had been good as well.  I hate to give two stars, but Joan's frittatta was straight-up cold and rubbery.  Doesn't get much worse than that - the waitstaff warned us that it was 'served at room temperature,' but seemed like that was all-too-subtle code for 'just don't order this - it's bad.'  Wish they had just said that.

I had Eggs Benedict and it was so-so OK, but not good enough to balance it all out.  In the end, the waitstaff switched through shifts too and they messed up the bill, so that didn't help either.  But more than anything it was the mediocre food that earned the two stars here - I hope they improve it, as the setting was delightful, but until they do I can't recommend the place.  

(As an alternative, though...what else, exactly, is in Phoenix?)"}
{"text":"Best veggie sandwich ever?  One of the tasty vegetables was orange, so I think it was a sweet potato or possibly a carrot, no matter it was awesome.  

Bread was soft and fresh,(I've almost broken teeth on some of the other really hard bread here before). 

I find the service counter a little odd, it doesn't flow very well.

Hurry up and go here people before it gets too hot!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here for lunch and for a wedding and both were amazing. This is such a cute little area and when you are there you can hardly tell you are in the desert. 

The wedding I attended here was gorgeous and the beautiful scenery adds the perfect backdrop.  

Love that there is a grassy area for the little ones to run around in."}
{"text":"Who knew this place was here. Located in South Phoenix in an area you wouldn't expect it.  Great for it's picnic type atmosphere and good old school healty food.  Don't forget to try the desserts as they are heavenly.  Summertime it is a great breakfast place on Saturdays but arrive early or you may have a wait."}
{"text":"I come here for breakfast/brunch frequently on the weekends. Today I decided to go. (Weekday) I didn't know they close at 11:00am But the staff still made us feel welcome. Like always, the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times it's pretty nice.. they have picnic tables to have ur lunches.. always get the Italian sandwich here and it never disappoints"}
{"text":"We had to wait for over an hour for our food AFTER we were seated and put our order in.  The service was horrible and the food was luke warm at best when it was served to is.  Cute spot, horrible service."}
{"text":"The Farm: First impression so cute! You enter and immediately want to have a picnic but luckily there are picnic benches for days. There is a map of the layout of the farm to navigate through their amenities definitely suggest a nice stroll before or even after your meal. I would give this part of my experience 5/5

Food: The carrot cake was highly recommended but just FYI the baker just had a baby and the carrot cake will not be available until she returns. We went to the sandwich and salad shop and ordered the Tuscan sandwich and slice of pecan pie. This was quite a pricey sandwich it was $11.95 so I was looking forward to the execution and ingredients of the sandwich for the price. The sandwich was lacking in flavor and was disappointing in the ratio of thick focaccia bread to the ingredients which made the sandwich too dry. The focaccia bread also was tough to bite into with an expectation of being much softer it seemed like the bread came right out of the refrigerator.  I would have enjoyed the sandwich more if it was toasted and salt/seasoning levels improved. The slice of pecan pie was enjoyable not overly sweet and enjoyed its custard like filling. This food part of my experience was a 3/5 there is a lot of potential for improving their sandwiches."}
{"text":"Who doesn't like farm to fork field work, right? These farmers not only are wise but sharing their bounty with the public has to be rewarding especially with their commitment to a fresh and sustainable philosophy.

It's the weekend and there are families all around.  Children are playing ball or frisbee with their siblings or their parents, under the dormant pecan trees. Adam Smith is singing and playing guitar. The sound of music, people chatting and laughing with excited children playing is soothing to the soul.

I order an egg salad sandwich $9.95. This house serves baked goods and pastries too. I also purchased a little pecan pie. The organic gardens are attractive but I decided to relax on the grass in the shade leaning up against a pecan tree and enjoy my refreshing iced black tea and meal.

Can a farm morph into a most alluring and impressive restaurant worthy of the highest accolade a critic can award? You know it can."}
{"text":"I love that The Farm always has activities and a variety of food choices along with wine. It's a beautiful scenic location. You can enjoy this as a date night or as a family picnic! Not too expensive."}
{"text":"I really want to like the farm. I do enjoy the atmosphere. I got the roasted carrot sandwich an the tomato and pesto soup. I am not sure what exactly was missing but something was missing from the tomato soup. It seemed very oily. I did enjoy the sandwich and I am always appreciative when people experiment with new ingredients. I would love to try it with mozzarella vs feta though.

Pro-tip: You have to park across the street which can be a little dicey."}
{"text":"Good portion size and quality machaca.  All outdoor seating so bring a jacket in the winter.  Good service, good food."}
{"text":"there were too many flies, it is outside and people bring their dogs
to sit on the chairs.  Everything from the trees flies on the table and in your food.   There is no accessability for the handicapped at all, there is no pavement, you are walking in mud and on rocks.    Also the bathrooms
are awful and no one wears gloves at all!!!!"}
{"text":"This spot is a must visit. The food and service are 5 stars. The location and menu make it 6 stars. The wait can be a little long, so allow for some extra time, but this is a must visit!"}
{"text":"Went here for a wedding. It's a really great venue - quiet, romantic, etc.  As for the food, my scallops were so salty I couldn't touch my 2nd scallop. Maybe it was just me.  Another irritating part - so the person next to me ordered the soup for the first course. We were the last table to be served - they ran out of soup when they got  to him- so he had less than half the portion. The server said she'd be back to finish but never came back.  Liar! I hate liars.  More than being shortchanged on soup. The other irritating part was the +hour wait between courses. I felt like gnawing my limbs off and so when the salty scallops showed up I was angry.  Maybe this place is only good for breakfast type foods. (sry for the choppy review - tend to get this way on iPhone)"}
{"text":"Best eggs I have ever had and take my word for it, I am very picky with my eggs. This is a straight up farm with the gardens, trees, and chickens. It was absolutely beautiful. You sit outside surrounded by mother nature and your breakfast comes out at record speed nice and hot. I ordered the eggs skillet with the truffle oil. The vegetables were delicious, the eggs were perfect, and I am a new fan of truffle oil. After the delicious breakfast, i walked over to the chicken coop and thanked the chickens for my delicious breakfast as it would not have been possible without them. I will definitely come back here. They have different places for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Visited this place as it seemed like a unique experience... sadly it did not meet up to the hype. Location, Location, location is the only thing that is worth anything more than 3 stars. The food was nothing special and a little unflavored. Do not get the broccoli and cheddar soup... it is not cheesy at all. The soup has the consistency of boiled grains with yellow food coloring."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! This brown bag sandwich, salad, and soup place is soooo good. Although a little pricey ($15 pp sandwich+drink), it's worth every penny. You will know what I mean when you sit down at a picnic table in the sun, under huge pecan trees. If you have kids or dogs , bring them with their frisbees and toys. The turkey club sandwich is excellent, so is the chicken salad sandwich. ALL of their salads are amazing, as are their sides (dreaming of their sweet potato salad). The ingredients used are top quality, fresh, and amazing!"}
{"text":"Good food, they soften the butter for you ; -)
Self serve water coffee, ice tea . You sit outside but it's shaded."}
{"text":"Never would have thought to put squash, asparagus, corn and eggplant inside an omelette. It was however one of the best omelettes I've had. My wife and I definitely plan on returning to this great location for the ambiance and food."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere at the Farm (when it's not too hot) and the food is pretty darn good every time I've gone.  The downsides are it's a little pricy and gets pretty crowded when it's nice out."}
{"text":"Outdoor seating was very nice, food was delivered very quickly after placing order, staff very helpful, Will be returning to try the picnic basket lunch under the trees!"}
{"text":"Awesome food with a great experience. After breakfast, kids loved walking around the garden, trees and viewing the chickens. Great atmosphere and the food was great."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT place for breakfast in Phoenix. Located on a farm, complete with farmer's market, animals, scenery...you can walk around while you wait for breakfast. 

Start with a bloody mary-they make great ones here!

Seating is outside and so refreshing. Opted for huevos rancheros here and it was great!

Ambiance and change of scenery is the best part about this place."}
{"text":"Cute cute spot and a fun idea... but I cannot get past the fact that even with plastic silverware, picnic style containers... and no servers, our bill was astronomical.  Be careful how much you get!

Anyway, the soup was the best part.  The bread was ridiculously hard on my sandwich.  The Pecan Pie was gelatin-ish and weird.

But it is fun to sit outside in this nice space."}
{"text":"This is a fun place to go for breakfast. Love the history on the place and how it became a farm. The food is good and so is the service for a place that is always so busy. Within the same farm they have a lunch restaurant and a dinner restaurant that are on my list to visit.
You can also buy organic vegetables and watch them planting and/or picking the produce.
There are picnic tables and families come to celebrate birthdays or special occasions at this place.
I like this place very much!"}
{"text":"Wow! $50 for breakfast for 2 and the potatoes were stone cold and a semi-attentive server!!! The guy on the table next to us was having a conversation on speaker phone the whole entire time (very loud)! The outside environment was pleasant and that's the only upside. Will not return."}
{"text":"Being 72, I felt my parents tremble a bit when I said I was taking them to the \"farm\". Growing up in the midwest, it wasnt rare to hear \"somebody bought the farm\". This did not mean an uncle decided to purchase a ranch, but rather, met his maker, is now six feet under or my favorite, \"he's in a better place now.\" That said, my folks were delighted at our Farm experience. It's always a challenge getting dad a plain sandwich in any restaurant but they were very accommodating. Mom and I both enjoyed our turkey sandwiches and the ice tea is extra good. Maybe it's brewed in the sun. That would be very farm-like, no? Now, I get the whole theme here with the picnic tables and all. Just not a big fan of it myself. That, and walking on grass. Ewww! But it's called the Farm and not the City, so no points docked for that. Really a unique Phoenix experience with a gift shop, walking trails and the smell of dirt. So hitch up your tractor and git on down to the Farm."}
{"text":"Feels like home...you can putter for hours and all the food is spectacular. If you want to feel like you're not in Phoenix for a few hours it's a great sanctuary."}
{"text":"Just happened here, on a business trip, between arriving at the airport and our afternoon meeting.  It was like we were in Sonoma, not Phoenix.

The pulled pork tacos were really nice and fresh, the tortilla soup a bit oily.  Someone else got some bread pudding and it was gooood.

Somehow, they ran out of running water, even in the bathrooms.  Strange, is that just part of this being a farm?"}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me and my little chihuahua here for lunch. Yayyyy, dog friendly. How beautiful is this place.. We sat outside. It was so nice out as well.

I ordered the Vegetarian sandwich and mushroom soup. The sandwich was okay, it wasn't that great be honest. If anything to put too much mayonnaise on it. The mushroom soup was so bland. No flavor nor was it hot. *sad face*"}
{"text":"Beautiful scenery and surroundings. The place was cute and charming, excellent to eat outdoors. Staff was friendly overall but hardly check on customers.
We got there and we were excited as it looked rather promising and it was cute. However, we signed the waiting list to be seated but they messed up our name and they sat everyone but us. It took 40 minutes to get us seated until we asked why people who had been there for 5 minutes were getting seated before us. Instead of correcting their mistake they told us to wait 10 more minutes.
Food was ok, good choices but super overpriced for what you get. It's cute and charming but that's about it for me on this one due to the experience."}
{"text":"We ate here on Mothers Day at the Morning Glory Cafe. Our food was great. Everyone in our group cleared their plates. I had the Juevos Rancheros and it did not dissapoint. I also tried the French toast and the sausage gravy. Everything amazing. We had good service too!  We got lucky and were seated in the shade.  The only part I didnt like was that it was up to us to find out own high chair and we could only find 2 in the entire resturant and they were in use.  I think the staff should find the high chair, especially since when we made a reservation, we said we needed 2."}
{"text":"We went here for a wedding reception. It turned out great. Went on an 87 degree weather. A little hot when the sun was up but as soon as it settled the weather couldn't be any more beautiful. They did have a few shaded area which helped during the hot moments. Lots of playing area for the kids, the food tasted good and the staff were extremely friendly. We didn't pay for the food so I'm not sure on the pricing."}
{"text":"I can't stop coming here. From the day that I discovered this place, I'm here pretty much any chance I get for lunch.

It's incredible to drive less than 10 minutes from my client's offices and find myself at a beautiful farm. I love eating at the wooden picnic tables under the trees that adorn the long grass field adjacent to the Farm's kitchen. 

You feel like you've left the world you were in, and gone off to simpler time and place, the kind you see in movies or read about in books. It's an incredible 30 minute vacation from work. Just be careful as the summer months approach, eating outside can take it's toll in 100 degree weather.

But the Farm doesn't get a 5-star rating on ambiance alone - the food here is fantastic. Everything is about as fresh as it can be - the vegetables are crisp and vibrant, the breads are all fresh baked and incredibly delicious, and the meats are always tender and juicy.

I love getting two half sandwiches (at no extra cost), and frequently will choose an old favorite and an interesting new item.

My absolute favorites:

Tuscan Sandwich . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $10.95
Grilled herb chicken, marinated artichokes, 
shredded Parmesan Reggiano and Asiago, 
balsamic dressing, tomatoes, herb mayo and 
organic field greens on focaccia

Grilled Chicken BLTDA Sandwich . . . . . . . . . $10.95
Marinated chicken breast, crisp Meat Shop 
bacon, organic field greens, local Black Sphinx 
dates, Granny Smith apples and tomatoes with 
basil mayo on potato bread

And if you're eating vegetarian (make sure to add avocado):

Farm Fresh Seasonal Sandwich . . . . . . . . . . . . $10.95
Local seasonal roasted vegetables, shredded 
Parmesan Reggiano and Asiago, hummus and 
organic field greens on nine-grain

Every dessert I've had here is marvelous. The chocolate cake stands out as magical (incredibly rich, yet somehow feels light enough to float on air).

Go. Now."}
{"text":"I had a nice experience here. I enjoy eating outdoors when the weather is nice and it is fun to walk around the grounds. They let me try a sample of their soups because I couldn't decide which one to have. The egg salad was excellent. I would definitely go back to the farm. It is a great place to go and visit when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"We saw the reviews and decided to stop. Glad we did. The meats are local and the greens are grown on the farm. We were planning on ordering sandwiches for the road, but the farm is so charming we decided to eat on the property. we were surrounded by pecan trees and I even had the opportunity to show my sons where pecans come from. The chicken salad sandwich was one of the best I have had,"}
{"text":"Super late post but The atmosphere is beautiful !!! The food is very very healthy so if you are expecting to chow down it is not for you however its good none the less especially for group outings and special occasions someone was having their bridal shower and we were having a mothers day lunch! People also get married here :) At night the lights are simply beautiful !!!"}
{"text":"Finally got to eat brunch at the Morning Glory cafe and it was fantastic! The only downside was the cost of Bloody Mary's...$9??? That's steep. For this time of year, the setting and the weather definitely enhance the dining experience. Our waiter/host was fantastic, especially when he offered my friend a great-smelling rose. I wish I had more opportunities to make this my weekly brunch spot."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place to enjoy the afternoon with great company.  This was my second visit to The Farm and boy the weather was prime for it.  We ate at the lunch restaurant because we got to the Farm right at 1pm as the breakfast restaurant was closing.  

The picnic baskets were awesome as we took our food and wondered into the large grassy area under a couple of tress to enjoy the beautiful Arizona spring weather.

I can't wait to comeback.  This is definitely the type of place to bring some family or friends that aren't from AZ to enjoy a great meal and the great Arizona weather.

They do close down during the summer months so just make sure the Farm is open if your planning on making a trip."}
{"text":"This is a very interesting place offering a very casual family and somewhat dog friendly picnic atmosphere.  I would describe it as an outdoor cafe of sorts. I'm sure that's why they chose the name they did. Just sayin' .....don't expect a restaurant.  
They do a great business because the food tasty. The sandwiches are the way we would love to make them if we had the time to shop for the culinary ingredients.  The atmosphere as I mentioned is very casual and family \"picnic like\".  You order your food at the cash register counter and then walk outside and sit near a small window where an employee \"calls your number\".  The food ordering and pickup system just felt more like McDonalds than a cafe or bistro where you pay $26 for two sandwiches and small drinks. The sandwich doesn't even include a small bag of chips or even a pickle slice!  In my opinion it's priced more like a fine cafe that offers more \"service\" than the fast (although healthy) food system they currently offer.  It's actually a shame because I'd come back over and over if I felt overall it was a better value and experience.  Give it a try though and see what you think."}
{"text":"I love the place. A lot of nature and very relaxing place. The food is organic. I really recommend it for lunch too."}
{"text":"The outdoor breakfast spot is family and pet friendly. It is all outdoor seating and serve yourself water and coffee. The wait staff is friendly prompt and on the move. The breakfast items are delicious and large portions. The biscuits wow ask for an extra delicious. If you enjoy the outdoor seating this is the place for you and your family. Gravel driveway drive up slowly."}

Very pricey, but w knew that going
Handicap 1 star. Walkway uneven. Parking lot all gravel
No AC inside or at least not turned on
We were four quests and received two pieces of small bread pp
If we wanted more it was a $4 extra charge
When we received the check we were charged THREE TIMES FOR \"ROCK\" - ice. +$2, +$4, +$6. $12.00 for ice that was used to shake our Martinis.

Will not return
ICE - Poor business policy"}
{"text":"Loved the farms ! It is beautiful and serene. The food was delicious as well. We went on a whim for Sunday Brunch and were very pleased with the food portions.  We were there in arizona visiting family, several had said they never heard of this place. We told them how awesome it was and thatvthe definitely have to check it out. Next time I'm in Arizona I will eat here again ."}
{"text":"This is about the ONLY reason I miss my old job: it was right around the corner from \"The Farm\".
The first time I went, I thought it was so peaceful to be in a city!  I love the outdoor picnic tables and their potato salad is to die for!  
It reminds me of my small town back East.  Friendly, open-air, with good, homemade food."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Endless possibilities of spots to eat. Fresh farm food. A little pricey, but worth every penny. Very romantic lunch spot, great atmosphere. Will come back!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem! It offers separate restaurants for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Came here on a Sunday for brunch which ends at 1pm. You just have to be seated by then, and from what we noticed, a few came in after that and were able to be seated.

That being said, it would be tough for a wheelchair or elderly people to make it to the brunch restaurant. It is all the way in the back of the property and the parking lot is across the street. The rest of the trek is gravel and dirt.

Everything they serve here comes from the property you are at. You can truly taste the freshness and your body will thank you. I had the chorizo scramble and it was excellent. A very filling meal, the flavors were vibrant and the atmosphere wonderful. For drinks, they have a self serve, station with lemonade, teas, coffees, etc. The speed of te service was excellent and very courteous.

This is a great place for groups or a couple to dine!"}
{"text":"Food used to be way way way way better. Now I feel like the quality had definitely gone down. Atmosphere is 5 star no doubt. Just wish the food was like it was.."}
{"text":"Wonderful place to unwind, take a lovely stroll around the grounds, the beautiful big trees, enjoy good fresh food on a lovely shaded patio. Highly recommend it. They are only open two more weeks before closing for the hot summer time."}
{"text":"After a late night at work on Saturday, a late Sunday brunch at the Farm sounded amazing! We pulled in around 10:00, and were warned by someone at the front that the wait for breakfast was at least 45 minutes, but there wasn't wait for lunch. By 10:00, I didn't really care whether I ate breakfast or lunch - just that I ate. 

We walked in to place our lunch orders, and I was a little surprised by the cost of the food, but it looked really good. I ordered the albacore tuna sandwich and grabbed a sugar cookie as a little after-lunch treat. The tuna was amazing, and the veggies and cheese on my sandwich were so fresh! Definitely worth the $10. My sugar cookie was great too! It was almost like a mix between a muffin and a cookie, and was made with all natural ingredients, so it wasn't artificially sweet. 

The outdoor seating area is huge, and was perfect for a beautiful spring morning. I hope to arrive earlier next time so I can check out the breakfast, but will definitely be back for lunch."}
{"text":"Beautiful property, nice place to spend a lazy weekend morning. But the food is overpriced, and really small in quantity. I got the Italian sandwich with meats and pepperchini and cheese....it was good, though very much on the salty side. My friend got pasta. It was simple and tasty, but the quantity was so little that he was done in 5 minutes! My sandwich came with no sides. The passionfruit ice tea I got was delicious, though. I think the food prices include the price of the entire \"experience\"--the farm, the artists cottage and the ranch-like atmosphere just a short drive away from the city. That's what makes this place pricey. I had a coupon from Groupon so I didn't feel too bad about it! Oh, and we saw some people out in the picnic area with metal detectors....don't know if The Farm had hired them, but they were using those detector thingies to hunt for quarters! One of the men said on most \"expeditions\" they find rings dropped by guests. So be careful, people!"}
{"text":"Food: 3 stars
I ordered a Portabello Mushroom sandwich.  It was pricey!  I understand that they use local/organic ingredients, but still I think it could be priced a bit lower.  The bread on the sandwich wasn't that great either.  Slightly on the dry side and I didn't like the crust, too hard.  The biggest drawback for me was that I was still hungry after eating my $11 sandwich!  I went home and ate another meal....

My friend got a TEENY tiny Greek salad - literally it could have fit in a 1 cup measuring cup (which they don't even serve with Greek dressing by the way... so the only thing that really makes it \"Greek\" is the olives and sprinkles of feta) and it cost like $6, meh.

Service: 2 stars
Even though there was no line behind me, I felt like I was being rushed through.  And this being my first time there I had questions, but the lady at the counter didn't seem receptive to answering them for me.  For example, I asked if I could substitute salad for soup in the sandwich/soup combo and all she said was \"the salads are over there\".... that's not an answer!

Ambiance: 4 stars
BEAUTIFUL grounds with lovely tall pecan trees towering over a lawn with lots of outdoor picnic tables to eat your lunch.  and lots of cute little nooks to explore.  There are duck pens in the back, a little shop where they sell plants, and overall just a really cute and lovely setting.  The location/grounds are the best reason to return.  It's dog friendly so bring your pooch here for a stroll!"}
{"text":"Ehhhh, went here with the family and some friends this Easter for the brunch and expected amazing.....  $60 per person and the food was average other than the french toast was very good.  It had a large amount of pecans and fresh bananas too. 

Pros:

-Selection of Food was good quality
-Venue was shaded where you eat and linen table cloth was used
-Staff was very friendly 
-Large area to walk around and take pictures
-Easy Parking

Cons:

-Table cloth was not changed between seatings so we had to ask to have our dirty linen changed
-Grass and trees were not looking sharp.  Grass was mostly brown and not pretty like the pics showed
-Water lines and juice lines were very long as well as paid specialty drinks line. 
-No bloody Mary's??  Bizarre
-Easter Bunny was MIA most of the event as he was  the only bunny and kept getting overheated. 

All In all it was a nice event.  I don't believe I will return for an encore performance next year as I think this was just not our thing. 

Try it out and tell me your thoughts.

Happy Easter!"}
{"text":"We had lunch on the picnic tables! The food was good! The atmosphere was great, it's a beautiful place!  We brought a tablecloth and it was great!"}
{"text":"We went to the Farm to check out the Farmer's Market and go to lunch.  It was amazing.  I can't believe this is only 15 minutes from my cookie cutter stucco house.  It's almost hard to believe it's even in Phoenix - though to a native like me, it's just one more reason to remember why Phoenix is so great.  

When most folks used to think of South Phoenix they thought of crime, blight and anything else associated with being on the \"wrong\" side of the tracks.  Sure, there may have been areas right next to downtown that were like that, but most of South Phoenix was all farming community.  While some of this still exists - especially near and in Laveen - most of these farm plots were sold off during the years to individuals for their own homes - and any of the large lots were sold off to developers in the last 10-15 years or so.  Most of these became mass produced houses (like mine) or shopping centers.  The Farm is off of 32nd street (with property stretching back almost to 24th street) between Baseline and Southern.   To put this in perspective - there is a huge Target/Fry's/Ross/Applebee's kind of complex at 24th and Baseline - and the South Mountain Community College is just North of that on 24th.  At 32nd and Baseline there is the Raven Golf course, with lots of condos all around it.  That all seems a whole world away once you pull in to The Farm.

I'm attaching some pictures from their web site www.thefarmatsouthmountain.com.  I've been only to one of the restaurants so far - The Farm Kitchen which is their lunch spot.  But I plan to visit Morning Glory soon.  All the stores are amazing - and it's so cool to see where it all grows.  As we walked by the gardens it was great to see some kids (and adults) having the process explained to them of how they grow the food organically here - and it could end up at one of their restaurants, in one of the nicer restaurants in the valley, or sold at their Farmers market to be eaten in their own home.

Check out their menus online.  Yes - it's a bit pricey.  I was hesitant that I'd think it was \"worth it\".  But oh it was.  I can't explain it any better than stealing from a commercial - You can TASTE the freshness!  Everything just tasted so much better.  Not that the atmosphere didn't help - but it wasn't the only factor.  One interesting thing to mention - pets are ok.  There were two folks there who brought their dogs.  The doggies seemed quite happy to have some run around space (leashed of course) and then a nice meal by a picnic bench.  

I'm planning to go again - bringing lots of friends and family at different times.  I'd love to try out their yoga and/or gardening classes too! This will definitely be on the short list of places a visitor needs to go when visiting from out of town.  Better yet though - it's one of the few places you can go in town and feel like you took a day trip out of the valley."}
{"text":"Great outdoor eating, but very pricey. 
Had 3 sandwiches (Italian, tuna, and egg salad) with pasta (oily not tangy) and fruit salads (bland and soggy). The sandwiches  were good (and hearty) but not really great. Drinks were outrageous (nearly $3 for a drip coffee and nearly $5 for bottled juice). After dropping over $60 for 2 adults and 2 kids, I'll go to Joe's Farm Grill next time in in the mood for something similar."}
{"text":"The Farm was beautiful, but the wait was definitely not worth it. We were there for an hour and a half, and still have to wait 20 more minutes. I decided it was not worth it and we left the Farm to another location. 

I might attempt to go back at another time, time will tell."}
{"text":"I love the surrounding farm! If you want to have a retreat away from the office in the middle of the day this is a great spot. The food is really good! A little pricey but you get what you pay for. It's usually crowded and you have to stand in line to order but I don't mind standing amongst the trees and plants. They aren't open all year around for lunch so you may want to call first. There is only outside seating.  Don't let the neighborhood scare you off, it's a really nice place. Take me away!!!!"}
{"text":"Way too expensive! Joe's farm grill in Gilbert has way better options and friendlier prices. 
$9 for a glass of Sangria they were advertising and they didn't even have it available.
For my family of four we spent $60 and we all drank water.
The salad was huge and ok, but for that price I could have gotten a week's worth of salads from the grocery store."}
{"text":"Trying to figure out what to have for breakfast - not really wanting the the usual hotel fare of sausage, scrambled eggs and french toast that's been sitting on a warming table. Talking with S on the phone this morning and he's on Yelp looking for unique places for me to check out that's in close proximity to my hotel. He mentions the Farm at South Mountain - it sounds intriguing, so why not? It sounds so much better than what was being offered at the hotel.

The Farm at South Mountain is one of Phoenix's gems...

When I first arrived, I wasn't quite sure what to make of the place.  I took a walk down the little road towards the back end of the property. Here you will find an open grassy area with shade trees and rows of picnic tables and space enough for kids to run and stretch out their legs. There's also an expansive organic garden with rows of vegetables and flowers which I understand supplies the cafes that are on site with all their fresh produce. A little further behind the garden, the Morning Glory Cafe serves breakfast, The Retreat - a place for massages, facials, Reiki and mid-wife counseling, and the Cottage - a place for local artists to display and showcase their artwork.

After I had breakfast at the Morning Glory Cate (that's another review) I spent some time at the artists studio looking over the work of some very talented artists.

The lunch spot is the Farm Kitchen which is located towards the entrance of the complex. By the time I walked toward the entrance, the Farm Kitchen was bustling with the lunch crowd. I didn't get lunch, but from what I could tell, everything looked fresh and yummy. I stopped in to pick up some fruit, some bakery goods and a drink while waiting for the hotel shuttle to come pick me up. 

The Farm at South Mountain is a great place to find respite from the hustle and bustle of the city - even for a short while."}
{"text":"This place is really great, whether it be for Breakfast or Lunch. The setting is calming and has great places to sit back and relax in the sun or in the shade. The food is really great and made fresh from products at Mayas Farm. 
Can be a little expensive compared to that of a fast food chain, but you get what you pay for. The food is well worth it."}
{"text":"Looking around the Farm at South Mountain, one could easily forget you were in Arizona.  With the large grassy field and mature pecan trees offering ample shade, it feels a bit more like the Midwest!  It offers a great backdrop for 3 great restaurants.  We have eaten at the Farm Kitchen twice in the last 2 weeks!  The soups are usually good.  Loved their turkey vegetable and black bean, but the enchilada soup was a bit greasy and one dimensional.  Desserts are very good.  My favorite is the chocolate cake! Da bomb!  However, the coconut cake is ho hum with little flavor.  The sandwiches are good.  The turkey was probably the best, and a recent special Grinder was good as well.  Good selection of chips and small sides to complete your meal! All served in adorable wicker baskets.

Great place to take kids!  Plenty of room to run and play and dogs are welcome too!  Great place to walk around or roll in the grass!"}
{"text":"The patio was perfect for a beautiful October brunch. I got a turkey sandwich and tomato soup for about $11. I loved that it came out in a picnic basket! Quite the enjoyable meal, I look forward to returning!"}
{"text":"I cannot believe it has taken me 19 years of living in Phoenix to get out to The Farm. The breakfast at Morning Glory Cafe is unbeatable, truly. My omelette with fresh veggies and crispy potatoes were so flavorful, but that little buttermilk biscuit was dynamite. Nice homemade jam to go with it too. My mom had the waffle and it was so fluffy, crispy on the outside, and some plump juicy fresh fruit on top. I can't wait to go back and try the French toast! Wait staff is friendly and the get-your-own drink station is clever and easy. The ambience is so nice here, and sitting outside with out-of-town guests was a true pleasure. Thanks to you!!!"}
{"text":"I took my out-of-town visitor here based on the rave reviews other yelpers gave it and, let me just say, there was no disappointment!  It was a bit chilly because we had to eat outside in mid-January, but they had heat lamps out to make sure people didn't freeze their arses off (however, it would be wise to bring a jacket depending on how sensitive to cold ya are).

As soon as we got there, a nice young waitress brought out a basket of scones and muffins in case we wanted to buy any for $2.95.  I had some kind of almond sweet delicious-ness of a muffin and it was well worth the 3 bucks.  I then ordered a la carte and had eggs and rosemary taters.  My friend had a mushroom and tomato omelette.  Boy did we enjoy ourselves.  It was a very pleasant, airy, light-hearted kind of environment, complete with little finches chirping and flitting about here and there as if you were in the movie \"Willow\" or something.  My friend couldn't deny the finches crumbs from her tasty herbed biscuit.  If it were me, I woulda scarfed down the whole thing and said to hell with the finches. 

Either way, we both had a wonderful time.  It was a great way to end her visit to Arizona before her flight back to North Carolina.  Although the prices were a little bit on the higher side (hovering around 10 bucks a dish, including bottomless coffee), it was well worth it.  And it's also refreshing to visit a breakfast place that actually attempts to be organic and doesn't deep-fry everything it serves."}
{"text":"If you want to bring a woman to a place that she will remember for a long time as a special memory ' take her to the farm house for breakfast - the place is an actual farm - you sit outside under massive trees and look out over natural herb gardens - there is I'd guess a couple acres filled with picnic tables and shaded trees - there was an event with maybe 30 women today and you hardly noticed they were there - they were tucked away in small groups throughout the property - food is all natural - Mexican / American while you wait have coffee or lemonade and walk the peaceful grounds - large portions excellent prices friendly wait staff it's just an amazing concept very well executed"}
{"text":"Okay, so the food is solidly good. If you just want some regular, good tasting food, this is the place. The ambiance is so cozy and lovely, too! Great for families with children that love to run around outside."}
{"text":"I hate cooing over how \"cute\" places are, but the Farm is SO CUTE.

After brunch, we walked around the grounds and checked out the chickens, which I would describe as \"MAJESTIC\" and also \"NOBLE.\"  The hens looked really happy, just clucking around and soaking up some sun.  It made me feel bad for liking to eat them.

It can only imagine how gorgeous the Farm is in the summer - I'd love to take out a big woven blanket and a book to lay around the farm on a lazy afternoon, doing nothing except...

periodically walking about to admire the chickens."}
{"text":"What a delightful surprise to stumble upon this neighborhood local farm and market after I just ventured out in search of a new breakfast place! The wait for the breakfast restaurant was 45 minutes however after walking the farm, buying some fresh greens, produce and watching a duck lay eggs, I'm glad we decided to head back to the brunch building. We enjoyed amaziny \"bltcda\" (bacon, lettuce, tomato, chicken, dates, apple) half sandwich with soup ( cream of mushroom and Italian sausage were both amazing), potato salad,  greek salad and some sodas..  Needless to say, I can't wait to get back to Phoenix to try the breakfast with my cute boyfriend ;)"}
{"text":"It's really called Morning Glory Cafe.
It's on a farm that's all organic. My sister asked \"Do you think they spray for flies?\" but immediately noticed the incongruity.

The sausage at the breakfast place was really good.

An admin at Yelp needs to move these reviews over there. I give it a 5 mostly to counteract the one-star. Otherwise, I didn't pay, but I'd give it at least a 4 on taste.

Look for the rest of the reviews for this place here: http://www.yelp.com/biz/morning-glory-cafe-phoenix#hrid:YAbb2MOxdLvD4qkvlO7Wug/src:search/query:The%20Farm"}
{"text":"A favorite spot for lunch on the weekends.  You order up your food in a little farmhouse.  Pick from a selection of farm fresh sandwiches, salads, soups, and fresh baked goods.  Everything is very good.  Then grab a picnic table in the pecan grove and enjoy the fresh air, Arizona sunshine, and serene view of South Mountain stretching before you.  This is a great place to take the whole family.  The kids can run around and play while you enjoy a meal out.  A perfect day in the country without having to leave the city."}
{"text":"I'm mortified!  I've never written a review of the Farm at South Mountain?  I'm not sure how this is even possible!

I go here so often that this might actually be my favorite place in Phoenix to go for a relaxing cool/warm Saturday or Sunday afternoon in PHoenix.  In fact, I think I'm headed there momentarily.

Many people write reviews for the various \"businesses\" at the Farm on South Mountain on the wrong Business/Venue pages.  But I guess this listing is a catch-all for everything.  Let's see if I can help people get this clear.  I really want to point that the Farm at South Mountain has several \"businesses\" and venues listed on Yelp.  You can go here for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  You can have your baby shower here or your 200+ person wedding and reception here.  You can hold a corporate event in \"Stoned Grove\" area around an outdoor pizza oven or you can have an intimate dinner under mature trees with glimmers of stars at night at Quiessence.  This place is a one stop shop for everything simple and beautiful in the out of doors.  I've written reviews for a few of the places on the farm and I will let those reviews speak for themselves.  I've posted pics too... 

One of the things that the Yelping community might appreciate knowing is that you should visit their website for special events.  Sometimes, they have special Farm dinners.  Sometimes there's a special holiday dinner or lunch.  For instance, I know for Valentine weekend, they have Valentine Dinners and Picnic lunches.  

Here are my reviews of places on the farm:

Maya's Farm (At the end of the Farm Drive and directly North.)
Organic Certified Farm.  See them at the Farm on Sunday mornings.  Phoenix Public Market on Saturdays and also get on their CSA)-

There are a few other businesses on the Farm listed on Yelp
Weddings:
(I am sure there was a wedding listing on Yelp for the FASM because I used to check in to it accidentally when I first started Yelping.  If I find it, I will update)

Quiessence (I haven't written a reveiw of this either.  SMH!!):

This is a great place to visit after you've completed a Hike on South Mountain too.  Enjoy.  Thank me later."}
