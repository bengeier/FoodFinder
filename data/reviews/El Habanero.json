{"text":"Excellent burritos fresh ingredients  GoOd ! !  go easy on that habanero hot sauce it can be hot for most of us."}
{"text":"I wanted to try something new and as I was wandering in the area, I've decided to pick up takeaway food at El Habanero. This location is nicely decorated, there's a very big terrace overlooking the Cote-des-Neiges street and that's always a plus especially during the summer. The service was quick as we were the only customers there, we ordered burritos and fries which came with choices of toppings and proteins but no guacamole, you have to pay extra if you want to add it to your combo... you pay extra for guacamole at a Mexican fast food joint *confused*... Maybe I don't go out enough but I've never heard such thing it's like having to pay for ketchup at a burger joint.... anyway, the food was ok, nothing out of the ordinary... just a little bit too expensive for what it was."}
{"text":"Went here with my supervisor and coworker and loved it. Had the rice bowl and it was so yummy. Would definitely go back here again."}
{"text":"Not a bad deal in CDN. Food is not fantastic but filling and tasty. It's a good option for a quick and cheap lunch."}
{"text":"I had a burrito with shrimps and it was ok, nothing special. Not much to say here.. The place was clean."}
