{"text":"Okay Let me start by saying that reason I am giving this place a two star was service first thing I call to ask if they serve food all night and what the hours were the bartender on the phone was a female this is her exact words \"Yes this is a BAR we are 24hrs and serve food all day\" I said okay thank you and she hung up no good bye or thank nada! So, I am starving I just got home from working on the strip and I work at Bar too that closes at one in the morning that is why I called to ask. My husband and I walk inside and sit right in front of the bar at one of the high tops it was 15 mins before anyone came to greet us or give us any menus. Finally, a male bartender came and greeted us he was friendly but was in a rush to get our order he just handed us the menu and asked \"Do you know what you want?\" We needed a min and did not ask if we wanted some thing to drink or nothing just \"I assumed you been here before\". Retarded how can you say that to a guest. So, he came around sooner than I thought to take our order the way it was going we asked for it to go. I ordered the chicken dinner with rice and veggies; my man got a bucket of buffalo wings with extra buffalo on the side and an order of fried cheese. Then he asks do you want a drink while you wait we both said no it is okay.( In my head you'd probably bring it when the food is ready anyway.)  So it took 30 to 45 mins for the bar food to come out; we had paid before hand too and had to go up to the bar to ask the bartender how much longer that's when he finally got the food. I guess he noticed we gave him 20% and was extremely fast and nice I walked out My husband stayed to get some ranch to go. When we get home his wings were PLAIN we hand to melt butter and mix it with franks to toss the wings in to make them buffalo. Other than that the food was good the veggies did not seem fresh if anything they are frozen or canned. This review got two stars because the male bartender was nice and food was okay."}
{"text":"This place has good beer choices and the hot pretzel bites are awesome!  There food is mediocre at best. If they are busy, they are very slow. They have one waitress for the entire restaurant plus two bartenders. I went on a Friday night and it was loud and extremely slow service."}
{"text":"I had a great time hanging out with Britney and Dale. So friendly and pleasant to hang out with!! I will definitely be back!! I love the shuffle board and the gaming machines gave me a little play. Food was great. It's all good : )! Oh and if you get to make it in there during the day, see bartender Dolores.. She's awesome!"}
{"text":"I always sit in the bar area and the bartenders are always attentive and friendly. Good prices for what you get. Corned beef sandwich is awesome. The sweet potato fries are really good too!"}
{"text":"They just changed the menu and what a disappointment! They did bring back some original items from Molly's, but the portions are smaller at the same price.   The new Pork fried steak is horrible and about the size of a hockey puck.   I do not recommend coming here for food!"}
{"text":"Dale just put the Yankees Red Sox game on as I arrived last minute. Way to go!!! Great last stop of the night!!!"}
{"text":"The Fish n' Chips isn't on the menu, you have to ask, but it's really good! Ambience isn't great but there are plenty of TVs, and a good happy hour. Great for locals to catch a game. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Food is ok if u can get it. I work graveyard and they tend to clean their grills when I'm there. Also, if  ur banger on the machines like I am, their point system sucks. Better off playing at Dottys up the road and grabbing food from the lodge."}
{"text":"Nice Irish Bar. Food was OK; service time was long. OK for drinks, not a dinner destination in and of itself.  Came in, sat down, was served pretty quickly. Atmosphere is a cross between Irish Pub / Sports Bar. Beers came, then we ordered. Took 30 minutes for food to arrive - a Ruben and some Corned Beef. Too long to wait, in this reviewer's opinion. Food was OK; the Ruben and onion rings was good, the Corned Beef tasted like it was sweetened.   Overall, good place for drinks and bar bites. Dinner - not so much."}
{"text":"Had a long shift crazy shift for Super Bowl and stopped in after... We're been trying different spots in  southern highlands and by far this is the best.... Christin was our bartender the last two trips and could not have been better. Much needed R&R after a crazy day. Great staff at night!!!!"}
{"text":"If you live or stay in the area this place is your best bet for good drinking and good bar food. They're the same company as PT's so expect to find the same food and drink specials. Happy hour is 5-7pm and 12-2am 50% off all drinks and pizza along with $5 appetizer specials. The bar is nice and hidden behind some classy looking office buildings in the one of Las Vegas's nicest residential neighborhoods. The bar tenders are all very friendly and good at pouring drinks. They have a cigar lounge, pool table, shuffle board and plenty of private seating. This is a hidden gem, it's clean and inviting. Not too smokey or loud, just right."}
{"text":"Stopped in for opening last night.  Place was busy but service was spot-on.  PT's Entertainment Group did a good job keeping the Irish theme from the previous business, while adding some of the touches you would expect from the local company we all know.  Shuffle board and pool table additions, as well as a patio area were nice touches.    The one star from the top was for stripping out so much of the traditional Irish tchotchke that adorned the previous place and added tons of character."}
{"text":"First time coming to this bar and I am beyond shocked it only has a 3 star rating. From the second we walked in Erika greeted us, got us our drinks and got us hooked up on the shuffle board in no time! Within the hour of us being here...she has probably checked up on us at least 6-7 times already. I don't even think we've had a second to have an empty glass. She is probably one of the most attentive bartenders I've had in a while!! Her service is wonderful and I would most likely come back and visit her!"}
{"text":"Always a good time! They have everything a good bar needs- cold drinks, good food and shuffleboard! They also have a cigar lounge. Their cornbeef sliders are to die for! Love the garlic wings too! I haven't had anything there I didn't absolutely love (sober too!)"}
{"text":"I've seen this place off of the 15 freeway for years when going to Vegas. Stopped in for the first time today. Super friendly, attentive staff! Great beer and food. The wings were amazing! Bathrooms are very clean too. I would highly recommend stopping in here on your way in/out of Vegas."}
{"text":"Terrible service!!! Food has gone downhill sine Char left. What happens when all of the bartenders and servers are sitting eating and on their phones? Absolutely nothing!!"}
{"text":"When here couple of times for breakfast at 50% off breakfast till 10 AM it was good. The only thing I found there's very few people there in the morning felt like I was alone have a great place to set outside or inside"}
{"text":"First off....it's an Irish pub. The Irish aren't necessarily known for their world class cuisine. With that said though, this place is pretty good. We had the fish & chips and the meatloaf. The meatloaf and potatoes were good but I would skip the peas.  The meatloaf had a unique flavor that I actually liked which is surprisingly since I am a self proclaimed meatloaf expert/snob.   Decent beer collection and a good array of tv's to catch your favorite game.   Check it out."}
{"text":"Reserved the cigar room for my boyfriend birthday and Tracy the Manager was so helpful and sweet! She made it so easy and gave me all the detail and help I needed!"}
{"text":"This is what used to be Molly Malone's. It's now essentially a PT's, but with Irish pub decor. Well, what decor there is anyways. It's rather standard and bland, like a PT's. The beer offerings and menu are just like any other PT's. But it's a nice change from the standard PT's because if you quint your eyes, it kinda almost feels like an Irish pub. All that said, though, it's never really crowded, the noise level is minimal, there's plenty of TVs, and the bartenders are really nice and attentive."}
{"text":"Sean Patrick's Pub is a fantastic place to enjoy well-poured drinks, quality food, and they have an excellent management team.  The environment is clean and inviting. The interior will allow you to feel like you are not in Nevada. There are a lot of Irish appointments and the staff are pleasantly social with their guests.  The Guiness is well-poured and the sliders are very tasty.   The one thing I would like to see upgraded is the bathrooms. The bathrooms were very clean and well stocked though.  This is the perfect location for local residents to enjoy a game, a drink by one of three large fireplaces, or network and mingle with other locals."}
{"text":"Having lived in Southern Highlands for over 10+ years I was surprised to see this place change name, I would only frequent the other place if I was desperate and in the area and it was only \"so so\" to me.  Since it has changed to Sean Patrick's I have been finding myself going back more and more, I like the new stools and the new bar rail (simple stuff like padded bar rails and nice padded seats mean more to me than I thought), the cigar room is nice and even though I do not smoke cigars I can see the attraction to it. I love the 2015 golden tee and the HUGE shuffle board table, the beers are good, nice and cold and the new menu although typical bar food, burgers, wing's and sandwiches the food I have ordered has all been good and HUGE portions. I only go during lunchtime as I work nights but Delores the bartender has always been chatty and nice and very eager to please. Overall I am a new fan, great prices, huge portions of food and good cold beer is a winner in my book."}
{"text":"Great place to watch the football games!  Excellent service and food! The bartenders and wait staff are always friendly.  There is a large window and small patio,  which is a nice change from all of the other bars in town."}
{"text":"Have to give 4 stars because I keep coming back. Can't beat the half-off happy hour on drinks, and there are several friendly and attentive bartenders. I like the chicken fingers and fries, and I enjoyed my half-off breakfast. However, I'm not a fan of the pizza or really anything else I've had from the menu. Pretty good draught selection, including some PT's beer which is locally brewed."}
{"text":"Stopped in soon after the conversion from Molly Malone's. My wife and I had enjoyed eating there regularly. As soon as we walked in, the stench of smoke was so strong that we walked back out. My actual rating is no stars since we did not do anything but walk in and out. We were so disappointed that the 17%  of smokers were considered more important than the other 83% of non-smokers. I thought maybe I was too harsh, but two nights ago while dining at The Lodge (which has a separate eating area from the bar), I overheard people in the next booth saying the same thing. This place is now irrelevant for me. Maybe it will change, but I'm not holding my breath, although if I ever walk in there again I probably will have to."}
{"text":"I go here at least once a week during happy hour for dinner and drinks. They have good food. Good prices. The staff is great. It's the staff that keeps me and my girlfriend coming back. When we go somewhere else we feel like we're cheating on our bartender. Great place to relax."}
{"text":"First time here and we will be back. Great food and amazing service, thanks Tiana. Please Keep the vegetable chicken pita on the menu"}
{"text":"Used to be our favorite place to go on the way in or out of town. Our last visit we went to grab a bite on the way of of town but we sat at the table for a long time and were completely ignored. Wound up walking out and taking our business elsewhere."}
{"text":"I'm sad that this place is not Molly Malone's any more. We ordered take out for the family on St. Patrick's  Day and what a huge disappointment! The corned beef was like shoe leather, the potatoes had zero flavor and were hard as little rocks, the cabbage was just a quarter of a head also without flavor and I don't think it was even cooked! The fish and chips was made with fries out of a frozen bag. And the shepherd's pie was a disappointment too. It came in a tiny soup type container and didn't include any of the sides like Molly's used to have. For the price, it certainly should've included more than it did. Alrhough in our neighborhood, we will not return. Boo!"}
{"text":"This is the friendliest neighborhood bar in vegas... all the staff is awesome!   I came for Monday night football tonight and Kristy and Traci treated me like a king... as always. I honestly feel like I am their favorite patron.  Believe me now and thank me later."}
{"text":"Horrifically understaffed for a Friday evening...and it was a sad bummer to see one of the two people serving 50 people was about 7 months pregnant."}
{"text":"Excellent local bar . Brittney is a great bartender on the day shift.they have Irish cuisine all year long"}
{"text":"I have patronage this place recently over the past several months. Is this place anything special? No, BUT it meets my expectations for an Irish bar. It has a good beer selection, looks like my typical Irish-American pub with the wood decor, and the bar food is good. Service is always tentative here. They have AWESOME bartenders!  Surprisingly, the pizza there is real good; as in I will be ordering it again. Is it a Metro or Grimaldi's? No, but it is thin and crispy with great ingredients which is exactly what I would expect for a good pizza 4/5 stars. It is hard to find good classic pizza around Southern Highlands."}
{"text":"Been coming for a min now and the service only gets worse with each visit. Prices are good but this last time we sat there for 10 minutes waiting while the bar tender chit chatted rather then serving us. Then walks up and says it's not happy hour anymore. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Enjoy coming here to watch a game of football or basketball. They have football food specials. There happy hour is half off on pizzas and drinks. If you like a Ruben try the Sean Patrick's signature pizza. Amazing.  Also try the Sean Patrick's chips, it's their take on Nachos. All their burgers are well cooked and have awesome flavor.  They opened up a new cigar lounge next to the pool table and shuffle board. Its the only PT's bar with a cigar lounge. It's has comfortable seating, two big screen tvs, and 3 humidors filled with cigars. Gets busy during a football game so come early to grab seating in there. Will always recommend Sean Patricks."}
{"text":"the bar is an ideal place for men, especially with cigar smoking. The food is very good and the prices are perfect just a very good place. I will visit it again."}
{"text":"This place was great when Dori and Dolores worked there. They were always attentive and made being there fun even when you never won anything. Since they are gone, we stopped going. The vibe feels stale in there now. We won't be back."}
{"text":"It was a mistake going from Molly Maloney to this god awful place. The food is horrible and it's just another bar that you can find elsewhere with cheaper prices"}
{"text":"I went for lunch. It was pretty empty, though I understand it gets busier at night.   The waitress was great and very attentive and helpful, and the food wasn't bad.   I got the corned beef with potato skins as an appetizer (don't remember what it was called). That was really good.   The sweet potatoes fries were better than you'll find at most places.   The French dip sandwich was just ok. It was no more than a hoagie roll with beef. I would have liked some spices or cheese or something."}
{"text":"Walked right in and walked out. The smell of sewage hit us like a wall as soon as we walked in. I'm pregnant, so I figured it may just be my nose, but my husband noticed right away and we walked out. Also, take the time and respectfully take our flag down. It's shredded and tattered & shouldn't be displayed like that."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time unless you want your time wasted. Inattentive and unintelligent staff. Don't know the difference between boneless wings and nuggets. Calls onion rings onion fires because well they are fried. No attention to detail and no desire to actually wait in the customers. Good luck with that."}
{"text":"Average bar with service that is marginal. They claim to be a cigar bar as well...they sell very few, dry, cheap cigars and the staff knew nothing about them, didn't have a cutter (yes, I had my own but still...) and their \"cigar lounge\" is on the other side of the building. A nice room but getting a server back there took forever. The food isn't bad but for an empty day, it took a long time.  I'd go again...but nothing special. Such a good location but just no moode."}
{"text":"This bar is a hidden gem. It's not a fancy, heels & dress bar, but after a long day at work, sometimes all you want is a cold drink and an awesome bartender. We go in specially to see Ronan, he always takes care of us. No matter how busy it is. I feel like a lot of locals miss out on its suburban location but it's worth a shot. These hometown bars where you're appreciated are few & far between. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Our biggest loss about moving from our old neighborhood is not being able to visit Sean Patrick's! This was our hang out to be able to unwind, have a few drinks, great food and even better friends. We miss this place so much! We came in today and guess what? The staff welcomed us with open arms! Asking us how we were and wanting to catch up! We are home!"}
{"text":"FOOD POISONING!!! Chocolate soup and barfing for about 2 hours last night. I made the mistake of ordering the steak sandwich which was so disgusting it was one of the worst things Ive ever eaten. They say its supposed to have a \"guiness spread\" but just tasted like it was doused in a ton of whole grain mustard. Thats probably to cover up the taste of the rancid meat I was served. I suppose it could have been the side salad but my money is on the sandwich. Started feeling sick before getting to the car. Went and laid down but was up an hour and a half to 2 hours later spewing from both ends. Thankfully I bought a bathroom trash can earlier in the afternoon or it would have been a much bigger mess."}
{"text":"As a visitor from San Diego, I've come twice to this pub. Enjoyed it each time. Atmosphere was friendly, seemed to be a neighborhood place. Staff was very accommodating and attentive.  Food under the supervision of Chef Char is not disappointing,very tasty with good potions. 4 stars only because I  can not bring my grandkids who I'm visiting to lunch,here (21 and over place)."}
{"text":"Awesome bar! Great food and fun people that work there. Its a nice place to go have drinks and watch the football game."}
{"text":"Awesome place to chill!  Great happy hour deals.  Melanie kills it late night and is one hot tamale!!!  Golden tee and plenty of TVs."}
{"text":"Cute place and convenient in the Highlands suburban sprawl. The first time I ate here I was moderately impressed- I had the Reuben skins appetizer and it was very good. I love all things Reubenesque, so that was a must try! It was a good appetizer but needs a little more flavor.  My dining partner had the pot stickers, and that plate presentation was show worthy! A mountain of cole slaw held the pot stickers, and siracha was painted onto the plate. This was a very good appetizer also.   The decor is Irish/typical poker bar and there is plenty of seating throughout. Our server was quite friendly and helpful throughout our visit. They had football specials ($3 select drafts, $3 select shots) even though it wasn't a game night- who does that?? The menu has lots of promise and I plan to return to try a few other items."}
