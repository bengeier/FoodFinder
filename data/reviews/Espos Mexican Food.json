{"text":"Cheesy quesadillas. Crunchy tacos with fresh ingredients. Delicious enchiladas. Huge burritos. Fresh pico. Fantastic salsa! Excellent Chimichangas...and the best seasoned rice in these here parts.  Only two suggestions. Get it to go, especially in the warmer 8 months of the year; and tell them easy on the salt, especially for beef products.    What? You're still here reading this? Why? Get out of here and get your *** to Espos Stat!     T"}
{"text":"Feel look and taste  authentic. Ordered the green tamale plate as I only eat organic meat and I don't want to get weird looks if I'll ask as it's probably not organic. 2 tamales so packed some of it to go! Will come back again with husband and friends sometimes. I liked it!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit; a continuance of my quest to find the best shredded beef tacos known to man.  I did not find what I was looking for, but I did find a passable back up to tide me over until I do.   The shredded beef was not bad, but the taco shells were not like homemade...very disappointing. The refried beans were a little salty, and watery, but did not taste horrible.  The rice was quite good.   The wait was very long, but the counter girl was very nice, and warned me in advance. She also gave me a free soda for my troubles.  I was very pleased with how I was treated, and plan to go back and try some other menu items."}
{"text":"BEST AUTHENTIC MEXICAN FOOD!!! I can't say enough great things about Espos. My family and I have been enjoying their food for 10+ years. My co-workers and I frequently have lunch here. The tamales around the holidays are perfect, order ahead of time if you can. We love the chorizo, machaca beef and anything with green chili. Never disappointed. I'm salivating just writing this post ... Espos, here I come!"}
{"text":"This food is awesome, great customer service, just wish the market was still open next door, need a good carneceria close.  Would love it if they made a queso fundido dip, because like all the food, it would be out of sight!"}
{"text":"Love the food here. I strongly recommend the green sauce. My favorites are the green chili beef burro or machaca burro, enchilada style with the green sauce. Taco Tuesday is great also."}
{"text":"I was so excited that Espos was back.  I have been back three times since they had their grand opening.  Very disappointed.  Thought I would give them one last try.  I ordered their grilled chicken taco and their carnitas taco to go.  Got them home and opened them up.  I would not even give it to my dog.  They have done a lot in cleaning up the place, but the food does not compare to what it was like before they closed.  Would not recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Glad to see Espo's back in business. I never understood their closing given the constant flow of patrons. I had my usual machaca beef enchilada combo with rice and beans. The main difference is that the combo used to include a ground beef taco but now that costs extra. There were fewer rice and beans as well. I don't remember the previous price but the new price is $8.15. The menu is now on the wall and there were no handheld menus. When the line gets long it will be difficult for people to read the menu on the wall.  Still...the food is great.  Welcome back."}
{"text":"OMG! I ate their Green Chile Plate and it was really delicious. Their food is great and their service it too. 10 outta 10 would eat there again"}
{"text":"Finally re opened and the green chile is just as delicious as ever! ! So happy espos is back!  Yum!"}
{"text":"Just finished the whitest Mexican food in AZ. If you think white bread is too spicy and flavorful then this place is for you. Chips were stale with no salt, guac had no onion, tomatoes or flavor of any kind. Enchiladas were chicken cube burritos swimming in sauce. Sucks because it looks like a cute little place with nice patio but would not come back"}
{"text":"Incredibly blown away by this place. My husband and I might have found our new Taco Tuesday hang out. They have a DJ every Tuesday, they also do 10$ buckets of beer, 2$ margs, 2$ rumchata, and 2$ beers. Besides a great happy hour (or happy day if it's Tuesday) The atmosphere alone is worth dropping by. We got a bucket of beer (6 beers) 3 tacos, and chips and salsa for under 20$. Were still sitting here and planning on stay for quite awhile. There are lots of families with little ones as well as a drinking crowd. The bartender was incredibly friendly as was all the staff. You can tell they really enjoy working here. It feels like we're on Sandy Beach in Rocky Pointe, Mexico and I loooove it! Thank you Espos for an amazing Taco Tuesday!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been coming here for 25 years. It's nice having a neighborhood joint where the owner knows our names. We raised our son at Espo's! Love the red chili plate and Taco Tuesday."}
{"text":"So I have been here twice. The first time I had the green chile burrito and my wife had the taco salad. The burrito was amazing. The flavor was so good and my wife loved the taco salad. The second time my wife had the taco salad again and loved it but I had the beef enchiladas plate.  The flavor was excellent but I think they had it already prepared in the oven and the bottom was burnt. Still good with the burnt flavor but I would have preferred it not to be burnt on the bottom."}
{"text":"Espo has the best Mexican food in town.  We have been eating there over the past 20 years weekly."}
{"text":"This mexican food is amazing.  They are always on top of their game.  I enjoy taking friends there and enjoying some great comfort food when I have some spare time to get out of the shop.  My favorite is the taco burrito. It is ashamed that the old partner will not allow the phone number to change or release this account to the other partner they split with as to convenience the customers to call direct from YELP.  BOO! on the previous ex partner keeping this yelp account hostage."}
{"text":"Ordered Green Chile Burro,Enchilada Style. Great Flavor, spicy and nice size Burro. Good value for price. Went at Lunch hour and line moved fast and received order within a few minutes.  Nice outside patio as well and was very clean.  Will return to try other food items."}
{"text":"I've waited for some good Mexican for 5-months, boy was it worth it! I missed tasty Mexican food and Arizona is one place to find it. My sister took me here; I wanted some place with that, hole-in-the-wall feel, nothing too fancy and affordable.   I ordered the Veggie Burrito enchilada style with Red Sauce. It was yummy! Also, I did mention to my sister, \"it's a little salty,\" but I didn't mind it. We also ordered the guac and salsa chips. Guac was creamy and exquisite!   I would definitely come back here again!"}
{"text":"Great flavors!  Excellent Mexican food - Nice to get some authentic rice and beans with meats prepared with amazing Mexican flavors."}
{"text":"Delicious chile relleno!! Great prices, comfortable easy vibe. Great for a quick meal but not fast food."}
{"text":"I am not a die-hard Espo's fan, there for my review is unbiased. Tonight I tried their chicken enchiladas plate with green sauce. the sauce was delicious and had a kick to it. But there didnt seem to be enough chicken in the enchilada. As others have said, the chicken is cubed not shredded.  I also had a churro, this one had too much cinnamon and hardly any sugar. Blehh. Rubios serves better churros."}
{"text":"Its authentic, it's reasonable, it's delicious and i wish i was living near by so i could come to eat her twoce a week"}
{"text":"When I can't drive 2hrs to Globe, Az. for my favorite mexican food Espo's is my second favorite. I order the taco burritos (enchilada style) and cheese enchiladas (red) every time I go. Their red salsa is the bomb too!  Side note: If you ever want the best mexican food you have ever had in your entire life you must visit Globe Az. You can go to any sit down restaurant there however Guayos On the Trail is the absolute best. The mexican food in Globe is so good it has a whole facebook page dedicated to it."}
{"text":"Absolutely AMAZING!!!! They catered my daughters wedding and my sons funeral. Best authentic Mexican food ever. Try either the red or green chile burritos. All beef or chicken tacos. Been going there since 1989."}
{"text":"So Good! This is a great place to take a family.The prices are very reasonable,the servings are large,and the food is delicious.My children love the food and my husband(he's a country boy from the south of Georgia) doesn't care for mexican food,but he loves Espos.The service was quick,the food was hot and the restaurant was spotless(including the bathroom!).The gentleman that took our order was very nice and had a great sense of humor.We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I LOVED THIS PLACE! The food was so good and the service was great too. Great Horchata! Great Tacos Great Carne Tacos OMG Yummy enchiladas  Rice was delicious beans were just okay  overall I am a fan!"}
{"text":"Espos catered my sons first birthday and the food was GREAT!! Everyone loved it Leon the owner was wonderful to work with.   I will definitely use them again I'm a customer for life!!!  Leon worked with me called me back responded to my text right away if I had any questions!   I'm referring everyone to Espos!   I love supporting locally owned businesses!"}
{"text":"This quaint little diner makes you feel like you're in Mexico.....nuthin fancy, no frills, just some of the best Mexican you'll find in the Valley! Very friendly staff and you'll leave knowing that you paid for some great eats and not a dozen flat screen TV's pasted on every wall."}
{"text":"It's very satisfying. It's not the best Mexican, but its definitely tasty and worth stopping if you are in the area.   Quesadillas are HUGE. Be prepared."}
{"text":"Great little restaurant. Tamales and tacos are very good. It was our first time there so the lady behind the counter gave us some samples of the different meats they have. Prices are very reasonable.  Will definitely stop by here again!"}
{"text":"A little restaurant at McClintock and chandler, their chimichanga plate is really really good. The chips is alright, could be better that's the only reason I'm giving 4 stars. Staff is nice and the place is not crowded good for conversations. I'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"Great Little Mexican spot! The green Chili is awesome! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Delicious! Best Taco Tuesday deal I've seen in town! The tacos are filled generously with meat. We ordered the 10 tacos for $10 and got steak and shredded beef and the meat was great quality. Not rubbery meat at all like some other places. The meat was perfectly seasoned. My daughter ordered a tostada and it was huge! The taco bar full of salsas had a great selection and they were ALL delicious. I was worried about a packed house and that the food would take long, but they were speedy and had great, friendly service! :) We shared a table with a nice man from North Carolina. Nice patio seating with a friendly DJ and some good Cumbia music. Great atmosphere and I really can't wait to come back to taste the rest of their menu! Thank you Espos!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I must say this place is legit! I got the carne asada burrito and added guacamole and cheese. They did not add the cheese that I paid for, but the quality of the food was excellent. This is the reason for the 4/5 stars. Had they put the cheese on I would have easily given them 5 stars. Burrito, additions and a medium drink was $10 on a Friday. They have specials.... like Taco Tuesday... I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Great for Taco Tuesdays!!! Salsa bar is amazing! A+ for customer service!"}
{"text":"Probably some of the worst Mexican food I've ever had.  I had the Carne asada burrito and it was tasteless and dry. My friend had pork carnitas and it had no flavor either.    On top of bad food, we had to wait for 40 minutes for it.  We're from out of town here for spring training  and came here based on the good reviews this place had.  Maybe we came on an off night, but I'd never go back here."}
{"text":"Was pretty excited when we were just driving down the street and saw this fantastic looking place with lots of folks coming and going.  We quickly made a u turn and came back.  Yelp reviews were good so I walked in first to see and plates in the tables that looked yummy!  The cashier was lovely but looked overworked but still she was very nice.  Ordered chicken taco salad, green chili burrito chimi and a machaca chile enchilada style.  One chili came plain and not enchilada style when I took it back the gal that came to take it back seemed annoyed .  minutes later she came and tossed the the tray back over the small counter with horrible look at me.  The tray had cheese all over before I could think of snapping a pic I had gathered it up on my tray.  But here's a pic anyways.  Now the plate looked good but the meat in both was super salty!    Had it not been for the rice and beans and sour cream it would have been unedible.  Portions were a healthy size and rice and beans delicious but the service lousy.   Maybe it was too late in Sunday to visit. Idk but I'll pass next time."}
{"text":"Probably the best Mexican... Sonoran food you can get in the east valley. Real deal real good."}
{"text":"VERY delicious food (and horchata!), but the dishes tend to be heavily salted...more than is necessary for Mexican food. Be prepared to drink a ton of water afterwards!"}
{"text":"Hands down THE BEST Mexican food in town.  If you want great food  and quick service- come here! Taco Tuesday - get here early and fill yer belly.  10 street taco (carnitas) for $10.99. I will always come back here when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Food was great!... I had the carnitas plate but what I really recommend is their chile verde. They gave me a free sample after asking for salsa verde, which they don't seem to have, but that sample was fiiire!"}
{"text":"Great customer service! Cute place with a big patio. Good tacos, and loved the rice and beans. They also had a few beer options, and premade margaritas. Only complaint would be that I was expecting real, traditional crispy shells coming from a more authentic place. Otherwise would recommend this little hidden gem in Chandler!"}
{"text":"Paid $10 for an egg, potato, and green chile beef burrito, enchilada style red, with a fountain drink. My meal was so-so,  I enjoyed the spiciness of the green chile.   The customer service was not good. The girl behind the counter was on the phone, hung up, and didn't acknowledge me for about 2 minutes while she input a phone order. When my meal came out she must have whispered my order number because my food was just sitting there, waiting for me. It was clean inside.  Bottom line: There are better Mexican food options within a five mile radius. Rositas's, Burrito Express, Elmers, Amado's, Cafe Rio, etc. Go a little further and try Los Taquitos or Burrito Company. I won't be back to Espo's."}
{"text":"Screwed..... literally..  First off I love eating at Espos and have been for many years. This review is not meant to bash them but to make others aware of what happened to me. The food itself is actually one of my go to for takeout Mexican food.   On Friday November 24th my family was over so we ended up ordering takeout from Espos which equated to about 8 plates of food with chips and salsa.   Everything tasted great as usual from Espos. We were not able to finish all the food and a untouched beef Enchilada combo plate was left over. I decided to take the untouched combo plate for lunch at work on Monday. During lunch break when I was about to take my second bite. I noticed a large screw inside the shredded beef. No joke pictures below.   I was not upset but concerned for others chipping teeth on metal. I contacted Espos and the female on the other end said they were missing several screws from a device used to cook or slice tomatoes. After describing the screw she apologized to me and offered free food. My goal wasn't to get free food and frankly was not hungry for Espos at that time.   I wanted to warn them about the metal and potential injury to customers. Sounded like they were aware of missing metal screws and she told me it was not just one screw but several.   In talking to the female at Espos I asked her if she wanted me to bring the screw in. She said she would really like that. The next day I took it to the restaurant and asked for the manager. The female cashier said the manager was busy and I showed her the screw. This was the same employee I spoke to over the phone and  told me the manger was upset and never took down my name or any information.   Even though I love the food it's disappointing that it happened."}
{"text":"Glad they reopened as well. Just a little too salty on the Chicken Enchiladas but everything else was great."}
{"text":"If your ever in Chandler and Happen to notice this little Mexican Restaurant on the SE Corner of McClintock and Chandler Blvd, please try them out.  This place was recommended to me today and we tried them out and its Fantastic!  It may not look like one of these corporate chain restaurants on the outside or inside, but what they serve Taste Really Great with lots of Flavor!  You can dine inside or out on their Patio.  I noticed they recently applied for a Liquor License (sign posted), so I'm not sure if they served now or not."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb. If you're getting Mexican food in Chandler this has to be the best choice hands down. Look no further."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the food in this place! It feels authentic and makes me feel like I'm in Mexico! This has got to be the best Mexican foot restaurant in the area, hands down! The downside to this,though, is the crowded building and extremely long waits. The place is compact because everyone loves it so much ! You know, they should definitely expand on their restaurant and it would be an easy 5/5 in my book!"}
{"text":"I want to put infinity stars this place is amazing I could live here I totally recommend the beef tacos or the enchiladas great service too so fast"}
{"text":"The green chili beef is delicious! The red chili not good to me. And the salsa just bad and too much heat! Hopefully they have salsa verde I can try next time. The beans were bland, rice was really good though.  And I have no idea where the restroom is! I never did find it! I will definitely go back for the green chili beef to go :)"}
{"text":"Stopped by today and we were pleasantly surprised by this delicious food! We tried the tacos and the enchiladas. The queso dip was really good too. We will be back."}
{"text":"Love this joint! Great burritos and their tacos Tuesday's are amazing! Our to go Mexican restaurant- we love their rice, beans, salsa.. Actually we love everything! Make sure to try their el presidente burrito!"}
{"text":"I thought it was OK. Nothing special. The chips were lame and the guacamole was boring. I had a carnita burrito that was basically just a bunch of pretty good tasting pork stuffed in a wrap that got soggy from all the juice. Wife got a grilled chicken chimichanga and said it was plain with little flavor."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Espo's in 10 years and they used to be a staple. I'd heard they got expensive but figured I'd give them the benefit of the doubt. My order of red chili burro enchilada style, side of beans and a fountain drink cost me $12.70!  Why does a hole in the wall (yet tasty) Mexican restaurant charge so much??? Thankfully I skipped the $2.99 side of chips and salsa.  I'll go back to Someburros when that same meal would be under $9 and include chips and salsa.   Someburros folks- I'm sorry to hate on 'ya but your too expensive..."}
{"text":"Mixed.  Fantastic lunch (green chili burrito) but merely \"good\" dinner.  Nevertheless, I loved this place and will return."}
{"text":"Great somewhat hidden gem in the greater Pheonix area. Espos has fantastic, home cooked Mexican food. Try, it's delicious!"}
{"text":"Possibly the best Green Chili in town! This place has had it's ups and downs, but it is great right now!"}
{"text":"A hole in the wall that is EXACTLY how you want a hole in the wall to be. Great food! Good price. A few tables inside, a few tables outside and people everywhere. I threw them a softball and ordered the cheese enchilada plate and it hit the spot. The only thing missing is a nap. I'll be back. I'll probably be a regular. I have to come for taco Tuesday. It was drawing quite a crowd."}
{"text":"Great!  I enjoy mexican food.  I especially search for places that are NOT chain places.   The mom and pop places usually have more authentic tastes.   This is one of those small but tasty places.   I will be back over and over.  I remember Espo's as a grocery.   McClintock was a 2 lane cement road and the road Espo's was on was Williams Field Rd., 2 lanes and in the country."}
{"text":"Always a great experience eat in or to go.  Try Taco Tuesdays for their Street taco specials.   The service is friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"The Green and Red Chili Quesadilla is awesome, it's a great place to go on my lunch break. It's much better quality food than a Filabertos or Los Favs."}
{"text":"Been a family favorite since I was 12 and walked there to get a giant delicious bean and cheese burrito at least once a week. Now I actually have dreams about the green chili! AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Incredible food and incredible service! We were unsure which meat to order and they gave us samples to try each!!! They were all really amazing. I got he chimichanga- it's huge and delicious. I wouldn't suggest getting guac though, that was just eh."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Arizona!!! I've lived in the valley for over a decade and have never really found a great spot for Mexican food, until now. I had a shredded beef burrito smothered in delicious green chili and melty cheese, with a side of Christmas. The burrito had lots of flavor, the perfect amount of spice, and left me feeling completely satisfied. My new favorite place. I definitely suggest you try it!"}
{"text":"Not sure what all the hype is about.  I have now gone 3 times and each time, I have been disappointed.  The first time I went, I had a carne asada taco that while flavorful fell apart because it did not have a very substantial tortilla.  And what they call flautas are what everybody else calls taquitos-nothing special here.  On the second occasion, I went for Taco Tuesday.  Upon entering, there were two people ahead of me and I noticed that all the employees were eating lunch.  Not one person bothered to get up and take the orders. We had to wait  a good 5 minutes until the girl was done playing with her cell phone to order.  I ordered a ground beef taco and when it arrived, I saw that they didnt even put lettuce or tomato in it.  It was simply ground beef in a tortilla-that's it.  There was a salsa bar but I was not too impressed with the flavors of the salsas.  My other tacos were alright-nothing amazing.  On the third occasion, I ordered a beef machaca chimichanga.  While it came with sour cream and cheese, they didn't even bother to melt the cheese on the chimichanga.  I honestly have had better chimichangas at Garcia's-which pains me to say.  Oh, I also had big chunks of gristle in the meat. Yuck. Yuck . Yuck !  A shining gem?  Give me a break."}
{"text":"I love this place. The atmosphere is casual but hip and full of old school charm at the same time. I'm a standard bean and cheese burro girl loaded up with hot sauce but omg their tamales are to die for. If you're not big on spicy food  order your sauces on the side because they don't shy away from heat here. I've never been here when the place wasn't packed- so much better than your average bland commercial restaurant chain Mexican fare"}
{"text":"Sooooo good and great prices! We had the el jefe and the green chile burritos, enchilada style. They were so flavorful, and a little spicy! Plus you can get them Christmas style. I would definitely go back, and I can't wait to try more!"}
{"text":"Espos is a Chandler staple that has returned with vengeance. The newly remodeled restaurant is clean and open yet authentic to the original building and design.   The food is always amazing and has that homemade feel that makes you feel all warm inside. It is a bit expensive compared to comparable Mexican restaurants in the area but you get what you pay for. Healthy portions and fresh ingredients will keep you coming back.   Also, they have red cream soda tap, which is rare to see and boy is it tasty.  If you have never been, you really are missing out."}
{"text":"We walked in it smelled good then we sat down to eat and my hubby found a long hair in his salsa ughhh."}
{"text":"Hidden gem. Fantastic, homemade Mexican food. Friendly and fun atmosphere. There isn't a thing on the menu I wouldn't recommend!"}
{"text":"My spouse and a friend went to Espo's for the first time. We have lived in the area for years and have not taken the time to visit. We have been missing out! The outside patio is inviting while inside, the line is continuous with many regular customers. I had two tacos, one shredded chicken and one shredded beef. They came with fluffy flour and corn tortillas respectively. The chicken was juicy and flavorful and the salsa was a wonderful blend of spices. It packed some heat. The beef was also juicy and flavorful and the pico on top had diced jalepenos, which added substantial heat. I would ask for no pico next time. The meat on both could have been drained a little better. Spouse had an egg and chorizo burrito - all day breakfast FTW- and said it was a nice blend of proteins and spicy goodness. We are sad that we just now visited this gem and will definitely return!"}
{"text":"We had a blast eating at Esposito! The patio had a DJ and the food was terrific! We will surely go back!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to do this for awhile..  Upon moving to Arizona, the one thing I was looking forward to was endless amounts of Mexican food.  Thank goodness one of my coworkers suggested Espos.  Family owned for a number of years, everyone is always so welcoming each and every time I go.  I've had the street tacos on tuesdays (the place is bouncing every week), enchiladas, burritos, and taco salad.  Never had a bad experience/meal at this establishment.  Keep up the good work :)"}
{"text":"Awesome Mexican food.  It was open for 40 years before the landlord made them move and now they are finally back.  Check out the breakfast burrito with potato.  Doesn't get much better.  Not as fast as other Mexican places but it's easily worth the wait."}
{"text":"Unfortunately not nearly as good as Rosita's near the airport. Got the carne asada burrito. Beef was dry and their salsa wasn't my favorite. Good thing is it is cheap for a decent size burrito. Might go back to try the carnitas but maybe not."}
{"text":"3 out of 3 new Mexicans in the group agree it's good.  Best Mexican food place I've tried in the Phoenix area so far.  Couldn't find anything that could replace the southern new Mexico that I'm used to"}
{"text":"So to my knowledge there is no lard in the beans, and I can tell you those alone are yummy. It's not a Vegan hot spot or anything, but I really loved their taco Tuesday with cheap margaritas, and they had a dope salsa bar on taco Tuesday. I easily turned my bean burrito into something substantial. I hope to know if the rice is Vegan, that way I can get more of a complete meal here."}
{"text":"WOW!! This place is incredible. We've been in Arizona 16 years. We moved from NM, a place where Mexican food is hard to beat. This place is our new favorite!! My husband had the Chicken Burrito Enchilada Style and I had the El Jeffe. Both were mouth watering awesome!! Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Excellent!!! The lady who took my order was nice. I ordered a red enchilada plate that had beans and rice with it. They have this really good mango juice that looks homemade that's really good too.  The guacamole was slamming! They give you a lot of food. I think I only paid $16 for all of that. Had enough to eat off of for two days. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I'm torn....food is awesome so that's a 5 for me. Place overall is also a 4.5. But taco Tuesday  I'm convinced they have a DJ there just to keep people from staying too long as it gets packed. It's a nice patio area, small, and LOUD music. DJ playing club music and you've gotta tell to talk. I don't know what they're going for there....party scene? It just doesn't jive with the rest. I like the food but taco Tuesday is to-go only."}
{"text":"This is our absolute favorite place to get Mexican food in the Phoenix area and it's a must on our itinerary whenever we have out of town guests. The carne asada is always perfectly cooked and their margaritas never disappoint. If you're looking for a real treat, go on a Tuesday. They have a salsa bar, a bar outside serving drinks, and live music"}
{"text":"Found this by just searching when in the area. Very good std Mexican fare. More tacos and burritos than plates. Will be back."}
{"text":"One word, delicious. Pretty expensive, paid $20 for 10 rolled tacos, medium drink and a side of rice. Rolled tacos come with a heaping amount of lettuce on top, next time I will ask for it with none. Overall good experience. Friendly staff. We sat on the porch and enjoyed the beautiful weather. Busy place, waited about 20-25 mins for our food but was hot and tasty when it came out."}
{"text":"Totally regretting the last four years of my life because I've lived right down the street from this place and never stopped in until today. By far the BEST Mexican food in the valley!!! I missed taco Tuesday by a day, but I'll definitely be waiting at the door for them to open next week!! The machaca burrito with red and green sauce was to die for as were the tacos we ate. The icing on the heavenly cake was that they sell FLOUR TORTILLA CHIPS!!!!! Life doesn't get much better than this!!"}
{"text":"Just ok, definitely not the best around. The green chile beef is very tasty, nice amount of heat. With that being said the burrito was only green chile beef and was basically like soup encased in a tortilla. Very difficult to eat as liquid hot magma seeps out every time you take a bite."}
{"text":"Awesome burros and enchiladas. I've been coming here for years. The staff and food are great. You must try the red enchilada sauce!"}
{"text":"My neighbors eat here often and recommended it for over a year.  Today we finally stopped.  We orders enchiladas, taco, tostada, chips and chirps to taste a bit of everything.  Price per person: average $10  Meals:  served with Refried beans and rice and topped with light lettuce and tomatoes Service: order at cashier Food quality:  score 4 out of 5 as the ground beef was very greasy and the tortillas shells cooked were mushy and burned on the bottom.  I was given a replacement meal for the burnt bottom.  A few things to consider:  - The rice has tomatoes and onions for those who are subject to fussy. - ground beef is relatively greasy \"but\" flavored well. - Red salsa is basically HOT sauce and I was not able to eat any of it. - Green chili (sauce for meals choice) was mild to most but still spicy for me, you can ask for light or on the side. - Excellent $2 margaritas. - if you want extra containers to take stuff home there may be a charge. - bathrooms are outside and unisex. - probably can't go wrong with taco Tuesdays.  Over all I think it's a good \"find\" and has something to please everyone, even me who can do spicy."}
{"text":"All I can say is amazing! We had the green chili burritos. We will for sure eat here when we visit Phoenix area again."}
{"text":"Probably the saltiest food we have ever eaten. Not sure what happened here but the hot horchata was good. Two stars for the overage of salt and the fact it was more expensive than my family of six eating at The Spaghetti Factory the night before."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Authentic Mexican Food.     Came here 2yrs ago and forgot to BM it, found it be accident today and so  happy to be here again.    Food is fresh with great flavor, freshly made traditional drinks.   No frills or even flatware, but all you need is plastic ware paper place for this local spot.    Would recommend to everyone visiting Chandler, AZ."}
{"text":"Love this place great food fresh ingredients! I have had anything yet that wasn't great! And I keep going back to try more and different things on the menu!!! Oh yeah Taco Tuesday you gotta try that!!"}
{"text":"Yum.  Seriously if you are having a bad day grab dinner here and you will forget all of your problems."}
{"text":"OMG. YUM.   One of the best Green Chile burritos I've had.   I tried Espos for the first time today. I work about 10 mins. away. I thought let me grab quick grub and head back to my office. I will be silly to think I can do that again.   Espos definitely deserves the long business lines because the food is just darn good! I went at about 5:30p, seen the small parking lot was full (additional parking in the dirt behind the concrete parking lot). Walked in and was greeted by a line of hungry people who know good grub. The cashier was very fast! So I got threw the line in about 5 mins (where the heck do you get that!?). Soon enough, my number was called after about a 10 min. wait.   I wouldn't say this is the best place for brining a large group. The place is cozy size - but it's a new favorite spot for food to-go."}
{"text":"Hands down best burrito shop in AZ. These guys even make their own chips and give you a choice of flour or corn."}
{"text":"Yum!  Was here for the busy lunch time and food came out quickly and was great!  My parents first took me here when I was young  and I take my sons here. Cheese and flour Chips are my fave!"}
{"text":"It's a genuine Mexican restaurant.  If you are looking for good Mexican food, please come here.  I'm not afraid to admit I am a VERY frequent diner.  I'm close to trying everything on the menu.  Their quesadillas are a very nice size perfect for sharing if you are not very hungry or if you want leftovers.  The meet is perfectly cooked and the spices and salsa defiantly have a kick but not overpowering."}
{"text":"Food is great! Beer is cold. Patio is nice during cooler evening months. Fast friendly service."}
{"text":"OKKKKKKK!!!!! I just can't, this place, after moving to AZ from CA was the first and best experience that I had, soooooo impressive, the food is amazing, the Tuesday $2 Marggie's and 10 for 10 tacos...I just can't, The people are really nice and the place is great indoors and out...I Love, Love, Love!!!! Keep it up, don't ever want to lose you!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Taco Tuesday is awesome.  Love their tamale plate especially. I go here every month."}
{"text":"This place is a gem.  It's kind of an awkward location and I wish they had a drive thru but it's worth the trouble to park and go in..  They serve beer too.  This place is the real deal."}
{"text":"Been to this place a bunch of times and I have never been disappointed! They have the best tamales and their espos salsa is amazing! The staff is very friendly and I am glad they are still in business!"}
{"text":"This place is super trendy/popular! Very crowded, hardly any place to sit. I would recommend take-out instead of dine-in."}
{"text":"This is the best mexican food in town!!!! Love their green chili beef quesadilla! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great food and amazing flavor! Lots of great salsas and condiments to make your food taste exactly how you want it. I got chicken tacos that in itself was perfect!  Tip: Patience. I was the first person through the door on a Sunday with a crowd filing in right behind me.The cashier is usually one person with a bunch of kitchen crew working hard. The food is worth the wait."}
{"text":"really like the chicken burrito, stuffed full of chicken and only chicken. The recent remodel job on the restaurant and the patio is a great improvement and the food still remains excellent."}
{"text":"Great food, atmosphere, and service. This place is always busy and parking is good. Espos was featured locally and national Bally and does not disappoint--authentic food and prices."}
{"text":"Espos helped us out in a pinch! We had a retirement party; a hungry staff and a caterer that cancelled. In under an hour, they got us 25 tacos, enough quesadillas for a staff of ten as well as churros for all! Thank you so much for the delicious food and wonderful customer service. You definitely have return customers. Thank you for saving the day!"}
{"text":"A mainstay of old small town Chandler,more of an older style of Mexican cooking. Good, but a bit too much residual oil on food. Will stain your take out bag too much oil."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a very long time. I've known about it for years and just never seem to get here. Today we drove by here on our way to Cheesecake Factory and decided to make a 'u'y. Today is the day to try this place! The portions were very large and price seemed to be of good value. I had guacamole added to my chicken a la carte tostada and they piled it on. It tasted homemade and was good. As far as what my bf ordered, he said it was average, though again, large portions. The hot sauce was a little hot for my liking, but I'm somewhat of a hot sauce whimp!!  I would probably come back to try one of the salads. It was a fun relaxed environment and provided outside seating. Nothing fancy. The staff was friendly and I liked the antique decor. They do not have a wait staff...it is order and pick up."}
{"text":"Ok, I have been hard on food here in Arizona. I want red chile! I know that for the most part I can't get what I was used to in Albuquerque, but please, can't anyone come close? hahaha. YES! This place has a best red chile beef burrito. It is marinated shredded beef. The tortillas are thin. The tortillas are still good enough to contain all this chile goodness. I don't think it even comes with cheese! It is so good. Brad has ordered other things and really likes their tacos. The tacos are loaded with cilantro, which to me tastes like soap, but he likes those tacos. Tables can be hard to find on the weekend and in the evenings. In the fall the patio is great to sit and enjoy the weather. Prices are reasonable too."}
{"text":"I think that the big hit about this place is their salsa bar. To my opinion a little overrated. Food was good but I've had equally good food with better service in other places. Not impressed, not on my must go back place."}
{"text":"OMG - just tried this place and we ordered a quesadilla, red tamale and a couple tacos and it all came out in less than 5 minutes and was amazing!"}
{"text":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place. The food is just so good. You can't go wrong with anything. One of my favorite things is that they have flour tortilla chips! These are my favorite and I don't know why more people don't do them. YUM. I am also a big fan of their taco plate. Chicken, pork, beef whatever filling you get you can't go wrong. Have also sampled their burritos and again you just can't go wrong. Portions are huge so you will leave stuffed."}
{"text":"One star for customer service. Every employee I encountered was very pleasant and efficient considering the line of people ordering/waiting for orders.     But I'm not sure if I ate at the same place as all the 5 star rave reviews on here. Wife and I had carnitas enchiladas (2 little sad enchiladas drenched in red flavorless sauce with a little handlful of shredded iceberg thrown on it),veggie burrito, again flavorless, side order of chips (every other chip I bit into was soggy/stale) and the most flavorless guacamole we've ever had. We took the leftovers home thinking maybe the flavors would intermingle and be more evident the next day......nope still bland and lacking taste. I know I know, some of you are probably saying \"oh well you're probably a smoker and your taste buds are shot.\" Nope, have never smoked a day in my life.     Cute atmosphere and pleasant staff but this was our 1st and last trip, food tasted literally like nothing. But they must be making some people happy as the line was out the door. Prices weren't terrible for amount you get......but dang, my taste buds were sad heading home."}
{"text":"Awesome food, fresh, big portions - exactly as it should b.   Highly recommended.   Carne Saada chimichanga was very good !"}
{"text":"Espoo was awesome today! Food was hot. Staff was friendly. Place was clean. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I can't believe how many years I've driven past this restaurant and have just kept going.  Well, we finally gave into the curiosity and stopped in.  First and foremost, the outside seating area is very comfortable, even though it's right next to Chandler Boulevard.  The inside is very unassuming and kind of what I thought it would be looking at it from the outside.  The ONLY challenge I've had with this awesome place is sometimes the tables are rather sticky. Other than that the place is immaculate.  My wife is a fan of the chicken enchiladas, and so far, I've tried everything \"chime style\"...chicken, chili (red & green) and Carne Asada (my favorite so far).  This is one of those go up to the counter and order kind of places, and if you time it just right you'll miss the crowds...and it does get crowded seemingly out of nowhere.  The service is fast, the pricing is very reasonable and the staff are all very friendly.  Salsa (red) is decent but maybe a little too much oregano for my taste, but the green salsa is really good!  Taco Tuesday has the best hand made tortillas as well.  I highly recommend this place and once you eat there, you will too!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a Saturday around 11:45.  Pretty packed too but it didn't take long for our food.  I ordered the taco burrito, ground beef cheese and lettuce wrapped in a tortilla.  Pretty good for the most part. My husband had the enchilada platter that was pretty tasty. I love the homemade Mexican rice and beans.  Next time I want to try the taco salad or a chimichanga.   I saw a couple of those orders go out while I was there and they looked pretty tasty.  Prices here are good and the salsa is pretty awesome too.  Nice staff and clean restaurant with lots of outdoor and indoor seating."}
{"text":"Picked up a half dozen red tamales today. My boy and I killed them during lunch  they were delicious!"}
{"text":"Place is good great taco Tuesday!!!!! You have to get the ten of ten!!!! I really like the steak!!!! I could eat here every week! Salsa bar was really good!!!"}
{"text":"Love the gigantic portion sizes and ability to customize my burrito!! Went there for the first time last week and ordered a carnitas burrito with rice, guac, sour cream and cheese and only paid $7! That is a steal - especially for the portion size. I cannot wait to go there again! New fav!"}
{"text":"Espos is outstanding.  After relocating to Arizona we were puzzled that we could not find the quality of Mexican food that we expected...  Espos broke that streak: HUGE portions made just the way you like them.  My family tends to go light on the vegetable content of their tacos and burritos and Espos naturally goes heavy on the meat/protein.  We just found another great Mexican place that we also love, but before that Espos was the ONLY place that came to mind when we wanted Mexican food in Chandler!!"}
{"text":"This place far exceeded my expectations to what in Mexican food supposed to come out of Chandler, AZ. The place was really clean, not your average hole in the wall that surroundings hurt the eyes. Helpful staff as well.   Now the food... Let me tell you, I got the shredded red chili burrito, deep fried, enchilada style. If you want to experience heaven early, without the whole dying part; taking a bite of my burrito had to feel the same! Lol rice was mediocre but not dry like most places, and refried beans, well are refried beans. Hard to mess those up lol  To top it all off... They have red cream soda at the fountain!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Enough said"}
{"text":"Love This place! Food is Authentic, just like mom used to make! Rellenos & Green chile are TDF! I'm so glad they added agua frescas to the drink choices & I can even add a shot of tequila for a minimal charge!!"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food, is truly really authentic. I had tacos with rice and beans, best Mexican food I've had in a while. Will definitely be coming back !"}
{"text":"I came here during lunch on Taco Tuesday recently with a coworker. The food was great! The staff is friendly and the restaurant is clean. I will be returning. I highly recommend Espos if you want an authentic Taco Tuesday! The salsa bar was also nice. This is obviously a true locals favorite."}
{"text":"We went last Tuesday, got there at 6:30, and not  a place to sit, or park.  Long line for food. Food was good, but will order something different this time. The outside patio looked fun, had a DJ playing music.  Going back tomorrow night early to see if it's better. Going to sit on Patio this time!!!"}
{"text":"Thought we would have a snack since it was on our way. We were not glad we did. Chips had no flavor. Salsa was runny hot sauce. Carne asada tacos were overpriced."}
{"text":"Good Mexican food. Hot and tasty. Not the greatest you'll find in Arizona but it works. Hard tacos were my favorite. Chicken burrito was so so."}
{"text":"Delicious! Great food, great service. Having lived most of our lives in New Mexico, we are always in search for good green chili. Not the type with tomatillos in it, but rather the Hatch type green chili sauce. They have it down! Great sauce, quality ingredients inside the enchiladas, burritos and tacos. This is a regular favorite of ours."}
{"text":"I have lived in valley for about 6 years now and I have been looking for amazing authentic Mexican food. Espos is where its at! It was my fist time to Espos and I decided to get my favorites. I ordered a 3 taco plate with 2 ground beef tacos, a carne asada taco and 2 ground beef enchiladas. I love ground beef and it is seasoned just right! it isnt full of extras like potatoes or tomato sauce just simple ground beef and it is amazing! The Carne Asada is grilled just right and also season perfectly. Refried Beans are smooth and full of flavor and paired with fluffy rice round out the plate perfectly. The hot sauce is has just enough spice and compliments the food and adds the perfect amount of heat. Service is great and everyone was friendly and helpful. you know you found a special place when everything tastes like your Grandma was preparing it herself. This is my new spot for amazing Mexican food. 5 all day!!"}
{"text":"I am 36 years old and a native of arizona, I absolutely cannot believe I have never ate here before!!! I have only been there twice now and have only ordered green chili burritos.  They are absolutely out of this world!! I would recommend this place 10 out of 10 times!!!"}
{"text":"I can't even remember how long I've had this place bookmarked.  Way too long.  I kept reading the reviews and seeing the pictures from my fellow Yelpers and knew I had to go.  I went over today to grab some early lunch to go and was not disappointed.  The machaca is fantastic.  So tender and full of lightly spiced flavors.  Based on other trusted reviews, I got it in a burrito enchilada-style, Christmas sauce and really enjoyed that.  I would get that again anytime.    Then I got just a ground beef hard shell taco because I love the crunchy tacos and this one was simple and perfect.  The shell held up well, and was stuffed full of nicely seasoned meat and cheese, lettuce, & tomatoes.  For those 2 items it was $10.36 after tax.  (It's a buck fifty to make it Christmas)  Someone was a little slow greeting me and taking my order at the counter, but it wasn't like they were goofing off back there.  I could tell they were busy making delicious food.  It would have been nice if the dude industriously filling the napkins would have said something, but hey, they have those napkins full before the lunch rush.  The gentleman who did take my order was friendly and funny.  I had a great lunch and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Has the best taco Tuesday specials! Love it and delicious every time! 10/10 would recommend"}
{"text":"Whenever I'm back in AZ, this is where I want to come for Mexican food! I was a long time patron of Los Favs Taco Shop just down the street, but after finding out about this place I can count only a couple of times I've been back to Los Favs and every other time I've come here. The prices are great and the food is ever better! I love anything with the Chile Verde or Chile Rojo, it's some of the best I've ever had hands down. Their queso dip is one of a kind so so good! I hardly have gotten a combo because it is so much food, but so delicious! It's a little harder to get to but this hole in the wall is one of the best!"}
{"text":"This place is a MUST try! We went here after a festival and were starving. We met Leo the owner and he and the staff are just the NICEST and most welcoming! He chatted with us and made recommendations. We are new to the state and just found our new go to place. On to the food. Well it's DELICIOUS! We had the el jefe burrito enchilada style and the carne asada enchilada style. The meat was seasoned PERFECTLY topped with a tasty and a little spicy green sauce and cheese. The red sauce was also delicious. The whole meal was HUGE and soo satisfying. Another note is that the staff is SUPER SUPER clean and conscientious about being sanitary. A super duper plus for this neat freak germaphobe. Like I said try this place you will love it!"}
{"text":"Espo's is back with a vengence eversince they reopened. They have the best chimis I've ever had. You have to get one and it doesn't matter which one. My favotrite is the red chili but they're all amazing and you'll leave stuffed. They give a generous portion of toppings and the flavor is spot on. Go get that Chimi!"}
{"text":"It was a cold, wintery Friday night in the kingdom of Phoenix and I had pledged my allegiance to transport the fair maiden from her castle in downtown to the birthday banquet of her dear friend. It would be a grand feast, a feast large enough to rival the most important of dignitaries, it was not to be missed.   Travelling far, far away, to the foreign land of Chandler, I left the warmth of my hovel, with the young boy in tow and the fair maiden as our passenger. The 145 horse Toyota carriage made quick time of our travels as we escorted our passenger to her banquet. With two and a half rotations of the hour glass until her meal concluded, the boy and I were off to find a meal fit for a king.  I always travel with Lord Yelp's scroll of merriment and wonder, I wouldn't find myself beheaded without it. In truth, Lord Yelp's scroll of merriment and wonder is the quintessential catalogue for booths, stalls and eateries in every land, and on this night, it directed us to Espos, the most wondrous of food from the southern land of Mexico.  I am simply unable to agree more with the sentiment of Lord Yelp with regards to the Espos carnitas plate, simply put, it is the stuff in which the night's dreams are made of and the rice and beans were delectable as well. Should I find myself travelling in the land of Chandler in days ahead, I would not be opposed to again trading my coin for meal."}
{"text":"Some of the best Arizona Sonoran Mexican Food available anywhere.  I vote the Green Chili to be the best I've ever had.  Well, almost.  The best is what they made here before changes were made that eliminated the Hatch Chilies.  They no longer use Hatch even during the season when they are available.  I understand they may not have the freezer storage to stock for all year but for many years they did when they were available for a few months each year.  Still, the recipe is still the same otherwise and it's great!"}
{"text":"Very tasty Mexican with large portions for under $10.  It is not fancy.  You stand in line to order and then pick up your food at a counter and eat at either indoor and outdoor seating.  Again, it's nothing fancy, but it's nonetheless enjoyable if you don't expect to be waited on.  I've had their tamales and tacos thus far and liked them both.  On Taco Tuesdays they have a DJ and have taco and beer specials.  I'll be going back."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Great prices, great atmosphere, and AMAZING food. The taco Tuesday deals are insane as well. The food is so flavorful, all the spices and flavors keep you wanting more. I gotta get back here soon!"}
{"text":"Omg! Best best place to get some good Mexican food in Chandler! It's a smaller location but definitely homie! The food is amazing to a point where I wanted to go back the next day. So far we have been there 3 times and I am not displeased. The Machaca burrito is amazing! Nice and moist. Even the carne Asada is amazing.  **they need to have call waiting!! Trying to place a order can be frustrating when your trying to call it in!***"}
{"text":"This was some of the best, most authentic Mexican food I have had. This was our first time going, we went at 11:30 and the place was packed. To me that's a great sign! We had chimichangas and both types of tamales. People pile in to wait in line and find a seat. They do serve margaritas, but we just had a quick lunch and will try them next time. Fun fast paced atmosphere. Food was amazing, our kids devoured the leftovers on us. We cannot wait to go there again for margaritas and something new to try!! A+++++"}
{"text":"I want to say I was surprised at the quality of this place, but you can kind of feel it's going to be different by the energy of the building just driving by. Tired of looking for good Mexican food in a place that should offer it on every corner, we often don't bother anymore. Espo's, as you will read in their Yelp write-up, existed for 40 years in this same location until some time back and then was reborn this last year. We found it a few months after its re-opening and it was packed with a variety of folks, many of whom had apparently just found it as we had. Yesterday we were there again and noticed how many of the patrons were of Mexican descent--a very good sign. The food is the best you'll find for 20 miles in any direction and very reasonably priced. I tend to stick with what I like, so I can only directly speak for the tacos and the chimis. Staff is super-friendly, vibe is warm and cheerful and decor is simple old-world rustic. And they now have beer! Great outdoor patio seating."}
{"text":"Passed by this little \"hole in the wall\" dozens of times, never went.  Now I regret that.  The atmosphere is very casual and the staff is friendly.  It's a good sign when you see older Mexican ladies cooking in the back and patrons of Hispanic descent (ooh, that was really, really p.c.) at tables all around you.  The portions are sizable and the food tastes authentic.  The tortillas are excellent, large, thin, soft, warm.  Only tortillas that compare are Carolina's.  There were a couple food items that looked a bit different, maybe strange, but they were delicious.  The carne asada was like nothing I'd seen.  It looks like ground beef or some kind of soilant-green meat product,...sorry, sounds gross,....but it was really good and tasty.  I had low hopes for the guacamole when it came out and looked very smooth and maybe from a package.  But, I was wrong, it was excellent!  Beans looked a bit runny, but very flavorful and delicious!  Rice, excellent!!  Chicken asada, very soft and flavorful. The pico was super fresh and chilled,....salsa was fantastic and spicy.  Overall, I thought this was one of the best tasting Mexican Restaurants I have been to in quite a while and I already look forward to returning.  I'd definitely recommend it for out-of-towners looking for authentic Mexican cuisine, family fun, relaxing dinners or a night out with friends."}
{"text":"Best chorizo burritos in town.  The salsa is amazing too and I love that you can purchase large containers of the salsa to go!"}
{"text":"Nice close bike ride from my house and great taco Tuesday with good food and a fun environment !"}
{"text":"Best burrito ever from Espos tonight.  Try the El Jefe enchilada style with green sauce. Not only was it HUGE, but it was one of the best burritos I have ever had, and I've had hundreds of burritos all over the country."}
{"text":"Stopped by to check Espos out. Reminds me of a little hole in the wall place in San Diego, CA. Lunch time is busy-tables were dirty needed to wiped down. I spied a couple of large worms on the floor... Other than the cleanliness, the food is good. Good size portions for the prices. Tried the Beef Rolled Tacos/Flautas-very tasty & full of shredded beef. Also sampled the Carnitas Enchiladas meal-very tasty & full of carnitas. Will return to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"I hate myself. I have worked at the same place for 6 years. I have driven by Espos hundreds of times in those 6 years and always said I wonder if that place is good. It's SO good, why have I been cheating myself all of these years. It's hands down the best Mexican within lunch time distance of my work. I will be back to try more but in the back of my mind I will always regret the burritos I never ate because I didn't come in sooner. Don't be like me, eat here now."}
{"text":"So glad they are open again! Getting ready to bite into the best green chili in the city."}
{"text":"So good.  We ordered at the counter. The food was ready fast and HOT. it is authentic Mexican food. A bit far for me, but worth the drive."}
{"text":"Had the taco burrito,  was really good but a little to salty.   Will keep  trying different things and keep posting!"}
{"text":"Yum! Great food! I had the chicken burrito which was great! Next time, I'll ask for rice to be included in the burrito  though. Our friends had green chile burritos and loved them!"}
{"text":"Holy cow. When you know there's a giant crowd and a line out the door, this place means BUSINESS.  The seating area is very limited, suggest going early to have someone reserve your table. I watched a family get in a fight with another one over a table.   Their taco Tuesday is pretty awesome. 10 tacos for $10. A bucket of beer bottles (I think 6?) are $10. We ordered 10 tacos, nachos with guacamole, and their cinnamon something chip things (THEY ARE AMAZING BTW) Your tacos will come w just the meat, so make sure you grab the condiments in the tiny little stand inside.   The food was absolutely delicious. Explains why it's hard to find parking, seating, and the crowd. Well, I did go on a Tuesday ..... but nonetheless. OH. MY. GOSH. THIS PLACE IS THEEEEEEE. T.H.E. PLACE!!!!!! If you buy your alcoholic beverage outside, there's NO tax. So buy you drank outside.  Sorry I didn't take pictures, I was too busy stuffing my face. :P"}
{"text":"Conflicted! I cook my own Mexican food which I learned from my Mexican grandmother. This place is very close to authentic. Great rice, fair beans (watery and a bit salty), delicious tacos with tasty meat.  However, the red enchilada sauce is the reason we will not return. There were so many seeds and skins in the sauce, it was inedible. It ruined my beans and rice as well and I went home and threw out my left-overs.  I Never Do That!  The salsa was ok, too. Just ok. Very sad because we've heard great things about this place and it has been on our list to try."}
{"text":"Best green chile beef I have ever had.  Great Chimis.  Very authentic red salsa with good taste and not painful.  It's like your Hispanic buddy invited you to dinner at his  Abuelas's.  Casera  comida at it's finest.  Now if that liquor license would go through.....  Leave Someburros to the out of town gringos who wouldn't know good Mexican food when it's just down the street.  To the owner and employees, thanks for enduring and reopening, keep up the good work.  We Love Ya."}
{"text":"Maybe we came on an off day to Espo's?! After driving by so many times and seeing a full parking lot but always on my way to appointments or what not and just too busy to stop. Well, today I was finally in a place to stop and see what Espo's was all about! It was about 6pm and the line to order was already long. I geared up because I was hungry and just knew that this was going to be good! While waiting I noted that the patio was cute and decorated for upcoming Cinco de Mayo. Super festive! What I didn't like is that it's walk up counter service and there were no menus which in my opinion would be great for those waiting in a long line; trying to decipher a board menu can be blinding! My husband actually pulled a menu from Yelp while we waited. I have to admit, I am not one for counter service and wanted to maybe leave but I felt bad to go after asking my husband to turn around to come here. We finally get to the guy who took our order. He was less than enthralled with us. Whatever. I guess that's what you get with counter service. The water is set up in a big decanter by the doorway. Mind you the cups they give you are that of the dental office 'flush and spit' type. You may as well take as many as your hands will carry. Would it kill you to hand out bigger water cups? This is Arizona and it's 'authentic' Mexican food, right? You can tell I'm getting a bad taste in my mouth.. and the food has yet to arrive. We sat on the patio. I noted the beers seemed cheap. About 20 minutes later out over a speaker our number is called. Our order of chicken flautas and cheese enchiladas is ready. My husband collects it and it's in foil tins. So much grease is floating on the enchiladas that are souped in beans. We also got an order of chips with 'queso' and salsa. The chips and 'queso' are simply a few tortilla chips with melted shredded cheese on a paper plate. Bleh. The salsa is in small cups and it wasn't tasty. Our rolled tacos were frozen in the center and we took them back to Mister Un-enthusiastic. Did he care? No. The cheese was not melted inside the enchiladas either but at that point, we gave up. When they called for us to come get the rolled tacos .. again here came the bellowing ,'5 PIECE FLAUTA!' Across that noisy, impersonal speaker. Don't you think an error such as serving us uncooked food would have warranted a small act of kindness or decent customer service like bringing us the rolled tacos ? Guess what ? It's didn't. These were burned crisp and the two that were edible .. tasted like frozen , old , stale, rolled, used to be frozen tortillas. Hard. Pass. I would rather eat at a popular greasy taco shop known here in the valley that has better food than this IF I am going for the American-ized version of 'authentic' Mexican food. I don't even have to keep walking to tie water decanter there with my small dental sized cups! That's a joke, when saying it's 'authentic' , right ? Authentic for who??? So the cute patio.. it's cute. To me, that's all this place has going for it.  So many taco shops in the area ... keep driving and don't believe the hype. But I am only one Yelper that doesn't seem to believe this hype. This is my story and I'm sticking to it. Terrible."}
{"text":"Love, love, love the enchilada sauce and the refried beans are delicious! The quesadilla's delicious! I mean how can you mess up a quesadilla but so many places do.. But not Espo's, great every time and with there salsa it's amazing. Friendly service, they treat you like family. They want to serve you and make sure you have everything you need. I also love they offer strawberry cream soda, not too many places do. It's a nice change."}
{"text":"My family has loved this place for years! The staff is so kind and the green chile burro is the best in town and the red sauce is possibly the best I've had. Leon is a great guy and we will continue coming year for years to come!"}
{"text":"I had the green chili burrito and def no disappointments there! The salsa has always been tasty here :) The only thing I wasn't a big fan of was the Horchata. It's not homemade and too thick to be an \"agua fresca\" I'll be back for sure and can't wait to try more items :)"}
{"text":"I've been here twice since moving to Chandler, and this is one of the best places for flavorful Mexican food in the area. You can't beat the prices, atmosphere or taste.   The food takes a little while sometimes, and the line can be long, but that just goes to show that everything is homemade. As I coin this place:   \"Espos: no canned sauce here!\""}
{"text":"Espos Mexican Food has been a favorite of mine ever since I was a young boy. This place was never a fancy place to eat, but this restaurant near the corner of Chandler Blvd and McClintock has always put out great Sonoran style Mexican food.  The menu is geared towards spicy and hearty beef and other meat items. Burros stuffed with stewed beef and pork and enchiladas topped with fiery red or green chile sauce dominate the menu and should not be missed. Cheese crisps and tamales are also great. They also understand Christmas style.  I had to have my red tamale plate with a taco like usual. Taco Tuesdays are in force with $2 street tacos and $2 beers catering to the ASU college crowd. The red sauce was as hot as ever making this gringo sweat big time, and I loved every minute of it.  Food is served scalding hot making take out much easier than eating in the basic restaurant. Service can get slow, but the food is worth the effort and the burn!"}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday fun with the family is such a good deal here. Only spent $20, got 10 tacos, bucket of chips w/ huge container of guacamole, and 2 margaritas!! Not only was the food delicious so were the margaritas and you just can't beat that price. Definitely planning to be back often. Food gone too quick to even get a good pic!"}
{"text":"I've driven on Chandler Blvd. for the last 13 years and I regret to say that I just discovered ESPOs in the last couple months. Now that we got smart we have been there every Tuesday for Taco Tuesday. You can't beat their deals and the amount of food served. The atmosphere is so fun, music, patio & indoor seating. My only regret is not discovering Espos 13 years ago. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Pretty good Mexican food, I thought the tacos were really good. The enchilada sauce wasn't my favorite but still very good. A bit slow but that's to be expected on a busy night. Not a bad option for easy Sonoran food in Chandler."}
{"text":"Though the line is ALWAYS long when I come in, it is so worth the wait for the food. The food is ALWAYS fresh and tastes delicious. I'll always be back for my Mexican food fix."}
{"text":"Had the green chile burrito and it was pretty small. Next time I'll get the meal. Good taste but smaller portion than I expected."}
{"text":"Great food, clean atmosphere!  First timer and love a mean green chili.  Went with the El Jefe burrito based on recommendations here and was so happy I did.  My husband and I both had the same.  We will add this place to our regular lunch spots.  The place filled up after 12pm so try and hit it a little earlier.  Thanks Yelp and Espos!"}
{"text":"I have only had the chimichanga there but it is absolutely delicious.  The green enchilada sauce is the best I have ever had since moving to AZ.  My co-workers all think it's the best Mexican food ever as well.    I always take my order to go because it's a very small,cramped place and is busy because the food is so great."}
{"text":"I decided to come here after hearing about their Taco Tuesday special with little to no expectations. I really just wanted $1 tacos - which are only $1 if you get the 10 taco deal, and It's $1.50 if you don't. They also have a 3 tacos plus a drink for $5.00. I think the best deal in the house is their margaritas ($2) and beer buckets (5 bottles for $10).   Parking was pretty packed when I arrived (not the smallest of parking lot either) with 2 open lots. Entering through the gates, I can see why this place brings in a crowd on Tuesday. On the patio, they play lively Latin music as everyone enjoys their drinks and food. The line was not too long - the friendly staff works fast to get orders in, but getting orders out took maybe 20 minutes (not a bad time considering how packed it was). Getting a table was hard as well. You have to be ready to pounce on a table once it clears.  The food. If I wrote this review alone on just the food, and not considering the price, it would probably be only 2/5 stars. I had the mango peach fruit drink (pretty good, a little too watered down), 4 grilled chicken, 4 carne asada, and 2 carnitas. The tortillas are okay, nothing special. I personally like that they were not too soggy and didn't break so easy. I thought the chicken was going to be just GRILLED, but the final product was shredded chicken soaked in a broth. Carne asada seemed like it didn't get a good sear, and it possibly was rushed too quick or soaked in juice too long. Carnitas were the best, but I mean it's carnitas... always good - this one had nothing special to it. Lots of salsa and toppings to choose from; all were about medium spice. The lighter green sauce had more tomatillos sour to it, lighter red sauce has a stronger tomato base, dark red sauce is thicker with spices, and dark green sauce had a stronger hint of maybe oregano or cumin (was my favorite, especially on the chicken)."}
{"text":"For the quality of food you get, it's a very good place. And prices are very decent for the food you get. I always get the combination plates with machaca but any of the meats are good! Friendly customer service! Atmosphere is very neat. There's also a good amount of sitout areas in case you wanna sit out in the winter and fall times."}
{"text":"Food was great. I ordered the green chile plate with rice and beans chile was very flavorful. Service was awesome. Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"I've lived in Chandler for two years and pass this place all the time but always thought it was closed (the sign is a bit haggard). Anyway, I started a new job and some of the girls were talking it up so I decided to go to Taco Tuesday with them. $5 for 3 carne asada street tacos with a drink! The fresh salsa bar was great also and although the line was a bit long, the food came out quick and hot. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Ive been coming here for years and the food has always been great. One of my favorite Mexican restaurants, particularly for the basics. I usually just get the tacos. They do the basics very well. For a normal appetite, 3 will do it. Quite full. Over the years they've dramatically improved the atmosphere. It's clean, new tables, and big improvement to the patio area. Only reason I don't give 5 stars is that it takes quite a while for the food to be ready. But, worth the wait."}
{"text":"I love that Espo's is within walking distance. It doesn't get any better than this in Arizona. They have fresh made tortillas, chips, salsa, etc. I would highly recommend this establishment to anyone. It can get pretty busy during peak hours but don't let that deter you."}
{"text":"Wow...why is it so hard to find even half way decent Mexican food in Arizona???  Another attempt and failure today. Chips and salsa- chips over cooked and burned. El Jefe burrito- 2 lbs of overly salty nasty.  Even if it was free I would never come back.  I have no idea how this scoop and serve dump has a single good review. So far Arizona has the lowest standards for food I've ever seen."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this restaurant considering the reviews.  I went at 6 on a Friday, ordered the carne burrito enchilada style.  It took 35m for our to go order.  And then when we got it they made a mistake, and gave us the wrong burrito.  This was made worse by fact when I got back home I noticed that my burrito was burnt on the bottom.  It ruined the whole meal, I know they could smell it because I could when I opened the To Go container.  This is totally unacceptable.  Maybe they had a bad night, or a cook who was new, but this isn't worthy of the ratings given it.  I'd be embarrassed serving the food that they gave me."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, but the kid behind the counter was kind of rude. Margaritas come in a plastic  cup and were pre made in a plastic jug. The food is served on an aluminum plate after you order at the counter. Only plastic spoons and forks. More of a taqureia than a restaurant."}
{"text":"Visited here again, and got the Green Chile burrito! It's the best burrito I've ever had. All 3 of our meals were a total of $16 (you don't need to order sides but if you're sharing 1 is plenty!)"}
{"text":"Green chile burritos are legit!!! Red chile burritos good also. I just prefer green."}
{"text":"I'm so happy that Espos is back, I love their food!  Although casual and the food comes out on Aluminum Foil Bowls, it stacks up with any other high end Mexican restaurant in the Basin.   I love the El Jefe Burrito, it's even better as a Chimichanga, Enchilada Style!  It is a must try either way if you haven't yet.  As I mentioned this is a casual place, but they have a nice patio out front and the restaurant is actually super clean.  In-fact, it has the nicest bathroom of any casual eatery I have every been to.  On a side note, last time I visited Espos, I noticed they have applied for a liquor license; Yea, Margarita's!  Give them a try, you will love it!"}
{"text":"Espos is a taste of Mexico without the danger of Mexico ;) I've been eating here for a long time and really glad they have opened back up. I've pretty much eaten all the different items on the menu. I don't think they got their beer license back yet or I missed that on the menu. Don't let the look of the restaurant fool you. The food is better then fancy Mexican food places. The portions are really huge so it's easy to over order. I usually split something and add a cheese crisp or something with my fiance. The employees are always beyond friendly too. Restroom is out back in a separate building. Kind of weird but it looks clean so don't freak out.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Great tacos, great price, especially on Tuesdays, and tastes great."}
{"text":"Flautas: OH MY GOSH, so friggin delicious. 3 topped with chopped lettuce, tomatoes and sour cream - I would have preferred to eat just the flautas with all of the other stuff on the side. It tastes house made.  Tacos: carne asada, carnitas, beef machaca - each one was flavorful and the beef was tender. We had corn tortilla and hard taco and I enjoyed the corn tortilla more.   Overall, flavorful food for a decent price. Can't say its the best Mexican food I've ever had but it was pretty darn good!"}
{"text":"So glad other Yelpers led me to this place. It is delicious. I had the carne asada tostada. It was plenty for lunch. My only regret is the little plastic forks that are kind of flimsy. But I really can't find anything not to like!"}
{"text":"Great enchiladas! A bit on the hot side though. Took a friend here with my son and the food was terrific."}
{"text":"Are here for the first time. Everyone enjoyed their meal. I had a green chilli burrito and it was really good!"}
{"text":"Leon and his family are back in business. Best Mexican food in chandler. Same menu they had before..same speedy service.  Today is their Grand reopening"}
{"text":"Great taco Tuesday! Drink specials and patio music (w/misters). Taco meat was generous - salsa authentic as it gets! We'll be back for lunch or dinner other days too."}
{"text":"I must have driven by this place a thousand times and always wanted to try it. Yesterday a friend and I decided to finally stop in.  From the parking lot your not sure what to expect but once you walk in it's really clean and quaint. It does have a tendency to get extremely busy around lunch so I would go a little before or later to avoid the rush. You order at the counter and seat yourself until your number is called.  I ordered the beef green chili chimichanga and it was amazing! I could have done without the sour cream or had it on the side because it was a little much. I also really enjoyed the flavor of the salsa.  I will definitely go back and try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Espo's has always been one of my favorite spots in Chandler. The exterior is a bit off-putting, but I promise it's well worth the stop. Be prepared to fight for a table inside or to sit on the outside patio as the interior of the restaurant it fairly small. Parking can be a little hectic as the lot is a bit awkward and small.  The service at Espo's is always quick and friendly. You can expect your food to be ready in a matter of minutes. Honestly, you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. My personal favorites are the tamales, any of the tacos and the enchiladas. The posole is a can't miss when it's available. The portion sizes are great especially when considering the price. Everything is always warm and fresh and absolutely delicious.  Seriously, just go. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Espos was recommended to me on an airplane as the best Mexican food in town. It was indeed amazing. The tamales are awesome. The green chili is the bomb. The carne asana was killer. El Jefe was another favorite at the table. The owner, Leon, was super friendly making us feel like home right away with samples. Highly highly recommended by all 7 of us with my family."}
{"text":"Seriously my favorite. Great portions my husband and I always share. Laid back atmosphere, and they have a cute patio for when the weather is cool. Food is always great"}
{"text":"Great food! Horrible service! Just the way I like my Mexican food :-) don't expect friendliness as you would get slapped in the face with spices that make it worth it. Please and thank you are unheard of in this place. Even so, grandma's making some really good red chilli beef at Espos  :-)"}
{"text":"I once lived in this area about 20 years ago and was surprised to see this place still alive and kicken (minus the grocery store). Actually what they've done in expanding the place and creating a very cool ambiance (especially on the patio) is awesome. Very cool vibes and of course delicious Mexican food that tasted great!"}
{"text":"Having withdrawal from no Epso's food for nearly a year was not a good thing. We tried but could not find a suitable replacement. I have been eating at this place for almost 25 years.   Carne Asada Burrito Enchilada Style with Green Sauce is amazing. The old Red Salsa is the same. Flavorful and hot. We also tried the Chicken Enchilada's. For some reason it was cubed and not shredded chicken. Good but not as good as shredded and I hope they bring that back.  It was packed for lunch today and I hope they are on the right path to stay open another 25 years.   Welcome back Leon!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out meals, went home and found out they got one of the orders wrong, went back to Espos, the person behind the counter turned to the cook and laughed, by the time they corrected the order, went back home, the first order was cold.....no apologies from staff...never going back....there's a lot better Mexican restaurants in Chandler. Tom"}
{"text":"Not very many authentic Mexican restaurants in az like it :) Got a carne burrito, margarita and sat out on the patio. Friendly staff and awesome vibe. I Loved all the vintage appliances!"}
{"text":"This was hands down the best burrito I've had in over a decade!  I went off a friend's recommendation and was so glad I did.  I ordered a Machaca burrito, added beans and sour cream.  I also had the fresh pineapple juice and mixed it with fresh watermelon juice, it was so refreshing!  And the red salsa was also had a great complexity of flavor!!"}
{"text":"Nice little dive. Place gets busy. Patio to enjoy outside. Food was great and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Lived in Chandler for 4 years and finally decided to come here. What a wast of 4 years! The tacos and Chimi were excellent. Steady line of people but our wait for food wasn't very long. I can't wait to come back and try Taco Tuesday!!"}
{"text":"This is a great family owned restaurant and they make you feel like family. The food is tasty and authentic. They have the best chips and salsa in the valley! I absolutely love their ground beef, such a good flavor!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The food is always delicious and everyone is super friendly. I've been going here for almost 10 years now. I was heart broken when they closed for a little bit."}
{"text":"Delicious real Mexican food is what you get here. Food is excellent. You won't be disappointed if you like real Mexican food."}
{"text":"This is absolutely the very best tasting Mexican food in AZ without question. Super casual so no dress code of any kind, family friendly place. In between a Taco Shop and a restaurant. More like a Taco Shop with seating, but exactly what you are looking for when you need really great Mexican food. Nothing is even close to bland. A Must Try Restaurant."}
{"text":"Pros: +Solid quality +Solid prices  Cons: None  ---------------------------------------------------- Great no-nonsense spot. Ordered the El Jefe Burrito and a chicken taco and was not disappointed. The burrito tortilla was perfect and the seasonings of the beef were delicious, as well as under $6. The taco was also reasonably priced and was decent. It was all tied together with very tasty in-house green chile salsa.  Am definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Little hole in the wall. Omg the green chili is to die for! BEST IN AZ hands down. I had a bean and cheese burrito smothered in green chili. Chili has just the right kick with heat. Add sour cream to chill it down if you need it. Beans were nice and creamy and they did not skimp on the cheese. My new favorite place!!!!"}
{"text":"Had the beef tacos and they were great!  Shells were homemade and the perfect level of greasiness goodness."}
{"text":"Fresh and authentic.... that's all that matters and you will not leave unsatisfied, I promise."}
{"text":"The red chile chimichanga enchilada style is to die for!  I've heard some people complain about the price but this is worth the saying you get what you paid for! I loved it."}
{"text":"We came for the first time yesterday after reading the reviews and family speaking highly of them. It's amazing!!! We came for taco Tuesday and it's an awesome deal of 10 for $10 street tacos and $2 beers and margaritas! It was such a great deal we will be coming every Tuesday now. All of the other food looked so good too I want to try everything. The prices are cheap for great quality food! The dj playing was really really good too it was such a fun atmosphere"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I have had! Everything we order was great and their green chili burrito was to die for!"}
{"text":"I'd been wanting to try this place for awhile. The good news is that it seems clean, is decorated nicely, and service was fast. They have a fairly large patio area to enjoy. The food itself was a mixed bag though. The tortillas themselves are good quality. My carne asada was neither good nor bad- just decent. The beans had a nice flavor but were on the runny side. My son wanted to try the flour tortilla chips, but neither of us liked them at all. I think corn tortilla chips are the way to go. The salsa was given a thumbs up by my son though. I think Espo's has the potential to be a place we would enjoy, but we need to try some other menu items first."}
{"text":"Best mexican food in the valley! The price and taste is perfect! The machacha beef is a must!"}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday can't be beat! 10 for $10 soft tacos, taco topping bar. Called ahead, waited exactly 1 minute to ring up. Also, try the Taco Enchilada Christmas style and the chile relleno. Both the best in town."}
{"text":"Hours are until 9pm and I got there at 7:06pm and they decided to close at 7pm for no reason. It wasn't a holiday or anything. So if you want horrible service, go here."}
{"text":"Love love the bean and cheese burrito enchilada style with green sauce...one of my fav spots in Phx"}
{"text":"Awesome tacos, awesome queso, awesome  hot sauce. We love this place and go here often for Taco Tuesday. Tacos are $1.50 each on Tuesday! Get here early though, there's always a line!"}
{"text":"Me: I'm sad to say I was a little underwhelmed. I had high hopes for this place based on the reviews, but the whole experience was kind of meh for me.   Craig: I would eat about 25% of that stuff again. I think we both left about half our meals on the plates.   Me: Agreed. The chicken enchiladas with green sauce were decent, maybe 3.5 or 4 stars for me.   Craig: The green chile was probably a four star. But the surroundings...  Me: Yeah, the beans and rice were really bland, especially the rice. The chips were okay, but that red salsa was so bitter I couldn't eat it.   Craig: The salsa was weeeeeak.   Me: Plus, when I order food to stay, I'd like a real plate and forks that don't melt at the tips. Another reviewer said it was like sit-down dining with Filiberto's prices. But it was more like Filiberto's 2.0.   Craig: It was a little pricier than Filiberto's, so my recommendation is go to Filiberto's.   Me: Yeah, it was okay food in a decent setting, but I can't give it more than 3 stars. I don't think I'd come back since there are Mexican restaurants that are four or five stars for me.  Craig: Yeah.   Me: Craig, you need to come up with things beyond \"Yeah.\"  Craig: *laughing*   Me: They did have a cute patio, but they had a DJ out there, and I don't love loud music while I eat. So this is a pass for me.   Craig: Yeah ;)  Mandy: We didn't take any pictures this time...  Craig: They would have been sad pictures.   Me: Yeah *sigh*"}
{"text":"This has become one of my favorite Mexican food restaurant in the valley.  It's \"order at the counter\" style.  The burritos are tasty!  I've found it to be consistent too."}
{"text":"Pretty good mexican food. A local favorite for many people.  Great Taco Tuesday also! I stopped in this morning and grabbed 3 Carne Asadas and 1 Carnitas. The carnitas was much better than the carne asadas."}
{"text":"We were at Chandler Mall and wanted to eat, so I looked on Yelp for nearby restaurants.  This place had 4 plus stars from over 100 reviewers, so we figured it must be good. It is not a fancy restaurant.  You order at the counter and pick your food up when they call your number.  Service is 2 stars at best.  Metal tables and chairs.  Very casual atmosphere. Maybe we ordered the wrong things, but we were not impressed with the food.   Would not return."}
{"text":"Nostalgia drew us in as it's place my grandparents used to bring me when I moved out to AZ before they closed temporarily. Not sure we will ever return again though unless in area and it's convenient. Ordered 4 bean burritos, all without cheese and 2 with pico. Two burros broke open upon first grab, after waiting 20 minutes for our order. Granted it was a Sunday at around 1pm and busy, had to wait to ask for extra tortillas to double wrap tortillas and by time done fixing the busted open burros my burro was cold, and then broke open as well. Beans tasted authentic and bonus for vegan friendly (no lard yay) but made for a sad dining experience that was meant to be a treat out for birthday."}
{"text":"One of my go-to's for Mexican food that does not disappoint! Been going here for 10 years and wouldn't stop"}
{"text":"Holy guacamole this place is awesome! Sit down Mexican food for Filibertos prices. Sauces are authentic and green and red chilli beef are as good as a more expensive restaurant. Burritos are in the $6 range which is incredible and the chimichangas are $8. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great Mexican restaurant close to many shops and activities. We just ate there for the first time and enjoyed one red and one green chile combo dinner. We could have had tacos, too. The food was authentic, delicious, and tortillas very nice. They have bottled drinks, sodas and ice tea. The service was friendly and quick. The chips and hot salsa exceptional! We will for sure return."}
{"text":"Long time no see Espo's  great place to grab and go or sip on a Chilled bottle of beer. Informal, up front no nonsense type of place . Food like your mama used to make if you grew up eating Mexican food. There's a reason why the line is always out the door and parking is a bit problematic. But so worth it. But just don't take my word for it. Tell them I sent you;-)"}
{"text":"First of all I am a newbie to Arizona but love good Mexican food.  Being from the midwest what I know as Mexican isn't exactly the same as what I am finding out here in the desert southwest!   I was surprised to find so many \"chain\" restaurants and not as many authentic Mexican ones as I expected to be out in this area of the country.   Espos is a delightful little place to eat and I must say the food was exceptionally good!  It is nothing fancy, and somewhat small but the cooks know what they are doing when it comes to preparing Mexican cuisine.   I came on a Wed. around 1:30 in afternoon to miss the crowd, since I was alone.  You could tell they had been busy but the place was still well kept.  There are no floor servers, you go up to counter and order off of a huge wall menu then find a table.   They have EVERYHIING!!  I was so happy to find cheese dip! Not easy to find out here but all mex places back in Indiana serve it.  Didn't have to wait too long for my food.  I had the chicken/onion burrito with cheese dip and salsa/chips.   I was only able to eat half of it and took rest home.   The prices are very reasonable and most items are ordered \"a la carte\" style.    I am sure going to return here again in the future.   As the weather is finally cooling down I am looking forward to sitting out on their spacious patio,  perhaps in the evening sometime soon. Monica"}
{"text":"Omg soooo good and affordable!! I haven't found an authentic Mexican place and I think as of today I've found it! Sooo delicious!!"}
{"text":"We've all been to scores of fast food taco stands, this one is top notch. Excellent grub, the full range of menu items, the food is just better here. I think it's better than Carolina's.  Update: I had to remove a star from my review due to the fact this place can't keep up with its popularity. Sunday at 1:30pm waited 35 mins for our food, far too long for pre-made grub. The order wasn't correct either"}
{"text":"Omg. Not even sure where to begin but thank you Yelp for helping us find a true gem among mere wannabes. This place will not disappoint and although I live 40 minutes away, I will be back. The carne Asada. Omg. To die for!!!! I got a 3 Taco plate with rice and beans. The creamiest beans and the most flavorful rice! They even have baggies of cinnamon sugar chips complimentary. They were so good I think I ate 3 baggies!!!!!!!! This is authentic, high quality Mexican food. Not only was the food fabulous but the ambiance was so nice. The patio had fires going and twinkling lights and it was such a nice evening enjoying delicious food in the patio with friends. I love this place and can't say enough good things. Also, the price is right!!"}
{"text":"Great food, family atmosphere, hit it on Tuesday.  It was 10 street tacos for $10.  I ordered the guacamole side and it was a whole bowl full.  I will go back."}
{"text":"First place we tried moving here from the Bay Area CA. Coming from a state that every Mexican restaurant you go to is good we had high expectations for AZ. We each ordered burritos. Their burritos only include meat, rice, and beans and either green or red sauce. I've never had a burrito like that before. I had to pay to add sour cream, guacamole,pico de gallo, and cheese. It was very flavorless. We will not be returning"}
{"text":"Love taco Tuesday - it's a fiesta! They have a DJ, patio bartender, and a great atmosphere. They also have great authentic food just like you get in Mexico; simple and fresh."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Chandler. Try it. You will not be disappointed. Green chili is amazing."}
{"text":"Espos is a small family owned place.  It's cute, quaint, and very clean.   It's walk up service, but the folks at the counter are friendly and attentive.  Cons:    No salsa fresca bar.  I love pickled Jalapenos and carrots, but they do not have any.  I ordered two chicken tacos.  I got two ground beef tacos.  Pros:  Even though they gave me the wrong tacos, the ground beef had a great flavor!  The amount of meat in it was pretty hefty as well!  Really, really good tacos!  I got the El Jefe burrito as well.  Not your traditional carne asada.  This is with cheese and green chiles.  Kinda heavy, but fantastic flavor!   Absolutely worth a return trip!!  I got my son a couple bean and cheese burritos, and he loved them.  All in all, I'm very happy with Espos.  This isn't a cookie cutter, bland chain store.  This is the real deal!!"}
{"text":"Wow! Good food, great prices, big servings, quick service, nice personnel, clean and neat dining areas, friendly atmosphere, etc., etc. A nice surprise for out-of-towners like my wife and me. Yelp led us to Espos but all of the aforementioned will bring us back. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday specials were great! We got 10 tacos for $10. We tried the carnitas, chicken and carne asada. My favorite was the carnitas but they were all tasty. We also got margaritas for $2 which were delicious. The menu is big and you can order a variety of Mexican dishes. The location is casual and welcoming. Parking can be limited if there is a large crowd. There is outdoor and indoor seating. Our food was ready within 10 minutes of ordering and the service was kind. We will likely visit again!"}
{"text":"I don't get it.  There are so many positive reviews of Espos.  Almost certain our flauta plate was frozen not long before being served.  The centers of the flautas were ice cold.  Ice cold chicken.  Hmmm.  Had them remade.  The second batch was hot, but tasted like cardboard.   The enchilada plate sauce was delicious, but the cheese enchiladas themselves...well, after a couple bites that exposed the center of the enchilada, it was just a hunk of unmelted shredded cheese out of a bag.  Unmelted.  Just a lump of shredded cheese.  I could have done a better job of melting shredded cheese at home.   Moving on, the refrieds would have been tastier if they had come out of a smaller can.  Seriously they were just flavorless brown mush.    The chips with melted cheese were fine, but greasy.  The salsa was spicy.    I can think of 100 other Mexican restaurants I'd rather patronize in the valley.   But hey, I was able to get a beer and sit on a neat patio.   And I certainly had good company."}
{"text":"This place will change your life!!! I love their machaca enchiladas with green sauce and their green chili burritos!! Wow!! Now, I'm hooked on their red chile tamales! They're huge and full of meat! In fact, I'm going there tonight to stock up!!  Taco Tuesday is insane, but awesome! 10 street tacos for $10, AND you can mix them up! I got 5 machaca, 5 chicken, 4 tamales and a margarita for like 20 bucks!!!   Just an awesome place! I'm so glad it's close to my house!"}
{"text":"I had the shredded beef burrito with red sauce and it was outstanding. The beef almost melted in the mouth. I can't wait to get back to this side of town."}
{"text":"Got the machaca beef burrito. Soooo juicy.  Great value!  Nice, big portion, under $6.  The salsa is too spicy for me, I wish they had an ultra-mild.  Best cheap/value mexican place in the area.  I used to go to Amado's, but this is closer, has wifi, newly remodeled, cute outside patio, about the same prices/portions.  The first time I went here, the wait time was a little long, they had lots of people (usually a great indicator that the place is good though!), but it was super fast last time (still had lots of people eating/in line also). :)"}
{"text":"What a treat! I'm sad it's taken us this long to discover this little gem. The place is tiny but mighty. We ordered flour chips and salsa , a carne Asada burrito and carnitas burrito . The chips were amazing! Unfortunately I couldn't stop eating them!! This was my first try at flour chips .. but definitely going into our regular rotation! The chips were hot and fresh and so crispy . Both of our burritos  were easily the size of an adult forearm . Both were stuffed full of tender and perfectly seasoned meat. I recommend every authentic Mexican food lover to come out to chandler and give this little dive a try ."}
{"text":"Beyond happy that Espo's is back in business! Everyday driving by on the way home was so sad knowing that Espo's was gone. All I could think was how much business would have been brought in by the new hotel across the street. Well now it will!  Same menu as before but laid out very nicely in the front of the restaurant. Same type of ordering process, order at the front, they call your number when your order is ready. It looks like they no longer have a liquor license which is no big deal to me and I don't think it will be detrimental to the business, the food speaks for itself.  I had two machaca beef tacos which were delicious. Espo's does machaca beef so well. The green chile beef is a staple here and great in both burrito form as well as chimichanga if you are being adventurous. Service was great.  I'm so glad Espo's is back. Reasonably priced Mexican food that is done so well. You can't beat it!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is affordable and yummy! I dig the decor and love that they offer fresh lemon water!! Cool eclectic spot! Definitely recommend eating here my family and I enjoyed it"}
{"text":"Since Espo's has returned, it's given me a reason to go back to chandler in search of some decent Mexican food.  This joint really measures up to some of the best Mexican food in the valley and when it went away it damn near brought a tear to my eye.  The Green chili is the best, and it hasn't changed in flavor since its return.  I recommend the El Jefe burrito, its steak and green chili with a kick, the green chili its hot and the steak is tender and peppery.   Espo's hasn't been open very long and so the soda fountain isn't working but they gladly gave me a free soda when I needed a refill.  The staff is pretty friendly and they were appreciative that we came back to dine there. I highly recommend this place for great Mexican food in chandler."}
{"text":"Ok, it's my first time here - and won't be my last! Pleasant surroundings, friendly staff, and outstanding food!  The place is very clean, and open. In cooler months, the patio would be a good choice.  Julie was very friendly and helpful. As soon as I said it was my first visit, she offered samples. That helped me decide between Green Chile and Machaca Beef. Both tasted great, but I gave the nod to the Machaca. The beef was tender and oh so flavorful! I was also undecided between a standard burrito or enchilada style, and the staff recommended that I get it plain.  My order came quickly. The tortilla was fresh and tender, and the burrito was incredible! Very moist and well spiced. Next time I'll try the Green Chile, maybe enchilada style.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Fleeing the monotony of the neighboring mall food court, I stumbled into Espos. Welcomed by the cashier and understated dining area, you immediately get the feel of a family run hole in the wall. I ordered the green chili burrito which retained the authenticity of a traditional Mexican meal."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food in the valley.   The food is true Mexican food too therefore it's NOT covered with tons of cheese (which ruins good Mexican food in my opinion). Staff was good - it's mainly self serve and they call your number when the food is ready.  We ordered chips and salsa, horchada, carne asada plate, and the red tamales - all for about $20.  This place is going to be our \"go to\" when we are craving Mexican food."}
{"text":"Now this spot is one that i would call authentic. Burritos are simple and delicious with out all the American style sour cream and guacamole which you can get added if you please but you won't need. The meat, pico and cheese do the talking also can't forget about the beer and drinks! Taco Tuesday's are cheaply priced and fun. Outdoor seating of course which is regularly cleaned. Everything you could ask for."}
{"text":"Came by, along with everyone else in the county, for Taco Tuesday.  Wow...the place was a whole new restaurant.  There was DJ on the patio, the parking lot was overflowing, and the line was loooong.  Don't drop by for a quick bite on Tuesdays.  If you do come by though you'll find great taco, beer, and margarita specials.  $10 for 10 tacos that are overflowing with meat was a tremendous deal.  I grabbed 10 to go and a Negro Modelo for the wait.  Suddenly I'm looking forward to next Tuesday."}
{"text":"This is the place to enjoy some flavorful good Mexican food.  My favorite is the green chili.  Spicy & yummy. The beans are fresh, the rice is moist not dried out like some places.   I recently catered an event and got rave reviews from my guests.  Had the red Chile & shredded chicken as main dishes. The chicken went super fast. Delish! The red Chile was so yummy people were complimenting me all night on the good food. Thank you Leon for making my event a huge success.   You are my favorite!"}
{"text":"Great \"fast\" Mexican food,  well prepared.  Beats the heck out of the other \"Mexican\" restaurants in the area.  Served on paper plates and tin pans but hey it's reasonably priced and tasty!  Good quality ingredients.  Better than the sit down Mexican restaurants in the area.  They do have outside and inside seating so it's not a take out only place.   Nothing to dislike, its all good."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in town. Good food and the quality is always consistent. Have to come for taco Tuesday's."}
{"text":"We were visiting Phoenix from OKC for a business trip and were craving Mexican food so I found this place on Yelp and saw that it was nearby and had decent reviews.  It's got a decently sized outdoor seating area and a smaller indoor seating area. The inside was a bit disorganized- there was no formal \"order place\" it seemed, since nobody was standing at the cash register. A woman kept running back and forth, setting orders on trays and calling out numbers. People would come and grab their trays, meanwhile a few customers had gathered in the same area and were confused as to where we should stand to indicate we wanted to order.  There was only one large menu on the wall, no handheld menus to read, so that was a bit difficult without my glasses.  Either way, we did get to order and took a seat at a table to wait for our number to be called. At first it seemed a tad pricy, but we hadn't seen the food yet. We sipped on our aguas frescas while we waited. They were delicious! They had watermelon and peach. Both were amazingly good. One free refill allowed for those.  We got our food in no more than 10 minutes. My chimichanga was HUGE so I was glad I didn't add rice and beans. There wasn't a ton of flavor but it worked for me because it was perfectly crispy and had plenty of sour cream, shredded cheese, lettuce, and tomato. Some kind of special sauce on top would've been nice, though.  The burritos were rather large, too. My friend said the steak inside was pretty good and they are not skimpy at all with the meats, so it was definitely a good value. The rice and beans were also very good and clearly homemade.  We would totally be back if we come to the area! Hopefully the ordering and front counter area gets a bit more organized, though."}
{"text":"Thank you Yelpers for your help in finding this great place!  Great, authentic Mexican food that was served with a smile and very quickly.  We had the good fortune of sitting by the owner (or one of the owners).  What a great guy!  My son and I felt very welcome and we were invited back to celebrate Cinco de Mayo.  We live an hour away and really wished they had a location close to us (Anthem - hint, hint).    Do not pass up the flour tortilla chips! They come out warm and are addicting.    I had the carnitas plate which was very good (and spicy!) and my son really enjoyed his taco burro.    Will definitely visit Espo's again when we are back in the area."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food I've had in the valley. I think I've  had one of everything on the menu, and not a one has disappointed. Huge fan of this place. They also have a nice patio area to sit, eat, and chat on nice cool days. If  you're in the mood for Mexican this place will not disappoint.   Bests Jason"}
{"text":"If i could give zero stars, id do it in a heart beat. I am the party planner for my team at work and someone suggested you guys as an option, remind me never to let that happen again!!! They are great for personal orders(maybe) but DON'T EVEEVVVEEERRRR go here for ordering more than 2 peoples food at a time on one ticket. I called in an order for about 15-20 people, everyone mostly got a burrito/rolled tacos so we didn't think it would be that bad... I told her everything the team ordered, including if they asked for no cheese on their stuff because we had about 4 people that could not eat it(allergy's and lactose) . First of all, after it was all said and done, the order was NOT repeated to me so I think that was the first mistake. When i went to pick up the food, it was so busy the lines were out the door so i cut them some slack. I waited for about 15 or 20 minutes after the time they said it would be ready. I work about 8 miles away from ESPO's and I have to use my own car and gas to drive out there and back. When me and another coworker picked up the food and drove back, we realized about more than half the teams food was wrong. Of course, I got talked to and bombarded because of this issue, like i shouldn't be able to trust ESPO's with not messing MOST of the order up. One or two mistakes, okay I get it but this was too much!!!! I spoke to an employee who said they would be able to refund some of the tacos and burritos so I could use it for gas which was not very much as all. They remade the stuff they messed up and sent me on my way, it was my mistake not to check it again. When I got back and my coworkers told me the order was wrong again, I got so mad, I was on the verge of just grabbing all of the food and get a whole refund. Was this really worth the hassle? Only 2 people got the food out of the 4 that was missing, even the people who had their food right said the burrito was REALLY soggy.  I called in again and i really wasn't the nicest, the manager stated, \" I would hate to ask you to come back again but I don't know what else I can do.\" I told him he either refund the whole order or remakes the whole thing for the next day. I spoke to my manager who said to decline the option of remaking the whole order again for the following day because he was afraid they would go as far as spitting in the food for as bad as the service was. Would you drive back a third time??? NO! He then said he didn't think it was fair at all since they refunded a small amount of the food and remade the food missed. At this point, 200$ for these meals was way over pricing everything i went through with this restaurant and how upset my employees were at me. It was such a bad experience, i shed a few tears and I can hold myself together pretty well so it says a lot! The manager's name was BETO, please take my word for it, DO NOT EAT HERE UNLESS ITS JUST YOU!!! :( I really wish they would have just remade the whole order, their food is good when they take their time. I lived across from this restaurant for 8 years, almost my whole childhood until my mother moved 4 years ago. It was good then, WHAT HAPPENED, GUYS!!!?!?!?!?!?!?!!? We could have been ESPO's favorite/best paying customers....now another company gets our money. I am a such an idiot for tipping you guys 10$, If i could i would come get it all back. The worst part about this was that my food was right but when i got back, it was so cold that i ended up having to throw it away. i benefited NOTHING from this besides 4 hours off of the phone WHERE I ACTUALLY MAKE MY MONEY!!!  Thanks ESPO's for costing me more money than I paid for!!!!! Horrible experience."}
{"text":"My goto mexican food  resturant.  Have tryed several  differant things here and you cant go wrong with anything  you order here.  I just had the chimichanga,  carne  asada.  It was out of this world. And for under 8 bucks.   I look forward to trying  every else they got here.  Run dont walk to this place, its that good.   Large portion size. And very reasonable  prices."}
{"text":"This is the most authentic Mexican food we have found in Chandler area.  Great food, large portions, and friendly staff.  They have us samples tho help us decide what to order.  Very flavorful food, will definitely go back."}
{"text":"So can I start off by saying the food is amazing!!! The customer service is also exceptional. I went in today for my first taco Tuesday at this location and can I just saw you must stop by. The Tacos are packed with meat and they have a decent salsa bar sitting in a slightly awkward place but they do make sure to refill it quit frequently. But anyway back to the deals. 10 tacos for 10 dollars and 2 dollar beers. Great deals, amazing food and an awesome staff will make the wait worth it."}
{"text":"El Heffe --- GOOOD! They have Taco Tuesday 10 street tacos for $10. Cant beat that $1 per taco :-)"}
{"text":"Espo's authentic Mexican is where it is at!! I have been there for two taco  Tuesdays and the line is out the door and moves very fast! The street tacos are amazing and you can get three tacos and a drink for $5.00!  Large salsa bar and great counter service and energy!"}
{"text":"I first ate here in 1976. Just as good today as it was back then. Their green chili burritos are the best and their salsa is delicious!"}
{"text":"Many years ago, Dude lived in the apartments across the street from Espo's.   I guess \"technically\" I did too, but we won't get into that.  ;)   Sure, we heard all of the epic stories about their incredible machaca and legendary green chile options and Christmas tamales, but despite the SUPER close distance, we never made it in.   Sad trombone when they closed. :(  ... Until Espo's reopened, woohoo! Let's remedy this with an afternoon off work!  It's a humble, small restaurant. All signs pointing to, \"Prepare to be domerocked!\"   Don't expect anything fancy or sit down; if you're seeking that, do us a favor and drag your hoity toity self to the Biltmore.   Now that that's out of the way ... What to expect?   Freaking AMAZING food.   We shared the El Jefe Burrito. Steak, cheese, jalapeños, I think there was Pico de Gallo and red salsa.   Super delicious and filling! The steak was tender and the flavors worked well together.   Although after reading Jay M.'s review (and looking at pictures) I immediately regretted not getting it Chimichanga and Enchilada style.   The guacamole is also fresh and out of this world!   A word of warning though, do not order it if you struggle with spice.   Thanks to cooking for a Latino man for 5+ years, I went from \"Taco Bell Mild Sauce is painful!\" to \"WTF is this?! Have her bring more chilies, hon!\" (While eating Thai Hot Pad Thai at the supposed highest level of spice!) Let's just say my eyes were running rivers after each chip. Delicious!  Can't wait to try the rest of the menu.   I'm soooooooooo sorry I overlooked you, Espo's - Don't ever leave Chandler again!"}
{"text":"Excellent spot! We are here for a baseball tournament and found this little gem. The food was delicious! I had one chicken taco on a corn tortilla and one carne asada on a corn tortilla.  My mom got a taco salad and my cousin ordered two hard shell tacos with beans inside and also a side order of rice. We also ordered an order of chips and salsa with a side of guacamole! We will definitely be coming back when we are in town! Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Espo's is authentic in both their ambience and food. I recommend their burrito in enchilada style with a side of rice."}
{"text":"Not sure what occurred tonight but I called ahead for my food so naturally when I arrived at about the time the young woman on the phone told me, I fully expected my food to be ready sooner rather than later. I stood in line & paid. Then I sat down directly across from the register & waited. As I started hearing order numbers called off I took another look at my receipt to make sure I wasn't going crazy, sure enough my number had not yet been called & the new numbers were steady getting larger & larger (than mine). The young lady behind the counter said nothing to me until I stood back on line to cancel-she must have sensed my agida when she said 'Isra, I see her wrapping your order now - she had to re-make it'  I grabbed my order & when I arrived home was really annoyed to find that my enchiladas were flat & food was not secured in its packaging. The top was loose & had shifted into my food! I'll have to see how I feel about visiting again because my tolerance for poor customer service is really low. The food is good but not worth this kind of hassle - I waited about an extra 10 minutes after I called ahead. What sealed it for me was the hostess lack of attention until I stood up to get ready to leave - she totally could have said across the countertop, 'hey they had to re-do' or any number of things... we'll see what happens going forward."}
{"text":"Having lived in Mexico City and Santa Fe NM, two incredible culinary capitals of the world, I found myself in Chandler AZ on business and looked for a non-chain good place to do a quick dinner.    Enter Espo's in Chandler.  I was told that it had recently been remodeled but it looks and feels like it's been like this since the 50's - Spartan, cement floors, standard tables and chairs.  Exactly how it should be.  The staff are 4 Latin women speaking Spanish and very friendly and happy.  No attitude.    Food - I ordered the green chile beef burrito and the beef floutas.   Unlike Same in either Mexico City or Santa Fe.   The burrito was excellent - soft tortilla wrapping a mushy mix of refried beans, shredded beef and subtle hints of green chile - simple but really effective (a+).  The floutas - over cooked hard shells, not enough inside and a little bland -rescued by surrounding lettuce, tomato, cheese and added red hot sauce (b-).  Add a dos Equis with a lime, with tip was 15 bucks.    Quick service, overall A- food and appropriate surroundings and I highly recommend a stop in.  Set expectations correctly - this is not American Mexican - nor is it traditional Mexican cuisine (mole, al pastor, etc), nor is it high end regional cuisine (green chile from Romero farms NM on grilled elk).  It is basic SW USA Mexican, low cost but very good at what they do.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch after wanting to try this place for some time now. Had the carne asada burrito and I was not impressed at all. Firts if you are going to classify the meat as \"asada\" it can't be boiled. Well after this experience I don't care to try anything else here. Don't know what they hype is about. It's not that complicated to make decent food. All four people in my lunch group agreed, bad choice. We should have just did sushi."}
{"text":"This was our first time being here.  I went into the website to check out some pictures of the items. I saw a picture of the machaca beef burrito enchilada style which looked amazing. This is what I ordered and it did not disappoint. My wife ordered the el jefe burrito which was steak, green chili, cheese and pico. She ordered it without pico, but it was wonderful as well. Small inside seating area with great atmosphere. Can't wait to go back and try more dishes."}
{"text":"DDDDDAAAAAANNNNGGGGG!!!!! THIS PLACE IS SOOOOO GOOD! Seriously BEST Mexican Food I Have EVER had! It even beats the Mexican dinner I paid $150 for in Las Vegas! Espos has RIDICULOUSLY AMAZING Green Corn Tamales! WOOOW! Equally Great are the Carne Asada Tacos, Machaca Flautas, and Carne Asada Burritos. The rice, beans, guacamole, and salsa  just no words so good! I have been here several times and I'm determined to try the whole menu.  The lines are crazy long on Taco Tuesday I recommend placing a phone order and picking up. Unless you are craving their delicious $2.00 Margaritas then it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"We have lived by this place for over 4 years and had yet to try it out. Today we decided we will go for it and boy was it good! I'm so disappointed I waited this long to try it out. I got the veggie burrito since I'm vegetarian along with a side of their Spanish rice. The burrito and the rice were both amazing! Definitely will be going back to Espo's!"}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican food in chandler! The shredded beef tacos are amazing! Don't miss the flour chips and queso"}
{"text":"Love coming here for Taco Tuesday! Bike riding distance from home and great food/ drinks. The patio is great but the music is too loud to actually have a conversation. Would enjoy our evening so much more if it was a little lower! It kind of ruins the chill vibe :/"}
{"text":"This place is fast if you're in need of fast lunch.   Cashier was friendly and fast.  Food was delicious, fresh veggies and salsa on the self serve bar.  Both inside and outside seating. What a cool place for lunch I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Just eat here. Stop fooling around on the internet and go get a tasty burrito!   Honestly though, I shed a single tear when this place closed it doors....but now it's back!   Not quite as good as when they first opened, but maybe I just don't like people and they are busier than ever..."}
{"text":"Despite having grown up in Chandler/Tempe/Ahwatukee for over 20 years, I've fallen behind on the local food scene. Quite a bit has changed in the past 2 years, and it seems like its all for the better. Espos food tastes like your 90 year old grandma is in the back cooking for you, and you alone. The food is savory, filled with depth and flavor, and feels unique. There's no shortage of taco shops in Arizona, but Espos has done something completely different and is what I would call \"Mexican Soul Food\".  The menu is a little daunting and complex, but its essentially 4-5 different fillings (green/red chile shredded beef, carne asada, chicken, etc) in 4-5 different shells (chimichanga, burrito, enchilada, tacos, etc). There are plenty of combinations to keep things interesting and fresh. Based on Yelp reviews/pictures it felt like the consensus was to go with a chimichanga, and since green chiles are apparently in season, my final choice was a green chile beef chimichanga. I owe a lot to my fellow Yelpers who guided me to a blissful destination. I've never been so happy in my life. The deep fried chimichanga is crispy on the outside, hot on the inside, and topped with tomatoes, lettuce, and sour cream. Despite being deep fried, it doesn't feel too heavy. The homemade salsa is smoky and complex in flavor. It brings enough heat to satisfy even the most insane chili freaks, but it provides enough depth to those who are averse to spices and are likely to use salsa more sparingly. I was a little disappointed on the amount of beef in my burrito as it was combined with beans, but I'll live. My uncle on the other hand probably got too much chicken in his chimichanga, so maybe I just need to get that next time?  I loved it so much I came back for breakfast a few days later only to see they weren't open at 8 am. I should have checked the hours. Overall, this is a great place to hang out with some friends and enjoy an amazing meal."}
{"text":"Go here for the green chile beef and you won't be disappointed! It was a busy Sunday afternoon at Espos but the line moved fairly quickly.   We had the El Chapo burro and the carnitas burro. The El Chapo was filled with green chile beef, potato and cheese. I loved the green chile and the spicy kick to it which was about maybe 6/10 on the spiciness scale for me. The potatoes were a bit mealy tasting though and I would have liked an extra texture such as the addition of onion or pico de gallo to contrast with all the soft textures of the burro. The carnitas was decent, filled with slow cooked pork. The pork was moist as if it were cooked in a pot rather than roasted or fried like how I've encountered other carnitas in other restaurants.   The shop is pretty small with a few tables inside and a cute patio outside with more tables.   Overall it was a satisfying meal and I'd definitely stop by again to try more off their menu."}
{"text":"I love their salsa. Great food. I got a green chili burro, phenomenal. With chips and salsa that are to die for. great place."}
{"text":"Best local Mex I've eaten. Consistently good and plentiful. This is my go to place for a taco and a Corona. The family serve excellent food choice done deliciously. Love this place."}
{"text":"The food is always tasty and the staff is super friendly and helpful. Taco Tuesday is always a blast here!"}
{"text":"I will never return to Espos. Today I placed an order and had to wait over 40 minutes for 3 breakfast burritos. When I asked to speak to the manager, the girl behind the counter responded that no one was there, and no one could help.   It is really frustrating when you place an order ahead, and not only to be forgotten about, but completely neglected. When we got the food, it was overcooked and tasted horrible. It was clear they rushed, since they likely forgot about us. (The girl told me three times the food was being wrapped up.) I will be reaching out to the owners for a full refund. IMO you can get a better breakfast burrito at Adablertos. BEWARE!"}
{"text":"Arrived early to get my order in, but doors stayed locked an additional 10 minutes after opening time.  Ordered to breakfast burritos \"to go\", and waited 20 minutes for them.  Burritos were tasty but dry.  Heard so much about this place, but wasn't impressed.  Also, heads up - no restrooms, so empty your bladder ahead of time, if you go!"}
{"text":"Have always heard great things so I decided to try it! I was very disappointed! The guy who took my order was very rude and rolled his eyes when I asked to change something on my order. He also yelled at his staff and everyone could hear. The food was just ok. The taco shells tasted like they came from a box. The meat was very bland. You can definitely find better Mexican food elsewhere."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday's they 10 tacos for $10 and they are absolutely amazing!! We order about 30 or 40, depending on how hungry we are and is always worth it.  Always good to get there early because 15-20mins after opening, there is a line about to reach the door."}
{"text":"We have been long time Espo's fans and were so happy when they made their way back!  This is a small but awesome establishment with great food and really lovely people working there.  Tonight we came in just 10 minutes before closing and there wasn't a hesitation to take or our order or serve us (can't say that for every place).  The smiles were genuine and the service as fabulous as it would have been had we arrived at opening time.  Love our Espo's!"}
{"text":"Awesome tacos. Try anything with Chili Verde. Taco Tuesdays is a mob scene. Family run. Not a chain. Five stars for awesomeness!"}
{"text":"The best street taco shop I've found in AZ and I've lived her my whole life. Good beans, great pork and beef. Service is ok, but well worth the wait."}
{"text":"I went on taco Tuesday and had a blast! The 10 tacos for $10 and beer bucket for $10 was a steal! They have a DJ playing on Tuesdays and the owner told me that they were going to start having music every other Friday! (great idea). Great food and great environment! I've been searching for a good Mexican place for about four months now and am happy to say I finally found it! The owner was super kind and I can't wait to come back next Tuesday!"}
{"text":"FAVORITE PLACE EVER!!!! I come once a week for my Thursday dinner and I have never disappointed. Between their food and customer service, I would give them 10000 stars if I could. Will always receive my loyalty!!!"}
{"text":"The service is great. You get your food fast and portions are more than enough. Their green chili is good ! Went here because of Yelp rating and did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Food is great and a good value however there is something very annoying if you eat in as we did. I would give this place 5 stars but honestly the staff is not pleasant nor helpful. This is after eating here 3-4 times so its not just a bad day here. I never see anyone here interested in the customer. Lack of customer concern prevents a good place from being great.   If Espos wants to be great talk to your customers!  Also really the chairs in this place get dragged across the floor and are loud as hell and the tables are dirty and sticky. A present staff would notice this and I would not have to write this in a review."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. They have lots of drink options too that are really delicious. I had the machaca enchiladas and it was sooo good. REALLY SPICY though for me. Just as a heads up."}
{"text":"It was pretty good.  The place is adorable and it feels like it really is in Mexico.  All the customers seemed to be happy to be there.  I do want to try Taco Tuesday next time with a Margarita."}
{"text":"This was out first time at Espos and we tend to try many of the Mexican food places in town. I am on the hunt for good Mexican food, I haven't found a good place yet here in AZ. I would think it would be easy but sadly this place wasn't that good. I had a basic crispy chicken taco and my husband had a carne asada taco. We shared some rice, beans and chips and salsa too. The meat was bland in the carne asada, no seasoning at all. The chicken wasn't grilled like it says on the menu and the crispy taco was so soggy from the chicken juices it all fell apart. The rice and chicken was super salty and I am usually the person who salts stuff and this was way to salty for even me. The salsa was bland and no flavor a other than a red chili taste. I would skip this place if you are looking for good Mexican food, this isn't worth the energy."}
{"text":"It's a nice little place with good food and fast service. I've been there a couple of times and you don't want to miss it, if you like Mexican."}
{"text":"I had the burrito, very tasty, would recommend and go out of my way to eat again. Staff was very friendly. Very nice atmosphere, a little hard to find if you're not looking for it."}
{"text":"We were looking for something different and found this small place after going to a movie at the mall. Not wanting mall food we chose this place. I don't eat beef so was limited on choices. I had the chicken burro. Felt nothing special, typical Tex-Mex fare, not much flavor. Fast Tex-Mex food is not my thing. Go down the street to Abuelo's, more money, but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"It wasn't memorable.  We ordered the nacho supreme. This item isn't on their main menu? However, when we made our way up to place our order: we asked if they had or could do nachos. The cashier says \"Nacho Supreme\", \"Yes\"!!   Generally, their nachos come with ground beef & includes as a topping -black olive. Asked for Carne Asada & opted out of the black olives.  Waited about 15 minutes to receive our meal. It came in a round foil aluminum pan. Toppings: cheese, refried beans, fresh guacamole, canned jalapeños, & a huge dollop of sour cream. The chips were extremely thin; not great tasting & looked to be a bagged type- not fresh. The nachos itself even with all those layers were very bland.  They have one salsa that's mild and not to flavorful.  The outdoor patio had a nice appeal with plenty of cool water misters. Cute decor. The BAR is eye catching as you walk through the gate.   A plus, they do sell beer! Offer two style juices that look to be made in house.  While we ate browsed through their photos & a few of the previous Yelp reviews. Seems this place had more options/ appeal a few years ago that have changed with their new concept after reopening.   Dinning area is small  & location can be difficult to get in & out of as well."}
{"text":"Nohing to write home about. Pretty much like every other Mexican restaurant in the Phoenix area:  Sub-par."}
{"text":"The food is delicious I can't say enough. The service was great the food was great. I tried the cheese enchiladas. The carne Asada tacos,  and the chicken tacos. All super good. We are fans and will come back again and again."}
{"text":"They have real good burritos I got it enchilada style and it was good. A little spicy on the sauce."}
{"text":"Overall the food wasn't bad but it was just average.. I would personally go to burrito express instead if u are just interested in getting a burrito.. They taste better.. The only bad thing I do have to say is that they call u by ur number to pick up food but if your sitting outside you have no way of knowing if ur food is ready unless you occasionally check which sucks.."}
{"text":"Soooo good I had the green chilli beef quesadilla!!! To die for, my brother had the green chili beef, potato and egg burro with guac added btw homemade!! & hubby had chicken and carne asada tacos all excellent!! Will be coming back... also if you're first time tell them.. you get you're drinks free! :-) :-)"}
{"text":"Food is very mediocre. Hole in the wall kind of place but it's pretty clean. Location is pretty good and I think that's the only reason this place runs so well. Food was bland and quite disappointing.  Staff was friendly though."}
{"text":"So happy I found this gem in the rough!!!! Very authentic Mexican good!!! Had a Machaca & a grilled chicken taco!! Both were extremely delicious! The salsa bar offered multiple salsas: verde, pico de gallo w jalapeños , avocado sauce, radishes & grilled jalapeños, habanero salsa, & a squeeze bottle full of spicy red pepper salsa!!! Chips & salsa are al la carte but well worth the $3.25. They were served warm in a bucket. Tuesday's they offer all beers for $2, can't beat that! Highly recommend! Can't wait for the next time I visit, I'll be coming back here!!!"}
{"text":"I'm honestly puzzled why this place has the best ratings out of all the other Mexican restaurants in Chandler.   Yes, the food and service is good, but not really 4.5 stars good.   The prices are cheap, the food is tasty but it's just the standard fast food Mexican that's squarely a 3 star deal.   We had: The Machaca chili plate with spicy green chili sauce on the side. The green chili sauce was HUGE and flavorful and very spicy. Probably the best thing that came out. The refried beans were tasty and salty and had a good amount of cheese.   Machaca tacos were fat and full of meat, cheese and veggies. Very tasty. Hard crispy shell!  Carne asada and Carnitas tacos were a bit smaller than the Machaca and were served on soft corn tortillas. Less veggies (salsa Fresca style).   The burritos were big and full of ingredients.   Chips and salsa were fresh. Salsa had a nice kick but the serving size was tiny! The guacamole was really plain, I'm pretty sure it wasn't real avocado.   We ordered 5 flautas but only got 3 and my Machaca taco was missing until I asked for it.   The bathroom was clean and the outside has a nice patio to sit at.  In summary, it's a solid 3-3.5 star experience. It's fast food homestyle Mexican. Nothing great, nothing bad. But don't take anyone here on a date or for a family reunion!!   I didn't take pictures bc there really wasn't anything photo worthy to show."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a long time. Love the changes they have made. Nice patio. Food is still amazing. Best Taco tuesday anywhere. They give you lots of meat and have a real nice salsa bar. $2 beers and $2 margaritas. A must stop at for true aythentic Mexican food. 50 years in the biz says something!!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed lunch picked up here today for the first time. I ordered their Green Chile Burro with green sauce. OMG was it delicious! So fresh and flavorful .... Not much heat (which is good in my book) and a large portion for the price ($6.50ish). The chips were a bust and was not a fan of the salsa/hot sauce but that did not even matter to me. More room for my amazing burro! We will definitely be back ..... in fact I plan on taking the family there this weekend for some dinner! Good stuff! Try the Green Chile!"}
{"text":"Still a great family run place.  Slight changes.  The chicken burrito is chopped vs shredded.   The red enchilada sauce is spicier than I recall.   I too am excited that Espo's has returned."}
{"text":"Eh. Good service, bland food (meats, beans, rice) except for the guacamole and spicy salsas."}
{"text":"Kept driving by... Finally made it in. By other reviewers recommendations, went With the Green Chile burrito, enchilada style and the El Jefe, chimichanga fried, enchilada style. NOT DISAPPOINTED. Staff is super friendly and it's a cozy little spot to take in a bite. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"So good!  Ill be going to taco tuesday tommorow. Green chilie beef is awsome. Sooooo good"}
{"text":"Order the machaca burrito enchilada style. For the first time. It was so good and flavorful.. going back to espos really soon."}
{"text":"Don't know if I've reviewed this place or not yet, but I can't get enough of it. It's worth the drive all the way from Queen creek. Their green chili is the best!!"}
{"text":"We came across this place driving to the mall. I have to say this is such a great place if you haven't been you have to go. It's a small little joint but GREAT FOOD"}
{"text":"Found this place on a business trip. Had the green chili Burrito - one of the best burritos I've had! Got the basic one with no side of rice and beans. The portion size was perfect and the spice levels and flavor were awesome. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I call this gringo food. They don't even make a real horchata. Don't waste your time or money. There are many more authentic and gourmet Mexican restraints to try in the valley."}
{"text":"I have been driving by this place for years and I finally decided to stop one day, and I am glad I did!  I got the Carne Asada Chimichanga and my wife got the Green Chili Beef Chimichanga and they were both amazing! They give you a decent amount of sour cream, black olives and shredded lettuce on the side and let me just say they know how to deep fry a burrito.  Don't forget to grab some of their red and green hot sauce, pretty amazing as well!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I am a native of AZ and a lifelong fan of the unique style of Sonoran mexican food found here. In a sea of Macayo's and Garcia's sometimes it's hard to find the true Homestyle flavors that I have come to love , so it is not often that I am impressed with a new Mexican restaurant that I try. Espos is by far the best representation of Arizona - Mexican Cuisin that I have ever had. I Have now eaten here three times and each time I am more impressed.  Of particular note is the green chili beef. This is the best I've ever had and I make an incredible green chile myself! If you too enjoy the type of food  Arizona natives grew up on then you must try Espos! They also have great taco Tuesday deals."}
{"text":"Tasty authentic Mexican hole in the wall spot. I like the chicken enchiladas and green chile burritos here. Ok location and great service. They have seating in doors and out. You can also purchase flour tortillas (made in house) to go. Also, during the holidays, they sell tamales by the dozen."}
{"text":"Food was decent, but as some other Yelpers have said it's kind of bland.  The inside is crazy packed, which means that many of the tables were dirty.  Most of the restaurant was not that clean, but at least it wasn't insanely dirty or we would have eaten somewhere else.  The biggest problem I had with this place is that they got my order wrong.  Nevertheless I tried to eat the burrito and it was pretty greasy.  I know Mexican food is supposed to be like that, but I didn't want to gain ten pounds by just looking at the burrito.  Overall, there are better places to get your burrito fix (try los taquitos on Ray and the 101)."}
{"text":"This place is really good, tamales combo was great, came back the next day for taco Tuesday for 5 bucks 3 street tacos and a drink papow! Asked for double wrapped 2 tortillas which held everything together, awesome got packed right after 11am"}
{"text":"Comfortable atmosphere, menu well laid out, patient employees with first timers. I was recommended his place by 3 friends, was working in the area and had to stop by. I got the El Hefe and added Rice, Beans, Sour Cream, and Lettuce  with a Strawberry Jarritos on the side. Huge burrito mixed well but not wrapped as tight as I'm use to in Oakland. Still full of flavor and with the Green or Red Sauce it's on point. I will definitely be back soon with some friends."}
{"text":"I ordered the 3 taco plate. I was surprised that the taco shells were fried but they actually tasted good.  The ground beef was good and the salsa was very good too. The food takes a while to be prepared. I believe I waited almost 15-20 mins for my food. I ordered the food to go but that made no difference in the wait time. They prepare the food on a first come first serve basis.  The horchata was delicious. My only complaint was the beans. They lacked flavor and taste.  I was also surprised about the prices as they were on the expensive side for Mexican food.  Mexican food seems to be cheaper in Chicago than here."}
{"text":"3.5 stars Interesting place, good seating outside with lots of tables, fewer inside.   I ordered the machaca beef wet with green and red sauce. Tasty and tender. Will be back for another try."}
{"text":"I cannot believe this is my first time here after living in Chandler for 15 years!! Yowza it's awesome! Okay, so we ventured out on a Tuesday, Taco Tuesday that is. They said they have been here for 50 years.   There was a little bit of a wait to get to placing our order. But it was no big deal at all. They were moving quickly. Standing in line I knew it would be good. Lots of people in the restaurant and lots of to-go orders. Drinks came out quickly. I had enough time to hit the toppings bar, and have a couple sips of my drink and tada the food was ready.   You will likely meet the owner also- they are constantly taking care of the front of the house, cleaning up, and talking to guests. Definitely feels like family here. We had the 10 for $10 tacos, quesadilla, chips & queso with jalapeño. You choose your meat-ground beef, chx, carne asada, machaca beef, and carnitas. You can mix can mix and match however you like. They have a toppings bar to choose your salsas, etc. Or you can order a side of something else for toppings; guac, cheese, and so on. As well as the $2 margaritas. I've had margaritas from just about everywhere and these were great. They tasted so fresh, not that heavy syrup-y sweet and sour like other places. We tried both peach and raspberry. So good!   Initially, we sat inside and did not notice it being hot or needing a/c like another reviewer said. It was very comfortable. A table on the patio became available and we ended up eating on the patio. They had a DJ and music out there so the vibe was fun and relaxed. Just perfect.   I would go here ANY day of the week with family, friends, co-workers or anyone for that matter!! Their regular prices are really good and I can't wait to try more items next time."}
{"text":"Being a vegetarian it is really tuf for me to get a nice veggie burrito. This place did not disappoint me. Veggie burrito was awesome. I ordered it to be in enchilada style with hot sauce and a side of jalapenos. Do not let the ambience of the place let you down."}
{"text":"Great place! I got a basic egg potato and chorizo burrito. Very good! My wife got the Carnitas plate! Could be happier to go here highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Today it was so busy at Elmer's around 6. I felt bad for the people working because they were understaffed and working so hard! Some people were just being so rude and impatient. It's really sad to see people get frustrated waiting a little longer than usual to eat really awesome food! Have some respect for anyone working in the restaurant industry, it's not easy dealing with crappy people.   Eventhough the girls working took some rude customers, they managed to satisfy ALOT of people! El jefe burrito is my all time favorite! Thank you so much for making my night special and starting it with an incredible dinner."}
{"text":"Great tasting food and awesome prices.  Come hungry as even a quesadilla is huge."}
{"text":"This is not Mexican food. This is more texmex. The cucumber lemonade was full of sugar. The Meat in my Asada plate was very over cooked. The beans are from a can. The salsas have no taste. And they make you pay for chips and salsa. This restaurant is not Mexican food. Sadly disappointed since it had great reviews."}
{"text":"The green chili chimichanga is my fave! It's a cute little lunch spot. Counter service but it can be pretty busy. The remodel is better and they improved the parking lot as well. Will have to try their other dishes as well. It's a very low maintenance, no frills Mexican place. The churros were quite tasty as well."}
{"text":"Great flavor, great food. Very casual. It may not have ambience but you're not paying for that. The food is flavorful and authentic. Definitely worth it."}
{"text":"This a good stop for Mexican food, everything is good if not great! Had the El hefe Christmas style (red and green sauce) 2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in arizona 100% no doubt. I have had the best service in Arizona at this place I swear. They staff is great. It's always busy, and they somehow make the best food so fast ! I would recommend this place to anyone any day."}
{"text":"Espo's continues to impress with the Chili Relleno and the Machaca beef. The green chile in the Relleno was roasted perfectly and the outer masa was crisp that satisfied at the first and last bite. The spicy heat was appropriate to not over power the combined flavors. I'm very pleased to see this place has resurrected. I had such fond memories from high school, because they left a void that couldn't be filled."}
{"text":"I struggle with this place's food; some is good and some is okay. The tacos are good, I prefer the chicken soft tacos, but they don't use fresh guacamole which is disappointing. Overall it's good Mexican food and the portion size is large. So I gave this place another shot and the food seems to have gotten worse; personally I think it's awful."}
{"text":"My Fiance and I went to Espos for dinner this past weekend. We both enjoyed our dinners very much. Really good food and flavors. We loved the flour chips and salsa! The wait was a little bit longer than expected, but well worth it."}
{"text":"Love this place! Glad to have them back. Love the green chili, carnitas tacos and the ground beef salad. Every time I go, they've added more decor to make it a nicer place."}
{"text":"Love Espos! Bean and cheese burrito enchilada style with red sauce is always a staple for us! We have loved this place for years! Always coming back!"}
{"text":"My favorite food at Mexican restaurants is Chile Rillenos and even though it wasn't on the menu, they agreed to fix me a plate, which includes rice and beans and a flour tortilla. It was one of the best that I have ever had, perfectly crisp and with a really nice kick without being too strong. I will definitely be back and I'm glad the pleasant aroma drew me in here, even though I was initially planning to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I love both of their green chili and red chili plates. The red salsa they give in a ketchup bottle is amazing too. The place is order-at-the-counter style and grab your food when your number gets called. So service is speedy. Found my new favorite Mexican food place."}
{"text":"Amaziness!!!  They don't have anything close to this where I am from in the Pacific NW.  My physical therapist turned me onto this place (I hurt myself moving three large rolls of carpet onto a roof and through a second story window, but I digress).  I was staying at my family's VRBO in Prescott with my father and drove down to PHX for the Business Center Costco to stock up on supplies.  I decided to hop on over to Chandler to try this place out for dinner.  I am sure there are better places, or maybe not, but how often do you get personal restaurant recommendations from a local 1,200 miles away .  I got:  the Machaca, carne asada and carnitas tacos; the green chili beef chimichanga; and a cheese and Machaca enchiladas.  I have nothing but positives to say about the food.  The cashier was a bit short with me, but I can't blame her.  Being new I was as quick with my order as possible, but that was probably pretty slow and this place was slammed most of the time I was there.  Mostly with to go orders.  I may have to drive 1,200 miles to try this place, again.  It will be so worth it, though."}
{"text":"Some of the very best ready chili I have ever had. Flavor amazing not too hot just the right amount of spice very few can do it this well. Exceptional will be back"}
{"text":"Perfect Taco Tuesdays celebration. I go to Chandler for work and always make sure to have a quick meal at this place. Fun little place with authentic salsa bar and yummy food."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now and their food is great! Tuesdays they have walking tacos 10 for $10 Last visit I had a chicken quesadilla and it was more than I could eat! Ohh I tried all right! Great little place and has more outdoor seating than indoor, but that's what Arizona is all about enjoying the weather. And they serve Beer!  Dilly, Dilly!"}
{"text":"Carne was OK chicken bland but used toppings to make it better the shredded beef I think muchaca was super yummy homemade salsa was yummy my coworker told me to go glad I did"}
{"text":"Food is excellent and worth the wait!  If you don't have a lot of time, call and order ahead.  Prices are very reasonable for the portion size."}
{"text":"Espos was shockingly tasty. I picked up an order to go for some coworkers and I and while I was headed over there, I 100% expected it to be a little fast food place. It turned out to be a cute little restaurant. I tried their green chili pork burrito and it was ah- mazing! so much flavor at such a good price. Their salsa was also legit. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Updated review...tried this place again as the hubby really wanted the bean tostada again.  This time also tried a crispy chicken taco and the green chile burrito.  We are so happy to report that neither were too salty and both had great flavor.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great locally owned and operated. The staff is delightful and the food is amazing. Their sauces are all made from scratch and the meats are amazing. This is by far the best mexican food I have had in quite some time. Don't let the outside deter you this place is a gem!"}
{"text":"I'd come back here, time and again, just for the crispy taco plate!  To me, tacos to Mexican food are like chips to a sammie: you might get a taco on a combo plate, but the reason you ordered the meal was for something bigger and better. The taco? It's just a little more than a condiment. That said, I have no idea what drove me to order the 3-tacos (ground beef) w/ rice and beans on the side, but I think I was hoping for an unlikely gastric event -- a really tasty taco.  I won!!!  Crispy tortilla that was consistent throughout, and the remaining shell held its molded structure and didn't shatter like broken glass when you took a bite. I like that. I also appreciated that the taco was filled w/ meat, more so than lettuce, cheese and tomato. I like my taco old school, and the ground beef was flavorful and not dry.  The aforementioned dressings were chilled and fresh. Crispy, tasty goodness. I should have ordered 3 more!  The rest of the meal? Not too shabby. I liked the refried beans, but the rice was really salty. Also, my buddy grabbed the salsa (well, it was more of what I would call a \"red sauce\"), so I don't know if there were multiple options, but I prefer a chunky salsa over a sauce. Still, it had a good flavor and was not overpowering as a condiment. Guacamole was okay, and the portion of the side order was plentiful. Regrettably, I found the chips to be a tad over done, and too thick for my liking (I enjoy a lighter chip, cooked in fresh oil).  All in all, a really good meal, complimented by friendly service. I'll be back for the tacos . . .   Cheers! RL"}
{"text":"This is a great find. The food is delicious and freshly made.  I ordered the Carne asada. Not only was it cooked perfectly but they gave me enough for two people.  The staff are wonderful and gave good recommendations for their food.  I will definitely come back on my next trip"}
{"text":"It was ok! Went on a Saturday night, party of 5. This is a order at the counter and they call your number. Place was busy and line was out the door most of the time. We were excited because the reviews were great and had high hopes.   My girls had a quesadilla and chips with melted cheese and salsa. I specifically asked the guy if the salsa was on the side because and he said yes. The quesadilla was huge but I was disappointed that my other daughters \"chips and cheese\" had jalapeños all over it. She's four and will not eat that so we picked it all off instead of sending it back as the line was still out the door.  Two of us ordered the taco salad with ground beef and it was just ok. Wish we ordered sour cream and guacamole because it really had no taste. My husband ordered the chicken enchiladas, 2 ways. Both green and red sauce was good. I munched off his plates.   With the order comes a huge bucket of chips but I wish they gave it to you when you order and sit to wait for your food. We did not touch any of it and felt bad for wasting a whole bucket of chips.   We tried ordering the fried ice cream but they said they didn't have it and they needed to take it off the menu. Not sure if they no longer will be serving or just out for the night? We ordered the churros for a sweet treat after we were done and it was the best part of my meal.   Tons of Mexican restaurants around so I can't say we'll be back."}
{"text":"Fantastic food.  Very clean and friendly atmosphere!  Green chile is delicious! It was my first time but definitely not my last!  Great service!"}
{"text":"I only wish I could give them more stars.... This place only gets better.  I'm impressed with all they've done to spruce this place up.  The outside patio is expanded and looks amazing. I can't wait for it to be a few degrees warmer and I plan on really enjoying it!  They have plenty of umbrellas and trees for shade during the day and nice lights and heaters for the evening.    They have great tamales for Christmas.  We've gotten our Christmas Eve tamales here the last two years and they are delicious!    This is a local business that I love to watch. They seem to be doing well and I wish them all the best in the years to come."}
{"text":"Good Mexican food for the area. The staff was friendly and food service was fast , considering it was busy on a Friday night.The salsa was blah ... but the enchiladas and beans made up for it. I would definitely come back , whenever I'm in the area."}
{"text":"AWESOME LUNCH TODAY!!!  I must say that Espos really delivered today!  We had a group from work that decided to do lunch on the patio.  I'm glad that they chose this spot because I have been wanting try it out.    I ordered the Green Chile Plate and it was AMAZING.  The flavor of the green chiles was on point.  The portions were large and I should have saved half of it for later.  Unfortunately I could not put my fork down and devoured the entire meal.  A nap was the only thing I needed after this meal.   I had heard about their amazing Taco Tuesday and can't wait to come back for some tacos!  Thank you Espos for making my day!"}
{"text":"Delicious food ! Reminds me of my New Mexico food with the actual green chile and red chile ... no red sauce or green sauce which is the usual around here in Arizona . Love it especially the the green chicken enchilada plate  5 stars"}
{"text":"Read the reviews on yelp and wanted to stop by for lunch after arriving in Phoenix. Ample parking, quaint, rustic exterior with outdoor seating and misters. Inside its rustic and fun (b&w photos of various Mexican scenes framed on grill grates) with only 10 tables. Lots of menu options with variations of the assorted meats like carne asada, carnitas, etc. My husband and I got the El Jefe burrito filled with steak, lots of cheese and green chiles. Very tasty! My daughter got the taco salad served in a ginormous fried flour tortillas bowl. Wow! She's a big eater and she couldn't finish it! Chips and salsa were only 2.75 for a literal bucket of house made chips! Delicious and reasonably priced (burrito was 5.95 and taco salad was 6.29). Very good, I would definitely come back.\""}
{"text":"I ordered a carne asada burrito and the meat was burnt and way too salty. My uncles food was also overly salty. We didn't even finish the food because it was so bad."}
{"text":"I have only been here once so far, but from the first bite I knew this place is going to be a new favorite.  It is everything Mexican food should be.  The flour tortilla chips are so good!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came on our day off. We like looking for new things places to try. This place was really good. He food was hot and tasty. After many attempts to find good Mexican food in Chandler, we were pleased to come upon this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I am usually a veg head but next time I do crave meat, I will be coming to this place for my protein fix.  What to order? I ordered the chicken burrito which came with finely diced tomatoes and onions. The  burrito was shy of any other veggies which usually I would frown upon but the chicken was so tasty that I wouldn't complain."}
{"text":"Q:  What does a nosey pepper do? A:  Gets jalapeño business!  Established in 1955 and loved ever since!    Want a place that offers delicious food and a live DJ? Come to Espos! It's a small cozy eatery that offers both indoor and outdoor seating. I personally would recommend taking it to-go if you live in the area. Parking can be a little hectic but it just goes to show how big of a following they have.  Six words:  Machaca Enchiladas and Green Chile Plate. Their rice is super fluffy and tasty and the beans are done right. Toss on more cheese and their spicy green salsa and it's a meal that'll stick to your bones. Their red salsa is also done beautifully but the green salsa packs the heat. They make some wonderful plates that taste amazing. I still need to try their burritos but this is the place I go to for enchiladas.  So come to Espos for some good eats. Don't dilly dally and get your butt over there right now!"}
{"text":"Vacation...My wife visited here while on a business trip. She said so many wonderful things about this restaurant. While in paradise valley we made it a point to go here. It a small eatery with lots of character. The staff is friendly. Wife loves the green chili burrito. I ordered carne asada tacos with pico. The food had a wonderful flavor. My tacos were stuffed with steak and pico, each bite was flavor town. Rice and beans were okay I could have done without.  Each state makes beans and rice differently so I wont hold it against them.  Wifes burrito was also good super tasty pork with green chili's."}
{"text":"Simple good Mexican food, seems fresh. Took about an hour to have lunch there. Quality was above average. Had tacos & enchiladas. Flavor-wise was good, but not show stopping.   Pluses : convenient and pleasant tasting. No stomach upset afterwards.  Minuses: location not ideal, very busy intersection. Lot of traffic a few feet from the patio. Very casual atmosphere. Nothing upscale here. All food served on  foil pans or disposable plates, not a fan of that for eating in."}
{"text":"Shining gem of Chandler, AZ! Located just far enough away from the hustle and bustle of the Chandler Fashion Center to be relaxing, yet close enough to keep you in the action, this is that \"off the not-so beaten path\" restaurant you need to experience.  Flavorful and mouth watering food, such as, their chicken burrito (I added their green chili sauce) has kept me coming back for more. They serve breakfast burritos ALL DAY! Also offering tacos, flautas, tostadas, quesadillas, taco salads (and supra), enchiladas, chimichangas, and beers to ensure you get your money's worth.  Speaking of money, their prices are very good for the quality and portions. Friendly staff welcomes you with warm smiles as they take your order from the counter. Pick your table from the cozy inside or from the scenic patio (with bonfire pit) and after a few quick moments of enjoying the atmosphere, your food will be ready for you to devour!  Put Espo's Authentic Mexican Food on your \"must-go\" list!"}
{"text":"Ive read many reviews raving about their green Chile, and I've been dying to try it!!!  After debating where to get some lunch, I talked my wife into making the 25 mile trip to Chandler to try Espos. Once getting there I was shocked how small the parking is, it literally hold like 5 cars. We parked across the street and made our way in.   From the outside I didn't really know what to expect but once we walked in we were pleasantly surprised. It was very nicely cleaned and decorated. There isn't a ton of seating in there so I can see how it would get super busy and crowded in there. I wanted to try everything!!! I stuck to the the Green Chile and got the Chapo Burrito with beans and rice. My wife got the 3 tacos, and we got chips and salsa. They asked if it was our first time there and when we told them yes they gave us 2 free drinks. When we got our chow I was in heaven! The green Chile was delicious and has a small kick to it. It all bended together so well that I was in my own little world with El Chapo! The Beans and rice were a bit bland, I was happy that they weren't using uncle bens rice which is what most \"Mexican restaurants\" do. Adding salsa on it gave it some flavor. My wife's 3 tacos honestly were just ok, and im glad I didn't order that. I told her the reviews say \"stick to green chile\". I let her try my burrito and she loved it to. We even ordered another for dinner. If im ever in the area around lunch time ill def. come back to this spot. Friend service, great chow!!"}
{"text":"Lunch on taco Tuesday, with a couple of friends. Tried 4 different types of tacos. Now these are street tacos, small tortillas, but they are very generous with the meat portions. You help yourself to the condiments. Everyone was very pleased with their choices. My favorite was the carne asada. Salsas were tasty, chopped cabbage fresh. Iced tea was fresh brewed. Counter service, they call your number. Everyone was friendly. Pleasant patio was full, and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves. What a great place, can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Good food, bad service- waited 30 minutes for food. They forgot to make our order. Also it was 100+ degrees inside with fans. No AC in AZ!!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. I ordered the chicken enchiladas and although I enjoyed them the flavor didn't pop in my mouth. I would try it again."}
{"text":"Very authentic Mexican food at a place that I have driven by for years.  Had the El Jefe burrito and I am hooked.  Not sure why it took me so long to try Espos.  Hidden gem!"}
{"text":"I've been eating here since about 1975.  Went there again today to see what it was like in its latest incarnation.  The salsa is about as spicy as it always was.  Ordered carne assada tacos plain and a carne assada chimi.  The carne assada (in the tacos and chimi) has the texture of a meat product but not much flavor.  So the tacos weren't bad but they were bland (even plain tacos should have some sort of flavor).  As for the chimi since it came with lettuce, tomatoes, sour cream, cheese and guacamole, it tasted like those things.  Overall, a pretty big meh.  That being said, I'll probably go back if for no other reason than old times sake.    I gave them a 3 (agian, old times sake) but in reality it's closer to a 2."}
{"text":"This place has the best machaca burritos.came here on my lunch break hoping for a fast service . Although I spent my whole lunch waiting for a carry out order the was worth waiting.cant wait to come back and try more off there menu."}
{"text":"Yeah, just went to Taco Tuesday for lunch...muy bueno! Some confusion however - there were conflicting flyers around the property about the price, one sign said that Tuesday street tacos were $1.50 ea, another sign said that you get 3 tacos and a soda for $5. I don't really like to drink soda, but the girl at the counter was getting impatient that we were asking and she insisted there was only one deal they offered. Not even a big deal, we had the carnitas and carne asada tacos - and hell-yah! the salsa bar is very, very cool.  Must have been 5 or 6 different sauces, pickled onions, roasted serrano peppers, lime wedges, cilantro, chopped onions.... there was more but I forgot to snap a pic. One more important mention: the house salsa provided with the tacos was not to be found on the salsa bar....but it was soooo good, you not belief!!! As far as I could tell, there was lots of oregano in it, but not in an Italian way! Super-tasty, Ima return sooon with $10 and gets me a TACO PAR-TAY! Um, fiesta, por favor. The outdoor patio seating was perfect at this time of year :)"}

{"text":"This place is great.  Keep in mind its not a sit down restaurant, and pretty small inside, but the food is amazing and worth it.  Big fan of the machaca beef taco dinner.  Everything i've had there is good.  Dont be afraid to ask them for more salsa, and they do charge for chips.  Great lunch spot."}
