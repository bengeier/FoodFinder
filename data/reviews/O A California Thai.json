{"text":"I was looking for a good Hakka Chinese and Thai food which has to be halal(Muslims dietary restriction)
And I found it at California Thai. The crowfoot branch is restaurant style , the ambience was neat and clean.
The food serving is very generous. The staff is friendly.
I tried hot & sour soup and general Tao chicken with sticky rice. It was yummy."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. We ordered Pad Thai and Pad Se Ew (with \"normal\" broccoli instead of the advertised Chinese broccoli). Both were bad, the Pad Thai especially. Very bland and the tofu tasted like water 

($5 delivery fee and a 50 min wait.)"}
{"text":"We ordered green curry and Shanghai noodles; they both tasted pretty good. The rice that came with curry smelled really amazing too. The prices could be a little more reasonable though.
The waitress was very friendly and warm too."}
{"text":"Stumbled onto this place as I was looking for a quick lunch. The story of my life. Thought I would try it out since I love Thai food. 

California Thai is located in Crowfoot right in the main fast food strip (Right by Chianti's )  and is new. It's a casual cafeteria style restaurant and is clean, modern and smelled delicious when entering.  I arrived close to lunch time and right when I walked in I was greeted by a bubbly cashier. Wish I got her name. I looked over the menu and they have a great selection and variety here. I asked the cashier what she would recommend? She asked me a few questions of what I usually order at Thai places as well as what am I feeling like? She recommended a few items and I settled on two

I settled on the chicken coconut soup and Thai veggie rice with pineapple. All items are made fresh and with the open concept type of kitchen, you can see through the glass how it's done. Both items were delicious and since I requested the veggie rice to be spicy, the lovely cashier advised me if I didn't like it or it wasn't spicy enough, let her know and she would have something else made for me. Love that. They also have child/kids meal items, which is great to know if you are dining with little ones.

She rung me up and advised me since its lunch and my first time here she took 10% off my bill. BONUS! Staff was friendly (Cashier and one of the cooks), prices very reasonable and they do dine in and take out.

Will be back since there is so many other items I want to try on this menu."}
{"text":"Finally good Thai food in the Crowfoot area :D Tried this location in for the first time today with family (it has only been open since March 23rd) and I am definitely going to order from them again! The service was very friendly and the food was delicious. We ordered the beef satay, hot and sour soup, massaman curry, and coconut rice. So good! A lot of different curries, stir fries, noodle dishes, vegetable dishes, soups, etc. Gluten free options as well! Open every day and till late too. Check them out! I will note that I put 4 stars because I like my curries hot and I feel mine was a little tame but hey, everyone has different spice levels."}
{"text":"New place in Crowfoot, we were hungry and went in during off hours but there were still people inside eating, and it smelt great. So why not? That's always a good sign right??
The staff were super friendly and took our order right away asking if we had any questions about the menu. 
We ordered Coconut soup with chicken, coconut rice and salt and pepper prawns, and a noodle dish. All came out super fast hot and tasting fresh. We wish we had known that the salt and pepper prawns already came with rice or we would not have ordered extra. 
All the food was very tasty, and if I was back in crowfoot I would go back. The portions were big, and both of us left very full with leftovers.  
The staff came by to see how we were doing and brought containers for us to pack up our leftovers with and a bag to take them in. 
Great experience, nice clean bright restaurant. I hope it does well for them."}
{"text":"I was out running around the Crowfoot area and it was lunch time.  After a quick check of the \"nearby\" section of the Yelp app, and seeing the highly reviewed California Thai Fusion Cuisine, it was an easy decision.  

I walked in the door and the vibe of the place hit instantly, high expectations right away!  I looked over the menu on the boards above the counter.  It turns out that is only a part of the full menu, which they had available in both hard cover and take out menus.  The staff member was very friendly and informative with my questions.  I decided on the Chicken Pad Thai with Szechuan sauce.

I sat and waited about 8 minutes when she brought out my tray.  The only thing I didn't like was the cafeteria style tray with the disposable plate.  At least there was no plastic cutlery.

My vermicelli noodles were piled high, tossed with enough chicken and vegetables to see that it wasn't a place that just filled you up with noodles.  The sauce coated everything but was not pooled at the bottom, and it smelled delicious!  There was a small container of crushed peanuts on the side, which quickly found its way onto my pad thai.

Now, I mentioned the tray and plate, I got over it really quickly when I tasted it.  They could have served it in a bucket and I would have gotten over it!  What a delicious meal.  The Szechuan sauce was spicy but not over the top hot, with an edge of sweetness.  A squeeze of lime over it and it was perfect with a little hit of acidity.  There were big pieces of nicely cooked chicken, crunchy sweet peppers, green onion and other nicely cooked veggies. The noodles were cooked perfectly, which is nice since vermicelli is often overcooked The portion was just a bit too big for me to finish, although I sat there for 10 minutes after I was done still picking at it, making sure I only left a bit of the noodles.  

I took a copy of the take out menu home so I could plan out my next visit to California Thai.  If you are in the Crowfoot area, check it out.  If you aren't in the area, it's worth the trip to come!"}
{"text":"Really good food at a reasonable price! The waitress was very nice and attentive and the food came out quickly and tasted great. They serve lunch until 4 (though we went at 5 and she said we could still order the lunch size at the lunch price so that was nice!), and the dinner portions are big enough to share. 

I haven't tried it but they also have hakka food here, which is hard to come by in Calgary. 

One star off because the bubble tea was way too sweet for my personal preference (I tried the mango). 

Other than that, no complaints. I'd definitely recommend stopping by for a chill lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"Did dinner takeout at California Thai in Crowfoot.  Very good customer service.  I had placed an earlier call for a takeout at 4 p.m.  When I got there about 5 mins earlier, they were starting on my order.  They made sure that my food was hot and freshly cooked when I got there.  I didn't mind waiting.  It gave me a chance to look around the new restaurant.  Some booths and lots of tables.  It's like a cafeteria-style restaurant with an open kitchen.  I like the white elephants with their trunks up high.  You know, it brings good luck if the elephants with raised trunks face the door/window, which they were!  Lots of dishes to order from.  

My order consisted of:
- Chicken Coconut Soup - Creamy and coconutty soup with chopped up lemongrass and a Red Thai chilly. 
- Pad Thai - Golden sauce - A hefty portion of pad Thai noodles with plump, juicy shrimp.
- Basal Fish Yellow curry - Delicious fish curry with chopped up green peppers, tofu, red onions.  
- Stir-fried Green Beans with peanuts - I like this!  Very well done.  It says green beans but they are actually snap pea pods.  Delicious, nonetheless!
- Big portion of steamed white rice to eat with the fish and the green beans.

The heat was all just right for me.  I even got extra red chili sauce as I like it spicy.

Turns out this restaurant is owned by the same owner up by the Costco in Beacon Hill.  

Will be back!"}
