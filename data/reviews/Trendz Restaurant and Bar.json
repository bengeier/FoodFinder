{"text":"Sicilian sandwich was great!  Potato salad seemed fresh and homemade.  Had to get food to go, was ready in 15 min.  Bar tender was extremely nice, menu unique and big.  Hope it stays in business long enough to try more items!  The \"t\" reminds me of a creepy cross that a modern mega-church would use.  Luckily there is not any type of cult-church thing going on inside the restaurant!"}
{"text":"The menu was impressive as it has a lot of great choices.  I have to go back to explore it further.  The food was served quicker than I expected and hot and tasty - although yes a little greasier than expected.  I'm sure they will work on that.  It was a nice and warm environment.  I was surprised that they had ran out of Bud Light on draft on a Saturday.  Also, they probably need to pay attention to the dusty bathroom.  It was quite obvious.  Never the less - I will return and probably more than one."}
{"text":"Stopped in last night with my wife to see about this new place in Broadview Heights which took the place of our beloved Beef O'Grady's.  Overall we thought it was decent.  The atmosphere was casual.  Not a huge fan of the paint coloring, but not offensive.  The waitress was friendly, though she forgot to bring the coleslaw for my meal.  I got the all you can eat Perch special for $9, which was a pretty good deal.  Freshly fried perch w/ a thin corn meal coating.  Came w/ freshly cut fries which were good.    My wife got the Sunrise burger- it was decent.  Egg was a overdone compared to the Lola burger, which we love.  Came with great sweet potato fries.  The biggest disappointment was the \"strawberry shortcake\" that we ordered.  It had a soft biscuit instead of shortcake, a generous serving of normal vanilla ice cream, probably less than 2 strawberries cut up on top and a gross slathering of strawberry \"sauce\".  There was some whipped cream on top as well.  A real disappointment- more strawberries and less gross strawberry sauce would be a huge improvement on this dish.  Fortunately it was only $4, so it wasn't super expensive.  All in all, I think that it was a decent place.  I wouldn't mind coming here to watch the game.  Might be awhile before we try it again.  Also, I thought that the tendency of the place to name many of its items with a \"z\" instead of \"s\" was a little annoying.  Just a style thing, I guess.    Hopefully this place takes off and will be here for years- there aren't enough independent restaurants in Broadview Heights!"}

{"text":"I put off writing this review because our first visit was SO atrocious that after speaking with a manager, she asked that we first give them another chance.   We never got an opportunity because yesterday I noticed they are closed. Can't say I'm surprised if our only visit was any sort of indicator. Too bad, too, because this area really needs a few more good options.   Here's a suggestion to anyone considering opening a restaurant in this space: DO NOT DO IT. And I'm 100% serious. There are without question what I call \"Locations of Death,\" and this is one of them. If an excellent chef like Jihad Hachicho could not make it work there with the excellent Aura, I'm not sure anyone can.  I think Trendz is at least the third failed restaurant in this space. It's tucked away in a corner of a virtually empty strip mall--although to their credit, Cozumel is still there and keeps knocking 'em dead.  Just don't ask me how.   Regardless, goodbye Trendz. We hardly knew ye. Thank goodness"}
{"text":"This was a great find. Just needed to eat, but needed free wifi...not easy to find in the Cleveland burbs! Stumbled upon this place and was glad I did. They have a little patio on the side which was nice but unfortunately didn't receive the wifi, so I sat inside.  Their menu is more gastropub than fried pub food (although they have that too!)  I was totally expecting microwaved food, so you can imagine my shock when these heavenly looking pierogies came out. Can't complain about the service either. Server was very attentive.  I do hope this place makes it. Give it a try!"}
