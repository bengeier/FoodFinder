{"text":"A superb dining experience.  Much better value than any place in downtown Toronto.  Fantastic live jazz music for a great ambiance too."}
{"text":"Went to Chiaro Ristorante to celebrate my 30th birthday with family.  The restaurant has an extensive wine list, and our server was highly experienced in wine pairings.  We selected grilled calamari, octopus, lamb, and cured meats and cheese for our appetizers, as well as Caesar and arugula salads. These were perfectly paired with J. Lohr Chardonnay. We also got pizza for my son, and it was custom made to suit his preferences.  We got a Toscana red wine for the main course dishes - T-bone steak and Filet Mignon. The meat was cooked perfectly; we asked for medium rare.  For desert, we had creme brûlée, tiramisu, and apple tart - all were presented beautifully.  The ambiance in the restaurant is very elegant. It is a fine dining restaurant with a very authentic Italian feel to it."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favour & go to Chiaro ASAP. I can't praise this restaurant enough. Firstly the atmosphere is beautiful. I've been a couple of times & both times it was a warm summer night & the front windows were open with a light breeze coming in swaying the curtains & it felt like I was in a place far away. The first time I went there was live music & it was fabulous. The service is spectacular. We've had Johnny both times & he is knowledgeable and personable. Christina the manager is wonderful & wants your dining experience to be special. Now for the food - WOW!!! DELICIOUS!! ORIGINAL!! There is so much love that goes into every dish. Your mouth will be so happy after every bite. Octopus appetizer is beyond any octopus I have tried. It's very hard to find a restaurant that cooks octopus properly. After you have this appetizer, it will be hard to find anything as good. The fried calamari are perfectly done. My friend had the lamb chop appetizer & commented on how great they were. We've tried 3 of the 5 salads & they are all extremely yummy. The flavours are original and you can't go wrong with any of them. All of our mains have been incredible. We've had the seabass, salmon with lobster & the salt coated fish. They are all delicious and I would recommend them all. If you are there on a night that they have the salt coated fish, order it. It is something different & it melts in your mouth!  The deserts...I don't eat dessert, however I had to try one since everything else was so phenomenal. I had the Vanilla creme brulee with the nutella ganache. Oh my goodness!! It was so sinfully delicious.  You can tell there is a lot of pride in the presentation because it is outstanding. Every dish is a work of art. There are many good middle ground restaurants that are good but this place is special. It is a diamond in the rough & somewhere that you must try. You won't be disappointed & you will be talking about the food for days."}
{"text":"My husband an myself, had finally had the opportunity to have dinner at this lovely place. I won't lie when I say it's not always easy to get a table here. We're always looking for a classy/ jazzy feel with a good vibe, great wine selection and live music. This place is very conveniently located in Woodbridge, where we live, so we don't have make the drive out to downtown.  We really enjoyed the classic, tasteful, yet simple design with a hint of sexy. The service/ staff were that WE had were very professional and prompt, also knowledgable. Not only on their menu, but we're able to cater to my 'gluten free needs' The presentation of the food was very clean and sophisticated, and the music really helped set the tone. Especially once the live band started the play, the outdoors came to you! (They opened the whole side of the restaurant, we all got to enjoy the lovely summer air) although the cigar smoke from nearby was not too much of a bother to ME, it may not appeal to everyone.... The only reason I just could not have myself give the restaurant a full 5 stars, was mostly due to the flavours of our main course. Although my husband and I both had different meals ( stuffed chicken and sea bass) we both felt that it was either too rich, or was missing something... Other the flavours did not marry well... We just could not put our finger on it.... Or perhaps we were simply full from our appetizers....  We will most definitely return in the near future and try more off the menu!  Although the pictures from... What I believe was from the previous Vincento looked extremely appetizing! And I wished they kept some of those items   Over all a beautiful evening and a lovely experience."}
{"text":"One thing Italian families never do is go out to eat at an Italiano ristorante. I've been eyeing Chiaro for quite some time now. It caught my attention by their social media feed on Instagram (mouth watering including the feed from Motorino) and the clientele that went over to this restaurant religiously (Big Cannoli). I enquired about having a private function here and decided to finally go in today to see what it's all about. This place is about 40min from my house and it is definitely worth the drive.   Chef Dom is passionate about what he does and you can tell by the art that's delivered to your table. All of the ingredients are carefully thought out and perfectly balanced. Your palette will be appreciative of the effort he put into his food. Italian always cook with so much love and every course we had from appetizer to dessert did not disappoint.    This is the type of restaurant that you can go to and ask the chef to make you whatever he recommends. He might bring something to the table that you've never tried but it doesn't matter because of how delicious his dishes are. Everything is authentic and home made.   My family is Italian, I've been to Italy three times and Chiaro ristorante I would highly recommend to anyone that enjoys sitting down for dinner and be awed by what you taste.  Below is what I had at the restaurant   ==================  Cominciare: Arancini Rotolo: These are the Italian version of sushi rolls. Golden to perfection stuffed with prosciutto / fiore di latte/ basil leaves and served with a warm garlic tomato sugo Grilled Octopus: No chewy seafood here, well balanced and deliciously grilled.  Baby Lamb Chops server on top of a garlic mushroom caramel sauce that is to die for. The crispy Parmesan polenta was a surprise I wanted to keep eating them  Primi: Spaghettini Carbonara - Perfectly al dente with a flavourful carbonara that makes you feel like your in Rome. Simple good quality ingredients you can taste the love that was put into the dish.  Dolci: The dessert made my taste buds so happy. The blood orange meringue will be one I'm going to crave for a very long time. The sweetness and crunchiness from the shortbread then a burst of citrus from the blood orange that instantly cleansed your palette was one of the most beautiful melody of flavours I've ever had in a long time. He also served a modern remake of the carrot cake dessert with mascarpone. Made me think of a spice latte. I wish I had more room to keep eating and order a second round of desserts."}
{"text":"Went to this place for a friends' birthday this past April.  We started off with grilled octopus, and arugula salad. My husband and I have tried many variations of grilled octopus around the world in our travels and this one by far was the BEST grilled Octopus that we ever had. So tender and delicious I still think about it!   For our main courses, I had rabbit risotto and my husband had spaghetti a la carbonara. The risotto was incredible. The spaghetti was also good but had way too much bacon/pancetta (this is subjective as some love lots).  The only complaint we had was that there was no dessert left at the end of the night to order! That's the only reason why I had to give this place four stars instead of five. I think they were really busy that night and that's why.   Love the live music and ambiance.  I will definitely be here again (especially for dessert)"}
