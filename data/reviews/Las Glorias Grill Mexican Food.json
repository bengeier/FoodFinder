{"text":"Delicious food at a great price. I really like the pomegranate margarita. Everyone was very friendly and service was attentive. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This one of the best places for Mexican food this side of town. I love coming here, but today the service was under par. Nevertheless I will return as the food is superb."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot, been coming here for years.  The key word is \"consistent,\" there is no shortage of decent mexican food in PHX but I find that the quality/service often varies from visit to visit.  Las Glorias is always tasty and the service is fantastic.  Like all places there are some dishes that really stand out and in this case its the Green Chile burrito - best green chile around.  If you are a vegetarian, i highly recommend the spinach and mushroom enchilada."}
{"text":"Las Gloria's would have gotten as many stars as possible until our last visit on the first Friday afternoon of August 2015,  but it was not the same.  The  server was uninformed regarding the margaritas.  She was confused by the request for one of the 3 different types of tequila listed on the sign on the wall. The  next server told me the  sign advertising  99 cent margaritas was old and hadn't been removed.  I  asked for management;  I was told \" he\" was busy  making a big platter, and could not speak with me.  I persisted.  When she returned from the  kitchen she  said \"he\" would be out later.   I was left standing at the  service bar.  Then 2 servers rolled their eyes at me giggling as they scurried away.  Later, a man (he didn't introduce himself) came to the  table.  He said he would not be able to sell us  blue tequila margaritas as posted on the sign because it was too expensive.   He  showed me a bottle of an expensive blue tequila from a different company that was not the same thing as the sign with pictures and words listing white, gold, and blue tequilas.  He told us he was personally making my blue margarita, and bringing it to the table.  Never happened.  What is going on in this place?  It was the best neighborhood restaurant.  Now I'm not recommending it to anyone because of terrible customer service.  Embarrassed? They  should be."}
{"text":"Been going to Las Glorias for almost 18 years now. Great service, wonderful and imaginative menu. Thursday night is \"taco night\". Can't beat it!"}
{"text":"I will put this as simply and in as few words as possible.  If you don't eat here every wednesday and thursday you are an idiot.  wed- 99 cent fish tacos, 1.50 corona thurs- 1.25 assorted tacos, 99 cent margarita  see you there"}
{"text":"We have driven past here many times and finally decided to try it. AMAZING! The food tastes just like my in-laws family makes. Perfect beans and rice, the red chili beef and spinach enchiliadas were on point! This will become our new go-to spot!"}
{"text":"def the place to go for breakfast.  breakfast special is amazing and food comes out hot and fresh. our new favorite place for Mexican food.  they open at 9am"}
{"text":"Excellent Food! Awesome green chili pork!! I will be back very soon for sure!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food,  the selection was great the service was a bit slow and I had to seat my family my self but overall it was ok, all day every day 99 cent margaritas."}
{"text":"Breakfast burrito is ok, I always call in my order and they seemingly charge me a dif price for the exact same thing every time I go. If your in a pinch and need some decent Mexican this is your spot."}
{"text":"This place is a diamond in the rough. I would have never thought to try it if it weren't for my buddy dragging me there for dollar margaritas. It is tucked in a corner behind a Circle K with a big sign that reads \"MEXICAN FOOD\".   Oddly enough, living in Arizona it is hard to find really good Mexican food (who woulda thunk, but it's true). I have to say the food at this place is very good, some of the best Mexican food I have had in AZ. I have had the fish tacos (fresh and tasty) and a chimichanga (is that even traditional Mexican?) and it was delicious. The chips and salsa are very good, but the bean dip is out of this world.   The atmosphere is perfect for a Mexican Restaurant. It's nothing you need to dress up for, but it's not run down by any means. It's a good place to go with the family or a special someone for a good meal or even with a group of friends for a good time with a little green liquid help with salty rims.   Cheers"}
{"text":"First of all I want to say that I am a super snob when it comes to Mexican food......And this place is a solid ten!!! I don't need the atmosphere to be amazing I don't need the waitress to make sure I'm fine I have a wonderful family to keep me occupied. So with that in mind I would have to say this place has the best Tamale and food  in town. It is a difficult task to make me happy with a tamale soooo many restaurants mess em up and this place makes em deeeeelicious. Enchiladas..... deeeeelicious!! The salsa deeeeelicious!!! 1.99 margaritas??? Come on!!!! it doesn't get better than than that. I would give them 10 stars if you could. If your looking for atmosphere or service at a 1-2 stars price then stay home. But this place is the best Mexican Food in Phoenix"}
{"text":"Holy sheep, this is awesome Mexican food!  When my husband and I travel, we always look for a great Mexican spot.  We live in Texas so I've become a bit of a mexican food snob only wanting the best (doesn't matter if it's fancy or hole in the wall).  I found Las Glorias looking at online reviews and boy it didn't disappoint!  Don't be fooled by the storefront.  The food is amazing!  The corn tortilla seem like it's homemade and just nothing I've ever tasted.  It's goood!  The salsa had a great flavor but I'm used to the hottest of salsa so it was a bit disappointing and they don't have anything hotter unless it's habanero sauce.  The fajitas was very delicious and nice sized portions! It was so good we contemplated eating there a second time on our vacation.  Whether you're a traveler passing by or you live in the area, GO TO THIS PLACE!  It's extremely good!"}
{"text":"The location looks scary from the outside but the service is great and very friendly. You can't judge a book by its cover. Food is amazing, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Good service, tasty salsa and chips, and pleasant atmosphere. Portions are fair but not great. Prices a little steep but not outrageous. Would visit again if I was on that side of town."}
{"text":"This place is not good.  At all.  I got the Green Chile Burrito and my friend got the Carnitas.  Both were fairly flavorless and the meat was a bit dry/tough.  I really have no idea how this place has a 4 star rating.  That being said, the staff is very friendly and the service is great.  The food just isn't very good."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp while in an unfamiliar area. Had apps and Margs, they were so pretty we took pictures of them!  Only reason it's not a 5 star is I am not certain the Margs even had alcohol in them. Had 2 ( and they are big!) and walked out without the slightest effect.   Don't let the outside fool you. Inside is clean and food was great!"}
{"text":"Brought my parents here after reading all the positive reviews. They loved it! I had Enchiladas Suizas, they had fish tacos vegetarian burritos. Everything was very good!!!"}
{"text":"My mom and I stopped in after finding Las Glorias Grill on Yelp. Mom was looking for some standard Mexican fare--tasty but nothing too insanely spicy--and this fit the bill. She enjoyed her chicken fajitas and I was pleasantly to surprised by my vegetarian burrito. It was flavorful and came with vegetarian frijoles de olla. Service was a little distracted at times (they were very busy) but always friendly. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great place.  We live in Scottsdale.  Good to find a place actually wasn't that far away.  Good authentic food u don't find in Scottsdale at a fraction of the price.  Will return."}
{"text":"I work close by and have eaten at Las Glorias several times before and always enjoyed it. Then I saw the sign for $1.25 tacos on Thursday. After that day between 4 and 6 of us eat there every Thursday and it has become our Taco Day tradition. The food is excellent, the service is wonderful, and 99 cent margaritas can't be beat. Whether you are there for your own Taco Day or just want some good mexican food, Las Glorias should be your first stop."}
{"text":"We were in from San Diego and all 6 of us loved our food. The portion sizes were huge, we could have shared. The service was excellent. And you can't beat 99 cent margarita's!! When we're in Phoenix again we'll definitely go here."}
{"text":"Our students love this restaurant!  When they come for Reiki, Reflexology and other classes, they love going for lunch at Las Glorias.  The salads with grilled chicken breast are delicious and a little of the bean dip completes an \"out of this world\" lunch...just perfect for an afternoon of energy healing.  Thank you for taking such good care of us! Marsha Craven & Mary Ellen Brown of Healing Arts Connection."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Great price. I had the Tacos Don Chuy plate. Two carne asada tacos with beans (de la hoya), rice and guacamole. Not rocket science but well served and delicious. Good salsa too. Go."}
{"text":"Best green chili in the southwest.  Wonderful and friendly staff. The green chili cheese crisp was perfectly cooked and wonderful green chili flavor. What a hidden gem"}
{"text":"By far the best, most authentic Mexican food in phoenix. I could eat there everyday"}
{"text":"It's just ok. I was enticed by a coupon for buy one get one free, so if you're interested in checking this place out...check your money mailers! I've only been for lunch, so I won't speak for the dinner menu.... It's not the place for a power lunch and I don't think the food will overly impress anyone.  Most items on lunch menu are $7 and are a good value.  It's your standard tacos and burritos, but they also have stand-outs like shrimp enchiladas.   The service hasn't been fantastic, but I'm sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"So glad to find GREAT Mexican Food within walking distance of my house. This is right up there with La Piñata for my favorite Mexican Food places in AZ. Las Gloria's imprinted itself on my mental food map tonight!!!"}
{"text":"I eat a lot of Mexican food...This place by far has the best Carne Asada plate that I've ever eaten. Salsa and margaritas are great as well!!! I drive 30 minutes to get there but it is well worth the journey."}
{"text":"Chips and salsa were great.  Excellent food and service.  We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Great food. Friendly staff. Also, couldn't help noticing how clean they keep it! Impressive!"}
{"text":"We were exhausted from traveling all day, and  needed to eat!!  The 2 Mexican restaurants closer to our hotel did not have good reviews,  so my wife looked up other locations, and we decided to try this place.  I am so glad we did!   We started out with chips and salsa, and a warm bean dip with a little kick. It was excellent! The wife had a house Margarita which she said was super strong. She had fish tacos which she said were some of the best she's ever had. I went with a chicken burrito, and I was very satisfied with it. I would come here again..."}
{"text":"Nice little hole in the wall.  Wonderful beans and salsa. Don't let the light rail construction keep you away.  We will definitely be coming back again."}
{"text":"3 years since last review.  Still our favorite for Mexican food.  Truly pleasant and happy staff.  Have never disappointed with the food.  In 8 years now.  The carpet has been replaced with tile, but it's still easy to have conversations, even when it's packed."}
{"text":"I eat here quite a bit...meet with the fella's there on thursday nights.  I usually get the carne soft tacos which are specially priced on Thursdays at $1.50 which is awesome!!  I went off the beaten path and tried a trio-combo which was the \"#10\" that had two sour cream chicken enchiladas and one shredded beef taco with a side of refried beans and rice.   Wow, it rocked.  The enchilada and the cream sauce had great flavor cooked right on point.  The taco shell was freshly-made crispy and just the right amout of cheese, lettuce and meat mix.  And our server was, as always the professional and beautiful Cecelia.  Overall great Mexican food."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times with my mom because she really likes it, but overall I wasn't impressed.  The food was tasty, but the service was atrocious.  It was busy the last time we went, but we stood around inside the door for probably 10 minutes before an employee even noticed us.  There were other parties waiting, too.  You just had to stand around and wait for someone to bother seating you in one of the open booths.  Everyone was satisfied with their meal.  I've had the spinach tacos, which were very tasty, and I appreciate having a veggie option that wasn't a run-of-the-mill bean and cheese or chile relleno.  (I've had their chile relleno and wasn't impressed by it.)  But no one refilled our drinks the whole time or checked on us.  Not even once.   Maybe this is better when you go at a less busy time, but the food isn't mindblowing enough to make it worth the lousy service on a Friday night."}
{"text":"My family's favorite Mexican food joint in Phoenix. We have been coming here since it opened. The food is consistently delicious."}
{"text":"Loved it.  It's definitely not how it looks from the outside, inside. It's very nice inside with plenty of seating and great service.  The food is delicious as well.  I always order the Chicken Chimi but everyone agrees all their dishes are equally delicious.  Great food,  great service!"}
{"text":"Happy hour soft tacos (plate of 3) had a few near-microscopic cheese crumbles and three small tomato chunks. I asked for hot sauce with \"please\" on top and what was to be a 30-second favor turned into me going up to the counter and asking for a bottle after several minutes. There were only 2 other occupied tables in the place. Gorgeous servers, but they didn't care about us gringos and I felt dismissed, ignored, resented and stiffed. IF I return with my friends in the future by way of being out-voted, I'll give it another chance and update my review hopefully for the better. If NOT for the better, you can bet you'll hear about it here."}
{"text":"Ate there for the first time.  Had the shrimp ceviche tostada, super delicious. I will definitely order it again."}
{"text":"This place is very good. I would go  a 5 for the price but having gone here no less than 40 times I can tell you that the service is only OK. Sit down nothing happens often for 5 minutes, does not matter if its only you and a few other tables. NO chips salsa nothing until the waitress comes to get your drink order. TRY the spinach cheese dip it is 5 star! Also the special chicken and beef enchiladas (they will split them one beef one chicken). Also the Colorado chili is superb."}
{"text":"First time coming here & I can say the food is good. They have daily lunch specials for 5.99$, comes with rice & beans. The ladies here were really nice too!"}
{"text":"We have been looking for some good Mexican food since we got here to pheniox. The wait staff was extremely friendly and very helpful with the menu. I really enjoyed the drinks and the meal was fresh and filled the whole plate. My gals was just as good. If you need a spot to get the real deal then this is it ."}
{"text":"So good! Good house margaritas st a great price. I had a burrito which was super yummy and hubby had enchiladas which he totally enjoyed. I would highly recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"Are 1st here..  I order there classic margarita my order there Menudo with all the fixings.. The waitress recommend the steak and grill"}
{"text":"This Mexican restaurant is in an older and tired strip mall. That's your sign that the food will be good. We've been here twice, and both times we've been impressed. In fact, this time around it seemed like the owners had cleaned up the place a bit.  The first time we came, it smelled a little bit stale and we almost left. This time around, it didn't have any bad smell at all. And the service is fantastic. We got our meals very quickly. When you sit down, you're given chips, salsa, and yummy refried beans.   If you're into seafood and Mexican, this is the place to come. In addition to shrimp cocktail, they also have an octopus cocktail which is closer to ceviche. It has chunks of deliciously boiled octopus. I've had the whole fried fish twice; it's not greasy. It's nice and crispy, the bones are delightfully crunchy. And, it had the head attached. I grew up in a Korean American household where we ate offal. I enjoyed it then, and now.   Their pricing is pretty cheap, considering the awesome seafood options on their menu. The fried fish came with a sizable Caesar salad, rice, and beans for $13.99."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem!! Service was awesome & the food was even better! All of Victoria's suggestions were perfect.  You really cant order anything bad here! Such a cute family restaurant. And you cant beat the WEDNESDAY $1.25 fish tacos and $1 margaritas!!! I'll never go to another mexican restaurant in the valley!"}
{"text":"Hard to beat $4.99 breakfast between 9am-11:00 everyday. Three eggs, bacon, potatoes, beans and tortillas.  Along with chips and salsa."}
{"text":"Not much more to say other than ****BEST MEXICAN FOOD IN TOWN****!   I've tried NUMEROUS other places.  Some were good, some made me ill. The only problem with Las Glorias is that they have ruined me for all the other ones. They are the \"Gold Standard\" for all of the rest."}
{"text":"Never had anything bad here! $2 margaritas everyday- can't beat that, ever. A hidden gem and a must try! Authentic Mexican food"}
{"text":"Food is good but service is slow. There were two servers for 7 people and 3 three tabkes.  Had to continually ask for refills.   This unusual as had good service previously.   The green chili burrito was good with the guacamole made my mouth drool."}
{"text":"Really good! I stopped by to kill some time and get dinner. Ended up with chicken enchiladas which were delicious. Served on a sizzling skillet with plenty of fajita veggies underneath. Guac was homemade and very good. Salsa was very good. Service was good. My only semi-complaint was that the sangria was mediocre- but I still drank two! Will be recommending and will be back!"}
{"text":"I had last minute company for football game today, and before the game started we wanted Menudo. This place is the only place that sold it that I could find, I called and placed my order to go and was told it would be ready in 10 minutes. We made tortillas and got everything else ready at home and I came all the way down to pick it up right before the game, and they told me they were no longer serving Menudo. Even after I said I had already ordered it, and they did not even bother to call me back. I did not have time to go anywhere else, and this ruined my day and my experience with this restaurant. Even if the food is not the best, having exceptional customer service and being honest with your customers is always number one in my eyes!"}
{"text":"WOW!!!  I  thought I'd try a house margarita.. very strong!!  Complimentary chips, salsa and a spicey bean dip.. Then I had the fish tacos: Wonderful lightly seasoned tilapia,  with shredded lettuce, and a light tartar sauce on the side, on a flour tortilla.  Mexican rice, and  a cup of some kind of beans.. almost like a soup.  Hubby had a chocken burrito, and  a horchata.. He was happy.  Vanilla ice cream for dessert.   Now bed.."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this little spot for years now!! Its fantastic!! The secret is Taco Thursday! My family and I often make our way in on Thursdays for there taco special!  Dollar tacos and dollar house margaritas!! I mean how can you beat that?! For this special you get to choose between 3 taco options... Carne asada (my favorite) Beef Taco (only one that comes on a crispy shell) and the Fish taco (Yummmm). The margaritas are small but powerful! if you want something on the healthier side go for the fish taco with no tortilla its still awesome because the fish is always fresh!   The nice cute as a button ladies (all of them are wonderful) greet you with a smile and as soon as you sit down they bring over some chips and salsa but my favorite part is the AMAZING bean dip! ooooooh soooo good I could drink it! The cheese crisps are also to die for they come with green chilies (not spicy) so they give it a little something extra (sooo delish).  Another must try is there Tortilla Soup! Its hearty and full of think chunks of veggies including avocado! Great for someone who's not feeling so great (a touch of nani's cooking does the body good!!)    Cecilia is they most amazing server ever and I'm pretty sure my family would adopt her (basically has) if they could! She is seriously amazing its come to the point where we don't even have to tell her want we want to eat because she knows our order like the back of her hand! Shes always aware of whats going on in the entire restaurant and is always on her A-game!!!  We love our Cici!"}
{"text":"Well I did find a mexican restraunt in Phoenix that wasnt that bland senoran tasteless food.  Las Glorias was some of the best I have had anywhere in the country...too bad I found it when moving out of Phoenix area. Easy 5 stars."}
{"text":"Today was an adventurous day for my family, and myself. We were craving some delicious Mexican food, so I hopped on yelp to check out some of the best Mexican eateries. The reviews for Las Gloria's Grill are what set us in that direction. We pulled up to the parking lot, but there were only 2 cars in the lot. A little skeptical at this point, but it was also muggy out. We walked in and sat/stood waiting almost 10 minutes before even being greeted. We sat down for a good 5 minutes when a regular walks in with a humongous pit bull. Now, I'm a dog lover, so I got a bit happy when I saw him. However, we did not go out for dinner to be eating next to a dog, and his overly intoxicated owner. We politely asked to move tables, and I spoke with the guy to ensure him that his dog was not a threat. We moved tables and one of the women brings over some bean dip. Her finger was covered with beans, and resting over our salsas as she carried them - She didn't look presentable. Next, our drinks came. The most tasteless 'frozen' and 'on the rocks' margaritas we've ever tasted. This is when we decided that we'd rather not taste their food, politely called the waitress over to let her know. No hard feelings, I just know where not to go!   From here, we went to La Santisima Gourmet Taco Shop, but didn't eat there. That's a different story in itself.   We finally found a GREAT SPOT for some Mexican food and margaritas @ Don Ruben's Mexican!!! Great food, great drinks, and damn good service!!!"}
{"text":"We loved the complementary bean dip and chips. The horchata was watered down. My boyfriend ordered the pozole blanco and said it was good but wouldn't order again. He also ordered street tacos (lacking guacamole and would not order again) and half an order of oysters (were brown instead of the usual white). I ordered the combo #9 (enchilada and chile relleno) which was horrible. The tortilla was hard and the chile egg batter was super thick and breaded, it tasted like a sponge. I also ordered menudo which was cold but it was good. The lemons they bought us looked like they'd been in the fridge for a couple days. The customer service is not the best. We waited for about 15 minutes when we were done to ask for the check because our waitress was in the back. Overall I would not come back and I wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Very tasty food! Great customer service. All our party was happy with food. We got our meals to go and didn't have any problems except menu on line has different prices than on menu at restaurant. Also, did not like chicken thigh in chimichanga would have preferred shredded chicken breast. My friend got shrimp enchiladas but it didn't have cream sauce it was more of a tomato based sauce. Another got red chili burro said the meat was juicy but, sauce was okay.  Overall not a bad spot. Would like to try more dishes here."}
{"text":"We went there last week based on the recommendation of one of my wife's colleagues.  Outstanding!!!  She had the soup and salad and I had the Shrimp burro.  The food was excellent, service was very good.  I highly recommend it.  We'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"I've driven by here many times and never noticed this place, but then I had two different people in the same week recommend it!  Got a day off, so we stopped in for a late lunch. It looks smaller from the outside than it is inside. It's clean and the decor is inviting with a Mexican theme of course.  We were welcomed and seated right away. Our server was prompt to bring chips and salsa and to take our drink order. The menu has a good selection. We decided on the Shrimp Salad appetizer for me and the Bacon Wrapped Shrimp for my friend.   The food came out fairly quick and looked great! The Shrimp Salad appetizer looked and tasted delicious! It had cucumbers, tomatoes, red onion, avocado, cilantro and shrimp tossed in lemon juice!  I renamed it Cerviche Salad because it has almost all the same ingredients and had the same flavor! The bacon wrapped shrimp was cooked just right. It came with rice and beans and sauteed veggies.  We also ordered a couple $1 margaritas. They were perfect for lunch and very flavorful!  This place rates excellent for service, prices, atmosphere and food!"}
{"text":"I actually did like Las Glorias on occasion.  Unfortunately, I got burnt on the handle of the fajitas (don't they know its hot before they put it down right under you).  Had a scar on my arm for months. No apology, no ice pack-nothing.  If that wasn't bad enough-they accused me of skipping on the bill that night and then charged me for both times the next time I came in, even though I didn't sign the second charge.  Owner/manager is a real piece of work. Not going back"}
{"text":"This is a solid Mexican food place you need to try.  If you're driving up dont let the exterior fool you, It's nice on the inside and this place was nearly packed at 5pm on a Tuesday.   I called ahead and ordered the chicken fajita burrito and I was there within 10 minutes to pick it up right as it came out of the kitchen.  The burrito came with rice, beans, chips, and salsa. I opted for the Caesar salad for a small amount extra.   The burrito was large and good, served wet with melted cheese with sour cream and guac on the side.  The rice and beans were ok, and the Caesar salad was not worth the extra dollar or so, I'd suggest you pass on that.   The yelp reviews on this place are pretty accurate based on my experience"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The horchata tastes amazing and the two street tacos are delicious, the chips and salsa and bean sauce is delicious too."}
{"text":"I hadn't eaten here in a few years until yesterday as I was in the area.  They were quite busy around 11am on a Sunday Morning.  The star deductions are for the blandness of the food.  The service was good, but the food I ordered just didn't have much flavor.  I would certainly come back and try something different next time, but I certainly found the Sour Cream Chicken Enchiladas not real flavorful, nor were the beans, rice, taco and salsa."}
{"text":"It's like the cliche Mexican grill. Large tables.  Cheesy decor.  Beer promos everywhere.  At least at Las Glorias, the food actually tasted good.    They bring you liquidy salsa and chips to start.  I had a burrito with rice and beans.  This place is a solid 3 stars, but since this is AZ Las Glorias Grill is 3.5 stars.  It really is hard to find decent Mex place there."}
{"text":"Lunch here was really good!!!! Our waitress was really friendly and attentive!  Omg the bean dip that you get along with the salsa that comes with the chips is AMAZING!!!!! So tasty!!!!  I had a shredded beef chimichanga that was accompanied with rice and beans. (The rice was great) All in all definitely worth giving this place a try for some homestyle Mexican food!"}
{"text":"I've had several menu items and most I like. We go 25 minutes out of our way to go here. Food is great!  Menudo is great.  Family run.  It's great mexican food for sure. I go about once every two months.  :-)"}
{"text":"Our first time coming here was about 8 years ago when we lived on 19th Ave & Dunlap; we liked it then & still do now. It's a smaller place located in a strip mall, you could drive by and never notice it. The chips and salsa are always fresh, the beans and rice are good. My boyfriend likes the green chicken enchiladas and I have gotten a variety of things all turned out good. I once ordered the taquitos and they were over cooked but besides that no complaints. They also sell bottled Mexican sodas and frescas that he loves to order instead of a fountain drink."}
{"text":"Very authentic with very good flavor w a bit of spice. I'd come here again when I come down for baseball"}
{"text":"I've been here plenty of times since I moved to Phoenix seven years ago, and I've finally had a dish I wasn't thrilled with-carnitas.  It was more like oven-roasted pork slices, not anything like I'm used to. But....this is the first time in seven years I've been disappointed.  Their arroz con pollo is very good, carne asada, tacos, enchiladas, chimis, you name it-solid dumpy Mexican place!! I've always been treated very well by the staff and never overcharged :)"}
{"text":"some of the best dining experiences happen when you almost don't go inside the restaurant. this is the kind of eatery that makes you thankful for crappy strip malls.  sure, the exterior isn't great. and the neighborhood isn't perfect. but this place is small, friendly, clean. the food is excellent  my friend and i tried las glorias because we were in the area and we had a coupon. we were incredibly happy with ourselves after we found this place.  the chips were crisp and fresh. the bean and salsa dips were delectable. the rice was great. the portions were large. my friend said this place reminds her of her very favorite spot from home. she is something of a chile relleno connoisseur, and she said this one was among the best she had ever had. this batter and lots of cheese.  we will definitely be going back., coupon or not."}
{"text":"Looks like it's update time. Years later and I am still loving Las Glorias. Last time I reviewed, the light rail was still being built. Now you can take the light rail and get off at the 19North - 19th Avenue and Northern stop and you are practically right at Las Glorias! Super light rail friendly.   I typically get my meal 'to go' these days. They even pack up the chips, salsa and that amazing bean dip for my take out orders. My favorite meal is the spinach enchiladas.   As you can see by my check ins, I am still stopping by every couple weeks for a meal here. This might be my favorite local find in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Our favorite Mexican food.  We stumbled across Gloria's by accident and are so glad we did.  Healthy portions, good margaritas food never disappoints.  We make it our go to place when in Glendale."}
{"text":"I had a lovely meal here with my hubby and friend on a week night. Quick and friendly service. The fresh chips, mild salsa and smoky bean dip were a perfect start to our meal. I asked for a spicy homemade hot sauce or salsa to go with my meal and the nice server offered a fresh and SPICY salsa that tasted like a habanero flavor. Both hubby and friend got enchiladas and they were super cheesy and saucy! I ordered Alfredo's Combo? Which was seriously so buttery and well seasoned. It's steak, sautéed shrimp in a jalapeño butter sauce over rice with a side of beans and side of corn or flour tortillas. One of the most laid back, customer oriented, and authentic Mexican joints in Phoenix. Will be returning asap!"}
{"text":"Overall all great food... Low cost but good. Parking is a little hard due to construction but overall great!"}
{"text":"We discovered Las Glorias when we first moved to Phoenix and it quickly became our favorite Mexican restaurant. No frills just amazing food and .99 margaritas rock! I'd highly recommend the arroz con pollo, sooo good!"}
{"text":"They have a great happy hour at this place, and my friend and I had the good fortune to come on the 99-cent fish taco night. We had a few Coronas, and all the fish tacos we wanted at 99 cents each. And the fish tacos were really good: with grilled whitefish, crumbled white cheese, a bit of lettuce and pico de gallo, and lemon slices for squeezing (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/FoKx_RP4kUM-aiGo3wlUUw?select=Nz2ljtMm2hNpttl8WfdS3g). We left the restaurant very happy, and very full; no need for dinner after that."}
{"text":"I don't know why people rave about this place? The chips are thick. The salsa is hot without much flavor. The enchilada has that chewy cheese in it that I always hope no child under 4 eats, because they will choke. Beans didn't have much flavor and were lukewarm. This is my 3rd time here and I won't be back. Plus it was warm and there were a few flies...if you want delicious Mexican food, go somewhere else. If you want just ok food eat here."}
{"text":"I went here with my husband last Sunday afternoon.  We had a 2 for 1 coupon out of the Entertainment guide.  We are from San Diego and have been trying to find Mexican food places similar to the food out in San Diego.  We pulled up to the location and were debating if we should go in or not.  The area wasn't the best, and it was in a tiny strip mall.  Kind of looked like a taco shop.  We decide to go in, because we were starving.  Inside it looked completely different.  It was a little dark and dated.  But the atmosphere was very causal and the hosts were super nice.  We sat down and right away got some nice warm chips, salsa and beans served to us.  I was feeling like a margarita and was going to get the house one, when the waitress said they had 99 cent margaritas available.  We ordered our food and didn't have to wait very long to get it.  Super good food and really cheap 99 cent margaritas. The margaritas were served in pretty nice size glasses but a bit strong.  FYI, I think you're getting really cheap alcohol in there, seemed pretty stiff. I started buzzing after my second glass.   My husband even loved the Chile reino that he tried from my plate.  He usually doesn't like it at all.  The carne asada was seasoned very well, it was a great change from some of the bland Mexican food I've had out here in phoenix. My husband had the beef chimichanga and it was seasoned really well also.  For the price you can't beat it.  From the outside the restaurant seems a little ghetto looking, but once you get inside it's pretty nice in there.  I would defiantly try it again."}
{"text":"There menudo needs some spice to give a kick I won't be order this again, you need to up date your menu all in all it's a nice place to eat I will tell my friend and family till next time oh excuse you charge a little to mush for the menudo large bowl should only be 8.99 and small bowl should be 5.99 the Patas  need to be cook with the menudo ."}
{"text":"Las Glorias is not special. Our two experiences there were just fine. Enchiladas and tacos are good, not great. Chips/salsa are solid but not addictive. If you are going to forego nutrition and eat Mexican, may as well hit one of the many valley special spots like Valle Luna, Arriba, even Macayos."}
{"text":"We came here based on the reviews we read. The food was terrific. The service was great. Very friendly. The $1.50 margaritas a plus. This is a casual atmosphere. Come as you are. Don't let the outside view keep you away from this great food."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Super friendly staff! Great drink prices! Try the sangria and the guacamole for sure."}
{"text":"Las Glorias has awesome dishes at very reasonable prices. I've only been there once, but the meals were outstanding, and my co-workers assure me about all the other meals I've yet to try are just as good as the Green Chili Burro that I ordered. The meat was good, as well as the sauce. The beans and rice were what you would normally except to get. I wish they had black beans as an alternative to refried beans, but then again - I didn't ask for them either.   To me, the chips and salsa weren't the best. I've had much better chips, salsa and bean dip at other places, but these weren't greasy, so that was good. It didn't keep me from eating a bunch of chips, but I think they were going for major gringo-style on the salsa and bean dip.   I can't wait to try the specially-priced fish tacos on Wednesdays, along with a Corona .. after work.   Service seemed par for the course. Nothing stellar, and a bit slow, especially considering it wasn't that busy at the time.   I can see myself coming back here, again and again."}
{"text":"So I used to be a fan of this place. Their rice is incredible. However, today was a very unimpressive experience. I am not picky so when I say the service was terrible, that says something. Food is good, but prices are high in comparision to the level of quality. Today's service was 1 star from start to finish. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Excellent! Great food, good service, nice ambiance, great happy hour! Affordable.  Awesome breakfast special too!"}
{"text":"This is authentic Mexican food in an old style restaraunt.  Excellent food, reasonably priced. The service was also incredible. It is well worth battling the road construction for a wonderful meal. Very authentic and very tasty.  Don't miss this place, wonderful Mexican."}
{"text":"I was craving chips and salsa and Gloria's gave me a fix. One of my favorite things about this place was the service, I never once ha to ask for more salsa and the house marguerites were just $.99. Next time I am craving salsa I'm coming back here. My wife and I split the 13 combo, we got a cheese enchilada, beef tamale, and a chili rellano. All were excellent and the cheese on top made them great. Five stars because I would gladly come back here."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the arroz con pollo here!! My wife and i come here when we want a nice relaxing, great tasting dinner. Drinks are fairly priced. Food is delicious. We will definitely be returning in the near future!"}
{"text":"This was the usual Mexican restaurant. The Margaritas were on sale and the food was the same as Mannys or Macayos. But very good service."}
{"text":"I came here based off the reviews and I wasn't too impressed. It was good/ok mex food, I've had better so I didn't see the rave. I had the ceviche and it wasn't that good. But I'm glad I tried for myself and now I know. Happy Eats!"}
{"text":"Was good. I liked the tacos and they were a great price. I just liked my husband's meal -the chicken enchiladas much better than the tacos. The waitress was very nice and and let us use our coupon from the money mailer even though techinally we didn't order 2 entrees. It is close to home and was a good experience. The only real issue that I had was they only carry pepsi products and I prefer coke."}
{"text":"Great, cheap tacos!  Their Mexican Caesar Salad is also very good and I'm a discerning consumer when it comes to salads.  Very attentive service, awesome flan, and fantastic chips and salsa with bean dip that you automatically start out with.  I might just say that the chicken tacos and the chicken tortilla soup are a bit on the salty side, but everything else i've tried on the menu has been great - especially those fish tacos that everyone raves about!b"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed Las Glorias. Thin crunchy chips with very tasty bean dip and salsa. The portions are generous and the food high quality. The enchilada had the most cheese I've ever had in one. They also have an amazing cheese crisp!"}
{"text":"This place has excellent service and excellent food.  Their freshly made chips/salsa/bean dip is the first awesome platform to begin the meal.  I get stuck on the Green Chili Burro or the Blanco Enchilidas (bomb!).  I have never been let down from any of the many items I've ordered from here....and if you fail to order the flan...your doing it wrong."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican spot in North Phoenix. The carnitas are terrific as are the shrimp dishes. The Carne Asada is good, just short of great. The portions are huge and the prices more than reasonable.   I take my son, so I can't partake in the cheap and plentiful margaritas. But I do get a churro or two off of his kid's meal, which is a ton of food for $5 with dessert.   The staff is friendly and the environment comfortable and generally clean. I say it is the best option for a casual meal in and around the Metro Center."}
{"text":"Quite good Mexican food. Fast service. Good free bean dip along with chips and salsa. Friendly staff. Tiny bathroom."}
{"text":"I live in the area and frequent a lot of the small businesses and stoped here for lunch today and was impressed with the bean dip. The worst part was my waitress took my order wrong and brought me what I didn't order then took it back and \"made\" my meal and brought it to me in 2 min flat...Bland and nasty mess, never again..."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has only 4 stars. ..... It should have 6+... Too many girls working and all are good.... Enjoying my margaritas with a good food!!! I was here maybe 100+ times! Very recommend to try this place."}
{"text":"Best inexpensive Mexican Food in Phoenix.  Yes.  You read that correctly.  It's the place you take people to when they come to Arizona to visit you.  Not fancy pants New Mexico style food (you can got o Sierra Bonita grill, also 5 stars, for $25/pp meals).  This place just delivers Mexican Food like the 70's, only better.  Chips are hot and not greasy.  Two kinds of dip.  Their $7 lunch specials are all uniformly good.  Try the chicken quesadilla lunch special if you are feeling bad, or the $8 shrimp enchiladas in jalapeno butter if you are feeling decadent, or grilled chicken salad with tortilla soup (more like stew here) if you are feeling healthy.  On Wednesdays, you must try the best fish tacos in Arizona.  NOT FRIED.  Grilled tallapia type fish, with a little cream sauce, some shredded cabbage, in a corn tortilla.  I go with coworkers and they order 5 for $1.25 each, and along with the chips, they are stuffed to the gills and only spent $5 plus tip.  Seriously... Wednesdays for Fish Tacos.  Remember.  Even if you aren't usually a fan of fish tacos.  It's tacky decorations.  It's cheap vinyl booths.  And the service is not terrific (secret... if you are in a rush, bring your bill to counter to pay, don't wait at the table).  In a city of good Mexican food, if you are looking for entrees less than $12, there is no better Mexican food in Phoenix."}
{"text":"now the construction is over it will be easier to visit here I love the food and the people . you will not be dis-pointed going here try it"}
{"text":"Can't believe I haven't tried this before, it's so close to the hood. It came up on a yelp search for breakfast, decent reviews, why not. Fantastic, authentic Mexican food... I had Sanoran style enchiladas with over easy eggs...num num Chips and salsa are great an it comes with bean dip! Love that. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Loved this place!  Warm chips, fresh salsa served with bean dip... and that was just the start!  Very good Mexican food in a so-so neighborhood."}
{"text":"Yum Yum Yum!  I went to Las Glorias for lunch today with a large group (there were 11 of us) and I always get nervous when dining with so many people.  It's inevitable that someone's order won't be right or service will be molasses-slow...but not here!  After we all ordered, I don't think more than 15 or 20 minutes went by for all of us to get our piping hot, fresh comida - and not one mistake was made - bonus!!  Everyone's dishes looked fantastic and judging by the fact that by the end of the meal not a piece of rice was left on the plate, I would say this place was a hit for everyone.  Let's get to the food!  While we were waiting for our entrees, we all devoured the tortilla and sweet potato (?) chips which were served with both warm bean salsa and a fresh, pico de gallo-like salsa.  Both salsas were perfect and did their job tiding us over until our meals arrived. I was definitely influenced by the fact that New Times rated Las Glorias' fish tacos the best of 2009 so it was a no-brainer for me (and at least 4 of my other dining companions).  The tacos were honestly perfect.  They were double wrapped in fresh corn tortillas (I hate when all of my taco toppings leak through the tortillas so I definitely appreciated the double dose) with perfectly grilled whitefish, crumbly Mexican cheese and shredded lettuce.  There were huge sides of arroz and beans with cheese on my plate which added to the wonderful flavor and filling portion.   And for only $7 this was a serious bargain.  The arroz con pollo, shrimp burros  and other entrees that were ordered around me received major kudos as well.  For dessert, we ordered the flan, churros and lip-smacking fried ice cream which were the perfect way to end the meal.  Who doesn't love a little dessert-tasting, right?  I will definitely be returning to Las Glorias on a Wednesday when they have their 99 cent fish tacos night (and if I recall correctly beers under $1.50).  Hello mid-week deal!"}
{"text":"Great cozy resteraunt. Had 2 - 1.99 margaritas that were tasty, a little weak but tasty and so worth the price. Also has suiza enchiladas, the square cut pieces of chicken reminded me of cat food but the taste was just right and tomatillo was balanced not too overpowering, rice delicous and soft, beans were good. Waitress not too chatty but pleasant. Great resteraunt, shady area. Hidden gem. Will go back soon!"}
{"text":"Based our visit on everybody else's reviews. So glad we did. This was a wonderful surprise to find. Great food, great service and the place was crowded but that is usually a good sign. I had the beef tamales and beef enchilada combo. I also added a salad. Everything tasted great and my food was served at the perfect temperature. The item I liked the most was the bean dip they serve with their chips and salsa. When we return to Phoenix next year I will be coming back for more."}
{"text":"I went with a friend for the first time in July and I was blown away! We went for lunch and I had a michelada with Sol, I loved the fresh chips with hot bean dip! I had carne asada tampiqeña which is carne asada with a cheese enchilada, it was served with a side of whole pinto beans with cheese and pico de gallo (how I grew up eating them but haven't had in a long time). My friend had chilaquiles with Sunnyside eggs and then churros for dessert. It was about $20 for each, without the tip."}
{"text":"This is my local Mexican restaurant I go to on a regular basis. It's difficult to find right now due to the light rail construction. If you miss the temporary entrance, turn around and go back.  Service is always excellent. Food is always spectacular. Only four stars because I want the kitchen and wait staff to have some room to grow."}
{"text":"Good food and decent prices. I had the camarones al ajo amd my husband had the pescado frito. It reminded us of home, so we will be back."}
{"text":"This is some of the best Mexican food I've ever had and it's the cheapest.  The free bean dip is unbelievable and if you don't get filled up by that all the Enchiladas are great too.  If that isn't already a great reason to come here they have $2 house margaritas that are awesome.  The staff is friendly as well.  The only downside is the location.  I wish the area was nicer, but the food is so good I don't care."}
{"text":"Tacos are must try, delicious. Nachos were really good too. Doesn't look like much from the outside but inside is nice and staff was friendly."}
{"text":"During my mercado shopping day this week my husband was craving Mariscos ala Mexico and our pal Tom knew just the place. This little hole in the wall has all the right signs as you walk in the clientele is made up  of a wide slice of phoenix from  your  people on office lunch breaks , abuelas  with their famillias  and average types like myself.  We ordered seafood inspired Mexican food like shrimp enchiladas  , fish tacos (good but nothing to start a talk thread about )  and sopa de mariscos ..very tasty!   The chips were very fresh and the guacamole and salsas mucho yummo.     word of warning they put a jalepeno butter on just about every entree, for those that dont know oil  spreads the heat in peppers ..so your food is spicy! I will definitely be back again  to try the sopa again ."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious and the service was on point. I left happy and full. Amazing prices for the excellent authentic food."}
{"text":"I was not impressed. Service was bad and the food was medicore but they have cheap drinks."}
{"text":"Our new favorite mexican food place when we're not looking to spend a lot. Love the 99 cent margaritas and the chips and salsa! Ask for the hot which they will only give you upon request, it's definitely homemade and delicious!"}
{"text":"I was hekka hungry today and my friend suggested we go here. We rounded up the apartment troops and hopped in his Hummer around 8pm. There was no wait and we were the last ones to come in just before closing. I was a bit worried since it was a party of 8 and it was so late but we basically ended up with the 2 servers to ourselves after the rest of the customers left.   99 cent margaritas all summer!! WTH and they were not in miniature glasses either!! OMG I saw customers with mi cheladas and other giant margs. Their chips were fresh and hot not greasy or salty. The salsa could have used more bite to it but the kids enjoyed it as well as the bean dip that I couldn't stop eating.   My friends son had the waitress's wrapped around his finger they were very attentive and kept stopping to get kisses from the little guy. The men had the carne asada plates that were ginormous and left nothing behind. I had the enchiladas suiza's and my partner in crime had the fajitas. Mine was good there wasnt really any heat to it but the chicken was cooked perfect. It was all really good I cant wait till I'm hungry again for leftovers. The little ones had pizza's and fries it kept them entertained and their meals included ice cream for dessert. I was really impressed by how nice the staff was way after closing time and they never made us feel like we needed to hurry. They made sure the margs were constantly flowing. The menu had everything but tamales I think. I will be going back to try this hibiscus infused marg it sounded delish!! Party of 8 the bill came to $107 not bad at all!   P.S. If you happen to like Coronas they are $1.25 on Tuesdays."}
{"text":"Outstanding house margarita. Excellent food. We had fish taco, bam, shrimp enchiladas, double bam. Ok a little food reference but seriously worth the stop. Also, great service. The food, margs and service remind me of the days of old. Great job Las Glorias."}
{"text":"Great service. Good Bloody Mary. Ordered the fish tacos. It was just okay. Bland. I will return for other items.  My gf's had the chicken quesdilla and soup and salad. They highly enjoyed their lunch. :)"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican place. Clean, lots of good selection on the menu. Loved the desserts!"}
{"text":"Exceptionally friendly staff and very attentive. The food  speaks for itself. My husband and I have eaten there a couple times and now its our favorite place to go. The food is exceptional and the restaurant is extremely clean."}
{"text":"got a whole fried fish here for $14 and it was fresh! Great service and the margaritas are awesome for $2 its huge !"}
{"text":"We live far now so we do not come to Las Glorias often. We had a great experience today. Yazmin was our server, and she was great. Food was good, and the chips/salsa/beans were good too. Well, too much cumin on the salsa for my taste, but hubby liked it. I had the Caldo 7 Mares, and hubby had the beef fajitas."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for probably 15 years and the food, service and quality have stayed the exact same the entire time! It is a big restaurant with lots of parking in the front and back. They have cheap margaritas, like less than two dollars! The menu is huge and all of the food is just delicious. This is definitely somewhere you should go."}
{"text":"My mother has lived in this area for 20+ years. We have driven by a million times and never stopped. Tonight we decided to try it out. We tried the margaritas. No powder sweet and sour used here. Fresh lime, silver 1800 tequila. They were fantastic. We also tried the red chili and the green chili. Being an Arizona native, I've had a lot of Mexican food in my life! This is one of the best!  Family friendly and great food!"}
{"text":"The best Aguachile I have ever had. Also very kid friendly. My family was introduced to this restaurant years ago by our mom Lupita Valerde as being her favorite Mexican restaurant. Good Margaritas also"}
{"text":"Being from out of town, we turned to Yelp for a nice Mexican place. This was highly rated so we gave it a try. I had the enchiladas and my wife had the fajitas. Both were excellent and the service was great. The enchiladas were served unique from the traditional chili smothering. They instead came like fajitas with onions, red and green peppers. Nice change of pace. We were not disappointed. Very good."}
{"text":"This place is a gem.  Great fresh food.  Not the same old Mexican that is floating around the Valley.  Grilled Chicken Enchiladas are fantastic.  Order a side a of Guac to go with them and they are a perfect twist on your not run of the mill Chicken Enchiladas.  Oh and $.99 Margs."}
{"text":"Been coming here for many years during lunch time. They have the best spinach enchilada with green sauce I've ever had! Made with fresh mushrooms, the sauce is tangy & delicious. Their green chili is outstanding as well. I also love their whole pinto beans, with chopped tomatoes & onions - delicious! Good chips & salsa too, along with tasty bean dip. The staff is friendly and attentive.  I was so glad they survived the light rail construction chaos - it wasn't easy to get there for a long time. Los Gloria's is on my favorite list."}
{"text":"Really good service, solid salsa, chips and ice cold beer.  I would recommend to anyone who is a fan of solidly consistent Mexican food."}
{"text":"This has become our casual go-to place for Mexican food. A homy environment, seems like family. Prices are good, food is excellent."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Las Glorias for a few years now, and it's about time I tell you why :)  Each month I get a BOGO in the mail from them, and when I take my two kids there, everyone loves the complimentary fresh, hot, thin chips, fresh cilantro salsa and tasty bean dip, and their entrees as well.    My daughter, who dislikes Mexican food, orders the cheese pizza and chocolate milk from the kid's menu (yes, they turn a blind eye and gladly serve the kids' menu to those even a tad older than specified age!).  These, too me, are nothing special BUT, to a 13yo girl, pizza is always #1 choice!  My son and I each order one of the $9.99 2-item combos plates, and only eat 1 of the 2 items on each plate, taking the leftover 2 items, beans, rice home w/us. He orders Lemonade, & I can't pass on the (all day/everyday) .99 cent Margarita. And we order a side of sautee'd vegetables, as I make sure my kids at least have a few bites of veggies at dinnertime.  The food is always fast, hot, and looks better, more authentic, home-made.  With coupon, & 20% tip (yes, 20% tip is BEFORE discount), I am out the door for $37.  Beat that!  Now you know why I keep coming back!  The service is always friendly, and there are some very pretty waitresses there, as well...darn the luck :)"}
{"text":"Authentic food for a great a price.  Food is always consistently good."}
{"text":"Awesome chips, salsa, and bean dip. $1.99 margaritas are super yummy. Food is great and the waitresses ate all so sweet."}
{"text":"It has been all too long since I wrote a review. So, here goes. I almost want to give this place 5 stars, but I would like to sample more food prior to doing so. I found this place because of Yelp. I am new to Phoenix and probably going to be gone from Phoenix all too soon so hopefully I can add a fifth star before I go. I walked in and it is a tiny lil dumpy place in a strip mall as most things are in Phoenix. I sit and the chips and salsa are good but the bean dip they serve with it is out of this world. The free part is awesome so what can I expect for the entree. I reviewed the menu but then was offered the lunch menu which is served until 3pm. I decide to order the fish tacos which are made with Red Snapper and a white sauce. Delicious!! not spicy, but mild and very tasty. It is served on one piece of corn tortilla and served with rice and charro beans. $6.99+tax. Can't beat that either. I was loaded and with tip I was out of there for $10 and a happy tummy. I plan to go back again. I must say this was my fiorst pleasant experience with food in Phoenix. I have been hard pressed to find good food here. Being from Austin and a lover of Houston, I have high expectations for my taste buds and this city has left me disappointed .. until Las Glorias. You must Go. UPDATE 5/12/2011: FIVE STARS. I had the Shredded chicken tacos today. Cannot wait to return and try a full menu entree this weekend."}
{"text":"First time here visiting from New York was looking for good Mexican and margaritas of course this place did not disappoint the food was delicious my girlfriend who isn't big on Mexican had the carne asada she loved it this place is worth the trip will be back"}
{"text":"I have been to Las Glorias twice with people from work.  Both times I was underwhelmed.  The first time I went the service was good.  They were great about bringing out chips with salsa and bean dip and refilling drinks.  The second time I came the service was horrible.  We were there for over 1.5 hours because we had to wait for EVERYTHING and it was not very busy.  I was not impressed with the food.  They seem to put raw onions in everything, including the cheese enchiladas.  I really dislike raw onions and am a pro at finding dishes without them, but you cannot escape them here.  The rice and beans were good, but I cannot say much else for a positive about this place.  I will not be back!"}
{"text":"So happy that yelp helps me decided what I'm going to have for dinner at the last minute! This place was a gift that I stumbled upon while doing a simple yelp search by my new place. Without a doubt; I discovered my new fav Mexican restaurant!   Nice and clean inside with classic Mexican decor and plenty of seating.   The service was fast and our server was very smiley. I love a happy server!! Very quick to bring out chips and salsa AND beans! What a treat! Beans with your chips, winner! I split a cheese crisp and shrimp fajitas with my boyfriend. The cheese crisp was a delicious classic and the fajitas were tasty and served on the nice hot plate.   Will definitely be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Mild Mexican. Everything I expected yo be spicy was not. The Carne Asada combo was a good flavor with a top notch enchilada."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I lived a few blocks away from this place for years before trying it with an entertainment book coupon. From the first visit my wife and I were hooked. I've tried numerous items and have loved them all. The bean queso dip and salsa served with the chips are both delicious. In the summer they have 99 cent margaritas. Everything I have tried there tastes freshly prepared and full of flavor. Nothing is too spicy and there is so much variety on the menu. The service staff is always friendly but can be slow on occasion when it's busy. The kids menu is generous and includes churros and ice cream.  This is my favorite Mexican restaurant and I highly recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"This place is small and almost hidden in a run down shopping center - would not have found it if we were not looking for it.  The dining room is small, casual, and intimate.  Waitress was attentive and refilled our drinks without us having to ask.  The chips that come to the table are still warm and taste homemade.  The sauces they are served with are both flavorful - the warm bean dip is the best and the salsa is fresh with just the right amount of spice.  Main courses ordered: pork carnitas, shrimp enchilada with a cheesy cream sauce, and sizzling shrimp fajitas.  Everything came out quickly and very hot.  All of the food was flavorful and everyone was extremely pleased.  We all left way too full!  To top it off, they have 99 cent house margaritas everyday - you cannot get any better than this place!"}
{"text":"I've seen this place all the time but never went because I knew of other Mexican restaurants that I know are good. But my dad has been eyeing it and since he's paying he decided where to go.  First we stood at the front for 5 minutes waited to be seated. 1 waitress was delivering drinks to a nearby table, glanced at us, and kept on going. No greeting, No be right there, completely ignored. So we got to eye the diners food who were seated near by while we waited.  Finally we were seated. Another 10mins role by, passed by several waitress until our drinks we're taken. I told the lady we were ready to order and she said okay...and walked away. Really?!  I ordered an Horchata and a black coffee. I got a very thin milky horchata and coffee with cream on the side. Another waitress came and took our order. We got complimentary chips salsa and refriend beans as we waited. When our meal arrived about 15mins later, I returned my horchata because it was mostly water. After I was half way done with my meal, I finally got the water I asked for when I returned the horchata. Oh, when I returned the drink thats when she decided to tell me that the machine is down and \"their working on it.\" If that was the case I would've ordered something else to begin with.  My meal was 2 talapia tacos, rice and beans with a ceviche tostada on the side. The fish tacos were good, not great but good - same with the beans. The tacos had a tblsp of chopped lettuce and tomato's. I didn't touch the rice. After I finished my meal I asked about my tostada because that never appeared. 5mins later it arrived. The ceviche was piled on top of the tostada, so I had to eat half of the ceviche before I can even pick up the tostada. THAT was delicious.  Dad got a side of beans, a cheese enichilada and over easy egg. First he was disappointed because he didn't get a tortilla with his meal. Each of my taco's came with 2 corn tortillas, so I handed him one of those to keep him happy while we waited for the waitress to happen by. One waitress came and he asked for a sopapilla. She said okay and another waitress came back to us asking about it. They didn't understand that all he wanted was bread to dip into is bean and egg. He even switched to Spanish in the hopes of getting a better understanding of what he wanted. It usually comes with honey and powdered sugar but he had to explain again, all he wanted was the bread. ONE. So 5mins later she came back with 4.   He didn't care for his meal. The refried beans weren't the greatest, the cheese enchilada was made from the can and the egg had too much yolk for his liking. He barely touched it. He did eat some of my rice I didn't want.  All in all, it won't be some place I would be returning. When I crave Mexican seafood, I'll go to Marisco's.  The one good thing, it looks really small from the outside - but it's nice and big inside."}
{"text":"From the beginning to the end the service was amazing. The salsa and bean dip we're very nicely made. I had the $1.99 margaritas and the fish tacos awesome!!! And for dessert churros and ice cream the best."}
{"text":"Great food and plenty of it. I'm not a bean fan, but they have some if the best I've ever had. Talked to a guy who said he's been a patron there every week since he moved nearby. He said the food and service is consistent.  I had the chicken enchiladas (flour) and she had the shrimp. The waitress kept the chips coming even after we were served. Gotta appreciate that. This Is a place I'd return to just to try some if their other fare."}
{"text":"service: 2 stars food: 4 stars  the food was awesome. my friend and i thoroughly enjoyed it. i loved the free chips and salsa. bean dip was also offered, but it was kinda meh to me. i had the enchiladas suizas. she had the chimichanga. my enchiladas were crazy yummy - fantastically tangy tomatillo sauce, tender chicken, soft corn tortillas and a healthy amount of cheese with sour cream on the side. my beans were covered in cheese and the rice was really, really good. she said she really liked her chicken chimi, and it showed - she ate every bite of it.  now, let's get to the service side of this lovely experience. i asked for a margarita recommendation; server couldn't come up with one. i decided to stick with water; my friend ordered diet pepsi. after 3 requests (to two different people) and 20 minutes, the diet pepsi finally arrived. like i said, my friend really liked the chimi, it wasn't what she ordered. she ordered the 2 chimi plate, one chicken, one beef. oh well.   the bill was cheap ... around $24 for the two of us. the food was ready fast and like i said, it was really, really good. i know this is kinda inconsequential, but  i still think it is worth mentioning: i absolutely hate it when restaurants print the calculated 10%, 15% and 20% gratuity amounts on the receipt. tacky, tacky, tacky! and a really bad way to end a tasty meal."}
{"text":"Amazing., Wednesday is the day to go they have super good fish tacos and cheap Coronas that day ., I love this place plus they have been dip with the chips and salsa..."}
{"text":"Monday 99-cent tacos good salsa good Mexican bottled soda tacos al Pastore my favorite"}
{"text":"The food was pretty decent here. I ordered the Steak Fajitas and the portions were huge! I shared it with my friend and we were both stuffed at the end. It came with the sizzling plate of steak, rice, beans, guac (FOR FREE!), and sour cream.   We also ordered a pitcher of the strawberry margarita for our party. Super worth it! It was equivalent to like 7-8 drinks for only $16. It tasted really good and was decently strong. They have a lot of drink specials which makes this place a plus if you want to grab a drink with your meal.   The servers were polite on the most part. The place is really big and can seat 20+ parties. Only reason why I'm taking off a star is because the restaurant could be a little cleaner."}
{"text":"So good better then San Diego Mexican food. Friendly staff and good horchata too. To do son Rico"}
{"text":"I was with my coworker on a business appt in this area today and he suggested we eat lunch here.  I was a little hesitant because the places he has mentioned in the past as being his usual haunts usually don't agree with me but I was actually surprised.    Now, the part of town is a bit sketchy and the interior is nothing fancy but the quality of food and the prices were right in line with what I wanted.  I decided to be safe and get the Taco Salad with Chicken Lunch Special (since I had a bad experience with Los Olivos only a few days ago).  They actually give you large strips of flavorful, tender chicken.  The chips were yummy and they offered 2 salsas. One was a bean style salsa that was mild and the other was a standard medium flavored.  The wait-staff was polite and quick on the refills (I am a big water drinker) so I appreciate the promptness.    I probably won't go out of my way to eat here but if in the neighborhood I will certainly stop by for a quick, tasty, and affordable lunch."}
{"text":"Went there with hubby and mother in law. They bring out chips and salsa and bean dip at the beginning. I'm not a Mexican food expert but we all loved our food. I ordered the shrimp enchilada and after trying the other dishes, thought that mine was the best. SCORE! Our server was friendly and quick. The place isn't fancy looking but the atmosphere is warm and welcoming."}
{"text":"Such a cute little Mexican restaurant! The chips and salsa were wonderful and they served us really fast. The ladies in there were so nice and the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"We live within walking distance of Las Glorias, that said, it wouldn't matter where we were coming from... the food is so good we would make a trip for it.  Thankfully we don't have to.   This locally owned restaurant is amazing, beyond the good food the place is comfortable, like many establishments today, it has multiple TV's normally showing sports events. There are also tables and booths out of the visual noise (sound is very low) on the \"tele's\" so you can have a quiet dinner for two or a family dinner for 6 or 8 just as easy.  Like many who come here we love the chips, salsa, and bean dip they bring to the table when you are seated. The chips are crisp and warm, the salsa mild, and the bean dip is a bit warmer.   *** Here is a tip, they have a hot salsa that they will bring to your table on request.   The chips come with the meal and they will refill them as well no charge... It shouldn't be amazing but other establishments charge for this and less.   Over the last two years we have been here many times so let me tell you that we have more than a few favorites on the menu. One of mine is the Carne Asada Combo ($12.99) and the description on the menu doesn't begin to do it justice. The generous portion of grilled marinated steak is true, but then you get to the beans, not the typical refried beans but a bowl of whole beans in served in a yummy broth topped with cheese crumbles. Then there is the enchilada that is everything you would expect. If you are still reading this and you haven't already started to head over... The real treat with this dish, and it used to be on the menu... you can substitute the enchilada with their chili relleno. The plate comes with a grilled pepper on the side with a dollop of guagamole, some pico de gallo to finish it off.    *** Ready for another tip... With all the construction on 19th Ave they have a special that you may not know about. The MetroMax Reward Card will get you one meal free with the purchase of two drinks and another meal of greater or similar value. The card can be printed from the WWW.ValleyMetro.org site. They have been doing this special for some time and it doesn't show up on the list participating businesses on the web site... So you have to know... Here is the link to get your own card FREE: http://www.valleymetro.org/images/uploads/agency_transitresearch/LRT2013_METRO_MAX_PANEL_CARD_Web_English.pdf   Some of the other amazing meals here are the Two Grilled Steak or Chicken Enchiladas, The Camarones Las Glorias are exceptional Cheese stuffed and bacon wrapped shrimp. The Shrimp or Seafood Cocktail will make you think you are at the ocean in Rocky Pointe. The combination meals are terrific values as well.  If you like Menudo, they serve it all weekend... I am a fan.  The only thing we have tried and not been a big fan of is the combination appetizer tray called the Las Glorias Grill Platter. This is a temping item that is not as good as the rest of the menu, having tried it two or three times it just is weak. Not awful but weak in our opinion. Favorite Appetizers would but the Quesadilla with steak or chicken or the Cheese Crisp. The Shrimp Tostada also makes for a good starter for two if you don't mind sharing.  I can go on and on... They have beer, wine and a full bar... the special is a 99 cent margarita available any time they are open.   If your in the mood for a great meal from south of the border, or just a great meal at a great price this place won't let you down. Breakfast, Lunch or Dinner you will be happy to have been here, and thinking about heading back again."}
{"text":"Fair but not a four star salsa lacks a Mexican flare and the bean dip doesn't have much taste tortilla soup was fair ceasar salad okay dressing little thin"}
{"text":"We live about 1/2 mile from Las Glorias and it's our go to place.  We always get the cheese crisp.  The staff is friendly, we never have to wait but this place is not slow.  Always busy.  The strawberry margarita is delish.  Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I love Las Glorias and eat here regularly. My favorite is the cheese enchiladas combo. The enchilada sauce is perfect, the enchiladas themselves are stuffed full and satisfying, and their refried beans are the perfect amount of spicy. Their green chile is super yummy too.  Chips are always hot, the salsa is good, and service is always friendly. If they're busy they might take a little extra time to get your bill to you, but they always keep the glasses full and the food always comes out promply. One of my biggest pet peeves is when my drinks don't get refilled, and that they always stay on top of that here.   The decor isn't fancy, but it is clean. Don't let the strip mall outside scare you -- it is cozy and yummy inside!"}
{"text":"I dont normally go this low on rating unless there is a problem & omg houston we had a problem. First off we got that we walked in 30 minutes to closing n didn't realize it til after we've ordered our food n i checked in on yelp n seen the time update. So on that note 3 more group of peeps show up b4 closing like 10 minutes prior. My tacos were expensive and they were tiny and the tortillas used was fuken stale ass hell with no flavor at all on the asada or the fish, then i had a shrimp ceviche and hell that shyt was horrible worst I'd ever tasted, then the horchata was just watered down even am/pm had better horchata n they're shyt sux but compared to this place yah..no! Got my son an ice cream wit churros n the chorros were also stale, smh! The absolute worst mexican restaurant i have ever been to, never again will i eat at this place.  Thats just my opinion, and i dont bullshyt when it comes to food, i tell it for what it is..bout the only thing good that came out of this dinner was the server kept coming to my table to check on us which is a plus, so service wise it was good. Quality of food was terrible! Waste of $33 bucks spent."}
{"text":"Fabulous food and service. Was a little leery judging by the exterior but pleasantly surprised upon going inside as soon as we opened the door. Wonderful smell, friendly host waiting to seat us, fast pleasant service and, best of all, delicious food. Our server, Juliana, steered us right!"}
{"text":"I have been to so many mexican food places i have lost count, only the best make the memory bank cut. Let me start by stating that the building is rural, as in rural i mean a bus stop every 100 feet. The entrance is unassuming and old. Inside the walls are decorated with trappings of concerts past and fundraising events long since past. The hostess was very prompt and polite and guided my party and I to a large table center the room, and we had chips and salsa before we knew it. The menu was standard mexican fair with a lafge tequila selection. The waitress was polite and punctual allowing us time in between drinks and dinner selections. My carnitas came hot and delicious, and my cocktail was perfect. I will definitely be returning to this unassuming gem hidden in the valley."}
{"text":"The service is little to be desired.  Asking a waitress to place our order seemed to be putting her out. I do not know how this restaurant stays in business with the horrible service. We will NOT be back.  It is a shame, the food is really good."}
{"text":"So...I LOVE Mexican food and I'm extremely snobbish when it comes to enchiladas. I came here and ordered the Enchiladas Jalisco...and ate the whole thing (very rare for me)! Everything...and I do mean everything...is so good here! You get complimentary chips and salsa and bean dip. Bean dip is dangerously addictive. Salsa is super fresh.  The size is perfect. Two decently sized enchiladas with sides of refried beans and spanish rice. It's not expensive either for the quality you get.  One of the only complaints I have is that I've been here twice and still don't understand how to check out. I always go up to the stand they have near the back of the restaurant. The other complaint is that it's kind of a small place - especially if you sit in a booth. The first time there, my boyfriend cut his knee open trying to get out of the booth (and no, he's not obese!).  OH. And the parking lot absolutely sucks! It's a nightmare. There's not enough room to park anywhere; hard to back out; hard to turn around; it's in rough shape, too."}
{"text":"just tried this place with some friends who are regulars and DAMN, its good. good prices, they bring not just salsa but fantastic beans with your chips (!), my wife informed that the 99 cent margaritas (thats the regular, all day price!) are actually boozy instead of the watered down cheap ones you get at other places. staff was pleasant and attentive...well worth your money and time"}
{"text":"The chips and salsa and bean dip for a beginner are really good . The fajitas are on point tortillas are really good. The shrimp Diablo was spicy and one of the best I've had in town. The rest of the food that I've tried has been really good too many too post all around a great Mexican food restaurant. Highly recommend it"}
{"text":"The servers are extremely friendly!Also the bean dip that is served with the chips and salsa is to die for!Their house margaritas are $1.99 which is a major plus!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my go to places. They serve their chips with salsa and delicious bean dip, and now when we go to any other Mexican restaurant my kids ask where the bean dip is! The food is good,  I usually get a combination plate. It's your typical Americanized Mexican food. My husband usually gets the red chile which he compares to his nana's. He craves it every now and then, and I certainly don't mind joining him. It's good food, and the service is always top notch."}
{"text":"If you are looking for good authentic Mexican food, this is the spot. My family has been coming here for years. It's one of those places my long time separated parents can even agree on!   For starters, the chips and salsa are really very good. This time the bean salsa was a little runny but it is usually really thick and spicy! (TWSS) The other salsa is good too. But the bean dip takes the cake.   This last time I had the menudo. You can tell it is fresh and not made from a can like some places. YUM! and they bring you this lazy susan full of menudo fixins! The large is really very extremely large. I suggest that unless you are a glutton for punishment or a growing boy, order the small. It's just enough. My favourite dish here is the Vallarta fish tacos... So fresh and delish! I usually order a fish taco a la carte no matter what I am eating. It's my favourite thing here. The fish is really light and flaky and fresh. The salads here are really yummy too! My mommy and I sometimes split the chicken and avocado salad and some tacos. Oh and the arroz con pollo and Alfredo's combo (carne and shrimp in this jalepeno sauce), my brother always orders one or the other and I always steal a nibble or two... just fantastic! My pops love the chorizo and eggs from here. It's never greasy or fatty. Really high quality chorizo.   I don't know what it is about Mexican restaurants. They want to clear your plate before you finish you food! LOL Seems like it happens to us a lot here. We always have to say \"oh, I'm not done with that\" lol.   On the positive, I am pretty sure they refill your horchata for free. At least I have never noticed a charge for it."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for a Margarita and good Mexi food within biking/walking distance.   What we love:   Fresh chips and salsa, and the bean dip served with is dee-lish   BIG, CHEAP Margs. Try the Mango, Peach, Mango/Peach. :)   Fish Tacos. I had never had them before and they were very good. On Wednesdays they are only $0.99!   Great enchiladas, cheese crisps, and pork tacos as well   Friendly service. The servers are always impressed (or act that way) when Nico uses his Spanish on them.   It's nothing fancy or will win any interior decor awards, but we love coming here for a fun experience and always get out of there without spending a ton of dough. Muy bien!"}
{"text":"Love love this place!!!! My favorite dish is the arroz cob pollo...however They do need to get a changing table but when i went today they were so helpful at finding somewhere to change my infant. We ended up in the office. The staff is always so nice sweet sweet girls. Please please please get a changing table"}
{"text":"Terrible service and food was horrible. We all got sick. We used to love this place, terrible and will never go back."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in the valley. Not only is the atmosphere cozy and homey but the staff is lovely. This is the go to place to celebrate my mom's birthday every year! If your so inclined their drinks are great. The chicken fajita burrito is my personal favorite. Lovely place for the family and easy on your budget too!"}
{"text":"I have passed this location many times growing up in this city and never thought anything of the place behind Circle K, put once again I can thank Yelp for inspiration after reading a few reviews.  I love that these guys are open at 10 am since that is lunch time for me because I start my morning at 5am.  The salsa was fantastic (always a good sign) and the bean dip was alright but not my favorite.  I love that they have a huge menu of $6 lunch specials.  My waitress told me that the number 7 (2 chicken enchiladas) was the most popular.  I had it with the sour cream and it was absolutely delicious.  The beans and rice were great also, I seen the Wednesday and Thursday specials that everyone was talking about and will have to check those out sometime soon.  The service was good for me but I was the first one there at 10am, I read a few of the negative reviews mentioning that but I enjoyed the experience.  I also thought the atmosphere was really clean and nice, actually was kind of surprised since reviews I read mentioned otherwise.  I don't know what people expect but I was overly impressed with the whole experience.  There was even a flat screen TV and the posters on the wall weren't to much.  I will be back soon."}
{"text":"Ive been coming here for years and they deserve 5 stars because they have tasty and consistent mexican food. The food is a cut above your standard mexican fare. I recomend the any of the lunch specials but I especially like the chicken enchiladas with green tamatillo sauce, comes with rice and beans. 8.50$ Also everyone that works their is very friendly."}
{"text":"Very good food and prices. My husband is hard to please and he topped this restaurant as his #2 favorite."}
{"text":"Great place for authentic Mexican food! They're like family here. (My son's one of their best customers. The food is super!)"}
{"text":"Las Gloria's is a favorite neighborhood spot. Good, home style Mexican food with a very friendly staff and fair prices. We eat there once or twice a month and they always remember us. Their fajitas are a favorite - the Suprema (chicken, beef, shrimp) is big enough for two. Ask for extra tortillas if you're going to share.   They also have some of the best chips and salsa in town, and they are served with an awesome bean dip."}
{"text":"First time here today.  I liked it. We had the enchildas suizas and the chimis. Both were delicious. I also had a strawberry margarita that was great too. The entrance is messed up due to construction but thats okay. I will be back."}
{"text":"Deliciousness - 3.5/5 Happiness - 2/5  There is nothing wrong with the place, it just doesn't stand out. It isn't so high end that it constitutes a hidden gem, and despite having low prices,  I feel you can get better quality of food for a comparable price.   The  complimentary chips with salsa and bean dip were incredible. And the margaritas were a great buy ($4-8 for a huge drink) But all the entrees were simply ok. They lacked any appreciable spice or flavor. The dishes weren't bad, just bland. That said, they absolutely give you massive quantities - it is easily the best kids menu deal I've seen (six slices of cheese enchilada, a generous portion of rice and beans, a drink, and a dessert of ice cream and churros).  But what really gets the low rating is the service. The waiters were friendly, but it took forever. The dinner lasted two hours and that was simply because we were not checked on with any consistency. It took us over half an hour to get anyone to come take our order. And several requests to re-fill water before it happened. The cook time was very long too. I wanted to order a to-go entrée for my wife at home, but ultimately skipped it due to the incredible wait time."}
{"text":"Don't let her looks fool you Las Glorias is awesome! Sure she is located in a run-down strip mall but the food is delicious!  Piping hot chips are served with salsa and a yummy bean dip. Big, cheap margaritas and great specials on combo plates. I got the 2 burrito plate and had one left over for lunch the next day. The carne asada and pork are both excellent.  I have to remember Wednesday's - DOLLAR Tacos!!!!  The servers are friendly and the décor is tacky. This is a great Mexican place."}
{"text":"This place has some really excellent authentic Mexican food.  Ordered the green chile pork burrito.  Everything about it was good especially the salsa.  The guacamole was perfect and the churros for desert was a great way to end the meal. The service was very friendly and fast.  Definitely coming back next time I am in Arizona."}
{"text":"Friendly atmosphere, food is always consistent. Great chips and salsa, bean dip too. We always ask for hot salsa My favorite is the beef fajitas, my wife usually orders shrimp ceviche tostada with a side of mayo. I also like the arroz con pollo. Service is always good."}
{"text":"This is our family's go to Mexican restaurant. Great service, great value, great food and AMPLE PORTIONS!"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place because we had the entertainment book. Glad we did. Great food!"}
{"text":"First time I've been here and it was amazing. The chips and salsa are great, as well as the bean dip. I'm from cincinnati, so it was my first time here and what really won me over was the 1.99 margaritas all day everyday! They are delicious!"}
{"text":"Food was really good service ok got ignored once but the dessert n food was bomb might come back again ."}
{"text":"Pretty good Mexican food.  Great cheap Margs (just like Chi Chi's used to make!) and really great bean dip to go with the chips.  Yum.  Love the Sour Cream Chicken enchilada/Taco Combo.  The fajitas look very good as well.    Service is usually okay but it depends on the night.  The strip mall location is not perfect....but go on in and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Went there because of the 4 star review. The service was average but it seemed if you where a regular you got a lot better service. I had the lunch #12 a burro with chilie filling. This is where my opinion goes way down. The flavor was good but the meat was really tough and full of gristle. I could not eat about a 1/4 of it. I mentioned this to my server and she just nodded and went on about her business. No I sorry or anything. This is why I am writing this poor review. Even if you been in business for a long time you will not get new customers this way. I will go by to my standby places not here again."}
{"text":"Update your hours of operation on Sunday listed in the yelp profile!! It's says open until 10pm and I came down here thinking your business was open when you were not! Very misleading and unprofessional. Not only that but when I told the Girl that was sweeping just so she knew, she was very rude and tried to ignore me. I've came in this place plenty of time and gave them plenty of business and I am a very satisfying tipper. Terrible experience please remove the \"homegirl\" from front of house. You might not get returning customers due to that attitude!"}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Excellent service.  They allow reservations as well.    We had a party of 20 on mothers day and were able to reserve a table before hand.   High stars for fish fajitas, tamales and seafood soup."}
{"text":"Absolutely our family favorite local spot! Food is great and we always receive prompt service. Don't let the outside deter you away, as the the inside is nice and welcoming. Definitely recommend trying this place out!"}
{"text":"Ok, here's the deal: I read the mostly glowing reviews and got a buy one get one free that I can use for lunch. That's a deal! BUT-------------- When I ordered, it seemed like a high ending price with tax for a $7 lunch special. The waitress' answer? I had to pay tax not only for the $7 lunch plate but also the entree I got free! So I paid nearly double the tax (ripoff) especially the tax for something I didn't order. How does that figure? The food-got stomachache later on. The seafood tasted like plastic, like it came from a plastic bag or, worse, been in the freezer for a while. Only the beans had flavor.  Save your money and go to Taco Bell."}
{"text":"I like the bean dip. The salsa was decent.  I had the Chile Colorado burrito, chimichanga style.  Delicious.  I went with friends. It's not really my neighborhood, but if invited, I would return."}
{"text":"Why did I not eat here ever before in my 28 years?    I have always lived around this area and seen Las Glorias Grill in the small strip mall behind the Circle K at 19th and Northern.  My husband and I decided to finally try here tonight when we wanted mexican food.  It was DELICIOUS!  We usually go to places like Garcia's, Manuel's, and Macayo's but I think that will be ending now that we have eaten here.  The chips, salsa, and bean dip were brought out to us very quickly along with our drinks.  The chips were very fresh with just the right amount of salt on them.  The food was brought out pretty quickly thereafter.  I ordered the shrimp enchilada and my husband order a beef chimichanga.  The chimichanga looked like it  was lightly fried - just to the right level of fried.  The shrimp enchilada was probably the largest enchilada I have ever seen.  The shrimp were large and the amount of them in the enchilada was very generous.  The flour tortilla used for the enchilada was very light and tasty.  Both entrees came with rice and beans.  I would say that the rice was right on par with what is made in other restaurants but I believe that the refried beans are better here.    The service was prompt and very attentive (unlike previous experiences at other restaurants).  I would definitely recommend coming here instead of going to any of the more familiar chains out there!"}
{"text":"While we have been here a number of times,  this is my first review.   This place is phenomenal!   This is probably the best Mexican food we have had for a very long time!     The service is always top and always fast.   It is my understanding the restaurant is owned and operated  by Hispanics.  They have a good Hispanic clientele  ...but there are plenty of us Gringos as well.  If you like Mexican food,  this is not to be missed!"}
{"text":"Amazing Mexican food and great servers! Love this place and would recommend it to anyone I know :)"}
{"text":"Just really good Mexican food.  My go to is the ceviche tostada and two rolled tacos.  The Cesar salad w pepita lime dressing is also good.  The menu also includes $1.99 house margaritas and whole grilled fish and ostiones."}
{"text":"First, it is a little difficult to get to, due to the light-rail construction, but once you do, it is worth it!!  We first used to go there, quite awhile ago, when the owner would come out, and wait on us.   We've come back, even after moving out of the neighborhood, a few years ago.  They offer up 99 cent margaritas, all day, every day.  Their chips and salsa are so good.  The chips are thin, and probably baked, which means that I eat twice as many!  *wink*  They bring out a bean dip (warm), and a salsa, both of them are very good.  My husband orders Chicken Enchilada dinner (it comes out *sizzling* hot), and I order Shrimp Ranchero Burro.  The shrimps are yummy, nice and plump, and the dnners are presented very attractively.  We used to download a coupon BOGO (buy one-get one free), and order up a few of those 99 cent margaritas.  They still offer up the coupon, but there is no more 99 cent margaritas included.  So today I had a bottled beer, my husband had an iced tea.  The total was under $19.00 -- not bad!  We try to get to Las Glorias about once a month."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch and to do some homework the other day. The staff was so friendly! The place was not very busy, as it was 2pm on a weekday, so the food came out fast. I got the fish tacos and they were very good! The rice and beans were also yummy. To drink, I got a $3 house margarita- can't beat that! Overall, a very nice experience I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Love, love, love! I have been going to Las Glorias for years and years. Consistently good and I love the staff.   Everything is amazing. Well worth your time."}
{"text":"Easily one of the Best Mexican Restaurant in the Greater Phoenix Area, especially for the money.  SERVICE Always friendly, fast, and very accomodating. There is not host/hostess in this restaurant. So, servers will seat you although you can seat yourself if you don't mind waiting for your server.  I have been there many times and unless they're quite busy i never wait for a refill on beverages or chips and salsa. They are not always the most thoughtful servers, but always very accomodating to your requests.   FOOD Always hot, fresh, and higher quality than most mom & pop mexican hole-in-the-walls. i have yet to find something i didn't like on the menu. However, i do reccommend any item with steak -- their steak is so favorful. Absolutely excellent!  They do offer several kinds of salsas. They usually bring out a bean salsa and your typical mexican tomato salsa. Both are good, although most of my friends and I find the bean salsa to be superior and more unique than most restaurants in this category. Also, they do make a darn good Horchatta as well.  The value of food for your money is superb! Most items do not cost more than $10. The amount of food you receive is above average, not ridiculously large, but on the more generous side. Plus, as i remember i've never been nickel and dimed for extra sides of sour cream, pico de Gallo, etc. except for maybe cheese and guacamole which is understandable (even then, i didn't pay any crazy extra amount).  AMBIANCE For being a hole-in-the-wall in a small shopping center in not the greatest of areas in Phoenix the decor is simple, mexican, and welcoming. Their restaurant is always clean from what i've seen. Bathrooms are nothing special by any means, but pretty well kept."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!! I ate the pork green chili, I am very picky with my green chili. It was so good the pork just melted in my mouth. The rice OMG another food I'm picky with, it's second to my rice and that's saying a lot. Went back on payday to try the pozolé, another home run! This weekend it's time to try the menudo !!"}
{"text":"I live in the area and this is definately my go to mexican restaurant. Im a big fan of their nachos. Not just any nachos, I have them add red and green chili on top. I love their chips and salsa, along with the bean dip of course. Great tasting mexican food and courteous waitresees."}
{"text":"I order take out from here for lunch occasionally and I'm never disappointed: the food is always good. Plus, you get free chips, salsa, and bean dip with every order! They had quick service when I have eaten in the restaurant as well, so this is a great lunch spot during the work week!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing food and the prices are great. Service was excellent! The guacamole is so good and a must to try. The bean dip and the salsa are also great. I was really wanting this type of Mexican food and it hit the spot. I will totally come back to this place. I had the chicken fajita burrito which used chicken breast, my husband got the taco salad in those big yummy salad bowl shells and my little girls got pizza, fries and ice cream and churros (theirs was only $6 each!!!). So good."}
{"text":"Love that this place has $1 margaritas all day everyday.  The food is also really good here, as the enchiladas are amazing.  The bean dip is really good and it's cool that they give it to you for free.  The place is located in kinda of a dump, however the restaurant is actually nice."}
{"text":"Appearances can be deceiving! Looks like a store front in a run down plaza, but don't let that keep you from entering. The atmosphere was quaint. From the chips and salsa to the fried ice cream = Fantastic. The server was noticeably busy, but another server stepped in to help out. Both were friendly, and we wanted for nothing. I'm glad we found this place. I really wanted Mexican food, and this place delivered. If I'm ever in Phoenix again I will be sure to visit."}
{"text":"Delicious Arroz con shrimp,  ceviche tostada, chicken enchiladas!!! Great service.  Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I really can't believe I haven't written a review yet for my favorite neighborhood place, Las Glorias. I love this little gem so much: wonderful, homemade food and the warmest and friendliest staff.  My favorites? The bean dip that comes with the salsa is fantastic ... not too spicy but creamy and flavorful. Whenever I feel a cold coming on, I order a large bowl of their chicken tortilla soup. It's so substantial with a good mix of chicken chunks, fresh vegetables, avocado and a savory broth. Does it cure my cold? Nope, but it really does make me feel better! Their fish tacos are my favorite in the Valley and come with whole beans that I could eat an entire potful of. If it's Friday night and my SO and I don't feel like waiting 40 minutes for one of the trendy CenPho dinner spots, we hang out at Las Glorias and get one of their tasty margaritas and their chicken avocado salad with cilantro dressing and pepitas. The man loves that they always have a sports game on TV. I love the super comfy booths and welcoming decor. They also serve a delicious garlic fish (and a few other great seafood dishes) so you don't have to sacrifice healthy eating for a night out. Don't be put off by the strip mall. They'll get to updating it eventually but for now, it houses this lovely little place so I'll take it."}
{"text":"So very happy finding a Mexican Restaurant that had perfect Margaritas as well as fantastic food, fantastic waitresses. I will definitely be returning to eat here again. I will also be returning with visiting Guest from out of Town."}
{"text":"Very good! I'm always in pursuit of a great menudo. This one is very very good and comes with all the fixings. My wife loves the chicken chimichanga. Rice and beans are authentic and Victoria (our sever) was outstanding! We will be back......"}
{"text":"Las Glorias is still the best Mexican meal I've had in Phoenix. The construction is a distant memory and there's a gleaming new light rail stop, right across the street (that seemingly no one uses, hah). But maybe they should, because the complementary chips with salsa and beans intro is always popular. Their tortilla soup is banging. Spinach enchiladas, still amazing. Our party enjoyed an open faced cheese crisp, made from a tortilla as big as the sky above. PRO TIP: put salsa on the cheese crisp. It's certainly not the fanciest place, at the end of the meal, the way to pay is at a register. And the menu can be too big. But if you order carefully, it's legit."}
{"text":"Ok so I was blown away w all their food tonight. Came here for a work retirement party and I heard this place is really good for authentic Mexican food but I didn't think it was this good.  I got the sangria and my husband got a beerarita. Both very good!   First of all the chips salsa n bean dip they give you is amazing!! I finished the entire basket of chips w the bean dip!! N I hardly ever eat or enjoy beans.   As my main I got the arroz con camarones (shrimp instead of chicken) and my husband got the fajitas supremas which came with shrimp, steak and chicken w side of rice and flour tortillas. I even got one carne asada taco to try cuz I love my tacos!! Ok this is where I gave them 5 stars! Everything was delicious!! N the price point!! Can't complain!!  I will definitely b back to try other items!! And this is my new favorite Mexican restaurant!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the huevos rancheros. It was good and tasty. They serve chips salsa w/ Beans while you wait. They also had piña water with free refills(who does that). Staff was attentive and overall the atmosphere was great for the breakfast I enjoyed."}
{"text":"Like the reviews say, you would probably never find it on your own and it won't stand out when you do, but the food was ok. The service was great. The girls were very helpful and friendly. I think only one behind the register spoke English well though. It was very basic. Nothing unusual or different but for what it is, pretty good. Seating restaurant style inside. My friend says it the best Mexican food anywhere. I can't tell the difference between here and Filiberto's, but hey. I'm just a dumb half Mexican white girl so what do I know."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here on our fourth date- after really talking it up.   The food is good- not gourmet Mexican, but typical Mexican. It's good. My boyfriend loves the free bean dip. So much so that I bought some for his Mexican themed 30th birthday party.  Cheap drinks, although I am sure the ingredients are not quality.  Super nice wait staff. Don't let the location fool you, definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"I really love this place the owner is outstanding , but...on a recent order and this is the second time now that my friends brought me back my favorite salad and i was not happy , they do tend to stinge on the chicken , for a big salad the chicken was barely there , just some dried out corners that probably was half of a breast chopped in tiny pieces , I will go back to eat there no doubt but I do have to address the issue because I do not have the time to run back during my lunch time , please make sure your order to go looks decent , thanks"}
{"text":"4.5 stars indeed!   Had the Spinach enchilada and Chicken/avocado salad! It was super flavorful and delicious.   They catered to a diet request which is important!  However, It wasn't packed due to the time we ate but service wasn't quite as fast as expected!"}
{"text":"Exactly what you call HIDDEN GEM! Food is literally amazing- they give you amazing salsa, bean dip and chips. Get the guacamole- it was fresh, a good serving, and had a kick. 3$ margaritas! Really need to check it out for amaZing Mexican food and drinks! It was so good we forgot to take pics!"}
{"text":"Gloria's is where we go every Thursday for $1.50 tacos and 99 cent margaritas.   It is just down the street; in our neighborhood and where we always go.  We love the place.  The service is good and they are very professional and courteous - not to mention lovely.  To be honest I used to go there in the 70's when it was El Tango (and not as good!).  Now they are on the trail of the light rail and we hope the parking doesn't make things difficult for them but allows them to become one of those institutions along 19th Avenue."}
{"text":"The menudo here is goooood. They have great seviche and drinks. Everything on their menu is great. It's a hole in the wall but very clean.  You will feel welcomed here."}
{"text":"I had the shrimp enchiladas, and they were awesome. My friend had a burrito and a cheese quesadilla and lived them. Very authentic."}
