{"text":"Went to this place to make sure it was as good as man vs. Food made it seem! Was not disappointed it was delicious, I orders a Milanesa nothing but perfection!! The only reason why I give it a 4 is because of the crazy loud music they have playing, god I can't even Hear my self thinking I had to scream for them to get my order and for a person who talks loud like me to scream it must have have super  loud that they could not hear me!"}
{"text":"Excellent place! I highly recommend it to anyone that is looking for authentic and affordable Mexican food. I drive from Tempe and it worth the drive... I have taken my relatives and they all raved on how awesome the food is. I'm seriously surprised I have not heard about this place sooner :-)"}
{"text":"Tried this place after reading the reviews on Yelp. I had tacos, chicken, asada and pastor. I was very underwhelmed and disappointed."}
{"text":"A hole-in-the-wall...this is the place I go to to get my \"mexican\" fix.  They know how to make carne asada burritos.  Nothing in it but the meat, rice, and beans.  I really do not like how the other joints throw in lettuce and tomatos.  Keep it simple.    And their horchata....YUMMY!!!"}
{"text":"I've been eating tortas my whole life! These people make them the way they are supposed to be made...huge and stuffed. You get a lot for your money, plus grilled jalapenos. If I wanted to go on a suicide mission I'd stop here and eat non stop till my blood insulin level  go through the roof. Please enjoy."}
{"text":"Great place to get tortas in the city favorite spot since 2010 its favorite torta is the milanesa and the asada the horhata id the bees knees i highly recommend this spot"}
{"text":"This place is hands down my favorite place to stop at for Mexican food. Everything from the Tostadas de Ceviche to their tacos is full of flavor. You can honestly not go wrong with anything on their menu. Their staff is constantly on the move making sure everything is okay and to your liking. I recommend this place to all my coworkers and friends. If you're near, stop by and enjoy some authentic Mexican food!"}
{"text":"I stopped at this place thinking that it was featured on Man Vs. Food. I got over the initial disappointment, and ordered the torta Arizona.  This sandwich contained almost everything but the kitchen sink (order the El Rey, if you dare).  The bread is always fresh and the food is cooked to order. The wait staff is friendly and attentive. I've taken several groups of co-workers, and all have pledged to go back."}
{"text":"I hate strip mall restaurants.  But - I forgive this little place.  Nothing fancy. Very simple.  Very ethnic. So much that the menu is completely in Spanish.  But don't let that scare you ... there are pictures on the menu! Lots of pictures!  I guess they are mainly known for their Tortas (which are sandwiches).  And their tortas are HUGE! And, yummy.  Some combinations are a bit unusual.  I recommend, unless you are REALLY hungry - start with the little sandwich (I like to call them \"tortita\" - don't quote me - that's my expression and the waiter will NOT understand you).  But my husband and I always get tacos.  He orders Tacos de Alhambra de Res - strip steak with chopped ham and bacon (I think).  I order a cheese quesadilla de maiz (Maiz instead of flour - much better!).  The quesadilla is served with a  green chile salsa sauce inside - spicy - but not to make your eyes water.  You can get quesadillas stuffed with other fillings too.  They have different flavor Horchata's as well  (I love to say Orrrrrrr -CHA-ta).  I'll tell you what....my mom is from Mexico City.  She says that the tacos are like what you can buy on the streets in Mexico (which is a good thing).  I think you should take a chance and trust my mom on this.  She owned a Mexican restaurantt in Upstate NY before Mexican food was \"in.\"    If you read this and do give it a go - let me know what you think!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Lots of flavor, cooked with care. The taco plates are huge and priced really well (like $6 or something close). Great service.  The signature tort a will put you to sleep, but it is really good too.  I think this place has way more flavor than the other torta shops I have tried."}
{"text":"Deliciosos Torta Mexicana. The carne asada was  perfectly cooked. Also, the bomba avena is really good. Everything came out hot, and fresh. Servers were friendly. Like their homemade salsa. Many of the tortas come with a grilled chile. Really nice, crisp bolillos.  This place really reminds me of the tortas you can get in mercados in Michoacan, Guanajuato, el DF.  Next time I am PHX, I will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since 2009 and let me tell you, this food is truly authentic and delicious. Last time I ate here I heard someone complain that this wasn't real Mexican food, I was born in Mexico and I know this is real Mexican food hands down. People think that Taco Bell food is authentic and expect every Mexican food restaurant to be like that, uhh NO! The quesadillas are to die for, I always get the flour tortilla quesadilla just because they add guacamole inside whereas the corn one doesn't have any. The staff is very friendly and they recently obtained a liquor license... Looks like I'll be there even more now :)!"}
{"text":"Always so good. Authentic food. Owner is here daily and often will come to check on you. Some may not like the location but trust me the food more then makes up for it."}
{"text":"Al pastor fries, two carne asada tacos, one large horchata. About $12.50. Came here because the lines at a competing taco place were ridiculous. The guys working were really nice and the horchata was super yummy. Food was served up quickly. The boyfriend said the asada was a little dry and while my fries were good (meat, nacho cheese, queso fresco, sour cream) I wouldn't have minded guac and a little more meat. I would come back because of the low price and/our if my original restaurant choice didn't pan out."}
{"text":"Food was good service sucks. Prices on the menu are wrong n they dont care. Girl was like ohh we printed too many so we havent change them"}
{"text":"Very good Tortas, had the Milanesa sandwich. Breaded steak sandwich with avocado, jalapeño."}
{"text":"We were in the area for an appointment which we were early for so since I've heard this place has good food we decided to try it out. Food is really good, service could improve a little though."}
{"text":"Best tortas in the area, period.  Miles better (and cheaper) than the much-fanfared El Guero, which is super overrated anyhow.  Tasty, chewy rolls, freshly grilled ingredients.  For filings, there's a pretty extensive selection - somewhere around 15, if memory serves - from simple staples to stacked monstrosities of delicious goodness.   My favorite is the Ranchera Especial - carne asada with a simple chipotle sauce.  The bigger guys are pretty good, too, and are no joke.  I come here at least 2-3 times a month for work lunches, and nobody has ever been disappointed.  Never ordered anything non-torta related, but they do have a full menu, including huaraches and various other non-standard but good Mexican items.  Atmosphere-wise, the place is nice.  Clean, bring colors, friendly-but-not-overbearing staff.  There's usually a soccer game or Spanish-language day-time talk shows on whenever I'm in."}
{"text":"Horrible... Ordered carne asada tacos got mini tortillas filled with some sort of meat and nothing else. No sauce, no veggies, nothing. Make your own decision, but I would stay away."}
{"text":"The place is open 24/7, is pretty quick with orders, is priced very competitively. I have yet to find a better place for tortas!"}
{"text":"only down fall is cash only good Mexican tortas I ordered the carne asada it had carne asada, avocado, beans ,lettuce,tomato, mayo and hot sauce... they take a while to serve your food but it's pretty good"}
{"text":"Fantastic food! Grey mexican food prepared differently than most big box Mexican chain restaurants."}
{"text":"Los meseros les gusta tips. So aqui tengo un tip. Yo ordene mi comida para comer ahi y hasta le dije a la cajera \"esto va hacer para aqui\" me dice \"okay\" me siento y llega la misma mesera y dice \"sorry te lo hicieron para llevar\" me dio la comida y se fue. Yo trabajo para dos restaurantes y cada ves que nos pasa esto a nosotros decimos \"perdon, le voy a decir a un chef que ponga esto en un plato\". Eso es mi tip para ustedes. Por eso no regresaré, por algo chico que muy fácilmente podían arreglar pero no les vale, ni me preguntan \"todo bien?\" \"Lo quieres para aqui?\" \"Te lo arreglamos?\" \"Como esta la comida y su servicio?\" ahora solo ire a TORTAS PAQUIME para comprar mis tortas..."}
{"text":"The tortas here were HUGE, so much that I had to leave like a third of it for my friend who lives in Phoenix since I had a plane to catch back to San Francisco.  The meat inside was well cooked, well seasoned, and definitely backed up why this place is called the King of Tortas."}
{"text":"Carne Asada fries and the al pastor torta are solid here- service is drive-up or walk-up, and they don't habla ingles or accept credit, so be prepared with your best espanol and cash dinero.  The asada fries are a little bit of fries, a bigger bit of asada, and an insane amount of sour cream and cheese. I was good after a few bites, but it really needed hot sauce thrown on top to cut through the grease- even after doing so, we were unable and unwilling to finish the portion, which is probably a blessing in disguise.  The torta was large, they're all a flat $5 with your choice of meat, and they are mostly meat instead of filler ingredients- very cheap and fast lunch if you're already in the area."}
{"text":"This is the best place to eat.  It maybe a hole in the wall, but amazing, amazing, amazing can't even begin to describe it!!   The food is the best of course and the people are super nice! Don't miss it if your in the PHX area!"}
{"text":"Very good tortas. Ordered the asada torta and came on a soft bun with avocado and tomato. Had lettuce and grilled onions on the side with lime wedges. Would definitely come back to try other menu items."}
{"text":"After reading some of the reviews on Yelp I was so excited to try this place.  I'm a big fan of Los Reyes De La Torta in Sunnyslope and was so happy to know there was a place just as good within driving range for lunch.  The name is no longer Tortas La Presa but it is now named Torta el Rey.  Lets put it this way, there is only ONE KING and this place isnt it.  The building isnt nearly as clean or well set up as Los Reyes.  Also the food is lacking majorily.  I tried the Ranchero torta con papas.  The portion was a decent size however the taste was lacking in a major way.  Seems to me like this place is trying to feed off of its cousin shops success but it isn't in the same league.  If you want the king you have to go to Sunnyslope."}
{"text":"On a visit last week to Scottsdale, used Yelp for best Mexican, and went here.  Small strip mall, 75% Hispanic customers, and the sit down area was clean and comfortable....reason I mention the % is that this is not a tourist location, only the best Mexican that I have had...regardless of price...went with the Hawaiian quesadilla...amazing....wife went with the chicken torta....also fantastic....wish they had one on Illinois....no beer served....but our of there for $25....    Pj"}
{"text":"I love getting burritos from Tortas El Rey!! I always customize my burritos and they always get my order right at this location. The burritos are very large so you won't be dissatisfied when it comes to size. I have come to this location multiple times and love it every time. The building looks a little run-down, but the food is great and the service is great! I never have to wait a long time before I get my food and they have a covered outdoor area with tables to eat at that's located next to the building. They also have a drive-thru if you're in a hurry. I would definitely recommend eating here if you are craving Mexican food!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite taco joints in town, comparable to the popular \"Roberto's Taco Shop\" but keeps that Mexican authenticity (some argue some taco shops have been tainted by \"Americanized\" taste).   This location only has a drive thru and order window so don't expect to walk into a cooled building and have comfortable seating. They do offer tables outside, but who wants to eat in this Vegas heat? Don't let this tough exterior fool you, this place is top notch high quality food!   Most of my visit have been thru the drive thru and is sometimes a hit and miss when it comes to wait time/line. Majority of the time I'm \"in and out\" in less than 5 minutes but in some occasions there are a several cars ahead and waiting time can take 20+ minutes but I endure this \"long\" wait knowing my taste buds will be rewarded with some awesome food!  Favorite of mines is the carne asada burrito with everything. \"Everything\" includes Mexican rice, beans, onions, light hot sauce, cilantro (I think) at a very generous price of $5.86??? Burrito is wrapped very tight so you will hardly get that dreaded spill of stuffings.  I also get their carne asada tacos that are price at a dollar and some change, these palm sized tacos are delicious and very filling given their size. I remember getting 10+ tacos at one point and had a very happy stomach at the end. I believe they specialize in Tortas by the name of the shop but I've only gotten it once and I was not disappointed. Each order comes with lemon, hotsauce, peppers/carrots/onions so you don't even have to ask for these extra things it's provided for you!   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Nasty I'm sorry for all the 5 stars obiesly you don't know tacos el gordo hands down.  This place is nasty my husband convinced me to come here they microwaved my food tortillas were hard and cold.we said no avocado because of allergies and they still did .people don't listen to instructions never coming here again FOR AUTHENTIC MEXICAN GO TO TACOS EL GORDO"}

{"text":"Like many eateries in the area, Tortas el Rey is found in a nondescript and definitely not-upscale commercial area. But the volume of the business witnessed by our lunch group (Rand H., Mike C., Robyn N., Arlin B., and me) is a testament to its popularity. With very good quality food and great prices, no wonder it is so popular. Make sure you're hungry when you come here because you get a lot of food, whether you order the tortas or the platters. And even if you're not hungry the wonderful aromas and great flavors will probably stimulate your appetite enough to make you finish what you are served. Los Reyes de la Torta, this similarly-named restaurant gives you some serious competition."}
{"text":"I drive by this place pretty regularly, so I decided to stop one day. Soon I took my wife there for lunch, and then she took folks there. I go back periodically. I really like the food here. The tortas are great - and huge. I see people eat the \"Rey\" and I don't know how they put it away (and I'm a pretty big eater). I've really fallen in love with the quesadilla de maize - a large, corn tortilla based quesadilla. I love their grilled onions and vegetables.   The prices are low. It's pretty easy to get lunch for $5-6, and I only eat half, so get a second meal out of it.   One of the best parts for me, is that the staff generally seems to like being there. One day I was watching an middle aged cook, and it genuinely looked like he enjoyed making the food. The place has the feel of a number of restaurants I've been to in Mexico. Generally clean, but not real high by US standards. The area is ok (a little on the lower economic scale) and there's plenty of parking."}
{"text":"It's very small and it can be scary if your not familiar with the area BUT YOU' ll be fine service is great, food is a bit greasy but duh almost all Mexican food is. If you want a nice quick lunch this is your spot, if your expecting the most biggest or yummiest burrito in Vegas this isn't your place....now don't get me wrong their burritos are good but lacking compared to Cali but its Vegas sad to say Mexican (American) food sux here anyways. To get to the point don't expect a fat burrito, good quick food... And try the carne asada fries their very good unlike Roberto's yuuuuuuck, tortas are delicious!!"}
{"text":"One word... WOW!!! The Torta El Rey is a must and the Camarones al la Aeracruz were to die for! It was clean, fresh and friendly and very authentic.  The portions are ridiculously huge and affordable. We went on a Sunday so they were out of a couple things but, nothing to fuss over the menu is HUGE  just like the flavors there!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out for the first time and when my coworker came back with the food she had pizza boxes. The quesadilla al pastor I ordered actually came in one of those pizza boxes it was that big ! And at a reasonable price too. The food tasted great and I will be back to try some of their other menu items."}
{"text":"I'll be the first to say I'm a bit picky when it comes to Mexican food and up until now, I haven't been able to find any that has caught my attention. Tortas El Rey changed that for me. It's delicious and insanely affordable."}
{"text":"I work in the arcadia area from time to time and do not have much time for lunch... This place has the very best street tacos carne asada. Only one server in the joint and she busts her hump(literally she is pregnant) working in there... the tacos are to die for.. always crunchy meat and perfect onions & cilantro... the price is unbeatable and food is prepared very fast so you are not late getting back to work... I wish there was a Tortas El Rey in Mesa!!!    yumm!"}
{"text":"Sooooooooooo amazing!! Their tortas are really good & they have a really good variety. Some of them are a little overwhelming because there is a lot going on. Their tacos are really good too"}
{"text":"While I've tried various Mexican restaurants around the valley and in parts of California, there seems to be a distinct flavor with these smaller locations that just makes the food extremely flavorful.  I'm not sure if it's the years and years and years and years of grease and food residue or just a good cook but whatever it is it makes the food perfect at 2 in the morning when your heading back home from a night out with friends.  I normally order their Carne Asada Burrito which is always a crowd pleaser but their other options are also good. I've also had their Torta de Milanesa(breaded chicken) and their tacos which always seem to hit the spot.  The location isn't great and the place looks run down oh and you get the occasional homeless person asking for a taco but if you just use the drive thru then you'll be fine.  Overall, good flavor and great salsa! (Almost forgot, they only take cash no debit)"}
{"text":"My husband is not a big fan of mexican food but after giving this place a chance we are definitely going back every time we visit Phoenix. Tortas are amazing and the quesadillas are to die for!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing! Everytime I come 2 PHX I come 2 this plc. It's small, not fancy, but who cares b/c UR here 4 the food! The food is extremely fresh. Did I mention homemade? The waitress is so sweet & helpful. Only drawback is their not in Los Angeles! Can't wait 4 my next trip 2 PHX! (I wanted to add pictures that we took, but can't figure out how)"}
{"text":"This place is really yummy has the torta el rey it's really big. .also had the strawberry Agua fresca that was pretty good too..fast and friendly service. .the only thing was they don't have French fries which I was craving  lol but not their fault haha.btw to me this place is better than Reyes de la TORTA and tortas paquime"}
{"text":"Been there 2X already and always good.  Had the 3 chick tacos and 3 Asada tacos.  Both were delish.  Service is fast and food is plentiful.  This is a neighborhood joint short on atmosphere but oh so good is the food.  We'll keep going!"}
{"text":"Ordinary food with extra-awful service. I came here in my way to PHX. Food was fine nothing to write home about (probably a solid 2.5).   What I didn't like was that they declined my corp card. Amex Corp cards have no limit which I tried telling the girl multiple times. I had to catch a flight so I just gave her a personal card. Then they figured out the issue was on their end and still charged my personal card. I know, I know first world problems but I'm going for the full disclosure here."}
{"text":"They are open all night which is great because I work night shift the tacos are small but full of flavor and try are cheap this place is 10xs better then Roberto's"}
{"text":"I ordered a hurache de alambre . certainly did not meet my expectations. The size is huge , but it felt more I was eating a big taco rather than a hurache. The corn tortilla is handmade. Definitely huraches are not their specialty. The costumer service is decent, but the place itself is not very clean. I do like the fact that you can see the cook prepare your food. I will be going back if I get very hungry and I'm around the area but I will not order anything with alambre, and most definetly not a hurache"}
{"text":"Good decor,'fast and friendly service, amazing bathrooms...el Rey sandwich lacked flavor but amazing idea...I would go here again to try something else,"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, and the first time I loved it. I'm from San Diego and we have pretty high standards for good Mexican food since we're surrounded by it. The carne asada was delicious. The second time, I waited over 30 minutes for my burrito to be done, and people who ordered after me got their orders first. I was irritated, but it was the lunch rush so I was trying to be understanding. Then my burrito contained every nasty piece of meat. Fat, gristle, weird crunchy pieces, it goes on. Disgusting.  Overall I'd give their food a 4, but between the service and terrible quality of my most recent order it plummets to a 1."}
{"text":"I looooveee this place! The tortas are the bomb.com!!!  BUT...I usually order the quesadilla de maiz...no meat just enjoy the homemade masa and mexican cheese :D  The salsas are sooo good! I mean authentic...tastes like they've got an abuelita back there roasting the chiles and what not! lol  My boo gets the huarache....again, no meat. keeping things simple is sometimes better than all that fancy shmancy ingredients."}
{"text":"This is the BEST of the Best Mexican Food, been here several times and had all dishes in the menu, this is the Original flavor of Mexican Food. Mi amigo Benito no doubt is El Rey de la Tortas"}
{"text":"How did I not know what a torta was? For some reason I had this memory of a torta being served on brick hard pita type bread...Was it nightmares of Taco Bell? I'm really not sure... I was quite hesitant when my friend suggested Tortas La Presa. \"I don't like tortas\" I thought... Well I was very, very wrong. The staff speaks mainly spanish and they were so helpful when addressing my gringaness. Lucky for me there were also a lot of pictures on the menu.  These tortas here are served on a soft, fresh bolillo bun. I can't remember the name of the one I had but it was something Reyes.. It had carne and queso fresco with avocado, lettuce and tomatoes.. My friend had one with mozzarella cheese, both were absolutely delicious. I watched soccer on the big TV and washed my down with a perfectly sweetened horchata. I can't wait to go back and try every one on the menu..This place rocks."}
{"text":"I will give this place 4 stars because the torta especial that I ordered was decent. To be honest, I'm not a huge torta fan, but went here because of the good reviews and I was driving by. The price was a bit much for the area but the plate was pretty big. Went with a friend who really enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"This one of those places that if eat it once u start craving it at least twice a month, i walked here today with my family from my hse wgich is about 20 blocks away. And it was woth every bite...i recommend the sope its basically a giant taco with of course ur choice of meat. But ive been coming here for more then 2 years and all there food is the bomb no other way to describe it...."}
{"text":"I was flying up 24th street late for a business meeting when I cut the wheel into the nearest strip mall shopping center to grab some lunch.  Opened the door at Tortas el Rey into one of the best Mexican meals I've ever had.  Lemonade with fresh squeezed lemons. Home styled salsa with the right amount of good heat.  Fast service, and large portions of fresh onions, peppers, chorizo, quacamole, and homemade tortillas served steaming. I had the house signature dish Alhambra de Res.  Que bueno!"}
{"text":"I've had their food here before many years ago but forgot what it tasted like!  Decided it was time for a refresher!  Started off with the Carne Asada Fries...eat your heart out Robertos! This was damn good actually...lots of melted cheese and plenty of Cotija on top...delicious!  One of the best versions I've had of this dish.  Also had the Al Pastor Torta. Very good! Lots of flavor in the al pastor, and it was tender considering it's not rotisserie style. Portion was also large considering the cheap entry price!   The Chorizo con Huevo Torta would be a good choice if you are craving breakfast food. Good flavor in the chorizo and the egg.  Give em a shot if you are in the area :)  Pics:"}
{"text":"I've tried a lot of Mexican food from different places since I moved to Arizona and the food has been good but this place was really good! There's something different about Tortas el Rey's food that makes it extra yummy and authentic. I had the shrimp burrito and it was so delicious. Their rice was also spicy and flavorful. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"After our waiter brought out a torta, I wondered why I didn't get one myslelf, although the beef sope was itself a meal to behold.  Enough for 2 people, the beef was plenty tender and it was seasoned quite well.  My friend got a cheese quesadilla, which was also good, they bring you veggies to eat with your meal, instead of just some rice.  When in the neighborhood and looking for a tastey cheap meal (no alcohol, though) Tortas La Presa does the trick."}
{"text":"We had excellent tortas in San Diego. We saw this place while we were in this neighborhood and we were hungry. They have \"tortas\" in their name so they would have good tortas, right?  I wanted to try the Milaneza (breaded beef steak) torta but it wasn't available so I got the chorizo con huevo torta.  We also tried carne asada fries and al pastor torta.  Chorizo con Huevo Torta and Al Pastor Torta:: Comes with avocado, tomatoes and lettuce. Not enough meat and the bread was alright.  The chorizo torta had tiny pieces of chorizo and a fried egg. Quite spicy. The Al Pastor was tasty. 3.5/5  Carne Asada Fries: The fries themselves were great. Crunchy and hot. Topped with sour cream, CHEEZ WIZ, carne asada and cotija cheese. I was going back and forth between liking it and not liking it. I was against the use of Cheez Wiz on this one because that's just not how you do carne asada fries. But does it taste good? Absolutely! 4/5  Horchata: I haven't had horchata I didn't like. Their version is good but a bit sweeter and reminded me of cake icing for some reason. 3.5/5  They have tables on the side and a a drive-through. It's nothing fancy and the area is not the best. CASH only."}
{"text":"The brother in law took us here for some tortas the other day, it's in a small shopping center. When we got inside you could see the fresh bread laid out, and two ladies in by the grill making tortas. They have a full menu not only sandwiches but burritos, plates, combos, and seafood dishes as well! They also have fresh juices and smoothies! I ordered the Milanesa torta, and it was delish! It was serves with potato chips and a jalapeño! So good! I finished the whole thing! I ate it so fast I forgot to take a pic!   They also had mariachi walking around taking song requests and our server was very nice! And they have the yummy ol coke in a bottle! Schweeeeet! Will definitely be back for some more delicious tortas!!"}
{"text":"Tortas el Rey is the best place to eat real Mexican food. Best in Phoenix, AZ I highly recommend Don't forget to add chipotle on everything burritos, tortas and my favorite huarache de asada..... You're welcome"}
{"text":"My husband and I were visiting AZ and we found this spot. It was awesome. My husband had the torta El Rey and I tried it. We both agree it was an incredible flavor combination and skillfully made. Neither one of us have had a torta like that here or in Mexico. It's special. The aguas frescas were huge, fresh and wonderful. I had the hurache sencillo and it was simply delicious."}
{"text":"The placement of this restaurant is in a strip mall in a kinda crummy neighbor hood, but don't let that stop you from checking out this place! Do yourself a favor & order the torta el rey (if you're super hungry!). It has EVERYTHING on it, & somehow still manages to be balanced in it's awesome flavors. It's literally two meals in one sandwich! And for only $6.99 it's a steal! For myself, I got the hawanios tacos & they were superb! Chopped beef, pineapples, bacon, ham & chorizo with melty cheese on 3, double white corn tortillas, can it get any better than that? Oh yeah, for only $5.99 too! I'm was in heaven!  Don't expect 5 star dining, it's pretty much a hole in the wall, but they can crank out some fuego! We will definitely be returning! Service was on point too! Also, get a Hibiscus water.... You will be glad you did!"}
{"text":"The best Mexican food I've had can't really go wrong with anything that you order, everything is freaking good. Their ceviche is probably one of the best I've tried so far it has so much flavor we always make sure to order a tostada de ceviche. Their orange juice is amazing too. Mouth watering already just try them out they are good and staff is always very friendly which is a plus"}
{"text":"Great, authentic Mexican food! Wow! We had quesadillas de maíz - carne asada, chicharrón, pollo tinga and tostada de camarón. Fantastic! Cheap! One quesadilla is enough for two; they are HUGE! The ambiance is not that great, but for the flavor, it doesn't matter. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Even though short staffed very good staff and delicious food ... loved the vibe and I'll be back"}
{"text":"This place lives up to the name!! Hands down the best Mexican food in Arizona!! Highly recommended to those that haven't  tried this place!!"}
