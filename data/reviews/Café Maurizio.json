{"text":"Believe all the the bad reviews about this place. A friend and I went in hoping to get some food walking down St Laurent - it was extremely bad and a waste of money. We both ordered fish and chips and they were literally the frozen fish fillets with no flavour, were cold, and the fries were undercooked McCain fries. The tartar sauce was some special horseradish and mayo mixture that was barely edible. To top it off they only had two beers on tap and were not allowed to order a pitcher. A pretty big disappointment considering the man who coaxed us in - I pretty creepily - sold it as a \"bar/restaurant/lounge.\" If you think I'm exaggerating take a look at the picture and see for yourself. Really not worth it! Very bad food, confused ambiance, and overpriced."}
{"text":"This place is a secret gem!!! It is so great I almost do not want to share it with the world!!! It is my favorite restaurant in the city. 

It is family run and you can taste the pride in every single bite of their food!

This restaurant is for palates of expensive taste for an affordable price!"}
{"text":"Went for supper on a weekday the service was great, waitress super friendly but the food was mediocre. A bit too pricy for the quality we got."}
{"text":"I honestly dont know why they are still open. I bought their livingsocial deal and it was about to expire so I hurried to use it with my boyfriend. As we we found the resto and entered, I found the decoration pleasing but as we sat down and saw the menu for our livingsocial coupon...NOT IMPRESSED! I found the prices for the appetizers to be ridiculous and not worth it. We were only allowed to pick a limit of 7$ for the appetizers which is ridiculous because there was only 2 items: the soup du jour and a really not so good bruschetta. I took the bruschetta and my boyfriend took the soup. I would NEVER pay 6.95$ for neither. 

After the main course had a limit of 17$. I took the 4 cheeses pizza which was really good because of its thin crust and my bf took a plain spaghetti cuz he is lactose intolerant. But cmon....16.95$ for a plain spaghetti screams overpriced! 

Last but not least, i wanted a classic italian dessert that was homemade....nothing was homemade on the dessert menu. very disappointing! 

I also really got annoyed because when i usually use a livingsocial coupon, I have never been asked to print it and I basically just show it and they write down the voucher number. The lady who is probably the owner, didnt stop annoying me about printing it and then she comes to me with a paper with their email and pressed me to email them the coupon and didnt stop harassing me about the damn coupon. 

really disappointed!!! Never again will I ever go to the resto! U have my word"}
{"text":"Good food, great value.  And great fun because of great service and great people.  No it is not 5 star dining, but the 5 star would cost 3 times as much and would not be as enjoyable.  A solid choice. We went back the second nite."}
{"text":"This is not \"authentic Italian food\". We should have known it was going to be bad when no one else was in the front dining room. Are French Fries authentic Italian food? Just asking... Our meal started with bread service and olive oil for dipping. This was the highlight of the meal. The salad was drenched in mustard vinegar. Next up was our 24 dollar steak. Now when I order a 24 dollar main course I kinda expect the waiter to explain that it only comes with fries. No vegetables, no nice starch side, no authentic Italian anything. The steak itself was garbage quality, full of fat and bones. Lastly the waiter was in denial that this food sucked. I asked him what was a signature Italian dish? He just said pasta, it was obvious that we had a bad dining experience when we left over half the meat and the Authentic Italian French Fries on are plate. I'm not sure how desserts are here because we just left. In short DO NOT go here."}
{"text":"Food was good. The owner is great. We had good bottle of wine called Citra. 



Caesar"}
{"text":"I had a great experience at this restaurant! I came in for an early dinner and was pleased with the attentiveness of the staff. The owner was delightful; she made me feel at home as I was dining alone. She was pleasant and helpful with my selections. I ordered the red sangria and decided on one of their pizzas. The pizza was truly delicious. I've had plenty of home-made meals in Italy and even in the Italian country side. I will say that the authentic pizza and the friendly service reminded me of the time I had spent in Italy. Thank you for a memorable experience!"}
{"text":"didnt want to honorate my TUANGO coupons for the date and time i've tryed to get a reservation... I've called 3 times, for 3 different days and times"}
{"text":"Ok restaurant, good choice of pastas and pizzas. Wine list very limited, a little expensive for what it is. 
Service was nice and polite.
My pizza Latino was too greasy for my taste, my daughter's quarto fromagi was clearly 'too flexible'. $110 for 3 is too high for what you get here."}
{"text":"Great location right on Blvd St. Laurent with tables right beside the public walk. The service is good and the staff is friendly, but.......... And this is a BIG but.........the food - not so good. 
The spaghetti with smoked salmon was 'swimming' in sauce and the smoked salmon was lost in the blend. The presentation was un-inspired and the flavour 'muddy'. 
The burger with blue cheese, burnt bun, un-evenly applied condiments, greasy fries, caesar salad dripping with dressing.
The actual patty was obviously some cheap frozen burger, that had alot of water seeping out of it, as well as a strange texture.  
In closing, way too expensive for what you receive. 
Never again!"}
{"text":"I stopped here for a couple drinks and appy, but after a couple drinks I ended up ordering a rib eye.  That's how it goes sometimes!  It was very good.  What I enjoyed even more, however, was the atmosphere of the restaurant.  We were out on the patio, Fringe Fest was on so there was a lot of action!  I'd like to go back and try it when things are a little more quiet.  Service was very good, very attentive.  I'd definitely go back, maybe actually order an appetizer..."}
{"text":"Great specials every day.  Walked in for their breakfast special: 2 eggs, toast, potatoes and fruit.  All for just $4.95!

They also have daily lunch specials at just $9.95.  My friend picked up the Margherita Pizza and liked it."}
{"text":"This place is not as bad as the Yelp reviews describe. Our lunch was tasty and the Bloody Caesar was also well-priced and delicious."}
{"text":"This is the only restaurant I have felt compelled to write a review about.  I visited Montreal in the last week of September and was ushered into the restaurant for dinner by Maurizio's cousin.  The restaurant was relatively empty and my first experience was that the beer taps weren't working so I had to stick with bottles.  Despite these warning signs we stayed, and am ever so glad that I did.  We ended up ordering a margharita pizza and penne in meat sauce - pretty standard items for an italian restaurant - and were more than a little surprised by the INCREDIBLE meat sauce, pizza dough, and general taste.  We have been to more than a few italian restaurants and, while I can't speak to authenticity or originality, these common dishes were certainly the best we had ever had.  I will be sure to make a stop here any time I am in Montreal."}
{"text":"Horrible service. I am sitting here now, have been here for over an hour, and have not been served yet. Don't come here."}
{"text":"I have to say that I've only ever been for brunch, but I loved it, and because the service is so amazing and the place is so flawlessly clean (yes the washrooms are sparkling), I'm giving it 5 stars. I can't comment on the lunch/dinner food yet, but I really like the brunch here. It's cheap, tasty, and not too greasy or heavy feeling - except for the homefries but those are so worth it because they're probably the best I've had in this city so far. 

This isn't a fancy breakfast place, but it's a shockingly inexpensive place that's good enough to become my regular default brunch spot!

Oh and I forgot to mention that there's a small back terrace in the summer, so that's always a plus!"}
{"text":"Now, I'm not a very big Italian foodie. In fact, if I had to eat pasta or human flesh, I would have to take a minute to think about it. So I went out with My Uncle Larito and his girlfriend, Nancita and their friend Anita. 

The outside of the establishment was a little rough, the CA from the word CAFE was missing, and there was a running joke that Cafe Maurizio was a cafe of the fairies. I understand that this place is now under new management (due to a very hokey red banner over the door).  Inside we are greeted by two thick curtains separated by a pillar. I was a little afraid that I would hit someone on the other side. Nancita went through the curtain with grace, but I was a little clumsy as the drape decided to get to know me better by clinging to my jacket. Once inside, Fe Maurizio is quite large and very well decorated. A large bar with various wines and liqueurs, a small pastry case at the end with a small window that looks into the kitchen. Very Clean. 

We sat down in quite a nice spot, in the front part of the restaurant. There were a few other parties farther back in the restaurant that seemed to be having a good time. The table was clean, neat, and very well set. We were greeted by our 'waiter'. He didn't have the air of a waiter, but rather the proprietor. Larito was curious and joked around with our waiter Raphael. He was really quite a great person to serve us. He even took a look at my wrist problem after saying that he studied massage. He was quite the wonderful addition to our meal experience. He was very forthcoming with his recommendations on the menu. Larito took his suggestion head on and ordered the Ravioli in a rose sauce. Nancita went with the Spaghetti Picasso. I got the cannelloni meal deal that came with coffee, Caesar salad, and a dessert. Anita was craving bruschetta and asked for a side of balsamic vinegar with some boconchini. 

The meal was quite good. The cannelloni came with three pieces in a red sauce. The pieces were not thicker than a loonie with a meat mixture inside. I would have liked to have been told this. I love my cheese and spinach cannelloni when I decide not to eat human flesh. I had a few bites of Larito's ravioli, which was quite nice. The rose sauce was round but not overpowering. There were bits of ham and other things floating around with the pasta. All in all, it was nice. The Spaghetti Picasso, however, I found not all that amazing. In fact, it was overpowering. There were olives with sundried tomatoes and mushrooms in a rose sauce. All of the flavours were so overwhelming that I couldn't take more than one bite. A different type of pasta would have worked better as well. I didn't have the bruschetta, but I was told it was wonderful. It was tomato on thinner bread, almost a pita. She had drizzled balsamic and oil all over it. Honestly, if I wasn't so full from my three (yes, they were actually filling) cannelloni, I would have loved to have a bite. It did look fantastic. 

Raphael did some back a few times, not as much as I would have liked considering that there were only two or three other parties dining that night. We had finished eating and sat there for five or so minuted before the plates were collected. I also had to ask for my coffee and dessert. The coffee was okay, not the best I've ever had, but more of a standard fare. Nancita had a cafe mocha, which came with a generous amount of real whipped cream on top. She ordered two of them, so I'm assuming that it was good. Raphael was very accommodating with the dessert, he split it in two so that we all could enjoy it. 

The dessert was some kind of walnut brownie that had a fudge-base frosting on top. It would have been better if it wasn't cold. It was also dry, but can I honestly expect a restaurant that is missing their 'CA' out front to have a pastry hand? No, no, and definitely not. 

All in all, the experience was a positive one. The prices were on the higher side, especially for pasta. I guess I'm spoiled, I've only ever found one man that can make pasta that I enjoy, and that is my Grandfather. His putanesca sauce is to die for, and this is coming from me - the 'I'd rather eat human flesh' lady. I am very neutral to this place, I do not know if the architecture was due to the new management, and I'm guessing renaming this establishment into a Resto Cafe rather than just a Cafe was the reason for Fe Maurizio hanging overhead. 

It was good, but not good enough that I'd put it aside in my mind as a place that I'd love to go to again. Any asian places in the area? :D"}
{"text":"Have been in this restaurant only for brunch. The food and service are OK. There are no egg whites on the menu, but the personnel was nice to substitute my eggs order. The latte and cappuccino may come in nice bowls depending on the size of your order.  
The best of this place is the wonderful back yard terrace, nice spot for summer days."}
{"text":"A nice Italian Cafe in the West Island of Montreal. This place serves a lot of variety. they serve some italian food, frankly I haven't eat there once, but they mostly serve pasta meal. There's one specialy for the Moka coffee amateur. It's a coffee, thick with chocolate pudding in it.... don't judge it before you've tasted it! It's really good."}
{"text":"I didn't bother looking up Cafe Maurizio on Yelp before coming since I came here and I hadn't heard much about it before so I wasn't sure what to expect.  Having seen the rating for this restaurant now though I have to say that I agree with it.   The location is excellent being right on Saint Laurent just north of Sherbrooke but everything else left me feeling underwhelmed.

I came here for a special event and since we were a large group we got a special deal which for $21 got each person an antipasto, choice of pizza and dessert.  To make things easier they asked that everyone pay cash beforehand and after tip and taxes it was $27.  Alcohol was not included in this.

The service was quite spotty.  I get that we were a fairly large group (20+ people) but a reservation had been made well in advance so they should have accounted for this.  Some people only received their pizzas after everyone else had finished theirs and my pizza was quite tepid when I received it.  It was also quite difficult to get the waiter's attention so that I could order wine.  Basically anyone who wanted wine had to flag down the server to when this is something they should have come around to ask if we wanted any.

The food itself was also kind of lacklustre.  The antipasto was a mix of items like bocconcini, melanzane (eggplant) and prosciutto and that was pretty good.  After that though the rest of the meal went downhill.  As I mentioned before my pizza was lukewarm at best when I received it.  Even if it had been served hot it wouldn't have been the greatest.  I had the Latina which came with rapini and sausage.  The rapini had no flavour to it and was very mushy so it was probably overcooked.  The cheese they used was of low quality and the crust was too dense and not cooked very well.  I'm of the opinion that the best pizzas are made in wood-burning ovens as it gives the crust a smokey flavour that can't be reproduced in an electric oven.  Dessert was a pastel de nata which was a little surprising considering it was supposed to be an Italian restaurant.  It tasted okay but certainly not one of the best that I have had."}
{"text":"On n'y va certainement pas pour de l'authentique cuisine italienne. On se perd entre une infinie liste de pizzas , des cheese burgers et du fish n chip. Donc, pas étonnant que les plats italiens (en l'occurrence un plat de raviolis) soient approximatifs. Aucune saveur typique dans la sauce telles celles du basilic ou de l'huile d'olive. La salade César est plus qu'ordinaire. Les légumes d'accompagnement des plats de viande (ici du poulet bien fade) sont sans saveur et d'une couleur sans éclat. Résultat du \"réchauffé.  Sinon, que dire de ce  serveur qui parle à voix haute à deux jeunes clientes, visiblement amusées, du retour de Jésus sur terre? Invraisemblable!"}
{"text":"C'est par hasard que nous sommes allez manger chez Maurizio a 14h30, ce 1er janvier 2015 alors que beaucoup d'autres restaurants étaient fermés.

L'endroit a l'air neuf, la décoration est raffinée, la musique conviviale, l'ambiance agréable, l'accueil chaleureux. 

La carte a juste ce qu'il faut pour laisser un choix satisfaisant à tout le monde et les prix sont abordables.

Des petits pains chauds nous ont été servi avec une petite assiette d'huile d'olive et de vinaigre balsamique pour saucer. Très bon.
Les tortellinis étaient fraîches dans une sauce a la viande et herbes finement coupés.
Le saumon grillé était très bon et les légumes étaient parfaitement cuits.
En dessert, un pasteis de nata chaud, un dessert portugais mais tellement délicieux!! 

Notre 1er repas de l'année a été une vraie réussite grâce à Maurizio et sa délicieuse cuisine! 

Ils relèvent le niveau, rien a voir avec les restaurants italiens de Saint-Denis a la décoration surchargée, défraîchie et kitsch, où les serveurs ont l'air fatigué de voir du monde et où la cuisine est douteuse.

Nous avons été ravis et nous y retourneront, c'est certain! Merci :))"}
{"text":"Maurizio was by far one of the yummiest places I visited in Montreal. The paninis are AMAZING! Also, HIGHLLLLY recommend their drinks. The owners are beyond sweet and the women treated me and my friend with two free lemon drops. We had at least 6 different types of drinks of their long list of options. Definitely coming back every time I visit Montreal."}
{"text":"Le restaurant est très beau et l'ambiance est accueillante. Par contre, la nourriture n'est pas à la hauteur de la décoration, le petit pain était pratiquement congelé lorsqu'il a été servi. De plus, les bruschettas avaient beaucoup trop d'ail et de sel. Le dessert était une tartelette beaucoup trop sèche"}
{"text":"Cet endroit est un point de chute populaire pour les rendez-vous d'affaires des gens du coin. La cuisine est assez ordinaire, hélàs et le service est toujours assez lent. Mais bon, le prix est correct et l'expérience est pratique."}
{"text":"Let me keep this brief.  Mediocre food at best and the lack of service is shocking. Waited for an hour for sandwiches and over dressed Caesar salad. 
Thanks but no thanks."}
