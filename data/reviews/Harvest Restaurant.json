{"text":"We celebrated our anniversary at this lovely little tucked away restaurant in Brooklin. We were seated at a table upstairs in a somewhat cosy nook and while there were other diners nearby it still felt quite intimate. 
I started with the crispy baked cauliflower with a lovely tandoori barbeque sauce and my husband had fresh Caesar salad which was not overdressed. We had ordered the smoked mac & cheese to share as a side which never came but that was fine with us because between appetizers and our main course we were full at the end of dinner. Hubby had the  Cornish hen with polenta fries which were tender yet crispy and I had the salmon on a bed of soba noodles. Little salty but the salmon was done to perfection and just the right potion. The service was efficient and not overly personal which was fine by us. We do plan to return to have that yummy sounding mac & cheese and perhaps indulgent dessert. The patio looks lovely so look forward to returning in warmer weather!"}
{"text":"We live in DC Ranch and based on fellow Yelpers reviews, decided to give this a shot for Sunday brunch/lunch. The place looks good and it has a nice feel to it. We were unfortunately seated back by the restrooms and think the front of the house would have been airier. Our server was very friendly and make good bloody marys, although they took quite a while and the restaurant was not that busy. I wanted to taste the Duck Tacos based on the reviews so I asked for the dinner menu for future reference. While they do have a Happy Hou 3-7 with some $4.95 the DTs are not included in the deal (nor were most of the other good apps). Our server said, \"that sign is very misleading. People think it is all apps which is what we thought.\" We still will go back this week to try out that food at HH. Back to brunch...hubby had cheesy hash omelette w/potatoes. The omelette was ok but made with canned corned beef hash. We expected more. It was flavorful but runny. I had the Desert Dog; a chili dog with onions and cheese. It was very good. Our son had a grilled cheese on sourdough that was delicious. All in all, good comfort food. I am most interested in coming back to try the night entrees and apps. Also, there was an error on our bill (I catch one almost everywhere) and it seemed to be a big hassle to fix so I let it go. The server said someone else found the same error (overcharge on kids fruit) but\" they never changed it in the computer.\" To be a sustaining family restaurant, those things need to be put right. Will give it another try for Happy Hour apps...."}
{"text":"My scrambled eggs were burnt and more like an egg pancake and when we told the server she didn't even remove them from the bill. Then she came back to clear our plates and started mocking me to my boyfriend, WOW unprofessional. Make sure you never get Linda as a server top 5 worst service ever."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Quality settings in true  Broolkin style. The BBQ Cauliflower and grilled Brussels sprout appetizers are out of this world. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I have to say it is refreshing to get another brunch place in the area besides Kashman's.  I have eaten there twice and have gotten the same thing.  I strongly recommend the \"Gobble Gobble\" wrap. The turkey was fresh inside along with yummy stuffing and cranberry sauce.  If you miss that Thanksgiving meal, it is a great choice. My husband ordered the turkey burger along with sweet potato fries. We thoroughly enjoyed the sweet potato fries, but he enjoyed my wrap better than his turkey burger.  My father in law got the lox, bagel, and cream cheese and said the lox was very fresh tasting.  My mother in law got eggs along with a side of fruit. The fruit included strawberries, blueberries, and bananas which looked very fresh and a great combo rather than most places that just have mixed melon for their sides of fruit.  The items are not overpriced on the menu either.  I hear they are open for dinner now, but I have not seen the dinner menu yet. Lastly, everyone I have gone with has commented on the ambiance of the restaurant looking very clean and comfortable.  If you just want a casual breakfast or lunch in the area, go try out Harvest."}
{"text":"Been to Harvest three times now.  Once for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Breakfast is the star at Harvest.  The Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs was great.  In particular, the sausage gravy had big chunks of sausage and was nice and spicy.  Eggs over medium were just right with no runny whites but runny, warm yolks.   My wife had the lox plate and said it was both delicious and was very generous with the lox.
Lunch was also very good.  Huge reasonably priced burgers grilled from fresh ground beef.  The Eggplant Burger was excellent (if not sloppy) with a couple of fried eggplant slices, mozzarella cheese, and red sauce surrounding the patty.  It also had lettuce and tomato on it which would have been better left on the side to add as one wishes.  The lettuce and tomato really don't go well with the Italian flavors.  
For dinner we had Wiener schnitzel (SP?).  It was okay.  When I have had this dish in the past (can't spell that again!) the meat is usually pounded very thin and comes with noodles.  The meat was ordinary and a little chewier than schnitzel should be.  The crust was not well adhered as well.  Finally, the mashed potatoes were excellent, but would have preferred the traditional Spaetzle noodles.
Service has been average and the folks working there are nice enough.  Nothing stands out good or bad regarding the service.  All in all, would probably be 3.5 stars if such a thing existed.  I'm going with 4 though because the prices are VERY reasonable for North Scottsdale.  I'll definitely be a regular for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Our Foodie Adventure has just begun!!!  Had dinner at The Harvest Restaurant last night.  We asked if we could just sleep there so we could have breakfast too.  Seriously, this place has killer food!

It also has a relaxing atmosphere and friendly staff.  The three of us shared Duck Tacos, Fried Calamari and Lobster Bisque. All were outstanding.  The Calamari was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, served with Homemade Marinara Sause.  Yummy!  I also have to mention the bread cause its my favorite addiction.  Four kinds with whipped butter.

My entree was Garlic Shrimp & Grape Tomato over Angel Hair with snow peas and fresh basil.  The shrimp were sweet and buttery, the flavors blended perfectly.  My husband had Roasted Long Island Duck with Citrus Orange Sauce.  It was so good that he picked the last bits of  Daffy off the bones with his fingers.  My daughter had the Lemon Pepper Shrimp which she chose not to share with anyone cause, \"they are too good\".

Believe it or not, we even had dessert. Fresh Mixed Berry Pie, topped with latice crust and whipped cream.  Bananas Foster, covered with buttery cinnamon sauce and ice cream.  Both were \"to die for\".

Bottom line is, we can't wait to go back again and again.  Breakfast and lunch, here we come!!!"}
{"text":"I would give Harvest a 0 but the only reason I'm giving 1 out of 5 is because the place has an absolutely beautiful patio and apparently the food was good from what the group I went with told me. I didn't end up eating my meal but we'll get to that... So I'll start from the beginning. 

I am a vegan and usually theres always something for me to eat when I go out to a restaurant. I was with a party of 6 so 1 week prior a friend made the reservation and told the lady to put on file that there will be 1 vegan at the table. So the night before we go to Harvest I decided to give them a call just to make sure they knew I was vegan and to see what they recommended (which was the mediterranean strudel and it does have cheese in it but can easily be removed) Sounds wonderful. Perfect. I'll have that.

Upon arrival the waiter met us at the table, I looked him in the eyes and said I was the vegan and this dinner was also for my birthday. He acknowledges and takes our drink orders. 3 out of the 6 people get their drinks. 20 minutes go by and the other 3 of us still don't have our drinks. We get up and ask whats taking so long, they bring it about 10 minutes later. The confusion was when we ordered 2 caesars and a pepsi he thought.... caesar salad ..... ok what ever no big deal. 

Now comes time to order the food. I once again reiterate that I am vegan and the mediterranean strudel was recommended to me without cheese so I'll go with that. Amazing. Great. Can't wait to try this delicious meal. So food comes and it looks unreal ! I start on my veggies to the side of the plate and my fiancé said wow that looks awesome can I have a bit? So he digs in... Stops... says uhm thats goat cheese in the middle. I said what the hell, no way. Iv'e told them 4 times.. not once.. 4 TIMES ! Everyone at the table tries it and all in agreement that indeed there is goat cheese in the strudel. 

Waiter comes over and I show him the cheese, he profusely apologizes and asks if he can get me anything else. I say absolutely not. Wife of the chef comes over apologetic and also asks if I would like anything else and once again I said no. At this point I just wanted to leave. 

I still don't know who's fault this was, waiter or chef or both but to me that was ridiculous and unacceptable. Was it because I just said I was vegan that they didn't really pay attention? What if I said I was lactose or very allergic to dairy, would that have made a difference? 

Our bills come (not fast enough) and the waiter tells me that they have taken off the strudel for me... Well ya of course I'm not paying for that. So our $40.00 bill some how turned into $101.00 ?? How incompetent are you people. Apparently he made huge mistakes and all of our bills were mixed up. 40 minutes later our bills are figured out and everyone is miserable.  7:45 reservation and we left there after 10:30. Poor service, poor attention to details, poor time management. 

I will never return here even if someone paid me. Save your money."}
{"text":"Wonderful food staff are attentative and service is great. The owners are amazing.

While the menu is short it has everything.  Beef chicken fish. The butternut squash soup is amazing.  And yes they carry my scotch.  Glenmorange. 

And the bread is to die for..."}
{"text":"We had a great meal here for my birthday and were treated well and fed well. The martini was pretty good but not dirty enough for my taste. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"We have been meaning to get in here for a while. As Roland W says, it's a couple doors down from the very-awesome Summit Cleaners, but that's another review...

I think this used to be a bank and the decor is very cool and the layout is nice. I hate to compare to The Good Egg (which is also very close for us), but Harvest is priced about the same, the food is better, and, as my GF says, her grandma's furniture didn't vomit on the walls. 

Being hungover, my buddy and I had the chicken fried steak covered with country gravy. Now, I had heard this place was a little uppity and overpriced, being in the location that it is... not so... If a joint gets their chicken fried steak right, they can't possibly be uppity. The CFS was awesome, packed full of flavorful, empty calories, and includes potatoes and toast (not giving a sh&t about my health is a delightful release). The GF had french toast with fruit and she delighted in the cinnamon mixed with powdered sugar that was sprinkled on top.

Good service, three entrees (one with side bacon), a coffee, tea, and fresh OJ all for $40. Not bad value at all. Sorry Harvest, I gotta remove one star for the absence of real breakfast tea, though. Not everyone likes herbal.

We'll stumble back for sure."}
{"text":"I'd been wanting to try this place ever since we moved to Brooklin several months ago and Whitbylicious was the perfect opportunity to try it out with my fiancée and parents. Both the quantity and quality of food was amazing. Everyone in our party raved about every single course. My favourite part of my meal was the mushroom strudel; although I also stole a bite of my fiancée's brownie and omg yum. Thank you, Harvest, for an exceptional dining experience!"}
{"text":"Another visit to Harvest and another exceptional experience. There were 11 in our party this time and we were originally seated outside on the stunning patio. Unfortunately it began to rain which had already been accommodated beforehand and we were moved inside to a table.
The food was delicious - again not one complaint from anyone in our group!!
I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Harvest to anyone!"}
{"text":"To all our patrons, I want to thank you on behalf of the entire team for all your support these past 15 months. We closed our doors last night sadly , but we are grateful for all your support. Thanks for the friendships and smiles--we hope to meet you again on the foodie trail.

George Melchor, senior staff member  (lol)."}
{"text":"Enjoyed great service but was let down by just okay food. Pork tenderloin was nice but lacked subtlety in the flavours that you would expect for a $24 plate. Washroom also smelled funny. Maybe more cleaning is needed. My partner enjoyed her burger."}
{"text":"Five stars for the NEW Soul Cafe which has taken the place of the Harvest Restaurant. 

You want great pancakes? Go to this cafe. You want a great dinner? Guess where to go. 
Fine dining, excellent food quality, delicious meals, great service and very good value for the dollar spent. 

This and the owner's other restaurant in Cave Creek are our favorites and I would strongly recommend anyone go here for not only a delicious breakfast, dinner and lunch but for the money you will spend, it cannot be beat!!"}
{"text":"Me and my husband came here last Saturday for dinner. Both our meals were incredible. I had the duck, with Brussel sprouts and mushroom risotto. And he had the sea bass with shrimp and corn chowder. I'm usually never impressed with meals from a restaurant. Harvest exceeded my expectations! Our server Hillary was great! She had great suggestions for us,as well as she was very personable. Overall we had an awesome experience. We will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"After reading reviews was very excited to try this place out. The food was pretty good but COLD. Felt a bit cramped upstairs. May try it again and hope the food is warm/hot."}
{"text":"Sat on the patio on this warm June day.  The house shielded us from the wind but we were thankful for the umbrella to protect us from the sun.  Looking out into the backyard area is very tranquil.  

We had their portobello bruschetta and cauliflower bites to start.  Both were exceptional. 

Two in my group had the burger which they said was a bit messy but tasted amazing.  I had the southern fried chicken sandwich.  It was delicious.  


All in all a fantastic fresh food experience"}
{"text":"Went into Harvest recently because we were at the CIGNA clinic and because of time constraints, we needed to eat within walking distance.

Didn't really want to go there, but thought I'd give it another shot.

Anyway, much better, Harvest!  

Service was very good.  Food was good.  Kiddo had chicken fingers again and still well-proportioned for a kid's entree.  I had a chicken caesar salad.  Chicken wasn't dry and caesar dressing was pretty decent.  Good-sized portion for the price point.

And, they rectified the poor lighting situation!  Hurray!  My kiddo was able to pee without the lights turning off.

We'll be back to Harvest to check out breakfast soon."}
{"text":"I am not sure if I went on an off day or what.  My omelet was less than mediocre.  My in-laws had sandwiches that came in regular sliced white sandwich bread, yuck! My husband had another omelet and he didn't finished his either.  My friend keeps asking me to go there with her, but I am too traumatized."}
{"text":"I would be hard pressed to remember a less professional, more poorly trained,  disorganized, staff and management....covering up mislabeled, mediocre food. In a city filled with Restaurants that have excellent food and reputations.... with generally cordial and professional service... this place should be put down (like a horse) to free it from it's misery. Save your money or go to Denny's."}
{"text":"Just got back from lunch here, and I must say it was delicious! We sat outside on the patio which was very nice on such a pretty sunny day. I had the beef gyro which was huge and so so yummy! It came with a fresh greek salad and a yogurt sauce and I couldn't have asked for anything more.

Definitely recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had breakfast here last weekend. We both ordered omelets. He had the ham and cheese, I had the avocado, spinach and bacon. The food was served quickly. One look at the plate and I realized why. The eggs were not so much an omelet as they were an egg pancake that spanned the plate with traces of the aforementioned fillings tucked here and there. The eggs were not light and fluffy the way an omelet should be, but browned and tough like they were cooked on heat that was way too high. The dish came with sliced potatoes that looked a mess--all clumped together and more mushy than crisp tender. When I ordered my coffee, I was told a fresh pot was currently being brewed. I was excited to receive fresh coffee, but when it came to the table, it was far too strong and bitter. On the plus side, the wheat toast was quite good. For the future, though, if I want good toast, I think I'll skip the $25 bill and just spend $4-$5 for a good loaf of wheat bread and stay home. Will most likely not be giving Harvest Restaurant a second chance."}
{"text":"As we sit here with blissfully overly full bellies, we decided to take this moment to reflect on our experience at Harvest.  Bottom line: great breakfast experience.  Loved the decor, and the food in our estimation was well done, huge portions, and affordable!  We'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"This is a must visit. The staff is happy and bubbly. The decor is earthy yet classy and the food is outstanding and to top it off they serve breakfast til 3pm!!!  There omletes are amazing and who doesn't luv sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"I was staying at the JW Marriott and decided to take a drive over here for breakfast. What a great idea. Amazing pancakes and generous portions. 

Sitting outside enjoying a great meal - can not be beat. Great friendly service"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the restaurant, I think the layout and decor are comfortable and inviting. The staff are courteous and friendly, taking the time to make eye contact and entertain your children. The food is great and the prices are reasonable especially in this part of town. I will definitely be going back here and recommending it to friends!"}
{"text":"Small space with a lot of character. Service was very good, the waitress we had was very attentive without being annoying. Bread was warm with very rich butter. Kids pasta was very good and portion was large. I had ducks 2 ways, which was very tasty. Earthy mushrooms with a nice duck ready. The duck leg fritter was just okay, would rather had it in a confit. Wife's risotto was very earthy and rich, I am not a risotto fan but my wife said it was just okay. I found for the price to be good value versus quality. We would try it again for sure."}
{"text":"I REALLY wanted to like this place. It's a locally owned family restaurant in a prime location in the lovely town of Brooklin.

The building is gorgeous. 

However, what they claim to be is not what they deliver on. Sadly I feel like this is a case of a restaurant trying to be something they are not and missing the mark.

They claim that the menu is seasonally driven with local / Canadian suppliers.

I asked the server what cocktail she recommended and she said \"I don't know, the strawberry basil lemon-aide is good.\" I thought this was an odd cocktail choice for February and doesn't scream \"seasonally inspired\".

I ordered a class of perseco instead. It was lovely but came in a stemless glass which is pet peeve of mine. 

We had told the server that it was our first time here and she didn't seem to care and didn't offer any menu suggestions. I asked what the daily special was and she said they didn't have any daily specials. I was surprised because the website said that the menu sometimes changes daily. Typically restaurants that serve local foods have great daily specials.

We decided to share the crab cakes and charcuterie board. We told her we were sharing these items but she didn't ask if we wanted them severed together or one after each other (which is pretty standard). To our surprise they came out together - our bad, we should have specified. It just made for an awkward eating experience as we reached over each other's plates at the small table. 

CRAB CAKES - (they come 3 to a plate) they are  fried a bit heavier than I like but what turned me off was that it had the texture of canned tuna. It was watery and flavorless. 

CHARCUTERIE - it did not come with olives as the menu detailed. I don't think the mustard or the pickles were homemade at the restaurant or anywhere else. It has 4 cheeses which is usually a great offering but this board consisted of a standard low profile blue cheese and 3 hard varieties of cheddar. All of which were average at best. The variety was lacking. The meat selection was also reminiscent of a supermarket selection. Usually, if a board was truly sourced locally the servers are proud to explain each element and what farm it came from which didn't not happen here. I asked the server if this is their standard board or if it changes frequently - her response was \"nope, this is pretty much it all the time\".

For the entrees I had the bourbon brown sugar pork tenderloin and my fiancée had the steak.

PORK TENDERLOIN - the grilled veggies were delicious but sadly the best part of the dish. The menu said it was served with a mushroom risotto but it wasn't. The risotto is more herbaceous with bright springtime flavours (again, not very seasonal) and has a small amount of mushrooms tossed in upon platting. A true mushroom risotto tastes like mushrooms and has a depth of flavour that is warm and great for a winter side dish. The server told me that they use the same risotto batch for all dishes and just add a different ingredient to \"change it up.\" So here they add mushrooms and for their lamb dish, they simply add cranberries. The pork itself was cooked nicely but the texture of the bourbon and brown sugar was masked by its unpleasant texture. It was grainy and pasty and not strained out and almost like it was thickened with flour that had not been cooked out. It was odd...it missed the mark. It was also platted sloppily and the pork looked like a big brown blob instead of fanning out the slices to showcase the protein.

BLUE CHEESE STEAK - steak was cooked a nice medium rare but the same weak blue cheese from the charcuterie was used here so it lacked that punch and it really lacked seasoning - I don't think that steak saw one grain of salt. The potato purée was the best part of the dish and was delicious however the veggies it came with were predominately more root vegetables. 

We passed on dessert because they were the same offerings that our friend's told us about several months prior. Again, odd for a place that claims they change their menu often. 

I asked the server at the end of the meal how often the menu changes and was told that it stays pretty standard but they change the sauces on their dishes. So the short ribs could have a red wine reduction or a sweet and sour sauce. Not exactly the roaring definition of a restaurant that claims to be seasonally and locally inspired.

I am rating this low because Harvest is claiming to be something they are not. They claim this is the dining experience that Durham has been waiting for...I think people of Durham are well educated diners that deserve better."}
{"text":"If I had to judge the meal solely on my Belgian Waffle with strawberries and ice cream I'd say 5 stars for sure, it was delicious and perfectly crispy.  Unfortunately my husband's Steak and Eggs wasn't so good.  His steak was perfectly cooked, but didn't have any seasonings so it was bland.  The eggs were supposed to be over easy, but they were hard and looked like they had been under a heat lamp for an hour or so.  The potatoes were flimsy and looked like they were made last week.  I'm not sure if we will go back."}
{"text":"My wife just loves this place for breakfast. We decided to try it out for dinner. The roasted duck was a bit on the dry side. Had the sauce on the side which wasn't enough to finish my meal and the vegetables was cooked perfectly. My wife's crab cakes were okay and the sweet potato fries were waffle cut and excellent . 
Our waitress was extremely friendly and made sure we had everything we needed. Even the owner stopped by and chatted with us.
All in all we thought the meal was a bit pricey, but would definitely be back for breakfast."}
{"text":"Good breakfast and good price.

Hubby ordered the Home Omelet which was good/better than average and HUGE. Very large portion. He only ate about half. I ordered the Hawaiian Pancakes that came with pineapple and macadamia nuts (and I also asked for coconut syrup). It was VERY good. Huge portion as well, and I only ate about half. Meal was about $25. A very good deal. Server was attentive and had good suggestions.

We will return if we are ever in North Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Went there today for Sunday brunch - it was hopping!
On the good side:
- Very well decorated
- Clean
- Speedy service
- Big plates of food ;-)

On the downside:
- Food was thrown on the plate
- Potatoes were blah (a little salt and pepper would have helped)
- I had the house omelet, full of runny cheez (I'd swear it was cheez whiz)
- Dining companion had the avocado omelet - not bad, but not great.

We walked out thinking that it's nice to see a local business, we'd like it to do well, but the food needs an upgrade.

Will stick with the Good Egg for brunch."}
{"text":"My wife and I went there for lunch.  It was just ok.  I expected much better based on the reviews.  The food was rather bland and the waiter was unhelpful.  Really disappointing since the venue is so nice."}
{"text":"The town of Whitby needs more restaurants that are upscale and all around good value for the money. The Harvest restaurant doesn't miss the mark on this.

Located in Brooklin, this old house converted into a restaurant reminds me of a smaller version of the Keg on Church street in downtown Toronto.

First impressions, I was quite impressed. It was very cozy and it appears that they make use of every floor and room in this house. Great for first dates, Anniversary, or Birthdays.

Service was excellent, however the room we sat in was quite busy hence it was quite loud. Something about people when too much wine gets into them the volume goes up. :)

The food was excellent, for appetizer we had gnocchi and lobster, for the mains I had short ribs with garlic mash and vegetables, my wife had the pork tenderloin with the mushroom risotto, all were amazing!

Overall definitely recommend this place, it's great to see another fine dining type restaurant in Durham."}
{"text":"I'm definitely a fan of Harvest!

My partner and I decided on breakfast out this morning and I almost forgot about Harvest. I frequent this center often because Summit Cleaners is there and they're darn good too.

Luckily I remembered Harvest and it's so close to the house. We arrived and were seated immediately. The hostess was friendly and the restaurant was buzzing although not so busy that they didn't have a table for us. That's one of the best things as I really don't like waiting for a table on Sunday morning for breakfast. 

I ordered the cheddar and broccoli omelet which came with potatoes and choice of toast, bagel or English muffing. I went with the bagel and everything tasted great. My partner decided on the Banana Nut pancakes which were also delicious. The portions were HUGE and really a great value. Two breakfasts, two Iced Teas for right at 20 bucks. That's so much better than The Good Egg which should really be called the The Bad Egg - it's just way overrated.

Great service, friendly staff and what looks to be a great bar area which we will definitely be back to check out."}

Now hurry up and open will you....already craving your pancakes. Arrgh !

I may camp out by your front door the night before you open...you wouldn't do breakfast in bed would you ?..:-)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Harvest for lunch on Friday. I had worked up quite an appetite after hiking Pinnacle Peak that morning, so I knew I wanted a hearty lunch. 

Harvest is a fairly large restaurant with a nice decor and big, bright windows. They also have patio seating. They offered an extensive menu and a long list of specials (all just $7.95). Our order:

Fresh Turkey Melt w/ sweet potato fries. This sandwich was SO good! Toasty bread, melted mozzarella on both sides of the bread. Turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing, bacon, and tomato inside. Not the healthiest thing in the world, but yum! The sweet potato fries were cross-cut and lightly seasoned. My order was right on. 

Rattle Steak Sandwich and onion rings: My boyfriend said I definitely had the best order. His grilled roast beef with onion, peppers, mushrooms, and cheddar cheese sounded really good, but was kind of lacking in the flavor department. His onion rings, however, were very good! 

It's nice to have another good restaurant option in North Scottsdale. It seems like the type of restaurant where not all the menu items are a hit, but I'd definitely go back for the turkey melt and try some other items."}
{"text":"The only reason I didn't give five stars is because I must try more items on their menu. I really had a hard time deciding- breakfast...lunch.....I decided on breakfast. I had the fruit cup which was really good. Most places give you two maybe three fruits. They had watermelon, canteloupe, honeydew, pineapple, blueberries, stramberries and topped off with slices of banana. This was fresh- not sitting there in juice making everything taste the same. Yum. I also had the whole wheat pancakes with granola which my son finished because they were huge. 

My son got the eggs benedict and home fries and loved it. Along with the rest of my pancakes. ;- )

My husband got the house omelet with home fries and English muffin. He enjoyed every bit.  

Best part of the meal was our fantastic server Crystal. She was a hustler and would bring beverage refills before you hit the bottom. She was extremely attentive and took very good care if us. 

We will definitely be going back and will ask for her."}
