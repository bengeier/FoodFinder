{"text":"Went tonight for a quick dinner which turned out to be over an hour.  Nice decor, very clean but the very slow service (40min wait for our entrees) was way too long.  Never saw the waitress again after we placed the order until it was time for the check.  When the food arrived, it was only lukewarm and despite my attempt to flag down a waiter to refill our drinks, we were basically ignored.  Can't see this place lasting any longer than the other places that have been it this location, will not return."}
{"text":"I ate at several Mexican restaurants around here and this was hands down the best.  The guacamole was fresh and had little chucks of avocado which I love.  The salsa was full of flavor with a hint of hot afterwards .  I had a pork burrito that had amazing flavor and a beef taco that again was perfect.  My wife had a chili relleno that was excellent and our friends also loved their dishes.  The patio is nice this time of the year. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for REAL Mexican food not a tex-mex or American Mexican place.  You will not be disappointed if you like authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"Good service but stay away from the shrimp. Takes forever to get the check though if your in a hurry."}
{"text":"Margaritas are super strong and they have a wide variety of flavors. I love that! Although they could have been colder. Coconut margarita is an interesting one to try. It's sweet and has whipped cream. More like a dessert if anything.  We had three waiters to begin with who took our drink, appetizer and entree orders. If I could ask for anything though it would be please use different cheese! Queso fundido should be more like this: http://www.cookingchanneltv.com/recipes/queso-fundido Don't feel like you need to Americanize it. It's one of the best Mexican dishes.   I would suggest ordering off the specialty menu. Pork carnitas were very good! Well marinaded and good meat to onion ratio. HUGE plate too! We had enough for lunch the next day."}
{"text":"Nice Mexican decor. Food tasted like Two white guys from Minnesota made it. No Flavor at all. Better of to go to Filaberto's  or Los Favoritos for real Mexican food. Here on a Wednesday at 1:00pm and we were the only people in building."}
{"text":"The worst dining experience of my life. The wait staff was god awful. I'll never come back unless I plan on wasting 2 hours of my life waiting for mediocre frozen enchiladas. This place fucking blows."}
{"text":"We love the food here! Everything is made fresh. I normally don't like red sauce but now I order all my enchiladas that way (from this restaurnant ) because it's to die for. They also have awesome margaritas!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has a big menu with a ton of choices . Our group was very happy with what we ordered . Meal was hot and tasted authentic . Good service with many drink choices as well .  Will come back when in Goodyear again"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food restaurant. They have a lot to choose from. Great prices.  Recommend everyone looking for great mexican food"}
{"text":"This place puts La Sala and Nando's to shame.  Fiesta was was really good!! But it was my first time here, so we'll have to see how it goes next time. But I'm from Las Vegas- one of the most delicious food capitals of the world and there's one thing I don't understand about foodies in Chandler, Arizona- they dog good food and give good reviews to crappy food! Lol. It's baffling. Anyway I had the $3.99 margarita (x3!) and it was delish. I had the spicy beef and shrimp dish- it was huge and really good (a little on the greasy side but worth the $17.99) I thought the shrimp were going to be cheap crappy shrimp because they were the little ones- but they were actually good quality shrimp! My daughter had the chicken enchilada suiza plate and it was really tasty (the green sauce was a little on the salty side but very tasty and didn't taste canned - I'll take a little too much sodium over canned sauce any day)! She really liked it. And most important- the chips and salsa! Chips were good-not knock your socks off chips, but not horribly bad either and the salsa was really tasty and fresh with a kick to it- salsa SHOULD have a kick to it and not taste like tomato paste! So- compared to the other mediocre food establishments in Chandler (which is 90% of restaurants in Chandler) - hats off to this place. I hope they keep the quality of the ingredients and flavor up!"}
{"text":"I read a lot of the reviews and I have to say I understand why most of you don't like it. Some of you even state you never been to mexico so do not know what to expect.... Well as a mexican, I can say I was pretty impressed with my meal from here. Went with my wife and inlaws and we all tried a little of each others food and I enjoyed everything we had.... Some one mentioned the chips being in a hotdog basket... Agreed, they need to get a big bowl for those. But for most places here in AZ we end up with Santa fe style food and covered with cilantro to mask bad meat.... This place did not do that to my food.... I hope they make it, would enjoy going again."}
{"text":"This was our first time here! The service was great, didn't even have to wait for a table on a Friday night. We were greeted by several staff members through out our night. They even had live Mariachis. The menu had a lot of choices and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"We have been anxiously awaiting the opening of this  new restaurant.  We went on the second night it was open and we were very pleased!  Service, chips and salsa, food, and drinks were very good!  They have done a wonderful job with the remodel of the interior.  Nice to have another choice in  this area to enjoy - a nice complement to our other excellent Mexican restaurants!"}
{"text":"The Mexican pizza with shredded beef is delicious!!! Great service and fun atmosphere"}
{"text":"Shredded beef, green sauce and chile relleno - delicious! Food does not disappoint.  This place is a welcome addition to the West Valley.  Kids eat free on Mondays. Even though our 12 yr olds don't consider themselves kids, the waiter credited us for a hamburger order. Next time fajitas and margaritas!"}
{"text":"Love the bartenders Christian and Danielle but could do without Liz. She is rude and short with response. She does not respect her employees!!! I would not return if it was for her service!! Pedro and Marlin are also amazing!!!"}
{"text":"The chips were just right and the restaurants food is awesome. Our party loved everything we ordered. Maybe they should add a little more seafood to the seafood burrito. I do like the decorations on the chairs and the tables. The servers,Madie and Cathy, are great but we like them all. And there sopapilla are the best."}
{"text":"This was a unexpected West Valley find. I decided last minute to try it out for lunch and had a great experience. The staff was friendly, the service was top-notch. I ordered the Enchilada suizas with chicken. The meat was tender and fresh. It comes with a small side of slaw as opposed to a few strands of iceberg lettuce and tomato like you see at most Mexican restaurants - nice added touch. The ambiance was festive with attention to details on the southwestern theme. The music was not blaring with loud horns and fast beats, but was soft while still being traditional. My server Elizabeth was friendly, helpful, and very attentive without being overwhelming. As you know, a clean bathroom means a clean kitchen and I'm happy to report that the men's bathroom was also spotless. 4 Stars only because it didn't blow me away with unique options like you would see with gourmet tacos, unique tequila drinks and more. It also may be slightly pricier when compared to the competition. But surely an above average place to go for your standard Mexican fare. They get everything else right."}
{"text":"Rather average and uninspired. Nearly every Mexican restaurant pronounces itself authentic, however Fiesta Mexicana falls well short in that regard with bland, lifeless fare. The atmosphere is open an airy and the service is, well, serviceable. However, the bar is set high when offering Mexican food in Phoenix and there are many more flavorful options. Also, this establishment does not accept American Express, which I find to be unreasonable."}
{"text":"I like the tacos! Friendly staff, and fast service. I went there last weekend and was impressed. Big diverse menu as well. highly recommend."}
{"text":"We go for the lunch special around 1-2 pm on weekdays.  We enjoy friendly and attentive service.  The food is a consistent quality and really good for the price point. A meal for the two of us, without drinks, is usually around $23 and that's including a side order of guacamole.    For 9.99 I get a chile relleno and a small chimichanga with rice and beans every time. I ask for the sauce on the side to keep the chimi and chile relleno crispy.  The chips are plentiful, warm, and crisp and the salsa is hot but not overpowering.  We'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"Came on a Sunday afternoon - very few people in the restaurant so we had our choice of seating. From the start, excellent and attentive service without being smothered which was nice. Ordered guacamole and a side of beans; both came out quickly and were tasty. Not amazing, but tasty nonetheless. Entrees came out next and were HUGE - got the Fiesta Grande and the Carne Asada Burrito. Again both were very tasty but not amazing.  The entire place is very clean - even the restrooms were very well maintained which is a very good sign in my book. The decoration of the restaurant is colorful and fun but not too much - just right.  Recommended for a fun night out for tasty Mexican food with great service and a fun, clean atmosphere."}
{"text":"My first time coming here after a friend tried it and shared on Facebook...I got hungry for some real Mexican food.  This fit the bill perfectly!  The service was prompt and attentive.  The chips and salsa were excellent with some nice heat.  Everyone had something a little different, including chicken fajitas, burritos, shredded beef tacos and cheese enchiladas in addition to rice and beans.  We all were happy and stuffing ourselves.  The portions are a very good size.  No one left hungry. The margaritas are large and mixed to perfection!  To top off am excellent meal, we got not one, but two sopapillas simply for our first check-in on Yelp.  Definitely plan on returning!"}
{"text":"New in the area and we loved this place, the staff are very friendly and attentive. It is clean and well kept, the Margaritas are really tasty and the food was very delicious as well. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"The Mocajete is must try, good for two or three people. The skirt steak was tender as well as the chicken, shrimp and chorizo all seasoned  to perfection. Meal comes with tortillas, rice and beans. Overall the rice was okay, didn't really care for the beans. The chips and salsa was average, just wish the Salsa would have a little bit more kick to it. We had a large party of 14 which they accommodated us on a Friday evening quickly. Lively restaurant with colorful Spanish decor. Happy hour prices for drinks and appetizers are reasonable before 7 o'clock. For the price, and quality you can't beat this restaurant, something to consider when you are in town they have other locations as well throughout Arizona, NM and CO. Overall rating is 4.2"}
{"text":"Service was good, not great. Received dirty plates with our appetizer. Entrees were priced reasonable, portions were good, but the food was bland and lacked any flavor. Drinks were overpriced, $3.50 for a glass of milk with my kids' meal and I paid $1.50 for a tablespoon of sour cream for my meal. Overall, unimpressed and will not return."}
{"text":"My family and I went there last Sunday and enjoyed the experience.  The food was great, the service was good and the atmosphere nice.  My wife and I both had combination plates while our kids ordered from the children menu.   The food came out in a timely manner, was hot and tested great.  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone and will be back."}
{"text":"Food is OK, nothing special. After all the great reviews maybe I was expecting too much. We waited nearly an hour to be seated, I ordered a shredded beef taco and chicken enchilada. The red chile tasted like it was from a can. The shredded beef was ok. Our service wasn't very good. The waitress kept disappearing and never came back for things we asked for. I might try it again, but definitely won't go out of my way to go back."}
{"text":"I first have to say the inside is very festive - so the name is very fitting.  There are a lot of good Mexican food restaurants in the west valley and many are really good as well.  I noticed this place a few weeks ago and decided to give it a try.  The rice and beans are very authentic.  The salsa is really good - somewhat spicier than I usually like but it didn't stop me from asking for more.    What I love about this place is the overall atmosphere.  They have a wide range of entrees as well as deserts.  I also noticed the liquor shelf in the bar area and it is fully loaded with everything one could desire.  I would certainly recommend this for anyone that is looking for great Mexican food experience.  I have my favorite \"Hole in the wall\" that I go to often, but when I want a little change, this will be one of my top choices for sure."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, it was hot and full of flavor. They had a great selection of food and drinks! The ambiance is nice and the service was also nice."}
{"text":"Good food, good drinks, and great service. Just wish I didn t have to drive so far to get good Mexican food."}
{"text":"Not only was the food excellent tonight  but our server Jason (who is new at serving) was wonderful."}
{"text":"Good service and great patio. Food was not very good and atmosphere was decent but place was empty. Worth a try but not highly recommended."}
{"text":"The first visit was very nice opening week with a guitar playing musician that made our date night. Food was good both visits. Service was good the first night a few weeks later service suffered they were very busy both nights not sure if they were just under staffed the second time or just not organized."}
{"text":"One of my new favorite  restaurants!  Everything is so fresh and the service is exceptional.   What my husband and I like about it the most is the range of food and flavors.   Not the same four ingredients you typically associate with Americanized Mexican food."}
{"text":"This is not a kid friendly place. Went in with my husband, 6 year old and almost 2 year old. The hostess didn't ask if we wanted a booster or high chair. Did not inform us of where the kids menu was located in the adult menu. They don't have a separate kids menu with crayons or something to keep them occupied. The chips were stale and the salsa was so so. The meals we ordered were good and our waiter did a fantastic job however we will not be going back."}
{"text":"Just had lunch at Fiesta Mexicana and we're impressed. Salsa is roasted with enough spice to hit the spot The shredded chicken in the enchiladas mole was tender and flavorful. I'm very picky about the quality of the meat and there was absolutely no fat or tough bits - uncommon for your average Mexican restaurant. Husband had the pescado frito and enjoyed it very much.  Service was attentive and sincerely friendly. We'll be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to this restaurant twice. Both times the food was very good, large portions, and an extensive menu. We were fortunate enough to have the same server on both visits.  Excellent service with a smile. We will be taking friends there this week. I think this is the best mexican restaurant in the west valley. It's nice to have a restaurant locally so you don't end up driving 20 miles to eat. Good job!"}
{"text":"Very friendly hostess and waitress. Margaritas \"heart\" were fantastic !!  Myra had great recommendations. Food was very flavorful. We had steak fajitas and Colorado beef burrito which were fantastic. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Don't ever eat fajitas at another Mexican restaurant.  Go for the molcajete fajitas. They say it's for to but it was enough to feed four hungry adults!  BEST FAJITAS EVER!!!!"}
{"text":"The food was cold and no salsa for my Tacos ! The waiters took forever to get back to us . I truly recommend don't waste you money or time . I don't think I will give it a second chance !! Chips & salsa was the only Good thing I ate there . Place is soooo nice but I guess it needs work in there service and food"}
{"text":"This is got to be the best Mexican restaurant on the west side. Their food is great to have a great selection this service is superior. The decor is absolutely Mexican style. And they have the best margaritas I've had."}
{"text":"The Best Nachos. We are from Seattle and love our Mexican food. The nachos are a meal for 2 of us with some to take home. We get half chicken half beef. 5 Stars. Haven't tried anything else, because we don't need too."}
{"text":"This place is definitely underrated! The first time I came here I was a bit skeptical of the quality of food I was going to receive but was pleasantly surprised.   First off the service has always been great with friendly and attentive waiters. Then there is the salsa, if you ask for the hot...man oh man do you get hot!! I recommend mixing both salsas together and you get the best of both worlds. Lastly, no you aren't going to want to count calories if you come here but in my opinion it is worth the extra exercise after consuming this meal. The flavors in everything I've gotten here were just delicious! Recently, I got the super burrito with chicken and it was so tender and flavorful. Also tried some of my friends chili relleno...bomb.com  If you are in Avondale looking for Mexican food then feast your eyes and mouth on this gem!"}
{"text":"Glad to see a Fiesta Mexicana close by.  We have one near our summer home in another state. This was our first time at this location. The facility has a fresh and pleasing decor. We were seated promptly and our chips, salsa and drinks came quickly.  Our food was very good.  The portions were generous. The staff was friendly and helpful. On the way out several spoke to us and one opened the door for our departure. Will definitely go back. The outdoor seating and bar will be a big plus in good weather."}
{"text":"This place may not be the most legit in the area, but it is very good.  I have always enjoyed the Fiesta Mexicana restaurants around (Page, Cortez, CO, Durango, CO), and this one hits just right.  My favorite is always the Carne Asada, even though I shouldn't eat that much food!  We go there for a good standby, and we are never disappointed."}
{"text":"If there was a 1/2 star I'd give it to this place. Customer service was aweful. The hostess couldn't decide where to sit me so she put me by the bar. When asked to be moved to the patio, I was seated by a party which was absolutely fine. The waiter came out & stated that I couldn't sit there because it was a party going on, only to sit me one table over from the party. The margarita tasted like it was tequila free. I was asked if I was going to order anything or just have a drink.  Before I could even tell the waiter what I wanted for dinner, he asked if I wanted\"chicken.\" Needless to say, I didn't feel welcomed from the time that I walked in, so I eventually left before finishing anything. My suggestion for this place is that they work on their customer service. People are from all walks of life & everyone should be treated the same, regardless of where your business is located."}
{"text":"We have been coming to Fiesta Mexicana for probably about 2 years now and it never disappoints! Great service, great food and great margaritas! All the wait staff is great but our last visit with Francisco as our waiter was awesome! He had one of our dishes remade when it came out with mushrooms when the menu didn't say that. He was awesome!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times, love the look and the food is on point. Most dishes range in the $15  price range, but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service. Senior menu available. Try the patio seating during the cooler weather."}
{"text":"I don't normally rate someone  role model however our waiter Erik gave us outstanding service.  I ordered the Mexican pizza which was average. My wife ordered mix and match and she loved it. Her response was its quality ingredients was the best. Will be back with friends. Everyone needs to check it out."}
{"text":"Fiesta Mexicana? Who? Omg loved it! First time here and didn't even know it was here. The habanero hot salsa was AMAZING. Chicken enchilada was so good. My husband had the Carne Asada burrito. Very good. Manager was a complete sweetheart. Definitely a regular place for us now."}
{"text":"Have visited this restaurant many times and have taken our out of town guests here also. We were there Sunday and service was extremely slow. Our server never came back to ask if everything was alright. Luckily another server took over. Drinks were also slow and not consistent. Hostess did nothing to rectify our concerns. Very disappointing. Food is great , but don't know if that's enough for a return visit"}
{"text":"Great food - 5 Stars!!!  Fajitas are great!  Service is awesome.  And the desert options are great!"}
{"text":"Seriously some of the best customer service around. We came in kinda late and the guys were very at tentative and always checking in with us but not like the annoying kind. The food was amazing and the chips and salsa are on point. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Very disappointing.  I would actually give this place a zero but yelp requires at least one star. This place is over priced and under staffed during dinner hours which caused significant delay. The food was warm at best and had to send my son's plate back because it was cold. They corrected the cold chicken fingers by dumping them back into the deep fryer. They were inedible at that point. I'm very excited to see what restaurant will move in next.....it's just a matter of time."}
{"text":"Still so good.  Service better than ever.  Eric is such a good guy.  By far the best crispy chili rellano and Mexican food we have had in Phoenix. Never leave hungry that's for sure.  Coney island rootbeer and sopipillas for dessert is a must.  We'll be back!!! As always service and food are great. Francisco Eric Elizabeth and Melissa just made our night so nice. We feel like family when we come. The crispy chili rellano  are our favorite and of course you have to have a house margarita.  Always have to finish up with a sopapilla yum yum"}
{"text":"I love the look and atmosphere of this restaurant, it was colorful and live music. The chip and salsa was so good and the service was excellent, they kept giving us refills. I got a fajitas,with fish,scallops, and shrimps. It was delicious!! I haven't tasted nothing like this at home in St. Louis."}
{"text":"Very good and very authentic, my wife had cheese enchiladas and I had the chile Colorado, both were excellent.  Salsa was also very good."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Fiesta Mexicana. I went there for lunch, and I was greeted promptly by the host. We got seated immediately! The atmosphere is very welcoming and festive. Since I am from Texas, I'm pretty pick about Mexican food, but this was just like home. I had the deluxe tostada, and it was very yummy. The prices are very fair for the amount of food you get. Their salsa is very good and fresh! Overall a great place!"}
{"text":"Great service and great food!  We are in town from NJ and were looking for authentic Mexican and we found it.  Drinks were yummy too."}
{"text":"Great experience at Fiesta Mexicana! Chips and salsa were so authentic and fresh! Shredded beef tacos and carne asada had great flavoring. Portion sizes were large. Had  great margaritas! The wait staff was awesome! Had several members of the staff, including mgmt, checking on us regularly! Was pleasantly surprised at what a great experience we all had! We will definitely return to our local restaurant! Thanks Fiesta Mexicana!"}
{"text":"Great food and decent pricing. We have been here several times and it's never that busy actually. All of the booze and chairs are custom carved and painted it's so pretty to look at everything in here."}
{"text":"We are moving to this area and really, really wanted a great Mexican place. Think we found it here. We were here on a weekday late lunch and it was pretty empty, which could be a concern.  But driving past another evening, there were plenty of cars in the lot. The salsa has a kick, but not too much.  The food was VERY good. Much better than our soon-to-be-former Ahwatukee place.   Came back for Thursday happy hour - same great food, and they are right about the margaritas. Really starting to love this place."}
{"text":"Service was fabulous. One of the top places for service I've ever experienced. Food was great too."}
{"text":"Very nice establishment. Clean, customer service on que, food was very good. Fresh, hot and tasty. A+...."}
{"text":"Have been here twice. Although the service was great, the meals were very bland (veggie burrito and taco salad). Sorry to say I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Got an email from them after my first complaint but they did nothing after I supplied them w/details.  Still a crappy place to eat since they don't honor their coupons, have the laziest cooks in AZ, and don't know how to manage a restaurant."}
{"text":"We had tried this restaurant twice in the past but had left very disappointed and hungry because the food was inedible.  Several neighbors had told us it was under new management and they had enjoyed their meals.  My husband ordered some type of burrito that was the size of his plate, unfortunately it was cold.  I ordered the beef fajitas and they were very good but shocked that I had to ask for the tortillas??  Our son had the avocado burger and enjoyed it.  Our server was excellent although they did seem to be understaffed having to wait five minutes to be seated..."}
{"text":"This place would be absolutely perfect if It weren't for the bad customer service! The food is great! And prices are reasonable, however you will wait because, they have too few servers.  The restaurant has a very authentic Mexicax feel and its very cold so bring a light sweater.  It always is very kid friendly."}
{"text":"Good food at very decent prices. I've have the green chile and the tacos and both were very good."}
{"text":"This place was gross! My water tasted like a toilet. We ordered a cheese crisp, which was over cooked . The fajitas for two was more like for three ( could have gotten the regular size). I was excited when I first saw them because I was so hungry!! Then, I took a bite and was disgusted! I don't know what spices they use, but it is not good. Who can ruin fajitas? Usually I can tolerate any quality of Mexican food. Just put a little salsa on it and it will be edible. I tried a second bite and wanted to choke! I couldn't eat it. Even my husband thought they were bad but he choked them down. We didn't tell the server because we didn't want to complain. I ate the chips and salsa which was ok. My husbands beer came in a margarita glass. We sat on the patio, we were the only ones there, and it seemed like every five minutes one of the workers was opening the door to look at \" something\" in the back. I don't know if they were worried about us leaving or if they were waiting on a drug run;) The server was nice but slow and forgetful.  Additionally, the food is waaaayyyyyy over priced. You are much better off going to Raul and Theresa's or even filibertos....lol."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped in for a late dinner.. The bus boys were very friendly as well as the server who I believe her name was Alissa?!  She was attentive and welcoming & had great recommendations... Two words HOUSE MARGARITA!!! Woah! That was delicious!  The food was pretty good! Rice and beans could have a little more flavor but who isn't picky with their rice and beans if it's not from their nanas kitchen?!?! The shredded beef was delicious and juicy' so satisfied with my tacos.. I originally had a burrito and taco but took back the burrito because I was disappointed in the sauce and most of all the tortilla.. Store bought. But I loved the tacos!!  We will be returning!  4 stars!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place .25 star that would be too much!! The food was HORRIBLE, the service was HORRIBLE, the management was HORRIBLE! I ordered the deluxe tostada, it came with a soggy, NOT crispy, tostada shell, the meat was chewy and the flavoring was disgusting! When we gave it back to the manager he said he would get it taken care of...30 minutes later...I still had no meal! We finally left!! It was an awful experience! The people next to us even we're talking about how bad the food and service were! Beware!!!!"}
{"text":"Sitting at Fiesta Mexicana...beer and chips and salsa!  Yummy!  Waiting for our food!  Just got it...burritos are awesome!!"}
{"text":"For starters, our server was very sincere and sweet, great service. This was our first time here, she was very helpful and patient. I took the advice of another helper and had the burrito verde. Very good! I'll agree, do try. Got my free sopapilla dessert and it was also very delicious. Hands down, we'll be back soon for sure! Glad we found this place. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Being new to town i'm familiar with the struggle of finding decent mexican food. . Its a little pricier but to me totally worth it! Service is always very attentive always full water and chirp.  We've been in a couple times now and can't wait to go back tonight!"}
{"text":"Had a good time at fiesta mexicana. The enchiladas are very good probably the best in Arizona. Ruben was an awesome waiter. He always has a smile on his face."}
{"text":"Food was delicious! My husband and I went there and had lunch yesterday. Service was friendly and helpful. We had Cactus margaritas for only $3.99 a piece. Cheap! I had the Fiesta Burrito with shredded beef. Awesome, loved it! I had refried and my husband had the whole beans. Really liked the whole beans. The only thing I was not crazy about was the salsa. I do prefer Pico de Gallo and that was delicious. I will definitely be going there again. Restaurant was clean, nicely decorated and had a comfortable feel to it."}
{"text":"We have no intention of returning, we tried it three separate times months apart hoping to see improvement and we didn't.  The first time, we were given a basket of chips upon being seated then no one returned for more then 25 minutes so we left, we never even got a drink order in. The second time we went for appetizers only again the service was lacking and food was not restaurant quality and over priced.  Yesterday was a last and final visit. We were immediately greeted and had our drink order taken and was told chips would be brought to the table, we had to request the chips be brought after about 15 min. For our meal we ordered nachos, kids quesadilla and a beef tostada. When they brought it out we were served a taco salad in place of the tostada, they quickly corrected it by what appeared to be the taco salad being dumped onto a tostada shell. We didn't even eat a third of the food, two of felt sick by the time we left. Save your money it's way over priced for such simple dishes and lacking service."}
{"text":"We were in the area for Spring Training games- so glad we found this place. Nice family friendly restaurant. Great Service. Our waiter was very friendly. Chips and salsa were very good. Everyone in our group enjoyed their dinner. I hadn't realized it was kids eat free night, but the waiter pointed it out to us. We appreciated the good customer service. We will definitely return when we come back to the area."}
{"text":"They spilled our dinner on the floor, only a small amount actually on us, which is the only reason this review is not 4-5 stars. The food is amazing and the staff is friendly and nice, however, if you spill food on your customers then you should at least comp the food that has to be remade. Mistakes happen, but to not even offer to make up for your mistakes is unacceptable and terrible business ethics. Will I eat here again? Probably, unless I find another local spot with better customer service. Very disappointed in this restaurant as our first experience was amazing and tonight's experience was extremely uncomfortable."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the staff most courteous.  I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"The staff were extremely efficient and personable. Our server almost met our needs before we knew we needed it. The food was beautifully presented and delicious! The chicken fajitas seasoning was magical! The little Mexican flag was a festive touch."}
{"text":"Not sure what the rest of the reviews were about but this place is not bad. I have a three item combo it was a lot of food! Te flavors were really good the right things were spicy and some more mild! The service was amazing we had a gold by the name of Perla she was attentive and treated us great!"}
{"text":"I wish I read the reviews before trying this restaurant!   We ventured to the Fulton Ranch Promenade to try this Mexican Restaurant. We never had a chance to try the other restaurants in the same location that seem to stay open less than a year.  My husband and I ordered water with lemons and were disappointed to see that his lemon slice had a large black spot on it, and my lemon slice had several brown spots on them. Yuck, I don't want to squeeze that into my water. Why would you serve this to a customer?  Our server spoke less than five words to us. We understand English is not her primary language. However, she could have been cheerful and welcoming towards us, especially with our small children.  Yes, the chips arrived in hot dog baskets. The busboy was prompt and friendly, however, the chip basket was so small - he could not help but touch the chips with his hands while serving.  The food tasted similar to frozen food entrees I had the pleasure of eating while I was in college....I thought those days were gone.   We look forward to the next restaurant that opens in this location."}
{"text":"Great service, love the food!  Friendly staff always remembers our normal order :)  best place for Mexican food in the West valley."}
{"text":"Food is amazing, normally order the cerviche and a good stir fry, would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"I eat Mexican about 3 times a week and this place has by far the best chips and salsa hands down. The service was excellent and my salsa bowl was refilled three times without me even having to ask. The prices are at the high end of Mexican food but the food was really really good. Def recommend this place to any serious Mexican food fan."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, decor, and hostess. Poorly trained servers and food was only tolerable.  I expected prices to be higher in this location, and they are, but the food quality was lacking.  There's no way the carne asada was marinated before burning it on the charcoal.  Beans were runny and lacked salt.  Chips could have been store bought, thus the extremely small quantity served to the table.  It annoys me that there's \"only one free refill on soda\"; maybe OK for the bar, but for the dining area?"}
{"text":"Large portions expertly repaired. The strawberry margarita was awesome. As was the churro"}
{"text":"This is a great Mexican Restaurant, great food and friendly staff. Food has great flavor for every taste bud."}
{"text":"This place was an all around disappointment.   We were greeted with an empty lobby got to stand and wait for a couple minutes til someone came up and said \"two?\" No personality.   The interior decor is very loud and old school, it  just has a cheap feeling to it.   The menu is the same way, loud, hard to read and jumbled.     Server was extremely bland and really didn't have much knowledge of the menu or Mexican cuisine for that matter.   We had hopes that the food would make up for the downfall in other areas, no such luck  The chips were very bland and cold, the salsa was  freshly made but bland and way over-onioned.   We ordered fajitas, if a restaurant can do great fajitas, we figure the rest of the menu will be great.    No dice, minimal amount of meat, small chunks of overcooked and bland meat made it a huge disappointment.   Can't believe I'm saying this but I'd head to Garcias before I went here.    Quite a disappointment to say the least."}
{"text":"So my family and I had the day off and wanted to spend it together by having a delicious lunch. We were craving some good, flavorful Mexican food. We wanted something close to home, though all the good Mexican restaurants are on the south or east side and we are on the west, we were gonna go to our usual Mexican spot Manuel's. My mom suggested trying a new spot, Fiesta Mexicana, which was just down the street. From the get go, we were pleasantly greeted. The menu was pretty confusing. When we asked the questions we had about the menu to our waiter he said he didn't know either, which was no help. My family loves chips and salsa, so as soon as we were served them, we starting eating them and I was greatly disappointed. Neither the chips nor salsa had flavor. VERY BLAND. But we were so hungry we just ate them anyways. I ordered a beef chimichanga and chicken enchilada. Usually when you order a chimichanga or enchilada, they usually give you a choice of meat & chili (green or red). Here, you're just able to choose the meat. So cutting into my chimichanga I was not expecting any kind of chili but I noticed it was red chili. I'm not a big fan of red chili, I LOVE GREEN CHILI. It was okay but very dry since there was no guacamole nor sour cream on top. It cost extra, very strange considering anywhere you order a chimichanga all of those toppings are included. Since I was not impressed by the chimi, I was looking forward to the enchilada. AGAIN, VERY DISAPPOINTED . Sauce was very bland almost tasted like they had topped it with red colored water. Smh. We finished our drinks fairly quickly and we never got asked for a refill , we shouldn't even have to ask. Overall it was a terrible experience, over priced for food that doesn't match the quality. I could've had a better tasting home made Mexican meal at home. I don't think I'll be returning."}
{"text":"We came to Fiesta Mexicana because Macayo's was closed, and we're so glad we did. The service was good, the chips & salsa were great, and the food was amazing!! My husband got a house margarita, and that was pretty tasty, too. For my family of three to eat, and also the margarita, it was less than $50 before tip. We will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Awesome food with great service. I highly recommend the chicken quesadilla, the best I have ever had. The chips were also great as was the salsa. I also enjoyed the pollo asado and they had good margaritas.  The only reason for not receiving 5 stars was that the hostess appeared to be having a bad day and I witnessed people waiting at the front for a while before being greeted."}
{"text":"The lady who was my server never told me her name in the whole hour and half I was there. She never gave me her recommendations for what is good. I spoke to the young man Huntyr who was the busser and he was extremely helpful with refills and making sure I was ok. This spoke volumes as I hadn't seen muchof the server throughout the evening. I felt bad even tipping the waitress because she hardly did squat.... Food is EXTREMELY OVERPRICED!!!! I got a side of guacamole and they charged me $5!!! Not only that but by the time I got my bill for the meal which was a soda, a plate with carne asada rice, beans and the guacamole it was $24.00!! I couldvetaken my wife out to dinner for almost the same amount...$24 for one person is outrageous.....Great Job Huntyr on the customer service, Poor Job Waitress, Management might want to consider a pricing change....."}
{"text":"Thought we would try the Happy hour after a previous visit proved unremarkable.  Joe our server was very good, but unfortunately no Corona Light on tap (although promoted ), and they ran out of Coors Light on tap. Plus, they claim to have the best margaritas in Chandler, but they are not on the Happy hour menu? ? Still, the ambiance was perfect on the patio,  and it was busy. Happy hour appetizers were decent, but nothing to rave about. Two chances, I think we're done."}
{"text":"The food was okay. Not great or horrible either. Chips and salsa were good and the salsa was pretty spicy for this kind of place. The problem I have is that we came in at lunchtime, had lunch special menus in our hand when ordering, and got charged almost double for not specifying that we wanted the lunch special version. We spoke with a management member and they wouldn't correct it.  So gaining an extra 10 bucks was more important than creating a possible return customer. Well done guys! Forgot to mention that it wasn't real crowded but service was poor. Hire more people as well. Obviously won't return!"}
{"text":"This place is by far the best for mexican food.. Lilly our waittress is the best... I definitly give this place a 5 star..."}
{"text":"Enjoyed everything about coming here, great food, music and atmosphere. Went on a Friday night and the service was top notch."}
{"text":"Disgust is a polite description of our service tonight. Came in for a happy hour special only to be charged happy hour for my beer and not my appetizer. Once this was brought to the servers attention he adamantly stated that we came in after happy hour. Really? But you charged us happy hour price for the beer but NOT the appetizer?  When the error was brought to the servers attention he brushed my husband off and stated he will be with him. He then sent the manager over whom apologized and stated he would rectify the discrepancy by voiding the transaction and recharging us. Ah no! If you can't properly charge us the first time what makes you think we will entrust you to make multiple transactions? I suggested they simply refund us the difference in cash to resolve the issue without the risk of any additional errors. The manager refused and stated this was our only option. No additional offer nothing! No apology from the server! Wow geez great customer service and resolution skills management! Thanks for attempting to redirect your mistake on your customer by making them feel as though they created the error! I will be contacting the owner to make them fully aware that there needs to be some additional training in customer service/problem resolution. They used to be one of my favorite neighborhood restaurants now I've been discouraged from returning."}
{"text":"Thank you to Mario today for great service & to the cooks who made one of the best meals we have had in a really longtime and surprising it was from a \"found\" restaurant that apparently is a chain which was the 2nd biggest surprise. Overall the meal for the 3 of us was very enjoyable. We will be back to try more from the expansive menu which included some favorites which hadn't been seen since I left CA like a talipa whole fried fish to a seafood stuff that rivaled cioppino. We never felt rushed and were given much time to digest the menu's plethora of options and then to actually enjoy our food.  I must add not once did our glasses become half full or close to empty. GREAT service even with a busy restaurant was such a bonus."}
{"text":"Nice bldg and love the  outdoor seating. The food is ok, but the drinks are awful."}
{"text":"This is my second visit to this place.   Both times were well above average.   The service is top notch.   Several employees would asked if I was Ok.   My server was Jose.   He works in the bar area.   Jose kept my soda full.   The food proportions are just right,  and tasty.   This restaurant is fully renovated.   I understand that they have only been open for a few weeks.  I would really recommend stopping by if you are looking for something a little different."}
{"text":"I eat here often. I'm very disappointed today. My wife always orders the Aguachile. Today it was so hot she didn't eat but a few shrimp. I tried to eat some and I couldn't. I get that it's supposed to be hot but its been ordered by us like 13 times before with no issues. That's not the big issue. Even tho that was a waste of money my shrimp cocktail was worse. I know shrimp cocktails. This presentation was good but the size of the shrimp was ridiculous. The rim of the glass had some good size shrimp as presentation. When you scooped the soup it had small nickle sized shrimp. I feel ripped off."}
{"text":"We were seated and sat for ten to fifteen minutes before ever being acknowledged. Server finally came over with menus and chips then tried to walk away without asking if we'd like drinks. No apology for leaving us ignored. If we hadn't had a baby and toddler with us we would have left. Twenty minutes after ordering manager cane to our table to explain that our order had just gone in as the micros had malfunctioned. The bill was comped but service was terrible and food was marginal. We're there at 3:00 in the afternoon, place wasn't busy and found no excuse for being ignored. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"One of our favorite go-to restaurants. We order the chicken fajitas every time and we are not disappointed. The staff is friendly and courteous, the restaurant clean.  You can't ask for better Mexican food in the West Valley/"}
{"text":"Fiesta Mexicana provides very good food and drink for a reasonable cost...a great value. The guacamole is fresh and delicious, margaritas are the best in the area, and the chips and salsa are perfect."}
{"text":"Newbies to Phoenix and the west Valley, found this charming restaurant on Yelp and had to give it a try! I think we have found our regular spot!! Awesome staff, beautiful decor and even more amazing food! I highly recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"I had dinner here last night.  First impression. Chips and salsa made in-house.  The salsa was well-balanced with tomatoes, onion, and chilies.  It was a good medium-spicy variety.   It could be improved with a little fresh cilantro.  The menu includes a huge number of items.  I was going to do my usual test-drive with cheese and beef enchiladas, but then I saw the Chorizo & Egg burrito.  The burrito was massive. It was finished with a light bath of red sauce and covered in meted cheese.  There was a good ratio of Chorizo to egg (are you listening Taco Cabana?).  The rice was surprisingly good.  Only Taco Diner has served me better rice.  The beans were adequately seasoned but not salty.  They were smooth and covered in melted cheese.  Solid meal and I will be back to try some of the house specialties.  My only gripe is that the carpeted floor really needed vacuuming."}
{"text":"Anna was great! She did a nice job of taking care of us. She was friendly and helpful with the menu. I was super happy with her recommendations for the lunch menu.   The food cake quick and it was hot and delicious. We enjoyed our lunch a lot!"}
{"text":"Service was great. Food was great. I had the tamales and my husband had bacon wrapped shrimp. The decor is awesome and vibrant. Would come back again!"}
{"text":"This place was super good! Stopped in on a whim, so glad we did! Try the Chile relleno, it doe not disappoint.  Annette is amazing! Thanks for a great experience!"}
{"text":"Had the combo platter.... Wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. My tamale tasted as if it was frozen, but enchilada and tacos, was tasty. The service was was good, to be fair l will go back and try other items. I would really like to give another star."}
{"text":"This restaurant definitely attempts to put you in the mood for mexican food. The decor is thoroughly mexican and they play nothing but mexican music.  The food is delicious, with a strong tomato flavor in their sauces.  Their taco shells must be made in house because they have a unique taste that I have not found elsewhere. The enchiladas and burritos contain generous portions of shredded beef. The meals are served on large plates and the service is excellent.  Their menu has a great way for customers to order combination plates.  They give you a list of half a dozen or so items and let you choose any three.  I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Big fan of Mexican food, but their food is spiced just a little to much. You can always add but its hard to take away."}
{"text":"This spot has been a few different types of eateries but I think Fiesta Mexicana is here to stay and this diner couldn't be happier!  Whether it's lunch or dinner, weekday or weekend the food and the staff are on point.  Whether you prefer your regular taco, burrito or enchiladas or you have a deeper palate for pastor, carbona, mole sauces or seafood selections you won't be disappointed.  Take the time to venture out west to Avondale and see for yourself."}
{"text":"We just moved into the area and we found this place. We had great service and really enjoyed the atmosphere. I love the colorful seating and tables. Plus it's nice that the environment has lots of energy. The food has been great and we really enjoy the salsa! I recommend checking Fiesta Mexicana out the next time you want Mexican food. It could be your next favorite place."}
{"text":"Love the food here not so much the bartender. He's arrogant and never says \" thanks for coming in\". This really bothers me because we frequent other restaurants in the area and we are treated much differently.  He acts as though we are doing him a favor by stopping in. Total sense of entitlement going on here. I just don't get it. This guy needs a total attitude adjustment. On a good note, the hostess is always friendly. We are greeted upon arriving and always told thanks for coming in on our way out. Management needs to talk to that bartender. I'm sure he's rubbing other customers the same way."}
{"text":"Regular guests, great margarita's, we like the combo platters.  We usually are there during the week and have always been seated promptly.  Wait staff has always been attentive, without being annoying and the manager has come around to thank us for stopping in.   Just wish they had black beans."}
{"text":"Great service. Husband had chicken mole chimichangas, awesome great size and definitely will do next time, I had seafood fajitas, oily and not worth it but will come again ti try something else."}
{"text":"Our first visit was shortly after they opened last October and after waiting 30 minutes for our dinners, we were told that the stove had broke so it would be another 30 minutes for our dinners, we opted to leave. Last week a co-worker said the food was good so we opted to bring some out of town visitors to Fiesta Mexicana for a \"second chance\".  It was EXTREMELY disappointing, we would have thought that by now, they would have worked up the quirks! While the décor is very nice, the service and food quality were quite subpar. Our friends daughter requested \"no beans\" just rice, plate arrived with more beans than rice. Friends wife ordered salad with \"grilled\" shrimp. Shrimp were not grilled, just chilled, no salad dressing. I ordered shrimp in green sauce. Shrimp extremely overcooked (they were hard) and all I could taste in the green sauce was salt. Husband ordered tacos with NO tomatoes, arrived with tomatoes. But the worst part was our friends dinner, chicken wrapped in bacon. The chicken was undercooked and the bacon was raw! This is a serious health hazard. We expressed our concern to the waitress and a \"small\" adjustment was made on the tab. Fiesta Mexicana is the 3rd restaurant to be located in the building (originally Saute) and if this is the quality of food they server, it too will be short lived. The Ocotillo community is very discerning about restaurants and quality, we have a lot of competition in the area for our dining dollar, and this establishment does not deserve a repeat visit. We were embarrassed bringing our out of town guests to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Vary good food vary friendly service  just moved to az second time here will be back again"}
{"text":"Very good mexican restaurant on the west side! Huge portions! Good margaritas with lots of different flavors! Service was a bit slow at first but after we were greeted was great!"}
{"text":"They really don't skimp out on that chicken. Also had the salad bowl. Yum! Great staff. Friendly people.  Love the art here too. Art on every seat"}
{"text":"Breanna was an amazing server tonight very attentive to our needs would go back again simply for the customer service provided by Breanna and not to mention the great food !!!!"}
{"text":"Macayos is elementary to this place.  Authentic Mexican food Is the name and authentic Mexican food is what they serve. That is all."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food & service we've had in a very long time, we will be coming back again"}
{"text":"Loved this place!  The food and service were excellent.  We were very well taken care of.  The menu was outstanding with lots to choose from!  And the decor is beautiful with lots of colors and very authentic. Oh and the margaritas were outstanding."}
{"text":"Out first time tonight. The food was exceptional, but Nancy our server was the star! Awesome service! Queso fundido and tacos al carbon were my favorite. We'll be back for the food, atmosphere, and Nancy"}
{"text":"The food was good, especially the steak and chicken enchiladas. The mariachi's were a plus. the atmosphere and furniture were neat. The waitress friendly. I would go there again. My chicken enchilada was good. The shredded beef burrito just so so."}
{"text":"Literally thee absolute worst mexican restaurant ive ever been to. The salsa tasted like onions and the habanero one was just spice no flavor. I ordered enchiladas and they were a 5/10. The rice was odd it had peas and other stuff in it. The server was horrible. By time she came back with waters we already knew what to order because we were waiting for about 10 minutes. She came to the table a total of 3 time. I couldnt even ask for something different because she came to check on us after we had our food for over 15 minutes. Not to mention the restaurant was nearly empty so its not like she was slammed. Would not go here if I were you"}
{"text":"Large portions of yummy!  Good chips and salsa Great Italian marg! Definitely will come again!"}
{"text":"While there were some cleanliness issues, we enjoyed our food.  Its interesting to read people complain  that the restaurant is not \"Mexican\" enough-that its too Tex Mex.  Well then, you've got a problem because that's most of the Mexican restaurants in Chandler and the area.  Actually, this restaurant had a much more extensive menu than many other restaurants-they have quite a few seafood and shrimp dishes.  I had the Chicken Mole Enchiladas which is not typically found at other Mexican restaurants.  It was pretty good and it was a good size portion.  I have had better chips and they certainly could be more generous with them and I do like getting a both a mild and spicy salsa."}
{"text":"Great service AMAZING food bartender Chris is so friendly and kind!! I love it there it feels like home"}
{"text":"This is our 4th time coming here! The Michiladas are out of this world!! Huge portions and great taste! Next best thing to home cooking!"}
{"text":"The Pros: DAVE!  Our server Dave was fantastic.  Honestly some of the best service I have received in a long time.  I hope I have his name right, I am 85% sure it was Dave...  Anyway, his level of attentiveness was perfect, in addition to his great attitude and ability to anticipate our needs.                    The restaurant....was very nice and clean, all of the staff seems to take pride in what they do and greeted you with a smile.  Bathrooms = very nice and clean, looked brand-new.  Good happy hour deals 7days a week, and it looks like they have live entertainment quite often. Salsa is great, they offer it in three different \"heat\" levels. Chips = good.  The sopapilla(sp?)was excellent.  The Cons:  Although the quality of the food was fine and it was prepared perfectly....the flavor....  It was simply lacking any flavor that stood out..  Portion size was great, it just needs a little more seasoning...or something to kick the flavor up a notch..  And I do NOT mean just add more \"heat\".  Just simply a tad more flavor."}
{"text":"Their salsa had a nice bite . Wasn't crazy about the queso cheese dip, but the steak burrito was very good.  Good service"}
{"text":"Horrible! Only good thing to say is you can't mess up a beer. The food was okay but we didn't eat it because we were so full from eating chips and drinking for an hour and a half while we waited for our server and then for our food. The manager apologized and took some off the bill. But to pay $60 for dinner my family and I didn't eat was no value at all."}
{"text":"Wow. I seldom say that a restaurant was completely sub-par but in this case, yes, this place is awful. It could be terrific too, given the potential of the building and location. We were seated quickly but the hostess and server were not cordial. They have a very atypical advisory on the menu that if you order a soda you get 1 refill only. I ordered carne asada and LITERALLY, could not cut it. Couldn't. It was like beef jerky. And it was just a few sorry looking pieces. When the server came to take plates I told her mine was completely inedible and she just nodded in acknowledgement and walked away with the plate....like, no big deal. Another guy came to bus the table and he never acknowledged our presence, but instead, spent a good 2-3 minutes consolidating plates, pulling tortillas out of warmers and stacking into a single warmer, then stacking the warmers, etc. Total silence, just watching this guy fiddle with dishes and uneaten food for a while, at our table, right in front of us, never saying a word. AWKWARD. Complete waste of money."}
{"text":"I loved this place. The food was amazing. The portion sizes are out of this world. You get what you pay for at this restaurant and then some. I also ordered a drink here and it was also massive. The only minor complaint I have is that they didn't list the drink prices on their drink menu. My drink was delicious but I would have liked to know the price going in. That being said this my favorite Mexican food place on this side of the valley."}
{"text":"I just ate a damn good taco and had a damn good margarita. And our server was the bees knees! No complaints."}
{"text":"Excellent service, great food helped promptly. It's our 2nd time here friendly staff and great atmosphere been to a lot of Mexican restaurants this one is on the top of my list! A+ highly recommended"}
{"text":"It was my first time to eat in this restaurant. I ordered frozen Mango Margarita and while sipping it I found a piece of glass inside my mouth which I thought at first , a crushed ice. I showed it to the waitress which in turn, she showed it to the manager Pedro Sanchez who admitted in the presence of Eric H ., an employee at Fiesta Mexicana. Not a safe place to eat ! I would not recommend it."}
{"text":"Came in on a Friday night - not busy and seated right away by the friendly hostess.  The decor was colorful and festive - just how I imagine a Mexican restaurant to be!  But this place was clean, the furniture was maintained and it looked like they took the time to decorate!  They also had a mariachi!  You receive free chips and salsa.  They have a lot on their menu and we ordered a Dinner for 2 option (don't remember what it was called) but it was good and fulfilling.    Don't forget to check-in to receive your free offer - I think it was a free desert - churro maybe?   :)"}
{"text":"Enjoyed dinner with the family listening to Kristy Dee! Great family atmosphere and wonderful tasting food!"}
{"text":"Great service, interesting menu, awesome happy hour. I love the beautiful patio and atmosphere.  The salsa is very fresh and good. Portions are large on both good and drinks.  I got the crispy chile rellanos recommended in another Yelp review. It was wrapped in a won ton shell.  Beans are good. Everything is fresh and opulent if slightly bland."}
{"text":"Always a good meal!  I have tried everything on their menu and still can't decide which one is my favorite.  Awesome drinks, the bar tender knows their stuff.   Top: Mariachi band is awesome though they can get a little loud.  Just let the host know you want to sit on the outer table if you want to robe it down."}
{"text":"Based on the previous reviews I would not come here.  But, I'm adventurous so I'll try it anyway how bad could it be.  Service:  above average Cleanliness:  perfect (new place so expected) Devour: combo appetizer (pica (shredded beef) nachos, chicken quesadilla, chicken Taquitos), enchiladas combo and a single pescado taco  Quality: first off the salsa is delish.  It has a texture and about a medium spice.  The combo platter was huge, everything was great.  The best thing that stood out was the taco.  By far the best fish taco I've had in a very long time.  I'm getting a fish taco combo next visit.    I will definitely return."}
{"text":"I got the chicken enchilada and it was very good!  The food was on our table after around 5 minutes of ordering, and the servers were nice."}
{"text":"10/10 definitely recommend! Authentic Mexican food right down to the chips and salsa! Great service, great atmosphere! My all time favorite Mexican food!"}
{"text":"unfortunately I have to agree with the reviews.  I also was excited about having Mexican food near Sun Lakes.  I enjoy a good margarita and good food.  We visited for the first time around 4 o'clock and the place was empty so we had great service.  I just can't rave about the food and not sure if I will return.  I judge Mexican food by their salsa & chips and beans.  The salsa was okay and chips were probably store bought.  Beans. Had a good texture but needed salt.  I definitely agree that the food is over priced.  For a simple menu it should not be that expensive.  I was disappointed that soup is not on the menu.  I ordered chicken enchiladas green chili and it was good. I hope their management is reading the reviews and improves their food and prices or sadly it won't last.  This location seems to have a curse on it.  Restaurants are not successful here.  Very sad."}
{"text":"Everything was amazing!!! Could not say enough good things about it!!! I had the tostadas and my husband had the lunch combo with a tamale and a chimichanga. Everything was delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday night with some colleagues. The restaurant wasn't very busy. First thing we did was order two of their Don Julio margaritas. After about 10 minutes we had not received our margaritas. I walked over the bar and there was no bartender. I flagged down a random server and asked for a bartender, she said the manager is tending the bar tonight. 2 to 3 minutes later somebody comes over and asks what can I do for you, and I said, we ordered margaritas but we haven't got them yet. Clearly no one is making them. With no explanation or apology he said he will make them right now. They seem to not care how poor their customer service was. It's as if they believed this was an acceptable level of service. Oh, and the food was decent but definitely overpriced."}
{"text":"First time here, the place is charming, has a nice patio, but a little over the top with Stereotypical decor.   There wasn't a hostess, only one waitress and one busboy.  Mid-week in summer so not too surprised at the limited staff.  HOWEVER, very long wait, never got waters after many requests, couldn't remember our order, never came back to get a fresh drink, mediocre food, expensive for value.  We will try again 'in season' but not in a hurry to go back."}
{"text":"This was just okay.  I had a tostada which was decent, but nothing special.  However, the service at this place was very very slow and they weren't even busy.  For an area so rich with many great Mexican restaurants, I would skip this one."}
{"text":"Thanks to our fantastic server Whitney ! She was fast, fun, and helpful! The food was great, and the chips and salsa were one of a kind!"}
{"text":"This has to be my 20th visit since they opened. My most favorite Mexican restaurant in Arizona! I especially LOVE the Chili Colorado plate and I pretty much get the same thing every time. The meat is full of flavor and tender. When it comes to appetizers, the cheese crisp is so yummy and they have the most delicious piled high nachos. The portions are incredible. I love the chips & salsa. They have 3 different salsa's regular, medium and hot. The service is friendly & prompt. Overall, I love the friendly service and you can always count on delicious affordable Mexican food every time you visit."}
{"text":"Started with chips and salsa that were great.  Moved on to fantastic margaritas.  The atmosphere and service was fun.  The Chili Verde hit the spot.  Great experience.  Plus tonight the Corona girl was there giving free Coronas and swag.  Bonus!"}
{"text":"Excellent cheese enchilada dinner with rice and beans. Nice patio that has a bar outside. The atmosphere was nice and the restaurant was clean. The servers were friendly."}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favorite Mexican restaurants! Excellent authentic Mexican cuisine. I highly recommend pairing your order with a refreshing coronarita."}
{"text":"First time to visit this restaurant.  Wasn't sure what to order since I don't go to Mexican Restaurants often.  I am Hispanic and would rather eat home cooked Mexican food.  The food was not very flavorful. I had the chili Colorado plate.  The chili tasted sweet not spicy.  Then after we left thought about the price.  We (2 people) had a bill of $44.00  and one of us had water to drink.  Called them to let them know we were over charged and we were told that all they could do was give us a credit for the next meal or a gift card.  I don't want to go back, I want my money back.  I can't believe that I can't get a refund for the over charged amount even though I paid my part in \"Cash\".."}
{"text":"Great service.. sodas nice and sweet not flat or uncarbonated.... beers nice n cold.... fajitas are delicious!!... HUGE PLATES so price is not bad"}
{"text":"I first had Fiesta Mexicana when work ordered it in. I was so impressed with how every item - even the salsa - tasted so good that I took my wife for supper there. I've been several times since and have enjoyed each time.   The most recent visit was the best, and that was due to the super friendly, super efficient Cassy. Oh, and the amazing fried ice cream she made us.  Once again, every item was so flavorful. From the bits of charred peppers in the salsa to the superior enchilada sauce, every bite was to be savored. And the delicious fried ice cream was also the biggest portion I'd ever seen!"}
{"text":"Absolutely one of the most delicious Mexican restaurant that we have been to. We ordered drinks that were also really good! We sat at the bar area & they were just so nice and accommodating!!! My fiancé had the combo platter with a chimichanga, enchilada and taco. I had the combo with crunchy chille. Both plates were delicious!"}
{"text":"I'm not impressed. The cheese crisp was good. Everything else was bland and bad. My wife's dinner was ice cold food on a hot plate. How does that even happen? When she sent it back to have it heated up they remade it which meant we sat around way longer than anyone ever should. The chicken stuffed with shrimp wrapped in bacon with a mushroom sauce on my plate sounds way better than it actually is. It was dry and tasteless and boring. My son had enchiladas that weren't really enchiladas but just tortillas stuffed with some meat with enchilada sauce poured over top. My son's sixteen year old goddaughter said her bean burrito was good, but I'm discounting her input because she stole most of my cheese crisp and her idea of great Mexican food is bean burritos and cheese crisps.   I assumed this was Americanized Mexican food so I wasn't assuming much and so it is particularly disappointing that it was so very mediocre. That said, I have a new working theory. If you have to have pictures of the food on your menu, your food is probably pretty bad.   Oh, and the service was slow, too.  And $80.00 is a lot to pay for lousy food."}
{"text":"We went on Friday to celebrate a friend's birthday.  Our friend had been there before and really liked it but after this visit I doubt she will be back. We had called days before to make a reservation for our large party and were told they do not take reservations. They told us the wait would be about 30-40 minutes. We waited well over an hour and while we waited we saw another large party get seated before us. The hostess was rude and so was the rest of the staff. Finally after a few members of our party left we got seated at a table that did not have enough room for our group. We told the waiter we didn't have enough chairs and he told us he didn't know what to do about it, then he asked us what we wanted to drink. Really? Worst experience I've ever had."}
{"text":"Went back again for dinner on Saturday night during prime time. The place was packed and I thought we were going to be in for a huge wait, however, we were sat immediately and service was faster than expected for how busy the place was. Food was great, even better than the first time so we enjoyed it even more.  This is our new favorite Mexican food place."}
{"text":"Love the food. Service is normally slower, but great overall. The fiesta Grande is my favorite. A little more expensive than traditional Mexican food restaurants, but fresh chips and salsa  and it's fine."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for some Mexican food. I didn't want fast food but I wanted a sit down meal. The place wasn't busy and we got seated right away. The service was great but the seats we had was looking right into the kitchen. They could put something up on the door way so you don't really see what they do the food... Plenty of chips and salsa, and most of the benches were carved. It gave you a nice feeling. The food was good and I left with a full belly. Not to sure I go to this place again because it is out of my way."}
{"text":"If colorful Mexican culture and imagery were a person, this person walked into Fiesta Mexicana and exploded on everything.  The tables, chairs booths, Inca and horse statutes are all very colorful and they're everywhere.  I can imagine Gordon Ramsey visiting and saying \"Bloody Hell, I need shades\".  All fun aside we were greeted quickly and a waiter visited our table for a drink order promptly.  We took advantage of a coupon we got in what most people call the junk mail (money mailer I think).  The coupon was for one combo plate, get the second combo plate free which sounded like a good deal.  I ordered a chicken taco with flauta and my date for the evening ordered a taco with enchilada.  Initially the server brought the wrong soft drink but realized it and corrected it before I even took a sip.  The food arrived hot, she like the fresh and light tasting rice and I thought the beans were home made.  When it came to the fried taco, and flauta we both agreed the chicken was good but didn't have much flavor almost liked it was cooked well and we tried it before the chef seasoned it.  I made the comment that it felt one seasoning or ingredient away from being really good. (A little added salsa from the chips/salsa helped).  Overall for the amount of food with the coupon it was a good deal despite the need for more seasoning.  And the decor kept you looking around the restaurant.  I found most of the people depicted were smiling and pleasant except then imagine of the woman on our table.... maybe she knew about the need for seasoning."}
{"text":"Food is delicious....customer service is friendly and attentive...beers are cold...we will be back"}
{"text":"Went to the restaurant to celebrate my son's birthday. Food and service were great."}
{"text":"Walking inside this restaurant you'll notice all the beautiful artwork on the tables and chairs and walls. When we sat down we were greeted by our server Ariel, he was very friendly and attentive. He gave us warm tortilla chips and salsa that was super delicious.Looking at the menu it was hard to decide what to try because it was our first time there at this restaurant. I ordered the super enchilada combo with shredded beef. The shredded beef was tender and seasoned perfectly and it came with a side of rice,beans,sour cream and guacamole. The plates are large so come with an appetite. Everything taste like authentic Mexican food. Everything we ordered was fresh and perfectly seasoned.I also would like to recognize the service we got from Ariel was outstanding. He Is somebody I would recommend as your server. He checked on us through our entire meal made sure our experience was just as good as the food.If you like spicy salsa I recommend that you ask for the habanero salsa it was hot but super flavorful."}
{"text":"If your looking to eat chips and have a margarita your good to go but if your wanting a meal you better go somewhere else cause it taste horrible!"}
{"text":"This place was great! I loved the atmosphere, the chairs decorated all different, and the bright colors. We all went out for lunch, the waitress new we were on a time crunch and brought our food in a timely manner. The margaritas where pretty good and not to strong. I got the enchilada suiza I believe that's how it's spelled I don't know and it came with beans and rice, it was so good! I didn't know if it was because I didn't eat breakfast or what but it was filling, but I didn't feel stuffed and it didn't feel heavy like Mexican food tends to do. Overall I would come back."}
{"text":"I don't know why this restaurant only has 3.5 stars. It was some of the most delicious Mexican I've had in awhile. I had a combo with the crispy chile rellano and a beef taco. It was outstanding. The atmosphere was great and the service was awesome!  If I'm ever back in Chandler, I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Reasonably priced. Food is good, not great. Service seems slow at times.... But overall pleasant experience."}
{"text":"So yummy!  Came here for lunch (about 2p) yesterday & had a combo plate (shredded beef enchilada, chimi, taco with rice and beans), and the chicken bacon wrapped plate (it had shrimp inside too).  Dessert was a sopapilla.  Everything was very tasty and fresh.  The portions were generous and price was fair.  $13 for my plate & $18 for husband's chicken/bacon/shrimp.    The only negative about this place was the bathroom needed cleaning ASAP."}
{"text":"Always amazing flavorful dishes. Staff as awesome. We always come in with large parties & they are very accommodating. Few of my favorites, crispy relleno, the pescado!!!, El chilpolte steak, idk what they call it but the shrimp in the green chilies had my husband crying because the spice was intense but delicious.  Don't forget to ask for the cinnamon chips for dessert!"}
{"text":"the margarita was AMAZING AND BIG!!!!! The hostess brought my daughter a balloon was so sweet. The meal was so good! I have the super burritos! And oh my the salsa was awesome! I'll be going back!"}
{"text":"Meh, the decor was nice.   We arrived 20 mins before happy hour ended at 7pm, we took advantage of our 5 mins remaining when sat. We sipped our discount dos equis while eating what tasted like store bought (restaurant store) Pico de Gallo mixed with chipotle paste from a can, like the we use for chipotle chicken. We decided to get tacos al pastor (beef) and tacos al carbon (beef) just to taste the difference. This ended up being a clearer taste of salt from the pastor. Our food came our on some huge plates which were pretty cool. However, they served both taco plates with an enchilada sauce that bore a distinct can taste. Next the rice, oh the rice. Can restaurants just not have a microwaves? The rice was similar to what came out of a bag of Uncle Bens bag after too long in the microwave. It was tasteless and looked like plastic with a texture to match. On to the Rositas canned beans! I only make the comparison because we had em the next morning on our egg burros. Yes, the Rositas canned beans were good, but not what I expected from this place. We did recieve free dessert, your choice of microwave churros (3 minis) topped with a mountain of whipped cream and caramel? Maybe carmel? You can also opt for a free sopapilla, not spelled right, when you check in. How can you mess up a churro? Microwave. Tough and chewy are not what makes a good churro. For all this I am sorely disappointed in a place that has 'Authentic' mexican food posted outside. Take it with a grain of salt, from the tacos al pastor."}
{"text":"The food here is really good and authentic. We really enjoy coming here when we are not sure what we want to eat. Can't go wrong here. Plus they treated me to a Mariachi Sombrero and a free desert for my Birthday."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a lot of potential, but hasn't quite figured out the Phoenix market is different than, say, Colorado.  On the plus side, I think the salsa and chips are excellent - a very nice hot sauce with just enough \"bite\".  I also found the Mexican rice to be outstanding.  I had a combo platter with a cheese enchilada and bean tostada.  The cheese enchilada didn't have any onions inside, or any sauce on top - that would be easy for management to fix - offer cheese enchiladas with or without onion, and with or without sauce.  The bean tostada was pretty bland.  The other thing to note is the prices are just a bit too high for this market.  I did enjoy the live Mariachi band.  Oh, and Happy Hour doesn't include Friday or Saturday night, and is only available at the bar or on the patio.  I think Happy Hour should be every day!"}
{"text":"We are visiting and family members that live here brought us here.  The food was EXCELLENT!!!  My mom and I shared a pina colada and the shrimp/chicken fajitas.  They were soooo good!!  We also had the sopapilla and deep fried ice cream.  DELISH!!  Gustavo was our server.  Sweet guy!"}
{"text":"Our first time and we enjoyed it. Had chicken fajitas and chili verde. Nice help and nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"So disappointing. We paid $85 and waited 45 minutes for a meal that wasn't even worth the price or the time. Not to mention they forgot to give us the 2 sides of rice we paid for and the avocados that were supposed to go with the tortilla soup. The food is not that good. I feel like they have to compensate for the loss of business because they're food isn't that great by upping the price of their product. Let me tell you it is definitely not worth it.  I tried getting this resolved with the manager about my experience and how we didn't even get everything we paid for. She could do nothing but replace the rice and avocado. Ok, like I want to waste even more time to drive back and pick up your overpriced rice? I let her know that at the time of pickup the bags were tied and at that point my husband just wanted to leave after waiting 45 minutes. So there was no checking to make sure everything was there. So this is my loss and a learning experience. Let me spare you the time and the money, don't go here if you care for quality food and service."}
{"text":"It's a chill spot and they serve chips.  I'm still searching for that one dish here, that wow dish. Till then I'll get full on chips n salsa."}
{"text":"Fiesta Mexicana  had the best service in the west valley. The food is great as well!  Thank you Fernando for the great service!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and very friendly service. The food was great. The free desert for checking in with Yelp was very nice."}
{"text":"Was just there Sunday afternoon for my second visit.  First time was solo, this time with my wife.  Had a combination plate both times.  All food was hot fresh and tasty.  Salsa had a good bit of heat, just the way I like it.  If I had to come up with a negative, it would be that the chimi's weren't real crispy. Service was attentive both times.  Bartenders see very friendly.  I'm not a Marguerite drinker but ran into a friend there who swears they have the best. Really nice patio seating area."}
{"text":"I never had true Mexican food before and coming from Pittsburgh I'm enjoying my experience so far"}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Great food and great service. We come here all the time. Salsa is fresh and delicious,  my boyfriend gets the tacos al carbon and I try something new each time-not disappointed ever."}
{"text":"The staff is beyond friendly! Sabina babysat 5 kids? Awesome service, excellent margaritas, and great food."}
{"text":"Good food, shady service. We were there during happy hour and asked if we could get the HH margarita made \"skinny\" and the waiter said sure. We ordered 2 and when the bill came we were charged $25 for 2 drinks! The waiter said it was an upcharge to make them w/ fresh lime juice and they used organic tequila. He didn't tell us any of that upon ordering, we thought we were getting HH prices. We asked to see the manager and he tooks a few bucks off...really? Maybe they just don't like gringos, IDK."}
{"text":"First timers here and was pleasantly surprised as we walked into the interior with my wife and was impressed with the 'Mexico' type style with arched walkways, etc. It is a fairly large restaurant divided into 3 sections with both tables and booths.  We were greeted and quickly seated and a waitress walked by and greeted us as well.  The menu is very extensive and was a little intimidating but there was a smaller one inserted for lunch specials which we ordered from.  The waiter was quick to the table and took our drink orders and the salsa and chips were delivered quickly. Our waiter was not particularly personable but he was efficient and courteous.    I had the Chili Colorado and it gets a five star in both taste and amount. I did not think the refried  beans and rice were unique but were fine. My wife liked her salad bowl with chicken, avocado, etc.  but was not overly impressed but did say she would like to return but would order something else.      The only questionable thing I noticed after we had paid and left was the price of the Dos Equis I ordered which showed on the bill as $5.20!!  But, my wife had gotten an ice tea and it did not show on the bill so not sure if that was a combo price of both drinks or they left off her drink and the bottle beer really was $5.20. Would probably be a good thing to ask!! There was also plenty of parking as it is in a small shopping mall area. The price for lunch was $8.99 for both entrees.      Overall, we will be back and enjoyed the atmosphere and food."}
{"text":"We have been coming here since they opened and really enjoy the food and wait staff. In fact, Cathy greets us like best friends when we come through the door. She is disappointed when we don't bring the kids! Real comfort food!"}
{"text":"Love the habanero salsa!! If you like hot and spicy, you have to try it...but I'm warning you, it gets hotter as you keep eating it! If interested, you have to ask for it (no extra charge)...otherwise you will just get the not spicy at all tomato salsa. LILLY Is my favorite server!! She takes super great care of us every time we go!,"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food, tasty margaritas! I had the peach and my friend had the raspberry and they were fantastic! Service was good, server Trevor was prompt (although unamused with our jokes). I had beef fajitas and they came out sizzling, cooked to perfection as far as the beef goes. The peppers and onions were a little too cooked for my taste but still tasted good. Chicken taquitos were great too! No room for dessert this time, just a second round of margaritas! We sat on the patio which was lovely but the inside is fully decorated and looks amazing! So many colors and beautiful pictures from the walls to the booths to the tables and even the chairs! Overall great ambiance and good quality for the price. (Clean bathrooms too which is always good!)"}
{"text":"We wanted to like this restaurant... the food was forgettable. There was almost no taste to anything. The decor is lively and the staff was pleasant. I do not see us good back there."}
{"text":"Beautiful place, very well decorated! The food is fresh and tasty. I love how family friendly and cozy this place is. It's a perfect place for Mexican comfort food."}
{"text":"The food was very good and authentic, service was good, and the place has a nice atmosphere, I recommend this place if your looking for yummy Mexican food."}
{"text":"All I really want at this point from this restaurant is a mojito!  I have been here FOUR times and asked for a mojito each time and have been told each time that they did not have the \"ingredients\" (fresh mint).  Why on earth is it on your menu if you don't keep ingredients on hand (4 times!)?!  Their fajitas are wonderful and service is great, but please either fix your menu or give me a freaking mojito!!"}
{"text":"We have always had great service.  Read several negative reviews, so I feel sorry for you.  My problem is their food is ODD!   I don't like meat mangled to the point it is unrecognizable.  And shame on me, but I don't like skirt steak - too fatty and funky tasting.  So my choices are frozen, farm-raised, slave-labor processed shrimp or chicken.  There are very few chicken dishes that are not mooshed up with an odd-tasting sauce mixed in.  The ground beef tastes like Taco Bell meat.  Ordered Arroz con Pollo today.  How hard can that be?  Rice, chicken, a few vegetables, right?  Their version has rice on the side with the chicken, mushrooms, onions and \"vegetables\" in a weird red sauce.  All in all, this is the nastiest Mexican food I have had in Phoenix, and I've had some bad stuff!!  Cute decor, loud music, good drinks.  And if you like mooshed up meat, you're in luck."}
{"text":"Good baja-style Mexican food. Me and my family have had everything here from the seafood to the fajitas everything is freshly prepared and the food is always great . prices are a little high but the restaurant is very quaint and pleasant with beautiful paintings and decor. Staff is very respectful to everyone especially to the elderly who consistently get discounts. This is one of my favorite Baja Style restaurants in Arizona."}
{"text":"If you want Authentic Mexican food with an extensive menu. Then this is your place. If your looking for run of the mill Mexican food catering to bland pallets then move along."}
{"text":"Amazing authentic Mexican food, we were super excited to try this place out and it really is amazing"}
{"text":"This place has good food , but when they change my chefs the food taste a littel different sometime lots of flavor and sometime just to plain.  Today was plain but I still come all the time . Free chips and salsa. Service is always great we had a great waiter today."}
{"text":"Surroundings were very festive, but the music was blaring. I ordered one shredded beef taco with rice & beans, my friend ordered a cheese enchilada. I was served a hamburger taco in a pre-made taco shell (the kind out of a box) with the smallest serving of rice & beans I have ever gotten at a Mexican restaurant. My friend was served the same exact thing. She did not send hers back, but I did (If I am going to eat a hamburger taco, I will make it at home, NOT pay $9.95!). I could swear the waiter rolled his eyes as he picked up my plate. I will never go back here again, and I usually will give a place a second shot. Do yourself a favor, if you want a delicious Mexican food meal, go to Nando's or Manuel's!"}
{"text":"Great food that has pretty big portions as well.  I've had nothing but great service here and it's always clean  I like the flavor of their house salsa and I love how spicy their hot salsa is."}
{"text":"My family and I ate here for the first time the other night. It was busy but not so busy that we had to wait for a seat. Once seated though it took awhile to get our drink order taken. Are waiter was very friendly and did his job well but with that being said it took a very long time for our food to arrive and the food was good. Not the best I've ever had and not the worst. It's kind of pricey compared to similar restaurants. Over all it was an okay experience."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE. Went with my grandparents nice ambiance and not bad staff but my papa order a taco salad that ended up having an inch of water in the bottom \"from the lettuce\" but the manager made no move to comp the meal. My carne asada was a few millimeters thick (looked like beef jerky) and burnt and tasted like ash even though I ordered medium rare. There was one helpful personal bus girl who talked to us more than our server but definitely won't be coming back"}
{"text":"We've been several times now and have been very pleased each time.  They have some typical \"American\" Mexican food, some Sonoran and some other unique Mexican dishes from other regions which all have been well received by us and our co-diners.  It is a little noisy and the A/C can be a little fickle if you are right under a vent (but hey with AZ, i'd rather have cold A/C vs. none)"}
{"text":"Food is SOO good and it was fast friendly service.   I loved it! I am most certainly coming back again!!"}
{"text":"The best Mexican place I've ever had, surprisingly, is in Kentucky.  This place is a very, very close second.  I've only ever had to wait for a table one time.  The salsa is amazing, and they actually have two salsas.  If you want something a little hotter, ask for the spicy salsa.    Every dish I've ever gotten here is delicious.  The food always arrives hot and exactly as ordered.  And the food comes out very quickly.  The assistant store manager, I can't remember his name, is there almost every day.  He's a tall blonde guy.  He's wonderful.  Sometimes we won't go for a month, and he still remembers my exact order!    This place is a little bit on the pricey side, but you get massive portions of everything.  I can almost never finish my whole meal it's so much food.  The only complaint I have about this place is the new mariachi band.  I just think it's too loud for my particular preferences.  If you want good, authentic Mexican food in west Phoenix with good prices, and excellent service, look no further."}
{"text":"My inlaws made a mistake and put $80 on the tip line on the check. He called credit card company. Company said that the employees of restaurant did the right thing and did the appropriate tip"}
{"text":"I keep coming back to this place again and again and again. I find it to be one of the best Mexican restaurant on the west side. I love their tacos Pastor highly recommend them. They also offer a free dessert to check in on yelp."}
{"text":"This is some great Mexican food! Never had anything I didn't like. Consistently great!"}
{"text":"Delicious salsa and great food. Huge portions. The staff genuinely cares about the restaurant. Never rushed. Mariachis are a great add!"}
{"text":"I ate here for lunch one time. Very authentic Mexican food. It wad decent but kind of pricy. Sometimes when you want decent food you have to pay a little more. I would go a second time. PS. Shrimp cocktail is awesome."}
{"text":"Wow awesome Mexican food in a fabulously decorated restaurant with a fantastic wait staff. We ordered our food and within 8 minutes we already had our delicious food! Highly recommend this place to everyone! This is a must visit if your in the area !"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise. Our first visit to the Fiesta Mexicana was not disappointing. I can't express how surprised we were to find this local gem. We had the opportunity to try their lunch menu which was perfect for us. Ordering the Carna Asada was absolutely delicious with such tender skirt steak. The tortillas were thick, fresh as they could be and so tasty. Their Spanish rice included peas, carrots and corn which was wonderful. Refried beans had a wonderful taste as well. Absolutely love the décor and Mario our server was just as friendly as he could be welcoming us to our very first visit. He made certain we were well taken care of. We have found our new favorite Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Wonderful service, great selections, all have been wonderful!  Recommended to everyone! I'd bring my grandkids here!"}
{"text":"Very yummy chicken chimi, The rice and beans are excellent! Service is very fast and good came out quick! Chips are a little on the heavy side but salsa is perfect! Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Cathy is a great server. We had a lovely meal this evening. We really enjoy coming here."}
{"text":"That's right it jumped a star. The food is great and prices are good. But the service wins it for me I have never had a bad experience here. The west side has good Mexican food and this place is right at the top."}
{"text":"After we sat down at the bar, we noticed that while our seating area had been wiped down, it was filthy. Strike one. During happy hour, the bar seating was about 1/3 full yet we had to ask the disinterested bartender 3 times for drink service. Strike two. The spicy salsa was very good, as well as the chips. Even thought Fiesta is in the neighborhood, we won't be back until we hear of significant improvement in the service. We left after our 1 drink to find good service."}
{"text":"Love the Chicken a la Tampiqueña! Also the micheladas, everything was delicious and will definitely be returning soon"}
{"text":"The restaurant is noticeably clean, and has a bright and beautifully colored decor.  The staff is pleasant, organized, and works together very well.  Service is superb.   As far as the food...  Outstanding!  Their menu selection is diverse, providing something for everyone.  Their chips and salsa is excellent, and the portion sizes of their drinks, food, and desserts are all on the large size.  I left here stuffed, and I'm already thinking about my next visit back."}
{"text":"Dinner and fried ice cream was delicious like always! And we had awesome service thanks to our server Tino!"}
{"text":"I usually don't have time for lunch, but today I am lucky enough to be able to revisit my favorite neighborhood Mexican restaurant. I must be getting older. I took advantage of the Senior menu. I ordered the Senior Chimichanga.With the rice and beans and the delicious chips  and salsa,it was more than enough for $7.99. Great as always."}
{"text":"Here on a Sunday, plenty of guests. Excellent food and customer service.   Eric was our waiter. He is awesome."}
{"text":"It's average Mexican food. Not great, not awful. Salsa and chips were decent. The waiter was really nice. Food is a little overpriced. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Very good Mexican food.  My husband had the Mexican pizza.  He said it was amazing.  I had the arroz con pollo creama. Very good as well.  Margarita was delicious.  Great service too.  The restaurant has an authentic Mexican decor."}
{"text":"As all the reviews show the chips and salsa are on point. Absolutley perfect flavoring.  Our waitress was patient and helpful when we needed her.  The atmosphere is very festive and the music isn't overpowering like some places.  Food was excellent. The entire family was beyond pleased with this place. The salsa can be bought by the pint for 4.90 so that was an amazing bonus. They offer military discount as well."}
{"text":"Completely adequate Mexican standards in a clean, festive environment.  Portions are large and the food (I had the chicken mole) is sufficiently tasty.   Just know you're coming here probably b/c you don't have any better ideas or don't feel like driving a longer distance to something that's going to be more delicious.  The food's fine and it will get you out of the house.  As long as you aren't look for more -- and sometimes that fits the bill -- this spot is a fine choice."}
{"text":"Wonderful service and a very attentive staff. Wonderful food for all 6 people in our family. Great atmosphere!. I will be back for sure. Even my 7 year old son loved his chicken fingers and French fries and shared with everyone so we could see how good they are too."}
{"text":"Sorry but food was not good! No flavor. Salsa not good. The only thing that was good was my Pepsi. Cheese was chunky and excessive and not good. Wont be back. Paid 17 dollars for fajitas with only 5 pieces of tough meat."}
{"text":"We have been talking about checking this place out for awhile and we finally had a chance to try it! I love pollo con crema and few places make it so was excited to try it! Not the best I have ever had but not bad, price on the other hand was a bit on the high side, in fact for Mexican Food everything was high, but portions were a bit bigger. My hubby enjoyed the crispy rellanos, but again pricey. Not many people were there , so we figured the high prices must be the reason. I don't know if we will return because of that, just not that special to overpay.    Well went today the chips and salsa was good, service was good, but the food was terrible, we each had 2 different items, burrito, enchilada, chili rellano and chimichanga and all were not good, the ground beef in burrito had mushy carrots in it, yuck. I could not eat it, I think this is the worse Mexican food I have ever had, and believe me when I say I have eaten a lot and even make it myself. I'm no Mexican cook but I have made better than I had today, chimichangas are crunchy, it was not, soggy on the bottom. I guess this was our last visit, we came at lunch today, last time was for dinner, I'd give lunch a one star or a no star!"}
{"text":"We live nearby and eat here 1 or 2 times per month. We usually find it enjoyable. Went there last night and not surprisingly with summer in full force, there were few other customers. Nevertheless our server managed to find other things to do besides take care of us. She had a bit of an attitude also....not what we usually get here. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Best to go for Taco Tuesday, $2.00 tacos, AMAZING. Also best margaritas, has a lot of alcohol but without being too much, plus they come with an extra shot :) Finally the staff is fantastic, super nice and caring."}
{"text":"This place comes highly recommended and lives up to its reputation. The portion sizes are adequate, but I'd rather have quality than an over abundance of quantity. We split the chicken and shrimp fajita which was enough for four flour tortillas. The chicken was marinated and grilled vs just grilled that you see in most restaurant fajitas. The price is moderate. The margaritas are excellent. The free salsa and fresh baked tortilla chips are better than your average Mexican restaurant. Service is friendly, efficient, and team-like - I felt like we had two bartenders and two servers making sure we were ok. It was slower lunchtime, so I don't know if it's always like that, but we appreciated it! I would definitely recommend it and hope to return soon!"}
{"text":"My wife cooks the best Mexican food, but this place has authentic Mexican food not found at other chain restaurants. Service is excellent, wait time never horrible, and again the food is the very best on the West side of town, and there is tons of competition. This place is a special treat."}
{"text":"Stopped in after months of driving by. I can't believe I've been missing out this whole time!! Chips and salsa were good (I consider myself a salsa snob); the main course arrived hot and was appealing to the eye. The staff from the hostess who took us to our table, the bussers, and wait staff (Bella) were all very attentive. I had the carnitas de pollo which was a first for me, but I'll definitely have it again. This place is a keeper!"}
{"text":"This was my first time going to this restaurant.  It is pretty easy to get to with plenty of parking and pretty cool Hispanic decorations. It was fairly busy and they had several large groups seated. It was not overwhelmingly crowded.  They have a very very large menu, but they were fairly nasty dirty.  It made me want to use a Clorox wipe to clean them.  The people were friendly, not very pushy with the \"hurry up and order so we can get you out of here\" attitude.  Although,  we kept running out of chips and salsa because our order took forever to come out. (Remember several large groups were there st the same time)  we were told updates and apologized to a couple of times for our delay in the order.  But they should have kept up on the chips and salsa. The food was pretty good. Not overwhelmingly spicy or bland. They do have pretty good flan. I would try it again but maybe during the week."}
{"text":"On our first two visits, it was tolerable,  but not great.  We like the bartender,  and the food was ok.  Looking for something quick and near the house, we stopped in again.  Although there were 5 empty tables within view of the hostess station (Friday night before 8:00), the hostess told us it would be a 10-15 minute wait.  We said the bar was fine, and she said it was full.  We sat down, not minding the short wait, when after 5 minutes, another couple came in and asked about seating at the bar.  The hostess said there were seats available on the outside portion of the bar.  We sighed and figured we would do the same.  Unfortunately, only two seats are set up outside.  We left and had a great meal next door at Amalfi Pizzeria."}
{"text":"Really great Mexican food!! Always comes out piping hot. Chips and salsa are quite delicious an when they say they make the best  margarita in town (while costing 10$) they mean it! I ordered the coconut one and it had roared coconut on the rim and tasted like dessert!!! We have got the 3 item combo and the Mexican pizza never disappointed here"}
{"text":"I absolutly love this restraunt. I have been here 3 times and the food is amazing. The plate sizes are perfectly large too. My only complaint is that i had one of those coupons that come in the mail for money off the dinner plates and i bought two combo plates and was told i couldnt use it. I also had the yelp coupon and wasnt told till after that flan doesnt qualify. But other than that i have zero complaints id be definitly coming back in the near future several times i just wish i could have used that coupon."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in the west valley. Red chili and burrito Mexicano are awesome!  Service is great"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed.  The food was not good.  The service on the other hand was very good.  It's just ashame that the food was nowhere near the service.  We will not be back.  A word of advice, if you order the grilled chicken salad,  tell them to put more beans and not to load your plate with lettuce."}
{"text":"We love going here all the time.  The steak plate with rice beans and guac is so good!!!.   The margaritas are huge and super delicious.  Had lunch here Friday and my sister and I literally cleaned our carne asada lunch special platter!!!!"}
{"text":"We had wonderful service. The whole staff was kind and welcoming. We waited a bit for our food but it was well worth the wait.  I have celiacs and they were awesome about it. Very helpful and understanding!"}
{"text":"I have two words for you...House Margarita!  They are a must have.  Yes, they are $10, but there's a reason for it!  They are insanely tasty and even more insanely potent.  Be prepared...they seem harmless when you first start sipping on one.  But once you get to the bottom you are not going to be in the right frame of mind.  In fact, you'll want to order a second one and when you start drinking that one, well...you'll realize you probably should have stopped with the first!  Being picky with my Mexican food in this area (I'm a SD baja style fan) I actually didn't find theirs too bad at all.  Their salsa is nice and chunky but with a good amount of flavor.  Not at all bland like so many of the other spots and restaurants around the valley I've tried.  Both times I've been, I have ordered the Burrito Verde, and have not been disappointed.  It's easily shareable or good for leftovers.  It is filled with pork in a mild green sauce and topped with my favorite...tomatillo sauce.  Mmmmmmm good!    Did I mention the house margaritas yet?"}
{"text":"My new favorite place to eat! The food is super fresh and authentic. We will be back again and again"}
{"text":"Very friendly service. Comfortable restaurant. The Mexican food is authentic and good. Enjoyed the beef burrito with cheese and topped with a tasty red enchilada sauce. The rice was a nice surprise with corn. The tortilla chips tasted home made accompanied by the best salsa I've ever tasted. Muchas gracias Fiesta. Thanks for reading. The Bike Chaplain"}
{"text":"We went here for lunch, and split a plate of appetizers along with a side of chile relleno, and were actually stuffed after that :) I had 2 beers from the tap and wifey had what I can assume was a lava flow sort of pina colada drink -- they have margaritas and you can pick your own tequila, as well happy hour Mon-Thur from 3pm-7pm, friendly staff, great decor all around, and misters around the outdoor patio if you feel so inclined. Fiesta? oh yes!   Price, say about $9 a person for food, drinks about what you'd expect. They have many more pricier options for those that want to eat more, as well a tantalizing desert menu with all the traditional faves, flan, deep fried ice cream, and so on...   Don't expect street tacos or grab and go burritos, it's not that kinda food. This is good Mexican style sit-down-and-eat restaurant grub, with a few entrees from other south american cuisine as well."}
{"text":"We love this place. Great chips and salsa and all the meals we have tried have been excellent."}
{"text":"I am a mexican food lover! Sadly, all three times I've come I have been disappointed. The flavors on my taco salad and the chicken burrito we ordered were only so-so and could even fall into the bland category. Probably the best thing was the chips and salsa. Service was great and the ambiance is very fun and colorful so 3 stars for trying."}
{"text":"Cheap and good!! Everything homemade and fresh. Portions are a good size. Staff is always friendly and the owner is one of the nicest ladies I've ever met"}
{"text":"After reading many reviews and wanting an authentic mexican restaurant for a nice Father's Day meal, I ended up trying this place out with my family.    - Food = A- - Atmosphere = B - Service = C- - Speed of service = D  The place was very busy, but we were seated right away.  The booth that my family and I were led to had chips all over the floor along with the table's drink menu.  The waitress' attitude wasn't the best, but she took our order.   When the food arrived, it was very good, but took way too long to arrive (30+ minutes).  Unfortunately, my family and I filled up on chips and salsa so we didn't get to eat the entire meal.  If you are a salsa fanatic like I am, then you hate the taste of generic \"Pace\" style salsas served at authentic restaurants; sorry, but vinegar shouldn't be a salsa ingredient.  The salsa here wasn't bad and I could tell it was freshly made.  The waitress, Elizabeth, brought our food, but my son's order was wrong.  They quickly remade my son's quesadilla and all was good.  When it came time to pay the bill, I was told by Elizabeth that everyone with a military ID would receive a discount.  After my entire family showed their military ID, our bill went from $80 to $76.  We ended up saving less than 2% per meal for military appreciation; not impressed.   As my family and I were leaving, the last sting came when we noticed a sign in the window that said, \"Fathers eat free on Father's Day.\"  This was the last slap in the face from our waitress that didn't care about her customers.  We won't be returning to this restaurant anytime soon."}
{"text":"We have been here too many times to count because the food and service is consistently good. This is one of the cleanest restaurants we eat at. The servers are always polite and professional and most of them are downright friendly. They have the best menudo I have ever had in a restaurant...along with all the fixins'.  We have tried many different dishes from the menu and have never been disappointed. They are always helpful when you have questions about the menu. Too many names to mention, but Eric and Fernando are exceptional."}
{"text":"Great service, food was pretty darned good too. My wife and I had the combos dinner, her's with flair as and chimichanga, mine with crispy Chile relleno (really good), burrito, and chimichanga. Salsa was really tasty"}
{"text":"I really like this place. The food is really good and the portions are big enough so I always have left overs! If you get a combo meal to go it will easily feed 2 people with some left over. The environment is very colorful and clean."}
{"text":"Almost everything tasted homemade and the environment is fun and inviting! Everything comes out very hot and fresh!"}
{"text":"Great food and and great service. I ordered the green chili plate with flour tortillas and loved it. We also got margaritas and they had a nice orange zing to them, which was a nice change from the traditional flavor. We will be back."}
{"text":"Finally a place with delicious authentic food in Ocotillo. The staff is extremely friendly including the hostesses, severs, and bartenders. The inside of the restaurant is extremely clean and they have 10 high definition television s. The bar and patio areas are amazing"}
{"text":"Food was excellent! Service was great! We will be back for sure! New to town and finally found a chill spot to drink & eat."}
{"text":"went here on Saturday night and it was fairly busy. We had a large party, and the service was so great. I don't remember his name unfortunately, but he was super friendly and attentive. I had a margarita and it was delicious. For the meal I had the mole chicken enchiladas and they were also delicious. Everyone in our group really enjoyed the food and the service. The chips and salsa were on point. Salsa had a little bit of a kick and the tortilla chips were warm and crunchy. The portions were also huge. Had plenty of left overs. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in town. Fast and friendly service. 2 item combo for 11.99 not to shabby."}
{"text":"Never have had an issue here...service was good,as well as the food. Prices seem reasonable."}
{"text":"The food was just ok.  Not great, not bad, just ok.  The service we experienced was slow and inattentive.  If the food was better we might try again, to see if this was an off service night, but, it wasn't, so we won't likely return."}
{"text":"This place had great salsa, amazing food and a very clean atmosphere. My family and I will definitely be come back!!!"}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite restaurants when we lived in the area.  I am gluten free, so having a wait staff that knows the menu is a great thing, and these guys can steer you in the right direction.  The camaron a la plancha was my favorite.  They have 3 house made salsas to go with their chips that are very good.  If you don't like one, there are 2 others to try!"}
{"text":"New restaurant in Avondale. Very good food, friendly staff, good margaritas! The servings are enough for 2 meals. The Verde salsa is flavorful. And the margaritas are made perfect"}
{"text":"Micheladas are so good and their house salsa that they give with chips, actually not just tomatoes (+). Servers are always nice and mariachi on the weekends just brings the atmosphere together."}
{"text":"My family always has a fun and delicious experience at Fiest Mexicana. Our go-to place in the area."}
{"text":"Me and my wife are debating whether to give one star or two stars but either way we agree on one thing...  Save your money!   The place is overpriced and the food is not very good. My wife had a Chili Colorado burrito and it was very underwhelming with tough beef in a very plain tomato sauce. I had a Chili Verde burrito and it tasted heavily of vinegar. The service was rather bland as well to go with the food. We didn't even consider dessert given how disappointing the entrees were.   On the plus side, the food came out rather quickly and my wife enjoyed the spicy salsa.  We both agreed we won't be going back to Fiesta Mexicana. We suspect Fiesta Mexicana will have the same fate as Table 49."}
{"text":"Came in for the first time,  ordered 3 tacos meat only,  1 burrito and the bill was $31.50... what??? She said it's a good deal because it's $3.00 less than the meal.  Needless to say,  we won't be back.  Taco Tuesday anywhere but here... too expensive! Sorry guys"}
{"text":"Yesterday we took out-of-town guests here and we all thought the food was very good.  I had chicken strips with mole and thought it was very good.  The food platters are large and I was not able to finish everything.  The salsa and chips were good and everything tasted fresh.  The place was a little noisy but we could have a good conversation so it wasn't too bad.  We will definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"I had the shrimp enchillads for dinner which we're excellent I have been here a few other times and have never had a bad experience really love this place"}
{"text":"This is a very good restaurant.  We stopped by this place for a quick pit stop while traveling.  We ordered two plates, a mojarra plate, and a fajita mixta plate.  The waiter was very friendly and patient.  The atmosphere clean and the food was authentic.  Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"The service was great! The food was disgusting.  I ordered the pork verde. Pork was dry, plate was boiling, food was tepid, rice was salty. Just gross. However, the chips were great!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed, lost our appetite after the long wait - very loud.There is nothing authentic about this place."}
{"text":"Food is really flavorful. Chips are crispy and salsa is fresh and cold. The shredded beef and chicken are both juicy. The service wasn't too speedy but our server was really nice and we didn't mind the wait. Everything is tasty. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Food and drinks were terrific!  Best margaritas in Chandler!   Steak burrito with guacamole and sour cream hit the spot! The ambiance is perfect and it's a really fun place!"}
{"text":"I loved this place!  The atmosphere is bright, festive & fun.  Our server was friendly & efficient & food was out quickly & hot.  The food is at least average but all other factors outweigh it to boost it higher."}
{"text":"We go to Fiesta Mexican often.  The food is always excellent.  We have always had very good service.  The restaurant is clean. About two weeks before Cinco de Mayo, I made reservations for seven of us for 5:30.  We arrived about 15 minutes before our reservation time.  One member of our group checked in first.  She was told that we would be seated about 6:15.  I went to the desk and told them that we had 5:30 reservations.  We were told that we would be seated in just a few minutes.  Twenty minutes later we were still standing there.  We kept checking in and kept being told the same thing.  Granted, the restaurant was extremely busy, but just about everyone had reservations.  At almost 6:30 we were finally seated.  We were in the front of the restaurant, but in the back of the section.  We never saw a waitress.  After waiting 30 minutes, I used my cell phone to call the front desk.  Finally, a busboy was able to send a manager over.  She is the one who took care of us.  There was a party of 79 in one of their backrooms.  If you know that you have a huge party and you are booked solid for the night, then you should have enough sense to make sure that you have enough help.  As many times as we have been there and as much as we like the food, WE WILL NEVER EVER BE BACK!   I am glad that they were able to make it with so many places closing, but there are too many places to go to put up with that kind of nonsense."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Mexican restaurant in Arizona.  We frequent this place as often as possible. Prices are as fabulous as the food.  The volcano bowl and margarita is my recommendation for date night."}
{"text":"This place gets better every time we come!!! They have amazing dishes that are different from the norm."}
{"text":"The only reason it's getting four stars is because we love this place back in Page. The customer service here is a hit and miss. Quality is still there!"}
{"text":"The fiesta is for your eyes when you walk in. Holy super Mexican decor! I wanted to like this place. Very interesting vegetarian menu. I liked the spinach enciladas. My wife's taquitos were filled with mushy chicken meat. Rice was good but real salty, beans had no salt, so I mixed them together. Place gets 2 stars instead of 3 for horrible service. Took forever to see our waiter, never refilled my drink but asked if I wanted one when he brought my bill after dinner was over. It was not busy either...."}
{"text":"Been here three times now and have had a great experience every time.  The service was great and I really love the authentic Mexican recipes and the abundance of seafood choices like several shrimp dishes and crab legs.   Recently I've had the chile relleno and tacos al carbon--all delicious with general portions.  Previously I had the tacos al pastor which were great, it's tough to find good al pastor in the Chandler or Phoenix areas. I look forward to coming for happy hour soon and having the nachos deluxe--tip: if you like your salsa hot, ask for the green hot salsa made with habanero chilis--its fire!"}
{"text":"Super authentic Mexican Cuisine unlike any other place in the valley. Homemade recipes lots of seafood options and truly authentic Sonoran Mexican Cuisine."}
{"text":"Don't be misled by the name. If you have to tell customers this is real Mexican food, it likely not. And that is exactly what I found here on my first visit.  First of all they don't sell any \"Aguas frescas\". That's right no horchata here.  Ordered a Pepsi and got a rootbeer.  I ordered fajitas, which were very bland and over cooked. The plate of fajitas included more onions and pepper than actual meat.  Plus I think it was priced a little high at $14.95.  My wife had a plate that included chipotle flavored steak. She disliked it so much that she asked to waiter to take it back. And they did.  The tortillas were hardly warm.  The one thing I did like was the salsa and the quick refills on chip and drinks.  I visited the restaurant with 5 other people and non of us care too much for this food.   In conclusion, I will not be returning to this place, nor will I recommend it.  If you are in the mood for Mexican food, go else where."}
{"text":"Pretty pricy fir mediocre food.  But, the place has s bright snd cheery atmosphere.  I had the fiesta skirt steak which was thin and tough, but the sauce was great !  The mrs had the fiesta seafood and loved the crab. Tourist trap for gringos"}
{"text":"Been here a couple times now and this place just feels right. The decorations and the vibe scream FIESTA! Food is great and good quality and service is good. Def be going there again."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Food is quite good...service is excellent. I'm always greeted with a smile and I've never had a \"bad\" server. The chips and salsa are always fresh and uniquely delicious. The portions are huge and the prices are reasonable. All in all, a great place for Mexican when you're craving for a burrito or \"chiminichangana\"."}
{"text":"Good food.  Great quick service!  Ana our server gave us very good service.  We would highly recommend this location.  The only complaint we have that it gets very loud inside.  Maybe lower the volume of the music."}
{"text":"Huge plates, solid food choice. Fajita salad was very good, but the chicken plates lacked flavor, so I recommend getting the beef."}
{"text":"Everything was salty, I don't know what kind of sauce they put on their burritos but it is not good. I will not eat here again."}
{"text":"Best option for real Mexican food in the West Valley.  Everything is good and the house Margarita's (rocks w/ salt, please) are awesome.  Excellent service...always!"}
{"text":"We went for happy hour and had the Mexican pizza and the chicken flautas. The Mexican pizza had some of the worst tasting seasoned shredded beef that I've ever tasted.  The flautas were cheaply made rolled corn tortillas that they cut in half for happy hour. The salsa was horribly chunky with no flavor. The happy hour prices were not great like some of the other local restaurants. You have to ask for a happy hour menu because they sure don't offer you one The server was very nice and very attentive. We just live around the corner but we will not be going back.  Save your money and go someplace else."}
{"text":"I flew down from Seattle and this was my first stop after leaving the airport. I absolutely love this place because it reminds me of a similar restaurant back home! Also I'm in LOVE with all the colorful art!!"}
{"text":"Food and drinks are awesome!! They have an amazing happy hour!! Nancy was a great server!"}
{"text":"I went here because of the good reviews, but was disappointed. I would never go back. Food was too salty and expensive."}
{"text":"Was hoping for a decent Mexican restaurant in South Chandler but instead got a Mexican Denny's. Lots of sloppy food with no taste and a bit overpriced. Do have a nice patio and drinks were OK if that's all your looking for.  Too bad doubt it will last very long. Take your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place I heard it was really good. Boy they were wrong. Salsa was horrible. Bland and tasted burnt. Cheese Crisp was hard. Sierra mist tasted dirty. My sons chicken strips were hard and burnt. My taquito was burnt and greasy. My enchilada was ok but sauce tasted from can and rice looked greasy and tasted bland. We will NOT be back. Very over priced!"}
{"text":"I have to agree with most of the reviews on here, the chips and salsa are good and the service leaves something to be desired. We went for lunch a couple days ago and ordered off the lunch menu, we got the Carne asada plate and a chile relleno and chimi combo, the beans needed salt and the rice was dry. The meat was cooked perfect and the chile and chimi where good. They didn't have mexican Aguas/drinks such as horchata, which is not cool. There was a piece of plastic in the guacamole on the Carne asada plate, you can see it in the pic near the rice. When we informed the manager she apologized and offered to replace meal, but by that time we were almost done. No smiles on staff faces at all. Real shame the service is bland as well as the food, since the restaurant itself has a nice mexican ambiance."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service!  Will return when I'm back on this side of town!! I had the chicken taquitos appetizer!  Free dessert for checking in"}
{"text":"Very spicy salsa , greasy chips, worst quesadilla I ever had. Food below average in quality and way over priced -will not be back"}
{"text":"My husband and I haven't had such great Mexican food since we moved to the West Valley. So very glad that we found this place! We also love the atmosphere. So fun!"}
{"text":"This is the second time my husband and I have been here. The Margaritas are amazzzzzing!!  Close to our home and lots of menu items to choose from"}
{"text":"Excellent food, huge selection and reasonable prices. A new favorite. Fabulous service too!!!  The food is hot and fresh. The wait staff is friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"New chef and great customer service. We love this place. Crispy chile relleno is amazing!"}
{"text":"In my opinion, the West Valley is blessed with several really good options if you're in the mood for Mexican food and a few GREAT options as well. Fiesta Mexicana falls into the latter category.  I've enjoyed more than a few really good meals here and the service is always excellent. Each time, I've made a point to try something different. The ceviche is especially good! It's a great indicator of the quality of the seafood on the menu. Tonight, the Aguachile was the star. It's a spicy dish with a lime & jalapeño tomatillo sauce. Think of it as a ceviche with chunks of cucumber, onions, tomatoes and avocado. It had a generous portion of perfectly \"cooked\" shrimp. This is a killer dish if you're looking for something light.  Chips and salsa is hard to mess up, but it's possible. However, the chips and salsa here are very good. And the chicken taquito appetizer was delicious. The chicken was moist and the tortilla was perfectly crispy. Hard to believe there was room for desert, but I really wanted to try the fried ice cream. It looked like a sundae, but it definitely had a Mexican flair from the corn flake crust to the tortilla shell it was served in. This desert is generous enough for two to share. And who knew chocolate syrup paired well with a Corona?!?  Fiesta Mexicana has survived in a location where other restaurants have come and gone. And it's busy most every time I visit. Perhaps it's the vibrant atmosphere. Maybe it's the presence of live mariachi music. Regardless, I am glad this restaurant has survived the test of time! Muchas gracias!"}
{"text":"Variety, price, quality, ambiance, location, service- can't wait to come back! You cannot go wrong with any selection!"}
{"text":"Where's the fiesta?!?!? I'm so disappointed with this experience. I arrive at 11:30 & there were only a few tables. You'd think service would be quick & friendly. I ordered water & my food (tostadas deluxe) from a man who was probably the manager. A waiter brought my food and I was not checked on after that. Two more tables were seated around me yet the waiter not once asked to refill my water or if I needed anything. I had to get up and ask the hostess to have someone bring my check. Customer service was not the only let down.  There was no music or ambiance about the place. The decor was cute but no one had personality and the lack of music made it very dull.  Now the food... The food was bland. The chicken had no seasoning or flavor to it. I could tell it had been cooked in a red sauce but could not taste the sauce. If I hadn't felt the texture of the beans on the bottom of the tostada, I wouldn't have known they were there. The highlight of the meal was the guacamole served on top of the tostadas. It was the one thing that had flavor.  I can cook better food at home & have better ambiance. This was a true disappointment."}
{"text":"Went with a group great choice. The portions are big. Everyone enjoyed what they ordered. Service was great. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Meeting my Aunt who was in town. I really don't know much about this area for restaurants so I yelped it! I am very hesitant of trying Mexican Restaurants since I have two favorites in the valley. So I will always compare any new place I try out, which may be a little unfair?  However, Fiesta Mexicana may not be on the same level of my two favorites. But they are very close. We had a table of seven, workers were very nice and helpful. Ordered our drinks and gave us chips and salsa very quickly. Chips were good, salsa were very good and had a nice kick. First, they have a huge menu and can become overwhelming. So I suggest you have an idea what you want to eat before looking at the menu. I had their Pollo al le Crema. Its grilled chicken with rice and beans and mushroom cream sauce. It was very good and I really enjoyed it. I know that two other people had shrimp burritos, and were very satisfied with their dish. My Aunt had the chili verde burrito and enjoyed here dish also. The other three, i'm really not sure or cared what they had. But I know there wasn't any complaints from them. Since it was Friday, they had a live Mariachi music. They were awesome and really liven up the place. The only reason why they did not get five stars were the fact they added the gratuities on the check and it was pretty darn high. I was probably going to give them more anyways. But I don't like the fact how they can assume that everything was fine enough to give them self that tip?  With that said, we will be coming back when ever we are in the area. Great place, and we now have three different spots we like in the valley!"}
{"text":"Their salsa is amazing. The atmosphere is great. Very clean restaurant. The service was prompt and the food was A+. Our new favorite Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"I will def come back here. The only downside is you get 1 refill of your fountain drink. Service was amazing, very attentive. The shredded beef chimichanga had very well seasoned beef and perfectly flaky exterior.  They could have cooked their enchiladas a little more, but the sauce was delicious.  And their rice was the best I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"Decided to go because of the reviews. Big mistake. This place is overpriced for low quality food (can get better food at filibertos or one of those corner restaurants. Food is not authentic not even tasty! I order the chicken flautas the chicken didn't look nor tasted like chicken. All I can say is that I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Well first of all I had been wanting to try this place out for a while. I have to say the food was good but management very unfair. They have advertised buy a $25. Gift card and recieve  $5. Extra, so a total of $30. Credit. When we asked to purchase two gift cards total of $50. With $10. Free credit, they started the transaction but soon after they told us there internet was down and they wouldn't be able to provide us with gift cards. Which by the way we had planned on using that night. So we asked the manager if they would do anything for us for the inconvenience. They told us it was not there fault the internet was down. Wow! I was shocked to hear they would not honor something they had advertised. In my opinion that was a poor management decision. What happen to customer satisfaction?"}
{"text":"Lovely setting, bright & cheerful. Huge menu, but just had 1 chicken taco with rice & beans. It was only fair, very little flavor in the meat, rice & beans were bland.  Says \"authentic Mexican food,\" but tasted disappointingly like GringoMex. However, the chips were good, salsa was flavorful with a nice kick. Wait staff was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"First, I love the atmosphere of this place. Very colorful with all the art Mexican theme throughout the entire restaurant. I did notice a few places where there was damage to the walls and one spot int the front being held up by tape but minor fixes. Place was very clean. Dishes clean.   Our server was excellent! Very fast, kind, there if we needed anything.   We ordered the cheese crispy as an app. The tortilla was a bit burnt but still it was good. Love the chips and salsa. I ordered a carne asada steak which was good. Not the best carne but still very good. Wife ordered the green chili enchiladas which she loved. Both came with side of rice and beans. One of my daughters ordered loaded nachos and the other ordered a cheese quesadilla. Both said their food was really good too! We had a really good time.    Overall, my take on this place: Excellent!  I love this place and will be going back! Take the family or a date, for a good authentic Mexican restaurant experience and great food!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Great food and service. You cannot miss this place. Cadillac margaritas are fantastic as well."}
{"text":"After reading some of the earlier negative post I was quite shocked after visiting this place.  We've been there 4 times now and not once a bad experience.   The salsa was amazing !   The food was fresh and tasty. The service was impeccable !!!  Friendly efficient staff!  We asked for flour chips which were not on the menu and they gladly made them for us with no fuss or extra charges.  It was all delicious and they don't skimp on the margaritas !   You can actually taste the alcohol.  Prices are more then fair !  I can't say enough good about this place other then I prefer wood or tile floors vs carpet flooring.  Would definitely recommend to those who like good  hand made cold margs and excellent fresh salsa !"}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  Service almost nonexistent, which is surprising considering the restaurant was empty on a Sunday night.  Got our food and didn't see the waiter again for at least fifteen minutes.  Had to ask someone else to find him when we wanted the check.   Restaurants don't last in that location.  Looks like we will be losing another one at Fulton Ranch. Wonder what kind of food we will get in the next one!  Manager and server argued with my sister over a $2.00 charge. It's a shame you've lost us as customers.  What happened to the customer is always right even if he isn't?  Mgr told us there was nothing he could do to rectify problem.   How ridiculous is that? All over $2.00!"}
{"text":"Great service from Ricardo! Kept our drinks filled and checked on us multiple times.  Food was delicious, great chips and salsa and the shredded beef on my tostada had great flavor.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant, love the nachos, nice servers. Very nice atmosphere, we frequent often."}
{"text":"Best margaritas in Chandler! You can't go wrong with the margaritas at Fiesta! Very tasty and have a nice kick to them. The Cadillac Margarita is the best. The staff is extremely friendly and the food is great. They are very personable. I really like the Tacos al Pastor and the Carnitas de Pollo. Very family friendly atmosphere. They also have live music on Sat nights. We are regulars!"}
{"text":"Food great for the price. Chips and salsa on point. Sauces were amazing. Didn't expect a virgin colada to be $6"}
{"text":"Went with my neighbor a couple of times the food, service & atmosphere  were enjoyable."}
{"text":"The Yelper in me had to try the food.  The first time I visited Fiesta Mexicana was for happy hour and I have to say the margaritas were absolutely refreshing. Not only are the margaritas refreshing at Fiesta Mexicana but they are very large, very delicious, and very deadly, so be careful!  Today, the \"yelper\" inside me gave  into temptation and decided to go to Fiesta Mexicana for lunch after reading all the positive reviews.   Fiesta Mexicana is vibrantly decorated with beautiful, hand-painted booths and table tops.  The menu at Fiesta Mexicana has a variety of interesting choices, so it was a challenge to narrow my selection to a single entrée.   The service at Fiesta Mexicana was excellent.  Our server was fantastic. He was very nice, friendly, and  attentive.  He took the time to explain the menu to us and answered all our questions satisfactorily. My only complaint was the lack of chips that were served, the bowl wasn't even half full.  As I looked around I noticed no one was served a \"full\" bowl of chips. However, the chips and sauce were wonderful.   The prices at Fiesta Mexicana are slightly higher then other Mexican food restaurants in the area, but  the portions just right. Today I had the beef flatas with sour cream and guacamole, and it was good. My lunch companions had  tacos, rice, chimi, enchilada, and they enjoyed their food.   Lunch was enjoyable , I will visit again."}
{"text":"Good food, especially the crispy chile relleno. The salsa was very good, spicy. The menu had lots of choices. Definitely will go here again. Good service."}
{"text":"We had a delicious dinner here! Their chimichangas are great and our daughter loved the enchiladas. Definitely worth the trip across town."}
{"text":"Large restaurant with plenty of seats. Mexican food is just good not great and a must have."}
{"text":"I would give this restaurant no stars! It was awful! The owner was mean and didn't believe my husband and I that there was a fruit fly that flew out of his rice. The owner insisted he didn't have flys or Mosquitos in his kitchen. He was rude and showed no customer service. I read several reviews on here on the lemons and mine had black spots on them as well. When I ordered my food it was very bland and cold! We had to wait to eat our food because the waitress didn't give us forks right away and we had to continue to wait for everything. The forks, the check, the drinks, etc. I would never eat here again. Customer service goes along way. Oh, and the sign outside says authentic mexican food but there is nothing authentic about it. It taste like Taco Bell. I order a beef chulupa and got some kind of mystery meat."}
{"text":"The decor is nice, the food is not authentic Mexican food. If you're okay with that, enjoy."}
{"text":"It's a really good place for Mexican food. I got the chicken tampequeña, and it was AMAZING.  my family and I loved the food. The waitress was nice, and served us well. Prices were good for what we ordered. We'd definitely come back again."}
{"text":"It seems like most of the reviewers here expected much more than they got out of this restaurant. I've learned to not expect too much from any Mexican restaurant as it's unlikely to find a great one. Is it really authentic? I'm not certain I would know since I'm not from Mexico and don't travel there, so I t's not a factor in my choice of a restaurant. I would rank this one higher than many I've visited in the past.   I had a decent experience here and the other four in my party did as well. It wasn't perfect as the wait was a bit long for the entrees and my husband had to wait even longer for his special. I wouldn't rave about anything but I liked the chips and salsa. They did not seem store bought to me.  I had the pica (shredded) beef tostada grande and it was good. Everyone else enjoyed their meal as well, however one person did not get exactly what she thought she ordered. I will most likely come back here again."}
{"text":"Oh man - I loved this place! Was in town for work and met up with family I have in the area and they took me here. It was just the perfect Mexican food I was craving. There were so many awesome selections of dishes that it was hard to decide. I did finally choose the green chile pork. O...M...G!!!! It was one of the best chile verde I've ever had. The depth of the rich flavors was amazing. I could have just licked the platter clean! The pork was tender and flavorful.  I'm getting ahead of myself though, let's talk about the chips and salsa. It's really hard to find really good chips and salsa where I live in Tennessee. These were so good. The first salsa they brought out had such a great flavor, but was a bit spicy. I guess I've lost my stamina to  handle spicy salsas. Then they brought out a mild one for the kids at the table. So I mixed the two together and it was the perfect heat balance for me. I could have just eaten that, but glad I went with the entree too.  I really enjoyed the food and the services was nice too. Friendly and attentive server."}
{"text":"I have to agree with the other complaints. I was excited for a Mexican restaurant to be close to my house.  I judge Mexican food by the Chili Rellanos. Theirs was way too hot and I LIKE hot, but CR's are not supposed to be hot. They left the seeds in the Chili Rellanos.  So I am back to driving to the \"hood\" for real Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Not a fan.  Did not like the salsa or hot sauce, Chile rellano gross.  Way to eggy.  Too much cumin on fajitas.. won't be back"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! Good service and great authentic Mexican food. I try to go at least once a month. If they would put one in buckeye I would be there everyday"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time tonight. Both the wife and I had steak and shrimp fajitas. Cooked perfect and tasted great. Our server, Elizabeth, was on it too. Woulda been 5 stars but there were only 3 shrimp in the fajitas. Not sure if that's how they usually come or I got short changed. Will be going back to eat there again and find out."}
{"text":"It was an unexpectedly good meal. I had the burrito Verde and I was extremely pleased. The chips and salsa are good, which is always an indication of how the food is going to be, at least for me. The service is good and the atmosphere is excellent. Looks and tastes very authentic. If you are looking for authentic Mexican food, than this is the place for you. It is not tex-mex!  Seems like it would be a great place to have a party as well, with large dining areas. Lots of tvs with a bar as well."}
{"text":"Food was good and server was helpful but have never paid 26.99 for a pitcher of beer. Overpriced!"}
{"text":"1st time.  Excellent food.  Our server was Casey  (chandler location manager), she is warm, friendly and very enjoyable to talk to.  We will definitely be back again,  soon! May even go out to chandler to see her again :)"}
{"text":"This was our first time here....  food was good, service was slow!  When we had finished the table next to us bent to pick up something on the floor and was greeted by a cockroach.  Not sure if he'll share the picture, but I think this place is a one and done for us."}
{"text":"Visited Fiesta Mexicana on Sunday for breakfast. To my surprise not much of a selection for a home cooked Mexican breakfast. I was looking for bacon, eggs and home cook potatoes with tortillas. I settled for a Bowl of menudo. The menudo was good with all the sides. Our waitress was okay, not very welcoming. The cost was somewhat expensive but the food was good. I will come back again by myself or bring my wife but will not bring the family, to costly."}
{"text":"My family's preferred restaurant for Mexican food! Consistent good quality, just takes a bit of time to get your food..."}
{"text":"Good Mexican food, fair prices. Service was good and the atmosphere was good as well. We will eat here again. PS we came in at 9:00 PM they close at 10:00 but they were still on their game."}
{"text":"Food is good just like it always is. Their steak is very well seasoned! Salsa was very spicy today, which we really enjoyed. They make their drinks really strong, but no complaints on that front. The only thing that's consistently annoying is the SUPER LOUD mariachi. Sounds great from 20 feet away, but way too loud when they are right next to your table. We will be back, trying to avoid the live mariachi"}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican places I've been to in Phoenix in 18 months.  Food, portions & price was spot on.  Our waiter was a little rushed, but came through for us"}
{"text":"I think they need to change the name from \"Authentic Mexican\" to \"Authentic Microwave\".   I had the worst Chili Relleno of my life.   We got there just before 6 on Friday night and the place was packed with people waiting to be seated.  We chose to sit at the bar on the outside side.   It was dark and the lights out there were not working.  Seeing the menu was close to impossible.       We ordered 10 dollar Cadillac Margaritas which were the bar $5.95 Margarita with a Grand Mariner side shot.   No special Tequila.  We then ordered our food........my chili Relleno and my husband's chili verde burrito.   When the food came within 5 minutes the red flag went up.   There is no way to make a chili Relleno in less than 5 minutes.  Really???  It's was COLD on the INSIDE.   Best part of my meal......the rice.  Sad!    My husbands chili verde was tender but someone in the kitchen spilled an entire shaker of salt on it.    A very disappointing $50.00 dinner.   Won't be back."}
{"text":"KEEP driving! I was staying over night in Phoenix and drove 30 miles here bases on reviews. Worst food I've ever had. Waitress couldn't get order right. Had a who cares attitude. Place was hot and old looking. Would not got back. Where's all the good Mexican food in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Ordered the taco salad and yikes. All of the beans and super greasy chicken are on the bottom of the \"salad\" which created a total dissolving of the bottom of the shell. Then there was maybe 1/4 cup of lettuce on top of the taco salad puddle. I had been getting flyers for this place for a long time and I guess they will be thrown away with the rest of the junk mail without a second thought now. We were looking for a new Mexican food restaurant to add into our rotations and we will keep looking."}
{"text":"We just gave this place a try last night and it was amazing! Everything about it! The atmosphere was great (we sat at the bar), the staff was great, drinks were perfect (and strong!) and the food was the best Mexican I have had in a long time! We will definitely be going here again."}
{"text":"The food here was really good and the servers were great.  Not sure I would go back as it is the most expensive food I have had in Phoenix.  $15 burritos is completely insane for what most places charge.  $3.50 chocolate milk for my daughter was also a little outrageous.   It's a shame because the food was good overall."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to some Mexican food at Fiesta Mexicana and left a little disappointed. I have been here before and enjoyed the food but today was blah.  If you have never been, the setting is very nice with lots of decorative tables and chairs throughout. They have televisions everywhere if your interested in catching a game of some sort. They offer a restaurant and bar setting. As for the service......I have always had nice servers here who generally get the food out fairly quickly and today was no different. As for the food, chips and salsa are very good and they offer salsa is mild, medium, or hot. I think they generally put out medium unless you ask for another.  For dinner, the wife had the Americana burrito (I think), and I tried the mole enchiladas.  Both dishes were okay at best.  Nothing real special or that I would refer anyone to. For dessert, since we checked in with yelp, we were provided with a free sopapillas. It was nice to have a free dessert but after seeing it was a $5 dessert, I can not see how someone would pay that much for so little.  I was tiny and came with a little dab of whip cream and cherries. Again, not complaining since it was free, but I would be disgusted if I paid for that. Anyway, may come again, or may just pay half and go to Senor Taco."}
{"text":"Fiesta Mexican in Avondale, AZ.  Dropped by for lunch - great food and service.  I will be back."}
{"text":"From the moment you walk in the door and view the colorful interior, it's obvious this is a restaurant that put some thought into details.  That same concern for excellence is reflected in the food.  The menu is extensive, offering combo luncheon plates to seafood entrees.    I had tasted the enchiladas suizas prior to this visit -- one of my favorites.  On this trip I had the lunch combo of a tamale and burrito.  My brother went for the taco and chili relleno.  All items came with tender shredded meat.  And we didn't encounter one piece of fat (something that makes me shudder when I suddenly bite into it).    The service was good.  Salsa tasty.  My brother said he definitely wanted to come back."}
{"text":"We were greeted by hostess who did not seem the friendliest. We were quoted and sat in the beautifully decorated bench underneath the Tv in the waiting area.   Once we were sat several minutes went by before we were greeted. Mind you this is our first time here and we were just a party of two. So we start to browse the menu. I decided to order something off the vegetarian friendly section in the back of the menu.  When we received our food I discovered my order was completely wrong and we had no silverware, I had ordered a bean and cheese burrito and I received a chicken chimichanga... It took another 8 minutes to actually get out server's attention. When all was corrected and we finished, we realized were faced with the challenge of how we're we going to get our server's attention to get our check?   I have to confess that the busboys were more helpful and attentive than our server. They offered to take our plates once they saw that we were finished and I even asked one for a take out box which he brought me with a smile.   In conclusion, the food, is nothing special. The service I can live without. The reason why they get two stars is because of the polite busboys and their large menu selection."}
{"text":"I didn't like this place because there service is so slow that the people next to us got here like ten mins after and they got there food before us and if you ask for a something plain they put a lot of other stuff in there. The ceviche de camaron looked a lot more like a huge bowl of shrimp cocktail. It was very lemony and it had a lot of Clamato.  The free dessert for check in only applies to a churro or some other bread dessert."}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday and had a few Margaritas (delicious) and shared a variety of the food. Everything was amazing and our server was very nice. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great place to eat Mexican food when your in AZ. Tried the Fiesta Mediana and it was pretty good. Enchiladas sauce was not hot, but wish it was, the taco was okay and beans and rice were excellent"}
{"text":"Great food!! Good service! The margaritas are amazing, especially the coconut one!!"}
{"text":"Great food.  Wonderful service.  Very reasonable prices, especially at happy hour  . I used to go to the one inn CO and was thrilled that this restaurant is as good as that one.  Very tasty. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Found this gem of a Mexican food restaurant. The service is always prompt , with water and chips and salsa coming almost as soon as we're seated. The salsa is great , chunks of fresh ingredients and a note , they have a mild salsa available also.  The entree sizes are large and the food wonderful, from the shrimp wrapped in bacon to the burritos. And don't leave without dessert, churros and the fried ice cream are tops.  They have a good selection of tequilas and the bar area is always buzzing . Great service and food, I recommend to all."}
{"text":"The food was well over portioned for the price point. Authentic for sure!!! Great food and service."}
{"text":"We walked in and was very pleased with the old style Mexican decor.  The chips and salsa was the bomb but the main dishes were very good too. Large portions and very delicious.  We will be back to eat there again! Give them a chance, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The place has a nice patio and not much more. Service was slow, meal prep even slower, chips were bland, tasteless, salsa so-so. The to the meal. The rice tasted like Uncle Ben's white rice, I could not find any seasoning, the enchiladas weak with little meat and I guess you can't mess up refried beans.   Will not return to this \"authentic Mexican food\" place, they have never been to Mexico.."}
{"text":"Very authentic. If you're a taco lover and picky about your tacos you will love theirs! Delicious food and salsa"}
{"text":"I lucked out as I live right up the street and due to the vicinity, I gave it a try....GREAT restaurant, some of the best chips and salsa I have ever had, BIG PLUS! They seem to be always running a drink special, so ask, we do, and usually they are  a pretty good deal with quality to match. They even have XL mugs of Micheladas, iced, on a hot day? HEAVEN...Onto the menu, here's where they drop a star, and its not a huge downgrade. Its the 'ol must try different items on the extensive menu to find out whats best syndrome. I have had a couple amazing dishes here, and some not so amazing...So lets focus on the good...Those amazing dishes made up for the others, hence why I love this place! Service has been great every time we have come, servers know the menu fairly well, with some suggestions. (It must be said that as a vet of this industry I absolutely go to restaurants at non-peak hours). I tend to get sat immediately, get my orders quickly, and wave to the crowds on the way out...Not willing to try any of the other choices of Mexican restaurants around, after reading all the poor reviews, I would suggest trying this establishment immediately...you will be happy you did..."}
{"text":"I love this place. My favorite is their menudo on the weekends. When they run out of menudo, because it's so good, I get the enchiladas rancheros. Nothing but great food and great service every time I go."}
{"text":"The food has greatly improved since they first opened. Unfortunately the bartenders are inattentive and fairly unfriendly for the most part. We will be back, but we hope for better service from the bar staff."}
{"text":"Excellent food had the crispy chilies. And the queso was amazing! Service was awesome! Definitely recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"Our family ate here last night and we loved it. Great salsa; margaritas had a good taste and weren't too strong. We had the chicken fajitas (great spice on the chicken), the plate of chicken, bell peppers and such, and the enchiladas fiesta, which was absolutely delicious (especially the seasoning on the steak). Great service by the man working on the floor, helping make drinks, and generally running all over the floor...with a smile on his face and taking the time to check on his customers."}
{"text":"It is clear from previous reviews that either people have different ideas of what constitutes Mexican food, or that employees are writing reviews.  We were excited at the prospect of a new Mexican choice close to home, as Casa Blanca had seemed to slip a notch recently. We went on a Friday night around 7PM. There were plenty of open tables, but we still had to wait 15 minutes for a table. To be that empty on a Friday night should have been our first red flag, and hearing the Mariachi band from the waiting area should have been our second warning.   We were seated, and greeted by a friendly wait person who took our drink orders immediately. The mariachis were a table away from us, so conversation was limited until they moved away. They were truly horrible, and while we were there, they repeated their very small repertoire a couple of times (3 times for La Bamba!).  The decor reminded me of a fake Mexican place you would find in a tourist area. Whomever was sitting behind me was either bouncing against the booth back, or the furniture were so flimsy that each time they moved it creaked and moved on me. We were treated to a plexiglass table top and paper napkins.  The food arrived in about the time you would expect. The Chile Con Queso was a chunk of cheese melted with some roasted Jalapenos thrown in, as it cooled it turned greasy and stringy.   I ordered the Chile Verde, my wife got a combo of Taco and Enchilada. The food could have come from any fast food Mexican place, the beans from a can.  The meal ended, and the Mariachis were getting closer to the table again. I think the wait person was just as anxious to avoid them as I was, as she dissapeared for a good 10 minutes while we sat waiting. A Bus erson even came by and started clearing our table.  None of it was truly bad (oh, wait, the mariachis were), but none of it was good, and at about $12 per entree, it fell far short of expectations.  I hope the next restaurant to go into that spot is better!"}
{"text":"We come here often. The service is wonderful & the drinks & food we order are always prepared fast & taste great!"}
{"text":"How is it possible this place does not have better reviews?? It is fantastic!! The food is fantastic and the prices are reasonable! The service is great! The salsa is so so good! We love that they have happy hour throughout the week and its a great place to stop in for date night on the weekends too. Their food is good and authentic. Their fried ice cream is awesome and huge especially for the price! Their chimi is awesome but I can say the enchiladas arn't the best. Tortilla chips taste handmade and fresh every time. Its always packed with people so I am shocked there isn't more reviews reflecting how awesome this place is."}
{"text":"Several people wrote about this on Ocotillo Friends, mixed reviews so we decided to give it a try. We went on a Friday night last week, and right away had 3 kinda comical but strange seating issues. They just were not communicating w each other, and they would seat the wrong people next and said to us \"wait you wanted an outside table right?\" When we hadn't told anyone about a seat preference. Minor but they were just all mixed up and we had to come back to the foyer 3 times. We ordered a combo consisting of a cheese enchiladas and shredded beef taco and house margaritas. My husband ordered a carnitas type burrito. The margaritas are huge and would be good with better tequila. The salsa came and was not good at all. It tastes like onion juice if there is such a thing and the tiny container had very little known ingredients, slightly chunky but mostly puréed like it couldn't make up its mind what type of salsa to be. The chips were ok not special. The tiny red cheap plastic container  they came in seemed out of place at what by all appearances looks like a nicer Mexican restaurant. They look like they would belong at a food truck or a mall restaurant but not a nice restaurant. They were super tiny as well and help very few chips. After inquiring about the cheese and onion red enchilada and how much onion was in it, I decided to ask for a \"tiny amount of onion.\" I asked for a shredded beef taco. I received an enchilada with 2 full tablespoons of onions. I cook a lot and I estimated it to be about two tablespoons. It was as if they completely ignored my request for very little onions. Or maybe it was just a mistake. I didn't care for the red sauce. It tasted like canned red enchilada sauce with a sweet kick to it. Not my thing. I could barely eat much of it. I looked for the waitress but she never came back so I ate what I could of the rice, beans, and what I could salvage of the enchilada and then moved onto the shredded beef taco. I opened it to add the salsa and discovered it was chicken! Again I looked around for our waitress, but she never ever came back to check on us even once. We finally flagged her down and told her the issues, but by then we were ready to leave and asked for an adjustment. The service was taking too slow to wait for the beef taco. She came back with our adjustment after 24 minutes. It was 50% off my meal, not the entire ticket but my meal, and yes I think that was wrong. I would not est there again. The customer service is slow and not supreme. The food is less than mediocre. The building/restaurant is pretty though."}
{"text":"First Mexican food I've had here in Phoenix area, Chips and salsa were good medium heat Margueritas were good  I had shrimps wrapped in chicken breast which was wrapped in bacon with mushroom sauce. Service was pretty good but it was lunchtime. This place is worth stopping in again"}
{"text":"Nice place to come and eat. We ordered items that were not on the menu and they took care of us.   Definitely.  recommend this place.   Thanks to the server Trevor"}
{"text":"Fiesta is the Mexican restaurant that never fails you. Want a Caddy Margy? They have it. Want a giant burrito deep fried and served with sour cream? They have it. And anything else Mexican your heart desires.  And BONUS kick ass salsa music!!!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour...$2.49 ALL drafts including imports. Sit at the bar and visit with Christopher the bar tender with house made margaritas.  Authentic decor great food."}
{"text":"Good prices on drinks until 7 p.m. Great chips and salsa Combo places are the bomb- they lose one star because they are cheap-os making you pay extra for a dollop of guacamole or sour cream that other places include for free."}
{"text":"Best Fajitas in Town   Chicken had the best marinade   Will be back  Almost forgot $3.99 Margaritas tasted amazing was expecting much for the Price I was blown away"}
{"text":"I went to this place with my girlfriends family after her brothers graduation. When we got there we asked our server for a quick minute to look at the menu. The server didn't return for 20 mins, she takes our order then gets my girlfriend's mother order incorrectly after we clearly stated and reiterated for her before she left. Food was okay but not worth it for the poor service we received"}
{"text":"We made reservations for 22  ahead of time we got there early to start with a drink while others came and we were stopped by the front desk and told us we were  20mins early and they weren't ready for us. We waited outside for 10mins and they came back to say our table was ready. Alex, Christian and the other waiter didn't catch his name all waited on us. They were fantastic. They constantly checked on us and filled our drinks and chips. Our food was delicious and heard no complaints. I will spread the word around about great food and wonderful service. Thanks guys you made our experience perfect!"}
{"text":"We were really excited. I mean really excited for this restaurant to open. We eagerly watched the remodel from Table 49 to Fiesta Mexicana and were so happy to have another restaurant near our house. We went in for dinner and as we were walking up to the front door, noticed a lot of after-dinner mint wrappers and cigarette butts on the ground. Sad that customers littered but it detracted from the beautiful building and gorgeous outdoor seating. We were greeted quickly at the front door and the inside has been completely remodeled with lots of uniquely hand-painted chairs and booths.   The restaurant boasts \"authentic\" Mexican food but it is more like American-Mexican food similar to ordering at a chain restaurant. We were expecting more of an eclectic Mexican menu. We were happy to see octopus on the menu but that's where it stopped. No machaca. The menu consisted of burritos, tacos and the sort with rice and beans.   Chips and salsa came quickly after we sat down but there were only about 12 chips in a small hot dog basket. The salsa was very good and we ordered seconds which we received quickly.   Drinks were a beer and piña-colada which were good. We tried to order a skinny margarita but were told it included soda, agave, tequila and standard margarita mix which isn't \"skinny\" so we passed. I'm not sure that the waitress understood what the bartender told her so we'll let that go.   We ordered the fiesta burrito and the Mexicana burrito. The portions are very large and are a good price for the size. Both had skirt steak which was overcooked and a bit dry and smothered in sauce. Two of us liked the mildly spicy sauce and one thought it could be hotter. Rice and beans were fine. The burritos were okay.   We also ordered the seafood salad with the dressing on the side. What came was a plate of romaine lettuce with a lot of plain shrimp and 5 pieces of krab on top. There was no skimping on the amount of shrimp and they were big! But they still had the tails on so we had to take the time to shell the tails off each one before it could be eaten. When I asked the waitress for the dressing she first said it didn't come with any. When I pressed her that the menu said it came with a spicy ranch, she returned and said they were out. I ordered a side of guacamole to help with the bland taste but it was very bland too and I had to add salt and lime juice! The salad had no taste and was more like a shrimp cocktail on a bed of romaine with no cocktail sauce. I would not recommend it. It had absolutely no taste.   The waitress was friendly and checked on us but nothing that would bring us back. We hope some of the issues are because it just opened but due to the collaboration of everything, will stick to our other two Mexican restaurants nearby. Bummer."}
{"text":"Very bland....you have to be \"seated\" at bar...:our 3 item combo cost extra 4 buck...2.00 for a scoop of sour cream 2 bucks for a scoop of guacamole....:almost 20 bucks for it! Rip off!!! Don't bother..go to manuals by majerles or mannys  by lighthouse better bang and taste for your money..:."}
{"text":"By far, my favorite Mexican restaurant. Their chips and salsa are great! Drinks are great! Food is great! And service is great!"}
{"text":"Thought I'd give this place a try. Sometimes you just never know. Could have been a diamond in the rough. Sadly it was not. I tried the three item combo. Chicken enchilada, shredded beef burrito, ground beef taco. It came with rice and beans. The shredded beef was actually good but the rest was just below average. The beans were just plain bad. The service was good and the staff was attentive. Chips and salsa tasted like they were prepackaged."}
{"text":"This place is actually pretty good.  Never had a bad meal here whatsoever, and the waiting staff understands families and kids' needs! Love their rellenos."}
{"text":"Server was very patient and friendly food was nice and hot definitly recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit and a very good one as well. The decor is fun and bright. We were seated promptly and ordered a big margarita which was better than most that I have had around town. The wait staff was very good and quick to make sure we had chips/salsa and our order. The salsa was pretty good and the food was delicious, anyone who says it's bland is being indifferent on purpose. Price was reasonable and we will be back soon."}
{"text":"Good food and a very fun atmosphere. We eat here often and most of the time served is good. On weekends they have live Mexican music."}
{"text":"Love Mexican food and not being from area, always nervous about new places. This place was delicious, fast and good sized portions! I love having leftovers for the next day!! Lol"}
{"text":"My favorite sit-down Mexican place in town! Delicious food and always great and friendly service! Do yourself a favor and try the nachos."}
{"text":"We had a great meal there last night!  I had the Super Burrito and my wife had enchiladas.  Neither of us could finish our meals and we took leftovers for later.  The food was very good!"}
{"text":"This is my family's go-to Mexican restaurant. The servers are always very quick, very nice, and attentive to our needs. The chips and salsa served when you sit are fresh and bursting with flavor.  This is the only place in town where I can find pollo con mole, and let me tell you, it does not disappoint. Portions are generous, and the tortillas accompanying every meal are fresh and hot.  We eat here regularly and will not be changing that anytime soon. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant as a last minute decision and now I wish I would have traveled further up the road. First of all, we had to wait 40min for our take out order. As an emergency responder this could mean not being able to eat for a few hours. Second, the food was very sub par. The meat was flavorless, the food was to salty, the red sauce was basically salsa, and above all, the service was not good. Not once during the 40 minute wait were we ever offered a beverage. Definitely one of the worst food experiences in a long time."}
{"text":"We really wanted some good southwestern food. The ambience here is wonderful. Service is great! good food.  Not outstanding. Salsas good. Little mild. We had the steak and shrimp fajitas and shredded beef and enChilada.  Wonderful happy hour. 250 beers and appetizer and tropical drink specials. The best sopapillas I've ever had! Yummy. Fresh hot and big puff like a beigne from New Orleans.  Only covered with sugar and honey with whip cream on the side."}
{"text":"My birthday was spoiled by this place. We were there feb 9 for dinner husband, daughter, son, grandkids. Everywhere we go husband gets military discount off the total check. NOT in this place. They only discounted for husband meal ONLY. We gave the waiter $5.00 coupon that was NOT discounted either. When I told the waiter about the coupon he said that only one discount could be applied that was in the check only showed $1.23 military discount. I got upset because if that was the case, why they did no return the coupon to me? While I was taken care of this, the rest of the family were waiting for me outside the restaurant. When I finally came out my son told me that had embarrassed him. People should really pay attention to checks!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Super Burrito with shredded beef and was not disappointed! The plate is big enough to share between two people for sure. I had the sopapillas for dessert and even though they were good, they weren't what I was expecting. I was expecting New Mexican-style sopapillas with honey. The ones served here are covered in sugar, similar to a churro. Service was outstanding! Roberto was really attentive and that made our experience that much better. I would come back and I would recommend."}
{"text":"Tonight I visited Fiesta Mexicana for the first time and it was SO authentic. The food was GREAT and the service was EXCELLENT. I had the server Ken and I fell in love with his great personality and his care for his customers. Keep up the good work!!"}
{"text":"Si eres Mexicano y visitas Arizona o tienes poco tiempo de mudarte aquí, definitivamente no visites este lugar o te llevarás una grande decepción como yo... pedimos enchiladas suizas y cajitas de pollo, las enchiladas suizas en primer lugar no eran suizas eran solo enchiladas verdes con un pollo desagradable y como las pedimos extra de huevo (cada huevo 1.50 dólares xD) no le pusieron crema, a ps nuestra meserita nos cobro extra la crema. Las fajitas olian deliciosas, pero el pollo estaba más desabrido q nada. Le doy una estrella por q me gustaron las margaritas y las tortillas de harina me recordaron a Monterrey, pero definitivamente los restaurantes mexicanos en el extranjero son un asco :/ ... por cierto las banderitas q bones en la comida están de cabeza"}
{"text":"Outstanding, authentic food and friendly service. Margaritas were super! We will be back."}
{"text":"We were excited to try it. Saw some good reviews. We should have saved our money. We didn't even finish it. Paid our bill then went home and made dinner. SO disappointed. This is literally walking distance from home and we will never go back. There are so many options for Mexican food here we can get way better and at more affordable prices."}
{"text":"One word. Wow. So my husband and I, and my son with his life partner walked in and were greeted with the sweet aroma of salsa and chips. We were quickly escorted to a beautiful table and given drinks within two minutes. The food was piping hot and delicious. Ayyyyyy mama!!!!!! Get the burrito fiesta!!!!!! It's delish. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"My husband and I absolutely love this restaurant and have been going once a week for a couple of years now! The food is good and the service is great (especially Reuben!) and I've never had a bad meal here. I would like to know if there are any gluten free options as I have recently had to go GF. If so, this would help us keeping up our weekly visits."}
{"text":"This restaurant is gorgeous.  It shines, and everything was perfect.  The food was great, the Margaritas were huge, just like we wanted!  The servers were wonderful and very welcoming.  The manager came over to introduce himself and to make sure we got everything just the way it was ordered.   I've even taken out orders from here.  I can't complain about anything.  All restaurants have learning to do about the new area and clientele.  I hope this restaurant is around forever.  It is very inviting."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food! Fresh and hot! The chips are delicious as well. Service was very kind and fast."}
{"text":"Usually love this place,  but not tonight.  The service was the worst we have ever had anywhere. Had to get the manager involved. Hopefully this guys gets it right. When the food comes out it's good you just have to pray you get the right guy serving you. We'll come back but if I see this waiter I'll be asking for someone different."}
{"text":"Not sure why so many negative reviews were given as we really like this place. The service was great, fast and friendly. The food was really both times I have been. Love the decor, it reminds me of being in a Cali Mexican restaurant. We will for sure be back :)"}
{"text":"horribly disappointing our food arrived an hour after we ordered. It was cold. it did not resemble any \"authentic mexican food\" 8 have ever had. We will not return."}
{"text":"Come for the margaritas!  Stay for a decent meal with good portions. We first came here about a month ago, and then revisited to bring family from out of town.   My overall impression of the food is that it is good.  Not a profound statement, but nothing truly stood out as being either awesome, but nothing was bad.  It's typical Americanized Mexican that is competently done, with portions that you would expect...boxes might be brought home.  I have not found a dish with any super fresh-tasting bright ingredients, but the flavor is done well enough that I'm not turned off either.    The service was great both times.  We had wait staff who were very friendly, anticipated our needs, and definitely earned their tips for the hard work they do.  The food was hot & promptly served (no evidence of heat lamp stagnation), and the complementary chips & salsa were good.    Back to the margaritas...they make them strong with a good balance of the sweet and sour.  Thankfully, I'm within walking distance of this place should I drink 2 too fast.  :-)   Cheers..."}
{"text":"I stopped by here this past Wednesday night as part of a party of 6 for dinner.  Two member of our party were already at the restaurant whenever we got there and so we immediately proceeded to our table. Since it was near the doorway I can't say that i got to see too much of the restaurant but what I did, wow.  It had colorful paintings everywhere including the tabletops, walls, booths and even the chairs.  Our specific table had a scene which seemed to have a fair number of devil like items on it which I thought was interesting.  Since it was October, Fiesta Mexicana was also all decorated for Halloween and had up a variety of things.  Whenever we arrived to the table there was already some tortilla chips and nachos out on the table.  The tortilla chips themselves seemed your standard tortilla chips but the salsa was quite good!  It had a kick I often don't get in restaurant salsas and so I ended up  eating more tortilla chips than I should have just to eat more salsa.  Then for dinner on this evening I ordered the Camerones con arroz.  The menu described it as Prawns and mushrooms in a very special sauce (No beans).  Whenever it came the plate looked absolutely huge with rice on one side of the dish and the prawns, mushrooms and sauce on the other.  It ended up being delicious as the sauce was a little spicy with the perfect amount of creaminess on it.  It really paired nicely with the earthiness of the mushrooms and the sweetness of the perfectly cooked shrimp.   I actually enjoyed it so much that whenever I had finished it I pushed the rest of my rice into it so that I could sip up what was left.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  I thought that restaurant itself was a pretty colorful place, our service was great and the food was good also."}
{"text":"Big disappointment. My husband and I were there this past Saturday night.  The food was riduculously expensive, and the ambiance and quality of the restaurant did not warrant the cost.  We won't be back.  Weird lighting, we chose to sit on the patio, because the interior of the restaurant was almost painfully bright, think hurt your eyes bright.  Conversely, the patio, which is contiguous to the parking lot had a few bulbs burned out, and even though they had 2 fireplaces, neither were lit.  We felt like we were sitting in the dark, in a parking lot, which of course, we were.  If the fireplaces were lit, and they had more screening from the parking lot, and the bulbs had been replaced, it could have been nice."}
{"text":"I had the shrimp fajitas and it was really good. A tad bit pricey for 5 shrimps. Needed more bell peppers. Overall it was tastey. Pricey place to eat. But worth it. I think it's the best Mexican food in the West Valley"}
{"text":"I like coming to this place for my Mexican food fix. While the atmosphere feels like a chain, the food tastes homemade. They also do a 15% off discount for military in uniform. The staff also made you feel welcomed right away."}
{"text":"Excellent mocajete, filled with jalapeños, nopales, shrimp, chicken, chorizo, and steak cooked to order! Service was courteous and fast."}
{"text":"Excellent Food and Excellent Service! We recommend the Sauza margarita!"}
{"text":"Super bomb dot com... food is awesome and customer service is great I love it... it's my new favorite place."}
{"text":"This place is very good. Great margaritas, colorful decor, mariachi band and gigantic portions!  The band can be a little loud but overall we have had excellent service every time."}
{"text":"Really great food! Friendly staff, very attentive to our needs. The Queso and the Enchiladas are amazing! My husband had the super burrito and he's was a huge fan of it as well. Good family atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Guess they don't want customers. Dropped by no lights in inside open sign on waited 5min to be seated no one showed up"}
{"text":"This is the only good Mexican restaurant I've found so far since I moved into town. The art and decor of this restaurant is beyond beautiful.  I've tried the green and red shrimp enchiladas, pescado frito, wet burrito, and also the molcagete. Everytime I order something new im never dissapointed. If you're searching for a fine Mexican dining restaurant then this is the place to go.  Me and my family love this place. They honestly have great food, nice variety of alcohol and great customer service!"}
{"text":"Food was great!! Customer Service Fantastic  one of the best servers I have had (Anthony )"}
{"text":"I was debating between 3 stars or 4 stars, based on the food, Fiesta Mexicana is worth 4 stars. However, the service needs to be improved. First of all, there was no host or no server at the front, which was quite awkward, there was already a party waiting in front of us.. Also, we waited more than 25 minutes to get our Margaritas.   Regarding the food, they have a great lunch menu, prices are not excessive. I got the Pollo Asado and it was very tasty. The chicken was marinated and cooked over charcoal. The rice was very good as well. Did I mention that the plate was HUGE? For a lunch portion......   The decoration of the restaurant is very colorful, it brings an authentic vibe to the place! For once, they had music that belongs to this type of restaurant!   Overall it was a nice experience. Improve the service and i would definitively come back!"}
{"text":"Great service, chips and salsa are BOMB and it was very relaxed. Menu is very extensive so there are MANY options to choose from, which I like. This place is awesome"}
{"text":"Well I thought I had tried every Mexican place in the west valley.  But I had missed this little gem.  The decor is super gimmicky and almost like they are trying to hard to seem Mexican but the food needs no help.  I ordered the Pollo A La Crema and ooooh man was it awesome."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best authentic Mexican food we have had in a long time! Wonderful fresh avocados, pico and salsa! Rice tastes just like grandmas!  The waitstaff and hostess were excellent, warming smiles and highly efficient! We will most certainly be back!"}
{"text":"So glad we came to try this place! My Father owns a Mexican restaurant so I am naturally extra critical of Mexican restaurants. Fiesta Mexicana IS AMAZING, they did not disappoint one bit. I also want to mention how yummy the michelada was, I have been searching for a good michelada spot and I have finally found it. I will be  returning with family real soon."}
{"text":"Wow! I ordered the Steak Ranchero and received two T-Bone steaks! Awesome and delicious! Cathy our server was prompt, attentive, and friendly... With Malagueña playing in the background we couldn't have asked for a more wonderful experience. Highly recommend!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food is always fresh and outstanding. Love the complimentary chips and salsa. Me and the hubby's favorite date night spot."}
{"text":"The food and margaritas here are AWESOME!! The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it's little bit expensive in my opinion. The burrito verde is sooooo good!"}
{"text":"Always have had wonderful service.   The food is authentic and amazingly tasty. You can have it \"gringo\" all the way up to\"fire breather. \"  they are perfect for gatherings,  casual dinner and even take reservations.  They don't skimp on the portion sizes either.   Dessert is delish.  They serve Pepsi products but also have a full service bar."}
{"text":"This is the worst Mexican restaurant I've ever been to and I've been to many over the years! Ordered a shredded beef taco and cheese enchilada with rice and beans. The beef was tough and the enchilada left a lot to be desired. The margarita was strong and the flan was good but small. Would have had a better meal at Taco Bell!"}
{"text":"I think this place is way over rated on here. I like to try locally owned restaurants and I'm ok with less traditional food. But this place was not good. I ordered a shrimp dish, and the shrimp were like rubber they were so over cooked. My husband ordered a burrito that he wasn't a fan of either. The salsa was tasty (maybe bumping it up to a 1.5) but it might have been the stuff you buy in the refrigerated section at frys. The small things weren't their either. No water, no refills on chips and salsa unless you asked. Waaay overpriced too. $16+ for 3 draft xxbeers. They charged $6+ for 2 sides of pinto beans. Unfortunately we won't be going back, I was excited about a Mexican restaurant near out house too!"}
{"text":"Checked it out for a late meal and I was a bit surprised by how expensive it was. For sure need to go back during Happy Hour. The margaritas were very good. Ordered an amazing dip but it was really oily-but tasted good."}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant in town and in the valley. I literally go at least three times a month and I have never been disappointed. LOVE"}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere. Generous portion sizes. Food is very tasty. Music is fun and conversation level easy to keep. Servers are friendly. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Horrible food (the most dry taco I have ever eaten and the enchilada was very chewy) and awful service, not to mention a giant cockroach walked right past us  to nibble on a piece of meat on the floor.  They didnt get our order right and we ended up having to eat it anyway because the waiter never came back to the table, then we had to look for him to pay the bill and then again to get our credit card back.  When we showed the manager the giant cockroach he just picked it up with a napkin and didnt even offer an apology.  I give them 6 months at most and then they will be out of business."}
{"text":"Finally!!  A good Mexican restaurant on the Westside.  Don Pancho's is excellent but it's mostly take out with a few tables so we've been waiting for a nice Mexican restaurant for a long time now.  Especially coming from Ventura County where we had all sorts of choices of really good Mexican food.     First of all the decor is really pretty and colorful, and the restaurant is very open with good energy.  Our service was wonderful.  Salsa wasn't anything to write home about but the chips were super good.  I didn't think the salsa was spicy at all, but I do like things on the hotter side.    Ok, the beer.  It came in a positively frozen glass!  So awesome on a hot day to have a nice cold beer from the tap!  Our food was delicious.  The chicken in the taquitos was definitely cooked onsite; not some canned crap like you get from other Mexican restaurants.  I asked the server if we could have the taquitos cooked so the tortilla was a little browner than the picture on the menu and they did.   The mole is really good as well.  I thought the value was great.  I'm not sure what people expect nowadays from Mexican food.  It's just like Vegas.  Gone are the days where you could get a meal for $5.  Ok, we didn't order a whole lot of food so that's why I'm not giving it 5 stars.  I'll definitely be back to try the chile relleno and tamales though!"}
{"text":"Went there today to try it for the first time and was extremely disappointed! We walked in and there wasn't anyone at the front to seat us. That's fine we can wait for someone. HA! 4 different workers walked by the front, looked at us and didn't say a word! Not a simple hi, we'll be with you in a second, NOTHING! It was a good 5 minutes until we finally decided to leave. It wasn't even that packed. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"1st timer today for my birthday. Really good flavorful food!  Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"The establishment is gorgeous!  Very colorful and clean. The women's restrooms are clean as well. The food was average.  Which made me sad because I was expecting the food to match the decor.  I ordered the carne asada with rice and beans.  The rice and beans were very good. Nice flavor and not over cooked. The carne, was bland. There was no flavor, literally.  I have eaten plenty of carne and I'm pretty sure this is not what it is supposed to taste like. That being said, the mariachi's were a nice touch and our server was attentive and professional.  I would come back one more time to try another dish and a margarita. I also tried a bite or two of my mother's plate, chicken mole. I thought it was tasty, but my mom thought it was too sweet. The sopapilla was okay, not that it was bad. I like my sopapilla with confectioners sugar and honey only.  It tasted like they added some extra ingredients."}
{"text":"It's not horrible, but it's just not that great. Honestly, you'll get better flavor at Federico's."}
{"text":"The only reason why I gave this restaurant 2 stars is because the food was decent. The service could not have been worse. It took us 20 minutes to get our drinks, and that's when he finally took our food order. The food took 25 minutes to come out. We went for Father's Day, but it wasn't busy. The workers were too busy watching the NBA finals than attending to the customers. When we asked the manager about the horrible service, he did nothing but gave us 1/2 off our lowest priced entree. He didn't even apologize or offer an explanation. Horrible, horrible business that we will never return to. Nando's food is just as good, if not better, with amazing service. Go there instead."}
{"text":"Festive Mexican atmosphere with good apps and margaritas for Happy Hour. Leave a review on Yelp and get a free sopapilla!"}
{"text":"I would like to first off give credit to our waiter that was really nice and attentive,  and he is NOT the reason I give this restaurant 2 stars.    This place is by far the worse Mexican Restaurant I've ever been to. The food was spiced up way too much , and every meal ordered was drenched in grease. They had 1 cook making the food for the whole restaurant on a Saturday!  Our meals took 45 minutes til they got served, and we didn't even get an apology from the manager. No wonder they only receive a 3 star overall rating."}
{"text":"Went in on Wednesday night about 530 and the place was really crowded. Had a draft beer and an ice water the waitress was fast and very helpful.  The chips and salsa were brought right away the chip basket was very small but refilled upon request with no problems. The chips were pretty generic nothing to write home about. We're not big eaters so we ordered the appetizer platter ($12.95) which consisted of nachos quesadilla and taquitos. She asked us for our meat choice and apparently you could get beef or chicken or pork on 1, 2 or all three of the choices. We opted for shredded beef on all three. The platter had lots of shredded beef and totally filled us up. We noticed another diner had a fried fish or pescado entree that looked really good and since my wife's Asian will probably go back and try that. Nothing special about this place that would bring us back. Nearby Nandos is still our favorite.  I gave it three stars because there was nothing wrong with our meal but nothing outstanding either."}
{"text":"The food Not good at all and price not worthy, Federico's or Eriberto's have better taste food restaurants"}
{"text":"We went for Mother's Day and splurged on a Cadillac margarita. It was excellent!  Above my usual price range, but it was great!! We had Taco salads with shredded beef and they were tasty. I loved their salsa. Service was prompt and friendly!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"We're back, the food is really authentic here! Beer and great wine choices on tap and bottled. A free dessert when you check in. Thank you!"}
{"text":"The food is OK but the customer service is terrible. My wife ordered a red Margarita and I tasted it and it had no liquor in it. So if you order a liquor drink make sure it has liquor in it."}
{"text":"Came here on a recommendation and was hoping I would be leaving a 5 star or even a 3 star but it came to this disappointing 1 star and that is only because the waiter was trying his hardest even though he was waiting and clearing tables. First thing that should have made me get up and walk out was the burnt tasting salsa, it looked good and smelled good just had this awful burnt taste to it plus needed a bit of salt. Now for the food I ordered a 3 item combo with rice and beans which I got. It was a enchilada, chimichanga, and a taco all shredded beef. Now I don't claim to be an expert on Mexican food even though I am Mexican but this food seemed to be geared more to a gringos taste buds. Meat tasted like it was from a can, enchilada sauce had no spice to it and I didn't even eat the taco. Rice was ok not bad but not good either and beans was the typical canned beans. Only thing I liked from this place was the horchata which I think was from The fountain as it reminded me of the one you can get from am/pm.....Sign out side says authentic Mexican food ...... Wonder if it was a left over sign from a previous restaurant...."}
{"text":"Wow! What a great find!  The margaritas are outstanding (and I've sampled quite a few margaritas over the past five years that I've lived in the West Valley). And even though I ordered mine (2) at Happy Hour prices, the bartender didn't skimp on the tequila.  On to the food. I don't usually like Mexican food (which begs the question, \"Why did I retire from Pennsylvania to Arizona?\"), but I absolutely LOVED the Queso Fundido. The mushrooms and peppers were sautéed to perfection, the beef was not dry, and the cheese was melted perfectly. My only complaint was that I asked for sour cream and was charged and extra $1.29 for it. Oh, well.  And the food was plentiful. In fact, I should have ordered the appetizer rather than the full plate.  I ate here on a Thursday night with nine other friends. Within 30 seconds of our being seated, our drink orders were taken and we were served two huge plates of nachos and salsa. The salsa was fantastic; it must be homemade.   Our server was excellent!!! Our dinners came out in a timely manner, and none of us ever had to wait an undue amount of time for anything. Our separate checks included an 18% gratuity because we were a large group, but I added another 4%, as did several of my friends.  I can't wait to take out-of-town guests to this restaurant.   Wish I had taken pictures, but I was too busy enjoying!"}
{"text":"It is good food but a little pricey. Good drinks but the chips could be a little better."}
{"text":"I'd heard really good things about this place, so we decided to head over there and check it out.  The atmosphere is fun and colorful.  Plus, the wait staff all seem very friendly.  I must say this first, I don't like things too hot (as in spicy), so I'm very particular about my Mexican restaurants.   When we were seated, we were given a very small bowl of chips and some salsa.  My hubby tried the salsa first, and deemed it too hot for me.  So, as I like to do, I asked for a side of guacamole...I prefer that anyway.  When it came, it looked decent, but also had a strong heat factor.  I truly wanted to like it, but could only manage about 2 bites.  We ordered an appetizer of chicken taquitos.  When they arrived, we devoured them!  They were delicious!!  There wasn't much heat to them, but the flavor was so wonderful.  Honestly, I would order that as my main dish, if we ever decide to go back again.  Then came our entrees...hubby got cheese/onion enchiladas.  He enjoyed them a lot.  His only complaint was that there were too many raw onions, but it didn't deter him from cleaning his plate.  I got the carne asada.  The flavor of the skirt steak was wonderful, and the grilling of the meat was good.  My only issue was that it was so chewy.  I've had lots of skirt steak in my life, and when it's done really well, it can melt in your mouth.  We left there about 2 hours ago, and I still feel like I'm chewing some of it.  We decided to end the meal with something sweet, so on our waiter's recommendation, we got the flan.  It was quite tasty, but a little dense.  I'm not saying it wasn't good, but it didn't have that light airy feel to it.  All in all, it was a decent meal.  I'm not sure whether I'd want to go back, or not.  But, if we did, I'd really want to get those chicken taquitos!!"}
{"text":"Good service, good food and good margaritas. Extensive menus options. With nice interior and fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"This has been an incredible dining experience for myself and my fiancé. Great drinks, awesome food, reasonable prices, but above and beyond was the service by our server Ken. Everything was served quickly and with a smile and a conversation and I really think it deservs 5 stars plus. We will 100% be coming back again and again.  Edited 11/8/17. Been sitting on patio for half hour, one poor hostess brought us chips and salsa but we have not even placed our food order yet. Starving and figured we'd get good service... almost ready to just pay for our chips and salsa and leace  Again 1/13/18 how the mighty have fallen. How this place went from such a great restaurant, to what it's become this quickly is shocking. Will not spend another dime here again. Tried it five times after the initial poor experience, at this point I'd rather burn $60 than waste it here and still have to pay to eat somewhere afterwards. It's very disappointing to say the least."}
{"text":"This is our fourth time here and we love it! We have tried multiple items on the menu and everything has been impressive. This is quickly becoming our family favorite restaurant. It is not easy to find a Mexican restaurant that lives up to your expectations. If you're tired of Macayos then try this spot out, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Overpriced and the food wasn't anything spectacular. I had the chicken enchiladas and burrito special. The beans were bland and the rice was terrible tasted fake. Like something in a package. Unfortunately we won't come back. However the menudo was delicious. 10.00 for a bowl and they didn't have a child bowl so my 7 year old was stuck eating a giant bowl."}
{"text":"Would be nice if someone would answer the phone. Called to ask a few things and got either a busy tone or automated message over the course of about 30 minutes of trying."}
{"text":"Perfect every time I go.. Love this place, love the food! I appreciate the quick service and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Omg. We are Mexican food snobs, and we just found our spot! It is a bit far from us, but well worth it. I can't even explain. So good! If you like real Mexican food, go here. And not overpriced either. Yum yum yum So much flavor!"}
{"text":"Great salsa, great drinks, our server Sylvester was great. I love the tampiquena plate, steak with shrimp and cheese. The chicken tampiquena is also very good with chicken breast rolled up in bacon and covered with a wonderful white sauce, peppers and onions."}
{"text":"Not the best food I've ever had, but pretty good for the area.   We stopped by for lunch and at first I was overwhelmed with the amount of choices, it's a pretty big menu. I ordered a chimicanga and it was very strange. Not crispy like you'd normally expect.   My husband ordered the Fajita burro and it was very yummy. HUGE portion, easily sharable (in fact that's what we'll do next time.  Margarita was tasty (not the best, but what you'd expect)."}
{"text":"They accommodated my entire work staff for lunch with no wait. All 10 of us (mostly Hispanic women) enjoyed our Friday lunch.  Great options and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Having been born and raised in Arizona I like to think I'm a pretty good judge of tasty and authentic Mexican food. If that's what you're looking for this place has it. I was able to taste test some other menu items from my cousin's plate too and was extremely impressed. I had the single item combo Shredded Beef Chimichanga with rice and beans and guacamole. YUmmmmY!!!!! Will be coming back! They even have a live mariachi band playing. Not sure if this is only a weekend thing but the whole experience was awesome and the server was fantastic as well. Highly recommend. Price was fair too. Oh and the salsa was super flavorful. The chips were a little on the thick side but minor detail. Overall it was all delicious."}
{"text":"The service was excellent and the food was very good.Authentic not your imitation Mexican food."}
{"text":"Decent food but way overpriced,  unfortunately.   Great ambiance.  Very nice decor.   No lunch menu with lower pricing, which is probably why it was pretty empty for a Saturday."}
{"text":"Was here last week and realized when driving by forgot to praise the awesome place.   I had some fish dish, can't recall name, but it was yummy.  Personal preference, I don't like getting a whole fish and tearing it apart.  Not their fault and I didn't know, but it was still really good, so was the rice that came with it.   Friend got a combo burrito, I think, I just know that it had tons of stuff in it and they really liked it.   With th mariachi band, it added flare.   Would go here again."}
{"text":"WOW! From the moment you enter, your soul will come alive with the vibrantly decorated restaurant and bright cheery colors. You'll feel as if you're in Mexico enjoying the best award winning margaritas and passionate flavors from the chef. Kevin the GM is right on point with each and every guest he greets. It's a must try and when you do, you'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The wife and I went here last night and the food and drinks were amazing. I had my usual Mexican food beer, miller lite, but she ordered the coconut margarita. That thing was awesome. All I can say is WOW! We also had the fajitas for two. We did shrimp and steak. The food came out piping hot and was delicious all the way to the last bite. They also had mariachi guys playing some good tunes and the atmosphere there was as good as south of the border. Overall a great experience."}
{"text":"We were sorely disappointed with this restaurant and will not be back!  The enchilada sauce tasted just like the can it came out of!  The burrito was a sad piece of soggy tortilla with a skimpy amount of beans and cheese.  The cheese enchiladas were okay but again the sauce was not authentic and not good!  The chips came in a hot dog dish without even a piece of wax paper between them and the basket.  The table wasn't clean when we got there and when I asked for the last patron's remnants to be wiped off, the person who seated us came back with a napkin which of course did not sufficiently clean the table.  And who, in this day and age, charges for refills?  A restaurant that does not expect repeat business, that's who!  The only reason we are giving them a second star is because the live mariachi band was indeed entertaining and our server was attentive.  The food... forget it!"}
{"text":"I had just visited Mexico a week before visiting this restaurant and I must say, it is pretty authentic taste! The restaurant is spacious with adorable Mexican decor that makes you feel as if you're really in Mexico. I came with a party of 5 at around 2pm and the place was pretty full. However, our server was super friendly and attentive to our needs. Our requests came out quickly and so did our food. Restaurant gives complimentary chips and salsa. The food here is totally worth the money, humongous portions and delicious. For appetizers, we shared the deluxe nachos. They gave us a generous amount and we were all nearly full by the time we finished. I got the fish tacos, which came with 3 huge tacos in tortilla, rice, beans, salad, and a generous amount of guacamole. The rice and beans were so good I cleared my plate. The fish tacos were perfectly seasoned. My friends got the al pastor and the skirt steak tacos, both were good, but I preferred the skirt steak. We also had a Mexican burrito which was big enough for two people. I'm usually not a fan of burritos but the steak was cooked perfectly, super tender. I was too full to notice my Yelp deal but checking in gives you a free dessert, I saw fried cheesecake and fried ice cream on the menu that I didn't get to try but don't make the same mistake as me and get yours!!! Overall, great atmosphere, good service, really good food! I loved how they were generous with guacamole on every entree and didn't charge extra like most places do. Highly recommended :)"}
{"text":"Second visit here. The chips and salsa are very good. I filled up on them and they kept them and the salsa coming. Can't go wrong with the appetizer combo plate. I got it the first time I came here,  and got it again. It's big enough to fill you up. The food is yummy.   My problem is with the music. Music should be subtle and ambient. I get that they are sticking to the Mexican theme with their music. But enough already do I really need to be rattled out of my seat by tubas, and squeeze box Oompa-Loompa bands?   Turn the volume down let the music be in the back ground.  It's a restaurant, not a night club. I couldn't eat all my food the music was that loud and that bad, it turned my appetite.  I seriously wanted to walk outside and throw my body under a passing bus.   Next time I'll order and eat it out on the curb on Dysart road, you can hear it from there but it's not blaring and you don't have to yell at your dinner date to be heard.   Oompa, Loompa, doom-pa-dee-da!"}
{"text":"Best food i've had in a long time! Big menu, entrees come out quickly and there is unlimited chips and salsa. Also affordable for all the food you get."}
{"text":"Our favorite Mexican restaurant in AZ. They have the best margaritas and the food and service is excellent. We don't go anywhere else and we come here weekly."}
{"text":"Really good chile verde, rice, and chile relleno. Service is a little iffy, so gotta go in with a little patience."}
{"text":"It is refreshing to see a restaurant make use of the small things to make a big impact.   Fiesta Mexicana has a large varied menu with above average food, great salsa but more important an atmosphere full of color and life.  The wait staff look sharp in their uniform attire, and our waiter was professional and attentive.  The surroundings were very clean, pleasing being artfully colorful and bright, without going overboard.  Music was pleasant without being too loud so we could also enjoy conversing with one another at the table.  My wife said her margarita was fantastic.  The food looked great and even the plates were nice!  Prices were maybe a bit higher than average, but when you want quality food, service and atmosphere you at least get more than you pay for at La Fiesta."}
{"text":"Best service and food I've had in a long time. Angel was our server Friday night and was amazing. I highly recommend this place based on our first experience. All staff was super nice and super quick!"}
{"text":"This is my 3rd visit here and so far I'm happy with this place. Service is top notch food is pretty close to authentic. Chips and salsa are good! Dessert was good but the churro would have been even better nice and hot paired with some vanilla ice cream instead of whipped cream. Overall, the atmosphere is nice for big or small parties. This is one of the best Mexican food spots to be in this area. I'll definitely keep coming here."}
{"text":"Extensive menu excellent Service Great salsa were locals and we're coming back probably at least once a month we love this place!"}
{"text":"I have came here in the past and really enjoyed the food and service however today was lacking. Not sure what the deal was. Also the prices seemed a bit higher than I remember I mean $2.50 for a side of Avacado and $1.89 for a side of sour cream...... don't think we will be back for quite some time."}
{"text":"Fast service and a great happy hour. Good food. A little pricey, but big portions.  Amazing margaritas!"}
{"text":"Not for large groups. We didn't get half of our drinks. Asked several times. We asked several times for silverware. We ended up getting it ourselves. Our food order was all wrong. Half of our group didn't get what they ordered. Good for those who got theirs right. Women's restroom had no toilet paper and no paper towels. While some in my group may go back, I will not."}
{"text":"Excellent management and staff. Very helpful and friendly. Food and drinks where very delicious. Our new  favorite Mexican restuarant even though it's a little drive for us. Keep up the great work"}
{"text":"Great Mexican restaurant for St Patrick's day. Good food and very good margaritas! Friendly staff and great atmosphere too!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious!!! It took forever to get to us though or I would have given 5 stars. They also did a chicken flauta instead of the beef I ordered, but it was so good I didn't mind."}
{"text":"Back again and still wonderful. Nice to know we can count on a very tasty mexican meal with fantastic,  friendly staff."}
{"text":"Good food, a tad pricey. I had the Chicken Pablano at the recommendation of our server and it was very tasty."}
{"text":"I always love taking the family here. We especially like the micheladas and seafood cocktail. It's a great combination."}
{"text":"This place is a joke and one star is being generous.   The food was very mediocre, the service was horrible, the restaurant look worn and dirty.  I would be surprised if they were open in a year.  we came in around 4pm,  there was only a few tables and still never got refills on drinks.  Not one person in our party had any thing good to say about there food. and each of us came to the conclusion we would not be back."}
{"text":"Love this place! It has excellent service and if you're looking for real authentic Mexican food this is the place to go to. There is ample seating so even if there is a wait it shouldn't be too long. We were told fifteen minutes and only waited maybe 2!"}
{"text":"The service we received was poor and these are the reason; when you give your customers their drinks and chips don't place them behind the customers, when your drink is half full ask your customers \"is there anyrhing else I can get for you\", in addition bartenders should not be tossing ice to each other when they are bored... We did ask for the manager, but I think it was his cousin or brother  wearing a maroon tshirt. He did not offer apologizes and when the the bartender was confronted how items were served he mubbled Ugh!!, which we heard and we told him it's about the makings customers happy and giving the customers what they need.  Two stars for the good drinks."}
{"text":"Another Mexican restaurant bites the dust. If it wasn't for our waitress Gigi it would get 1 star. Coming from Chicago, which has fantastic authentic Mexican food, I'm so surprised with the lack of quality Mexican food in Arizona. Carne Asada had absolutely no flavor, a little salt at least would have been nice. House margarita tasted like Hi c with a dash of tequila. This place caters to people who have no idea what authentic Mexican food taste like. Decor was obnoxious. We spent over $85 for 4 margaritas and two entrees. I had high hopes for this place and was absolutely disappointed. Again, Gigi our waitress was attentive and very pleasant. Better food at any taco bell you could find. Don't waste your time and money."}
{"text":"Well, we stopped in for appetizers and a Cactus  Margarita last week. We had a sampler with a pretty big variety of appetizers. It was good. The Margarita was good and our waiter was really nice. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Good food with a twist on the traditional Sonoran or Baja style we usually get around town.  If you love seafood, this is your place."}
{"text":"Ok first time here search on Google while me and my wife was out and about. Had best reviews and went. AWESOME! I had the tries combo chimi taco enchilada rice and beans. So good. My wife had some green chili something however she said it was excellent. I'm a Mexican food guy and is my favorite food El numra Uno. If your in the area or want to make the drive go. PS had house margaritas and very large and mucho excellentta. This is your Mexican food expert and I will be back. Stay single my friends and wedding cake will kill you! P.S. Forgot Anna our server was awesome! Excellent job Anna."}
{"text":"The food is so awesome here! My husband and I eat here as often as we can (as often our waistline allows). The staff is always so welcoming and friendly! The margaritas are the bomb! If you have a chance try it for yourself! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place....I really did!    It's the 3rd restaurant in this space in the 11 years we've lived in the area.  A fresh, bright and colorful interior change was so welcoming as was the 'full house' on our first visit.  The service was 'ok'....I cut them some slack because of it being a very busy night and the place being fairly new.  However, our waitress chose to stand and talk to the table next to us telling them about her life, rather than complete our order. The first bit of food arrived - nothing to brag about. Our entrees arrived and were kind of tossed onto the plate.  Mine was barely warm (I am a stickler for hot food being served hot - don't just warm the plate and call it acceptable).  We decided we'd give it a try another time. The second visit was similar to the first, except that there wasn't a large crowd, there were empty tables and yet we had about a 20 minute wait.  We sat at the end of the bar where servers were constantly coming up to get drinks for customers.   A big annoying. The food service wasn't prompt nor accurate and once again, the plates were slopped up with food and sauce, barely warm and noting to brag about. I won't go back.  I give it a couple of months longer and they too will close their doors. If I had to guess, I would say most of the food is prepared ahead of time so it's not really 'fresh'.   Nothing is loaded with flavors...pretty bland and boring The location is fantastic!   Lots of homes around the area...a mixed crowd of young families and a senior community.   Seniors go out to eat and we like places close to home!!! !"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in the valley, and the Margaritas are the best!  They have a regular customer in me I just walked in on a drive by and my mind was blown.  Check this restaurant out you will not be disappointed get the Cadillac Margarita.  The staff was courteous and attentive please check them out."}
{"text":"I eat Mexican food way too much, I'm half Mexican and grew up eating great Mexican food at home and out. A lot. Still one of my favorite things to eat - with that as a qualifier, for solid old school Sonoran Mexican food - this place Rocks! Menu selections are HUGE, with many mariscos options that you don't normally don't find in the Valley. I got the red chili chimi and chicken sopita combo, and it was might tastily devoured. Wife loved her ceviche and we all enjoyed the beans and fresh salsa (both key to measure the quality of a Mexican restaurant).  Now admittedly we came early for dinner (5ish), but service was perfect: friendly, timely, attentive even when we made some requests. I am very happy we came - as some of these reviews almost made us pass - now I can't wait to bring my parents, who will certainly love this place that reminds them of our family food. Prices are fair for the area and setting is really cute traditional. A great place, we're sure to visit again!"}
{"text":"Not expecting Fiesta Mexicana to last long despite our neighborhood's need for some restaurants. The food is bland and the service matches. We've tried it twice and both times were a mistake. Once we ate in and the other was take out. Take out was a disaster with cold food, much smaller portions than if you dine in, no tortillas with fajitas because evidently they decided  'the tortillas just get soggy when you take them home so we just don't bother sending them'.   Both times 6 meals were purchased and none of them were worth the trip or cost."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. I had a really nice shredded beef burrito. Sauce was wonderful and I'm not a sauce person."}
{"text":"ok service was ok not as bad as other experienced but not the best Ive had.  Had Beef Taco, tamale, cheese enchilada, rice and beans.  Taco was good despite it was a 'pre made' shell not my favorite and it wasnt shredded it was ground beef but was good.  Tamale was fantastic. enchilada so so. rice was  very good and beans were good not the best but good.    Salsa was very good had a little kick to it  and I believe made with roasted chilli's  chips were fresh and very good.  Will I go back  not likely  we have great choices for mex in the area, maybe it I had a coupon or they had a lunch special."}
{"text":"Terrible! Don't waste your time (we waited over 45 minutes for our food) and your money (overpriced). When the waitress finally showed up we ordered margaritas. It tasted OK but barely had any ice (rocks) to keep the drink cold. We ordered chicken fajitas, a kids meal with chicken strips and fries. The fajitas were so over cooked that the onions were black, charred and petrified. The chicken I could have put a dent in a wall if I threw it and the rice and beans weren't even warm. Assuming the microwave was broken! Now for the kids meal.. How do you mess that up? The strips were almost black they were so over fried, AND neither the fries or the chicken was even warm .. COLD AGAIN.... It gets worse from there. When we told the waitress about the food she apologized  and said that they are so busy and that so many things were broken in the kitchen and that we were even lucky to get our food when we did as orders were so backed up. We never saw a manager coming around to see how things were. Especially given the fact that it is a new restaurant you'd think you would see a manager. Our waitress offered to send he food back but after waiting 45 for food, we just wanted to leave. We paid our $50 tab we left and will never be back!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here, I lived in Arizona for 11 years and I wish I head doing you guys sooner.  Service was great, Nancy did an amazing job explaining the menu and making sure we had everything we needed."}
{"text":"Everything here was pretty great... The service was awesome! Chips & salsa tasty and chips were fresh and warm. Food came out at a good pace was good with big portions. Dessert was yummy! They offer military discount as well and all the employees are very polite! New favorite mexican place"}
{"text":"One of my favorites.  Love the impressive menu and the salsa is perfect...and of course the margaritas.  Very impressed with Eric, such a great server."}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican restaurants in the Chandler area, BUT, I was completely disappointed when I visited them this past Thursday and the waitress said they couldn't make crispy shrimp tacos for me.  Not only did she say they couldn't make them, she insisted they NEVER make them.  I beg to differ, as I was there in June and had the BEST shrimp taco plate I'd ever had (see photo)!  As a matter of fact, that shrimp taco plate was the reason I visited the restaurant again when I was in town.  Imagine my disappointment when my craving wasn't going to be satisfied.  Instead, I ended up with a very, very sad looking shrimp soft taco.  I'm still giving them a four star rating because the food and margs are excellent, they just need to get all of their chefs on board with the fact that they CAN make crispy shrimp tacos!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and I'd have to say the food is pretty good! And you get sooo much for so little!!  And they have Awesome, fast service. 5*!"}
{"text":"First time visit. Ordered Fajita burrito and it was horrible. The meat was tough, the red sauce tasted like marinara. Also order Enchilada Suizas and not good either. Green sauce was not good. Can't even explain what it tasted like. Never tasted Mexican food like this before. Just moved from CA and have yet to find good Mexican food in the west valley. The only good thing was chips, salsa and the beans. Will not be coming back. Way to expensive for bad Mexican food. Only giving 1 star since I can't chose 0 stars."}
{"text":"Probably the best place ive been to that makes amazing mexican food and the variety is amazing. Love!!"}
{"text":"Maybe it is because I am use to Tex Mex but I was not a fan. The queso was like powdered cheese with milk. The soft taco was not good. Still searching for good Mexican food in this city!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food on the westside!!!!!  They have the best staff, everyone goes out of their way to make your dining experience a great one.  Definitely worth giving them a try. Two thumbs up. Mucho Grande!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great people and atmosphere.  Coldest beer on draft and very tasty fajitas!  Must try if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Outstanding food! Our waiter Mario took care of us well. We ordered something in a volcano bowl with steak and shrimp and cactus that my husband and I shared. The margaritas rocked!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent service was fast and friendly plus the margarita wasn't bad at all waiter highly recommend this place! Ask for Ruben best server!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food and very quick service on Cinco de Mayo. I was very impressed with how quickly they handled the lines of patrons waiting. I made reservations online which they should not have taken . But since someone forgot to turn off the system, they honored our reservations.  Thats great customer service.  I had the fajitas mixtas and my girl friend had chicken fajitas . Both dishes came out piping hot and delicious. Our happy hour drinks were perfect and only 1 dollar each. Even the chips and salsa were perfect. The chips tasted fresh and not like they were sitting in warehouse for weeks.  The menu is extensive and should satisfy anyone looking for authentic and good mexican food. If i could give them 6 six stars. I would."}
{"text":"Chips: yup.  Salsa: yup.  Margs: yup.   And our server, Annette, was pretty cool.  12/10 will be coming back."}
{"text":"Good food and service. Our first time here from out of town. Nice find. Definitely will go back before we go back home."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  It is pretty typical fare I suppose but very good.  The portions are large, the drinks are reasonably priced, it is clean, and the people are friendly.  We've been a couple of times and have enjoyed it each time."}
{"text":"Update:  Ate here on a Friday night after 5:30. Immediately seated & drink order taken by our server Myra, who was on top of things while we were there. She was really outstanding, so thanks, Myra!  What we wish was outstanding was the food. DH ordered the shrimp enchiladas, while my stomach mandated the simpler cheese & onion enchiladas. When I asked DH how his meal was compared to the same meal at one of our favorite Mexican places, he said, \"If I had to say anything, it would be that these enchiladas are mediocre, at best.\" By the end of the meal, my really sensitive gut was complaining & DH's was uncomfortable. Not worth the pain. We won't be back."}
{"text":"The food and the service was great. We got the sampler and the combos. The food was authentic, I loved the beans and rice. Also, the water is goos tasting. Very pleased and we will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Best food and customer service! Our new go to place. Refilled chips, drinks, tortillas and salsa before we had to even ask. All with a smile :)"}
{"text":"This place has a wide variety of lunch specials that are a little less than $10, but if it weren't for the lunch specials then I would think their meals are a little pricey for what you get. I came here and got their carne asada lunch special, two chicken tacos and two chicken enchiladas and all were good but nothing special. They each came with rice and beans which I wish you were able to sub out for something else because none of us touched either. You do get a free dessert with a yelp check in, but you are only able to use it on the churros or sopapilla. We got the sopapilla which I'd never tried before, it was a piece of fried bread with cinnamon, caramel, and whipped cream and it was pretty tasty!! The service was also pretty slow and our meal came out to a little over $30 for three people but I felt like I ate the same portion I would have at a fast food Mexican food place where it'd be half the price."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. The atmosphere is cool and a little funky. You feel like your in Mexico. However, the food didn't impress me. I ordered the  beef enchiladas with rice and beans. The enchilada sauce tasted like it came from a can, bland and boring. The shredded beef was also a bit dry and they were skimpy with the cheese on top. Come on everyone likes their enchiladas oozing with cheese! Homemade enchilada sauce done the right way from scratch is so easy and a thousand times better and it kills me when Mexican restaurants take shortcuts on this. Anyhow, the rice was the best item on my plate. It was very tasty and fluffy with a little bit of veggies mixed in. The beans were just ok. The one good thing about this place were their warm and fresh chips and excellent salsa. The chip refills kept coming. My kids weren't in the mood for Mexican food so they ordered the chicken strip with fries kids meal. Their choice was very sad. Their chicken strips were 3 tiny slivers of fried chicken and the fries were soggy. I think the star on their menu are the fajitas that come out on a sizzling platter. Everyone seemed to be ordering it and it smelled divine.  However, my enchiladas and the kids meals were so disappointing that I probably won't return."}
{"text":"Cassie was awesome! Tried out a new neighborhood joint and it's a favorite. Food was tasty and service was great! Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Wow! Great authentic Mexican food! Homemade chips and salsa too! Such a good price for everything. I had the 2 item lunch combo...cheese enchilada and shredded chicken chimichanga with rice and beans. Everything came out hot and fresh and our server Chris was awesome! You definitely have to order one of their margaritas! Yum! We will definitely be back!!!!"}
{"text":"What a great Experience! The wait was not too long and we got our food promptly! Our server Ariel was so friendly and fast and always made sure we had everything we needed through out his shift! Food wasn't badly priced and believe me they give you plenty of food for the price. We will be back again thank you for a great experience!"}
{"text":"Complete garbage. Just came back from lunch and what a horrible experience. Server screwed up my order (gave me Beef as my order when I asked for Chicken). FYI, Beef is against my religion and yet I did not become aware of the taco filling until a few bites.  Then it took the server two times to ask what did I want in my new tacos.    Finally, a colleague had ask for a to go cup two times.    Also, the food was very poor.  Save yourself money and avoid this place."}
{"text":"Food is just ok. Margarita prices are way too overpriced. We specifically asked not to be seated next to the screaming kids. The hostess seated us a few feet away from the shrill screamers. Not a good experience. Ground beef chimi was very greasy. The .90 charge for a very small dollop of sour cream is a real ripoff."}
{"text":"BOY OH BOY was this place a disappointment. The service was great, but this food was the epitome of over priced Taco Bell. I ordered a tea, water, and Mexican pizza. There was NO flavor in the food at all. The beans, and cheese on top of thy pizza was exactly what you could order from Taco Bell. 10/10 would NOT recommend."}
{"text":"Loved it!!!! Got crispy rellano and enchilada... so good! Hubby loved his meal too. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This was my second visit with much improved service. On my first visit, right after they opened, the service was painfully slow. This time around was far better. I think they may still be working out a few issues but as long as it continues to improve I will be happy. The staff is super friendly and polite. Also the restaurant decor is nice and new and everything is super clean.  On this visit I was anxious to try their margaritas so I ordered my personal favorite the Cadillac margarita on the rocks. It did not disappoint. In fact it was without a doubt the best margarita I have had on the west side. I would go back for that alone-the picture I posted should speak for itself. My hubby's eyes lit up when they places his ice cold beer in front of him.  Five stars for the drinks! The food was good-is it the best Mexican food I've had? No, but it is definitely as good as the other \"sit down\" type restaurants in the area. That plus the drinks makes this my new go to place when we are looking for Mexican food and a night out. I hope their service continues to improve and the drinks don't change!"}
{"text":"Had fiesta for breakfast and the food was very good! Wish they had chilaquiles but the atmosphere and food is excellent."}
{"text":"Always our first choice. We really enjoy this place. We always request Eric's table. See you soon!"}
{"text":"Very good food and service.  Only reason I am docking one star, I get the mariachi band for atmosphere, but it is REALLY loud.  It is across the restaurant from us and we had to raise our voices to speak to each other.  Otherwise we love this place."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite Mexican food restaurants. The quality of food is delicious and the service is second to none! We use to live in the area however since our move, we now drive 30-40 minutes to eat here! The wait is fairly quick and the food is always fresh and hot! Be sure to save room for dessert because the deep fried ice cream is delicious!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! I find most mexican places overrated since im mexican and thats all i eat but fiestas is the only place i like to come to eat for mexican food! Great for families great food and service"}
{"text":"Awesome ceviche and starberry margaritas!!! Definitely recommend the ceviche! Will come again great service"}
{"text":"This my favorite Mexican restaurant . I love the Mexican decor and atmosphere. My favorite plate is camarones a la fiesta .  Really enjoy taking my family there ."}
{"text":"Food is delicious and margaritas are SUPER strong! Def recommend this place! Management and staff are great!"}
{"text":"This is one of those reviews can be mistaken for someone who is very upset and saying things that are exaggerated. I don't exaggerate ever. We decided that after waiting an entire hour for our food that we should leave. Several weeks earlier, our experience there was pleasant and the food was very good. The truly most offensive part of this afternoon was that we waited an hour before we walked out but immediately before we walked out we witnessed a large group that was seated at least 45 minutes after us get their food. This is absolutely unacceptable and even though the food is good the best they're going to get for me is two stars and I consider that to be a generous review."}
{"text":"This restaurant was a very nice surprise!  We were on the west side of town and found it on Yelp. We called to make a reservation for 13 and they were able to accommodate our large group. It was pretty packed when we got there as well as during our dinner. I liked the festive ambience of the place as well as the brightly painted art on the chairs and tables which let you know that your taste buds were about to have a Fiesta Mexicana (pun intended)!  The chips and salsa were delicious, I think we must have gotten our baskets replenished at least twice per basket and we had 4 baskets at our table. The salsa has a slight kick to it but is quite addicting.  After flipping through the 8 page menu and looking at all the tempting, mouth watering pictures, I finally decided on the Camarones a La Plancha (grilled butterfly shrimp marinated in garlic sauce served with mushrooms, sour cream, guacamole, rice, and refried beans.   The plate was humongous (see pic) and the meal was absolutely phenomenal! Somehow I instantly forgot the fact that I had a huge hand in polishing off not 1, not 2, but almost 3 baskets of chips and salsa as they prepared our Mexican feast. The shrimp came with a butter dip that reminded me of the garlic butter shrimp that you get from the shrimp trucks in Hawaii. I don't ever recall having mushrooms as a side dish with my Mexican food before, but they were sautéed in butter too and I'd have to say were the best tasting shrooms I've ever experienced. The rice, beans, and guacamole were top notch too. Some might say $15 for the plate is a bit pricey but it was worth every penny!  My 2 sets of brother and sister-in-laws both opted for the Molcajete as their eyes were bigger than their stomachs. I don't know what Molcajete means in Spanish but if I had to guess I would say \"as much delicious food as you can stuff into a large bowl\".  It came out looking like a steaming floral arrangement of grilled skirt steak, grilled chicken, shrimp, pork chops, chorizo, mozzarella, grilled cactus, special red tomato sauce served in a half volcano bowl with rice, beans, guac, and sour cream on the side.   There was so much tender goodness packed in there that they let me partake in a few choice morsels of chicken, steak, cactus, etc., all of which were delicious. My brother-in-law kept commenting on how tender and tasty everything was, and I'd have to agree.   I somehow managed to clean my entire plate off and went straight to food coma mode, but they both took a ton of leftovers from the 2 Molcajete bowls. In hindsight 3 adults could probably share one of those bad boys and you still might have some leftovers.   I had no idea that they have one of these in Chandler but now that I know, I will definitely be hitting that one up as it is closer to where I live.   Give this place a try, you will not be disappointed! In fact I can't believe the Yelp rating on this place is only 4 stars."}
{"text":"Everything about this place was great!  The plates are huge so sharing should definitely be an option.  I had a combo platter so I could try a little of everything. Tamales are very meaty. Chicken burritos came with red sauce which usually isn't my preference but the chicken burrito was fabulous!  Above all our waitress was so kind and very prompt with refills etc.  I would make a special trip for this place."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service at a great price!! The only downside is that each time we go, the ladies restroom is a mess.. th first stall has had a broken door lock for every and tonight there was used paper towels all over the floor and counter with toilet seat covers stuck on the stools...."}
{"text":"I know there are a lot of more authentic places in Phoenix, but for very good mainstream Mexican, this place is amazing! Their salsa is like no other I've ever tasted and my meal was great, (see picture). I will definitely be back and encourage others to try this place. There free dessert promotion is a little misleading, but good none the less. I'd give 5 stars if it weren't for the deceptive dessert promotion."}
{"text":"I flew out from DC to visit my grandpa in Chandler this week, and I asked him to take me to a good, authentic Mexican restaurant. (Something lacking from the DC area) He brought me here, and I'm glad he did. I ordered the Fiesta Mediana Combo where you pick two entrees, and it comes with rice and beans on the side. I picked Chimichanga and Enchiladas with shredded beef. The restaurant offers free chips and salsa which both taste very homemade. The salsa has a nice kick to it for anyone who loves spicy food. Great experience, but 4 stars only because I've had better Mexican food in San Diego. But, if you're looking for a great bang for your buck as far as quantity is concerned without sacrificing the taste, I recommend this place to you!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very nice and decorated, but I had taken my mother out for a birthday dinner and arrived at 8:30 after seeing a movie. With plenty of tables open we asked if there was open seating in the bar, and we were told that's fine. After we sat we were told those seats were reserved and taken back to the host desk. Being the only ones waiting in the lobby for 30 minutes with plenty of seats open everywhere, we were told they were finding a server who can take us. Once we got seated it took another 15 minutes before we were, not greeted but just asked if we were ready to order... so the atmosphere is good, but don't expect amazing service. No reason to mention anything about the food."}
{"text":"On Cinco de Mayo we decided to venture out and try this spot. Wow. Great atmosphere, a wait of maybe 45 minutes with no reservation on the big day. All hands full tilt we even had the manager serving us!  Food 5 star. Drinks 5 star. Very reasonable price too."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants. Best chips and salsa in town. I love the Chicken Fajitas... Service is great I highly recommend Fiesta Mexicana."}
{"text":"It was decent. Long wait to get in. I got the combo plate with chimichanga. It was soft and mooshy. Not crispy at all. The beef had zero flavor. Best thing was the chips and salsa. Probably won't be back. Disappointing considering there was a wait and it seemed like a busy place."}
{"text":"Coworker recommended this place. All I can say is thank you! This place is amazing. In the west valley there isn't many restaurants to go but I'm going to add this to a must go place. The food is delicious, the restaurant is beautiful and colorful, and customer service is great. What more can you ask for? You should try it out. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"love this place, in our case a small drive, but well worth it. been there twice now and have not regretted it at all."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food EVER!!  And I have lived in so cali, nv, and az.  The food is fresh, there is a dish for every dietary need, the staff is friendly and personal.  Shout out to Eric and Elizabeth, we keep coming cause they rule!  We always ask to sit in their section. The drinks at the bar are wonderful and rival the cocktail artisans in Las Vegas. You can always tell the quality of a Mexican restaurant by their beans/rice and Flan.  Here....wow... .so good!!  The Flan brings me back to childhood.  Mi tia, Luicita, would make Flan on special occasions.  My abuelita would guard it like a hawk,  \"only 1, you get only 1 piece!!\" As a Cuban, to hell with puerco lachon! Hook me up with the seafood tostada and the Cuba Libres!!"}
{"text":"Craving for Mexican food tonight, we've decided to come here and try it out. The restaurant is definitely well decorated. I can tell the restaurant owners put a lot of thoughts into it. Absolutely beautiful and amazing. For appetizer, we ordered the shrimp cocktail. The juice is a bit too runny, but the shrimp portion is generous. For main entrée, we ordered Fajitas and shredded chicken tacos. The meat was juicy and other items (beans, shredded veggies, guacamole) goes so well with the dish. Service was great. Our server checked up on us during the whole meal.  We ordered the fried ice-cream for dessert and it was just ok. It has some sticky crust covering the ice-cream and I personality did not care for it.   Service was great, food portion was generous, prices are reasonable...I'll definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"All I can say is... wow!!! I've been to some pretty good Mexican food restaurants, but this place is amazing!  My wife and I came up here on a Sunday afternoon to try somewhere new and we were not disappointed.  I had the sampler combo to try out a little bit of everything and the plate came out over loaded with deliciousness. My wife had the Chili Verde and says it tastes like Mama used to make. The salsa was amazingly fresh tasting and the sophapillas (forgive my spelling), was so delicious.  The service here was quick and right on top of it and so friendly. I would definitely recommend this place and will certainly be back!!! Come on down for some truly good Mexican food served by a wonderful staff."}
{"text":"I absolutely recommend this place. Me and my husband come from California we're there is so many Mexican restaurants and this one was like if we were back home having real Mexican food. We had drinks from the bar, man where they good. You can literally taste the tequila in the drink. I will be coming back again"}
