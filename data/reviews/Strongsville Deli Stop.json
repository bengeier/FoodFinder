{"text":"I went here for lunch and ordered an italian sub. It was delicious. I didn't know what to expect from a convenient store but I was pleased. Will go back again."}
{"text":"If you work in the Business & Technology Park in Strongsville, this place is the closest sandwich shop... which really is all it has going for it... the pure convenience.  It's just a gas station... minus gas.  They have a \"deli\"  but they only make like 6 sandwiches.  They aren't bad sandwiches (they're pretty good actually)... but there are only 6 of them...  They have a surprisingly good craft beer selection though."}
{"text":"Not good... Stopped on St. Party's for a corned beef... Very fatty tough to eat... Dissapointed"}
{"text":"Good corner deli. Like the subs and a very good selection of craft beer. Nice that they offer single beers to try instead of having to buy an entire six pack."}
{"text":"I've been living a block away from this place since I've moved here and I go there almost everyday. They have almost everything you need on the go. Sandwiches, soup ice cream and chips. Beer for my dad and we stop there to get snacks every night. It's just great. The people who run the place are a great family. Friendly to everyone"}
{"text":"Mediocre   I got a turkey sub. I wish I could have chosen my bread, but I wasn't asked. It was fine, but nothing to write home about.   I also had the grandma's potato salad. It was outstanding. I wish I would have had a vat of it LOL"}
{"text":"I would give this place 0 stars if I could. The owners are complete assholes. They are always really rude, don't care if you're waiting at the register. One time the owner was sick and my mom suggested he go home and get rest so he doesn't get customers sick, and he said \"What? Do you live in a f*ckin' bubble??\"   The owners years and years and years ago were SO nice. We miss them!"}
