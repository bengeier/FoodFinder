{"text":"Checked out this place over the weekend since I bought the living social deal & it was about to expire! It was definitely worth the $25 we spent on the voucher. We had a flight of 3 cabernet wines & a flight of 3 chardonnay wines. We received a plate EACH of 2 cheeses with grapes, apples & nuts. Surprisingly we had a bit more cheese than we did of the fruit & nuts. Could have used a piece of bread on each plate to finish it off.  The bistro wasn't busy at all but the vibe felt a bit stuffy even though they did have baseball on the TV. The staff was just a couple of bartenders who seemed friendly & our server. The server was a tad odd & he mumbled when he spoke. All in all the food was just decent. We did only have the sweet potato fries & 2 teeny street tacos (2) for $5 on HH.  The prices were reasonable since we stuck to the Happy Hour menu. I think I have a couple of other wine places in the East Valley that would be my choice before I go back to D'Vine. I'd say 2.5 stars if there was a half to give."}
{"text":"Friday night at D'Vine's was just that: divine.  There were four different wines and 3 entrees bought to our table that evening and everybody was very impressed with every one of the wonderful flavors.  Neil Staub was entertaining, and was a perfect compliment to the atmosphere at D'Vine's.  You could still have conversation when you chose to, but Staub's music brought about a very enjoyable balance of fun and romance that kept us engaged most of the time.  It was my first time there but it just became a new favorite."}
{"text":"Dvine has got to be the best place in all of Arizona for a stuffed portobello mushroom.  Should I even mention the service?  One word, fantastic.  The staff is always willing to steer you in the right direction.  Our server is always Tim or Lauren (by request).  Insider info, try the scallops."}
{"text":"Great date night restaurant. I love going here. The patio in the evening (not in the summer) is great. Strangely the macaroni is the best there.  I also love the street tacos."}
{"text":"Tried D'Vine for lunch just days after it first opened; loved it then, love it now. It's simply, consistently a great place to eat with a vibe that's refreshingly unexpected in Mesa.  The last time I ate here, it was early evening and my friend and I decided to share salad and tapas instead of a full meal. We started with the black & bleu salad, a savory combination of Cajun-spiced beef tenderloin, bleu cheese crumbles, romaine lettuce, sliced tomato, and bacon served with their house vinaigrette.   We then sampled the to-die-for stuffed mushroom (marinated and grilled portobello stuffed with cheese, roasted garlic, red onions and bacon), the slightly pedestrian but still good sweet potato fries, and the signature salmon cakes, delicious with the lemon aioli.   If you're looking for a full dinner, I highly recommend the grilled salmon, the grilled pork tenderloin and the ahi. Craving comfort food? Pick the mac & cheese -- a little decadent but totally worth the calories!  As other reviewers have suggested, sit outside if it's not too hot."}
{"text":"The filet is amazing, always consistent.  The duck burger is really tastes too.  Their service is top notch and the usually have entertainment.  Some of the players are really talented.  The level of the music isn't too loud.  Also there are local artists drawings and paintings for sale that are beautiful!"}
{"text":"Not sure where yelpers are coming from. This is easily a 5 star joint. Great people. Great menu at a good price. This is a neighborhood hangout and the neighborhood goes there! Best Edamame in town. Great filet!!!"}
{"text":"Met long lost relatives here last night for dinner. First time there. Loved the setting ( both inside and out - with misters). Good service and food. I got Ahi tuna which was good although I was not fond of the spices. The tuna was high quality. My cousin and his wife got a salad and pasta. They said it was delicious. I will return and try another entree. Oh, they also had live music inside. Very good musician singing and playing the guitar."}
{"text":"We go there once every week.. Amazing food and service for a neighborhood restaurant.. We recommend everyone .. Love music, great ambiance ... Since we go after great food this place is one of few"}
{"text":"Just there for dinner. Only waited 15 minutes or so for a table on a Saturday night.  Sat outside under the heaters.  Our waitress Lola was very attentive - great service.  Had the bruschetta appetizers - Delicious.  Main course had the special which was scallops. My husband had the ahi tuna and our friend had the spaghetti and meatballs. Scallops were cooked perfectly as was the ahi tuna. Lots of food but not too much. We all really enjoyed the food.  Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I don't drink alcohol, so I cannot comment on the \"wine\" part, but the food (salmon steak) was absolutely amazing. The service was prompt, and the atmosphere very relaxing. To top it all, the live music (one dude, playing Bill Withers on a guitar) really clicked for me."}
{"text":"Used to be a lot of fun, but prices went up and service went down. Finding new place to hang out with friends!"}
{"text":"Weakest service I have ever had in AZ. Unless you think missing an entire persons meal is acceptable.  And without apology none the less.  Small over priced portions as well.  WAY better food within 100 yards of this place.  Will not be back."}
{"text":"This was our 3rd visit here and we find the entire venue handy, comfortable and we normally try their daily specials and were not disappointed this time around. Had the lamb tenderloin which came cut up into pieces but it was tasty and had a very mild lamb taste, the vegetables and gravy were incredibly salty but this was a minor concern given the overall meal.  My wife had a filet mignon and it was as good as expected.  All washed down with a 2007 Franciscan \"Magnificat\" meritage, mmmmmm... superb, after it had  time to breath. It is a nice venue for relaxing and being with friends."}
{"text":"Went after work with a small group for happy hour.  Nice atmosphere.  Was disappointed in the selection of appetizers on the happy hour menu, but was able to find a bruschetta on the main menu.  Pricey for what I got at $13, I thought.  When the bill came several of us were surprised at the price, including one poor guy who paid $28 for 2 cocktails.  When we asked if the bill was right, the waiter said yes, but before he even got away from the table he muttered, \"Jesus Christ\" loud enough for some of us to hear.    I give more than one star because of the general overall upbeat vibe.  Maybe the server was having an awful day.  But mediocre selection and high prices will keep us away.  I think someone was going to write a letter to the management...."}
{"text":"A great hidden gem in east mesa. The happy hour deals are great and the servers always recommend a great glass of wine. Great place for date night as well!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place for dinner with another couple. Probably the only complaint I have about this place is that it is hard to find. We had a very helpful and courteous waiter. Live music was good. It was a beautiful Arizona night to sit on the pation.   Our friends, who joined us, dine out regularly and have high expectations for what they would consider a nice meal. They commented several times how everything they ordered was really good and would definitely go back. My husband and I shared an appetizer and the chicken parmesan, one of their staples. The only dissapointment there was that we decided to share the plate. The garlic, vegetables and pesto sauce created some delicious flavoring. Although, the plate did have a lot of extra olive. Every dish that I saw served made me want to go back and try it. The chocolate cake was devoured in minutes by my friend.  He nodded 'yes' in between bites when I asked if it was good. Tiramisu was good but not the best I have had."}
{"text":"We were a party of 8 taking our grandparents out for a special celebration. Even though we didn't make a reservation we were seated promptly. They have a great wine selection. Their food menu has a wide selection as well. We each ordered something different off the menu and everything was just scrumptious!! I had the seared Ahi tuna and my husband had the pork tenderloin. Both were phenomenal. Service was impeccable and friendly. It was a bit dark but over all it was a great lil find!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent; however do not come here if you are under 65 years old. The crowd is aged and the live music fits their youth. They seem to love it. As someone in their 30s, the scene is too mature."}
{"text":"We tried this wine bar the other night - so good! The food was tasty and the wait staff was very kind. The performer on the night we were there had a phenomenal voice. All in all, a great escape for the evening."}
{"text":"Great place nice people.  Had the scallop salad with some of their seasonal wines.  Very nice evening."}
{"text":"Went for my mom's birthday.  We wanted to like it, we really did, but the service was super slow, verging on nonexistent.  The most expensive ingredients in all of our dishes were nowhere to be found either. They seemed like the kind of place to add one extremely small piece of an expensive ingredient just to be able to justify a price hike when it wasn't noticeable in the dish at all.  Will not be back."}
{"text":"The ambience was very nice with a pretty cool band was playing, the salmon panini we was pretty good but why it only received two stars?  We ordered which perhaps is the worst pizza I've ever had! I'm not a picky eater by any means but they should seriously take it off the menu, I've had better frozen pizzas!"}
{"text":"I've been here 4 times and it is consistently good. The staff is very accomodating and the happy hour is excellent. The bruschetta is superb!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to D'vine since 2007 and it was originally my favorite go to restaurant in the south Chandler area.  Fell in love with the excellent Portobello Mushroom appetizer.  Their scallops and any seafood dish was always cooked to perfection and their steaks were all surprisingly very good.  This was a much better value than the over priced Cork on Alma School just north of Chandler Heights.  I hate to say that each year I've been coming to D'vine the food quality and attentive service kept getting worse and the consistency became hit or miss.  Because I loved it so much and had such good memories from years ago I kept finding myself giving it another chance, and each time I left I looked at my wife and said that was the last time.  Service from the servers have become un-caring, food has literally become average at best with little attention to detail.  Such a shame for what was once such a great small local bistro/wine bar with great \"tapas\" style dishes and fantastic full dinner items.  Too bad...   D'vine unfortunately for you, you have gotten my last $.  I will never go their again and will tell everyone of my associates and friends to avoid.   If I seem a little mad, well I am.  To have my favorite hidden treasure taken away from me due to listless management/ownership and disinterested servers is very upsetting.  Once my favorite, now 1 star at best."}
{"text":"Great food, with a menu that seems to be a bit different each time we go in.  It is definitely not a quiet place, as all the finishes are hard; looks nice, but don't expect a quiet evening if the table in the corner is whooping it up.  Other than that, really enjoy this place, whether it be for a drink, or a full meal."}
{"text":"Well, visit numero dos sees an upgrade to 3 stars with much better service and nice evening overall.   However, they were out of the osso buco (the one thing I really wanted to try) so any chance at 4 will have to wait....."}
{"text":"My Fiancée and I went in for lunch, Joey the bartender immediately introduced herself. She was very upbeat and friendly. It was my first time there and she was very knowledgeable about the food and wine. She suggested the Salmon Entrée for myself and the Scallop salad for my girl. She paired this with a bottle of the Duckhorn Sauvignon Blanc.The food and service was amazing and  I would definitely say this was an experience to remember in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"This entry is about D'Vine Bistro and Wine Bar in Chandler. I wish I was more competent with my word processor, because I'd like to divide the review into three columns: Very Successful, Adequate, and Giant Flop. I think it would mean more if you could see side-by-side comparisons, but you'll just have to try and visualize it.  I'll be nice and start with the Very Successful column.  (1)The menu: it's full of innovative selections. There are a number of Tapas, such as fried plantain cakes topped with grilled mango poke, seared pork belly, and a habanero vinaigrette ($8) and salmon cakes with chipotle molasses ($7). Many of the entrees come with interesting sides and sauces, for instance grilled pork tenderloin with a pan seared goat cheese polenta cake and roasted peppers, finished with a chipotle, espresso and raspberry BBQ sauce ($18). Which leads me to the Most Very Successful item of the evening. (2) Ken ordered one of the specials, a New Zealand farm-raised venison 2 rib chop with a juniper berry marinade, accompanied by spinach and roasted potato hash and the raspberry espresso BBQ sauce. Given how far the deer had to travel, the $32 price tag didn't seem too unreasonable. The chop was truly superb, moist and flavorful but not gamey. The sauce suited it perfectly. (3): portion sizes were quite generous. And (4): White anchovies were featured in several of the dishes.  That's it for the Very Successful.   On to Adequate. (1) The ambience is pleasant, if somewhat noisy. There's a bar, with a television above it, high top tables, and those of regular height. The paintings on the wall are for-sale originals, some good, some not-so. There is a patio (this will also appear in the Giant Flop column). (2); Our dessert selection of chocolate mousse cake was \"corporate food\", not made in-house, and nothing special, but certainly both edible and size-able. The coffee fell in this column, too. (3) The nicoise salad ($12) ordered by our friend Sena came with seared Ahi tuna rather than the canned variety packed in olive oil. This would have put it in the Very Successful category for me, but Sena likes the more traditional canned tuna.   OK. Here's the column you've probably been waiting for: Giant Flops. I'll start with (1) the above mentioned patio. The misters were on and it felt like London on a foggy morning. When we asked that they be turned off, nobody warned us that we would get dripped on, and our drinks would get dripped in. We soggily moved inside. (2) Sangria shouldn't be offered unless the proper ingredients are available. The white sangria ($5 at happy hour) given to us had a few slices of lemon in a poor quality wine. When we told our waitress that it was unacceptable she brought us a little carafe of \"berry juice\" to add to it. This made it even worse. (3) Nobody should ever put slices of cucumber in drinking water. While it may look stylish, after about 5 minutes it tastes really strange, and after 15 it's horrible. Imagine drinking it while eating chocolate mousse cake!! (4) My entree. I ordered one of the specials - fried chicken marinated in buttermilk, served with gouda mac & cheese, sauteed vegetables and a rainbow peppercorn gravy ($18). I asked for all dark meat, and my plate arrived with two huge chicken legs. I thought the coating was good, although the crispness of the coating was quickly lost to the gravy. The first few bites were quite good, the chicken was moist, with a pleasant taste. But then I noticed how pink the chicken meat was getting as I got closer to the bone, and it was actually almost raw in the center. The second leg, which I had given to Ken was somewhat smaller, and he said it was adequately cooked. The mac & cheese, if it had a flavor, was drowned out by the gravy which was cough-inducingly peppery. The sauteed vegetables consisted of a few strands of bell peppers.   When our bill arrived, $6 had been deducted from the price of my entree, and we had not been charged for the sangria (which we had not drunk).  As we were leaving the restaurant a woman whom I assume is the manager asked how our meal was. I politely listed some of our complaints and she seemed genuinely upset and was quite apologetic. While we were getting into the car she came out to the parking lot and gave us a gift certificate to use if we'd give D'Vine a second chance. Because of the items in the Very Successful column, I think we will. It's not every place that has pork belly, white anchovies and venison."}
{"text":"Decent food, good wine, nice music, but a little pricey for what you get.  I could come back if there was a good wine special but otherwise it's just an ok place in my book... But after the desert a cheesecake that is just bad@ss this went from 3 to 4 stars!"}
{"text":"They take reservations in the summer, not in the winter which is unfortunate.  Went last night and Filet was overcooked and the server never came back and never asked how our food was.  Disappointed.  Great place for wine flights, but the food and service is not as good as it used to be."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, you will feel like you left the valley.  Intimate environment with live music.  The food was good quality.  Creative dishes, nice presentation.  Great selection of wines.  Save room for dessert."}
{"text":"I have an opinion about d'Vine. The problem is that it's all over the place. I think the restaurant is very pretty, traditional wine bar decorations. Candle light, wood furniture, shades of ruby, green, gold and bronze.  The food is typical wine bar. Cheese plates, a few protein choices and nightly specials.  The wine is expensive. For a late afternoon wine get together with friends, you can each expect to spend between $40-$60 dollars if you want a snack and two glasses of wine. Or that's been my going rate the last two times I've been. And that's just ordering middle of the road wine. Not too cheap...not too expensive."}
{"text":"A great evening. This bistro is a terrific find. The staff was knowledgeable about the wine and the food was fabulous. Our server was Kevin ( this was his first night serving and he was great). Two slight negatives; the house salad dressing is blah and only one bottle of the Runquist cab was available. However on the second point the bartender Mandy suggested a fine alternate. The ambiance is great- a tad crowded, but  open and surprisingly quiet. The artwork on the walls is all for sale ( some very nice pieces- we bought one).  Prices are reasonable for this kind of experience - go, you will be glad you did."}
{"text":"I'm giving it 5 stars. Patrons were friendly and suggested many great menus items. I tried several appetizers and they have a nice wine list. I sat at the bar for my visit and the bartender from Santa Paula was fast, friendly and welcoming. It upscale, priced well and not too busy to wait the ambience. If your looking for a sports bar crowd - it's not that."}
{"text":"atmosphere is ok to pretty good and the wine selection is good.  apps are well done and a few good choices on bigger bites.  with not much else in the area it rocks...but the patio could use a little TLC.  will be back for more!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for several months now. Both the food and customer service has been consistently good. Tonight turned out to be a disappointing exception.  I sat at the bar to for some wine and food. I didn't recognize the bartender, so I assumed he was relatively new. He was prompt in getting my drink order. When he gave me my wine he asked if I wanted food, I replied yes. He gave me a menu that turned out to be the cocktail menu; there was no food dishes on it. I decided to wait to get his attention. In the meantime a gentleman came in and sat at the bar. The bartender gave him his drink, and gave him a food menu. A couple minutes later he went back to the gentleman and got his food order, the bartender never came back to me. What's more, two ladies sitting next to me got plenty of service from him, he brought them food, etc.   After what I estimate was around 15 to 20 minutes, the bartender returned to me and asked if I'd like to order some food or needed a few more minutes. I had zero interest in his wait service at this point and replied no and requested the check for the single glass of wine I had.  I'm off the viewpoint that because there are so many restaurants to choose from, a single bad experience is, in my estimate, enough to write off a place. However, I've had such good experiences here in the past I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt and give them another chance, but it won't be of my choosing. I won't go out of my way to return here, a friend would have to suggest dining here for me to return."}
{"text":"Do not go there for the food.  It is an overpriced disappointment.  Ambience is okay.  If you sit in the bar area, the music is too loud for conversation."}
{"text":"Over rated, over priced, service is sub par, dirty bathroom, food doesn't make up for all the negatives. Been there 3 times, won't go again."}
{"text":"this review will be short  my wife and another couple had lunch on wed. around 1pm and all had different items--my wife had a pasta dish that was on their special's----thursday at 2:30 pm my wife became violently ill--after haveing a horrible eve i took her to the emergancy room at chandler hostpital where she was admitted and spent the next 4.5 days with i-v;s pouring in antibiotics it was determined by the attending doctor that she had colonitis and it had come from the pasta that she ate at around lunch time the day before---wed.12pm/2pm/ i would not have written this but the manager went on the defencive letting me know that she had been in the buisness for over 16 years and had handled a lot of these calls i asked for the owners name and their insurance company and she said she would call me back with the info---guess what--no call  go ahead and eat there---we won't"}
{"text":"Tired and hungry my husband and I visited this restaurant while staying at the Holiday Inn nearby.  It was a wonderful break from three days of socializing.  Nice ambiance on patio, perfect weather (January) was busy, but well staffed and attentive.  I have trouble swallowing and need water often, they never failed to keep it full.  Enjoyed the filet and risotto and a few drinks too."}
{"text":"Went here with friends at their insistence.  Menu offered a good variety, but dishes were overpriced for the portion size and quality.  Service was only fair, in my opinion.  The location is way too far away from home for me to make that trip again."}
{"text":"First visit today.  We liked it a lot.  Very casual, comfortable atmosphere.  Our server, Chandra, was very helpful in answering our various questions about their fairly broad menu.    We chose the wine flights, one each of red and white, and enjoyed most of the pre-selected choices.  The cheese board was good, as were the brussel sprouts and the mac n cheese (we got the green chili version).  We will be back, soon."}
{"text":"We still love this place. Thought I'd just update three years after my original review to let you know how the staff dealt with a recent problem.   In short, they were awesome. Kristi was fantastic.  Basically, we like to order take-out from here every now and then. Ordering takeout is awesome here -- no matter who is on that night to answer the phone, they are always fast, professional, and they repeat your order back, no mistakes. The food is ready for pickup on time. It's a beautiful thing.  Tonight was a rare off night. I'm actually secretly kind of glad that the folks at D'vine are human. Our order was slightly messed up (got a different entree than what we ordered) and we probably wouldn't have even bothered to call them on that--the entree we got instead looked delicious. But the salmon on the Caesar salad was pretty much raw, and not safe to eat.  So my husband called D'vine and explained the situation. Kristi was immediately gracious, apologetic, and gave him the option of refund or reorder. We chose to reorder, and she gave us 2 complimentary pieces of cheesecake along with some really sweet and funny notes on our takeout boxes. What a terrific way to deal with a mistake. Instead of feeling grumpy, we are delighted.  Another five star review, D'vine -- you guys sure know how to handle a mistake with grace."}
{"text":"Let me preface this with the fact that I've been going to this wine bar since I first moved to the Valley (4 years) and I don't ever come onto Yelp with intentions to leave negative reviews and generally choose to come here to highlight the positive experiences that I've had in the hopes that those establishments will receive more customers.   I've only been to the DVine in Chandler and I keep hoping that it will improve...I really have felt that it had a lot of potential and I kept giving it chances, but given my most recent experience there and with the opening of Postino down the street from me, I'm going to have to say that I probably won't go there again unless it is to meet with some specific friends who live nearby and still like it. And I probably won't order a meal.  So here are the good things (not experienced on my most recent visit last week, but previously experienced):  - Generally a decent selection of wine by the glass - Decent cheese plate with good selections - A nice patio and a nice place to observe a beautiful sunset - Rude waiter (think his name was Joe?) is gone (thanks be!) or at least I think so - Nice atmosphere and decor - Location  So the not so great things that have finally prompted me to write this review:  - Staff and service is inconsistent and unpleasant - Unremarkable and overpriced food  Here's the scoop:  Salads:  don't order.  I've always been disappointed. Haven't ordered one in a while, but the vegetarian at our table order the mixed greens with salmon cake last week and barely ate from it.  Too much lettuce vs. toppings. I've always enjoyed the cheese plate as they rotated their specialty cheeses and it comes with plenty of fruit, etc. The bruschetta are pretty good too, and you can typically get these at HH prices. However, I have not been impressed with the rest of the menu.  I've had several entrees and they were boring and overpriced.  Last week I decided to give the grilled cheese a go and it was awful.  I literally choked it down and only ate it because I was starving and our server didn't come back to check on us.  It was literally two pieces of panini with maybe one slice of cheese melted in between....there was nothing else on it. It was dry and bland and over toasted.  The fries that came with it were overly salted.  The presentation was nonexistent Literally. Just a bunch of fries and a bland piece of toast on a white plate.  Now you ask, 'why did she order a grilled cheese at a wine bar?\"  Well, I've had some of the best grilled cheeses EVER at a wine bar or high end restaurant!  Yes! It can be done!   The service was dismal.  :(  I hate to say it because I genuinely don't come to review on yelp to leave negative reviews, but I do rely on others' honest reviews to make some of my choices when choosing a place to go to.  :(    The hostess sat two of us and we let her know that we were waiting for a couple of others, but wanted to order wine and an appetizer.  A server took about 10 min to show up and when she did, she had to turn around and come back and take my order again because she forgot what I ordered.  She returned with my wine and when the 2nd person tried to put in a order she took forever to bring it out ...finally another server came to take our order and we had to tell him we had given it the first server.  At that point a switch in servers took place w/o a word to us.  I guess? We had to ask for plates and silverware several times. It took forever to get any of the items we asked for.    The food was generally blah and the service was worse.  The finale for a terrible time:  when our bill came, I noticed that the bruschetta and my wine didn't have happy hour pricing (I was there well before happy hour ended and I know it's only a couple of bucks, but still...we would have gone to Cork if not for the HH here).  So I asked the server to double check and make the adjustment and he basically said that the computer would charge the HH price, but he'd look at it.  Ok.  So guess what? I'm guessing the first server didn't put it in the computer at the right time.  I really don't know  But HH prices weren't reflected on the bill, so I asked if he could adjust it  and he said ok.  We gave him our cards.  He never made the adjustment.  He just ran our cards through. :(  I am irritated and frustrated and it is the final straw for me. I still left a good 20% tip because I'm not going to be a jerk, but it was not deserved and I wish I could've said that to them....but they never came back to refill water or check back with us so how could we give feedback?  DVine - you've lost a loyal customer.  Hope you read this and service gets better!"}
{"text":"Need a quick place to relax during a super stressful work day and D'Vine delivered.  We weren't super hungry... just needed to get out of the office and relax.  So my friend and I shared the coconut calamari and brushetta (caprese, proscuitto, and artichoke).  The food was satisfying and the toppings on the bruschetta were plentiful.  It was the perfect quick bite to re-energize a person.  Although good, the prices are steep and the two dishes were $20+."}
{"text":"Super friendly waiter & Thursday night is ladies night, so $2 off glass of wine, etc. We got a few different types of bruschetta that we really good! The Brie/Apple was my favorite. I'd definitely go again."}
{"text":"Excellent food and very reasonably priced.  I will be coming back here many times to try the rest of the menu"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant around. I love everything they make, their happy hour had great food, and the wine is always great! Wish they had done hard liquor, but it IS a wine bar. Excellent service with very attentive staff. 5 stars all the way!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been going here since it first opened and we try to go here at least twice a month. Lately,  we've noticed some changes that we don't really like.  For starters, Dvine now has a liquor license.   While it may be good for business, it changes the ambience a bit because the focus is no longer wine.    We also noticed that the wine list appears to be smaller. I use the word appears because I have yet to confirm this with any of the long term staff.  If it is smaller, it just goes to show the change in focus.  A wine bar needs to focus on wine. Reducing the wine list takes the place out of the wine bar category and places it into the restaurant category.   All that being said, the food and service are excellent and we will continue to come here.  Maybe just not as often."}
{"text":"We went in yesterday for the regrand opening and it was great. I loved that they had gluten free options as I have celiac. The street tacos were very good with a little kick which I love!  What I like about the place was the atmosphere, great music, attentive staff and overall a fun place to be."}
{"text":"A great neighborhood restaurant. Food and wine at their best. Friendly servers and great outdoor seating."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place!  We have been going there since they opened.  Atmosphere is great, they have live music.  The food and wine out of this world!  I love the brushetta and my husband loves their fish tacos.  It is a great place for date night."}
{"text":"The food was just ok small plates took over one hour to get served The service was non existent no organization at all lousy management very disappointed will not return"}
{"text":"I've never been disappointed at D'Vine--the waitstaff is friendly, the wine delectable and the food excellent!  My favorite go-to dish is the Scallop Salad--it's fabulous with the gruyere cheese and apples--nom, nom! I'm also a fan of the Bruschetta and the Calamari!   Go on a night when a live band is performing, the atmosphere is comfy and fun and great for a casual night out!"}
{"text":"Finally got around to going to D'vine Bistro and Wine Bar. Pleasantly surprised! We are very picky, and I can find fault with about everyplace we go to. That being said...the broccolini was a bit salty. But other than that everything was very good. The Bruschetta appetizer was excellent, (we had the salmon, brie/apple, caprese) Happy hour prices are a couple dollars off, appetizers and wine. The ribeye was so delicious, and my partner had the grouper special. Everything was cooked well, and service was good. We will go back."}
{"text":"Just what you  would  expect from this establishment the service was without flaw and the food was exceptional and all this was happy hour supersedes all expectations"}
{"text":"Don't order food for pick-up, the attached picture will tell the story - so much for my birthday dinner.... :(  Burned bread, very little filling, SUPER disappointed!"}
{"text":"My wife and I called for a reservation for two in the afternoon for a 7:30 seating on 3/16/16.  All was good when we got there, we were seated outside, introduced to Clay who would be our waiter, and provided menus.  5 minutes later a waitress came to the table and told us she would be handling our table for the evening instead of Clay.  No worries, except after getting a drink we didn't see her again for 15 minutes.  I could see her inside talking to a table where she remained for 5 minutes.  When she finally got to our table I jokingly said I was worried about her that she had gotten lost.  No apology, she snapped \"I'm really busy.\"  We placed our orders and sat for another 5 minutes with no contact with her.  Water glasses empty, cocktail glasses empty, no waitress.  I got her attention and she reluctantly came to the table with horrible body language.  I asked her to cancel our order and bring me the check for the drinks.  No apology, no question about what she could do, instead another snide comment, \"I wish you'd have told me this before I placed your order!\"  I had taken my whole family to D'Vine for New Year's Eve and we had a great meal and service, but this experience won't have me return any time soon.  Oh yeah, we went across the street to Red White & Brew and had outstanding service and a great meal."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this restaurant!!  The menu is creative and the food prepared perfectly!!  The Chocolate mousse cake beyond decadent.  Kristiana was a very pleasant addition to an already amazing dinner.  Thank you!!"}
{"text":"We went on a double date to Divine and had an AWESOME time! We caught a little of happy hour, which is always nice to find on a Saturday, then had entrees. My friend and I had the seared ahi tuna which was yummy. My husband had the Cajun fettucini Alfredo with chicken which honestly was the best Alfredo we have ever had. Not to mention my mixed drink was nice and strong :) our waiter Vincent was excellent! He pulled our chairs out for us, replaced our silverware with every course and was very knowledgeable about the menu and wines. Lastly there was live music, which I don't normally like because its always to loud to converse, but the music was at a perfect sound level and was fun music choices. Overall we had so much fun and will definitely be coming back often!"}
{"text":"LOVED the bruchetta with artichoke mmmm and the live music really makes for a nice change when enjoying a delicious meal and having an amazing glass of wine! Thursday nite is ladies nite :) enjoy you wont be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Service was sub-par for the evening, it was not even that busy.  Food was good, but not amazing, price was reasonable but with the poor service...a bit high.  I have tried here 4-5 times and its showed its true colors as being an average place with good food and a good selection of wine."}
{"text":"I must first say that I've been in the wine business & restaurant industry for 17 plus years, in a fine dining enviroment And, I sell wine during the day. So when I saw a so called up scale wine bar hiring I thought I would apply. So I submitted my resume and they were interested and responded with an interview request. I made an appointment for the interview.  Before I interview at a place I always dine their first on the downlow to check out the food and wine menu and check out the ambience. Thank God I did, food was ok, but lets talk about the wine list. First this is a wine bar and when I go into a wine bar I like to experience new wines. Not name brands like Rombauer Chard, Sanoma Cutter, Silver Oak Cab and to many more to be listed. This bothered me because, any wine driven restaurant I've worked in that claimed to be a wine bar was there to educate and introduce new wines. I saw that they had flights so I went into the interview with an open mind.  When I went into the intervew two days later, I was directed to a table where the manager was sitting and eating. On the table there were three name brand bottles of wine. Funny thing was it was Rombauer Chard, Sanoma Cutter and Silver Oak Cab. When I sat down told the manager that I liked these named brands but there are better wines at a better price. I couldn't believe what he told me!! He told me that he puts name brands on purpose so they would sell, I was shocked. Here is a manager who claims that he wants to educate his guests about wine but refuses to put similar wines other than the name brands on his list so that his staff may educate his guests to a new experience at a cheaper price!!  The funniest or should I say the most disturbing thing the manager said during the interview was about his wine education program, he spoke fifteen to twenty minutes about how he wanted to help other restaurants train their staff about wine education. It seems that he was more interested in that than his own staff. When I dine I questioned the service staff about wine and they were clueless. Good Job educating your own staff. Better luck selling your wine education program to other restaurants. So if you want to get ripped off and have ok food and WAY over priced wine please go, thats exactly what you'll get. You've been warned. They are trouble. Go to one of Postino's Wine Bars instead or Kazimirz a real WIne Bar ! ! ! !"}
{"text":"Great service, delicious food and a very nice outdoor patio to enjoy dinner. As the evening progressed live music was a great attraction. We had the Mac n Cheese (written up in Phoenix Magazine and well-deserved) and the Salmon over Butternut Squash Risotto. Delicious food all-around, served with a light white wine, recommended by the staff. We enjoyed a wonderful dinner and were happy to know that is was right around the corner from our new home in Chandler. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"All I can say is fabulous everything!  My favorite place to go with the hubby and our children.  Great musicians and ambiance.  The wine list is unparalleled."}
{"text":"Great time at D'vine tonight! Wednesday wine tasting and our awesome server Tak were the highlights, plus the tasty short ribs. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"After being greeted and seated, we received water and menus. And then we waited, and waited and waited some more. We were never approached by the wait staff and never had an opportunity to order a drink. I personally gave this establishment one more try as this was similar to a previous visits a few years ago.  I will never go back"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time with my mom and sister. We didn't make it for happy hour, but I've heard they have great options for happy hour.  My mom ordered fish and chips, sister ordered angel hair pasta with shrimp, I ordered Angel hair pasta with sausage and fra diavolo sauce. My mom loved her fish and chips, my sister and I loved the flavor of the pasta, but a little too much sauce vs pasta ratio. Management made sure to bring it back and keep us updated, and made sure we were satisfied. Definitely big props to the male manager tonight 1/24 at around 7ish! Very kind and attentive  I know we all have bad days, however, we did notice our server had a bad attitude from the second we sat down & we felt our business wasn't wanted from her- or she had no pride for where she worked? It was odd, and something all 3 of us observed   One ex: my mom: \"what's your soup for today?\" Server: \"chicken and vegetable. It's salty.\" Me: \"how would you describe the fra diavolo sauce?\" Server: \"it's spicy.\"  Hmmm. Ok! I ended up loving the fra diavolo sauce, but definitely not because she made it seem like a good choice by her description or tone, lol  I was a restaurant server for 5 years at a resort in N Scottsdale so I know how important it is to yes, be honest, but also talk up the food that the restaurant serves?? Explain better to get people intrigued? Offer something else that you personally love? Smile and be personable? Interact with guests? All was non- existent. This is a bistro/ wine bar.. not a sports bar, yes? Prices would confirm. It was strange because we were nothing but kind to her from the moment we sat & still tipped 20%, but sensed some major tude the entire time for some reason ?   The three stars are for the food after being resolved (yum! If you like a spicy, tomato based sauce- try the fra diavolo)... and managements involvement. They also offered complimentary wine to which was greatly appreciated!! Service by waitress was very disappointing to be honest. I don't live in the area, and honestly wouldn't personally come back, I just hope my mom doesn't get that server again"}
{"text":"Haven't been  D Vines for a number of years glad we came back. Wait staff very well trained tentative but not overbearing. We had A6 o'clock reservation but arrived a few minutes early glad we did because we were able to order the muscles off the early bird menu they were outstanding. Kudos to the chef for using local Queen Creek olives for his smoked olive Bowl it was incredible. Don't pass on the calamari it was Top Notch!"}
{"text":"Went out for a relaxing evening last night. Food was not as good as usual so that was disappointing, I had the coconut shrimp. The server was very gracious and didn't charge us when she learned we didn't enjoy it. On our way out we decided to sit out on the patio to listen to the music.  Two guys on bass and keyboard, they made the evening!We'll definitely go back and enjoy the wine and music again."}
{"text":"Two train wreck meals! Version of Mac & Cheese was absolutely horrid! Ingredients on menu sounded good but there was no rescuing this overpriced and under quality concoction. The pork belly was over cooked, the cheese blend had no zing and the bacon was pedestrian. All for $16. The burger as undercooked, nearly raw in the center. The menu didn't list any available sides. We left food on our plates - definitely more than normal. Service was ok but when all the ice melts away from the cucumber infused glass of water, it would have been nice to have the drink refreshed without prompting. Alcohol is the strong suit, but that's just a guess. Call Restaurant Rescue, you need it! Never again!!!"}
{"text":"d'Vine is a great place to eat and drink! While some folks seem to think that the wine is overpriced, now is the time to hit up d'Vine! This summer, they are running many specials on their wines and almost every day there is a different special.  As always, d'Vine's food is always great. I have not had a bad dish at the place in many visits!   The only complaint I have is if you sit toward the front of the restaurant in the 'bar' area, the evening entertainment is too loud and not conducive to having a conversation with your tablemates. Would it really change the music if the musicians were acoustic instead?"}
{"text":"the best street tacos on the planet!! great outside seating, friendly staff and fantastic chef!! we love coming here with friends and family :)"}
{"text":"D-Vine has been a top local fixture for 10+years.  DV is consistently excellent in its culinary offerings...and the vino is pretty good too."}
{"text":"Some friends and I came in for a wine tasting, but ended up being in time for happy hour. Wine tasting was $5 for four samples. We didn't end up doing it, so can't comment on that.  You know it's fancy when there's cucumbers in the water! They're very on top of refills, despite leaving a bottle of water on your table.  Delivery of the wine was extremely slow, very odd.  Happy hour included $5 glasses of wine and some random munchies. My only complaint would be the portion size of the happy hour food. Small! One slider (BBQ beef) and a small handful of fries ($6). Tasty, but small. We also tried the mac n cheese balls. Nice presentation, but again, small portion. Normal food prices seemed a little steep as well.  Wine was decent, ambiance is nice, service was good, and live music started at 7pm."}
{"text":"NW corner, if you couldn't eyeball it very well from the Google map.  Our lunch group of 12 came, and not one bad review.  The girl sitting next to me could not stop helping herself to my fries, they were seriously that good.  These were no normal McD good quality fries... this was gourmet fries... if they had a drive thru, I'd come here for the fries alone.    Ok but seriously, 12 of us had a large variety of menu offerings and everyone was gobbling it up.  The waitress completely surprised us by being willing to split our checks, how cool is she?!"}
{"text":"We have been going to this restaurant and wine bar for years. Love the remodel. Food is always good, they offer interesting specials. The patio is very nice and the staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"I love the happy hour here!  This is a cute wine bar in Chandler. It is on the smaller side, but cozy. We sat at the bar and ordered our drinks. They have great drink deals during happy hour that starts at 2pm!  The food options are $2.00 of all Tapas and 1/2 off the bruschetta menu. I love their bruschetta. There are like 6 different flavors to choose from. You get to pick three different kinds and you get two of each. One order is huge and its only $4.50. I do suggest that you stay away from the salmon bruschetta, not very good. My favs are the brie with apples and almonds, and the artichoke hearts with goat cheese and red pepper pesto. Yummo!  I have had dinner here once awhile ago and it was good, but I have not been recently. I stick to their happy hour, it is a ton of food!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and service. Enjoyed the entire experience. I would recommend anyone in the Chandler area to visit this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Love the fact that a few years later its still wonderful place!  The staff is wonderful and the presentation is always good at reasonable prices for what it is. Like the fact that there are nights with live soft bands, small, but modern great place. We do enjoy their food and wines are great! :)"}
{"text":"We stayed at the Hotel next door and walked over to the D'Vine Bistro for a snack and beverage. What a great find! It was so much fun, the servers and guests were all so friendly, and the small plates were delicious. After tasting the food, we stayed for dinner. Really looking forward to our next trip to Chandler so we can eat there again!"}
{"text":"The best restaurant close to my house.  Everyone loves the apps (hummus and bruschetta are our favorites), the salmon, chicken fried chicken, handmade pasta, and salads.  I always get the street tacos appetizer as my main and everyone begs me for a taste.  Sometimes, it's a little hard to get a seat, but it's to be expected.  Rock on D'Vine!  I'll be back..."}
{"text":"Love their appetizers!  It is a little too pricey to visit more than once a month though."}
{"text":"Had the calamari, different, but very good. The short rim was great; however, the blue cheese potatoes (WOW) was amazing!!! Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"The wine flight for Pinot Noir was from La Creme and it was delicious! Happy hour white sangria was excellent as well. I wasn't a fan of the bruschetta and the happy hour salad had too much basalmic vinegar. They had a great live music and the crowd for a Saturday night was a more older, mature crowd."}
{"text":"I love this place.  All of my coworkers and I love it here.  We all agree it's the best food around, and we agree it's the best bang for our buck.  We go to far lesser or respectful places to eat, even fast food type places, spend more, get less, and get FAR LESS quality in the food and cooking.  For both work and personal we take out of town people here every time.  The first time I took my girlfriend here she fell in love with it.  The staff is friendly, normal, knowledgeable, actually will talk and hold good conversation.  The atmosphere is great, though it can be a little loud for some people but it doesn't bother me at all.  I highly recommend going here to get away from the norm and to have great food every single time you go.  I've never been disappointed here once."}
{"text":"One of my favorite secrets of the Valley. I had my 26th birthday here with about 10 friends and my boyfriend, and the staff was so incredibly accomodating. The staff told the musician that night that it was my birthday and yes, I was serenaded by him to \"Happy Birthday.\" I would have normally refused, but everyone was in such good spirits that night. I've been back a few times after and each experience has been great.  The food is amazing and the wine selection is among the very best, considering we are in Arizona. The reds are probably my favorite there. Whether you are there for a celebration or just a quick drink, you'll definitely leave satisfied."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the food and service. First time having a meal there since new owner(s) took over. The food was very bland had to ask for refills on our water. If you want a glass of wine for happy hour great just don't expect much from the food."}
{"text":"I made a reservation for 14 people during our visit to the valley during Christmas.  It was my 3rd visit and each time I was impressed by the service, quality of the food and wine selection!!  A great place!!"}
{"text":"This is my place!!! I walk in and they know my name! I love the food and the service. They make the best Filet in Mesa and have the best wine in Mesa! I will come sometimes 2 or 3 times a week and their happy hour Tapas and wine and beer for 5.00 can't be beat!  I'm so glad to see David is back as the GM. His knowledge in wine is excellent and his customer service is top notch!"}
{"text":"The food, wine selection and atmosphere here is D'vine! So glad we found this little gem in South Chandler.  Our only issue was that we were rushed out of here by our server, Ryan, who literally as soon as we were finished eating, brought us the bill. No we didn't ask for it, and apparently Ryan forgot that he works at a WINE BAR where patrons typically stay a while and enjoy the wine, unlike a fast-paced restaurant where the goal is to turn tables all night. And apparently Ryan also needs to learn how to read social cues, as we were still enjoying our conversation with friends, and hadn't even finished our bottle of wine. We had planned to order another bottle and stay a while longer, but after the second time he checked back to inquire if we were ready to pay, we decided it was time to leave and take our business elsewhere.   Despite our experience with being rushed out of here, we still plan to go back and try it out again...and hopefully, we'll get a server who allows us to take our time and enjoy."}
{"text":"We went to D'Vine for the first time in a long time.  The food was as good as ever but the service left something to be desired.  We were seated at a table for 2 - the table measured about 2 feet square.  We had several question on the wine list and the wait person was less knowledgeable than I would expect at a wine bar.  He did not offer to send a sommelier to answer our questions but he did come back with a vague answer.  We ordered 2 wine flights.  We then ordered 3 small plates - stuffed mushroom (excellent), tuna poke (also excellent and a large portion) and street tacos (excellent as well).  All 3 small plates were delivered at the same time.  With the wine flights already on the table there was not room for the food.  I would suggest the small plates be delivered one at a time.  The food also got cold while we were eating the other plates.  Also, the food we selected did not complement the wine - quite the opposite.  At a place the represents itself to be a wine bar, I would expect wait staff that was familiar with the wine list and would make recommendations of complementary food and wine.  Overall, the food was excellent but we won't go back soon."}
{"text":"Had a delicious dinner with my Mom and youngest brother last Friday.  And how much fun we had.    It was a little busy so we were offered a 20 minute wait or a table outside - it was about 5:30, HOT HOT HOT.  Well, the patio was shaded and had the misters on full blast.  We were seated and proceeded to down our glasses of water till we acclimated to the warmth.  Acclimated to the warmth, I said that..  Needless to say, Erica, our waitress, was very nice and helpful in explaining some of the menu items.  To start, we had the bruschetta - I thought two of the three we ordered were tasty and the third was the one to fight for.  The choices included the traditional, the caprese, and the prosciutto.  For dinner, Mom ordered the fish & chips, which she loved and almost didn't share; Brother had the cheese pizza with pepperoni and sausage, he loved it; and I ordered the espresso BBQ boneless short rib, which I thought was very yummy.  I shared.  Dessert, since we were celebrating my youngest brother's military promotion, was the  chocolate kahlua toffee mousse cake and the apple crumble pie.  Delish.  If ever in the neighborhood again, I will definitely go back.  Everyone of the staff, from the hostess, to Erica, to the water lady, and finally, to the food bearer, all were fantastic and friendly."}
{"text":"This place is a great little lunch spot. The service is friendly and efficient and the food was very good. The fried chicken unwrapped was one of the best wraps I have ever eaten. I would definitely recommend this place if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Came here with three other couples and had a nice evening.  We were there for an early happy hour but we did order some food and a few glasses of wine and brews.  I had the pumpkin porter by Four Peaks which was delicious as always.  The wines were solid and not horribly priced with the happy hour $2/off.    The fish tacos were very good as were their salt and pepper shrimp which were huge (like U12's) which was a nice surprise.  The rest of our group seemed to enjoy their food as well including wine.  Service was the only down side here.  The server seemed bothered because in fairness we were unorganized and never ready to order etc when she was there.  Some in the group were  talking a lot and I can certainly appreciate how annoying a \"clueless\" group can as I used to work in the biz but she did not even try to roll with the punches.  Stern faced, no laughs despite attempts to joke with her...yadda ya.... oh well.  Drinks took a while to be refilled and I often found myself wanting for a new beer.  Food was promptly served however and it was nice and hot.  A great blues musician came on at about 6:30 or so who was very good.  I wish I had known he was coming because I would have stayed.  I will likely come back just for him and to give this place another shot at impressing me.  The last star got knocked off when the server auto-grat'ed our check @ 20%.  I get we were a table of 8 and I get that some waiters do this to protect themselves from getting stiffed with large tables.  If you are going to auto-grat however you should at least provide exceptional service and use 15% so that guests can add 5%-10% if you were good."}
{"text":"My friend picked this place and I was excited to try it. Super cozy, great service, good selection of red wine's. We were able to still have a conversation even with the live music.  I had the Risotto which was cooked perfectly and very tasty. We shared a tiramisu which was good, not as good as mine! but really good. Server was friendly and helpful. Wine was reasonably priced for a glass. Music was good. There was a live singer around 8ish. The bill was not as much as I would have expected for a place like this. I got out for around $40 for a glass of higher priced red wine, risotto, dessert, and tip.   I think this would be a fantastic date restaurant...now just to find the date!"}
{"text":"This place is elegance personified.  Unbelievable service.  Excellent,  extensive wine menu.  Interesting mixed drinks.  And a really neat fall menu (I'll take one of everything to go please). There is a little something for everyone.  I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Had an amazing lunch experience @ D'Vine Bistro & Wine!   My sister had the Ahi Tuna( lunch portion) with sweet potato fries and said it was exceptional!  I had the Buttermilk Fried Chicken Unwrapped( think chicken wrap but not folded). Yummy!   Our server, Erika,was friendly,knowledgeable and the food turned amazingly well for a very reasonable price.  I can see why Yelp reviewers ranked this highly #4 in Chandler.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My friend & I were scoping out lunch options in south Chandler & came across D'Vine Bistro. For the first time (I think ever?) I didn't check out their menu but rather decided I'd just make up mind on a whim. Well, at first glance at the menu, the salmon cakes salad sounded absolutely perfect! Our waiter came around to get our order & told us that they were out of the salmon cakes! Back to the drawing board, I thought, but he went to check & the chef said that he'd be making some if I was willing to wait for about 20 minutes.  When my dish arrived it was a bit disappointing. The salmon cakes were really mostly just the thick outer coating & not too much salmon. The salad dressing was really good but I probably would skip on this dish next time. My friend got some of the tapas plates which I had a couple of bites of. Again, they were nothing spectacular .. All were just okay. We also got the creme brûlée for dessert - probably the best thing there! The top sugar layer was perfectly crunchy & the middle was smooth, creamy, & delicious. I'd think about going here for just that!  The service was a bit lacking since we had to ask for refills & flag our waiter down to order dessert. Overall, the experience was just okay."}
{"text":"We were ignored by the servers, received the wrong wine on a re-order and the food was disappointing. I will not come back."}
{"text":"I'm visiting from LA and used to nice wine bars...this one was pretty good. Nice ambiance, live soft music, great wine and cheese platter. Decent beet salad."}
{"text":"Has been about 6 months since we have eaten at Divine.  Our server was rude. He kept rolling his eyes as if he didn't want to be working.  I ordered a hamburger and it was so burnt.  Awful!!"}
{"text":"Never had a meal I didn't like.   We wish we could go more often.  Great happy hour snacks.  I highly recommend calling in for a reservation for Friday or Saturday  night."}
{"text":"Our first time there tonight (date night). Great atmosphere! Friendly and not too noisy even with live music. Great food had the spaghetti with meatballs and the chicken with Cajun Alfredo and angel hair pasta that were delicious.  Had a killer old fashioned too. Ask for Tiffany..excellent service and friendly"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and wine. Nice patio and music. Happy hour is a great value as well. We come here for girls dinners a lot."}
{"text":"Superb food, drinks and ambiance ! Chef Rice's team and Aaron our knowledgable waiter made the evening surprisingly delightful . Do try the Salmon cakes from the Tapas menu. The Kryan pizza is terrific and my wife couldn't say anything but superlatives about the Mac & cheese. The choices of wine and beer are distinguished ."}
{"text":"Today myself and 13 other women from my family showed up at 11:30 a.m. for the reservation we had made for our Mother's Day brunch. I'd been to d'Vine before for dinner and I didn't really have a good, or bad, opinion of the place so when I found out my aunt had chosen this for our annual 'girl time' together I didn't have an opinion one way or the other as to her choice. I have an opinion now...   We are a rather chatty bunch and mimosas were included so we didn't place our brunch orders until around noon. It was about 1/2 an hour after our orders had been placed that our server, Michael (who himself did a good job) came out to let us know that the chef was actually gone to the grocery store having had a 'lull' in orders, leaving only the sous chef in the kitchen, so our food would be a delayed coming out. It was approximately 45 minutes later that our food, quite staggered, was served. A couple of people had finished their meals before the others even got their food.    The saddest part of our experience wasn't even that. It was this...when a gentlemen who appeared to be a GM or owner (I asked him his title and never received an answer. I had to ask the server later, once my conversation with this person who appeared to play some sort of leadership role, was over) came out to the patio at the time we were paying our bills I asked him if he knew what had transpired with our party. He responded with a 'no' so I proceeded forward with what happened. He came across as uninterested as a person could possibly be, even folding his arms and putting his hand to his chin while I spoke. We received a very sad 'sorry' and he asked us if we would care for free dessert (as we're all paid and ready to walk out the door). That was it.    Heads up, Mr. Owner. You might want to brush up on your public relations. My profession is public relations and marketing and you shouldn't have walked away the way you did from 14 guests in your business without leaving us with the desire to return to give you another shot.. I can only speak for myself but considering I didn't feel like a 'guest' I probably won't be returning. You never even gave me your position/title or name when I addressed you.   Your service left a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"Ok I'm flipping astonished I walked in and was seated right away at 7pm even if it is Thursday night.    My first thought after the \"pig wings\" was \"wow this is some of the finest fare I've ever eaten after a walk across a hotel parking lot!\"  After the ancho spice rubbed grill pork tenderloin over roasted corn- goat cheese polenta with a habanero vinaigrette and green tomatillo aioli, I realized I was wrong.  I've literally dined around the globe and saying this is in the top 5 dining experiences is saying a lot.  I am kinda struggling to name the other 4 at the moment.   Bruno, Eric & Mike are great hosts.  Are they owners, managers?  Nope bartender, chef and waiter!  Jeez, I wish two things, that this place was nearby my home because I'd be a regular and that IF I ever own an eatery these guys were Stewarts of my business & reputation!  Oh I met Robert the owner, he's no slouch either.  He's gathered a fine crew.  You need to experience this place."}
{"text":"We first dined at D'Vine a few weeks ago when looking for a new place.  I looked at some of their menu items online, and I was impressed.  The salmon with risotto was amazing!!  I love salmon, but it is so tough to find it cooked to perfection in a restaurant.  The portion seemed small, but it was very filling and left no room for dessert.    We returned today with our adult daughter.  We split the salmon cakes salad as an appetizer, and I again ordered salmon.  For lunch, it was served over mashed potatoes with a delicious sauce with capers.  Yum!  My husband and daughter ordered some fried chicken.  It looked like a fancy wrap.  The only issue is there was a bug (gnat) on my daughter's chicken.  She alerted the server who got a new order prepared for her.  The place looks super CLEAN, so I want to assume the bug came from the door being opened.  Luckily it was my daughter's plate, because for me, I would have lost my appetite.  Actually, I was too busy enjoying the salmon..... :-) I guess it would have been nice if they had offered a discount on her dish for the inconvenience.  We can afford to eat where we want, but $80 for a lunch for 3 is kind of expensive and we don't expect mishaps if we are paying that price.    The cheesecake was ok.  It tasted like it had been previously frozen and was super cold.  I like it between room temp and cold, but my daughter loved it.    I will definitely be back for the salmon menu items.  Service has been great as well.  Portions look small, but they are very filling.  **11/15  After returning a few times, 100% for salmon, I am sorry to say that the service is sometimes horrible.  I am not sure if we're returning, unless I am craving their salmon again.  We will be looking for a place with great food AND consistent service."}
{"text":"We've been here several times and we've never had a bad meal. The drinks are wonderful - my favorite is the French martini (I don't remember the full name but that is close).  We've tried quite a few items on the menu and the only one that was just ok is the fish tacos - they were strange because the piece of fish they used was so big.  The stuffed portabello is good, the street tacos are good, the beef & mushroom risotto was ok, the Krisi flatbread is AWESOME, and the bruschetta was good as well.    We will be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"My brother and sister go here all the time and rave about it! I went with them one time and loved it. The food was great, the bar tender Ruben was amazing, the owners were sweet. Little spendy but I would say the quality matches the price."}
{"text":"The first impression when we walked in was:  The menus were scattered all over the Hostess stand in no order. The service was horrible on the patio, non existent. Not sure why - maybe because, one large party occupied the entire wait staff???? Good reviews, but our experience was a complete -0-. Would NOT recommend, and I'm not coming back. What a bummer, so close to home! The wait for food was sooooo long, I forgot what I ordered. Update:  ORDERED Food, approximately 30 minutes and nothing!!!!!!  NO ONE CAME TO OUR TABLE TO CHECK ON US - NOT ONCE!!!!!!! EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED- WILL NOT RECOMMEND to any of my friends or on NEXT DOOR."}
{"text":"In South Chandler it seems you can either get good food or good service, but not both. That is unless you go to D'Vine! My wife and I try to do \"Date Lunch\" while my daughter is in school once a week and they always amaze. Great food, great wine and a super friendly crew make this our favorite treat!"}
{"text":"Came in this weekend and Dustin served us. He was very knowledgeable about the menu and wine selection. The meatballs he suggested were incredible! He made us feel comfortable and gave excellent service.  Can't wait to come back and see him!"}
{"text":"The Mac n Cheese is amazing and their happy hour specializes for appetizers is unbeatable. Great place to go and relax for a bit.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Food is always outstanding and the service top notch! We love Rueben and Mike - best bartenders! The chef always has creative and yummy food specials! We take friends here often - the happy hour is awesome!"}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch on a Sunday afternoon. Was pleasantly surprised. The brisket and smoked sausage was great!! Brisket was moist and great flavor.  The sides were not that great and they have Pepsi products. Yuk! All in all, we will go back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried this little place several months ago, and it quickly became our go-to \"date night\" spot.  The atmosphere is the perfect intimate setting for a quiet night out.  We usually go on Friday nights, when they have a live musician.  (You would think Friday nights would be packed, but we've never had to wait for a table.)  I'm not always a fan of acoustic guitar music, but the guy they have playing is actually quite good!  The chill music, combined with low lighting, create a calming, romantic mood.  Neither of us knows much about wine, so we love the fact that the waiters are so knowledgeable and able to suggest the perfect bottle for us to split.  Their \"wine flights\" are great, too... they allow us to sample a few smaller pours of different wines without committing to a whole bottle.  We've never actually eaten any of the entrees at D'Vine.  They have such a wide variety of appetizers, which are always amazing!  We generally choose two or three to split.  Our favorites are the spinach artichoke dip and the bruchetta.  Last time, I tried a new shrimp dish, which was incredible.  If you're looking for a quiet, romantic spot for a night out with someone special, I definitely recommend D'Vine."}
{"text":"Wasn't able to try the food,  due to the fact there was a thirty minute wait but no where to wait and no way to get notified that the table was ready. The hostess said she would only hold a hold for five minutes, yet I could make a reservation to hold a table a minimum of one hour in advance. Even though there were 3 four top tables empty, I'd assume for people with a reservation.  It would be nice if foh managers would teach and emphasize to the hostess first impressions are huge and that bad word of mouth travels much faster."}
{"text":"So this place is like 3min away from our place and we did hear some nice things about it so we decided to give it a try.  It was a Saturday night so parking was hard to find and the restaurant was very lively.  It's kinda weird to see several people exercising at the next door gym when you are about to go into the restaurant but I digress.  Our wait was not too bad, just 15min or so.    We tried the presciutto and smoked salmon bruschetta first.  They were very nicely done.  The presciutto and pine nuts were a good combination.  For our entrees, I tried the rib eye and my bf tried the bistro burger.  The rib eye was huge and the sauce was very nice but honestly, the rib eye was over done.  Overall, it was.....average.  The bistro burger had potential.  The burger came with artichoke/spinach spread on focaccia bread.  The idea is nice but I was more impressed with the presentation over taste.  The moment you bite into it, you can't help but to say to yourself \"...oh....\"  The bread was very fluffy and soft.  I think it would have been better if the bread was served alone.  Would we go back?.....b/c it is so close, MAYBE for lunch.  *Service = our waiter was probably new....he was going crazy serving all the tables. *Food = ok.  It was nothing special really. *Price = a little too much for the quality of food they serve *Ambiance/decor = you know, at first glance, it looks like it is an upscale restaurant but it isn't."}
{"text":"I lived down the road from this great place, they have great wine varieties and some tasty dishes. But if you are foody, there isn't a large variety for you here. The wine tender, Blake is always friendly and manages to get my group of ladies to try new flavors each time. Moscatto...delish!  Great atmosphere, intimate, formal or casual; a great time to be had by all. Great indoor and outdoor seating."}
{"text":"The happy hour is great, haven't had a thing that wasn't super yummy on the menu.  They also do wine tastings and their staff is really knowledgeable on wine and the menu.  The spicy edamame is awesome and they make a pretty good creme brule.  If you are in the area you should stop by for a nice class of wine in a laid back atmosphere."}
{"text":"My first but not last visit.   I highly recommend the salmon cakes, they were just lovely!  My sister  visiting from San Jose was not going to eat anything. That didn't last, she can vouch for the salmon cakes. I changed my second order of salmon cakes to calamari. Calamari strips are not my favorite, I prefer the little squid with the tentacles, I should have asked. My niece ordered fried chicken with mac and cheese. The mac was made with a mild cheese,  a bit too suddle for my palette.  My niece wasn't impressed with the chicken, said it wasn't bad just not seasoned very well. Later she said anyone can fry chicken it's the seasoning that sets it apart.  Yes she is a fried chicken expert, just like I'm a fried catfish expert.  Back to my review.... Our waitress Kendra was attentive without being overbearing. Overall good food made better with good company and good service... I will visit the one on Power if  next time I have a visitor....  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Just moved to the area, and decided to go to D'vine with my husband for some drinks and dinner. Overall, the experience was good, as the service was great and the food came out quickly. The food, however, was mediocre. We ordered the bruschetta board, avocado salad thing and the habanero jalapeño chicken to share. The bruschetta was just okay, as I was expecting a fluffier, larger slice of bread. The avocado salad thing was basically just arugula with avocado and oranges on top, and the chicken was tasty, but could have been Tyson anytizers for all we know. There was also feta or cotija cheese sprinkles on each dish to make it appear more desirable. Nothing we ordered was bad, it just tasted like standard dishes we could have made ourselves at home.    We may be back for just drinks, as the happy hour prices are great. However, we probably won't be ordering food again."}
{"text":"09.04.10  Great little place! Great service! Great Food!  We ordered Happy Hour Appetizers: Mushroom Fries, Mini Cuban Sandwich and Mixed Green Salad.  All were YUMMY!  Definitely a place we'll visit again next time we're on that side of the Valley!"}
{"text":"Five reasons I gave d'Vine Wine five stars:  1. Sixto, our waiter. Cute, charming and patient. 2. Parmesan truffle fries. Yummy. 3. Beef & Gouda Melt. To die for. 4. Relaxed, but sophisticated vibe. I felt comfortable and cool. 5. The wine. Hello. Lots to choose from, and the Sauvignon Blanc I had was fantastic!  Only downfall? It is waaaaay the heck out there, especially from north central Phoenix. But... if I'm ever in that area again, I'll definitely make a point to stop by. It was certainly d-vine."}
{"text":"Great wine bar for a happy hour or a date night. The appetizers, wine, and main dishes are high quality for reasonable prices.   I love the cheese platter and fish tacos especially!  I really like the number of small dishes they have too so you can snack on multiple items without feeling stuffed at the end. The waitstaff here has always been great too."}
{"text":"I would love to give a bad review so this place doesn't get too busy, but the truth of the matter is I love this place. Great music, great staff, amazing atmosphere and reasonable prices combine to make D'Vine a fantastic place to spend an evening. The food is excellent, which only makes this place a must-try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Living in Mesa is like being exiled on the island of food mediocrity. D'Vine marches right in line with the others with their lackluster menu, poor execution of the food they do offer and over inflated self with their high prices.  If Mesa had other options for food and wine this place would sink.  I have been here more times than I like to admit, not because the food is memorable and draws me back but because I no other option in the area.  Heavy sauces don't cover up poor ingredients. Soggy flat bread never holds up to a $14 price tag. Bruschetta will always taste like dry bread if the quality of ingredients taste like Walmart. Prepackaged frozen desserts will ruin every evening no matter how much fruit sauce you poor on top.  I think D'Vine can do better. Mesa needs to up their standards and ask for it."}
{"text":"Great little place. Tak our waitress was terrific. The street tacos were the best we have had! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I can not stand this restaurant. Every time I go the food is inconsistent.  I've had the \"Dave's Special\" (not on menu but my co-worker goes so much there is a dish named after him) with salmon, sauteed spinach, pasta, and tomatoes tossed in olive oil.  I've given this dish a try a couple of  times and each was different. Once the fish portion was slight but the spinach was perfectly sauteed and wilted. Second time, the fish portion was large but we had a BIG bowl of spinach, little bit of pasta and hardly any tomatoes and the spinach was raw - never touched the skillet.   So I give another dish on the menu a try - the appetizer of bruschetta with prosciutto, brie, apple, 3 different types. The brie was all rind and the prosciutto is like the kind you get at the Albertson's deli.  Really!? I no longer frequent this restaurant and boycott it if its an option for an office birthday lunch."}
{"text":"I've been going to D'Vine for over 10 years. Here's some tips for diners: 1) Check out the \"Specials\" menu on their website before deciding to go on a particular night. Most of the Specials menu changes daily. You'll catch the opportunity to try some amazing dishes that you'd otherwise miss 2) If there is something on the Specials menu that you REALLY want, call them to make sure they will still have enough by the time you get there.   Sometimes the really outstanding dishes will be sold out by 7 or 8pm. Alternatively, just get there as soon as 'dinner' starts. 3) There is a \"Happy Hour\" menu that is different than the normal dinner menu.  If you want something off that menu, get there before Happy Hour is over or you might not get what you want. 4) Parking: There is parking on the backsides of the buildings in this shopping center. If the normal lot is full, check for spots out back. 5) Check if there is a musician playing, a special event or group reservation before you go, esp during the summer. There isn't a lot of room inside for dining (maybe 30 guests tops can fit inside including seating at the bar).  If you are adverse to sitting outside for any reason, you'll be glad you did.  Criticisms: 1) Filet Mignon IS always on the Special's Menu. Yeah, they vary it up with sauces and sides, but if it is ALWAYS on your menu, it isn't \"Special\". 2) Desserts:  They have had basically the same desserts for over a decade.  Diners do get tired of the same dessert offerings. 3) Over-reliance on broccolini / asparagus.  There are almost endless options for sides to accompany a main dish.  Why do these 2 things get repeated over and over ? 4) Portion size for seafood.  $27 for 4 scallops on polenta is not a filling meal nor is it a great value.  They actually had a dish once with a SINGLE scallop. I failed to catch that and ended up with the most expensive scallop serving I've ever had in my life. 5) Music: Sometimes it is ok, sometimes when you've got the D'Vine musician on the patio battling with the Pacino's (restaurant next door) musician on their patio, it just feels like cacophony.  Furthermore, when it is summer and 117F outside, if there is a musician INSIDE, diners are forced to choose between being able to have a conversation or being in air conditioning while they eat.   This needs to be thought out a lot more. 6) Update the Specials Menu on your website !  We don't always want to call to have it read to us.  That said, this is the ONLY place to go for high end food in north east Mesa. The food is consistently excellent, the chef is one of the best and is willing to take chances and the staff is attentive without being annoying."}
{"text":"Pass me some hummus! D-vine is a small wine bar in mesa, which has excellent food.  I hadn't been there for a few years, so was expecting the food quality to have gone down, since they've opened up another location and that typically means the food begins to taste \"Chainy\".  This was not the case at all, (good thing because we had terrible service).   I'm going to give them somewhat of a pass on the service, because it was Saturday night and the place was packed.   I'm just glad we caught the extra $44 we were charged for our wine, before we left the building.  Okay, now back to the food.    We started off with a hummus tray, the pita bread was amazing! It was perfectly grilled and seasoned,  I could have eaten the whole plate.  For dinner, I ordered the mac- n-cheese without the pork, sub veggies.   The rest of the table ordered a flat iron steak, filet, and chicken, these came out perfectly cooked and with decent portion sizes.  I know this because I waited almost 10 minutes for my pasta to come out, after they had been served.  When my food came out it was a bowl of pasta with more of an alfredo sauce, a little cheese crisped on top then covered in veggies (Including potatoes which was weird).  It was very good, but didn't resemble a mac-n- cheese at all.  I was also a little annoyed, because they charged me and extra $3 for the veggies even though I didn't get the pork.  For dessert we had their prickly pear crème brulee special... omg it was amazing!  I'm glad we finished the meal off strong, because the service was train wreck from beginning to end, which is the only reason D-vine is not receiving a 4, or maybe even a 5 star rating (which is very rare for me).   Despite the service, we still had a nice dinner and will definitely be back.   I am looking forward to getting an opportunity to update my rating and enjoying some delicious food and wine."}
{"text":"Fabulous and unique food menu for all palates. Great drink menu to compliment the food. Awesome atmosphere and service."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and fantastic happy hour! Favorite spot in Mesa:)"}
{"text":"We have been here several times, including my recent birthday. I always go at Happy hour because they have several dishes only at that time. My daughter's favorite is the sweet potato fries. I really like the bruscetta here. Nice variation on the traditional with lots of flavor. Burgers are always good. I have gotten Sea Bass many times and most were delicious. We have had some misses. Risotto was very salty once and made us slightly ill afterward, burger was burnt once. Some servers have been excellent, but service is slow, which may be more due to the kitchen than the servers. Wine is good, though wine knowledge is inconsistent. Still, this is about the best East Valley bistro and works well for families as well as adults."}
{"text":"I usually love the food food here.  This place is usually a top pick for anniversaries or date night. The handmade pasta is always excellent and my husband always orders whatever version they have on the menu that night.  He comments that the portion sizes continue to get smaller and he always misses the lack of bread with his meal.  Great wine choices,  great beer choices,  great staff, great atmosphere (for a romantic first date or casual drinks).  Generally a little pricey especially if you order drinks with dinner.  There are reasonably priced entrees as well but the menu has been moving towards more and more pretentious over the years.  Our last visit I ordered venison with a pumpkin/corn/potato succotash type side.  I wasn't impressed at all (especially for 35.00$).  We will continue to come for dinner and drinks but I think we're on the market for a new favorite."}
{"text":"In regards to the D'Vine Bistro of Chandler, I've been here twice and can assure you, I'll not be returning for a third.   The first time a girlfriend of mine and I just sat at the bar and had a glass of wine. All was fine. You really can't go wrong just pouring a glass of wine.  The second time we got a table and ordered dinner. Initially I sat at the bar to wait for a table. I ordered from an unfriendly bar tender yet they were out of All labels of Shiraz and Syrah ( How does a wine bar run out of wine?). The food was mediocre at best. The service was horrific. Our server asked for our drink orders and excused himself before we could get our drink order out of our mouths. He did not return for another 15 minutes. Once we ordered our entrees we didn't see him for another 45 minutes. We waited an additional 20 minutes after that just to order a 2nd glass of wine. He then asked us if we'd like to see a desert menu, we said yes and of course that took another 20 minutes until he returned with the menu. Following desert, another 20 minute wait for the bill. We were there for 3 hours with no exaggeration, just eating Cheese & Fruit, a salad and two glasses of wine.   Because they ran out of wine, because the bar tender was unfriendly, because the food took very long to receive, and because the server was incompetent and neglectful... I'll not be returning here."}
{"text":"Ended up here by accident after organizing a double date to an event that took place the day before. Anyways, this was actually a much welcomed discovery.  The wait was like 15 minutes, but they have this cush couch lounge area to chill. On the particular weekend we went, there was a guitarist and vocalist (who wasn't actually that good) to keep you busy. Either way, it was a nic area to chat with friends and be comfortable while we waited.   The bruschetta here is tops, even better than Postino's.  In order of my favorites Marinated Artichoke, Smoked Salmon, Traditional, and Caprese. In retrospect, I should have just ordered more of the marinated artichoke, it was just so juicy and put a bang in my mouth.  For pizza, I got something called the KRISTI...I had ordered it without bacon....but when it was brought out - I think there was extra bacon on it. So i had to send it back and waited another 15 minutes than I wanted to for my food, but hey people make mistakes no biggie. The fact that she refilled my water the second that bad boy was empty really made me forget about it. The pizza has red onions, grilled chicken, sliced jalapeños, cilantro and tomatoes.  I hear they have good happy hour so give it a shot and if you just want a nice place to hang out with friends on the weekend, this is a pretty good plcae to do just that."}
{"text":"Rueben is an amazing bartender.  Food and atmosphere wonderful.  Brian who plays music in Friday nights is the very best"}
{"text":"We are staying next door at the hotel and I think it's great that this restaurant is right next door! We've been there twice already. We were first there Saturday night for drinks and desserts and they had live music. The performer was great as well as the atmosphere. We ordered a chocolate mousse cake and coffee. Their coffee tasted so good that I was able to drink it straight black without the added cream and sugar. Their dessert was so good that we walked over the next night for more dessert."}
{"text":"Loved happy hour - $2.50 microbrews, $5 appetizers (WAY better appetizers than your average place, though they could do to expand the options...sizes are a bit small but they're forgiven b/c the appetizers are unique and taste SO good...oh and the size of the appetizer salads ARE generous).  Friendly staff!  My friend LOVES the generous pour on their wines (especially during happy hour)."}
{"text":"We had a really good experience here!  We wanted to try a new, local place and because we drive by here frequently, it was time to give it a try.    After checking out the website and menu ahead of time, we decided there that were lots of food we wanted to try with prices not being so cheap.  Therefore, happy hour on a Saturday from 2-6pm seemed like a great idea.  And it was.    Tapas were 2 dollars off, so we tried the Spinach Artichoke and Caprese.  Caprese was definitely above average for me, and the dip was good as well.  Alrighty.  On to main courses.  I had to order the Mac and Cheese with a side salad, if only because the boyfriend wanted to try it.  Side salad again was more than I expected with dark lettuce, cucumbers, and tomatoes.  The Mac and Cheese was crispy on the top, yum, but we had to ask for salt and pepper to flavor it.  The boyfriend had the Grilled Chicken sandwich, which he says was very tasty.  I had to sneak a couple fries from his plate....they were crispy deliciousness.    Wow, we had a lot of food!  Plenty to take home!  But for all that plus 2 glasses of wine and a big beer it was only $51.00 with tax!  We'll be back for happy hour, and this time will stick to the tapas and drinks."}
{"text":"Went for a work lunch and was impressed.  The ambiance is relaxing and simple.  The menu has some fun items.  My glass of D'Vine Pinot Grigio was tasty.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their food and everything looked yummy with the exception of the cheese plate.  It seemed meager and boring...  I ordered the bruschetta plate.  2 caprese ones, 2 brie and almond ones and 2 chipotle/avocado.  Delicious and the perfect amount of food for a lunch.  My favorite of the three flavors was the caprese.  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"The chef at this place is kind of a cocky jerk (censored). We were here for a corporate event and I asked three people about a peanut allergy concern. Someone finally told me that he wasn't available but then I saw him later and asked him. He was a total jerk about all of it. Not my favorite."}
{"text":"I've ate the past two nights and have enjoyed some of the best food and service I've had in a long time. Very relaxing an enjoyable atmosphere their outside eating area is amazing gas fireplaces and couches make this an incredible place to just hang out and enjoy some wine."}
{"text":"Entered for a light dinner and felt comfortably satisfied. Ordered pizza and fish tacos. All entrees were excellent. Pizza had a comforting buttery aftertaste. Thank you for the attention to detail!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here last night with another couple at 7pm.  Thankfully we had a reservation which gave us a perfect outside table.  The weather was perfect and there was live music so it was great.  The place looks like it gets pretty busy around dinner time so it is probably best to make a reservation if you have a larger party.  I honestly wasn't expecting this place to be as good as it was.  I just didn't think a wine bar in Mesa would serve up the caliber of food this place does.  Almost all the food was excellent and better than just about any wine bar/bistro place I've been to in the valley.  The lamb pops appetizer were rubbed in awesomeness and were perfectly tasty.  And the flat iron steak & polenta were fantastic.  The steak was cooked perfectly, was tender and juicy, and had a great sauce on top.  The polenta was a great compliment.  The homemade peach cobbler for dessert was also excellent and perfect to share.  The only thing I didn't care for was the bruschetta.  It was pretty weak.  Very thin slices of bread with 'eh toppings with ok flavor.  I was expecting much better.  The service was very friendly but they really need more people during peak times because they clearly have too many tables to tend to.  I can't wait to return as they have many other items on the menu I would like to try."}
{"text":"I have been going to D'Vine for years. Its hard to find a good wine bar in Mesa! This place is totally my vibe: awesome selection of wines (that you can buy up front to take home or enjoy while eating dinner), great food - with an ever changing chef's menu, the Bruschettas are amazing, the chocolate cake is to die for, they do live music some of the time, cozy - you can chill on a couch or on the patio by the fire... and they always have new art on the wall for sale by local artists - cool!   I highly recommend D'Vine for a fun date night."}
{"text":"Valentines Dinner was a treat.   We had reservations for the special night at 7pm and it took awhile to get seated as earlier diners were lingering but the ambiance was lovely even though a little crowded.    I liked that they had a special 3 course Valentines Dinner for  $45 per person or you could still order off their regular dinner menu.    My filet mignon was perfect as was my husbands scallops.   Service was a bit slow with the restaurant full but everyone was hustling and still friendly.   I loved having the live jazz music and to top off the evening every woman received one long stemmed red rose.   It is nice to have a locally owned restaurant that takes care of their customers with an extra touch.   I look forward to go back to dine on the patio."}
{"text":"What a very pleasant experience.  From the time we walked in to when we left, everyone was very nice and friendly.  The food was very good, came in a timely manner and served in courses as it should be.  We will visit again soon."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of D'Vine in Chandler for some time now and I had the pleasure of attending their Wine 101 class recently.      The class was presented by David Newton, D'Vine's Sommelier.  The topics discussed during class included: serving wine, different regions and the best regions for certain grapes, and a little history of wine.  David has a great passion for wine and is an engaging speaker, so it made for a great afternoon.  The wines chosen for the class were excellent, and offered something for every palate.  This particular class was not designed specifically for tasting, although there will be a class devoted to how to taste wine in the future, this was about wine in general, which I found to be a great place to start.  There will be a different class each month through March on a variety of topics and are being held at both Mesa and Chandler locations.   This is an excellent opportunity for anyone interested in wine and meeting people with the same interest.  Can't wait for the next class!"}
{"text":"The service is exceptional and the food is delicious! All the musicians that play there are wonderful too! We love this wine bar!"}
{"text":"Nice upper scale restaurant.  Had not been to the restaurant in a couple years and went for a recent date nite with my wife but was really disappointed in the food.  Bruschetta, pizza, and other plates were average at best."}
{"text":"My initial thoughts about this place were very positive.... We bought the livingsocial coupon. My boyfriend started off with one flight of the cabernet wines and one of the Riesling. Both wines were really good in my opinion. The cheese plate was pretty standard we had the cheddar and havarti. However the more time we spent there the less I was enjoying the place.... Service was starting to get slow....  I ordered the hand made pasta dish with Cajun alfredo sauce. The pasta was completely over cooked an the sauce was bland. Not worth the $18 I paid for it. The bf got the braised beef melt (not sure if thats the name) which was raved a out in an other review. Let's just say it wasn't very big and very greasy.... Nothing impressive about this place.... While we were waiting (forever) to pay our tab we over heard some staff members yelling at each other. Probably won't come up on my radar to return..."}
{"text":"Cute little place with a cozy atmosphere.  We shared the macaroni and cheese with sausage dish and it was great! Good selection of wine.  I'd go back!"}
{"text":"We have been frequent diners at D'Vine for almost 3 years now.  Hubby and I go almost every Friday night for our \"date night\".  We are not big wine drinkers so we go for the food and friends!  The food is ALWAYS fantastic and the staff are always friendly.  Have yet to have a bad meal or bad service."}
{"text":"This place is nice with outdoor heaters and a big fire pit on their patio. The wine list is good, the beets and the Ahi tuna tapas were great!  The Brussels sprouts weren't cooked enough and weren't very flavorful. A good experience over all."}
{"text":"My first time visiting, after hearing about this place 2 years ago. Loved the crafted cocktails; I tried the cucumber martini and Valencia. Enjoyed the stuffed mushroom appetizer, although I prefer small mushrooms vs. one large. My filet was cooked just as I asked, medium rare. It was juicy and quite tasty. My husband had the chicken fried chicken, as recommended by our server. I'm not typically a fan, but couldn't stop eating my husband's meal! Delicious, and highly recommended! We finished our dining experience by sharing the red velvet cheesecake. One of the best desserts I've had! Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Last night we decided hit d vine we got there at 645pm they were already packed we were lucky enough to be seated right away. Our wait person had waited on us before and welcomed us back .........a nice touch the dinner specials we decided on looked great unfortunately were already sold out so we started to re review. The menu I decided on a different special ........oops already sold out I ended up with the pasty with beef,mash potatoes inside it was good and the wife had the scallop app. A great bottle of wine and a glass of wine comped because of being out of all the specials.......bad planning on the head chefs part"}
{"text":"Nice Place. The atmosphere is relaxing  the place is clean. The wine selection is ok not great.  The flights of reds have Prisoner as one of the selections.  It's a great wine but the flight is $26. Only had a stuffed mushroom. It was good not great. It's a bit of an over 50 crowd. Biggest flaw I saw here was from my seat in the restaurant I could see a microwave.  I have a strong dislike for any food that is microwaved."}
{"text":"Definitely an underrated spot. I came here on a night with live music and the wife and I had a great time. We had a few drinks and some great food. I will be coming back here soon!"}
{"text":"Our group of friends have been going to Dvine every Wednesday during the summer & during winter break for Happy Hour at 2 pm for the last FIVE years.  The size of our group varies depending on who is in town etc.  we have always LOVED meeting up & sitting on the couch (which is now gone) & enjoying our wine & food.  Unfortunately, the powers that be have made change after change & as far as we are concerned, not for the better.  The wait staff used to expect us & were very attentive & helpful when we selected our wine.  The food was always great.  Now the menu has changed so many times it is unrecognizable.  I don't go to a wine bar to have popcorn & pigs in a blanket.  Now that they have a hard liquor license the wine selection is not as good.  I am sorry to say that last year I would have given them 5 plus stars but after our visit last Wednesday 3 is pushing it.  The 'new' bartender was clearly lost.  Confusing wines and then appalled that we doubted he had poured the correct wines.  He mixed up who ordered what appetizers.  THEN, he had the nerve to add the  20% gratuity to each of our checks!  NEVER in the five years have they ever added the gratuity!  Our group ranges from 3 to 12 ladies & we always tip more than the 20%.  This particular bartender/server did not earn a 20% tip.  We had to constantly ask for our water glasses to be refilled which is a basic task.  We are so disappointed that last Wednesday may have been our LAST Wednesday at Dvine ever.  I truly miss the good old days when Amy, Cory & Aaron made sure we felt welcome & taken care of."}
{"text":"It was by our hotel and looked charming. From the moment we walked in, it exceeded our expectations. Had one of our favorite wines (Prisoner), food was really nice-- well prepared and proportioned well. Adam was AMAZING-- knowledgeable re menu and wines-- made great suggestions for both. Attentive but very nice pace. This would be our favorite neighborhood spot--- but we live in California!"}
{"text":"Recent return to D'Vine Bistro was consistently good! Always a comfortable, laid back atmosphere. Had a feature dish of scallops on a bed of risotto! The scallops were really good...but only three medium sized came with the dinner, could have been more for the price of the dish. On the flip side, the risotto was exceptional. Deserts are top shelf. Service always good! On our \"favorites\" list."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE. My only disappointment was when they changed their menu for summer. The regular menu is delicious. I can't wait til they change it back. But this place is really great for some live music, good wine, and good food."}
{"text":"I've written two prior reviews on Divine as we've been regulars on and off for years. We moved here full time a year ago and that's the last time I reviewed it.   MUCH has improved since then. Last year I wrote how dissapointed I was in them. But not anymore! The atmosphere is fun again, the service is consistent again and better than that... the food is really good again! They had a down swing for awhile.   These days I'm addicted to a stuffed portobello mushroom they serve that's so good its hard to describe. I'm not a vegetarian and it's a meal for me. As well, my husband orders off the daily special menu a lot and says you \"can't go wrong\".   It's not a five star dining experience, but once again, it's a really solid four stars.   And their wine list is great. they have a variety of really good and interesting wines by the glass and a fabulous by the bottle list."}
{"text":"Close to home, great food, drinks, and people....they have live music as well."}
{"text":"Ahi tuna tataki on the happy hour menu is delicious!   I would expect a better wine list from a wine bar, but I've realized I have to lower my standards for AZ compared to Chicago, IL.  Bottom line: I had a great time and ate delicious food with my tasty wine."}
{"text":"The food was good, the wine selection nice and this would have been an easy 4 star review but having my date feel rushed to leave and the numerous staff interrupting our date drops this down to the DNR category."}
{"text":"Everything cooked nicely. Salmon was on point kind of Italian style with a vodka sauce caper relish. Great IPA on tap. Service was as good as it should. Only thing I would say is get some wild salmon instead of farm raised. Delicious!"}
{"text":"They did it again another great meal. Went last night with the girlfriend, her dad in from out of town and her grandparents. We all shared the bruschetta for an app then my gf and I split the scallop salad which was perfect and a lot of food for a split plate with us each getting two scallops loads of bacon plenty of greens. The salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop, which was perfectly cooked.   for dinner all of us had the special which was a rib-eye filet. My girl friend and I split one, so did her grand parents and her dad had his own. All came out perfectly cooked as ordered, tender as can be. this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored. We subbed the green beans for the spinach which wasn't as good as normal as it was a little salty but still good. The guiness mashed potatoes were great as always. Her dad got the asparagus instead of green beans which he raved about. The split portions were plentiful and almost as big as the full portion and the lack of an up charge for splitting is great. All of us left full and when you consider it comes out to $13 per-person for a split entree of a great steak it is a smoking deal. I have to say the meat is better than some of the other places i have been recently (Don and Charlies, home cooked, Yard House)  We also had 2 bottles of wine which were good and the waiter really worked with us to understand what we were looking for and tried to recommend based on our comments on the first bottle and our previous selections (having been in several times he is beginning to recognize the gf and I) as well as keeping it at a very modest price. They even gave us a sample of the 2nd bottle for free before we ordered just to test it. The service here is top notch and they are all very personable and fun to talk to as well as attentive.  I should probably start switching up my eating a bit more but its so hard with a gem like this. Now that we found the wine club I may be here quite a bit more often.  The only thing keeping this from a 5 star review is salty spinach which may be petty but I have to keep the 5 stars for perfection"}
{"text":"East Mesa can be difficult when it comes to finding good places to eat that aren't fast food or chains in my opinion. We stumbled upon this place thanks to Yelp and it was great.   We started off with drinks at the bar and moved to a table outside. On a Friday night we waited maybe 10-15 minutes for a table. Not bad.   We ordered an appetizer, two entrees and a round of drinks and our bill was ~$60. I felt the price was good for the portion sizes (I ordered a salad and it was HUGE!!) and the quality of the food was excellent.   Things they do well: cocktails were well made. Food selection was a nice variety. Food quality was good  Things to improve on: none that I saw, but there's always something I am sure!"}
{"text":"Made a  purchase on livingsocial for this place.. $25 for $50 worth of wine tasting for two with fruit & cheese plate which is a pretty good deal. Date got the Mango stilton with ginger cheese with the cabernet flight  (3 types) & I got the Manchego cheese with the riesling flight (3 types) which had the kabinett, spatlese, auslee. Both types of cheese were very yummy & not too strong. We both loved the Mango stiltion though, it was our favorite and definitely a must try!!! As for the wine...kabinett was my favorite!! it wasn't too sweet nor too strong and it was really refreshing, the spatlese was alright & the auslee was good but a bit too sweet for my taste. The date ordered red wine only because we were gonna order the lamp pops from their appetizer menu but it turns out they were out of lamb? So we ordered the ahi tuna tostado & ceviche which we both enjoyed.   Overall the wine tasting experience here wasn't that bad and the food we ordered was pretty good. The only real problem we had with this place was that the service just sucked. I mean our waiter brought out our fruit & cheese plate and forgot our wine. And we're seated in the corner with this small itty bitty table and our waiter was never around to pick up the dishes. Then we asked for the desert menu & he went missing for like 10 mins and then comes back and says \"ohhh ill get your desert menu..\" and by that time we didn't want to order dessert anymore. Sooo with that said i would have to give this place a 3 star...I wouldn't mind going back though."}
{"text":"First off, let me say, my friend loves this place.  She always orders the Kryan pizza of which I had a bite and it was pretty good.  Also important to note up front - they only serve beer and wine - no hard liquor.  The bruschetta was passable.  I ordered a \"handmade\" pasta with \"spicy\" sausage and a red sauce which was served cold and in a sweet sauce topped with sausage that was not spicy at all.    They had some live music and a pretty nice patio.  Service was ok.  My stomach hurt all night when I got home.  Not sure if it was from dinner or from the Golden Spoon dessert.  This place is kind of pricey for the quality.  I don't think I'll be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"Nice place, good music (later), and overall enjoyed the ambience.  Unfortunately some of the review are true, the food could be improved.  Wanted to try something just to see if something like a special or app would be good, hot, and tasty.  We tried the mussels along with wine of course.  Enjoyed thew wine but the mussels were cold, they should have been hot.  They weren't that busy on a Saturday night.  They were also chewy much of the way thru. The wines by the glass are pretty good but I will say that several selections are overpriced.  Go the the valley's other million wine bars and you'll see what I'm talking about.  i will go along with some of the other review.  Go there and drink, enjoy the music, and don't expect too much from the food.  If the mussels were good we would have ordered a meal but that wasn't the case.  Left and ate elsewhere."}
{"text":"Tried to give this place another chance after not going in for over a year...  walked in, walked out.  Dirtier than ever!  Food on tables and chairs, stained carpets, filthy windows, etc.  How can we expect that the kitchen would be much cleaner.  Gross!   Never again."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! We come here every time we are in Arizona. Atmosphere is quaint and relaxing, especially love the patio and live music. Very nice wine selection, fantastic food! Staff are always on point- friendly and amazing service. LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!"}
{"text":"Went here with my wife for a quiet dinner a couple weeks ago.  It was a Saturday night, with their regular entertainer performing.  He was excellent; mix of blues, jazz, etc.  The food was just as good; their take on bruschetta is not my favorite in the valley but is very tasty.  Drinks were reasonably priced, particularly with live music.  The atmosphere was dim-lit, somewhat romantic and not noisy, particularly considering there was live music.  Will be back often from Gilbert!"}
{"text":"What the hell is this place doing in Mesa?  Ok ok, I kid. I'm a believer in giving props when they are due, and Mesa scores big with this place, no question. The food was very good, and appropriately priced (a bit pricey but proportionate to the quality). Our waitress was a charming young lady who knew the wine list inside and out and took good care of us. For starters we tried the calamari (excellent, by seafood-in-the-desert standards) and the Andouille sausage corn dogs (yummy), accompanied with a uniquely prepared dipping sauce and/or mustard for each. My entree was a calorie-laden Cajun-style mac and cheese if you can picture that. And unfortunately for my gut, I ate every last scrap of it.   The music was a bit strange, but it somehow fit the occasion. I love the Beatles and heard \"Michelle\" at one point, but it sounded like some weird remake. Except, it still sounded like Paul McCartney's voice. My friends and I were confounded. Which is all very symbolic. Listening to Paul McCartney's voice to an unfamiliar music set is as surreal as enjoying a great dinner and a wine flight in a hip venue in... Mesa."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time tonight with my husband. We enjoyed our dinner and the atmosphere was good. Our waitress was very attentive and responsive. We both ordered the fish and chips and a side salad and both thought everything tasted very good. There was so much food we could've ordered one entree and split it. My husband's only complaints had to do with his drinks. He originally ordered a glass of red wine before deciding on dinner and he thought it tasted like it had been opened too long. So he then ordered beer but they didn't have either of his favorites, Sam Adams or Fat Tire, My wine tasted fne, but I'm no wine connoisseur so you can't really go by me. We came early and left early so we didn't hear much of the live music but what we heard was good and not too loud. It's not a place we'll go often just because of the cost, but I think we'll probably come back here and try some other entrees."}
{"text":"I had the chance to get out to this place last week for some great Blues music,  and found the food to be excellent.  What a nice surprise.  Started with the pizza appetizer, prociutto , sun dried tomatoes, greens, YUMMY.  I had the Salmon Risotto and my date had the Stroganoff  with  short  ribs.  He loved it.  We ate it all and went for the chocolate mouse' dessert, which was not as impressive as the food.  Perhaps they didn't make it on site.  I highly recommend this place  Very charming interior, but dark.  Had to read menu with my purse flashlight, but so worth it.  I'd go again. Also their wine list was extensive, I'm not a wine person but they had many choices.   The sign was off that night and it was a little hard to find because it was so dark."}
{"text":"Gross!  They don't clean the wine bottles that they bring to the table that are filled with water!  Ours had food and sticky stuff on the outside, who knows what's inside.  The food was mediocre and overpriced.  Happy hour menu was awful.  Previously frozen cheap food.  I don't go to applebees or fridays for a reason...blah.  Cocktails were nothing special.  Our server was awful!  She was too busy talking with the rest of her coworkers to take care of us.  We waited forever to order and sat with empty glasses.  Food was boring and I could've made it better at home.  Will not be back.  Do yourself a favor and save your money."}
{"text":"Love this place. Ruben and the rest of the staff rock. The work the butts off. Great happy hour and great food. They enlarged the patio so it will be nice to sit out there once it cools off."}
{"text":"When Mom picked me up from the airport around 8 the pickins were a little slim. However, Mom knew of this good little wine bar that she thought I might like. Might like? Me? Wine? Bar? Needless to say, I LOVED it! And I was surprised that my mom had found such a cool place - sorry Mom :x.   Their selection of wines was good and their food selections ... we couldn't decide! We did tapas - beer battered calamari (it was okay ... some were a little chewy), fondue (OMG!! Let's just say that if I were to find a Cheese and Wine Bar I might start crying), and their tapas special - crab filled portabelo (really, really good!!).   Unfortunately, I don't remember what wine I chose but it was good - apparently not memorable.   I liked the live jazzy music but would have enjoyed my time here a little more if it wasn't so loud - and we were in the back. But the guy singing was good and that's what they do - jazz and wine - so I can't really complain.   I'll be dragging mom back here next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Wasn't expecting  such delicious  food!  Ordered the veggie  and  chicken  pasta in basil  sauce with rigatoni.  So superb.  Purple  and yellow  cauliflower was a pleasant  surprise.  Would certainly  recommend  this place,  and I'm a picky  foodie!"}
{"text":"D'Vine is a nice neighborhood spot that has an intimate setting, extensive menu for a wine bar, and live music several nights a week.  They have far more than wine and the menu was rather impressive.  I had a bruschetta sampler and recommend this as there are six varieties to choose from and you get two pieces each of any three.  The house Moroccan meatballs looked fantastic and service was pretty good too.  There is some outdoor seating that looked like a good lounging spot barring heat."}
{"text":"I love this place. Simple as that.  Great wine, great people, great atmosphere, great art, great food, great music, great memories.  What more can I say."}
{"text":"Our favorite neighborhood wine bar!  The bartenders are awesome!  Very comfortable and relaxing atmosphere.  Great wine selection by the glass and bottle and good tapas.  They have a nice patio to sit outside when the weather permits.  We also enjoy the free wine tastings on Wednesday nights.  Great way to learn more about wine and explore new options."}
{"text":"Nice little place with great music and ambiance. Kitchen was already closed so we didn't have a chance to try out the food which may never happen now. Our server was just plain horrible. You could tell she didn't want to be there and was just going through the motions. Most of her time was spent sitting at the bar or conversating with some obvious regulars. When she did make an appearance she was rude and short. The place is really close to home and would've been a nice place to stop by after a long day but if I want rude obnoxious service I'll go to the dive bar down the street that charges half the price."}
{"text":"I've been here with my family 4 times and been underwhelmed every time. Most recently I was here for dinner and ordered the evening special filet mignon with a wine demi glace. The steak was cooked just as I ordered but the demi glace tasted like cheap bbq sauce - just yuk. The vegetables that came with my meal were terribly overcooked and not good. We also ordered an appetizer or stuffed mushrooms and it was also overcooked and really not very good. The amount of cheese that topped the mushrooms was overwhelming such that you couldn't even taste the mushroom. In the past I've ordered salad or bruschetta and they were fine but also not great. The bruschetta bread was so hard that it hurt the roof of my mouth. Stick to salad and drinks here."}
{"text":"We really enjoy this restaurant.  They have an original menu and GREAT wine selection.  It's not inexpensive, by any means, but has yet to disappoint."}
{"text":"Music too loud to have a normal conversation. Food poor in quality. Bartender not interested in being a good host. Just pass this place by."}
{"text":"Amazing ambiance for an evening with friends, excellent food and great happy hour prices. Did I remind you to try the sliders?? Yum!!"}
{"text":"NIce atmosphere with lots of reasonably priced wine.  I asked if there was a corkage and my hostess said no but there is a $10 discount if you take it home.  So yes - there is a corkage.  Had the boar chops which the server insisted should be medium or they would be bloody.  Ordered medium rate - at least the cooks know what they are doing.  The chops were cooked nicely.  Unfortunately they were covered with a crappy bbq sauce that almost single handily destroyed the meal.  Fortunately for the crappy bbq sauce there were super salty veggies.  So much salt that they took the honor of destroying the dish.   Too bad - chops were good."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Great food service and entertainment. If you have Kendra take care of you so much the better. Leave her a nice tip as she works hard to make sure you are happy."}
{"text":"Northeast Mesa isn't known as the hippest spot in the Valley, but the addition of D'Vine certainly takes it up the \"cool\" scale a notch. Critics are calling it the \"most inspired\" dining option in Mesa. This humble critic would have to agree.  D'Vine features minimalist decor and an all-black clad wait staff. The atmosphere is chic yet at the same time casual and warm. The mission of the owners is to make fine wines \"accessible\" and consequently D'Vine is no \"wine snobs\" zone.  Where else in Mesa can you enjoy $5 wine tasting and live acoustic music? The tasting is on Tuesdays and features different \"hosts\" or wine representatives each week. Sometimes they are the actual winemaker, which is really cool.  But it's the food that getting all the raves.  Lunch choices are decidedly above typical deli fare: grilled swordfish with reduction and lean hamburger stuffed with Gouda cheese. For appetizers try the tempura prawns, stuffed escargot or one of eight kids of bruschetta. Yes-- in MESA!  For dinner, D'Vines serves such unique dishes such as grilled Buffalo, Ostrich, and Wild Boar. They do of course serve tamer fare such as Seared Wild Salmon or Kobe Meatloaf.   So cool, you just might forget you're in Mesa."}
{"text":"This is our \"Go To\" spot in Chandler, we love it here. We usually sit at the bar and order wine and some appetizers to share. The bartender, Ruben, always recognizes us and greets us warmly. His service is impeccable! The menu is quite varied and they change it up very often, but we have never be disappointed in our selection. The wine list is quite extensive and the live music is enjoyable without being intrusive."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner here. Nice bottle of Left Coast Pinot Gris, accompanying a super tasty and well prepared seared diver scallop special entree as well as my wife's good-as-usual southwestern salmon cake salad. Called about 25 minutes ahead of time to make a reservation and arrived to find a note on the front desk about our call and a hostess and table waiting for us in a crowded room. Table service was only decent. Our waiter had a forced pseudo-knowledgeableness about him and didn't show up at the table except to take the order, deliver the wine (which he forgot about and had to ask us a second time what we'd ordered), and bring the check (which we didn't request). Fifth star withheld due to spotty service."}
{"text":"I love love love this little wine bar.  It is tucked away in Chandler and it is more than just wine.    I went there for New Year's Eve and the menu was great.  Total side note...whoever compiled the music list for that night did a great job.  You never get to hear old school R&B and we were singing the whole night.    There were so many different things to try and taste on the menu.   The wine is top notch and they go out of their way to help you pick something you'd like if you are not sure."}
{"text":"Me and my wife like to stop here for their happy hour specials. Have not had the dinner here, just lunch and happy hour, so I can't comment on those dishes. Happy Hour prices are reasonable and they have a nice selection of wine and local craft beer. The bruschetta is great and so are the mussels"}
{"text":"I love this place.  The patio is my favorite.  I recommend the appetizers.  They are all very amazing.  The hummus is my personal fave.  Get the Creme Brulee for dessert..  Wine tastings are fun here, too."}
{"text":"This was the location for a Bridal Shower I attended. The service was great! Our waiter even split the check...what? 25 different ways - that was awesome! The space they put us in was cozy and well lit. My food tasted great! I had their Brie, Marinated Artichoke, and Smoked Salmon (yes, I actually ordered fish!) Bruschetta; each had it's own flavor and textures and I liked them all, although I liked the Brie best.  It was an interesting venue for a Bridal Shower, at times I think our group was a little too loud for the surrounding tables, and when the bride-to-be started opening her gifts...well, it's a family restaurant so I think everyone was a little embarrassed bystanders and invitees/gift-givers alike.  Next time I come I will order an entire meal, this place was great."}
{"text":"Really good lunch specials.  Bruschetta was really good.  Awesome that you get to pick 3 different types to try.  Its a wine bar, and I'm not a wine guy, but the wife loved it.  Split the bruschetta and a chicken wrap with fries.  Fries were seasoned perfectly.  Some of the best fries ever. Good portions sizes, and good value.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Everything worked out very well had a mushroom appetizer it's actually only one mushroom but it was fine little salad on the side some bread couple glasses of wine James the manager came over said hello they have sports on the box comfortable environment have no problem with that at all I'll be back"}
{"text":"Amazing French fries! Is that weird for me to say? We tried the brushetta with apple and Brie, smoked salmon, and the caprese.  My favorite of the 3? Tough choice, I'd say it's a tie between the salmon and the caprese. It seems like everything I kind of liked, something on it I didn't care for. The caprese was the only one I didn't pick anything off of.  I severely wanted to try the peach cobbler but next time I will try it. I personally do not like the blueberry beer but my boyfriend liked it surprisingly. My friend works here so I will be back more so for her not so much the food. Our waiter was beyond on point I wish I would have got his name for this review but I will edit this when I get it. :)"}
{"text":"I have not been here for a while. I must say I was very impressed. We came for happy hour and the food was delicious. I was also impressed with the portion sizes.  We tried the butternut squash risotto, pork wings, avocado salad, pepper shrimp, pork empanadas, and devil eggs (yes all of this)!!! Everything was perfectly seasoned and tasted fresh.  Added bonus ... large patio with heaters and live music.  We will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Very Surprised!  We recently moved to the area from Scottsdale where we were used to amazing restaurants with nice atmosphere and top notch food. We see this wine bar every day when we drive by. Some friends recommend it so we decided to try it. We were pleasantly surprised with the nice cozy atmosphere and friendly staff. We ordered some happy hour wines which were very good and reasonably priced at $5 each. We also had the fish tacos and street tacos which were very good and had amazing flavors. Jason took good care of us and was very helpful with all our wine questions. The second time we went, same thing, and Jason remembered us! We noticed the second time they were hosting a NYE 5 course dinner for $65 per person so we booked a table for us and some friends as it seemed reasonable and nearby.  We returned for NYE and the place was packed but we were seated on time. Even though it was very busy, the staff was spot on with everything. As usual we were tended to in a timely manner and even the busser \"Jackie\" would bring clean silverware if we left ours on one of the five course plates without us asking. I was a little hesitant to see such amazing food on the menu for the price, wondering if it would live up to it.   OMG I had the crab stuffed mushrooms (flavorful, large, with amazing coleslaw presentation), tomato bisque soup (perfect spicy kick with roasted tomato flavors), walnut romaine salad (grilled stock with grilled onions and some sort of amazing drizzled dressing), Chilean sea bass (Ok, I only eat fresh Hong Kong steamed sea bass and knew this wouldn't be up to par, but it was really well prepared with spices and sauce which didn't overpower the fish and it was cooked perfectly) and apple crisp for dessert (perfect combo of baked granola and baked apples ala mode, and it wasn't too sweet or sugary which was PERFECT! So many chefs make dissert too sweet) with some yummy champagne. My other guests had nothing but good to say about their dinners as well (NY steak and lamb shank) and they gave the black eyed pea soup thumbs up!  This is definitely our new fav that we will be dropping in to from now on. Give it a try if you like a posh but laid-back atmosphere with good food and good prices!"}
{"text":"Love this cute little wine bar that also serves beer and vodka (since I'm not a big wine drinker) . Food is really good! Ruben holds it down at the bar and is always so friendly! Good happy hour! Really love this place!  ."}
{"text":"Wow! I used to live in Las Sendas and have been to the Mesa location several times and it has always been mediocre to just ok. Having moved to Chandler recently and seeing online that Dvine Chandler is starting a lot of specials this summer, I decided to check it out.  What brought me in was their summer backyard BBQ menu that they are doing on Sundays. We arrived at 12:30 and we were the only ones there (except for one older guy sitting at the bar).  We were seated right away and waters were brought out quickly. I was very impressed with the service. Our waitress was very warm, friendly and attentive. I was also impressed by the fact that when she forgot what I ordered (ok servers, just write it down and stop trying to impress us because it's super irritating when you forget or get something incorrect), she came back right away to confirm instead of guessing and screwing up. Good move, but just write it down at the beginning.  We had a party of 8 and I have to say I felt that we were really taken care of. Granted, there was no one else in the restaurant. I'll have to see what the service is like on a busy night. Our server brought my mom a sample of vodka to taste because she was ordering a new martini. I thought that was very thoughtful.  Our food was delicious. Everything was plated beautifully and the portion sizes were generous. The only exception was the calamari. It was tough and rubbery and the sauce was too sweet and greasy. Don't get that one. But seriously everything else was excellent. My husband said the pork relleno was the best thing he has ever eaten (and we have eaten at a lot of fine restaurants).  I liked the atmosphere too. It's much bigger than the Mesa location. I think it was about 2pm when the live music started, which was very nice.  Not a good spot for kids (which I guess goes without saying). I did bring my 3 and 5 year old since it was lunch time but there really aren't any menu options for them.  I had a great experience here, a couple hiccups, but the food to the service to the atmosphere was pretty good overall. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"What a little gold mine of a place.  The food was fantastic and the atmosphere was so relaxing.  The patio seating was comfortable and our server actually knew the meaning of silent service which is a rare find.  Next time we will go a little later in the evening so that we can enjoy the live music as well."}
{"text":"Decent food but rushed service. Even at  about $25pp, the wait staff was unwilling to talk long enough to explain menu options!"}
{"text":"Food is good, but way over priced for the portion size. This is Mesa, not Scottsdale. We like our food to come in American sizes."}
{"text":"Excellent beer selection.  Wine priced higher than it should be but $5 happy hour sangria was outstanding  ($8 if not happy hour).  Calamari strips were thick, unlike any I have had before.  They called them calamari steaks.   Served with nicely cooked veggies.  My fish and chips was swai (catfish) and my wife's beef salad was to die for.   It's an easy walk to the Holiday Inn next door, which is where I will stay again when I return.  Check this place out."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this spot after seeing it fairly well rated on Zagat. The service was nice and the ambience was pleasant, especially on the patio on a September night, though I found the food subpar. 1) The only Malbec was ok 2) The cheese plate was poorly plattered in that it was hard to access the wedges of cheese between all of the ramekins and the crostini didn't quite suit the cheeses that it was paired with. In addition to that, everything seemed to come out of a jar and the cheese was not high quality. 3) Similarly, the burger that I got was ok but quite fatty 4) The parmesan on my parmesan fries was not fresh which, had I known, would have resulted in me getting something different. While I dearly hoped to enjoy it, the food was not quality and that soured my experience. While I won't be back, I thank you for the enjoyable service and I implore you to invest in better cheeses, explore your creativity, and pay more attention to detail as it relates to the food."}
{"text":"Been here twice and enjoyed it.  A bit to pricey but the quality and uniqueness of the food is great.  Good place to take a date, casual and comfy."}
{"text":"We love to come here on date night away from the kids. The flights are always interesting and I haven't disliked any of the food we have ever ordered. They are also really great about altering dishes for me since I have food allergies. The only thing I would wish would be a little more expansive dessert menu."}
{"text":"Good food and a nice outside dining area I you catch it on the right night."}
{"text":"Excellent meal and a very nice wine selection.  Our service was quite good as well. We went on a Monday night and the place was packed. I'd definitely would go again"}
{"text":"Never go on Wednesday , wine sample night. Otherwise I really like the flexibility of the menu and the wine selection."}
{"text":"The main reason I am giving 3 stars tonight was the service! Not all together but our waitress as a whole was awful! She never came to our table during our dinner. We had to flag her down for a box and asked for the check right away. Then we waited forever for her to come back and run our card!! Ridiculous!! I ordered the pizza, it was my first experience. I had the margharita pizza. They girl both sides of the crust were grilled, very thin, not crunchy, very floppy. I believe they used a vodka cream sauce, not too tasty, very runny. The cheese was just so-so. The tomatoes weren't holding together well and there wasn't enough basil for my taste. It wasn't sliced well either but it didn't taste bad not together. Just not known for their pizza."}
{"text":"I went there for a meeting with my Smart Set sisters and it was delightful! I had the grilled salmon over kale and mash potatoes and it was awesome! However, the piece of salmon was a bit small. I know it was lunch, but the cut of salmon was skimpy--good but skimpy. Everyone else had the salmon cake salad and they rave it! The ambiance was nice and the service was very good! I would given it 4 stars but I can't let go of how small my piece of salmon was!"}
{"text":"This was our second visit. Everything we've had here has been nothing short of amazing!  Tonight I had the salmon over a butternut squash that was rich and brimming with flavor.  My wife had the salmon cake salad that was light, delicious with a bit of kick.  The french fries are perhaps best I've ever had. And the wine selection is huge. had a bottle of Evolution, a blend from Oregon that was crisp, fruity and smooth.  Definitely recommend the wine flights ; last visit had a fantastic red flight.  Honestly best restaurant we've found in 7 years of living in Chandler."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very romantic and very good food. The flavors were all right on, drinks were excellent and I would love to go back here again.  I took my mom and she even loved it so that is something ,she's picky! What can I say the women in my family love bistro's. Oh and my kids loved all the food too!"}
{"text":"Pitifully under achieved bruschetta ( plz excuse the spelling) This was a culinary Hindenberg.   Ordered one with squash and candied walnuts and one with squash and goat cheese perhaps. It was hard bread with cold canned toppings. The attached picture tells a tale . 9 dollars mis-spent."}
{"text":"Let me pre-empt this by saying the ONLY reason Im giving 1 stars is because the waiter was honest with me. If there were a way to give zero, I would.  Now on to the cockroaches. Yes, I said cockroaches.  Ive been here once before, and rather enjoyed it. I try to experience a place at least twice or more though before I write a review because sometimes things arent always as they seem on first impressions. So it seems was this place. The first time I went here, everything was outstanding. It would have been at least a 4 if not 5. But this time, my wife and I sat down and ordered 2 glasses of Malbec and 2 appetizers, still trying to decide on main courses. The wine and appetizers came, and we ordered our main course. As we are eating our first appetizer I notice a bug coming from the kitchen out into the main dining area. Curious, I stood up to investigate, and yep, its a cockroach. I wave my waiter over to show him, and he kills it and I go sit back down. He comes to our table and apologizes and says he knows about them and that they have a cockroach problem. WHAT???? He says the place is under new ownership and that there are several problems that the wait staff are trying to fix on their own. DOUBLE WHAT??? What other problems are there that I dont know about??? Omg. Check please. So he cancels our order, delivers me a bill and tells me that he didnt charge us for the main dishes, but has to charge us for the one appetizer we already ate. OMG!!! Welcome to the age of the internet Divine Wine. I hope everyone reading this stays the heck away, and now I need to go call the health department.  Update: Maricopa Health Dept notified. Complaint number 1105179."}
{"text":"I got to eat at this place for the first time for Valentines day.  A complete surprise and it was great!  First off, when you walked into the door they handed every female a rose.   Due to it being a \"special event\" they had a limited meal selection (that sounded super delicious) that you got to select one appetizer, one salad, a main course and a desert per person for one price (which was around $60 a person for special occasion).  I selected the sausage appetizer, greek salad, steak meal and cheese cake.  Literally EVERYTHING was delicious!  I would definitely recommend for the future.  The wine choices were grand as well.  They had so many selections, I was very happy.   I was told by many people that the pricing for normally eating there is not as expensive but it was worth it to me."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite happy hour spots in Chandler- and trust me, I've tried a lot of places since moving here a year ago. They feature $5 small plates during happy hour and they are GOOD! They also have a great cheese plate. Prices are reasonable, portions are good, and service is excellent.  Happy hour lasts until 6:00pm and is Mon through Sat."}
{"text":"I have been to D'Vine on many occasions, and have nothing but good things to say.  I have tried lunch and dinner on different days, and the service has always been consistent and impeccable.  The food each time has always been impeccable as well.  I love that this is a local eatery in the neighborhood, and has great ambiance and great food and of course wine.  Everything I've ever tried here is delicious.  My favorites are the edamame (always add the chili sauce), cheese/nut plate, pizzas, steak dishes, salmon and steak salad or salad with scallops.  The wine selection is fantastic, and I usually try something different each time I go.  We even had my 40th birthday party here, and the server there was awesome and treated me like a queen, even though you could tell it was a very busy night for him.  I haven't been for happy hour, but here the specials are great during that time. We also love the live music on the weekends.  Great place to keep your dollars in Arizona instead of going to national chain restaurant. My profile picture is a picture of me and my husband at my 40th birthday party at D-vine.  :)"}
{"text":"I have only lived here a few months and have come 4 times.  Took out of state guests and everyone loved their food. The super food salad is amazing.  Bruschetta was yummy.  Everyone was happy with their food.  We also loved the West End Stout...icy cold and tasty. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Service was great. The food quality and quantity is really poor. We ordered cheese and grapes platter and guess what....2 slices of cheese?? R u kidding me. Grapes were sort of saggy too. We also ordered tuna Mahi salad or something and it was OK to mediocre."}
{"text":"This place was definitely a nice surprise. It's location is near the grocery store my friends and I always stopped at before heading to the salt river...so I was surprised that such a classy joint was located across the street.  The vibe was very nice and the atmosphere was that of pure sophistication, though I can't praise the establishment fully. Though the selection of wine was impressive, and the live music was delightful, there were almost no options for a vegetarian. There wasn't a single entree that could be made meat free and still be substantial. I ended up getting bruschetta. It was decent, though nothing memorable...and not very filling.   So vegetarians, beware! This place was not meant for us, sadly :("}
{"text":"1/14/10 Met Violeta H. and new Yelper friend Aly (D.?) here today for happy hour (HH).  As soon as I walked into the resto, I noticed that the noise level was high, even though there were only 6 or less patrons (including me), plus 3 or 4 employees present.  Ambience was OK- portraits of past actors and actresses (era of Grant, Monroe, and Gardner) and black or dark furniture, etc. Since Violeta had arrived earlier, she already had a glass of wine in front of her.  After a few minutes, our server came and asked if I would like to order a drink- I asked if I could sample a couple of red wines.  I had sensed that he might not have liked this request, but he said sure.  After I'd made my decision and let him know which, he dropped off the selection shortly, but took awhile to bring me a glass of water despite my asking for one earlier.  Again, it wasn't busy at all as it was only around 430p.   Aly D. arrived, and after chatting it up a bit, and waiting for our server to come back (maybe 10 to 15 minutes of lag time), I placed my order of bruschetta of brie, marinated artichoke, and smoked salmon (brie, apple and slivered almonds; artichokes, roasted red pepper pesto and goat cheese; salmon, mascarpone, olives, and capers) and Violeta asked for sweet potato fries.  We continued to chat and sip our wines (Aly D. only drank wine; she didn't have anything to eat), and after about 10 or 15 more minutes, the bruschetta arrived.  After taking a few photos of the dish and offering the two women some of the pieces (Aly refused and V. opted to wait for her fries, which hadn't arrived yet), I chose to start w/ one of the roasted red pepper pieces, and after attempting to knife into a corner, and not succeeding, I picked it up and took a bite.  The bread they chose to serve me was stale!  I spat that out, and, wanting to ask V. or Aly to confirm that the bread was indeed stale, I tried to slice off a piece of bread, and pieces flew across the table.  Finally, I was able to hand a sample to V., who agreed that the bread was stale.  After a few attempts to flag our server down, at last he came back to ask how I was enjoying the app (Violeta's fries still hadn't arrived).  When I told him that the bread was stale, he vehemently denied that the bread could be stale, as their bread is made in-house.  He then just left it at that, panning over the three of us, and after a few uneasy seconds, he asked if I'd like to order something else.  I was taken aback by his reaction to my observation and decided that I didn't want to order anything else, so I just told him to take the app back.  Before he left, Violeta kindly reminded him that she still didn't have her sweet potato fries, so he went back to the kitchen to check on that.  I don't know what the other two were thinking, but I was still reeling from our server's remark and how he had handled the exchange.  A woman came by to drop off the fries, which were tasty and very crispy, just the way I liked it (thanks V. for sharing!), and soon after, our original server arrived back to say that the chef had sampled the returned bruschetta, had agreed that the bread was not up to standards and would like to know if I would like to have another prepared.  I said yes, I'd love to try again.  Finally, a solution was offered!  But why did it take all those many minutes?  The second plate arrived, the obligatory picture-taking done, and I took a bite of the salmon, and all was well again in the universe!  This time the bread was NOT stale, and while I liked all of the selections, I wouldn't order this dish again.   We continued to chat and enjoy our wines, but I still wanted to try something else, so I asked for the Cuban sandwich, which arrived after a few minutes.  (Strange, but I couldn't find a photo of it,nor the fries, in my collection, so perhaps V. or Aly took pics for me?  Please send them over!)  This tasty halved sandwich was quite petite- about three bites, four at the most, and one half had the two kinds of meat- ham and smoked pork (?) and some sort of cheese and the other half only cheese.  My lack of concentration w/ my selection is testimony that I did not enjoy my experience here at D'Vine...   Because of 1.) the many failed attempts to flag our server down, 2.) the long waiting times in between server visits, 3) the lag time of the sweet potato fries, 4.) our server's reaction to the stale bread, 5.) the miniscule sandwich which only had meat in one-half of it, and 6.) the resto's noise when it wasn't even busy (the noise grew as the afternoon turned into night), I will never go back again, not even to try their lunch menu, which is a pity as the eight selections featured, each at $7.49, look promising.  In retrospect, I wished that we had  stood up after the initial reaction to the stale bread and gone with V.'s suggestion to go to Cork and finish happy hour there.  Sorry, but I do not agree that life is divine at D'Vine!"}
{"text":"For starters, this restaurant was right next door to one of my favorites: Caffe Boa. This was my birthday dinner from Chad so I decided to NOT ask to go to the neighbors establishment instead of his choice. I AM SO GLAD I DIDN'T! D'Vine was exactly that devine!  We started off with a small rundown of the specials and favorites of our waitress. She was extremely helpful in explaining her favorites. I find it helpful to ask the people who work there what is good, as they usually are spot on.  I stared off with a wine trio flight. The Rose' I found them refreshing and satisfying. I also sipped on water with cucumber, who knew it would be so refreshing (and also great to cleanse the palette). We then decided to try several appetizers or tapas. 3 different types of bruschetta: traditional (tomato, garlic, and basil), caprese (tomato, mozzarella, and basil) and brie (brie cheese, apple slices and sliced almonds) each wonderful in their own rite. Our second appetizer was the cesar salad in which we substituted the chicken with salmon.. EXCELLENT! I was pleasantly surprised at how much the taste delighted me. Our third was the stuffed mushroom. I thought it was going to be something like fried mushrooms, but it was a portabello mushroom that had Gruyère cheese, Parmesan sprinkles, red onions and was sauteed in butter and shallots. Wonderful! Fourth and last was the fruit and cheese plate. your choice of any two or four: bleu, brie, white cheddar, gruyere, gouda havarti, robusto, or featured cheese of the day served with spiced nuts, fruit, mixed olives and crostini. Sigh.. Main course consisted of the handmade pasta (cajun alfredo) with spicy Italian sausage (Chads) and the mac and cheese. This was no ordinary mac and cheese. It was made with smoked gouda, heavy cream, smoked pork, and penne pasta. Covered in a blanket of toasted breadcrumbs, shredded cheese red onions and bacon. OMG.  Last but not least dessert. I had the granny apple pie with caramel sauce and paired with a tawny port (cannot remember the name sorry!) Chad had the chocolate mousse cake with raspberry sauce. A M A Z I N G! I mean it... this place was awesome. Live music (think John Mayer) awesome atmosphere. Knowledgeable and friendly staff. This place was excellent.  Prices were not too bad if you didnt have all the appetizers and wine I had haha.... I will return, you can count on that and I will be hungry when I go!"}
{"text":"This is a great spot for a date or dinner with friends.  The menu features tapas, bruschetta and pizzas - all great for sharing.  They also offer a variety of wine flights in case you can't choose just one!  I've only been to this location on the weekend, and they always have live music."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food. Great service. Great drinks and overall very quaint. Definitely one of my favs in Mesa."}
{"text":"Had a great couple glasses of wine and dinner at d-vine. Great food, great wine, great ambiance. Need to come here more often."}
{"text":"This was our first time at this wine bar. We were celebrating my moms birthday with a girls night out. The server was great at helping us pick a wine for the table as well as with the food. We are all pretty picky about food, we like simple, and they had some simple with a twist of, \"what in the world is that'. I'm sure most people know but like I said, we like simple :) I did not care for my meal so I was eating off my sisters plate, our server noticed and apologized right away and asked if I wanted something else. I explained that it was no big deal, its my taste buds and that I was fine. She insisted that I at least get a dessert, and hey who can pass up dessert. The cheesecake was AMAZING!! The bartender was also really great. He found out it was my moms birthday and insisted we have shots on him. We bought a few bottles of wine and in my opinion tipped well. We were very satisfied with our experience and will defiantly return!"}
{"text":"I love D-Vine! It's a pleasant place to sit on the patio with friends enjoying a glass of wine and a variety of appetizers. The servers are very knowledgeable of the wines and will gladly give you suggestions. The full dinners are superb, but we usually find the appetizers are more than enough."}
{"text":"We went out for my moms b-day on Cinco De Mayo and really didn't want to deal with crowds. So we chose a wine place hoping all the Cinco De Mayo party goers were somewhere else! We picked correct, because when we arrived for lunch no one was in the restaurant. It was nice to have the place to ourselves for about an hour. Our waitress was very lovely and helpful. She was able to find a wine the whole table liked and gave each of us different options off the menu. I ordered the hand made pasta with chicken and basil pesto! It was absolutely delicious!!!! Once she set my plate down I dove right in! It was full of flavor, the chicken was nice and juicy and the pasta was cooked perfectly! My sister has more bland taste buds and ordered the artichoke dip. She was thinking along the lines of a regular plain artichoke dip and what she got was a surprise. The artichoke dip included chorizo, goat cheese and corn relish, definitely something my sister wasn't expecting. I thought it was awesome! They have their own little recipe to give plain artichoke dip a bigger bang! My mom enjoyed every bit of her brushetta and my sister spiced up her mac n chesses with the waiters recommendations! 3 out of 4 happy in our family never really happens, so my hats off to you D'Vine! Since my one sisters taste buds are so bland the waiter insisted she have dessert on the house. I thought that was very nice of her, for it wasn't the cooks fault that she didn't enjoy her meal. Not a lot of places are like that, so it was a nice treat for the table. A big thank you for that!  We spent quite some time here eating, drinking and visiting. The staff was so friendly and kind the whole time we were there, which is always enjoyable and the food was absolutely delicious! It was a great start to celebrating my moms birthday!"}
{"text":"So I'm out visiting the cute little nephew in Mesa and his adorable parents (one of which is my really fun brother) and like any good Yelper, I check out the possible places to eat, drink and be merry while I'm there.  I say to my brother, \"Hey, I really want to try this place called D'Vine\".  He gives me this blank stare, and then says, \"How do you know that place? It's GREAT!\"  I tell him, his wife, and the people at D'Vine all about Yelp, since no one I met in Arizona had ever heard of it.  Anyway, there are some new converts now.  Turns out my brother and his wife have eaten there many times each week since it's close to their house.    As for D'Vine - it really was FABULOUS.  No, seriously.  The appetizers were excellent, well-priced, and executed beautifully.  My brother chose the wine, but the list was pretty far-ranging.  Eating here was like eating at some of my favorite places when I go to Italy - just excellent food.  They had pheasant (my brother), hanger steak (my hubby) and a hamburger that was out of this world (me and my dad).  While the live music was nice, the live singing was not enjoyable and way too loud to have a conversation.  I will definitely be back again and again to this place, when it's much warmer and I can be outside on the patio (away from the singing).   They have a great patio and a fire pit, which was really welcome on the cold night after Christmas.  While initially we seemed to get passed over for service, the gal who came to serve us more than made up for any gaffes by her friendliness, excellent service and overall knowledge of the food.  I will definitely be coming back the next time I'm in Mesa."}
{"text":"I've had lunch here a number of times and never been disappointed.  D'Vine has a nice decor - comfortable and spacious.  I've always had really friendly service and the food is always good.  Nice portion sizes too.  The thing I love about this place is that it's never crowded at lunch.  I don't know why that is, but it works to my benefit and I'm not complaining."}
{"text":"Wow bad meal unusual for this place   Calamari was good but everything's elsewhere bad.  Hair in my plate.  Fishy's salmon marks sausage on pizza really fatty.  Portobellos vinegary"}
{"text":"Ok Ok Ok...I said in my last review that I would never go back.  I lied.    Met some friends there that actually frequent the place.  They knew the servers, which made the experience a little bit better.  While waiting for my friend's husband to show up, we shared the calamari.  Yes folks, this was not fresh calamari...but you know what? Who cares!  First off, I am in AZ...second, wherever it came from....it was was good!  We were going to order the spinach and artichoke dip, but our server informed us that ladies get $$$ off the brushetta.  I wasn't thrilled with the Traditional Brushetta....felt like it was was missing something.  The Caprese was excellent, but the Artichoke was by far the best.  I could have ordered more if I had to.    The wine list is extensive, and I promise the next time I go I will get some.  (I saw the prices, and they weren't that bad) The wine pairings is something that I would also love to try out.....5 courses for $65 is not a bad deal at all.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very local to us, and has been around for awhile. We tried it on a spur of the moment, did not have a reservation on a Saturday night but was late enough to get the last table. Our table was in the back of the restaurant which was perfect to hear the live music and still have a conversation. Tammy was our server.  We ordered cocktails while perusing the menu. We had the Calamari (lightly breaded, fried, tossed with a thai sweet chili sauce and cilantro), Margarita Pizza (marinara, sliced roma tomatoes, julienne basil, fresh mozzarella, house cheese blend) and the Short Rib (beer braised beef, yam mash, broccolini with a root beer reduction).  The food tasted good, Calamari a little too saucy, Pizza was good, Short Ribs were good (a bit pricey for the size of dish). Service was good. Love the live music, I would try again but try different dishes next time around."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch during the week.  It's close to work and figured why not.    Took a seat at the bar and the bar tender was lovely, friendly, and helpful. Nothing to complain about here.  And while I wish I could have enjoyed some Fermented Grape Juice or other Cocktail. Unfortunately, having to go back to work got in the way ;).    Ordered the Chicken Penne Pasta.  And first off$14 lunch portion. My first thought was, \"wait I ordered the lunch portion and not an entire chicken right?\"   But such was life and just went on to enjoy the meal to come.    Order comes and I guess for the price and the way D'Vine presents itself from the moment you walk in I expected some plating/presentation that would align with the rest of the establishment.    The dish was generic at best. Just some sliced chicken breast with pesto sauce and penne. Chicken was over cooked and a bit tough. Everything else was ok. It didn't leave a lasting impression and you could have easily put a pesto penne from a thousand other corporate Italian restaurants in front of me and I'm sure they'd all be the same.   I don't mind the above average prices, but to charge those for a \"lunch\" menu I would hope you would pride yourself in putting out above average food.   I'll come back for the the ambiance and that fermented Grape Juice, but no eating for me."}
{"text":"I visited D'vine for dinner during the week. The location is convenient off the 202 and it does offer a nice atmosphere with patio and occasional live music. Beyond those qualities is where the experience was lacking.  The prices are a little high for the food quality which must be priced for the affluent Las Sendas neighborhood nearby. I ordered the pasty and my wife ordered the bistro chicken. The pasty was disappointing and was like pot roast in an empanada, Cornish Pasty is much better and half the cost. My wife's chicken was bland all around. The service was a little slow as well rounding off a fair 3 star rating. Not sure if ill go back."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and pretty surprised they don't have better reviews. There are not many places like this in the area and I really enjoy the atmosphere, service and food! I love that they have yummy appetizers and small plate options! They also offer a variety of cocktails that are great too!  My last visit I took a friend who is new to the area. We were both hesitant on going since the reviews on Yelp were not as great as some others in the area. I insisted since I've been here once before that it would be a great time. We were able to get a nice seat outside. Our server was Rubin who was awesome! He is actually the bartender there but was helping out the servers. I really appreciated his honest suggestions on the dishes and enthusiasm. I couldn't remember what drink I had the first time there. Rubin asked me what do I normally like and offered to throw something together. Whatever it was ...it was PERFECT! It wasn't on the menu so there isn't unfortunately a name for it that i can share with you. It had a perfect amount of a sweet flavor (too sweet gives me headaches) without tasting any alcohol. Now I always recommend people to look for Rubin if they go there. As for food - I've had the hummus, street tacos, cauliflower bites, and margarita pizza. The cauliflower bites are eh but otherwise I recommend the others.  I def will be back and will bring people with me!"}
{"text":"Went there for New Year's Eve, and definitely not up to the usual D'Vine standards - particularly for the price. Only thing memorable on the menu was the bisque and desert (set menu - seafood or beef). Started with the obviously new/inexperienced hostess wanting to seat us at a high 4-top near the door, even though we were some of the first people there for the late seating. Besides the noise from the bar and music speakers, it was right next to where the music would start soon. The hostess was adamant that was the only seating she had, even with reservations, but the manager got that straightened out, and it turned out that there were several empty tables in the back during dinner, so no clue why the hostess was jerking us around. Then came the food - the strangest thing served was a large octopus tentacle that frankly looked like an animal's private part, was burnt, and chewed like rubber. I had the Chilean sea bass, which wouldn't have been bad, but it was served on a bed of cold humus, which gave it a weird taste. At any rate, not a very good meal for the cost and the occasion. Guess we'll skip holiday events there, as they appear challenging for them, and stick to going in for wine and appetizers...."}
{"text":"Great dishes and wine! Highly recommend if you're in the area, especially if you want and nice, chilled atmosphere. Live music and an amazing vibe in this nice corner of Mesa."}
{"text":"Amazing and amazing!!!!! The food is amazing everything is tasty and exquisite. My wife is a vegetarian and she is never disappointed. The chef always has wonderful options for her. Then for me it is very difficult to decide it is all perfect. The live entertainment is very nice. It is a pleasure to enjoy.  Then we talk about the staff. Jackie is so sweet and helpful! Then Ruben he is amazing the suggestions he provides are spot on and just enhances the evening. Our go to place when home!!"}
{"text":"This place has everything. Romantic setting and food to die for. The owner is secure me to none and Ruben the bartender may be the best in the business. Intimate live music on Wednesday and the weekends. Oh, and try the mushroom tacos for the love of everything good on this planet!!!"}
{"text":"The mrs and I have been to D'Vine several times and we have always enjoyed it. Love the local beers, great wine, happy hour specials and live music! The meatballs are too die for!"}
{"text":"Always an amazing dining experience at D'Vine! Chef Ramon has a killer menu. Haven't tried anything that I didn't like."}
{"text":"Great food and wine selection. My pick for catching up with a friend or a date night. The energy level ranges so not always a good spot if your looking for a lively bar scene."}
{"text":"We have been looking for a 'go to'  restaurant near our house, and after being disappointed by a few places tried here. The food was good, the place was packed, and our waiter was nice and helpful. Due to the packed house we sat on the couch while we waited and each had a drink, I was excited to see that they had a nice Riesling on the glass list. They had some interesting takes on some traditional dishes (my husband's lasagna was a fresh made type, not the traditional casserole) but both entrees were good. My scallop dish had a beet purée, which was good, but was a little overwhelming as it covered the whole plate. Our apps were good, we tried 3 bruschetta's which all had good flavor, but the bread could have been crispier. We had dessert which we don't often do, and the chocolate cake was great.  All in all, the food was good. Definitely much better than the place just across the sidewalk, but this good food also comes at a higher price point. We'll be back, but I think I'll keep looking for my new favorite place."}
{"text":"Good service, and okay wine selection. Food was below average lack of flavor, not cooked to correct temperate. So many people have recommend this as a must try restaurant, it is not worth a 2nd visit. Prices are priced well for the items they sold however the quality of ingredients and preparation of food served was equal to a home prepared meal."}
{"text":"I was a bit concerned as we walked up to this place. I mean, it was a little foofy looking for an #evfn. But I was pleasantly surprised.  While the beer selection wasn't stellar, it IS a wine bar. And from what I understand, the wine was quite good. Same goes for the food: top notch. Good enough for my wife to take our 17 year-old son and his girlfriend back the next week. That counts for something.  Sit outside if you can. The pit is great and the live entertainment is very nice. The servers really know what they are doing and will go out of their way to take care of you."}
{"text":"The ambience was great. The portions and quality of the food was awesome! The Sangria was amazing, it made me so tipsy. The live entertainment was a plus!!! Would eat here again. The best part was the Baked Brie....my goodness, I have no words."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, live music, If your a wine buff it's great too. Food was good. I ordered a chicken breast and got something that looked like a wing. They gave me some fancy name for the breast but I was disappointed. Salmon was excellent however \"sticky purple\"  rice was awful. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"I went to D'vine because I heard they had a really good wine list and they try to have stuff that other place's in Phoenix do not have.  I don't know if that part is true but they did have a very large list and what we tried was very good.  The staff were knowledgeable.  The food was very good and it was a good surrounding you could sit inside or out while listening to live entertainment a short distance away which really added to the night."}
{"text":"This was our first time here.  Seated and brought water immediately.  The water had a thin slice of cucumber in it that gave it a refreshing taste.  We started with bruschetta.  The Brie/apple and chipotle were excellent.  The smoked salmon was so-so.  Next we had the Vindaloo meatballs.  There were two huge meatballs on the plate.  Be warned they are rather spicy but we thoroughly enjoyed them.  Jacob was our server and he did an excellent job.  Many regulars coming in knew him by name.  Also our waters were regularly checked to make sure they were full.  With so many interesting items on the menu we will definitely be back.  Do yourself a favor and try this establishment."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food was amazing and our server Cory was great! We ordered bruschetta and a thin crust pizza and we left very impressed! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"A nice selection of appetizers, not the typical bar types(wings&skins). And, a wine list by the glass that gives you good choices."}
{"text":"Ordered a grilled chicken salad and sangria.  The dressing on the salad was very tasty.  Shared some tapas with my sister- the brie/apple/almond combo was delicious. Great ambiance -- dim lighting, friendly wait staff, and a wall dedicated to wines alone.  Live musician playing cover songs on acoustic guitar - phenomenal.  In addition, they held a wine tasting and I got a little lesson on wines! Hope to come back again the next time I am in town"}
{"text":"I have been to this place four times. The first time, my husband and I went there on a date. We loved sharing the bruschetta appetizer and calamari. That was the night I fell in love with the Pink Puppy - a wonderful combo of sweet grapefruit juice and vodka. The food and service were just ok.   Another time, I met a group of girlfriends there, and we tried some nice glasses of wine, and shared appetizers. It was a busy night, and the service was pretty bad. My friends were not impressed.  The third time, I took my friend that's a foodie, and she hated it - the hot food came out luke warm, some things over cooked, others had bland sauces. All in all, very disappointing.  The final time, we met our friends there who love the place and know all the staff and chef. This was a completely different and pleasant experience. Food was amazing and service was perfect.  Be prepared to either love or hate this place. I have seen both. I gave it a three because that Pink Puppy was so so good, the wine list is great. Food is hit and miss, and service can be terrible."}
{"text":"This was my second time at D Vine and it was a pleasant evening. I'm not a big wine drinker so I didn't try any but the food that I ordered was very nicely done and tasty. My date gobbled his up, so he must've been happy. The service was a little on the slow side. Our food took a little while to come out but our waiter was nice and kept us filled with water. I recommend going on a Monday night since there was no live music. I've been to this place when there is live music and if you are looking to hold a conversation while loud music is playing, you will be asking your date to repeat things twice. Other than that, I love the atmosphere of the place. I find it to be very cozy.  In conclusion, I think the service and food have improved since my last visit there. The first review I gave it two stars. This time I give it four and would happily go back again."}
{"text":"We had a guest from out of town and went for dinner.  What a delight.  We decided to share all dishes order on the table instead of each ordering an individual meal.  Great food and service. Started with Bruschetta: (Brie, artichoke, salmon), Tapas: Salmon, Calamari, Tomato and Chorizo and shared the black and blue salad.  PERFECT evening.  Cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Great food,  exquisite wines and incomparable service! A very affordable eloquence sorely needed in this neighborhood!.  It's about time: this  restaurant reeks with quality.  Each meal is definitely to write home about accompanied by art museum quality paintings and  examples of professional photos.  Never a dull moment with plenty of intellectual discussions at each table.  What is it that Arnold says,  ' Ill be back , baby!'"}
{"text":"Maybe we hit a bad night when the chef was off, but the three of us decided that we would give this place a pass from now on. Tuesday night, quiet, we waited 30 minutes for the food. When it came it was over cooked and tasteless. Sorry d'vine but for what we had it was expensive and the excuses from the waiter about the delay for the food did not ring true. It's a shame because I enjoyed the place the first time we came."}
{"text":"Love  D'Vine.was looking for something new to eat. Odered the duck. WOW! DELICIOUS! The charming bartender, Ruben is very hospitable and great helping with sugges6on food & wine.  Cozy atmosphere..."}
{"text":"Their food is always excellent, no matter what I've ordered (though I must say I love the Salmon salad with jalapeno dressing and the butternut squash ravioli with truffle oil). The firepit is relaxing. The music is fun. The service is sketchy...touch and go. Don't go if you've got a timeline."}
{"text":"This place has done it right. It has a comfortable atmosphere and yet it is entertaining and classy all at the same time. There is live music on the weekends. The happy hour special s are excellent. I am working on trying every single dish on the happy hour menu. The bruschetta is a must! They have a lot of choices on their wines too. The slice of cucumber in my water becomes the cherry on top to this wonderful place hidden in Mesa."}
{"text":"What a cute little wine bar in Mesa! I came here on a Monday night and was pleasantly surprised! I tried the smoked salmon platter, Kyran pizza, fish tacos, and truffle cake. I also loved the live band that was playing. The waiter was so very nice to us and I even ran into some faculty members from my school here on the same night. The place was packed with people! That's something I don't see too often on a Monday night! I will have to say, out of everything I loved the truffle chocolate cake the most! Paired with a Pinot Noir wine was perfect! Eating the chocolate truffle cake was like eating 20 delicious chocolate truffles from Godiva! I will admit though, I do like the fish tacos from Rubio's much better than the ones here and I prefer pizza from CPK or Pizzeria Bianco. I did enjoy the salmon platter though! Tasted fresh and loved pairing this with the wine! I will have to come back for the chocolate truffle cake!"}
{"text":"highly recommended!!!  food, staff and entertainment are excellent. you will love it!"}
{"text":"If you like wine paired with great food (with a focus on the wine) this is a really great spot.  It's located in Mesa so it's a bit of a drive - take a designated driver.  ;)  Their wine pairing dinners do not disappoint.  They have brought the actual winery owner in for these events so they are very personal.  They even have a decent wine club.  For $30 every month you get two bottles of wine plus some other perks/discounts.    Enjoy!  Oh, and their Black and Blue Salad is to die for and perfect for low-carb people.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"We decided to stop in as we wanted to enjoy some music on a Saturday night.  A guy named Paris James was playing and we love blues so we were excited to go!  We ordered three share plates that did not disappoint (bruschetta, street tacos which are delicious by the way and the stuffed mushroom) which was also very tasty! Great food and the music was awesome!! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is a great neighborhood wine bar I come here all the time the people are amazing great service. I normally get the fried chicken for dinner it is awesome. The mashed potatoes are out of this world definitely have to try them out."}
{"text":"What an awesome find!  This classy yet cute restaurant was by far our favorite  dining adventure during our short Arizona vacation recently. As soon as we entered, the artwork drew us in, seriously ...like a gallery! The inside area was beautiful, but we decided to dine alfresco. They even have a fire pit and torches outside! Well, as impressed as I was with the ambience, as they say, \"the proof is in the pudding\", and although we had no pudding, our meals sealed the deal.  We chose the cheese platter, hummus, and smoked almonds as our apps...all were quickly and happily devoured. I am still craving the smoked almonds..OMG! A must try. We were 3 couples, and all the menfolk ordered the salmon. My hubby is usually a straight on grilled fish sort of guy, but ordered it chef's way and it was perfect....and not over sauced. We gals ordered the scallop salads. Scallops were cooked and seasoned perfectly!! I only regret they we didn't order more of a variety of entrees so we could have sampled more and living in So Cal, it may be a while before we get back there!! Oh...I almost forgot one of the most important part of dinner!!! The WINE! Our waiter, Mike, was so knowledgable and helped us choose quite a variety. I'm just so glad we LYFTed from our hotel, as we also did a little more imbibing at their bar after dinner!! Highly recommend this dining experience and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Not a place in the valley I would rather eat.  Gary the waiter, is DVine and the chef does it all up right.  They serve fabulous appetizers, I have tried everything at least once.  Great place to go alone or with friends.  They have a very nice wine list including my all time favorite-Eleseo Silva Merlot!  Had our Company meetings here and were given a nice quiet spot in the back."}
{"text":"stopped by d'vine last thursday for happy hour.  the hh menu consisted of $5.00 glass of wines, $1 dollar off draft beer and hh appetizer menu of 10 or so items.   the staff were friendly but not so attentive.  i ordered sweet potato fries and the server forgot about my fries? after reminding the server about my order....... they finally come out about 20 minutes later.  overall had a nice time with the lovely ladies: Aly d & Aileen b, however don't think that I would return when there are so many great wine bars in the valley.  it's actually 2.5 but I am rounding up to 3.0."}
{"text":"We love this place. The food is always good and the wine selection is great. The music is a nice benefit."}
{"text":"Not so great.  I have been here s few times because it's in my area, super cute and I've had a couple of good experiences.  Tonight was one of the so-so visits.    The food was all under seasoned although the ingredients were fresh.  No salt and pepper on the table and our server didn't come back for almost 20 minutes after we got our burrata appetizer so it was long gone before I could even ask for salt .  My salad was 89% romaine lettuce and not what I was hoping for after paying $13 for it.  I barely ate it.  In my opinion, the overall bill for this establishment is too high for the level of service, decor and food.  It's all \"OK\" but not what I would go back for at the price."}
{"text":"I have been here  a few times. The first time was about 3 years ago and then twice in the past couple of months. My wife bought a \"wine club\" membership which offers two bottles of wine per month. Pretty good  deal really.  I have to say that I hadn't come back since the first visit as I can't recall being overly impressed. Soooo...3 years later the 2nd visit was enjoyable. For apps: We had the shrimp with spicy chili sauce, sweet potato fries and the pork belly sliders. The shrimp app was good, the pork sliders came out on rocks pretending to be buns. I'm normally not a fan of sweet potato fries but they and the chipotle aoli they were served with were good. I can't recall what main dish I had unfortunately. I guess that speaks for itself!  We visited D'vine again last night. The first month of the club we had a Chard and a Pinot Noir. Both were good. This time we had an Italian Pinot Gris. Perfect for a summer quencher.  We ordered the shrimp and fries again. Then added some green salads and fish tacos.  The fish tacos caught our eye as the menu stated a sriracha mayo/sauce.  Turned out to be the perfect kick for the breaded fish.  We'll be back to exhaust the wine membership over the next couple of months, I'm hoping the experience gets better and we try other dishes that attempt to assure my return."}
{"text":"The food is great, their chef is amazing. Excellent selection of wines, with wine tastings on Wednesday's. Their bartender, Ruben, is one of the best bartenders I've ever been served by. The manager, Kelli, is friendly and always gets to know customers. Great fall patio hangout spot, too."}
{"text":"Appetizers and moscato wine are good here.  They use to have a great Thursday night band."}
{"text":"I hate to give this one star, because our server was fine and the atmosphere was relaxing... The problem came to the food. I ordered a Chicken Cesar Salad and it had lots of lettuce, four slight pieces of chicken, BUT they forgot the dressing. It was wet lettuce with soggy croutons and not even a fleck of pepper. The waiter was VERY busy so getting his attention to fix the problem was not going to happen. I just think if you're going to pay top dollar for a salad, it should have the dressing.... But if this is the worst thing that ever happens to me, I'll be fine...."}
{"text":"A hidden gem of Chandler! My parents, boyfriend and I frequent this place often. I highly recommend their chipotle Alfredo with chicken or the pot roast! We always order the bruschetta as an appetizer. You have the choice of picking between all of the different ones they offer, but our favorite is the one with avocado (not sure what the name is... It has avocado OK!) so we only order the avocado one for our platter.  That pot roast is just mouth watering. It has great flavor and melts in your mouth.  Their patio area is so charming and is generally a great place to enjoy a few glasses of wine. My mom and I sit out on the patio together, drink wine and talk stories through the night.  So, recap: avocado bruschetta, pot roast and patio seating. Oh! They also have live music on the weekends. And from what I've heard, it is beautiful and relaxing."}
{"text":"Wow what a great place to eat!!! The wine list is amazing and the food was out of this world."}
{"text":"This place has the best happy hour food - haven't had anything that wasn't so yummy!  Dinner menu is a little different but also quite good - great bartenders here!"}
{"text":"Came here for our friends surprise party. Excellent service and great happy hour menu with lots of tasty choices! We had the deviled eggs, buffalo chicken, the empanada and the artichoke dip. Only reason I'm not giving 5 star is because they didn't have too much as far as cocktails to choose from! Otherwise, great place!!!"}
{"text":"I always love this place. It's been where I've spent new years,valentine's day & anniversaries. But last night I was disappointed. The pizza we had for an app was over cooked and undercooked at the same time. boo. Then the skirt steak I had for dinner was alright but the horse radish potato cake that it came with had the consistency of Elmer's glue. It ruined the meal. I want to know who tasted that and thought it was good enough to serve. Gross gross."}
{"text":"I have been dying to get to this place. First my server was the freaking bomb. Adam was great. The patio seating was very relaxing after running all morning. The menu had a lg variety. It's more upscale from the living room which I love. The food portion was huge we shared fish tacos & stuffed mushrooms & was satisfied."}
{"text":"This place was weird. I felt like it was a weird crowd and weird people and just weird. We got the flight of white wine  (i dont remember which ones) which were good I suppose. We tried their apple and brie cheese bruschetta  and it was not very good at all. Just apple and brie cheese, thats it, nothing more, nothing less. Nothing like Postino wine bar's apple and brie cheese bruschetta (maybe theirs is so delicious that nothing compares.) They have art work all over which is neat. Other than that, I was just weirded out by this place. My friends always go to the other location and love it so maybe I will like this place better   if I go to that location, I don't know. Maybe it was a full moon that night that I went? Ha I don't know."}
{"text":"Whenever I have friends visit me from out of town, I take them to D'Vine (for the contemporary atmosphere and it's close to where I live). I can't say there are any entrees that stand out in taste, but the food presentation is always top notch...like work of art!  But the real smash hit is always the DESSERT!  If anything fails, order the dessert! This may be my favorite place for dessert of all Mesa! If you want something light, I recommend the Crème brûlée. If you feel like something rich and seductive, the Kahlua Chocolate Mousse cake with raspberry sauce...gasp...D'vine!"}
{"text":"Second visit here and I remain pleased with the excellent service and good food.  I had a garden salad to start, and the simple serving was just the right size and the ingredients were fresh. One of our party got some spicy chicken poppers (sorry, not sure if title is correct). I tried one and thought it was pretty tasty. Two burgers, a salmon salad, crab cakes and fish tacos rounded out the main courses. I had a burger -- it was unremarkable.  I asked for medium and it arrived well done, but that wasn't a huge foul for me.    As previously noted, Service was very good -- thank you Nubia -- and the barkeep makes a decent Old Fashioned. All in all, a solid establishment.   Cheers! RL"}
{"text":"We have been back several times, and the quality of the food and service could best be described as 'much improved'... definitely worth a try if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness went there yesterday which wasn't my first but the food from yesterday was so good! Went around 1:30 and my husband ordered a sandwich I had a scallop salad that was jus divine! We also had appetizers that were delicious!  I do recommend that they clean up the cob webs the walls. They are quite notable with the darkness of the room. I saw a bunch where we were sitting!"}
{"text":"Get the specials! They change frequently, but almost always a treat!! From 2014-2015 we used to dine here every other week. Chef is excellent, food is fabulous, service is great. The menu changes seasonally, but the fish n chips is one of my constant favs."}
{"text":"D'Vine has become a home-away-from-home for my husband and I. We go at least once a week. We love the wine, the people, the music, the atmosphere.  At first, we went just for the wine and the atmosphere, both of which are top notch. The exposure to good wine here has ruined our wine experience at regular restaurants. The atmosphere is sophisticated and modern, while casual and comfortable.  My initial impression of the servers was that they were a bit snobby, but we continued to come for the reasons above. That has totally changed -- we LOVE the servers now. I don't know if it's because they've gotten to know us as regulars, or if they weeded out the snobby servers. Whatever happened, they're super friendly to us now.  Lesley is our favorite server and we always request her when we go. She always has a lot of information about the wines and she knows how to recommend new wines for us based on what we already like. She always picks good ones in a decent price-range (Artessa Elements is our favorite).  There is live music every single night and they have a yearly music festival and wine-tastings. They also have a wine club, which we joined. You get two free bottles of wine every month to take home. You also get 10% off the first bottle of the night when you drink there at the venue.  As for the food: we are vegan and they are quite limited when it comes to trying to eat an actual meal if you are vegetarian, let alone vegan. Here is what we eat:  1) Olives  We tell them not to add the cheese. They marinate the olives every day with rosemary. There are about 5 varieties of olives and they are always fat and firm. These are the best olives we've had anywhere, and now other olives just aren't as enjoyable. We're olive freaks, so that says something.  2) Traditional Bruscetta This is just damn good bruscetta. That's all I have to say about it.  3) Hummus Some of the best hummus around, in our opinion. Perfect texture and flavor. We're hummus freaks, too.  4) Squash Salad That's probably not the full name of this salad. I don't love eating salad at restaurants, but this one is delish. Sometimes I crave it and it's always satisfying.  I think we've also special ordered pizza with no cheese (we like to have basil added), as well as pasta."}
{"text":"Random choice when we had an hour to kill on a Saturday evening. In a full restaurant we were sat within a minute on the patio, setup and served drinks within very few more. Our appetizers were great, and creative.  The wait staff were personable, friendly, and fast. Great stop, definitely a go for dinner."}
{"text":"I hope I got this location right because I didn't drive and wasn't exactly sure where we were but I had my birthday dinner here with two of my oldest and dearest friends. They had live music playing, and we were seated right away even though it looked like a decent full crowd. Service was excellent and cocktails and appetizers served right up. My friend has stuffed mushrooms which were very good, and I had edaname which was a little greasy but flavorful. Main course for me was the Salmon over Butternut Squash risotto and it was delicious. A little heavy on black pepper for me but the rest of the flavors were phenomenal. My friend has the Wild Boar which he enjoyed but was a little unimpressed with the portion size. My other friend had the salmon on special which she enjoyed as well.  A round of fireball shots, a round of Jaeger shots and we had a great night out. Only negative was the music stopped at 11pm and the place basically shut down then....early for a Friday night."}
{"text":"Second time here.  Food is yummy and fun for east Mesa. We will be back cuz Carly rocks!!"}
{"text":"We had a really good experience at D'Vine. Both the food and the service were excellent. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Met up with a friend after work, we were delighted to discover that it was Ladies Night! $2 off glasses of wine and bruschetta. There was no wait to be seated, and the atmosphere was cozy - there was even a little pillow for my back on the booth seat!   Our waitress, Tak, was very friendly and helpful in her suggestions. We drank wine, split an order of bruschetta, enjoyed a nice salad; I got the black and blue. The bruschetta was a thin bread, so we mostly tasted the toppings - yum! You know how sometimes a restaurant salad is mostly lettuce and you're still hungry? This was not one of those salads. It was a nice size, and had plenty of steak and other veggies.  We decided to go for dessert. Tak recommended the Almond Joy, a fabulous cocktail that really did taste like the candy bar. We still ordered a chocolate torte, which was also delicious, and drizzled with raspberry sauce.   We had a lovely evening and everything we ordered was tasty. I would go back without hesitation."}
{"text":"Usually good food, but sometimes has issues with consistency. I was here 2 days ago and the hummus plate was outstanding. Today it is chunky and watered down. The bruschetta is usually good, today it was burned. In an effort to try to stay \"fresh\" they remove some of the best menu items. No more chipotle hummus, got rid of Pig Wings which were awesome (until next season) out of potstickers, out of miller light, no chicken bites!! Come on D'Vine. Live up to your name, stop getting us hooked on delicious menu items then getting rid of them, and get more consistent with your quality."}
{"text":"I was hoping I'd be the first to review D'Vine. Why? Well, for selfish reasons, of course. I wanted to be the one to say, \"Look at this spectacular place! It's a gem!\" Certainly, I can say that regardless of if I'm the first review or the 150th.   What makes this place so great? Maybe it's the intimate setting they've created with dim lighting, impeccable service, the wide wine selection, the savory menu or the fact they host live music, including local bands like Ten Dollar Outfit.   Don't want to sit inside? No problem. They have a comfortable patio with misters. Simple candles adorn the tabletops.   Don't want to sit in the heat? Select a comfortable vantage point on one of their comfy couches, sit at the bar and chat with the staff (or your date, for that matter) or sit at a table for two (bar table heights available).   Another great quality of this place is the art that adds a certain flavor to the place.   I also enjoy perusing their wine selection, for they sale by the bottle, too. May I recommend the Victor Hugo or Matchbox blends.   When you need the perfect wine, red or blend for a dinner, simply stop in and ask for their preferences. Tell them what's on the menu. Whether it's lobster, chicken or pork, they'll have the perfect recommendation for you. They certainly did for me, and the wine I brought for a certain occasion last summer definitely made an impression!   The location isn't the best (yet it's not the worst, by any means) .Then again, if it were anywhere else, it would be swarming with unappreciative patrons. Instead, this is more of a treasure to people in Mesa who enjoy a relaxing, joyful night out of the house.  For more, visit their website: http://www.dvinewine101.com/"}
{"text":"This is a charming little restaurant in Mesa. I didn't think I would like it as much as I did.  The restaurant is small, quaint, with a nice outdoor seating area. It's located in a shopping strip, so there's plenty of parking. Staff are friendly and nice.  I like that they rotate their wines frequently based on availability. Prices are reasonable for either a glass or bottle, so you can spend quite a bit or not much at all depending on your mood. I tried a glass of Syrah, which was lovely.  I had the bruschetta with caprese, brie, and chipotle/avocado. The caprese was good, the brie was refreshing and light, and the chipotle/avocado was really flavorful - probably my favorite. I thought the prices were reasonable given portion size and flavor.  D'Vine is a bit out of the way for me, so I don't think I'd make a special trip. However, if I was in the area, I would be more than happy to stop in. If you live nearby or like wine bars, I would definitely give D'Vine a try."}
{"text":"Average experience. Food not my kind of food. Practically no options if you want to eat plant based. I had traditional bruschetta which was good. Marinara pasta tasted like barbecue sauce was added. Very odd. Table was very worn out looking. Music was awful. Wanted to like this night out, but I'm leaving with a head ache."}
{"text":"Been here twice now, and we are very pleased. Everyone, from the greeter, to the servers and bussers are very friendly and committed to great customer service. Food is pretty good. We share an entree of fish n chips with an app and salad, quite ample for two. A tad pricey, but they've got a good musician and they're in the high rent district. Very nice neighborhood wine bistro. Our server, Tak, is a gem!!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place!!  The staff is so friendly, the wine selection is good and the food, especially the happy hour appetizers, are really tasty. We love to go here and chat with the bartenders and have a nice relaxing time."}
{"text":"Went here to celebrate an event with a group of about 15 people.  I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised!  For some reason. I thought this place would have an atmosphere that was a bit on the hoity toity side (not sure that's a real word..lol). Anyway, I was wrong.  While the restaurant itself is very nice, but the atmosphere felt very casual..which I really like.    The service was excellent - especially given the large group I was with.  We asked to split bills and the waitress was so pleasant about everything. I ordered and appetizer, which was the sliders with fries.  My only slight complaint is that while the price was good, the \"sliders\" was a slider....it was more funny than anything but it was tasty.  I will definitely be going back...nice place for a girls night out or dinner with my husband!"}
{"text":"My favorite place for Bruschetta and Sangria.  The Brie bruschetta is amazing.  Serve some very different and excellent cocktails, I've enjoyed every one that I have tried so far."}
{"text":"My favorite place in the Valley; It is like the tv show Cheers,...everyone is friendly and nice and both the food and wine selections are AWESOME!!!!  Never had a bad meal and the wine tastings are educational and affordable."}
{"text":"Ive never been to this restaurant in Chandler and figured I would give it a try.   The restaurant is a bit dark and definitely gives you a romantic atmosphere for two. We ordered a BBQ pork belly as an appetizer. The meat was so tender that it falls off the bones (I highly recommend it). For main entree, I ordered the Ahi Tuna bowl with chicken fried rice. Even though the presentation is great, it definitely needs some more seasoning to make it tasty. Overall, it was a bit blend. With my luck, my server is actually Asian. As soon as she saw the look on my face when the dish arrived, she brought out a side of wasabi sauce, soy sauce as well as marinated with Ginger without asking for additional flavor for my dish. She sure knows how to hook up her people :-) thank you Tak. I also took a bit of the handmade pasta and it was actually very delicious.   Service was exceptional and she even introduce us other goodies we can try on our next visit. I will definitely come back here again to try other appetizers. If you are a wine drinker, they do have a huge selections on the menu."}
