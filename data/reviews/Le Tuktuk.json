{"text":"Food: We had the Green Papaya Salad, well seasoned and \"enough\" kick to keep you addicted and wanting for more. They use whole peanuts which I like and added some other ingredients as their variations as carrots and tomatoes. Great taste!

Service: Staff are friendly and joyful~

Value: Overpriced for a small salad~"}
{"text":"The mains that we tried were ordinary (pad thai's). However the mango salad and papaya salad are quite awesome and totally worth going out of your way for!! 
Portions are very filling."}
{"text":"Tuk Tuk is amoung one of the best values in the Montreal food truck scene. I really enjoy their Pad Thai and the Green Papaya Salad. Both servings are very generous meal sized so you won't walkaway hungry."}
{"text":"J'y suis allez juste pour combler un désir sucré.

J'ai donc goûté à la banane frit. C'etait excellent, et je ne m'attendais pas à en avoir autant dans la barquette. Heureusement on se la partageait avec une amie.

D'autre de leurs plats Thai m'interesse mais je ne les ai pas encore goûté, on verra ça dans les prochaines semaine =).

Donc avis qui sera mis à jour bientot =)."}
{"text":"Great, convenient Thai food! I had their fried rice and it was on the oily end, but very delicious and their portions are large. It wasn't that authentic as I don't think it would regularly have a medley of frozen vegetables - corn, peas, carrots, beans. But anyhow, it was a nice addition and the rice is more than enough for a lunch. Staff are all super friendly and service is quick."}
{"text":"The portions are good but I wouldn't say \"generous\" as some other reviewers have indicated. I guess if you compare them to other food truck portions you can say \"generous\" - but one thing is for sure, you won't be hungry afterwards! I tried the mango salad and the chicken pad thai. I was impressed with both of them!  The mango salad was perfectly balanced  and bright with just the right amount of peanuts. The pad thai was slightly spicy (as requested) and piping hot. Over all - a great choice!"}
{"text":"Yay for real Thai food! Or almost?

Love the shrimp pad thai, generous serving and big shrimps - although the crab fried rice had a mix of frozen veggies (corn, peas, carrots and beans) that I'm not used to seing in the land of smiles. It was bland without adding your own soy sauce and really needs more fish sauce. For 10$ a portion, it is a fair price and a step up from your food court asian cuisine however it was lacking a certain flare. Being part Thai and having lived/traveled in and around the country, the food was good but didn't quite bring me back to what I was used to. 

More seasoning, spice, lemongrass and cilantro please!"}
