{"text":"Back at my favorite pizza place for lunch after learning that they brought back the original Amatriciana pizza. Amazing. It's not Pittsburgh pizza- don't come here expecting Mineo's or sweet sauce. This is real Italian-style innovative pizza.   Insider tip: they have excellent anchovies if you ask. Also, get the fresh mozzarella if you're there on a weekend evening.   Thanks to Tony for the great experience."}
{"text":"This is some delicious pizza! We had the Jackie and the Ricotta Pie. Both were fantastic. They  have yummy desserts and it is BYOB also. I would definitely go back--I'd like to try the cauliflower pizza next! It's a nice space inside, also."}
{"text":"Been here twice now and will definitely come back again! This little spot in E. Liberty is pleasant and open, with a simple menu of authentic pizzas with some unique offerings. I'm a margarita pizza connoisseur and they have some of the best in town! Service is friendly and personal; an overall pleasant experience each time! You can enjoy your pizza with San Pellegrino or Italian cappuccino and almost feel like you're in a cafe in Rome!"}
{"text":"Having lived in great foodie towns, from the San Francisco Bay Area, all the way to Durham, NC, I have enjoyed more than a few pizzas. The assortment of artisan pizzas at Pizza Taglio were some of the most creative and delicious I have tasted. Tony's  array of cheeses and aged meats served up on rustic homemade crusts reminded me of my travels to Italy. The spicey honey condiment added a surprisingly tasty twist. We ended the meal with some sweet and creamy spumoni, complements of the chef. Whether you are passing through on business or have lived in Pittsburgh your whole life, I highly recommend you visit this new Pittsburgh treasure for a relaxing and delicious meal!"}
{"text":"Very good pizza!  Tried it for the first time tonight.  The price is definitely reasonable for what you get - taste, originality, quantity.  My wife and I got a pie for each of us and we had three slices total left over.  The quality is also really good.  I like how they show you on the menu who their suppliers are.  It gives you confidence that you are getting a good pizza.  There is the perfect amount of burnt on the crust.  Definitely get the pizza with the honey - excellent combination of spicy and sweet."}
{"text":"Well well finally met a pizza that I liked sooo much I ate all of the pie.. Creative, delicious, not greasy, thin crust, and tah dah canolis for dessert.. Delisio.."}
{"text":"Update........  It's been a month since Pizza Taglio opened. We have returned three times since. The last time was this past weekend and things have changed for the better. First if all, I was amazed how much faster Tony made the pizza. He handled a room full of orders like a pro and we received our pizza in no time. Secondly, I was impressed of how much more improved and attentive the service was this time. Our server was a short haired blonde and she bent over backwards to make our experience a good one. We were also stunned how the other servers were also helping with water, asking if we needed anything and clearing our plates. Bravo for Tony for creating a team attitude for service excellence and improving so much. Food wise.... I tried his white pizza named 'Jackie' this last time. I am not a white pizza kind-of-guy but that truffle made that pizza to die for. I know I was taught not to end a sentence with a preposition... But it's pizza we are talking about!!!! It was fantastic. Do yourself a favor and go for it! You have to have the mindset of old world Italy when eating here. The owner will come to your table and make you feel like you are family while you are eating the best ingredients you can buy. If something isn't right, he will take care of it! Treat yourselves this weekend..... You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I sat in traffic for 35 min to come here for pizza. The pizza is so good, I will sit in traffic anytime for their pizza. I can't remember when I had a better pie. We had the salad, green pointer pizza and adios anoia pizza. It was all to die for.  It's a byob place so don't leave home without it. But if you do, there's a State store a block away."}
{"text":"Good pizza. On par with Mercurio's Margarita pizza. But holy christ is it expensive. I payed almost $16 for the pan sized margarita pizza (size of a frisbee) which is 95% dough!  The pan sized pizzas need more sauce on them. And the crusts are too big. Because the crusts are so large (by the miracle of physics) gravity forces all the sauce downwards to the center. Thus creating a soggy shit show in the middle, much like the Drumpf presidency. If I wanted to pay $16 to eat dry dough I could go to Whole Foods and buy a baguette. I'd save $15...or I could also just ask a Drumpf supporter to punch me in the face, again, saving me $15."}
{"text":"So so so excited for Pizza Taglio to have opened in this neighborhood. Fresh ingredients, awesome combinations, really great and friendly staff. I'm in love with the hot honey pie. WOW! Will be challenging not to hit this place up multiple times a week."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh is growing fast. Just three years ago, there were barely any places to buy fancy pizza. Also, you would drop about $15 to get dough... and maybe an afterthought of cheese (albeit, delicious, delicious cheese) and half a sneeze worth of toppings. While those restaurants were able to keep my belly happy, a recent outburst of similarly priced or cheaper restaurants with the same quality ingredients (and more of it) has popped up around the city, giving those old ones some competition.  Pizza Taglio provides unique, creative topping combinations on top of fresh dough. The crust was absolutely perfect: crunchy on the outside with a little bit of chewiness in the inside. The mozzarella was fresh and did that awesome gooey stretching that you would delete your internet history for if you watched it for too long. I was boring and got the speck, arugula, mozzarella pizza with blistered tomatoes and balsamic glaze. Simple concept, but not always easy to execute perfectly. I was happily pleased with the ratio of the toppings, the arugula was fresh and spicy, and the speck was fatty and crispy.  In addition, they have really sweet service. Everyone was smiling and we had some great conversations with the people working there. I had a pleasant afternoon.  Overall, I see myself coming back here often on rainy days or simple date nights."}
{"text":"Pizza Taglio's creations surpass the pizza I've had in Italy, by far. They offer flavorful, thin crust pies which stand out from more traditional offerings. The Greenpointer features a dynamic combination of Mike's Hot Honey, along with spicy soppressata and homemade mozzarella. If you prefer a white pizza, the New Ricotta Pie is a great choice, with savory ricotta and fresh Roma tomatoes (there is a ricotta appetizer as well!) The fresh house salad is an excellent starter and is accompanied by the homemade mozzarella.  The trendy, casual atmosphere works well for either a quick bite or date night, and also offers takeout. The service is top-notch, with friendly, prompt attention and information about the menu.  Definitely worth a stop (or more!)"}
{"text":"Soggy crust, 'nuff said. Service could use work, too."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite on a Saturday early evening and were seated quickly. Saw a meat cheese plate (photo added) that was pretty disappointing.... $11 for a few chunks of parmigiana and sliced meat... however their pizza did make up for it. Flavorful and lots of toppings. Got the white pizza with sausage and rosemary, tasted a pizza with hot honey, yum!!!!   In conclusion, go for the pizza , not the cheese plate."}
{"text":"We went here on a Saturday night. The atmosphere was nice and the food was excellent. We got a margherita pizza and a Greenpointer. Both were awesome and we'll definitely go here again. The prices are great, too!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, wonderful atmosphere and friendly staff. Their hot honey is the die for, the owner gave us a bottle of it, we put it on everything! He is amazing. So glad they do take out, because this has become our friday night staple dinner!"}
{"text":"Good thin crust pizza, and probably the thinnest I've ever had. We ordered green pointer and carbanaro. The spicy and sweet flavors went well with each other. I really love it. The center did become a little bit of soggy after a while, but the taste was still good. My friend loved both of them and din't notice the sogginess at all. I'm probably a picky eater. I discussed this with the chef and wondered wether that was due to too much sauce on it. He apologized and enumerated several possible reasons. It was really nice of him to cook a roman focaccia for me.  I'd love to come back to try other flavors."}
{"text":"Holy s, this is good pizza.  Whenever I'm back in town I make sure I stop by for one of their pies.  I think they're still BYOB, but there's a liquor/wine store on the upper level of the outdoor mall across the street. Pro-tip: swing by there for a bottle or three while the rest of your group waits in line for a table.  Don't be a dummy, go eat here now."}
{"text":"This pizza is phenom! Their signature pizzas have the most unique combination of toppings and they are all shockingly delicious. Server was friendly, ambiance is relaxed, and I'm definitely a fan of BYOB. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Terrible ,over priced  Rip off  Thin nothing on it  Store frozen pizza  is better Will never go back"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  I have had pizza in many places, including NYC and Italy: this is the best place.   The service is fantastic, the place is well organized for a new restaurant--despite the snippy comments of another reviewer (who got lost and thought he was in pizza hut as he complained about the lack of paper menus), and the pizza flat out the best you have ever had.   The selection is also great, everything from Margarita pizza to a pizza with spicy Italian meat and honey (was hesitant to try it, but it was sooo good).   Oh, and the cannoli and cappuccino are also fantastic."}
{"text":"The Greenpointer is off the rails. And Tony is a mensch."}
{"text":"Not a 4 for following reasons. This is place to go for pizza and be on your way to evening activity. Tables very tight together. Pizza is acceptable for the price so ok on price to value... But no wow factor. I had the sausage and pepper and regretted not going with the soprsotta topic. Marie had a white pizza with arugula and tomatos etc and she liked it same. We got the antipasta dish of cheese and charcuterie...  And they did not have bread or anything to eat with it??  If you go with a European style...  Then does miss on the basics. Dish Not cheap and not a lot either so value to price not good...  So that is why suggest stick with the pizza and make it a first stop of the night not the destination and you shouldn't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Pizza soup. I have been here twice. The first time was fine but yesterday I was served pizza soup. All the toppings slid right off and I was left with a soggy toppingless slice of limp pizza in my hand and it made me sad.   Pizza taglio has the best ovens you can buy and the best ingredients but clearly they don't know the fundamental rule of making pizza : don't use cold dough or you will end up with pizza soup. When I spend $45 + tip on dinner for two, I expect that the kitchen knows at least the basics about the food they are cooking.   This is a yuppie restaurant. I am a yuppie. As a yuppie eating in a yuppie restaurant, certain expectations must be met."}
{"text":"I've been on a bit of a pizza kick lately so I was looking forward to trying this restaurant.  It did not disappoint.  I went on a Monday evening and it was not busy at all so no problem getting a seat.  The waitress was very nice and informative with my questions.  I decided to try the Greenpointer pizza because I was so curious how honey would taste on it.  The pizza was big, I could easily have shared. And came out nice and hot.  The pizza was delicious, and the honey gave it a perfect sweet kick to the spice of the sopressata.  The pizza was crisp, but the crust at the top was soft, just the way I like it.  I took my leftovers home and happily ate them and unhappily shared a slice with my hubby (I wanted it all myself)."}
{"text":"This is the best authentic Italian pizza that we've ever had in the USA. We got the Margherita and got offered Sicilian oregano on it. It brought the pizza to an entirely different level! Absolutely delicious. We also had the Bob Manleti pizza. It was absolutely delightful, the perfect balance of spicy, smoky, and sweet. At this point we were full and we asked for the sfogliatelle to go. It was absolutely scrumptious as well.  The service was great, atmosphere was relaxed but nice. We loved this place so much that we are going back to dinner tonight. We are visiting from out of town and know that the only way to get pizza like this is in Italy, so we decided to take advantage. I highly recommend this place!  ***Five stars plus***"}
{"text":"I've been there twice so far probably the best gourmet style pizza place in Pittsburgh. There was not a lot of seating in the restaurant however it seems like there was enough room to add at least 5 more tables. I feel like they are not utilizing the space to its fullist potential."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I went in with another couple to bid on a private pizza making class at Pizza Taglio at last year's CFF Brewer's Ball auction. We were recently able to redeem the class, and Tony (the owner) did not disappoint!   Pizza Taglio is one of our favorite joints in the city, and seeing how the pizza is made from start to finish was truly an incredible experience! We especially loved learning how the homemade mozzarella is made, and tasting the finished product. The pizza is delicious-they use a blend of flours in their dough which takes a couple days to make. Sauce is light, bright, and perfect. HIGHLY recommend the Greenpointer, in fact, just go ahead and ask for a hot honey drizzle on anything you order because it puts it over the top! Tony is incredibly passionate and knowledgeable  about pizza-making. We had an amazing time!   Remember to bring a bottle of wine, it's BYOB. For two people, would recommend starting with the arugula salad (fresh mozzarella with a balsamic drizzle is the star here) and at least 2 pizza's. Or 3. There's no such thing as too much leftover pizza."}
{"text":"This is an excellent example of pizza done right. Casual atmosphere, good vibes, tasty food and helpful staff. Bring a good bottle of your favourite stuff and you're set."}
{"text":"I was quite impressed by the pizza. However, I felt this pizza was Neapolitan and not really Roman. I'm not complaining because I far prefer Naples style pizza to Roman style pizza. We had the margarita which was delicious. I also like the Greenpointer. I went easy with the hot honey. Although it is delicious, I do not like too much sweet on my pizza.   The only thing is they don't have much else on the menu except in arugula salad for appetizer and ice cream for dessert. Still worth it. Would go again!"}
{"text":"I'm not one for fancy pizza- I come from the land of five dollar pies (now six dollars) in Oakland. My pizza standards are pretty low, and paying $14 for pizza is not on my to do list.   Nonetheless, we tried this place since it's new. We got the pizza with the egg on it (forget what it's called) and waited probably 20 minutes for it to come out. I know, I know, it's pizza baked in an oven. The pizza was tasty and the dough was good.  Three negatives:   One, they aren't open on Sundays. What the what. We were so disappointed. Yes, we know, you like to have a day off, you have lives. Fine. But being closed for 1/2 of the weekend seems cray.  Two, they don't have a website. When we were trying to order on a Sunday we wanted to see a menu but couldn't because well, there's no website. It costs minimal money to host a website. They do have Twitter and Facebook, but the link to their menu on their FB page is broken. This is nit picky, I know, but I do social meedz on the side, so my standards are high!  Three, it took foooooreveerrrr to get our check. Our waitress disappeared and we were ready to g-o."}
{"text":"Pizza Taglio, I love ya. I might have to say that this is the best gourmet pizza in the 'Burgh. I went here for dinner with 3 friends and we ordered 3 pizzas to split (the best way to go if you ask me). The Greenpointer was a perfect mix of spicy and sweet! I was a little hesitant to try a pizza with honey on it, but the Mike's hot honey was absolutely delicious. By far my favorite one that I tried. I just love how you first tasted the spiciness and then were left with a sweet aftertaste. We also got the Pino (fairly spicy, excellent if you love sausage!) and the Ricotta (great blend of mozzarella and ricotta cheeses and FRESH arugula).   The atmosphere was very cozy. Would make for a great date spot or out to dinner with friends on a cold Pittsburgh evening. Next time I go back I'd like to try out the Carbonara or the Cauliflower...Or both! Be sure to BYOB and I hear that you can ask for extra Mike's hot honey, which is a must!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out from Pizza Taglio, outstandingly satisfying, original pizza."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza! Great location. The pizza with honey on it was fantastic. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Sorry :( There was  fruit fly infestation while we were there tonight. At any time there were four or five flies on my wine glass. We wrapped up our food to go and got out of there.The food however was really good that we had at home and the service was more than apologetic. I just hope they take care of that."}
{"text":"The greenpointer and the Swartz are fantastic-- unique and delicious. BYOB is always nice, too."}
{"text":"They make a great pizza here!! The crust and the toppings are all delicious and the pie comes out quickly. BYOB but the servers are there to assist you. Quite often very crowded but it's pizza is a premier attraction"}
{"text":"In a nutshell: new, hip wood-fired pizza joint in Pittsburgh. Decent menu, a little pricey. Pizzas were ok, but disappointing for the high price tag.   After visiting Paulie Gee's in NY a few years ago, I fell in love with Mike's Hot Honey, which is a chili infused honey. It is to die for on pizza. So when I saw that Pizza Taglio offered a pie (the Greenpointer) similar to Paulie Gee's Honey Hellboy, I was dying to see if Pittsburgh would have its own version of my all-time favorite pie. Not quite. Maybe there's something about the preparation, but the middle of my pizza was very soggy. I'm ok with a droopy pizza slice, but this was very hard to pick up. Parts that weren't soggy  tasted ok but there wasn't very much sopressata. You basically only got one, maybe two bites of sopressata in each slice. My husband got the margherita, which he thinks is a true test of the quality of pie because there's no hiding behind fancy ingredients. Sadly to say, the margherita was not impressive and was pretty bland, overpowered by the flavor of cheese rather than the fresh flavors of a true margherita: the tomatoes and basil.  I have a feeling Pizza Taglio was trying to channel Paulie Gee's with its use and sale of Mike's Hot Honey, along with naming the Mikes Hot Honey pie the \"Greenpointer,\" considering that's where the NY Paulie Gee's is: Greenpoint. Unfortunately, I will have to go back to Paulie Gee's for my hot honey & sopressata pizza fix."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza.. we had the green pointer and the carbonara pizzas and both were fabulous!! Also had the arugula salad which was a great start!"}
{"text":"Friendly & quick service. The pizza was delicious, we had the white asparagus with speck (Italian bacon). I got the hot honey on the side since my hubs didn't want to try it & it was amazingly delicious! It was spicy to me but I kept dipping my crust in it. A little misleading on the alcohol yes, beer & wine info on this Yelp page. It's actually BYOB, I guess I should've read more reviews. I was also disappointed that they no longer make the Nutella calzone as that was one of the reasons I chose to come. It also isn't that great for kids if they are as picky as mine. My boys really enjoyed the plain pizza but didn't like the extra blob of fresh mozzarella & my daughter wouldn't eat it because of that - these kids are something else...sigh. Anyway, I would've loved to try more flavors but it was filling & I had save room for dessert."}
{"text":"I saw this place as I past by it and right away (like 2 months later) I stopped in to try it out with a friend after the gym. It's a nice little pizza place with a very small and simple menu. Ether white or red with X toppings on top. I can't for the life of me remember the name of the pizza we got but it was very very good. It had that soft yet crispy brick oven crust with a wonderful tomato sauce and smokey mozz. This was one of the better pizzas I have had in the US. I mean even the pizza is Rome and Tuscany has a run for it's money with this place. The waitress was nice and very attentive. The guys making the pizzas were also very friendly. I also enjoyed the French windows. We got to sit right by them and enjoyed people watching. This Place is a must try and a good price for the amazing quality of pizza they make. I will be going back here again and again as long as my wallet allows me to."}
{"text":"I'm on the hunt to try all the wood fired pizza in Pittsburgh and Taglio happened to be first!   My go to pizza when trying a new place is always the margharita. It's not pretentious and you can really taste all the elements of it. Theirs was fantastic! It was thin but wasn't so thin that it couldn't hold any toppings. Also, I could tell that they didn't use just white flour. It had a nice nuttiness to it. I asked and they said they now use about 25% whole wheat. They also cold ferment their dough two days. That's what helps with the complex flavors. The next most important thing to me is the sauce. I loved their unadulterated tomato sauce. They use real DOP San Marzano tomatoes and you can tell! It's bright and lovely. I pretty much fell in love with it!   I was greeted when I walked in and told them a friend would join me. I waited at the table and no waiter showed up. I had to go ask the girl if I could put an order in. To make a long story short it got busy and I didn't really see her again. Finally got her to take my card and then waited for another 10 minutes and another girl brought it back.   Overall the pizza really stands alone. I can get over bad service as long as I have good pizza. I will definitely be back again. If you're in the area give them a chance. You never know, you could just fall in love!"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza I've had outside Italy. Inventive pies, fresh ingredients, cool atmosphere, and incredibly reasonably priced. I can't say enough good things about this place!!"}
{"text":"I know I am in Pittsburgh, but I could swear I am in Italy. Delicious authentic pizza.  I had the margherita pizza and could literally taste fresh tomatoes in the sauce."}
{"text":"Good pizza and above average service. Glasses, dishes, and silverware could have been cleaner. If they fix that I would rate a 4.5 or 5.0."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza and friendly staff. We had both a red pizza with spicy sausage and an antipasto platter, followed by cannoli and were impressed with everything. Would definitely recommend.  Love that it is BYOB also!"}
{"text":"I loved Pizza Taglio.  The atmosphere is fan-freaking-tastic.  In a darkened room with classic Italian-American songs playing in the background, it was a really great setting for date night.    The pizza was perfectly doughy, but thin.  These pizzas are a little larger than personal size and are meant to be shared, but my boyfriend and I did not opt for this because 1) we don't really like the same things and 2) we each eat a lot.  I had the Ricotta Pie and ate all of it except the last slice (which heated up great the next day).  My boyfriend had the May the Swartz Be With You and gobbled it up.  The acoustics were a little loud, but it also seemed to add to the vibe.  The restaurant itself is pretty small, I could imagine waiting for a while for a seat.  I think we grabbed the last table when we came in."}
{"text":"Being born and raised in NYC for the 20+ years of my life, I have my good share of both good and bad pizza. During an impromptu trip taking my board exams in Pitt, I found myself wanted to snack on some cheesy goodness. The hotel recommended pizza taglio which was only a 2 block walk away and boy was it good! The green stopper pizza was great especially with the honey oil. The mild amount of sweetness complemented the spicy soppressata perfectly. This is on par with alot of Neapolitan pies that you would find at pizza moto in NYC. Loved and enjoyed every bite!"}
{"text":"Twice I have actually ended up at this restaurant because I was hoping to go somewhere else but it was never a mistake! Their mozzarella pizza and their ricotta pizza are both absolutely to die for! I would say this is hands down the best pizza I have had in the city of Pittsburgh. Their salad is just as phenomenal as the pizza and the cheese is so incredibly fresh! The service is pretty good, and friendly as well. The price tag approx $ 12-$16 a pizza is pretty intimidating but I've comfortably shared a pizza with another person both times (I did regret it though, based on taste, I did want my own). Parking is as convenient as you could hope for the area, there is a decent amount of seating and I've never encountered a wait even at prime dinner times. Certainly a place that your taste buds will thank you for investing in."}
{"text":"Cool restaurant! Great that it's BYOB, $2.50 per person though. I'm pretty picky when it comes to Italian pizza. I think the ingredients they used were fresh and flavorful. The soppressata was delicious and the spicy honey added a nice kick. I would suggest making the pizzas larger since the crust is so thin, the middle of the pizza was barely cooked and fell apart as soon as we picked it up. This is the closest to authentic Italian pizza that I've found yet in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. Once in a party of 4 and once in a party of 10. The food is really good. I love the pizzas, salad and HOT HONEY!!! It's a BYOB, charging for each glass ($2.50??). I do think that the menu is fairly limited. We are mostly vegetarian and were able to alter some of the pizzas. But, going there and spending $16 for a medium size fired pizza, I would like to see specials or a little more variety in the options. As much as we like it-and it is definitely great; without a lot of options, we won't be there very often. Definitely worth the try-let me know what you think!"}
{"text":"Great brick oven pizza. Attentive service! Not kid friendly from my perspective but that's just me and takes nothing from the quality!"}
{"text":"Food is exceptional.  If you are picking up double the time they tell you.  Has happened to me 5x."}
{"text":"Unbelievable taste and so fresh. Starter of the salad which was perfect mix w fresh mozzarella and tasty balsamic.  Share a Greenpointer which was perfect!"}
{"text":"The first time I went there it was pretty good, but I got the classic cheese with a couple of toppings.  The next time I went, there were three of us and all got specialty pizzas and none of them were very good.  I will have to try the classic cheese again.  It had the right amount of toppings and cheese.  I may update this later if I feel like going back.  Keep in mind the pizza in Pittsburgh isn't very good on a national level at all."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were in the area and looking for something quick to take home for dinner, so I immediately thought of Pizza Taglio. 2 pizzas= $37. That's a lot. I guess I didn't realize how incredibly expensive this place is when I came before, since I split the bill with two other girls. The pizzas were good, as they were last time, however- they didn't cut the slices for me. Meaning, that when I brought these back home to the South side of Pittsburgh, they had cooled and were difficult to slice. Luckily I own a pizza cutter and was able to cut it, but it took a while. The pizzas also looked ridiculous in the normal size pizza boxes- they looked so tiny. The flavors of these pies are still really good, but I caution you that they are overpriced and may not slice the pies for you if you get them to go."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza spot in Pittsburgh! The pizza is phenomenal and the service is wonderful! The green pointer pizza is by far the best pizza on the menu. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"As a pizza lover I can honestly say the food here is great. After just spending some time in Rome I have to admit this rivals the best pizza there. The staff was very nice and helpful even tho they were only soft open."}
{"text":"Very disappointing...not for the pizza although it tends to be soggy in the middle.  When I called to make reservations, I was told that it's first come first serve (I'm okay with that) and to be there at 7:00 PM on a Friday night.  I was assured that there would not be any wait.  Well, 30 minutes later, no table to be had!  Other customers also said that they were told to arrive at 7:00 PM as well.  No excuse for this!  I don't appreciate being duped!"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best pizza in Pittsburgh. You walk into the cozy space and are greeted by a hand made wood fired oven direct from the motherland, which clearly demonstrates that no corners are cut or shortcuts taken in this church of Roman style pizza. Tony, the chef and proprietor, is a learned master in the art of pizza making. His passion and love for his craft are infectious, and it's always a pleasure to have a chat with him when he swings by your table. If you're lucky, you may catch some off-menu fresh house made mozzarella as an appetizer. We've lived in San Francisco and New York, and have had plenty of pizza at the great ones such as Keste and Tony's Pizza Napoletana. Pizza Taglio stands right beside them as one of the best pizzas you can get in this country."}
{"text":"I'm glad I finally got a chance to come to this great neighborhood spot! We came around 6:30 on a Friday night and were seated right away. At that point in the evening, it seemed to be mostly incredibly hip looking young families with kids. By the time we left, there seemed to be a wait.   My husband and I split the arugula salad and the Green Point pizza. Both were delicious, but shortly after a second pizza appeared at our table! Apparently they had just gotten a new oven and our first pizza was deemed \"misshapen\" and we were comped a second pizza! We totally intended to take the second one home, but um, just ended up eating the whole thing. I'm definitely looking forward to making my way through their menu- probably with the optional Mikes Hot Honey on all of them, so good!  We had a great time here. It was very relaxed and staff was very friendly. I wish they didn't have a $5/person corkage fee- it might make me think twice about bringing a group here- but I guess that's pretty standard for BYOBs around here."}
{"text":"I was really impressed with the pizza at Pizza Taglio. Dare I say I think they're better than Dinette around the corner?! But based off my first experience @ Pizza Taglio I would say they are much better. Their menu is pretty simple, no appetizers or salads, just pizza. The selection is broken up into white and red pizzas, and you have about six different pizza choices for each. There's only a couple vegetarian pizza choices, but really any pizza can be made vegetarian if you eliminate the meat. My husband and I split 2 pizzas, the cauliflower & speck mato without the speck (so it was vegetarian). Both pizzas were amazing! So much flavor! I liked the cauliflower just slightly more. The Mikes Hot Honey was a nice touch.  Their prices are really good for the size of pizza you get. The pizzas are pretty decent size for one person, chances are you'll be able to bring some home. Service was great, everybody very friendly.  Can't wait to go back and try some more pizzas. Pizza Taglio is a must try ASAP!"}
{"text":"Tony is a master pizza maker! We tried appetizer, four pizzas, and dessert. All were exceptional. The hot honey on the pizza was a revelation. I can wait to come back and try more pizzas in the future. Thanks for wonderful food and a great dinner."}
{"text":"What more can you say? It's just delicious, simple, fresh ingredients done right! So good. I wish it was a tiny bit less expensive, but overall still deserving of 5 stars."}
{"text":"Go here!   I have walked past this place a bunch of times thinking it was \"yet another fancy pizza joint\".  Boy, was I wrong.  The place has a great feel to it, with a friendly and knowledgeable staff and a welcoming attitude.  We brought several bottles of wine and settled in to try some stuff out.  The owner, Tony, clearly loves what he is doing and it shows in the food and the atmosphere.    We started with the cheese and meat plate and the house-made ricotta.  The ricotta was the star of the evening...soft and luscious with just the right amount of bread that was charred in the huge wood fired oven.   Highly recommend.     We also sampled the Greenpointer (made with sweet sopressata instead of spicy for the spice wimp in our group), the Waypointer, and the Ricotta pizzas.   I'd be hard pressed to pick a favorite, as all of them were really good in their own ways.  I'll be back to try the Greenpointer as it is intended, since I think the hot honey, spicy sopressata combo is going to be a big winner.   The Waypointer had a great mix of flavors with the caramelized onions and a spicy sausage.  The Ricotta featured two kinds of cheese and some fresh local cherry tomatoes.  It was dressed with basil and was very fresh tasting.      Overall, a great evening and I'd absolutely go back."}
{"text":"Pizza Taglio has amazing, thin-crust pizza.  The carbonara pizza, with a bright orange-yolked fresh egg on top, was a real highlight and tasted exactly like a bowl of spaghetti carbonara, even though it was a pizza.  Alchemy, I say.  We also had the Greenpointer, with spicy soppresata and honey, which was a perfect combination of sweetness and heat.    A lot of other reviews mention Dinette which is close by.  Having been to both, my advice is to bypass Dinette and go straight to Pizza Taglio.   Make sure to remember your wine - it's BYOB."}
{"text":"Pizza done very well with a casual, friendly vibe. I love their Ricotta pie. Flavorful without being overbearing. While dining there with our group, the owner made us try his Carbonara pizza and it was sinfully amazing! Perfect blend of creamy cheese, smoky meat, and the oven cooked sunny side up eggs were the perfect addition."}
{"text":"Best new restaurant in East Liberty! Definitely a must!  The prices are reasonable and the pizza is delicious! Specifically you need to try the honey pizza and the white pizza with arugula! Both are cooked perfectly!  You MUST get the Nutella calzone for dessert! I thought the chocolate covered churro at Morcilla was the best dessert in Pittsburgh, but this Nutella creation is extremely delicious!  While the pizza does take awhile to come out, it comes out to perfection. It also helps that is BYOB and the staff is extremely friendly! I went with 8 people last night for a friend's birthday. Everyone was stuffed and more than satisfied! Great job Heather (server) and the chefs!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Pizza Taglio has my vote for the best pizza I've had in Pittsburgh thus far! The crust was absolutely delicious--thin, crispy and flavorful. You can't go wrong with the red or white bases. The classic margherita keeps you coming back for another slice, while the ricotta pie brings a creaminess paired with peppery fresh arugula. Ample choices for vegetarians and meat-eaters alike. A must try if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"They went to the trouble of making their pizza dough with bottled water during the boil advisory because they knew a day without their pizza would be a sad one. You transport to Italy with the first bite of any of their delicious pies. Favorite pizza place hands down"}
{"text":"Pizza taglio is my husband and I's go to dinner spot. The best wood fired pizza Pittsburgh and it's the only thing comparable (if not better) than pizza I've had in Italy. The hand pulled mozzarella on the pizza is a cheese lovers dream come true. Also, add the jidori egg yolk to your pizza. You're welcome.   Tony, the owner, makes everyone feel like family. If you haven't been yet, you should probably go for dinner tonight."}
{"text":"I was really excited for this place to open so close to my house. Unfortunately the pizza was as unsatisfying as the service. No thanks- stick with Il Pizzaiolo. The only positive thing about my experience was the wine I brought."}
{"text":"We went to Pizza Taglio two weeks ago and were really impressed with the pizza. We got the Adios Anoia and May the Swartz Be With You pizzas. The crust was wonderful - a little chewy but still crisp on the bottom of the pie. I was not impressed with the arugula salad, since the balsamic drizzle was a little too heavy and syrupy, but for the pizza, I give them 5 stars."}
{"text":"I want to give it 4.5 stars, but that's not an option. Sorry, Taglio.  Stopped in last night for the first time ever, tempted by the restaurant week special. Ordinarily I feel like $14 is a little much for pizza, but 2/$20 was just about right to get me to give it a chance. Also, it'  The wait was 45 minutes for a table for 4, but I suppose that's to be expected during restaurant week. We waited at the Livermore, which was considerably less crowded.  The wait staff was friendly and really helpful to me in navigating the menu to find vegetarian options. There are several, and they can do almost all the other pizzas without meat, if you're into that. I ordered the cauliflower pizza because it was intriguing and seasonal.  It was SO GOOD. I loved it! The white base has just the right amount of roasted garlic, and the cauliflower is cooked perfectly (I was worried it might come out undercooked). The crust is perfectly chewy - I'm a big fan. The pizza did take about 25 minutes to come out, which I think is typical for a place like this. Taken together with the long wait for a table, we were pretty much starving when our food finally came.  Would I return? Yes, if I'm craving high-end pizza and don't mind the potential wait."}
{"text":"Love this place. Me and the gf have been here multiple times together. You can BYOB so you can grab a bottle of wine on the way! The pizza here is awesome. Gourmet, if you will..."}
{"text":"What a gem!!! Authentic Roman-style pizza along with amazing appetizers. BYOB and the atmosphere is relaxing, just like Rome where you can sit and linger and enjoy. We had the arugula with tomato and mozzarella which was wonderfully fresh. Then we had cauliflower appetizer which was also very savory. 4 pizzas later, we were swimming in happiness. The Margherita pizza has an unbelievable sauce, and the Reds with meat are delicious. We also tried a white pizza with arugula and ricotta. Dessert included ricotta with honey and vanilla ice cream with marinated cherries. Felt just like Roma!!!! We will be back again and again. Tony is about to install the wood fired oven, which will only make his carefully created dishes extra yummy."}
{"text":"Simple ingredients, but fresh & very flavorful. Fast and friendly service. Try the Waymonious with added pistachios... so much goodness in every bite."}
{"text":"I stopped by on Thurs. evening around 7:30 with a friend for dinner.  I'd been wanting to try Pizza Taglio for awhile.  Given that my friend lives and works nearby, it seemed like a natural choice for a casual-yet-nice dinner to thank her for taking care of my cat over the holidays.  We started off with the arugula salad ($12), which consists of the titular vegetable plus grape tomatoes and fresh mozzarella balls drizzled with balsamic vinegar.  All of the ingredients were fresh and tasted good.  As would be expected given the ingredients, it was reminiscent of caprese salad, but was more similar in composition to a regular salad.  The size was large enough to share, as indicated on the menu.  For our main course, we decided to go with the Jackie pizza ($14).  This is a white pizza with a cheese base (forget which cheese--apologies), cremini mushrooms, and prosciutto.  We opted to get it with the optional duck egg on top (+$1), which was a great choice.  Although the pizza is flavorful enough to stand on its own, the broken egg yolk adds an extra dimension of creaminess and richness that complements the other ingredients nicely.  Overall, we were pleased with our meal at Pizza Taglio.  We didn't bring booze (my friend was driving), but the people at most of the other tables did, given that it's BYOB.  Service wasn't the most attentive, but was fine when we needed it, and our waitress was able to describe items and offer recommendations.  One thing to be aware of is that the pizza isn't super huge (about 14\" or so in diameter), and only contains 6 slices, so I recommend getting an appetizer/salad or a second pie if you're hungry."}
{"text":"My favorite place to get pizza in Pittsburgh! Great service, quality ingredients and fun relaxed atmosphere! I would recommend to try the Greenpointer and Jackie (with egg!) Amazing! Appetizers are really delicious as well!"}
{"text":"Pizza Taglio is seriously something special. So different than the other pizza shops in town, I cannot actually put them in the same category.   It is a smaller restaurant, with intimate seating and really interesting decor. In the back corner there is an enormous oven. The menu is short and sweet, and changes pretty frequently. One thing I must point out is the fresh ingredients used. Good quality, homemade everything, and not at all greasy. It is as close to real Italian pizza as you can get.   I recently ordered a margarita pizza and a white ricotta pizza. It is a thin crust, with a harder, large end crust piece. It maintains it's chewiness throughout. The cheese is not overbearing and a good ratio with the sauce.   Now I must say it: the best thing to put on your pizza is the hot honey. Sweet with a little kick, it is absolutely incredible and really brings out the best in the pizza. I look forward to it every time I visit and it goes well with every pizza I have put it on thus far."}
{"text":"Delicious food! I love the simple menu and BYOB option. A fun spot with great food in East Liberty!   I was pleasantly surprised to be seated right away on a Friday night and the service was really good.  Street parking available for pay before 6 pm."}
{"text":"I will couch everything here with the caveat that this place just opened and may still be figuring things out. First- the pros: the pizza is inventive and delicious! Definitely try the Greenpointer, the added honey is unexpected and fantastic! It was even good the next day reheated for lunch. The front opens to the street, which is always welcome on warm evenings. The cons: the menu is basically just pizza. No salads, etc. The wait staff were actually too attentive, believe it or not. The place was only about 1/3 full the evening we were there. Every 5 min one of 2 waiters would come by to ask how we were doing, did we need something, are we ready to order, it was annoying! Also what's with waiters asking if you want your water refilled? Please don't interrupt our dinner conversation to ask about tap water- just refill it! But this issue may just be a pet peeve of mine. Because of this over attentiveness we were rushed through our meal too quickly to enjoy. We paused from eating briefly to talk and BAM! Waiter at the table to ask if we wanted to box up the rest. No thanks, we JUST got the food. The place also needs a sound system so they aren't blasting music from a jambox on the pizza counter so anyone seated nearby is deafened. All of this is to say that I still give it 4 stars because the food tasted great and I was excited to eat my leftovers the next day. How it holds up against Dinette which has a similar menu and is just around the corner (with better waitstaff) is yet to be seen."}
{"text":"First off lets say BYOB and pizza are my 2 favorite things in the world. Literally. I have been wanting to go here for some wood fired pizza for a while. Place is small but cute for a small pizza shop. Our server was very nice and very attentive (we went on a Wednesday so it wasn't very crowded).   What we ordered: We got the Pino and the Jackie with egg. Whatever you do, GET THE JACKIE. It was incredible! The Pino was decent but I probably wouldn't get it again. It was a little soggy crust wise but I did enjoy the flavors.   We wanted to try the hot honey because we weren't getting any pizza with it on, so we ordered a side of it and definitely enjoyed dipping some of our pizza in it. IT IS SPICY THOUGH!   They are a bit pricey for some za, I think each one cost us $15. Not horrible by any means especially for the ingredients, just wish they were a bit larger for the money. Other than that I'll definitely be back to try one with the hot honey!"}
{"text":"This is the most ridiculously good pizza. I dream about my current favorite, the Jackie - prosciutto, crimini mushrooms and truffle cream.   Pro tip - order off menu, get Johnnie Boombatz (five cheese white pizza with mortadella)."}
{"text":"Yet another perfect pizza from Tony @ Taglio. Today we had one with really good hot sausage, red bell peppers, and chili oil. So good. And then espresso to top it off. You have to try the espresso, which is a special blend Tony gets from Zeke's. It may be the best espresso in town. It's definitely the best pizza in town."}
{"text":"What a great idea. Menu items include pizza, pizza and pizza! BYOB. Simple and delicious because when you stay focused you can perfect the craft. Margherita pizza was superb.... The guys shared one with sausage and honey. Not a crumb left on the plate! Nice casual atmosphere... We will go back"}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza in the city and always friendly service. BYOB is always a plus to."}
{"text":"Bottom line: Really yummy pizza that's a tad on the pricey side! This place is BYOB!  My friends and I found ourselves here on a Saturday night. Unfortunately around 8pm, the wait was about an hour. Luckily we satisfied ourselves by getting margaritas across the street at Patron. When we were finally seated an hour later we realized the restaurant was BYOB. We quickly placed our orders and all four of us ran four different directions-me to grab wine from my apartment which was around the corner and my friends to the wine and spirits store across the street. I'm incredibly grateful for the waitstaff for not judging us! Our food was served to us upon our arrival pipping hot. The pizzas are unique and flavorful. We thoroughly enjoyed our food and the ambiance."}
{"text":"Adorable little pizza joint in the Shadyside/Bloomfield area. Cute, somewhat authentic and hipster ambiance, with pizzas made right in front of you. Keep in mind that this is a little upscale, $12-16 for a 15-inch, generally light pizza. BYOB, so bring a nice wine to pair with it.    Pros: nice, open atmosphere. Good service, Giuseppe was very friendly. I got a Carbonara pizza, which I can't recall exactly the kind of meat which was on it, but had no tomato sauce, an egg yolk, some really good cheese and some Italian meat similar to bacon. The chef offered to add more yolks if I desired, which I later asked for. So, authentic, unique Italian food, to say the least.   Cons: They only serve pizza, which makes sense. But nothing else. I heard that they possibly serve cannolis other days. Hipster atmosphere. Expensive price for a pizza. If you observe kosher or halal rules, I'd be wary of this place...halal especially, the only meats they serve are pig ones, it seems. So expect to be surprised, don't look for something like your average Papa John's or Dominoes."}
{"text":"The menu to this restaurant is short and sweet. The food was amazing. I got the Margherita pizza and the mixed greens salad with arugula, tomatoes, and balsamic. The hot honey is a must to get! Dipping your crust in the honey was the BEST. The restaurant was cozy and the tables were all full. The BYOB was a huge plus, too!"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon Taglio whilst taking a brisk jaunt through East Liberty. It was sunny, and the oversized from window was propped open exposing the inside of the restaurant. Inside, the cook (pizza God) looked over and gave me a smile. I had a good feeling about this place. i stopped what I was doing and went with my intuition. I was greeted by a very calm, informative waitress. I ordered a latte, and a single pizza for myself. The latte came out in great timing, not too quickly which told me they took great care in preparing it. It was perfect. Upon finishing my caffeinated beverage, the holy grail, my pizza, arrived. I have never had something so delectable in my face. I ate the WHOLE pie in one sitting, and didn't feel one bit of remorse. The ingredients were fresh, I even added a few new tastes to my palate that day. Overall, service was great. Location, fabulous. Food so undeniably good that when you leave you get kind of sad knowing that you've just reached the peak of your day. Taglio is my religion."}
{"text":"I had heard excellent reviews of Pizza Taglio and had been dying to go. With a spur of the moment decision yesterday I was finally was able to make it there for lunch. I'm a pizza lover in general but their Ricotta Pie was the perfect mix of cheesy goodness and fresh ingredients with arugula and roasted tomatoes topping it.   Glad I can now add Pizza Taglio as a new go to for me."}
{"text":"A great place for a relaxed evening. Really liked their Ricotta Pie! The service was amazing too."}
{"text":"We get pickup from here nearly once a month, so it's about time I review it! I've eaten in a few times, too, but service is nothing to write home about. The zucchini pizza (Adios Anoia), on the other hand...sometimes we get two just to eat one for dinner, and eat one for breakfast with a few eggs baked on top. We're a fan of several of the red pizzas as well, but somehow, this vegetarian pizza is what truly makes our (carnivore) hearts sing! If you get a pizza with the hot honey, and you're getting it to go, ask them to leave it uncut--the honey tends to run out onto the cardboard, and then you're missing out on half of the deliciousness.  The downsides--it's not cheap, but it's \"gourmet\" pizza so you probably weren't expecting $5 pies. Also, they've been charring their pizzas a bit more lately, to the point of some unpleasant bitterness on the edge of the crust. If you are getting pickup, I recommend calling substantially (like an hour) ahead of time--they get surprisingly backed up, even on weeknights. I guess the word is out!"}
{"text":"Absolutely blissfully delicious pizza! Reminds me of Cheeseboard (my favorite pizza place) in Berkeley, CA. This place won't stay a scret for long :)"}
{"text":"There's a spot within the block around my building that I enjoy! It's a pizza miracle.  +1 and I ran over here on a rainy weekday as we've been meaning to come over since they opened. I'm typically a little sketchy about places that I'm unsure of how they operate. Is it table service? Yes. Can you come in and get a whole pie to go? Yes .. Well, maybe--I tried to do this Saturday night and was turned away (in the nicest, \"I can ask Tony!\" kind of way) because of a short supply of dough--call ahead.  At least this past week, immediately, we were greeted and told to sit wherever. This super friendly staff member let us know it is BYOB so you are damn right I ran back across the street in the rain to grab a bottle. She also explained the menu of few white pizza, a few reds, and how most people eat at least half a pie. I already knew I was getting my own. Amateurs.  I naturally had the ricotta pie. White sauce on some serious dough, crushed cherry tomatoes, piles of ricotta, and topped with black pepper and arugla. Woof. Right? I'm gonna go broke with this being across the street and thirteen a pie. +1 had the ever popular Greenpointe which included some huge slices of spicy sopressa (or maybe soppressata?) and that hot honey over red and mozzarella.  I, eating around the sausage, even liked it. They were perfect, if a bit underdone in the middle for a few (but seriously, just the way I would want them). The service stayed great, although a tiny bit hovering.  At least three staff members and Mr. Giamarita came by to make sure everything was done well.  We genuinely had a great time (with our entire bottle of wine gone).  Please make note this is \"Roman\" style pizza.  They're cooked longer, giving that crispy outside with everything melted and ready to go in the middle. This means you won't get the flat grease by the slice you're used to and it's going to take a bit more time.  Patience (and pizza!) is virtue."}
{"text":"Pizza was delicious. I had the featured pizza with lamb sausage, eggplant and buffalo ricotta salata and it was probably the best \"non traditional\" pizza I've ever had. Service was great, the water was always filled to the very top, just as it should be. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Probably the best Neapolitan pizza in United States. I'm taking about the crust.  Beats Il Pizziola. Pure perfection, but in all fairness that's all they make. BYOB by the way. Liquor store around the corner."}
{"text":"I'm pretty conflicted about this place. The crust is amazing. By far by MILES the best crust I've ever had in Pittsburgh and prob the best crust of my entire life. And I've tried a lot of different pizza places. But we had some issues with my pizza.  When we called to order they were out of speck, so we got guanciale instead. We went by the menu on their website. Ordered the ricotta pie which is supposed to have ricotta, mozzarella, cherry tomatoes, and arugula. I asked for no tomatoes and added guanciale, they were fine with substitutions which we were happy about. The pizza I received had ricotta, mozz, GARLIC, basil.... and no arugula. When we called back about this (if you're spending $35 or 40 on two small pizzas I would really expect them to be perfect.. not a lot to ask at these prices) they said they're actually out of arugula.  I wish they had told us this when we had originally placed the order. Or at least called back to let us know. I'm pregnant and like the only reason I got that particular pizza was BECAUSE of the arugula. Also during the call back we are told that the menu on their own website is apparently not updated. Uhh. So like they just add 5 pieces of basil on a pizza that's supposed to have arugula. And garlic is listed on two of the OTHER pizzas, but the pizza I ordered definitely was not supposed to have garlic. If only I had known that it was my job to make extra sure that they wouldn't put on an ingredient (two, really) that I hadn't been expecting in the first place.  So all in all, a place that charges $15 plus tax for each pizza honestly NEEDS to be detail-oriented and be on top of their shit! Their website should be updated and accurate! They should have all their ingredients in stock on a Saturday evening! They should PAY ATTENTION to each individual order.. read the tickets.. read them two or three times if that's what you need to do.. this was just really disappointing from a place that I wanted to make our new regular pizza place. One other negative is the menu literally consists of certain topping combos, 4 red pizzas and 4 white ones so slim pickins, especially when they don't even have the ingredients for all of them! The crust is really, really, really good though. And they did offer to make a new pizza but still without arugula. :("}
{"text":"The crew preparing this pizza took lots of care and you can see with the open kitchen. Green pointer was lights out. This was my first time, definitely not my last. I love the local pizza scene but this quickly rose amongst the top."}
{"text":"I so wanted this place to be good. A great wood fired pizza place within walking distance of my home....perfect. Alas not to be so. They dont seem to understand their oven yet. The pizzas came under out under done after a really long wait. Either oven temp too low or they are pulling them out too soon. All ingredients seemed ok but execution was lacking. Hopefully it will improve over time."}
{"text":"Updating to a five. This place is easily the best pizza in the city and I have had nothing but exceptional service every time I have been there (which has been A LOT). This is my first place to recommend to anyone who is looking for somewhere to eat. I have taken so many people here and everyone agrees - it is amazing!"}
{"text":"I ordered the margherita pizza and it was absolutely delicious and perfectly done! Just as good as the pizza I had when I was in Rome! Super friendly and fast service as well! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We ate there last night our table tried three different pizzas. All exceeded our expectations and can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"The staff is disorganized. The rude man with the red beard at the counter was too busy with a personal call to take my order for about 5 minutes.  There was no menu \"they're not printed yet\". I thought they only had pizza since that was all that was listed on the blackboard -6 varieties, but it appeared they had other choices. The rest room (unlabeled) is down the hall but if you go there u get locked out. I had the asparagus pizza which was delicious. The staff seems to be trying really hard so maybe with time things will run smoother. I was entertained throughout my meal by the black spider crawling up and down the counter & on the coffee grinder.  This was the reason I passed on the delicious looking chocolate cake, sliced but uncovered on a plate next to the coffee grinder."}
{"text":"One of the hip new places in Pittsburgh attracts another winner.  Pizza Taglio takes on a bloated market in the city, but hones in on something we lack.  Simple, well executed, wood-fired pizzas.  More on the pizza in a moment. The wife, daughter, and myself circled the East Liberty area scouring for a parking spot.  After 5-10 minutes I surrendered and dropped them out front and \"illegally\" parked in the Whole Foods, Petco, CVS lot across the street.  With so many places to eat at parking will be problematic for Pizza Taglio and it's neighboring restaurants. I entered the small 20ish seater eatery and could instantly smell burning wood, fresh dough, and a faint linger of smoke.  Friendly greetings soon followed as I walked towards my girls.  They were already sipping drinks and reading the menu.  We were instructed that two pizzas should feed the the 2 1/2 of us so we ordered the New Ricotta Pie and the Greenpointer (thanks Yelpers!).   My daughter was interested in watching them make and bake the pizzas and because of where we were sitting she stood on my lap and watched intently.  The workers behind the counter talked to her and encouraged the curiosity.   Our pizzas arrived in about 10 minutes and we were welcomed with two beautiful pies.  My daughter loved the ricotta pie, despite being a somewhat picky eater.  My wife was craving \"thin crust, wood fired pizza\" and she was pleased.  I devoured a slice of the ricotta first knowing that my girls would gravitate towards it so I'd better get gnashing.  The ricotta was silky and rich, the blistered tomatoes were fresh and popped with additional flavor.  The crust....yes exactly what I had hoped for -- Crisp edges, not too thin, yet not a pillow with plenty of air pockets and chew.  The Greenpointer was the star for me however.  The red sauce was not over done and not sweet, the sweetness was obtained with the hot honey.  Then the spicy Sopresseta....yep, that set it off.   I give this 4 stars because we ate 2 pizzas and a dessert and paid a little of $40 bucks.  I get that its going to be more expensive, but that's pushing my boundaries to visit often.  The parking was annoying and if I could I'd give them 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"Nice new restaurant.  Friendly service.  Now for the food...really tasty with a crisp crust and with spicy sopressata and Mike's Hot honey, nice combo of flavors. Stop by and try some of the creative pizza's with fresh ingredients, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great pies. We had one red and one white and they were both delicious. I'm used to Neapolitan style, this is Roman style, the crust is a little thicker and I have to say the crust was really tasty, to me essential for really great pizza. These folks get it right. BYOB, and there's a wine store a block away."}
{"text":"Dat Greenpointer pizza doe.  I had heard good things about Pizza Taglio for awhile and kept walking past it on my way to other great eats on this street, but my cravings for all different types of food usually trumps my cravings for pizza, so it took me more time than it should've to make it here.  Finally suggested it to a couple of friends, and so glad I did! The Wednesday evening we went, the place felt a little empty, a little too quiet, but I've walked past before on weekend nights and it looks cozy and bustling from the outside.  We started with an arugula salad -- not much to say about it, exactly what you would expect from the ingredients, nothing out of the ordinary but it's a solid salad.  The pizza, on the other hand, was amazing! We ordered the Greenpointer based on Yelp reviews. It was absolutely scrumptious and addictive. The crust is great, the red sauce is great, the soppressata is savory and crispy, but what gives the dish its uniquely addictive flavor is that Hot honey people keep talking about. It kicks up the spice just a little and mellows it out with its sweetness.  That's one memorable pizza. I will be back!"}
{"text":"We were really excited when this place opened up and finally had the chance to check it out.  We were one of two tables seated and it took over 40+ min to get our pizzas.  The waitress was very nice and said they would be on the house because of the wait.  We thought that was very nice. I got a white pizza with ricotta and arugula and the H got red with sausage. They were both good although some of the arugula on my pie was soggy and turning slime like when it sits too long in the bottom of a produce bag. No biggie. Easily removed.  We each loaded up on red chili flakes for some kick.  The check arrived and nothing was comped.  I felt too awkward to bring it up or make a scene.  Oh well."}
{"text":"I am so happy I finally went to Pizza Taglio. I had been looking for a place that had creative pizzas AND good crust in the area and this is it.  There was a wait (it was about 7:00pm on a Saturday, so that was to be expected. My boyfriend and I put our names in and then we went next door to have a drink at The Livermore while we waited. The wait was only half the time we were quoted. Woo hoo!  To start, the ambiance is, well, lacking. I feel like it's a bit drab inside. It gives me the impression they took the style of pizza by the slice kind of place and turned the lights down to make it \"hip\". I think with a few minor stylistic changes, this place could go to the next level, while still keeping with the casual, low-key vibe. I was also a bit disappointed that they have a deli counter set up in the middle of the restaurant and it is pretty messy and fully on display to the restaurant. I think this could have been a really cool way of giving the diners a hit of what goes into making some of the dishes (like having an open kitchen would), but instead I just wanted to keep from looking at it because it was distracting (and not so good way).  DRINKS This place is BYOB. I believe it was $5/person.  FOOD To eat we had the following:  - Antipasto Plate - Greenpointer pizza - Bob Malnati pizza  The antipasto plate was good and I may order it again if I'm in the mood for some sliced meats. The chunks of pecorino were pretty small, but for two people it was satisfying. The pizzas were both very good! I kept trying to figure out which I liked better, and honestly it might have been the Bob Malnati. I lived in Greenpoint for a bit, so perhaps I'm partial to Paulie Gee's version of Taglio's Greenpointer, the Hellboy.  OVERALL I will absolutely come back and often. Long wait? Who cares when there is a lovely little bar next door. Good pizza, BYOB, and good value. Go! You won't be disappointed, at least not if you sit away from the deli counter ;)"}
{"text":"Wonderful service from the waitress, BYOB, great open window looking onto the street. Lots of different pizzas to choose from; my table chose 2 and both were delicious!  There is only pizza on the menu. The pizza crust was perfect. I'm happy I tried this pizza joint and will definitely be back soon! It helps the wine store is across the street:)"}
{"text":"I'm going with 4 stars because I don't think I was able to take advantage of everything this restaurant has to offer. But overall, I had a good experience.   I came in one night to order a carry-out pie. It wasn't busy at all and they got started on my pizza as soon as I ordered. I forgot the name of it, but it was the one with an egg on it and I added sausage. My only two criticisms are the price relative to the size of the pizza, and the fact that it got cold really quickly. I'm certainly not an authentic Italian pizza connoisseur, but it was great! The most memorable part was that the crust was baked to a perfect crunchiness. The cheese was perfectly melted; it was a simple and very satisfying meal.   I really like that you can see the kitchen area where they bake the pizzas. Everyone who worked there seemed to be enjoying themselves, which I think created a friendly atmosphere. I'd definitely try it again."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night. Simple, fresh ingredients, good pizza. We ordered the Margherita, Green-pointer and New Ricotta Pie.Friendly service, even as they started to get busy. The ambiance is lack luster and the logo painted on the wall is just terrible. Would I go back? Yes"}
{"text":"Delicious brick oven pizza! Great atmosphere, small but big enough to bring 4 or more people without feeling overcrowded. Pizza options are endless from red to white. BYOB also a plus at $2.50 per person. This place  could be one of the better spots in the city for brick oven pizza."}
{"text":"Pizza taglio is hands down my favorite pizza place in the US. It's the closest you can come to real Italian pizza. I always end up getting the same pizza - greenpointer with sopresatta and mike's hot honey. I'm also a YUGE fan of their ricotta pizzas. I believe their ricotta is homemade and tastes fantastic."}
{"text":"Taglio is one of my favorite Pizza places in town. I'm quite the sucker for wood fired european-style pizzas with a delicious thin crust and fresh ingredients.  I've been coming here for some time now, and every visit the Pizza has just gotten better. Though, admittedly I'm a bit sad to see \"The Jackie\" is no longer on the menu - it was one of my favorites!  Bring a bottle (or box) of wine and enjoy some real pizza!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is high quality and very artisan. Go with an open mind as to what you want on your pie...you can always get the standard (which is delicious) but why stick with sauce and cheese when you get get spicy honey??  Make sure to note, this is a byob"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in Pittsburgh, hands down. It's unique, and absolutely delicious Roman style. The crust is mouth watering and the toppings are exquisite. Whomever wrote the review about the bee pollen in the pizza doesn't know what they're talking about. Bee pollen and honey are two different things. If people don't go to this place immediately to eat pizza, it is their loss. And the service is incredible too."}
{"text":"One of the best pizza places in Pittsburgh. I love love their zucchini pizza and their green pointer. I cannot even decide which one is better, they're both so delicious! I am normally not a pizza person, but oh Boy I can eat these everyday.  I ordered carry out and it was ready pretty fast. I was thinking about ordering domino pizza and with all the deals they have, I found the price isn't that much difference compare to pizza taglio. I would choose pizza taglio any day :) you will not regret it! I have to come back soon!"}
{"text":"Friends, Romans, Yinzers...lend me your ears. There's some fine wood-fired pizza pie to be had in \"S'Liberty.\" Choose from an eclectic mix of Red and White pizzas. The crust is characteristically Neopolitan though the center didn't quite hold up its end of the bargain. Order your own and be selfish or order a couple different types to share amongst your company. Oh and it's BYOB...bonus. It's no Fiori's, but it's in a class of its own and Caesar would be damn proud."}
