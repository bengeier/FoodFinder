{"text":"Horrible and spent a $100 playing and they still gave me a bill of $20 after I gave the bartender a $30 tip I dont know if they took my points off my card"}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out, very quiet  on a Fri night.  Beer was cold, bartender friendly and kept busy cleaning and not being noisy lol. Will deffentry be back.  Thanks"}
{"text":"A fine little music venue, though word has it that it's closed now. The guy who books and promotes for the place is real super cool, the bar has a decnt beer selection, the live sound is great, and the stage is pretty cool too.  Oh, and you can gamble on poker machines and whatnot if you wish.  Sorta off the beaten path, but good place to see a show.  UPDATE:  It's closed.  :("}
{"text":"I've been going to this location for over a year now, usually get the same bartenders, Kaleb and/or Patty. For some reason, tonight was a completely different story on the bar tab. I'm not a big player by any means, but I do play the ENTIRE time I'm there. I usually come with about 2-3 friends and we all order and gamble for HOURS! Tonight, I ordered 3 beers and a $3 order of tator tots.  I gambled for over 2 hours at the bar and WASN'T EVEN COMPED ONE BEER! NOT COOL!! No warning, just an \"F*#K You\" tab when I was ready to go. The excuse I got was, \"the manager controls things now and there's nothing I can do\". WOW! Really? You can't even comp me ONE beer for the time and money I have put into this place?!?   Me and my friends won't be coming back here EVER! A simple warning would have been nice, but to just keep serving us like you always do and then bring a ridiculous tab without a real explanation, NOT OK!   I cut up my player's card and will NOT be coming back!   Apparently, you shouldn't waste your time gambling here since they are not going to comp any drinks for you and guest service is not their priority! When $20 can't even get you ONE FREE beer, it's definitely time to move on!  Your loss Five Star!!!! I will take this as a hint to spend my money elsewhere! Peace Out!"}
{"text":"Our bartenders, Megan and Sherry, were SPECTACULAR!!!  This was our first visit and Megan was very helpful with the abundance of games.  The appetizers were delicious and our glasses never got below half full.  I give 5 Star, 5 STARS!!!!!   We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"New to the area, 2nd visit tonight, it's close to where I live, food is decent but tonight I got fleeced!  I ordered a Jameson on the rocks with dinner and when the bill comes the Jameson is billed as \"premium double\" for $12.00! I asked the server thinking for sure it was just billed wrong but no she said Jameson is a premium and that was a double. Well I didn't order a double and I sure as hell didn't receive a double!  It was a single with too much ice. They might have got me this time but I'll never go back!"}
{"text":"Where to start... this pains me to write a bad review but I must. Within 5 mins the machine ate my 20 bucks... that's literally never happened in my life. They can't do anything about it come back tomorrow. Uhh ok. I should break this machine bit I'm hungry. Order a grilled cheese, only a small order of fries comes with it tonight lol. Damnit oh well... now my buddy's breakfast sandwich comes out, no breakfast potatoes. I've been coming here a while and know it comes with potatoes or tator tots. I don't know man, it will probably be a while before I come back, I mean I will be back tomorrow to get my 20 the machine stole  but after that... nah I'll drive up to remedys. Place has always been a dive but I liked it. Now I dont. At all. Getting to cheap and machine ratting money. To me to find a new spot. Goodluck"}
{"text":"Not a bad little spot. The clubhouse sandwich I pretty good. Relaxed environment, good food and doesn't smell like smoke. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"It's bar food all the way. Was yummy. Service was slow and the room was filled cigarettes that is. Had the soup ad it was okay. My husband had a Ruben and it was greasy but delicious."}
{"text":"Not a whole lot to say here.  Bartender was rude and the food was bad, and I like  ar food, so believe me it was bad.  The cook on the other hand was friendly but that's about it."}
{"text":"Myself and three others had lunch today, food was very good. Room is to dam cold. I want be back till this summer and then they will have the heater on. Turn up the heat."}
{"text":"i remember hittin this place up for sunday skooliln... dope vibe, cool cats and fresh performances... i wouldve never found this place without my local connects, thats for sure... peace to the DZ kings..."}
{"text":"I don't get the bad reviews...great bar food!! Bartenders are friendly and was warmly greeted when I walked in!! They all make me feel welcomed!!"}
{"text":"Consistently terrible. Gave them four tries in last 6 months to try and make it worth the trip each time.    Being a gluten for punishment thinking it will be better next time but never is.    Tips for bar owners - I come to bar to relax and enjoy spending my money, you know paying your bills which some people forget is the purpose for offering services.  When I get ignored by all employees and get slow service for mediocre food and drinks (don't fool yourself i can get anywhere)... well you get the idea.   Afraid it's the last time."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite bar in Henderson due to the friendly staff and great food. Kory is one of the best bartenders in town! He's great at making drinks and is very up to date on current world events and sports.   If you want some eye candy go see Alissa and Amber.  Located in walking distance to a movie theatre. I would recommend cashing in on their happy hour and seeing a movie afterwards. I went there for breakfast one time and the friendly bartender, I think her name was Joyce, recommended steak and eggs.... Awesomeness!"}
{"text":"2 girls work together and watch your video poker machine and your every move. All conversations seem to be monitored. Cameras are everywhere and there is absolutely no privacy. Food was terrible. Video poker machines are some of the worst I have ever played. DO NOT GO AND WASTE YOUR $$$$$!! THERE ARE MUCH BETTER PLACES IN LAS VEGAS.  THIS PLACE IS ONLY INTERESTED IN TAKING YOUR MONEY!! WILL NEVER VISIT ANY 5 STAR TAVERNS AGAIN!!"}
{"text":"I am so disappointed with this restaurant in Sun City Summerlin.  Ist of all I am not fond of the help on Thurs. - plus they have no clue how to run a restaurant.  Bartenders are waiters and they are not friendly at all.  The food is good if you don't mind waiting 1.2 hour to figure out who is suppose to wait on you.  This was suppose to be an asset to sun city....NOT!  It is also, THurs. night and NO FOOTBALL - right!!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I went here on Saturday evening around 8 pm for dinner.  He ordered the steak and eggs and I ordered the steak dinner.  Service was pretty good, however we seemed to have to wait awhile for our food.  We were the only ones in the dining area.  The chef ended up bringing out our dinners.  While the food tasted good, mine was a bit on the cold side.  Steak was warm, but veggies and bread were straight up cold.  I think the waitress/bartender was busy, our food sat and the cook finally brought it out.  Anyway, overall good food, great coffee and we will be going back."}
{"text":"I love the food.  Some of the best bar food I've had. Drinks are good as well. Service is always prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"RUDE!! My husband and I walked in sat at the bar asked the bartender with red/orange  hair for a menu and asked her if we could eat at the bar and play video poker. She said yes and gave us a menu and then proceeded to IGNORE US!!! She walked past us a couple times and so did another employee (bald guy) . Never offered us a drink or took our order as we sat there putting money in the machines!! We are Sun City residents and will NEVER walk in there again! Straight B.S.!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great, ordered the slider sampler, and liked all of them. Although the winner of the night was the deep fried cheesecake...., I enjoyed a green tea shot and a Stella Artois beer with my bf. He had a few rolling rock beers. He also ordered the Philly cheesesteak with tater tots and it was pretty good  surprising hole in the wall place that I will definitely be visiting again"}
{"text":"George is my favorite! (= He has wonderful customer service skills, he knows how to make amazing drinks, and builds great relationships with his guests.  Love the food also."}
{"text":"This bar if perfect for a low key night, or to watch your Sunday football game (they have the NFL package!!!). The bar staff and cooks were great. Speedy service and friendly smiles. Even the poker machines seemed to favor the customer.   The food was awesome. There is a large selection of foods for all appetites. I had the Potato soup and a burger, that were both fantastic.   I'll be coming here again for sure!"}
{"text":"Excellent ambience! It was clean and quiet. I'm sure this place has a bad rep from the last place that was there...Kahootz? I almost did not go in because of the old bar. I am glad I did, the bartender was friendly. The food was decently priced, nothing much different about the food from any other bar. Would have gotten a 5 if the food was better or different atleast. I would definitely be back."}
{"text":"Bernie and Jeremy are my go-to guys! Jeremy is new and made a great impression from the get-go, not even knowing I was a regular! Bernie has been my main man for years. Drinks are great and the machines have been very nice to me!"}
{"text":"Went last night for dinner and it was great,Larry the chef bought our food out to us.That man can kill in the kitchen, don't take my word go try it. Food is great at a good price"}
{"text":"We love the bartenders, Jamie and Katie.  They are fantastic.  That is the only reason we go there.  Their bar food is good too.  The club sandwich, spaghetti and meatballs, hot dogs, and pork sliders are very good.  Pool table is in fairly good shape, and the televisions are nice and big.  I would have given them 5 stars, but we had issues at the other Five Star on North Rancho with the owners/managers being inattentive with customer service issues.  The same owners/managers run this Five Star too."}
{"text":"It makes me frustrated to give this review. We are Sun City residents within walking distance to Five Star. We also golf at Palm Valley regularly. The last two times we have gone to Five Star, we have sat down (menus are pre planted on the table) within view of two waitresses, and no one waited on us. We waited more than 20 minutes both times, didn't get water, a I'll be right with you, nothing. And no comment to either of us as we had to walk by them to leave. And won't go back. Our friends waited 25 minutes for pancakes on another occasion.  It is so disappointing to not be able to frequent a local establishment, especially one that is subsidized by residents of Sun City and we can walk to."}
{"text":"Recently stopped in for a beer and to gamble with my girlfriend. From the moment we walk in the bartenders were friendly. As soon as we sat down the bartender(short guy with jet black hair) approached us and got us drinks.  We started gaming and he suggested we should sign up for a card.  So my girlfriend signed up. Overall this was a great experience and we will be back a lot more often."}
{"text":"I first came here 2 months ago had the greatest customer service I had in a long time. I came back a second time I had the same bartender Cassandra, same thing great customer service. The next time I came in I had a different bartender and I told her about how great the customer service. She laughed and said I must have caught Cassandra on a good day, I didn't  appreciate her humor. Turns out they let Cassandra go. I have been in here 3 times now and the customer service is horrible I walked out waiting for someone to take my food order last time and it looks like I am going to do it again. Looks like they let the wrong bartender go. If you can live with poor customer service, the food is good here. I recommend the blue cheese burger or the blue cheese steak."}
{"text":"Walking into the 5 Star Tavern I was immediately comfortable.  I had fun on the games and the food was awesome! Definitely try this place."}
{"text":"Decided to try out a local tavern. Nice clean neighborhood type bar. Good TVs for game watching. Ventilation system not good at all, hit by massive smoke while entering. I stayed anyway to try the happy hour food. Ordered beef sliders and fries. Damn good. Drink was good too. Overall a great place to hang out if you don't mind smelling like smoke."}
{"text":"We walked today to get exercise and ended up at Five Star tavern and got something to eat.  The Best hamburger and onion rings were very good. The meat was cooked to perfection and the onion rings were nice and crisp. My honey had breakfast with hid eggs cooked just right. We will be back forvsure."}
{"text":"Just not a good place to go to. All these used to be but when there is no beer on tap and no food to buy there is something wrong."}
{"text":"I LOVE this BAR.  The bartenders are the BEST. The bar food  is good and the dinners are good. Breakfast  is served all hours the kitchen is open. I always find good slot machines to play. This is a fun place to go."}
{"text":"I'm gonna keep this short and sweet.   This is a great neighborhood bar. Crazy friendly bartenders  . Quick and easy to order food. Little snacks to munch on...   I'll be checking this place again to get on the happy hour."}
{"text":"This is a very pleasant tavern to go and watch some sports, have a few, and play a few games if you are interested.  The folks are very cheerful and attentive, without hovering. Nice place!!"}
{"text":"Got the Bleu Cheese Burger to go based on a Yelp review.  Burger was really good and the Tots were pretty delicious.  Will be going back again"}
{"text":"Lucky machines, breakfast was good and plenty  and Bloody Caesar was delish! Service was great and we'll be back again!"}
{"text":"We decided to give Five Star in SC a try and happy we did!  Great atmosphere on patio overlooking golf course.   Our server Sophia was very attentive.  Good menu and our meals -Shrimp Tacos, Philly Ch steak sandwich, and steak and eggs were tasty!  Happy Hour from 3-7 sounds great!  A big plus is the indoor restaurant is non- smoking !  Will definitely return"}
{"text":"This place is great. My wife and I often frequent here and enjoy the intimate atmosphere. The food is better than what you would expect from a normal bar.   My wife and I have tried their potato cheese soup as well as their chicken wings and chicken tenders and all I can say is they are way above the average bar food.   The staff is friendly and best of all its right down the street OHHH and they have a bitchen 2-7pm happy hour.....pretty sweet!"}
{"text":"i have lived down the street for years.  been stopping in on and off since it was called Quarters.  once 5 Star took over it has gone even further down hill.  the bartenders change every 3 months.  have run into a few good ones, but some are just terrible!!  if they didn't have golden tee I would never go back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The complementary food is very delicious. I really like their parmesian wings. The staff is also very friendly."}
{"text":"Five Star Tavern should deserve 10 stars- been several times... made special with bartenders like Kory who knows drink, and sports paired with exceptional service. Good employees make the business"}
{"text":"Tracy, the main bartender that takes care of me is awesome! 5 star tavern definitely deserves their name! I super enjoy the service and how heavy they pour the drinks!  I'd be really impressed if they actually had a day where beer was free.... just playing =)  The stuff that goes down here is sometimes questionable but fun non the less!"}
{"text":"Five stars for Five Star!  This is our favorite little place  for some good cocktails and decent bar food. Sliders are great and service is excellent!  They comp well too if you are playing enough and tip well..  Keep up the good work!  Thx"}
{"text":"Had a great time here!! Tracy is a white guy that can make a MEAN michelada! I wish I would've watched him make it, it was so good. Like, better than my Mexican husbands good.. But I'll never admit that to him. The atmosphere was like something I've never seen in a pub/bar. There was a little sitting area almost looked like something from a Starbucks or cafe. I love candles and I noticed several candle warmers for a little ambiance. It was still darkly lit and some fun characters in & out. Did I mention Tracy is the shit? He let us choose some music, made great drinks & really excelled in customer service & hospitality."}
{"text":"The machines used to pay out, and were comparable payouts to everyone else. NOT so anymore! Bartenders have been quitting, customers are asked to leave whenever they hit a jackpot."}
{"text":"Great place!  My husband I went in there for the first time on a whim, just a few beers.  It is super clean, modern and the staff is very friendly.  They have a super happy hour with 2-$5 big draft beers and $5.00 appetizers.  We had chicken fingers which was more than I could eat that came with 4 big fingers and fries...  Hubby had hot wings, 12 nice sized wings in the basket with veggies.  It was great good for $10 and the staff is really nice!"}
{"text":"This place was formerly known as, \"The Junction\" and has recently been changed to \"Five Star Tavern\". Anyway, been here twice already and figured I'd write a short review.  This place is definitely a lot bigger than it looks. Very spacious inside with a 360 bar with gambling machines on them. There are two pool tables on the western side of the venue right when you walk in. They look like they're in pretty good condition too. The times I've been here, they have been renovating and it keeps looking better and better everytime I go in here. It's a cool place to chill and watch some sports while drinking some cheap beer. You also get a complimentary drink if you're gambling which is quite nice. The kitchen is not yet ready from what the bartender told me but will be open in about a week's time. I will definitely be back here. It's been kind of dead both times I've been but I expect that to change once the word gets out about this place.   Gripe 1: I wish they turned up the volume on the T.Vs whenever the game is playing because it's definitely too quiet in there sometimes. Plus I love it when I can hear the game(even if it's on low volume).   Gripe 2: No top or medium shelp liquor. No Crown, Jack, Ciroc, Patron, Don Julio. This actually made me really sad :(  All in all though, I can't complain too much about this place and I will be back! If I know I am going to go to a place more than just a couple times, then it's gotta qualify for at least 4 stars :D"}
{"text":"Had a very good breakfast at a very reasonable price.  Easily one of the best bar breakfasts I've had in ages.  Looking forward to trying happy hour.  We need good businesses in this area."}
{"text":"Not happy to find that those under 21 won't be served in this establishment. Would have been nice to know prior to stopping through w one of my 11 year olds in tow..."}
{"text":"This place is by far the worst food I've ever had. Total waste of money. Do not I repeat do not order from here. It is complete trash!"}
{"text":"Friendly wait staff, upscale decor, the front of the bar does not do it justice at all, had I known this bar would be this nice I would have visited it sooner! The food was great and the prices were reasonable :) tons of tv's to watch the games but not too overwhelming which is great if your going in to grab a few drinks and enjoy a date night. I highly recommend this bar!"}
{"text":"Our favorite place to spend our sunday funday mornings. We love to go and have breakfast every sunday morning. Food is fantastic and you can't beat the prices. Also, best bartender n waitress Clare is always there to take care of us"}
{"text":"I've been here three times in the last week and a half.  I have to say that I like it here.  It's been quieter two of the three times I went (weekdays), but I went on a Saturday and it was pretty busy.  I think the poor cook is all by himself in the back because it took a little bit for the food to come out; every time we've come here, he was the one who was bringing out he food, not anyone else, so I think the fellow's alone.  It's not a big deal, though.  The service is good and the staff is friendly.  My boyfriend and I started coming here after having not such a great experience at Sierra Gold further up north on Aliante Pkwy.  I've had \"Our Best Burger,\" the chicken parmesan (dinner and sandwich), and the fish and chips so far.  All of them were good, but my favorite is the chicken parm.  I thought it was neat that they slice the chicken up for you, too, haha (I uploaded a pic).  [Edit: found out that there is another cook (he has a ponytail), but we've only seen him twice.  The one guy we always saw before cuts the chicken up for you; this other guy doesn't.  Not a big deal, but I found out why my meal came out different a couple of times, but still delicious every time. xP]  My boyfriend found the chili dogs to be disgusting.  If I recall correctly, he was given two and he only ate one and a third because he couldn't stomach them anymore.  The only thing I don't like about this place (and other places I've been to here) is that people smoke indoors.  I just moved to Nevada from NJ and back at home, no one breaks this law (in any establishment I've been to), so this is the most second-hand smoke I've had to inhale in years. :(  As much as I like it, I'm considering not going as often.  I'm already a non-smoker and prefer to date non-smokers.  I can find other places to eat and drink without having to put my health on the line, too.  Having to wash my clothes after visiting because I smell like an ashtray is also getting annoying.  Other than that, though, I like this place.  Good service, good food."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY the best daytime bar in Vegas.  The daylight cocktail goddess Anita, will re-fill the beverage of your choice before you even know you are ready.  We have been in Vegas for 32 years, and you just can't find service like this anymore.  That is why you will only find us there on Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday.  Stephanie and Jim run a bar that is both classy and blue collar at the same time. The decor is dark wood and timeless elegance, but the vibe is everyday fun.  The Rancho/Craig location is our favorite neighborhood bar, but the Five Star at the location of the previous Cooler Lounge (for you native Vegans) is another favorite of ours. There you will find Omar...the finest cook of Cuban cuisine this side of...well...CUBA ! !  For a good time, visit Anita at Rancho and Craig.  All you bikers out there will find it next to your favorite leathers store, facing Craig.  Five Star is the best Vegas has to offer, and it is our daytime bet for good food and good gaming odds.  Barbara and Ed Andrews"}
{"text":"Horrible smoke and cigar smell. We sat at the bar for 5mins without anyone approaching to wait on us. They weren't even busy. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Wish there was a Zero stars button. Besides some of the staff, I'd never be back. Who has a bar that doesn't carry Jack Daniels, Jameson, Crown Royal, Fireball and I'm sure many more I can't think of. So if you want a dive bar with nothing but cheap booze here's your place. Oh I forgot to mention they have NO cable TV?!? So good luck watching sports."}
{"text":"Love this place great food, prices and Best customer service. We go often and is our favorite in 89108. Yayy keep up the great work."}
{"text":"Like many others, I was apprehensive on entering this place. Upon entering, we were pleasantly surprised. The décor has a cozy feel, and there are TVs galore!  We visited the place around 1am, and when 230am hit, the crowd picked up (we were told by the bartender that 230am becomes one of their busier times).   We visited the place with a 'regular' patron, and we sat for a few hours, watching him try his luck on one of the machines at the bar. The bartender (I want to say his name is Cory) was friendly and quick to fill our needs.   While there, the regular patron we were with told us his experiences of the supernatural kind. Apparently, shady things have gone down in the place, and there may or may not be permanent residents not of this world, who haunt the spot and are apt to take down photos hanging on the walls. I also may or may not have had my husband stand at the door when I went to the ladies room, because I am a big chicken. Good news-I survived without a supernatural scare.   This place has been around a long time, which makes for fun conversation.   Drink prices were standard, and my mixed drinks were made just how I like it. The other people I were with are beer guys, no surprises there.  Now that we know the vibe, we will definitely be visiting this spot again."}
{"text":"Excellent food & good prices! We had breakfast of chicken fried steak (sure looked and tasted fresh, not frozen), largish and yummy, and bottomless pancakes, also large and very good.  Friendly service. The food, as others have noted, was served by the cook, who was a nice guy. Good find!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised! My husband and I stopped by to check it out and have dinner. Very yummy, with a great price to go along with it. We played a little bit and had some cocktails. The bartenders were very nice, great personalities. Bekah was funny and made great drinks. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a relaxing night out."}
{"text":"3.5*   Solid local pub chain nestled within Sun City Summerlin overlooking Palm Valley Golf Course (it shares an entry with the Pro Shop) is this friendly little joint Mom and her pals frequent. In cooler weather, the patio is a nice place to enjoy a meal or drinks; though the restaurant is non-smoking, the patio is not.   Prices are very reasonable for food and drinks, they do run Happy Hour specials, have those hot dog griller things, video poker at the bar, and a couple of private machines. Service has always been friendly, the bartender/server last night was a charming and cheerful fellow.   I'm a fan of their soups, salads, burgers, and wings. Mom had the biggest chicken fingers I have ever seen last night, and though she could only tackle 1/3 last night, she is having one right now for lunch; she also enjoyed a basket of crispy fries. My Cajun Bleu burger was served bunless and medium rare as ordered, the cole slaw was tasty and not mayo logged which I appreciated. 4* meal.   Love that we can hop in the golf cart and grab a quick bite or drink, and Mom can socialize with her posse close by in my absence."}
{"text":"Katie and Richard A.kA. dick Thank you for the lesseon Horrible service. Other then SHAKInG our Hand AnD iNTRo wiTH your names. To that wE  THank u."}
{"text":"Very slow service.  Came in tonight and waited almost 20 minutes to get our order taken.  The worse part is that it was absolutely dead in there, so there shouldn't have been any reason for us to wait that long.    The inside is very clean and the decor is nice, however."}
{"text":"This bar is fantastic! It's in the Desert Shores area on Del Webb and Rampart! Now tip: it looks private but it's open to anyone! If you're in Henderson and in the area, you can stop by! It has a private parking lot which comes in handy. When you come into the building, there's a gift shop to your right and the bar to your left. The bar is open 24 hours but the store isn't! They do have gambling and there is NO SMOKING. That has to be one of my favorite parts. If you don't feel like sitting at the bar, there is a whole section where you can go be sat at. Booths! You can also go and sit outside (in the back area) and there is a GORGEOUS view of the golf course. Seriously that view alone makes this place amazing. It's a gorgeous bar inside but outside is just beautiful. I have pictures of it as well that I've posted. They don't start making food till 5 am so there is a good 6 hours without food but if you have the chance, at least get their cheese steaks. They're never over cooked and perfectly seasoned! I add mayo and extra mushrooms on it. They also have monte cristos that are just delicious! If you're gambling, it kind of sucks that you don't get stuff like jack and cokes comped because Jack is a higher priced alcohol there. Their standard whiskey is fine to me though! I recommend coming here. They do have multiple locations so keep an eye out!"}
{"text":"This was not a plesant experience. Went in after work. Order was appetizer, drink and played 3 cent poker. Received  food and drink was good. Stopped playing poker to eat. Waitress Felicia came over and was told to move down so two players can sit together. We said, \"No!\" We are eating. Felicia said, \"The machine is reserved for players!\"  Told Felicia, \"Was playing, now eating.\" This Tavern does not serve minority, well."}
{"text":"Don't let the outside of the this establishment fool you- a great local bar with really great food! My husband and I were shocked at how good the food was and the price tag did not break the bank. The portions were generous and there was a really wide selection.  Loved that this was a more laid back atmosphere- I didn't like that our waitress also worked behind the bar. Since we were sitting in the dining room, she had to man the bar so she didn't have a lot of opportunity to check on us. But overall a great place to have a quiet affordable dinner with the family and still get very high quality food.  Try the appetizer platter \"All In\" - amazing!! Chips and salsa + 2 sliders + Chicken tenders + Buffalo wings + Mozzarella sticks!! WHAT?!?! 3 - 4 people could share this easily."}
{"text":"I like this place, the bartenders are cool and the atmosphere is smooth - I will definitely be coming back to this spot since it's soo smooth and quality.  We have had great, shitty, and decent bartenders so having a great one is amazing."}
{"text":"We stopped in here on a day so hot, my steering wheel burned the hair off my hands. The AC was running cool, my cocktail, ice cold. I didn't get any food but it looked and smelled tasty. I played 20.00 and won 200.00. Mikey is a cool, funny bartender there, ask him where Jimmy Hoffa is buried. Definitely a good time."}
{"text":"Little gem! Bartender Alisha is attentive and very pleasant. Good is really good as well. Look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"We went in this place last week for breakfast, no bacon, no oj no sausage potatoes ect we turned around and walked out. The server also said there was no budwiser beer. How can the sun city folks let this happen we will go elseware to hit golf balls from now on."}
{"text":"This used to be a good place to get a drink and a bite to eat. I don't know if they changed management or what but they went downhill. The last time my friend and I came here we waited 20 minutes for a drink while the two bartenders just sat there and bullshitted. Then after asking for a menu we were told that the chef would be out to talk to us about the menu. Well 45 minutes later with no menu we left. Since this place is usually pretty good I didn't let that stop me from giving them one more chance. Went back again around noon and the bartender Jennifer was amazing! Very attentive! Once again we were told that the chef would come out and talk to us about the menu, which he did in a timely manner this go around. Basically in a nutshell they only serve \"sliders and fries\" or \"wings and fries\". What kind of menu is that? Sadly, another decent spot gone to crap."}
{"text":"They have a large photograph of a martini, on the front door, very enticing. But nothing but very cheap vodka and a bartender that doesn't know how to make one."}
{"text":"Food is pretty tasty. Service is really good. No real drinks specials but I love the look of the place and I always win a bit of cash from their video poker."}
{"text":"Worst slots in Vegas. Great food from that cook though. Think his name was Rob. That's the only reason this please gets 2 stars. They should change their name to no star tavern. Plus I heard the greedy owners give the bar staff shit when theirs a big payout. Come on."}
{"text":"Time to ditch this place. Came for a late bite last night 6/14 and had the worst service in my multiple visits here.   My boyfriend had 20 minute wait for another drink, our food came out and sat by the wait staff for 10 minutes getting cold, until WE went and grabbed it. My boyfriend also got the completely WRONG food. He wasn't acknowledged after 10 minutes of trying to get someone's attention.   Watching the bartenders chit chat while we sat neglected was not my idea of a good atmosphere. I guess this is a place where if you are not a regular you get treated to poor service."}
{"text":"The burger wasn't great, generic frozen patty with no real flavor. They also lacked any IPAs at all, which was pretty disappointing. They don't carry sports events except for what is on regular TV.   What saves this place is that they have excellent customer service. The bartenders were friendly and attentive and it was clear that the regulars were well taken care of."}
{"text":"While the staff I've met at this location and the Craig and Rancho location have all been friendly and very responsive, this has to be the most badly managed bar I've been to period. They never carry the most popular liquors, the bartenders are unable to make most popular drinks. This location doesn't even have Red Bull behind the bar. However, they DO have a machine you can buy it from and bring it to the bartender. They advertise beers and alcohols they don't actually carry. They do have a decent food menu. But they rarely have the items in their kitchen. They don't have any cable channels on the several TVs they have. So don't expect to be able to watch a game. It seems to be a wine bar, but the neighborhood doesn't seem to be the right area. To sum up, this bar is anything but a \"5 star\" rating. If you want good customer service, great place. It's the only thing this bar offers."}
{"text":"Cool place.  Good atmosphere.  Food was really tasty.  Bartender was really friendly.  She made great recommendations for food and since it was happy hour all apps were very affordable!  She also made us great drinks!  The machines did well to keep my wife and I entertained.  A great place that I will definitely return to!"}
{"text":"Stopped in this afternoon for a quick drink and the place was pretty much dead. The bartender was sitting on one side of the bar, instead of being behind it, with the only other customer in the bar watching TV. I deliberately sat on the other side of the bar, which is blocked by a row of cubbyholes which makes it impossible to see what is happening on the other side of the bar, just to see how long it would take for her to notice me.   It took a couple of minutes, but she got me my drink and disappeared back to watching TV. There was no other interaction, no asking me if I had been in there before or checking to see if I wanted another drink. Out and out LOUSY customer Service! Plus my drink was more expensive than the same drink at Texas Station!  I don't know about the other locations, but this one should be renamed \"One Star Tavern\"!"}
{"text":"I stopped in on my way home from work not only did they not have my Johnnie  walker scotch but the stake sandwich I ate made me sick for two days! Needless to say I'll never go back and if you know what's good for you should ad void going here at all costs!"}
{"text":"We ate the club, house salad, potato soup, and the philly sandwich.  Everything was excellent.  The atmosphere was warm and inviting and the service was the best!"}
{"text":"Mike was super helpful and gave me accommodations when my turn down for what, got turned down for what.  The chick kept trying to get me to go hang out at wild fires to \"preserve life\" which was kinda nice.  All and all good experience!  Food was pretty decent, Micolob Ultras were a little strong."}
{"text":"Never too crowed.  Always friendly service.  Good prices and good food.  A variety of TVs to watch while enjoying conversation, gaming, food or drinks."}
{"text":"Cool local bar where the prices are right. Everything on the menu is between $7-13. Got a club sandwich that was more than solid. Turkey burger was one of the best we've had in the city. Thanks for a boatload of tater tots too. Vodka & soda $4.50. Very nice. Also have Labatt Blue on tap. Yum Yum. A great spot to watch sports with some of the biggest TVs at a bar you'll find in Vegas. Don't judge the book by its cover. The inside is very nice."}
{"text":"Sad, sad situation here.  Used to be a nice place with good staff, food was always tasty.  Last visit we had some wings that were not quite cooked; however, we wrote that off as a bad night. Most the Michael  Goddard pictures are gone, many menu items Are no longer available although still on the Menu!  Microwave chili was microwaved after onions were sprinkled on.  Chicken cordon blue, don't do it.  I will say the tater tots were excellent! Waitress disappeared after we ordered although we were the only folks dining. Whoever owns this place Needs to Make this 5star great again or build a wall around it to keep disappointed diners away. This place used to be a contender, I suggest going to The Draft House or Any drive thru.  Time to rethink what this place can be!"}
{"text":"I'm a frequent visitor to Five Star Tavern, I live in SunCity so it's convenient for me.  When Chris is there the service is great.  My biggest complaint is their menu, many of the items on there menu are not available .  There the other night at 6pm and they had no onion rings or bacon for burgers as they advertised on their menu.  This is not the first time this has happened, disappointing.  One more chance or I'll be moving my business...."}
{"text":"Bill(Bartender) is the shit!!!!  The most excellent customer service I've had in a while!  I just came from 2 different bars(PT's sierra gold & the other one, I will not mentioned)  had somewhat borderline service.  Bill, right away got to serve us but got to be talkative and also very attentive to our needs!!!!   Recommended place to come and have a good time."}
{"text":"You can read my other reviews to see how badly this place has gone downhill.  But today, they had no money to pay people who hit in their machines.  No money.  Not even for the girl next to us who was trying to cash out $100.  NO MONEY. Wow.  The manager took 3 hours to show up with an unprofessional attitude and our money...finally.  This will be my last review of this place since I will not be going back.  Well, maybe if they get a coin operating company.....and a new manager....but things right now are awful.  I have filed a complaint with Nevada Gaming Commission- maybe they can regulate some shit."}
{"text":"Wanted to have a drink after golf Tuesday afternoon with my friends and decided to sit on the patio. We waited over 15 minutes and no one came to wait on us. I finally went in and two employees were at the register talking and laughing and there was no one in the bar. The service at the location is unbelievable and this is not the first time it has happened. We will take our own beer on the course from now on. If you are interested in good service, avoid this location."}
{"text":"This 5 Star Tavern is the best bar in town.  Delicious food, great service, unbeatable food and drink specials.  Extremely clean bar and bathroom areas."}
{"text":"Went in for breakfast today and wasn't impressed. The coffee was cold and service was lacking. I specifically ordered my eggs scrambled very well and cooked well done. Of course that wasn't the case. That's a deal breaker for me.  We will be back as the atmosphere is good and it isn't smoky but won't order breakfast again."}
{"text":"Very nice bar and the prices are very reasonable, if they put 2 (diamond) tables in there instead of 1 bar table and 1 build at home type pool table it would make this bar a very awesome place to hang out at and take pool league teams all week 24/7."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good for a tavern. It's extra clean inside. 9 big screen tvs. The food is good and the prices are better. Service was great. Happy hour 7 days a week from 3pm to 7pm and 1am to 3am with $5 appetizers. Philly cheesesteak was good. No kids here. 21 and up only."}
{"text":"Food was good: Best Burger with condiments on the side and cheese ToTs, yummy. People were great Amy behind the bar was very attentive and the cook made my food, my way. Mahalo Plenty for the good times with my friends. Derek K."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews I had to check this place out.  I like that they greet everyone that walks in.  Nice touch that seems to be forgotten these days.  I sat at the bar and Mark quickly came over to introduce himself.  Asked if I was hungry and made a suggestion of the Beef Sliders.  They were delicious.  Food was priced good and the beer was nice and cold.  Mark and Alisha (sp?) always checked to make sure I was taken care of.  Great local bar. Also I think it's cool that the owner actually reads these reviews and responds.  That says a lot.  Keep up the good work... I'm hooked :)"}
{"text":"Great place. Cheap happy hour prices (5-7pm) on food and drinks. Never super smokey. Larry is the best cook! He has a pony tail, and if you see him, your food will be guaranteed great.  edit as of 7/30:  I'm not sure if it's management, or the owners, but this place has gone down hill. I will never return to this place, or any of the other establishments. The food quality has gone down hill, the beer glasses always have a funny smell, and they are often out of certain draft beer.   Their gaming cards are also a joke. I played there for several months and assumed I had $90 in tokens, when it was only $9 dollars. The staff seem to be looking for employment elsewhere, and I don't blame them. It's a revolving cast of new employees every time I went in. I hate to say it, but you can get cheaper drinks and food at any PT's or similar establishment. Don't give money to owners/mgmt who treat their employees like trash."}
{"text":"My Drink Was Comped and Served Immediately After Sitting Down to Play Table Top Electronic Gaming. Casual/Divey Atmosphere For Area Locals. Servers Were Friendly and Inside Looked Updated and Clean. ATM Machine Was Available and Worked. Television's Above Bar Had Various Sports Games On and Classic Rock Music Was Loud Enough to Drown Out Chatter. I Didn't Eat Their, But I Did Notice a Menu on The Table.   Best Thing: Machine Let Me Play For A Long Time Without Having to Reboot It"}
{"text":"Wow! The inside is so beautiful, the staff is so friendly, got my ice cold beer promptly and the gaming machines were HOTT, people were winning left and right! Definitely my new favorite bar on the north side!"}
{"text":"The bartender (guy) always seems angry or annoyed. Does he do his job, yes. However it sure seems like he hates his job. I wouldn't want my staff to seem miserable if I was the owner....."}
{"text":"This is a nice place, close to where we live (close enough to walk home if we had too much to drink) and they have the best happy hour. Their HH is from 2pm until 7pm and 1am until 5am. Long Islands are $4 during happy hour and the bartenders make it nice and strong. All other drinks are half off I believe. Nice, casual spot to just go grab a drink and/or a bite. The potato cheese soup is to die for, I get that every time; my husband loves their chicken strips. Bartenders and the cook are very friendly."}
{"text":"If i could give it no stars i would.  My husband and i went in a month ago he asked if they had certain alcohol she said no.  Then we asked for shots she didn't have certain alcohol to make the shots.  We left.  We decided maybe they didn't have their shipment and went back on May 4th i ordered a Captain and Coke. She said they were out of Coke... wait what??? Then the food was wrong we ordered chicken nachos and they forgot the chicken so it was sent back... when it came back to us it was the same now cold and soggy nachos with chicken.  So disgusting never will we be back!! I rather support 5star over Sierra Gold corporation but not with this service"}
{"text":"A hidden gem, where you can find a full menu and even breakfast 24/7. Good food, very responsive service, many televisions, and even Goddard artwork! A mini pub, and apart from an initial smoky smell when entering,  this is a good spot for adults only for cold beer and domestic wines and good food, especially at hours when others close or limit their menus.  Certainly worth a try."}
{"text":"It's nice and clean inside. However I've been there 3 times. Kitchen is inconsistent, twice no cook. And I ordered a bottle water and was told no bottle water only tap . Won't be back. Three strikes YOUR OUT!! This place is totally neglected."}
{"text":"If you are coming here for drinks and a little video poker. . . Don't!!! They don't have a rewards program unless you were a member from the past.  They say a rewards program is coming. Been saying it for months.  Obviously this place is poorly organized.  Happy hour is a joke.  Fifty cents to a dollar off a beer, wine or cocktail.  I asked the waitress if they comp drinks while we're playing?  She said they do.  Then after my two brews and my wife had two rum and cokes they brought me a bill.   They said they come one drink for every $20 you out in. Definitely not the kind of happy hour you get at PT's. I'll be back for the food and atmosphere but never to gamble and certainly not for the worst happy hour in town."}
{"text":"We randomly went into Five Star Tavern Saturday because we were looking for a place to play pool.  YAY for cheap pool tables.  $1 for one game or I think it was $2 for 3 games.  It was quiet.  Several people at the bar and a larger party at a table in the dining area.  Everyone was eating but I didn't stare their food down so not sure if it looked great but it did smell good.  Very quaint place.  The bartender was friendly.  Ordered 2 Bud Lights on tap...$5.00 YAY again.  Decent atmosphere and cheap drinks in Vegas are a rare commodity.  We will definitely go back for more pool and drinks."}
{"text":"We went in today and were served by Megan (according to the receipt, I am horrible with names and forgot)  Service was fantastic, very friendly and genuine. The drinks were perfectly made, and lastly the food was great!   I think we may have found our new go to place!"}
{"text":"This bar was one of my fav but now sucks they don't serve Coronas or stela. Beers any more"}
{"text":"I walked in and was greeted as I took a seat while putting a 20 in the new machine. I ordered 1 beer and a few min later ordered nachos. Durring my meak I was constantly playing max bet on a penny keno machine. I ordered another beer and life was good and so were the nachos. I asked for my bill and was given the check for 2 beers and my food. When asked why the beer she said ....um well how much did you play?  she saw me put in a 20 and obviously did not cash out at all. I was playing the entire time. I spent less than 30 min there start to finish. It is VERY BAD business to not tell a slot player they are being charged for drinks!!!! I will NEVER return and I live walking distance from there. Its not the first time it has happened there, I have seen others leave also."}
{"text":"Appetizers not terrible for the price. Regardless, quality was subpar. Patties on sliders Were overcooked and the nacho platter lacked meat even with additional meat ordered with meal. I have not given the entrées a try, but the appetizers were a let down. Bartender was polite, but not engaging at all.  The facility itself is nice, but that's not enough to have me come back for low quality food."}
{"text":"Save yourself the trouble go somewhere else. Owner pays employees bare minimum and not one minute over so even though they're hourly its like they're salary . This company is cheap. Joyce is the best ."}
{"text":"Horrible service had only one bartender not a good selection on drinks no food only appetizers waited 45 mins for a shot then another thirty or the nice girl to go make my 13 dollar chicken fingers yeah no I've always seen this bar when I walk into BaskinRobbins and it was my worst choice I've made this place is horrible #bringduffy'sback"}
{"text":"A Four Star Tavern  Recently, I enjoyed two post-hiking dinners with my friend and her mother in the Five Star Tavern. It made sense that a day of hiking adventures ended with dining adventures here. Situated in the far west of the Las Vegas Valley in Sun City Summerlin, it is near Red Rock Canyon, Lone Mountain, and the Summerlin trail network. Contradictory to the striking Red Rock mountains, Five Star Tavern is inconspicuous. In Sun City Summerlin the zoning codes mandate limited use of signing. Consequently it is easy to mistake Five Star Tavern for a private golf course lounge. If it wasn't for my friend, I would of been impervious to this Tavern.  Five Star Tavern can best be described as a laid back environment. It is in a part of Las Vegas where golf carts outnumber one-armed bandits and golf courses outnumber casinos. On account of the fact that it is in close proximity to the senior citizen clubs in the adjacent Sun City Mountain Shadows Community Center, there is also a community environment. In this laid back environment, parking in the large parking lot is a breeze.  When guests walk into the Five Star Tavern, the Tavern is to the left. To the right is the golf pro shop. Straight down the hall are the restrooms then doors opening to the Palm Valley Golf Course.  The first thing that people see inside the Tavern proper is the generous wine selection. A few steps away people will see the bar, a hot dog griller, and a few gaming machines. Beyond the bar is the dining room and patio overlooking the Palm Valley Golf Course.  What is striking about the Five Star Tavern is that instead of the focus being inside, the focus is the beautiful golf course outside. This is the first Tavern that I can recall seeing an abundance of sun. The scenery is so striking that I have come up with a new category of dining. I have named this category scenic dining. Under the scenic dining model: decent to great food at a reasonable price with spectacular outdoor scenery equals a remarkable dining experience. Five Star Tavern joins Big Horn Cafe in Mount Charleston and Devine Cafe in Springs Cafe on my Scenic Dining List. Over dinner, I enjoyed watching the sundown over the Palm Valley Golf Course and seeing the geese and waterfowl in the pond. Unfortunately my friend did not share in this experience since she was facing the bar. The trick to scenic dining is to face the outdoor scenery.  Under the scenic dining model, the majestic scenery makes up for inconsistent service. This is the landscape that I would normally enjoy by sitting on a bench without a care in the world. It seemed likewise that the waitress during the August 26 visit did not have a care in the world. Well at least our table. She took our order then delivered our food then stayed at the bar. I would have to walk to the fountain to refill my glass with Coke. On the contrary, the waitress on the September 3 visit was attentive.  If the service was inconsistent both the good food and value was consistent. On August 26, I ordered the chicken parmesan with noodles. It was a hand breaded chicken breast that the cook seasoned to a golden brown texture. Red marina sauce and provolone cheese topped off the chicken parmesan that was served over pasta noodles. The noodles tasted and looked identical to spaghetti. It came with garlic bread. To compliment the $8.99 meal, I paid an additional $2 for cream of potato soup. Both the entrée and soup are a thumbs up. On September 3, I ordered fish and chips. It was made from white fish filets that was lightly fried. The fish and chips may not be the best in the world, however, they hold their own as far as taste. Ditto for the fries and cole slaw that came with it. It was worth $7.50.  If Five Star Tavern was in my part of the Valley perhaps I would visit has frequently as my friend. However, it is close to the 215-Beltway creating a charming dinner spot close to the Lake Mead Boulevard exit. Perhaps this could be an appropriate half way break between Mount Charleston and Henderson. Perhaps, I might not be back in a while. What is certain is that based on my experiences here, this is a Four Star Tavern."}
{"text":"This place is a good little local spot if your going to grab food and a drink and head out. It's a good happy hour. Never that busy though. Tbe workers are nice and attentive. The one thing I liked is that it would be a perfect place to watch football. The tvs are new and huge."}
{"text":"This is a surprising neighborhood gem. A little deceiving from the outside as it looks like every other 24 hour bar/ food/ gaming establishment in Las Vegas.  Once inside, it is noticeably upscale and more comfortable that just an average tavern in town. I was there in the afternoon so not sure of the night time energy but even the music was serene.  I had the Santa Fe Chicken salad which was delicious. It came with spicy ranch dressing.  The kitchen even accommodated a special request.  Claire was fabulous and very attentive.   She seemed genuine about make sure I had a great experience. Rare is this town these days. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Ice cold beer. Need i say more. Stopped in the other day to cool off and quench my thirst. Thanks for the friendly atmosphere and conversation. Ill be back for more. Ill be sure to tell all my friends also"}
{"text":"Quant atmosphere, pleasant bartenders, sultry, great place to meet for a drink."}
{"text":"Not sure what happened over the past few months, but this is not the Five Star I used to know and love.  Sure the prices are still reasonable and the waitress is still very pleasant, but they no longer serve Labatt Blue, now only play country music, and the wings are not what they used to be.  Unfortunately, this may be my last time at Five Star unless I read things have gone back to how they used to be when I was a regular."}
{"text":"First time here. We got the sirloin and loaded nachos and a Coke. Came out just under $20. Everything was really good. Friendly staff. We will definitely be back again soon."}
{"text":"So every time I'm in 5 star tavern it's been a good experience. The food is priced right and the BEER!! Oh yeah can't forget that they have it. Along with the sports it's quite a man cave if you ask me."}
{"text":"My Husband and I were there last night, we waited for a good ten MINS before even being served and that's only because a Regular customer had to yell at one of the girl bartenders to come down to our end of the bar,,,,I think we interrupted her dinner she was eating!!! we ordered our dinners, asked for ketchup (empty bottle) asked for a full bottle,we got one slammed down in front of us........I confronted the bartender about the service, she said she would adjust our bill, I told her its not about the money.......IT\"S CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!! if you don't have good customer service, you have no business left........She came up with SOO many excuses as to why our service was HORRIBLE, needless to say we paid our bill, left and will not be back!!!"}
{"text":"This place cant seem to keep staff and no wonder when the place is discusting. Glasses that have dust on them that they serve out of. Grossness everywhere. But no customers and they cheat employees out of wages. You too will have to beg for wages if you work here. No wonder they are always hiring."}
{"text":"Great local neighborhood Tavern.  Remodeled and refreshed! I was expecting a dive bar when my friend invited me for a beverage. Instead, it was a comfortable, warm, friendly place with a simple, classic menu, strong drinks and friendly employees.  Large tvs for sports viewing and plenty of off bar seating for the non-gamers. The food and drinks are very affordable.  $5 appetizers for happy hour and super cold beer. 5 star tavern is a good bet for a casual fun time."}
{"text":"Would never come here again. The beer (hef) on draft tasted like it had metal in it... Yuk. My husband ordered a bottle bud light instead. The food was mediocre and overcooked. It took a long time for the food to come out. My father in law enjoyed his breakfast, but the rest of us that ordered appetizers and other dishes were unimpressed. I wish we had gone to Tiabi!!"}
{"text":"Tonight I dined and drank at Five Star having their chicken nachos and 2 Boston Lagers. I put $100 in the machine and played Black Jack for an hour. I was comped for my 2 Boston Lagers by Shantelle and then left the bar after paying $8.50 and a tip to Shantelle. My fiancé came 20-30 minutes later. He also drank and dined. He was advised by Shantelle that due to her comping my drinks earlier in the evening she could not comp any of his drinks. We played on separate player's club cards and weren't in the bar at the same time. We missed each other by 30 minutes.   I am appalled and disgusted by the way my fiancé was treated by the bar staff and making an excuse that they couldn't comp his drinks due to my previous comps. We don't have the same last name and we play on separate cards. I have since written Five Star's corporate email and hope to hear back from them.   I have been a loyal patron and have never received such poor, disinterested service from both Shantelle and the other bartender an Asian lady that I have no idea what here name is. This will be my final visit to Five Star. I will speak with my feet and take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Five Star Tavern is GREAT the staff are nice plesent and very welcoming everytime. I go to Five Star quite offten because I love the atmosphere and the food is great."}
{"text":"I have continued on my tour of hole in the wall bars and thankfully landed here!  I have passed theis little gem for 4 years now as I go to the grocery store weekly and was not drawn in by the exterior. It was bought a couple of years ago by the Five Star Tavern chain and they have done a very nice job inside. Thanks to Yelp I decided to give it a try for a lunch and some gambling.  The interior is very welcoming and clean. Large bar, some big screen TV's and gaming plus many nice tables and booths. The bartenders are very friendly and my husband and I enjoyed chatting with them throughout our visit. We sat at the bar and ordered some lunch while gambling. I had a BLT with avocado and tater tots. Everything on the sandwich was great, bacon cooked well, not too much mayo. Tater tots were delicious. My husband liked his sliders and fries too. Both very reasonably priced.   Our gambling money lasted a long time and the draft beer was good and cold. I live close enough to this place to stop in more often. A good find!"}
{"text":"Just stopped by, and it has disappeared  I am very disappointed because it was the only smoke free casino that I know of. I'm from PA and visit quite often"}
{"text":"Food at 5 Star is always spot on! My wife and I have never had bad food at either the Simmons location or Rancho and Craig which is our new spot.  Don't let the setting fool you as it very nice inside.  The bartenders are friendly and service is great."}
{"text":"Not sure what has been going on behind the scenes but the 5 Star quality is slipping. Old familiar faces are disappearing as well as the drink quality and payouts. Last time in my wife threw a 20 in a machine and we ordered a Jack&Coke and a Jameson-Sprite ,11 bucks for two drinks was a bit steep considering my wife was playing. We wondered if any booze was poured in the drinks at all. New bartenders could be why but a poor drink should not be poured!   We have been regulars for over 2 years and it is losing our go to bar status. Knock knock 5 Star management.......what happened to the quality fun bar?  Bit of hope here....a couple of the original bar tenders are still there and they are awesome, Meghan and Carrie plus the food was still great as of our last visit sometime in mid April."}
{"text":"The people workibg here are amazing.  Coming in for menu roulette can be fun, not really.  No more draft beer is terrible, it's already cost this location customers that came in every day.  The owners won't listen to the bartenders on what will keep customers coming in.  No sattellite tv anymore, Are they trying to make the place fail?  I've been comi g in for years but will head elsewhere.  The owners won't even stock traditional beers.  After menu roulette now it's beer roulette!  What's the matter with the owners????  PULL YOIR HEAD OUT!!!!."}
{"text":"This was the worst meal we ever had here. We used to go here specifically for the food. But the quality has changed so much that I doubt we will ever return to this place."}
{"text":"Now the only reason I'm giving this place 2 starts is because my bartender was amazing. And it's not her fault for any of what I'm about to write. So I came here to part the time while my truck was being worked on. To start they didn't have a huge beer selection. The bartender let me know they had run out on most of their beers. Then I decided to order some good. While the menu has much to offer, this place has just about nothing. Which to me is crazy considering this place is a chain. So finally after going over half the menu the one thing I decided to try was the chili. And to an even bigger disappointment the chilli was extremely cold. The cook couldn't even take the time to warm it up. So horrible. Luckily I had an awesome bartender and she took care of me and comped that horrible excuse for food.  Shewas very attentive nice and tried her best to keep me happy. Sheshould be working some where else other then a dump like this place. And shame on who ever runs this place for letting it run like that."}
{"text":"Well let's see here. It's called five star tavern but I can only give it 1 star and that's because the food was ok and the service was ok. Other than that, just not really a fun place. How do you discontinue wings and fingers. Also they have like 10 TV's but no cable or satellite service. Just antenna. So the night a buddy and I went there after a long work day and week, we got to sit there and watch the news instead of a sports program. Nice place inside but not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"No complaints! Nice quiet atmosphere. I like the local finds rather than chain restaurants. Mozz sticks were good as were out burgers. Service was great. Mentioned they had some good happy hour specials."}
{"text":"Food was great. The prices were awesome. We came at Happy Hour 3-7pm. The beer was icy cold and priced right.  I can't say enough about this hidden gem.  Interior was quite a surprise. Very clean. It's a casino and bar. open 24-7. Restaurant service is not overnight.  It's location is wrong on yelp directions.  Located on the Southside of the Smiths Plaza Palo Verde and Boulder Highway."}
{"text":"Second time I've gone in and had the worst meatball sub.  I used to get a delicious sub but now I get a microwaved, dried out sandwich. Dry meatballs. Top of the bun over nuked and rock hard, bottom of the bun completely soggy mess.  Good thing the bartenders are AMAZING! Friendly staff will bring me back, the food definitely will not!"}
{"text":"Five Star Tavern, a year in review...  I am fortunate to say that I have had the opportunity to get to know some of the greatest people I've ever met since I first visited this establishment at the end of 2013. It is clear that there is a lot of focus put in at the management level to find the right people that have very unique social lives and the ability to carry on full conversations with their customers. This is also seen through a recent 100% turnover where the only guys left were the cooks where their Bar Manager RJ worked and worked to get the best people on his team to reboot and I personally feel that he is doing very well at that.   As a smaller \"gamer\" I usually played $20-$60 dollars a night and would normally be seen there every day up until the point that I moved out of the state. Regardless of whether I was playing on a machine or sitting at an area of the bar, the staff would always have a full drink waiting for me from the point when I walked in the door to the point that I left hours and hours later. At no time have I ever felt any discrimination about this, felt like all of a sudden I appeared to be losing all the time, etc. This has been ongoing from the day after my first visit in 2013 and after I took a long break and revisited near the end of last year.  While there is definitely a preference at this point of who I would rather have cook my food, the differences between the cooks on their staff will not be noticeable to the casual customer who only visits every now and then. Larry without a doubt is their strongest cook/chef with a wide array of talents when it comes to their relatively cheap menu. The breakfast all day option is nice but the place is renowned for their \"sliders\". The only difference between Larry and Steve at this point besides a slight variation in taste is presentation and portion. As a frequent customer and I'm sure others will agree, the sigh of relief that we have when Larry opens the door behind the bar with your food is truly a great feeling. For those who are new visitors and you are reading this before you try the place, I would recommend a quesadilla from Larry if he is working.  Pros: The inside of the Five Star Tavern has everything to make someone feel at home. Awesome food at cheap prices, good friends, great staff, huge TVs everywhere you look, and you can tell how much effort the ownership puts into the aesthetics just by visiting other bars in the local area.  Cons: If there was anything that I wish I could personally change about this venue it would be having the ability to change the music being played to a game that is currently on. While I do understand that if the bar has many guests that wish cannot be granted, but only a couple others in there? Let the Staff decide on their own without the fear of getting in some sort of trouble. Also, no promotions besides one that was recently started by the bartenders for the Superbowl in what appeared to be a trial run. The Staff at Five Star Tavern find themselves doing most of their own self advertising on personal social media pages and spread news of their promotion via Facebook and word of mouth with next to no influence from upper management. Can anything be done to assist them to drive in new customers?  Overall, if changing the music to sports when the bar is empty and lack of promotions is the only issue this place is going to do extremely well. Considering that all of the gambling issues exist with those who play nearly $4,000.00 to $5,000.00 a night that will never really be an issue to the rest of the North Las Vegas bargoing community.  Thanks for the great year! Brian a.k.a. Africa"}
{"text":"Worst dining experience in recent memory. I visited with one other guest for breakfast on a Wednesday. For most of our meal, we were the only guests in the restaurant. Whoever your server is should be let go or repurposed.   After waiting an unacceptably long time for our beverages, we ordered. They're \"re-doing\" the menu, so they didn't have my first two choices. Why hand me a menu that you know is wrong without telling me? Stupid. Not considerate.   The coffee took no joke - half an hour to refill after t was empty. They don't have real cream, just the fake palm olive oil stuff.   Anyway, I order an omelet. No today, no potatoes. The server doesn't care, it comes about 30 minutes later with potatoes and toast because the server doesn't care.   All in all, we spent nearly 90 minutes in an otherwise empty tavern for two omelets. Not by choice - but because that's how long it took. During that time, we were ignored more frequently than we were welcomed.   I do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"We showed up here around 6 with our laptops and the intention of hanging out and doing some work.  5ST does NOT have free WiFi as Yelp suggested, so don't go there expecting to be able to jump online.  (Thank $.diety for tethering.)  The appetizers were mediocre and the service was slow.  They offered $5 apps until 7 PM, which we tried to take advantage of, but since the service was slow our waiter didn't check on us until after 7 and we got charged full price on two of the three we ordered.  He helped us out by comping a couple of drinks though.  The mozzarella sticks and chicken fingers were clearly frozen and reheated.  The chicken quesadilla was okay, but greasy.  Overall, just meh on the food.  I guess we showed up with higher expectations and left disappointed.  Slow service, fried frozen appetizers... nothing to write home about whatsoever."}
{"text":"I always love getting off work and coming to this bar to gamble. Plus the food is very high quality and never disappoints. Megan behind the bar makes the best cocktails and is always making sure my glass is never empty! Love Five Star Tavern! Great job guys"}
{"text":"I don't usually like to hang out in a bar but if I do I will go here.   When you enter its a nice candle aroma with a friendly smile from the awesome bartenders.  The food is always fabulous and the drinks are super cold. The locals that hang out there are also very friendly and it reminds me of the show cheers where everybody knows your name (or at least remembers your face and says hi and will hold a great conversation!) I have been going to this bar for a few years now and miss a couple of faces that got kicked out due to talking loudly when the owner came in one night! (I don't agree with that part!) I do like to bring my people here and show off my nice clean bar w/ the best bartenders ever! Thanks ladies, Martin and Rich for always making that rough day a little better!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this spot for a few years. Its been my favorite spot to bring the girls after a long work week or even a long work day!   The last 6 months they have let this place gooooo.  They run out bottled beer, limes, food, they have no wine glasses, no Pacifico, also they don't serve top shelf! Also one of the 2 bathrooms has been broken for almost 3 months and the air conditioner took 2 months to fix in the middle of summer. I was super excited to see the renovations and changes through the years, but am finding myself a new place. I absolutely love love love the bartenders and the people that are regulars are super awesome and supportive through all of this.  I wish the owners knew what they had and took care of their business and employees better so everyone was happy and would stay!   I'm so disappointed in the owners choices and wish they would get it together and stop blaming staff for their faults. If they only knew the joke that people call it one star now!"}
{"text":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Five Star!  Best little place with the best service ever!!  Five Star Friday's with Katie and Amy were the hi-light of my week (and date night tradition with the hubs) until my work schedule ended it.  Welcome though to Five Star Saturday morning with Jordan, my new after work spot!  6 am the guys from work and I love to go hang with Jordan and enjoy his exceptional service!  Bored on Saturday night, then Katie and Rich will keep you company (and keep you laughing all night!) And let me just tell you about Sunday morning breakfast with Terri!  She is the sweetest!  Always has our redbulls ready as soon as she see's us and knows my breakfast order by heart!  Can't beat Five Star Tavern on Craig and Rancho!  I fell in love with the place the first time I walked in the door and it's the only place I feel comfortable going by myself!"}
{"text":"This used to be one of the best unknown establishments in north town. I've been frequenting 2 of their bars fur no less than 5 years and was always very happy with their service. Don't blame the bartenders for the owners cheapness! In the last year They have eliminated at least 2 of my favorite entrees, ok, no big deal, but would it kill you to actually take off the menu?! The poor bartenders have to deal with the customers being upset that the food they want that is CLEARLY printed in the menu has been discontinued. In the last 10 visits at least 6 of them they have been completely out of red bull, i had to buy my own tonight (the cook was nice enough to run to the store and buy it for me with my own money) This place has REALLY gone downhill in the last year and the owner leaves the great bartenders to deal with his cheapness! I ONLY continue coming here because the bartenders make me (a single woman) feel safe, even throwing out men who have been completely inappropriate with their advances. If Mikey and Esther leave, so will I!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty nice neighborhood joint.  Pretty typical - but nice.  Stopped by and found some nice happy hour specials.  $5 appetizers and cheap draught beer.  Mostly a gaming establishment but it is a good place to throw a few beers back!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place! However the last two times have been disappointing. The service tonight is horrible. We always tip but based on service I think she is worthy of NO tip. Talk about feeling like nobody cares if you're here or not. Anyway last time here. Done"}
{"text":"Food is hit or miss, the bartenders are always super nice. Never crowded, I think it's good for football season. I have it three stars because of the whole food thing, I went there in the morning one time the food was amazing!!! Went there on a Thursday night about two weeks ago, got some fish and chips and wifey got a burger. Just nasty, I'm thinking to myself no one should be able to make a burger nasty. How do you mess up on fish and chips, how?"}
{"text":"Stopped by and I assumed they served food but the bartender said their kitchen has been closed for awhile. No food so I left."}
{"text":"Not a bad place but not the neighborhood bar we were hoping for. Shots are expensive and measly, obviously not measured to the ounce. If I'm paying $7 for a shot, I'd like what I pay for. Happens every time we try this place even with various bartenders. Lesson learned. The candles also give me headaches."}
{"text":"Been passing this daily.  Conveniently, it is down the street and is a nice exercise walk from my home..  Open 24 hours daily!  Menu covers from breakfast until dinner with a variety of items.  Food not bad...plentiful. Been there twice..Coffee never ending and the service was good.  Second visit was for cocktails on the patio and it was lovely sitting on the patio and looking out over the golf course. Cocktails were excellent and very affordable  It is a secret place that few know about unless you live in Sun City, but it is nice to have a cocktail without going far.  It is open to all......."}
{"text":"totally surprised by the food. really good for a pub/tavern/bar. really nice bartenders. a lot of tv's."}
{"text":"We were looking for lunch in Henderson and this was convenient.  However, we had to wait for the cook arrive -- curious as the outside signage promoted breakfast.  Once he arrived, we had to wait for the grill, fryers, etc to warm up.   The food finally came out, but it was just okay.  Sandwiches were over salted as were the fries.  But the bartender was friendly and the beers were cold.  I think we'll try another tavern in the chain -- let's be fair."}
{"text":"This is a nice little bar, open 24 hours for those late night outings. Everytime we've been there hasn't been many people so you don't have to do much to get the bartenders attention. Diann served us and she was amazing, such a  sweetheart and definitely a reason I'll come back. Drinks were cheap and the food was good for the price, it tastes like a slightly better version of  a homemade meal which I love. my only complaint was that they put wayyyyy too much cheese on my salad, of you order one maybe ask for it on the side. All in all great place!"}
{"text":"I couldn't resist trying out this poker bar in Sun City. I had visions of a mini Rampart Casino, which turns out to be somewhat accurate (minus the smoke!). I don't think they advertise much, and it's probably difficult to stumble upon this bar unless you're golfing here or know someone in Sun City.   The views are a big plus for this place, as it's located on the Palm Valley golf course. The bar, with gaming, has views right onto the course, and there's a patio adjacent to the bar also. They have 2 freestanding poker machines as well, if you don't want to socialize. The bar has a comfy vibe to it, and I was impressed with the wine selection. I had a pinot noir with my Monte Cristo sandwich with tater tots ($8.50) on the recommendation of the bartender. It's a very good sandwich, and the prices are reasonable.  For example, a \"dirty\" hot dog with chili is $2.99, and a regular hot dog is $1.99.   My drinks were comped while gaming, and other than being charged $1 more than the price on the menu for my sandwich (it was changed), I have only positive things to say. The tavern is open 24 hours, and when I asked about the late night crowd, I wasn't surprised to hear that there isn't one. I recommend dropping by (it's near the shopping area with the CVS) for some reasonably priced food, great wine selection and smoke free gaming!"}
{"text":"I am a local & I brought my family here on a Saturday. The invisible man could get a drink here before a non-regular. Never again."}
{"text":"The 3 stars are for the good service. I'm sorry I came in today. I ordered a breakfast special and I thought it was really odd that my plate came out so fast. The country potatoes and they weren't cooked all the way, they big chunks and crunchy. The bacon was extra greasy and didn't taste good, the sourdough bread/toast tasted like blue cheese? It was so odd lol and a huge mountain of lettuce on my plate?! Like I said service was great by the waitress/bartender.   That was at 1pm, my stomach has been upset since and it hurts, so sorry I stopped by"}
{"text":"Worst customer service and most deceptive gaming machines. Typical a machine that states 1¢ is what's advertised but this location has minimum of 20¢ so small it's at bottom of the machine display. I cannot trust this establishment well as the food prices are high for this area. It's no wonder that you can count the people here with one hand. When I told the bartender that other gaming locations doesn't do that he told me I can go there. Good  advise and I am leaving."}
{"text":"This is my third time in Five Star Tavern. The staff has always gone above and beyond to make you feel as though it is \"your\" Bar. Today I wanted more than just a drink, unfortunately I was sadly disappointed. After looking at the menu and attempting to order a couple items the cook very apologetically told me the only food he had to make was burgers or chicken fingers. Don't have a full menu if you are not going have the food to cook! If I want a burger I can always go to Five Guys or In and Out!"}
