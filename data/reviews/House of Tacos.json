{"text":"Stopped by House of Tacos today for lunch based on the 5 star Yelp reviews.  The food was great and the service, by Marissa, was also excellent.  I loved the fish tacos; just the right heat and they have a nice salsa bar with guac and cilantro (there were many other items).  I very recommend stopping by for a beer, margarita and tacos."}
{"text":"Amazing food! The owner /manager had time to stop by and tell us about the different meats and sides. Gave samples. So yummy!"}
{"text":"Me and a buddy went for lunch on taco Tuesday and were not disappointed. The Al pastor, chicken, fish, and veggie tacos are 1.75 each on Tuesdays, which was a pleasant surprise. It's a bit bare, as you are served on a styrofoam take-out plate and have to load up all the tacos yourself (minus the meat) at the salsa bar during lunchtime. But as far as the taste and quality of the food goes, it was really great. Nice to have a new taco place just around the corner from my apartment!"}
{"text":"Really nice restaurant, I love the wall of drinks when you walk in. The food was amazing love the concept of street tacos, the hash tacos were very delicious as well as the cochinita pibil!!! Will for sure recommend this place if you're in Mill ave!!!!"}
{"text":"What a gem! Landed here for lunch today after driving home from work yesterday. Didn't even know they were here. Their tacos are delicious and management is AWESOME!! What sets them apart is you can buy their meat by the pound! Their tortillas, which are freshly made by the way, are phenomenal!! Their salsa bar, nom nom nom. Their meat, which is sourced from the farmers market every three days, is sooooo good. I would highly recommend this place as it won't disappoint. Welcome to Mill!! We're glad to have you H.O.T."}
{"text":"The location for tacos on mill ave is just Perfect. Apart from the location, the food was AMAZING!! Being a vegetarian, you can only have few option to NON at taco shops. This one my fellow beings has the perfect Vegetarian Taco! The seasoning is great to taste, which didn't over power the veggies, the cheese layer of the taco underneath added the finishing touch to each bite, topped of with some lemon. hmm just writing this made me want some taco's from here again."}
{"text":"Happy Taco Tuesday to me!! Decided to try this relatively new place on Mill Ave and the Tacos didn't disappoint. 

On a normal day the tacos would be an average of $2.50 each but on Tuesdays they're $1.75! Also be there before 6pm as it is happy hour and house margaritas are $4.50. However they weren't my favorite margs as they were mostly ice and too sweet/sugary. 

The tacos themselves were great! Be sure to use the salsa bar in the back to add all your salsa and sauces! I ordered 2 chicken and 2 Al Pastor tacos. In my opinion the chicken tacos were bland with not much taste or seasoning, but the Al Pastor more than made up for it! The Al Pastor was perfectly seasoned and the salsa makes it even better!"}
{"text":"I came here at 1:30 in the morning because I was hankering for a late night snack. Needless to say, I was not disappointed. I purchased an Asada Burrito at a reasonable price and what I got in return was nothing short of a masterpiece! Great food, friendly staff, and a place that has all around good vibes!"}
{"text":"Great food the hash tacos with asada and green chile was my favorite!  Server was friendly and fun to talk to.  I'm going back!"}
{"text":"Not bad. Price isn't bad for taco Tuesday. Were the tacos great? Eh, they were bad. I was just visiting Tempe, so not gonna make it my normal hang out, but if you want super casual and quick and not chipotle this is a good option ."}
{"text":"If there truly is something called love at first site. Well mine is with a taco from House of Tacos. Seriously by far the best taco experience on Mill Ave. Last night was my first night in. A group of us do Taco Tuesday's regularly. We tend to dine at the same spots but will venture out to something new. This place was not what I expected. A late night around 8 we decided to meet. The venue was busy with a couple tables still open so we got right in. We were immediately greeted and our drink orders were placed. The server went through the specials for the evening which included several $1.75 tacos listed from the menu. I settled for the carne asada which was not on special however only cost $3.00 each. I also ordered chips and salsa. Between my friends and I we had an order of all of the variety of tacos excluding veggie. You have the choice of flour or corn tortillas. Served warm loaded with meat. There is a bar that has all the fixing where you can add your favorite tacos. I was pleased with my tacos. The chips and salsa were slightly greasy but still had a great taste. The salsa's they offer taste good. My friends loved there food as well which included beans and flavored corn on the cob. 

I am impressed with the service. Every person who works there is friendly. The establishment is clean and trendy."}
{"text":"Love this place! The first time my sister and I came, we fell in love and came back 2 more times that same week because it was so good. The tacos come out fresh and hot (just tortilla and meat) and then they have a bar full of toppings so you can make them exactly how you want them. Absolutely obsessed with their creamy green sauce (idk what it's called)!!! Service has been really good too--the third time we went, they were out of horchata and my server compensated by making my half a quesadilla to a whole for no extra charge. So far all the different kinds of taco meats that I've tried have been amazing, the quesadillas are great, and my friend ordered carne asada fries that were to die for!! Definitely going to continue coming here."}
{"text":"When La Bocca screws up your family dinner ... House of Tacos saves the day with fast and friendly service. Great food! Skip waiting at La Bocca for food that never comes and go get happy at House of Tacos!!!"}
{"text":"Great place but they really need a lighted sign out front on building or awning . No one knows it's there!!!"}
{"text":"Great vibe and excellent food and service. Marissa took good care of our group w bar service. I frequent Mill Ave restaurants often and this will become a regular spot. Welcome to the neighborhood HOT."}
{"text":"this taco spot on mill ave. is pretty nice, its good prices and close to campus. They have 1.75 tacos for pork, chicken and veggie (the veggie is honestly gross LOL) but the pork and the chicken are bomb. 

They have a bar on the side with all the sauces and dressings for the tacos which is great so you can choose however much and whichever sauces/sides you want. 

When I went they played really nice modern country which could be a plus or minus for anyone but a plus for me haha."}
{"text":"This place has great tacos and a selection of other small plates. There is a nice topping bar in the back with a variety of salsas, pickles, and fresh veg. A good spot to have a drink and some noshes. My only complaint was that the margaritas were very sweet, but this neighborhood does cater to a younger student crowd."}
{"text":"We came here because the Yelp reviews were so good. It was mediocre. The food was pretty bland. The service was ok but we were the only table in there."}
{"text":"Great service and great tacos!  Ordered the chicken, barbacoa, asada and fish street tacos. Every taco was overflowing with meat and delicious.  Loved the fish taco!  If you like tacos check this place out."}
{"text":"Slow and somewhat unreliable sit-down service, but they have an awesome Taco Tuesday special. I emphatically recommend the fish tacos - simply incredible!"}
{"text":"Always in the mood for tacos!

I'm really picky on tacos and these satisfied me. They're made to order so they take a while for them to come to your table. I love it when it's fresh instead of leftover meat. 

I ordered half pound of asada and half pound of al pastor. These half pounds come with five tortillas each. It's plenty for one big size person for sure. I am a bigger fan of al pastor. 

Decor is ok. Service is good. It's a little warm on the inside though. They have a salsa bar which reminds me more of a fast food place. I think if it's a restaurant with servers, this should be provided to the tables. I had to go there multiple times to restock."}
{"text":"My New favorite spot for Taco Tuesday! 
$1.75 tacos  on Tuesdays

Way better portions than any other taco place on Mill I've been to yet!!! 

Decent salsa bar and my favorite part is pickled cabbage. 

Although I don't eat  my friends really liked the Pastor and Carne Asada, I enjoyed the fish, shrimp, and veggie tacos myself. And the veggie was really good  some places just use whatever they have veggie wise but they really seem like they put thought into making these taste amazing!

They're a little healthier as they do grilled fish and grilled shrimp but you also have the option for coconut shrimp  
You can also pick flour or corn tortillas. I can't wait to go back! 

It is a little hard to find since there's no big sign out just yet, but you'll see a small chalkboard sign off University on Mill Avenue that says H.O.T."}
{"text":"Food is what you would expect from a street taco truck, although the truck may have been better. I came here to try out the new taco spot on mill and if you're looking for a new spot to replace Fuzzy's or Loco on Tuesdays this probably isn't the place. Surprisingly the fresh chips were really good but they  didn't mention the price, the waiter/bartender made it seem complimentary. The tacos I got were not bad but I've had better on the same street, maybe I didn't get the right one, and I will hopefully give this place another shot in the future."}
{"text":"If ever in Tempe, AZ this is a must do food stop. Awesome, I mean awesome,  service. Great tacos, good beer selection and cheap!!
Chips/salsa, 3 tacos which I made into six, two beers=$20!
Ask for the shrimp (off menu). Fish was FABULOUS!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. The place is very clean and the waiter I had was extremely nice. Great vibes and music. I would definitely recommend it for lunch!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and was so disappointed in the service that I barely remember the food! We sat at the bar and the bartender didn't greet us for a.good 15 mins. He then brought us waters and I ordered a diet coke, which I never received. Our food came out what seemed like a centruy later [I got a burrito] and I was not impressed. We had to wait a really long time to get the check and at this point we were late going back to work. Probably will not come back here."}
{"text":"Came in on a Friday for the fish street tacos.  There are tables w menus on them as well as a self service area so confused by our first visit we went to the counter.  We were told we were more than welcome to grab a seat and our server would be right by. It's an ala carte menu so we decided to try a couple of street tacos.  My friend a fish and shrimp and side quesadillas and me a veggie taco w a veggie burrito! The burrito is a meal in itself and I absolutely loved the fresh flaky tortilla. Both our tacos were seasoned perfectly but my friend thought that the tacos being street tacos and small in size should be less expensive. 

They do have a happy hour that starts at 3pm and tacos go cheaper then we were told. Go check them out! They are open till 3am so anytime you need a taco fix I'd stop by!"}
{"text":"Pretty good tacos but horrible service. Was completely understaffed on taco Tuesday. Don't expect to get refills on drinks or to get your food anytime soon. That being said the food is pretty good in the salsa bar is a nice touch."}
{"text":"This is the real deal, great meat and original Mexican Tacos, corn tortillas are hand made. Super fast and warm service .  Loved it will be coming here very often!"}
{"text":"2 visits and I must say, Its pretty darn good.

Both times we got the build your own options where you order meat by the pound and get tortillas on the side. This option must come with rice and beans, they were tasty. The meat options are good 2 beef a pork, shrimp, and veggies, maybe a few I cant remember. The Carnitas are great! and I remember the Carne Asada was tasty as well. awesome salsa bar with great options to dress your tacos including shredded cabbage and chopped onions with some Pico and several salsa's. Today the only issue was the tortillas themselves, although warm they were very greasy, Very! They were promised toasted but arrived after a short bath in the fryer.

Full bar,  and friendly service round out many reasons to return!"}
{"text":"Great taco shop in downtown Tempe/Mill area. Food is really good I had fish tacos my date had the veggie burrito and we both enjoyed our meal. If youre in the area give them a try"}
{"text":"The food was good and so was the service, just slightly disappointed that they've items featured on their menu but because they're a new business they don't have them available yet, there was no horchata available either, it had ran out for the day. Hopefully all these advertised menu items will be available to the public soon."}
{"text":"Best tacos on mill. (Sorry fuzzy i still love you) handmade margaritas, none of that pre mixed crap. And OMG the carne asada. I've had a lot of tacos and I judge a place on their carne and I got to say this place is crave worthy. And they let you customize with an awesome salsa bar (try the habanero in top if you like spicy). Couldn't recommend this place more! One hash taco and one carne and I'm set."}
{"text":"If you're expecting good tacos, this is not the place for you. Ambience is cool and place is not bad to chill but my crave for tacos was not satisfied."}
{"text":"I am so happy this place exists. Mill was in desperate need of some authentic street tacos and this place delivers! It is inexpensive and delicious. I love that they have bottles Mexican sodas and horchata and jamaica. I got the carne asada and carnitas tacos and they were very tender and different than other tacos I have had before, but so good. I love this place and cannot wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Good service, good food, nice patio! I had the Southwestern Margarita which was extremely refreshing. I got the veggie, fish and shrimp tacos along with Elote. There was a topping/ salsa bar to top your tacos as you like which was perfect! Great food, glad I chose to stop in!"}
{"text":"We had to give them our order twice. And we still only got half of our food. Frankly, I'm embarrassed for them. Don't go here."}
{"text":"Where to start...

The tortillas are weak and store-bought, but you can't tell because they are awash with grease. I tried 3 different kinds: pastor, cochinita, and rasurado. They all tasted the same...and were bland and had a nasty, almost chemical aftertaste. People - pastor can be so much better than this!

Service was awesome and the salsa bar is pretty well stocked. Prices were fair. They had Odesza rocking on the speakers, so I'm giving an extra star.

I left here feeling pretty disappointed. The reviews had me convinced that this is taco Mecca...it isn't."}
{"text":"This place is awes-yummm. Food is badass. Put all ur toppings on urself. Load it up.  Bathroom was in need of love...but i went for tacos, not toilet."}
{"text":"HoT was the perfect addition to our time at the Tempe Arts Festival.  Their happy hour offered great pricing on street tacos and drinks.  Our server was very friendly, informative and polite.  The food tasted very fresh and every one of the different tacos we sampled was satisfying.  Highly recommended to anyone on Mill Ave. looking for some great Mexican food!"}
{"text":"The tacos are soooo good! Nice and cheap! Great happy hour specials that include food and drinks. Nice chill spot for meeting up with friends or just a solo dinner."}
{"text":"Easily the grossest, most low quality food and service I have ever had on Mill Ave. Was here at the Tempe Art Festival, thought I'd try it due to it being pretty new. Worst decision I have made. The portions are tiny. They charge you $6 for a Quesadilla the size of a street taco. The waiter forgot about our entire tables drink order, which are also over priced. $18 for a margarita?? Too greasy, tiny portions, over priced, and bad service. I'd rather go to Fuzzy Tacos."}
{"text":"I got the pork tacos and chips and salsa. They are the best tacos in Arizona! I can not believe they are only 2.50 each. So good! If you are around Tempe you have to try. The sauces are so good also! The staff is very sweet."}
{"text":"Came here for taco Tuesday and really enjoyed it. $1.75 for the chicken, al pastor, veggie, or fish tacos. My group ordered chicken and al pastor. Both were great but the al pastor was a real winner. The tacos come on your choice of flour or corn tortilla and you can customize it at their salsa bar that has a wide array of toppings. House margarita was great and only $4.50 but isn't listed on the menu. Chips and salsa available for $2 but I would skip those next time. This is definitely my new taco Tuesday place!"}
{"text":"Very reasonably priced tacos. Pretty darn good too. The atmosphere is also nice! Reason for only 4 stars is the service. Our waiter seemed truly displeased to be at work and was curt with our table at best."}
{"text":"Bad service, bad food, small portions, overpriced drinks, forgot our order. The waiter was rude and forgetful, the food comes with no silverware or plates. One taco was brought out cold and the food was brought out all at different times. Very unhappy."}
{"text":"You guys food is so good. I love the tacos and margaritas! I recommend the fish taco. I know you guys are new and hope you read this. I've been there 3 times and have seen people walk out you guys should have a sign that says \" Please Wait To be seated\" so they don't leave right away. Also not sure if you have one but Instagram is freee advertising basically! You can post food pictures and specials also pictures of your cool jarrito wall and you'll reach a younger audience since your accros from ASU. You call also advertise your Instagram at the restaurant so customers follow you"}
{"text":"They were quick and they were goood. We also had chips and guacamole, fr shyly made. The chips were the deep fried variety, orange and spicy. Not usually my thing but I enjoyed them."}
{"text":"Came here craving some tacos and handmade tortillas.  They had dollar tacos: pastor, veggie and chicken.  I ordered pastor and chicken along with chips and salsa.  Both were good, but the pastor was better.  I recommend going with the handmade flour tortillas.  The service was great and the people working here are great.  Really friendly, kind and genuine.  Solid place to get your taco fix.  I had a number of craft brews they had.  Solid place.  Enough said."}
{"text":"Best tacos in Phoenix!!!!!! Definitely a must, the meat is delicious not to forget that they make the best guacamole I have ever had."}
{"text":"I'm a couple weeks late writing my review, but here it is.  Decided on the House of Tacos as I had seen pics of their Jarritos wall.  We arrived shortly after they opened and were the only customers there.  Service was fast and the food came out very fast. The tacos did not disappoint and I liked that they bring you the basic meat and tortilla and you put what you want on them at the taco bar.  The taco bar had a good selection of items and salsas.  I also had the elote, which was most excellent.  LOVED the amount of lime on it."}
{"text":"Great tacos! Had a little of everything! Started with chips and sides from the condiments bar. Then had carnitas, asador, fish, barbacoa tacos. All were great. Loved the fish and carnitas. Then topped it off with asador fries. Kids had cheese quesadilla and steak quesadilla. Both were great! So unnecessary, but so good! And had a margarita to quench my thirst! Left stuffed. 

I'd say the only downfall was that they didn't have guacamole. Just guacamole sauce (which was ok substitute)."}
{"text":"Not sure how this place got 4.5 stars...definitely not worthy of that! You basically order some meat or fish on a plain taco and put your own toppings on from the topping bar.None of the toppings are even good (I.e. salsa, cabbage, onion, cilantro) the chicken was definitely in need of additional seasoning. Even salsa didn't make it taste any better. A little tiny cup of basic shredded cheese was extra. Ridiculous....this places makes the tacos I make at home seem like top chef status"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the tacos! Went earlier today for taco Tuesday! Great specials! However, I was not impressed with the service. Both the server and bartender working had attitudes. Neither greeted my boyfriend or I when we sat down, literally handed us menus, and asked for our I.D.s The bartender forgot to put in half of our order too. They never smiled nor when we left did they say bye. My margarita was ok, but watching the bartender pour short on my drink was a little disappointing. Great concept, great food, but the customer service needs to be stepped up a lot! I'm in the industry too and I just don't understand that kind of behavior! We work for tips!"}
{"text":"Great little stop on Mill Avenue for some fresh tacos and a beer. I had a grilled fish taco - little bit of spice on grilled tilapia; and a veggie taco - grilled squash, zucchini, and onions. Hubby had the al pastor and the taco haaz with gooey melted cheese. All four of the tacos were scrumptious on thick delicious corn tortillas. The salsa bar was adequate and the salsa served with the chips was very nice. The tortilla chips were underdone a bit - so watch out for that. The beer was pricy for a small lunch, but service was very friendly and efficient. The place was clean, the bathrooms were clean, and I'd revisit again."}
{"text":"First time here and I was super impressed! We had the carne asada and carnitas tacos and the meat was so moist and delicious. Great bang for your buck! We'll be back."}
