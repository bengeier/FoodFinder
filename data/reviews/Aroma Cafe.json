{"text":"Such a cute cafe. This is the kind of place I wouldn't mind coming to one morning with a book, sitting down with a cup of coffee, and reading for hours while drinking my way through a couple more cups and a muffin or pastry. Just wish it was closer to campus."}
{"text":"Didnt expect this little place would have such delicious coffee. Very smooth, Tastes good without needing to add a ton of sugar or syrup in."}
{"text":"Aroma is a charming coffee shop. I don't drink coffee so I can't judge on that. They have a nice selection of teas. Their yogurt and fruit cups are large and tasty. Not sure where they get their pastries from but I prefer Pekara's, which is next door. Their lunch is what I find to be the best. They serve large salads, all of which are very good. I really like their Caprese Chicken Wrap as well. I have also tried some of the other wraps which have never disappointed. The atmosphere is what I would want from a coffee shop. The staff currently is a group of people that tend to have very good customer service. The prices are reasonable and the wait is never long."}
{"text":"Good coffee, better than Espresso and Starbucks.  Seemed like nice atmosphere with possibility of tasty food, but was just there for a caffeine fix.  Will definitely go back again to try out some more stuff."}
{"text":"This is my favorite cafe in downtown Champaign, mainly because their food is so yummy. You can't go wrong with a hot sandwich and bowl of soup from Aroma. Service is quick and the employees are very nice. The AC is usually turned up, so make sure to bring warm clothing!"}
{"text":"Aroma is a great place to visit if you're on campus and need a space to work. There is a public parking deck a few blocks away, so it's in a convenient location for visitors. The employees are friendly. The food and drink are nothing special, but everything I tried was good. The wifi is free and works well."}
{"text":"Very personal and cozy place with friendly help. I really enjoyed the vibe here. The food was good and the Hot Cocoa was fresh made not from a package."}
{"text":"Best coffeehouse in town.  The barristas are cool, especially Nicole.  Their food is also great, especially the black-bean and corn quesadilla.  The salads and wraps are way better than Pekara and way cheaper too.  I wish they had more tables and more outlets and they've always got their A/C running on high, but other than that, this place rocks!"}
{"text":"Aroma is great!  Great service, coffee, food, music, atmosphere, and outdoor area!  Five stars!"}
{"text":"Aroma is tiny but mighty! The drinks are awesome. The best Chai I've ever had. The food-- codenamed \"Sexytoast\" -- looks really good, but we only got the hummus plate and it was fine. A light snack for two people with two drinks for $10? Not bad."}
{"text":"Super cute and cozy cafe. The coffee selection is generic with a few unique additions. The flavor board contain countless tasty favors. The bakery is pretty small, but contains good items. The cakes are pretty good; moist, fresh, and not too sweet. 

I tried the cappuccino with the toffee flavor and it was delicious. I could barely taste the espresso and the toffee flavor gave the coffee a very comforting aroma. Definitely coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Very cute cafe. Pretty good breakfast. Very good coffee. Very clean. Lots of two-person tables and five or six larger tables.  Good lighting and ambiance. Pretty warm at about 74 degrees I'd say. Free meters nearby on weekends and a pay parking lot about 100 yards away during week."}
{"text":"Every time we drive through Illinois we make it a point to stop here. Delicious food, extremely friendly staff and the best environment. Dog & vegetarian friendly! :)"}
{"text":"Great coffee and friendly staff! We went there after dinner so we didn't try any of the food, but maybe we will the next we are passing through town."}
{"text":"Just visited for the first time and had a super cheesy veggie quesadilla, it came with black bean and corn salsa, that was very fresh tasting .....and they also have good ice teas and yummy pastries."}
{"text":"Thank you Jerry for making my Decaf Cafe ' Latte one of the  best I have had in CU!   I will return to try out some of the good looking items on your menu!"}
{"text":"what i love most about aroma is the outdoor seating. perfect in the spring/summer/early fall with an iced latte and a good book. 
what i love the least about aroma is the chai tea latte. for some reason, i don't know if it was the chai or the soy milk, it just wasn't good! however, i have been pleased by their other lattes (regular and vanilla), yet haven't tried any other coffee drinks thus far.
i've also had their veggie wrap and grownup grilled cheese sandwich, which were both pretty good and worth getting again. the best i've had here is the mango salsa that comes with the sandwiches. don't know what it is, but i just love this stuff (i think because of it's simplicity). 
the space of aroma is ok...i've definitely had trouble getting seating inside because of the limited space, but usually it is okay.
also love that they occasionally have live music. i have only been once when there was, and it was a pretty good experience....
and overall, i've had okay experiences with the staff....nothing really to report about because there hasn't been anyone overly rude or overly friendly...just about what you'd expect from a place like this...."}
{"text":"Literally the best cafe I have had the privilege of experiencing. I'm a Champaign local, have tried all the other cafes downtown and by far Aroma is my favorite. You can't beat the atmosphere, great smiles from the staff, amazing music selection and drink options.

Some of the food can be a bit expensive, but once you bite into your first toasted Reuben or Cuban sandwich, it's totally worth it.

Their bagel special or their breakfast sandwiches  for breakfast/ brunch after a long night ( don't forget the coffee ) make Aroma a great place for breakfast too.

I've played board games, studied, worked remotely, met people to catch up etc. all at this little great cafe. Love it, sometimes I don't know where I'd be without a coffee of the day and a smile, and I know I'll find that everytime at Aroma."}
{"text":"Food, service and atmosphere are all well above average. 

I can only speak for their \"sexy toast\" and aroma salad, but their food is colorful, flavorful and downright impeccable for the price. Certainly a step above typical cafe meals. 

The cashiers and baristas have always been sweet, and always seem to be in a chipper mood. 

Their atmosphere is perfect for studying, reading, or simply grabbing a bite to eat and people-watching. The purple ambiance is comfortable, and the local artists' work on the walls (which are available for purchase) add a personal touch. 

One of my favorite spots in Aroma is the northwest corner: a relaxing nook with oversized chairs and a loveseat, perfect for reading."}
{"text":"My favorite place for coffee and lunch in Champaign. Love being served in ceramic mugs, their salads and fabulous and the staff is very friendly. Love the outdoor seating too!"}
{"text":"Aroma does have the best coffee in downtown Champaign and the space is nice."}
{"text":"My home away from home :-)  

I love the food, whether it's any of their sexy sandwiches or the turkey wrap, or one of the amazing desserts which are \"just right\"!  I love the very friendly and cool staff too, and I love the casual atmosphere in which you can get a huge cup of coffee and open your laptop, read, and do your work for as long as you feel like.  In my case, that usually means staying for hours and consuming two meals, it's that good.  I am still looking for a place like this in Chicago.

The only downside is the corrupt little ***hole that the city of Champaign is, which imagines itself to be downtown Chicago or Manhattan.  In other words, the biggest problem with this place is that you need to run out every two hours to feed the stupid meter.  But, of course, that's not Aroma's fault so they get 5 stars from me, and if you read my other reviews, you'll see that I don't give out stars that easily."}
{"text":"I quite like Aroma.  It's your typical cafe, but they have a fairly wide variety of menu items and you get a good deal with their daily specials.

They have lots of seating indoors (including some cushy chairs by a fireplace in the back), and something I especially appreciated was the abundance of outlets!  There's nothing more frustrating than getting to a cafe that either a) has wireless, but you gotta pay for it, or b) has free wireless, but only two outlets for the patrons to fight over.

After ordering my hummus plate, I grabbed a table by the wall, plugged myself in, connected to the free internet, and spent a nice evening relaxing....  at least that's what I would've liked to have said.  I was actually scrambling to finish an assignment before they closed up for the day, haha.  The warm pita bread and fresh, crisp cucumbers that came with the hummus was very tasty though =)

They have a bunch of outdoor seating out back as well for when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"I discovered this cafe when I had to kill some time in downtown Champaign while waiting for the nearby Champaign Library to open. My experience was great. The cafe is pleasant, with unique design and decorations. The barista/cashier made my visit. He was so nice and down to earth and was open to answering any questions about the menu to help me choose the drink I felt like. When I asked about their iced tea, he explained the Hippie Blend, saying it has a few herbal teas, one being chamomile. The price was cheap. I decided to try it and added peach flavor syrup for a little extra sweetness, which I don't think he charged me for. Until another customer came I had a good conversation with him and then brought my tea out to a cute little back patio. Definitely give this place a shot if you're in downtown Champaign."}
{"text":"Love this place! So yummy. Not a lot of space for large groups but it's a cute cafe to grab a bite or a yummy drink. I've been here twice. First time was while I was waiting for a train back to Chicago. Second time was a quick brunch with some friends. Food was great both times. Their Aroma Salad is so yummy - usually not a fan of those kind of salads (i'm in the basic kind, not fancy with nuts, etc.) but I enjoyed it a lot. Their mugs you get if you're drinking there are huge. Probably a better deal than a to-go cup but not sure what the actual measure is. Either way, if I'm ever in the area again, I'll probably stop here over any of the other cafes."}
{"text":"Cozy place. In the summer there is a nice outdoor patio in the back. It has become our favorite lunch and hangout place whenever I come to visit my college kid. Delicious soups, wraps, sandwiches and salad. Also great coffee. I am not much for flavored coffee, but their banana latte is really good."}
{"text":"This is my go to coffee shop. I love it here! The general manager is a real cool dude. I like the coffee, the lattes, the teas, it is all good here. I do go here solely for drinks, though. I have never eaten the food here. But I always get recommendations from other regular customers."}
{"text":"Wonderful, comfortably cheery atmosphere.  It's so warm and cozy to sit here on a winter night with a hot beverage and a book, or a cheese plate and Scrabble with my husband.  The drinks are wonderful; I haven't really had anything here I didn't like.  In addition to the usual coffee/tea concoctions, they have juices and a few alcoholic beverages.  The food is also quite good, unlike a lot of other coffee shops I've tried.  Try the quesadilla or the Aroma Salad.  Good music, too!  My only beef with them is that they close super-early in the evenings during semester break, meaning that those of us who actually LIVE here don't get to partake while the students are gone.  I would understand if Aroma were located closer to campus and got the vast majority of their business from college students, but every time I'm there, I see quite a few non-students, so I see no reason for them to close early."}
{"text":"update 5/8/09

Yuck to their pastries.  Every time I go here (not too often, but if Kopi is crowded or has rudely turned off their internet) their hours have changed.  Now the sign says \"For Now Hours\" so who knows what it will be next time?  They didn't have anything that looked that tempting, but I had a huge sweet tooth, and tried a brownie.  It was hard as a rock.  I should have taken it back, but I didn't because I would have had to sit their and drink my coffee anyway since I was given one of their tiny \"here\" cups (which probably wouldn't have taken me too long in reality).

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

update 11/15/2008:
I have dropped Aroma just an \"eh\" rating...

Cafe Kopi was horribly crowded, so I trudged back out into the cold and headed to Aroma.  There was a nice size table free, and it's much brighter in there (which I found jarring at first, but got used to it).  I ordered my standard \"Grande House Coffee\" and when asked \"for here or to go\" I said \"for here\" because I had planned to stay to do some homework.  Well she gave me my coffee in this tiny little mug.  I asked her, \"Is this a grande?\" and she looked at me, said yes, and showed me an even tinier mug for their smalls.  There was not 16 oz of hot coffee in that tea cup.  Barely 12 oz would be my guess.  They TOTALLY short change you on the \"for here\" cups, so I would recommend getting a \"to go\" cup even if you plan on staying.  Which is unfortunate when \"going green\" is the thing to do...  

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On an early Sunday right after moving to Champaign, I was wandering around the downtown area to see what was around, and stopped in here for a coffee and a muffin.  It's cute, there's lots of tables, free WiFi (although I didn't have my computer, I saw a couple of people with laptops out), and the people behind the counter were nice.  There's a comfy spot in the back with couches and chairs and a fireplace!  (not sure if it works though)  And they have an outdoor area as well.  The coffee was good, and if you buy one of their travel mugs, you get a discount every time you bring it in to get your coffee.  The hours are great for studying.  Overall: it's cute, and I can see myself heading back there in the future."}
{"text":"The coffee is okay. It isn't bad coffee. The staff is very friendly and answers questions politely. The seating isn't like your typical coffee shop. It has a nice fireplace in the back and for outdoor seating there is a cool-looking back patio to sit in. They have tons of outdoor seating. They are never as packed as Kopi and it is quieter than Kopi. My favorite drink to get here is the Italian cream soda with the many different flavors they offer. This place has a lot going for it, I wish I could say their coffee is amazing that is why I can't give it a higher rating. You should check this place out."}
{"text":"Can my review only be two words? Cobb Salad! Well, here's a few more words. Friendly efficient staff, warm atmosphere, and other good food. Coffee is pretty good, but I prefer my coffee from another spot. I'm also empress with the wraps. I guess, I really dig the food from time to time."}
{"text":"Nice charming Cafe in DT Champaign.

Black coffee is good. Not sure about their specialty drinks though, never tried it. 

Only knock against Aroma is that my wifi connection wouldn't work after 2 hrs, but other people's seem to work."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere for studying or relaxing. Prices are reasonable in my opinion. I got the Sienna Turkey Wrap for lunch on a Saturday. It is very large and comes w/ one side. This is a cold wrap, and it is very very good, with a combo of ingredients that make it stand out over other \"normal\" wraps.  I got the \"aroma salad\" as a side. It has goat cheese, nuts, berries and of course greens. This isn't what I usually like (nuts and berries in a salad), but it comes with house dressing, and it was very good as well. Total for the wrap and side (not including drink, as I got a free glass of water you pour yourself) was about $8. That's a good deal in my opinion, as 1/2 the wrap filled me up, and I'm a guy. It could easily be split between 2."}
{"text":"I would give Aroma more stars if I could!  Aroma has a great staff that greets you with a smile.  I noticed that the staff knew other costumers by name and asked them how their day was etc...nice to see that they value their costumers. You don't get that in other coffee shop in this area! 
  Every latte I've had from Aroma has been simply delicious and perfect to taste.  You should definitely try the cranberry and brie sexy toast!  It's taste like a slice of thanksgiving in your mouth...I crave it often! Also try their soups!  They always change up their soup menu, can't go wrong!
  One thing that I really enjoy about this spot is it's an older crowd not a ton of college kids that are camping out like Kopi so there's always a place for you to relax while you sip away on your coffee."}
{"text":"I can't believe it took me so long to come to Aroma Cafe... Cafe Kopi was just way too crowded today so I decided to give it a try. This is definitely a nice place, and I'll be back. Plenty of seating (including, I believe, a patio in the back), free wireless, nice decor and lighting, friendly staff: everything you need from a good coffee shop. They have food too (mostly sandwiches, salads etc): I tried their raspberry chipotle chicken salad, and it was pretty good."}
{"text":"Admittedly tried to go to Kopi first and was immediately turned away by the sign on the door that said NO WIFI ON WEEKENDS. Fine, fine...So off to Aroma we went and glad we landed here. It's not quite the cozy place Kopi seemed to be but the coffee is good and I like the fireplace area in the back near where we sat. Staff was also quite friendly even though it was pretty early on a Sunday morning. And oh yeah, they have wifi on the weekends. One thing they could cut back on is the muzak going in the background. Maybe the rest of the clientele like the slow jazz, dunno."}
{"text":"Excellent staff, delicious menu and great coffee. Cozy athmosphere and outlets everywhere! The only problem, hence 4 star, is they have horrible internet. I needed to leave countless times since I didn't have the internet connection."}
{"text":"I think Aroma Cafe has the best hot chocolate in the area.  To support this claim, I had a cup of cocoa here, two hours later went to another café to try their cocoa, and immediately returned to have another cup of cocoa here.  (I really need to watch my sugar intake.)

Nice place to study, great place for a study date.  There's an outdoor area too, but I have not checked it out."}
{"text":"By far, my favorite coffee place in town, and the food is always fantastic. My favorite is probably the smoked salmon wrap, but I also really like the grilled cheese with pesto paired with the soups they have.

My husband can be really picky when we're choosing a place to eat out, but I can almost always get him out to Aroma."}
{"text":"While in town killing time for 2 hours, I chose Aroma Cafe as my lunch/coffee hangout -- good choice. My turkey/cranberry wrap with side salad was delicious as was my hazelnut toffee latte. Nice place to hang out as well. Now if this town just had some decent free parking ..."}
{"text":"Very nice coffee shop and the scones are amazing here. Came here for breakfast And the variety is nice and tastes good I recommend it"}
{"text":"I moved here from the Bay Area, the second largest coffeehouse metropolis outside of possibly Seattle. My first week in town consisted primarily of the hunt for \"the right\" coffee shop where the words \"extra foamy\" meant the wet foam, not dry, to provide a perfect foundation for latte art. If you know latte, then you must know Cafe Aroma. The consistency from barista to barista is not the same, so I send a word of caution. I have my favorite latte rainmaker, and I ask him for his schedule so I can come when he's there. I'm serious. The owner also is there often, and he absolutely knows what he is doing when it comes to making the perfect latte. Things like this are too important to play with. Go straight to Cafe Aroma and save yourself $30 of bad experimentation at the other coffee shops in town."}
{"text":"I asked the staff what the best flavor was for the coffee (since they have so many), and they created me the most delicious thing ever. It was some kind of mocha toffee iced coffee, and I've been dreaming of it ever since I graduated and moved away from Champaign. 
Also, their mac and cheese is the bomb, even though you have to microwave it yourself."}
{"text":"Perfect! 
Food: Cuban sandwich (their version) x 2 one for moi and one for my daughter. Mine accompanied by fruit; hers accompanied by chips and salsa.
Drink: Peach Green Tea x 2 
Additional Drink: A kind of frappe (coconut flavored)
Dessert: tres leches cake.
Us: transplants from Miami, Florida ( just got here about a month ago). Although our first time at Aroma we had yelped before and found an excellent review about their Cuban sandwich. We love Champaign but miss Cuban food the most in particular Cuban sandwiches from: Mario's and Sergio's and well the 1000 other places you could easily get one and me really missing Cuban coffee which are pretty much loaded espressos made with a variety of beans but Bustelo.... Mmm the best! 
Aroma didn't disappoint their version of the Cuban very close to the Miami one. Everything else terrific. Added bonus: stroke up a conversation with Jerry, terrific guy, wearing a UF gator shirt, told him about our Cuban food and drink craving and ....dios mio! (My god) he appears with an espresso that brought me back to calle 8! (Look it up). Thanks Aroma you have a customer for life! Jerry is awesome and I am looking forward to many more delicious adventures at your cafe!"}
{"text":"I have changed my mind.  Aroma, you are my new favourite coffee shop in CU, and not just because you kept me full of coffee and happiness this weekend while I toiled over everything from Marx to historiography.  Your workers were ridiculously friendly, your huge ass coffee mugs were on point, and the Beef and Cheddar sandwich was sabroso.  You win."}
{"text":"If Aroma was closer to my house, I would spend a lot of time here. As it is, I'm kind of stuck at Panera, which is a tad more expensive and boring. I like the atmosphere, though in my 40s I could use a little more light. I like VERY much the make-your-own-omelette, the cheese quesadillas, the buttered toast, and the fruit tart. As for the cafe mocha, I've had better. The lemonade was nasty, and had a pretty dreadful aftertaste (funky sweetener?)  Service is okay, but could be a bit friendlier."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, comfortable atmosphere, decent music, good food, good coffee. Internet could be a bit better, but it isn't slower than what you get at other cafes anyway. You can't really ask for more. My favorite in Chambana."}
{"text":"Indeed delicious coffee. 

Had a large cappuccino and an chocolate croissant and both were 5star worthy."}
{"text":"Aroma has delicious coffee and comfortable seating.  There are big, overstuffed chairs inside.  In back, there is a pretty patio with tables in chairs.  Aroma's patio is adjacent to Pekara Bistro's patio.  So, you can get a latte from Aroma, a crepe from Pekara, and have an excellent Sunday afternoon lunch."}
{"text":"Nice quick downtown lunch spot.  Went there because they were included on my WILL Member Benefit card. I'd been there before for coffee - which is also good.

I had a cup (generous portion) of the Roasted Red Pepper Soup special and a Portobello toast - artfully assembled open face sandwich.  My companion had a cup of Jambalaya and turkey toast and a cup of tea.  

There were quite a few customers enjoying the cozy atmosphere and free WiFi."}
{"text":"This place is a regular stop when I'm traveling to Champaign. Their bakery items are delicious and the Aroma Salad is fresh and well constructed in both flavor and texture. Coffee is well crafted. Bathrooms are singles, so there is privacy. Outlets are fairly well distributed, so you've got likely access to power. There are lots of smaller tables and plenty of patrons eat alone in front of their laptops. You'll be in good company if you're looking to hang out awhile, sip good coffee, and grab something delicious to munch."}
{"text":"My rating's based on Champaign-Urbana coffee houses, not other cities. I mean of course Chicago or New York has MUCH better coffee houses than Aroma Cafe, but if you're in Champaign-Urbana Aroma Cafe is as good as it gets, at least coffee wise. 

Enviornment: 3.5/5, Drinks: 5/5

Their prices are insanely reasonable and they give out a generous discount for bringing your own cup. The quality of the beans is also very good, which rocks. While Cafe Kopi (the coffee house just a street away from Aroma Cafe) roasts very well too, they can't make drinks worth shit. They don't even know how to steam milk! I got a latte their once and the milk wasn't steamed, just warmed up with the steam wand. 

I also rate Aroma Cafe highly because their prep, the way they make the drinks, is very good. Aroma Cafe actually uses a manual grinder for their espresso drinks! It's amazing! :D Most places just put the group head into an automatic. 

Their back bar might need a tid bit of work but I mean I'm getting really picky. I just feel bad for the usual lone barista doing all of the work.

In any case, if you're in Champaign-Urbana and want a quality cup of coffee this is the place to go. Cafe' Paradiso's just too expensive and every other coffe house has no idea what their doing."}
{"text":"Staffs are always so welcoming and friendly! Delicious chai latte and colorful/bright walls make me happy :) Best cafe ever!"}
{"text":"This is the perfect place to grab a fantastic cup of coffee and do some work or just relax. It always smells amazing with the pleasant combination of coffee and the variety of different foods from the bakery that they have to offer. It just adds to the great atmosphere that Aroma Cafe has. I can't say enough good things about this place. It's definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"I have to say that I have perused many different cafes in the area but none own my heart in the way Aroma does. For one, the food and drinks here are excellent -- especially the wraps and the teas, though the hot chocolate is also top notch. Secondly, the atmosphere is bright and inviting but also calm enough to be an effective study place. It's typically got people but it's never overly busy or loud, which is a big plus and their WiFi works pretty well. Thirdly, what really does it for me, is that baristas are all incredibly friendly and kind. I have had lots of little conversations with them and they are always polite and courteous. Once I came in rather worn out from a long day of finals studying and the barista made me a beautiful intricate cup of hot chocolate. That's the kind of excellent and caring service that this cafe provides and that I appreciate."}
{"text":"My favorite coffee shop in Champaign. They make THE BEST coffee. I usually have the double cafecito-- I highly recommend it if you like a strong coffee. As for the food, I have yet to try something I don't like. The staff is very friendly and cool."}
{"text":"Under new ownership, Aroma is re-inventing herself as a cozy alternative in downtown Champaign.  Warm byzantium hues fit perfectly with the charm of the new  'sexy toast' creations with fillings that range from fresh roasted portobellos with charred red capsicum to wonderfully tender beef short-ribs with a delicate horseradish cream sauce.  Understated Middle-Eastern sides like hummus and tabouleh further enhance a menu that still includes classic Aroma fare like the Cuban sandwich and quesadillas.

Aroma has come a long way in a short time.  I look forward to future encounters."}
{"text":"This has got to be the BEST staff I have ever encountered at a cafe-style restaurant. They are beyond nice and helpful, always giving compliments and lots of smiles. They are happy to help you make a decision and tell you all about the different types of coffee and food options! So wonderful and will brighten your day. 

Next, the food and drinks are so delicious and extremely well priced for the large portions. They have plenty of healthy and vegetarian options, which can be hard to find these days. The coffee is so delicious and they even offer refills on certain drinks. 

I am so impressed with Aroma and LOVE everything about it."}
{"text":"On a quick weekend road trip to CU, I wanted a local coffee shop downtown--and Yelp definitely delivered with all the recommendations for Aroma Cafe!

This is a cute little shop nestled in the adorable downtown Champaign area, and on a Sunday morning, it was easy to get in and quickly get a drink and some breakfast. It's mostly street parking, but I found lots of spots right out front.

The lovely lady working welcomed us right away, and she was very helpful with her suggestions. I decided on a large light roast Ethiopian and an oatmeal, and the Mister got a large dark roast of some sort and a cinnamon roll as big as my head. 

The ceramic coffee mugs were huge, and the coffee was delicious. They even had organic cane syrup to sweeten it! My oatmeal was pre-packaged, but it was one of the healthier brands without anything artificial or tons of sugar. The Mister loved his goodies as well.

The interior of Aroma Cafe is very cozy, but we decided to sit on the patio out back. It felt secret garden-ish, and it was the perfect setting for a lazy Sunday breakfast. 

If you're in the CU area, then you should totally check out this place. Friendly people, good coffee, and tasty treats... what else could you want?"}
{"text":"Not only is the coffee delicious and the food amazing, the people who work there are so friendly. Discovered this place on the 2nd day of my trip and went everyday after that!"}
{"text":"I came to Aroma to have lunch and study. A failure on both counts.

I ordered a surprisingly small amount of food for about 8 dollars. The quality was meh, and I had to order more to get full. If I'm going to spend 10-12 dollars on lunch, I can have much more satisfying experiences elsewhere.

Studying was difficult. The embarrassing light jazz track that they were playing was way too loud, and much more appropriate for, say, a hotel lobby than a downtown cafe."}
{"text":"A fantastic iced Americano at a reasonable price, served by a friendly person, and sipped in a clean and well-lit room where outlets were available in the early morning guaranteed that I could re-write that paper before presenting it.

Even the bathroom is lovely.

May we meet again, Aroma."}
{"text":"I've been very faithful to Cafe Kopi over the years - however - my beloved chai latte and chai bomb are consistently inconsistent. I decided to give Aroma a try after my last disappointing latte and I was very pleased. My son also prefers the hot chocolate here as well. I recently discovered their hummus which comes with plenty of flatbread and house made fattoush. It is sinfully delish. Unfortunately for me (and my coworkers) it is dragon breath inducing with all the fantastic ingredients. 

Their lobster bisque is also to die for. Maybe not that serious, but it's worth a try. The fresh grilled ciabatta that comes with it is perfect.

Now I'm hungry. Thanks, Yelp."}
{"text":"OMG!!! I am drinking a sugar free carmel cider and it is AMAZING!!! It's like a carmel apple in a cup!!!! GET IT NOW!!"}
{"text":"Super nice and hard working employee behind the counter. My tea latte was great and I was very excited to find almond milk in the Midwest. The hashbrowns were bigger than expected and crispy and delicious. The cheese on the egg and cheese was average, but the ciabatta was awesome. We received hot sauce instead of ketchup but that turned out to be great anyway! The coffee was above average and a generous portion for the price."}
{"text":"This place has the best café con leche. My daughter and I enjoyed the delicious food as well. Super relaxing atmosphere!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere and food are much, much nicer than Cafe Kopi's... but the coffee is not! The coffee menu is limited and the baristas don't know how to make anything that's not explicitly on the menu (that's cool because this should not be expected of them, but it's just a major downside).

I asked if they made cold brew and they offered me hot espresso on ice. That worries me. 

The food is very basic, low-involvement, no special ingredients, yet pricey. 

Also worth mentioning, the WiFi is abhorrent. Connection is too weak in all areas of the restaurant to even display text. And your session expires after a few hours and you are not able to start a second one. Just a heads up for people who want to stay and study. I don't know if it was a purposeful way to boot campers out. I've never had this happen to me at a cafe. 

Finally, the background music is awful, in my opinion. They play nonstop 80s pop: Cyndi Lauper, Michael Jackson, Olivia Newton-John, etc. So bring headphones if you're not into that."}
{"text":"They changed their recipe for their scones and that made me very sad.  I'm not a fan of the new style of scones."}
{"text":"I've been to Aroma twice now and can say nothing but great things. The staff is kind and helpful- especially as I'm very indecisive when it comes to picking food. 

I had the egg and cheese breakfast sandwich and hash browns, along with a white chocolate raspberry coffee with almond milk. The coffee was a recommendation from their specials board. It was sweet, without having an empowering taste of raspberry. Their breakfast sandwich is cheesy gooey, and paired up with a nicely toasted ciabatta. 

The environment is quiet and warm. I have loved sitting there and just doing work. Definitely one of my favorite places in town."}
{"text":"A classic downtown college eatery/coffee shop of excellent experience. This is another great U of I coffee land hangout. I got lucky the day I went and found parking right across the place, but I imagine it may be difficult to get to this place at times. The service and decor was great and coffee expectedly awesome as well. This place seems to be right up there with Kofi and other rival indie coffee houses and this is pretty much what a coffee house should look and be as."}
{"text":"On my quarterly-ish trips up to Champaign to see a friend, we usually find ourselves downtown walking around. This past weekend we had some time to kill before lunch so we stopped in Aroma for a drink. It was a gorgeous Saturday so we were able to take advantage of their backyard patio. It's pretty much your average coffee shop, but a few things stand out. 

One - they have sugar free almond syrup. Yum! It's one of my favorite flavors, but rarely do I find it in the sugar free variety. Two - they have a fireplace. I'm assuming it works, although I've never actually been in Aroma when it's on. Third - they have a nice patio. Although I really wish they would upgrade their patio chairs. They have the flimsy plastic kind that suck. Spend a few more bucks and get something similar to your neighbor, Pekara.

Their bakery case never looks too appealing. I'd skip on over to Pekara if you're looking for a nosh, but Aroma is a-ok for a coffee or tea."}
{"text":"Trendy,Youthful,Vibrant and Tasty.This place got everything to be successful and think they might be.Ordered  a latte myself and americano for buddy and they were pretty good.

{"text":"Aroma is my cappuccino stop on a sunny Sunday afternoon walk. Which makes me neither a laptop-toting regular, nor a complete one-timer. The caps are usually good -- until last Sunday. The tired guy behind the counter was in a big hurry to get on with his life, apparently, because instead of a cappuccino, he made a latte. The other guy behind the counter practically argued with me when I explained the drink was \"wrong\" simply by the sheer weight of the cup. Finally, they redid it, but it was still the worst cappuccino I have ever had there.

The atmosphere is nice, and food is not bad. However, the snack selection is practically non-existent. For that, you gotta hit Pekara next door.

Odd Aroma Cafe story: one Sunday, I ask for a San Pellegrino. The tall kid behind the counter says he can't serve it to me. \"Why?\" I ask. \"Because I'm under-age\" comes the answer. Wooot! You gotta be kidding, kid. After picking myself up off the floor, I explain it's fizzy water, he asks someone for help, I get the bottle (no brown paper bag) and we get outta there. And with this story, I just realized I am one step closer to the yuppies I'd always mocked. Well, I will suck it up."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Free Wi-Fi, great array of tables/chairs/couches, fireplace, outdoor space in the back, nice ambiance, and great friendly service.

While they play music on the overhead speakers, it's not intrusive at all.

They make a fabulous latte (hot or iced) and I am liking their updated lunch menu a lot. This is my go-to for coffee and a nice, relaxing place to sit."}
{"text":"This is a very average cafe with coffee that tastes like a hotel blend.  The coffee probably deserves 1 star but the chai latte drink was great and the service couldn't have been friendlier.  Nice atmosphere and great location near park.  But the actual coffee needs help."}
{"text":"The custom-made my chai tea latte without any sweetener and it was the best I've ever had.  I got to hang out for 2-1/2 hours to do work while traveling and felt welcome the entire time.  Good tunes at a good volume and nice place to work and drink chai."}
{"text":"This cafe is wonderful!  The atmosphere is bright and cheery, the coffee is wonderful (especially the iced soy mocha), and the staff is always super courteous.  There is a nice patio in back to enjoy outside seating and there is always great art on the walls:)"}
{"text":"This is a cute little coffee shop which I visit often and am absolutely in love with. The coffee is great and along with a lovely ambiance with ample outdoor seating in the form of a beautiful back patio, it's absolutely my happy place."}
{"text":"Local art, fresh tea and coffee, tables for typing things on a laptop, and more spacious seating area toward the back of the shop which features a cozy hearth. A great destination for a bite to eat, writing emails, and/or meeting friends."}
{"text":"Love the Aroma family!! Great food drinks and people!! Breakfast food all day! The pastries ad food special are top notch!!"}
{"text":"I love Aroma - the food, the staff, the music, the atmosphere. Everything is great!

Excellent for getting coffee with friends or studying in a group or alone. 

The coffee is so good. The soups are delicious and comforting - especially in the winter! I usually get the sienna turkey wrap - it's my favorite thing here."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's so pretty, coffee can be better, but it's decent enough. They got good food and awesome yogurt too. and I like people who work there too."}
{"text":"Stopped in today because it was warm and I was dying for an iced coffee. I ordered an iced latte with vanilla and hazelnut, made with almond milk. Most places seem put out by my \"complicated\" order, which is really not that complicated, but no issues here. The drink was delicious and hit the spot. My husband ordered an iced vanilla latte and had the same reaction as I did - tasty lattes and wish we lived closer so we could come by more often."}
{"text":"Another great downtown coffee shop. They have a nice outdoor patio and a cozy section in the back with couches and armchairs. They also have local musicians play some nights which can be quite enjoyable. The coffee and atmosphere are pretty good. Seating can be a little sparse and when it's crowded, it can be a bit hard to move around.

I don't have any complaints really, but Aroma doesn't quite have the draw for me that other downtown coffee shops have."}
{"text":"A really chic café to chill and enjoy some good food and coffee. The staff were really nice and helpful with recommendations. I ended up getting the mocha and pesto grilled cheese sandwich with chicken - both were great. My only complaint is that the wifi is a bit slow, but I do plan on returning again."}
{"text":"I worked at Aroma Cafe, on Neil between Park and University, for 2 1/2 years, so I can safely say that I've eaten just about anything that could come out of their kitchen. It's not amazing, but it's all good stuff. The kids quesadilla is the best deal on the menu. There's front and back patio seating, which can be important as seating indoors fills up quickly when school is in session. They have music Thursday nights which can be very hit or miss."}
{"text":"Amazing good here everything. Having usual 2 shots expresso, pour over readymade coffee w lots honey, smoked salmon wrap, tomato bisque soup. Wow. Live music tonight is nice. Will absolutely return."}
{"text":"This is the best coffee place in Champaign. Both the coffee and the service are excellent. They also do a nice line in baked goods, so it's a great place to get a break and a snack - plenty of seating, so you can work here on the free wifi while you munch on your scone and sip your Americano (by the way, it didn't take the staff long to know exactly what I was going to ask for)."}
{"text":"Great drinks and a wonderful atmosphere.  A very chic look combined with comfy seating.  Their food is so-so, but reasonably priced nonetheless.  Aroma is definitely my favorite Champaign cafe."}
{"text":"It features a retro style internet connection and a playlist of annoying pop songs. Coffee is just average. Wouldn't recommend this place as a good study place."}
{"text":"What a lovely place to get overpriced coffee!

I thought I was in Champaign not Chicago!?

I don't get why everything around here is so expensive. I got a small coffee to go and a slice of banana bread. I think it was from next store at Pekara (menu said \"baked goods from a local bakery). It doesn't get more local than right next store! I will say the coffee was great! This seems like a local sandwich and soup place that twenty and thirty somethings visit frequently. I won't be one of them, but a nice little spot nonetheless!

You must be a hipster doofus, barista, or bum who writes poetry to work or dine here to feel comfortable. I hate the coffee house culture where you just sit back and steal WiFi. Maybe that is why they are so expensive?

I would come back for the coffee but not if I see a Dunkin Donuts first! I also had to help the cashier do some math with my change...but I ended up giving her all of it anyways. Nice staff!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed breakfast at this little cafe. Pretty quiet and not overrun by other college students like other cafes tend to be. Spacious enough for studying, but still homey. The staff was super nice, and service was super prompt. 

A friend and I got dirty chais. Promptly were asked if we want whole milk or a substitute which was great since I'm lactose intolerant. The chai was served hot and tasted great. Not to sweet and not too bitter.

The yogurt and fresh fruit are served in prepackaged cups, but the sandwiches come out hot. The server was even nice enough to ask if I was okay to eat cheese since I asked for a non-dairy substitute in my drink. The fruit tarts are to die for, and though the hash browns and sandwich are nothing spectacular they were good, and a fair price. I would definitely come back to try more desserts. Their tea is also phenomenal!"}
{"text":"I stood in line for several minutes waiting on two big groups to order. These two kids came in after me. The guy at the counter (who obviously knew the two kids) helped them ahead of me. When they finally helped me, I said \"I think I'll go someplace else. You all just took care of those two who came in after me and I've been waiting.\" Instead of trying to make it right, the two people at the counter very rudely said \"oh sorry.\"  It's one thing (completely unacceptable) to let your friends cut in line at a place of business, and something much worse to be rude to the customer who wasn't helped. I won't be back. 

The manager called and was very kind. Thank you!"}
{"text":"The best part about Aroma Cafe are the people who work here. It is so down to earth, you will always have a great conversation with the staff behind the counter. It's clean, easy to do homework at, great music, and they have awesome baked goods and lattes. Such great customer service!!"}
{"text":"Quite good coffee, good ambiance, and the staff are attentive. My favorite downtown Champaign coffee shop."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere, delicious coffee and lattes, and the service is great. Cafe aroma is a much better option than cafe kopi, which is not as clean and always much more crowded."}
{"text":"My first time here, my husband has been here before, and we both really enjoyed our lunch! I had a Reuben sandwich with chips and salsa, and my husband had the cheesy beef and bacon with turkey -chili- pineapple soup. We also split a chocolate muffin. All was very good!! Very friendly staff, and clean! We will be returning again!"}
{"text":"This place is considerably better than Pekara's by at least 1000%. When you first walk into the door, the smooth and sweet aroma of coffee and bakery treats welcome you in every single way-- along with the workers welcoming you as well of course.  A must go place for anyone who just wants a place to relax and chill."}
{"text":"This cafe is usually crowded, and for good reason.  It's got a great ambiance, it's comfortable, the food and drinks are good, the baristas know what they're doing, and it's in a great location in downtown Champaign.  The menu has more \"real\" food than most coffeeshops, including hummus and cheese plates, as well as a very tempting selection of sweets.  The Chai is delicious, but vegans beware, Big Train brand chai contains milk powder (as I learned from a helpful barista here).  Of course, there is free Wifi.  In a city of comfy coffee shops, this one is a great recent addition."}
{"text":"Coffee is pretty good, the staff is great.  They have stamp-cards with a stamp that looks like a football, but its actually a coffee bean!!!!!!!!!  I go here everyday."}
{"text":"Great customer service! The barista was really pleasant and inviting. He combined two bags of tea to create what I wanted, and seemed happy to do it. Casual ambience and I liked that there was a couch in the back. My tea was great and I got a lot of it for just $2... I'll definitely be returning. :)"}
{"text":"+ Small little college town coffee shop feel
+ Good quality coffee
+ Cake balls........oh my goodness

Aroma Cafe is exactly the type of small business coffee shop that I love to support. It's warm and welcoming - cozy enough for setting up a work station for an afternoon, or just for stopping in for a coffee to go. I appreciated the friendly service and the selection of quality brews they had to offer. You just can't beat iced coffee that is made to order, freshly brewed on the spot rather than being served from a big pitcher of premade refrigerated coffee. 

I also had one of the lemon cake balls and oh good grief that was delicious! The center of the cake ball had something similar to a lemon curd, which was a very pleasant tart surprise. I want to come back just to get a few more (okay maybe like a dozen) of these naughty little bites!"}
{"text":"Cafe Aroma was a very pleasant place to kill time for a few hours. The food was good (I had a pesto and tomato grilled sandwich - yum!) and so was the coffee. The people were very nice. Seemed like a smaller seating area and less of a cozy atmosphere compared with Cafe Kopi around the corner. Otherwise the two were comparable and I could happily spend time in either one again."}
{"text":"I LOVE Aroma. This was the first coffee shop I found when I came to Champaign, and continues to be a go to when I want a great drink and beautiful seat on their back patio. Besides the dark memory of the sexy toast days a few years ago, the people here are always the friendliest and the environment is laid back and inviting. I don't usually go with coffee here, but it's solid. The iced teas are always tasty with a perfectly portioned flavor shot."}
{"text":"I practically live at this coffee shop. The atmosphere is usually quieter than Kopi, and there is plenty of seating on most days; the staff is friendly and polite and know their way around a kitchen. There are outlets all along the walls, and free wifi, if that's what you're looking for. 

*See edit*
I'm addicted to the vanilla chai, but I really go there for the raspberry white chocolate scones. I challenge you to find a better scone in the world! Okay, well, maybe not the world, but they trump any pastry in every coffee shop I've ever visited. When I've been on the road, this is the first place I come back to. Aroma is home!

Also, the salsa here is amazing. It is house-made and there are two kinds: try the one with the peaches. I get it as a side with my cheese quesadilla, which is also tasty and totally worth spending my lunch money on!

Edit: 5/20/2012
Since I last reviewed Aroma, it has gone through a lot of changes, including new ownership. What's bad about this is they took away almost every single thing I loved. Those unparalleled raspberry white chocolate scones? Gone. Now they serve bloated English scones from Sweet Indulgences that are as dry and tasteless as the Sahara. Massive, extraordinary fail. I mean, there used to be epic Scone Wars over Aroma's scones--I used to try to beat these elderly ladies who worked downtown to the cafe to get my share. For real. Now the new scones just sit on a plate, untouched and unwanted, fat blobs of loathing. Anybody who likes them never had the original, heavenly scones of old. They're not even in the same category of pastry, I tell you. They offer other pastries from Sweet Indulgences, too, but they're all really expensive and not what I would eat for breakfast. (Old habits die hard.) They still sell apple fritters, I guess.

They tried to get rid of my beloved chai, as well, but then the new baristas were too mentally challenged to make bagged chai tea and they had to revert back to the mix. I guess leaving a tea bag in a cup of steamed milk requires too much comprehension. I'm glad for it, anyway, because if natural bagged chai is your thing, nobody in town is better than Kopi, which is just around the block. Competing against them is just a waste of time, so they're safer to keep the chai mix and go with what their customers already know and love.

Also, that amazing peach salsa? Yup, it's gone now, too. Forever. The whole menu has been revamped to have fancier, slightly healthier offering. I haven't been desperate enough to try any of their new food items except for the fruit salad, which is basically a bowl of chopped fruit with a yummy syrup over it, and that was good, but it was just for breakfast. I will say they seem to have spared most of their old menu's wraps and other lunch items for the time being. The Wi-Fi is also password-protected now (\"sexytoast\" is the key). 

At least they didn't insert that proposed \"kid corner\" they threatened us with earlier during the revamp. That would've sent me running for the hills instantly. As someone who comes in here regularly to find quiet and write, I can tell you the very last thing I want is to share space with a corner of screaming, running toddlers. 

I deducted Aroma a star for all of this, but find it hard to give it less than 4 stars. I've been coming to Aroma for seven years, so I think of it as my home away from home, even if it currently is a shell of what it once was. Some of the other regular customers I used to see in here are thinning out. I guess all of this will make it easier for when I move from Champaign, because now it's just depressing."}
{"text":"Best coffee in Downtown Champaign. Better than Kopi, Expresso Royale and MUCH better than Pekara and Merry Anns. Coffees change daily, and they always have a pot ready regardless of the crowd. I always get a regular ol' coffee, but people who get the froofy drinks also think that Aroma is on top of their game.

The staff is always friendly and helpful to me, though some have told me they have experienced worse, but then again, I know a lot of assholes. 

The food is good, but their portions are a little small. A lunch with a large coffee is always $8-9. For $5.95 pretax, you get one of their sandwiches and moderately generous side of fruit salad, salad, or chips. They are cheaper than Pekara and Kopi. Make sure you check out their soup of the day, as they are always good and a soup and an Aroma sandwich combo is guaranteed to satisfy. 

They have pastries for sale, but I don't know why. The pastries at Pekara (next door) are way better. They also have a morning Bagel and Coffee deal for $3.50 that is pretty good: they have a bunch of different bagel and cream cheese varieties.

They also offer a discount if your work in Downtown Champaign, but they do not advertise this."}
{"text":"I was a bit disappointed by Aroma.  My iced mocha tasted like chocolate milk (was there half a shot in there, or what?) and the veggie wrap was only \"meh\" although it sounded really great on the menu.

My drink tasted alright, despite lacking any kick, but the price is really what made it bad.  For a SMALL espresso drink that didn't taste like it had any espresso in it, I paid $3.80.  Whaa?

I do like that the sandwiches and such come with a choice of side, and that none of the sides will cost you extra.  At Cafe Kopi, you have to pay extra for certain sides, including the side salad.  I liked the salad that came with my wrap, although there were a few pieces of wilted/gross lettuce.  I was underwhelmed by the wrap but would probably try a full-size salad from here.

However, since Cafe Kopi is right around the corner and serves way better drinks, I don't know if I'll ever bother giving Aroma Cafe a second chance."}
{"text":"In a time where hamburgers are cheaper than fresh greens aroma stands out offering a diverse menu of fresh food for a reasonable price. The light healthy taste of the food is paired perfectly with the open air well lit space. Aroma is a restraunt that is something the American people need in order to get our countrys economy, weight, and sense of community back on track. 

The menu was recently revamped. So if you havnt been here in 6 months give it another shot. 

My experience today was flawless. The atmosphere is upbeat, well lit, and friendly. The staff is friendly, personable, and knowledgable. The food was delivered to my table in a timely manner, presented with care, and was quality product. I will be coming here for lunch more often."}
{"text":"Friendly barista and cozy atmosphere! Got a hot chai latte and was very pleased - tasted creamy and rich."}
{"text":"Coffee and drinks here are good which is why I'm going to give them 3 stars, but their internet is HORRIBLE. Do not come here to do work because you won't even be able to access even google.com."}
{"text":"Okay ambience, but my latte tasted burnt and my chocolate croissant was terribly cakie -- instead of light, flaky, and buttery as croissants should be made.  My coffee perspective is based on enjoying wonderful cups of coffee from the following sample of establishments:

-  Anthology (Detroit, MI)
-  Avoca (Fort Worth, TX)
-  Counter Culture (Durham, NC)
-  Groundswell Coffee (Chicago, IL)
-  Intelligentsia (Chicago, IL)

{"text":"Awesome coffee and espresso drinks. I also love the Cuban pork sandwich. It was yummy. The staff is friendly and helpful. The place itself is cozy, bright, and warm. Next time I should bring something to read and just chill."}
{"text":"By chance I stopped in at Aroma as a lady was sitting outside the cafe and her food looked so yummy!

Inside the restaurant the walls are filled with art. Such a wonderful addition to the restaurant. But most excitingly, the food was sooo good! I had the combo of the caprese wrap with a Cobb salad. Very good prices for this quality and quantity of food. There was a half of an avocado on my salad! If I was in the area again, I would likely get the full salad rather than a combo.

The only thing I would wish they would work on is the time it took for me to receive my food. It was a bit long for a wrap and salad when the location was not very busy."}
{"text":"I like Aroma.  The coffee is nice, the pastries are delicious, the food is fantastic, and the space is big and welcoming. The seats by the window are a really nice touch.  The biggest problems I have with this place though is that the baristas are sometimes a little inattentive to customers and the temperature in there is always experiencing problems.

The other problem is that it's not the best space for collaborative work.  I'm happy to go there alone as a nice place to work quietly or read/ have sometime \"away\" but I rarely go there for when I need more table space."}
{"text":"I was pretty skeptical when I first tried the food here recently. The organization that owns Aroma, also owns the majority of other businesses in downtown Champaign and I've never really been a huge fan of the quality of the food at the other establishments. However, I can admit that for the price, the food here is really impressive! I'm not sure how much of it they actually make in house. When I asked about whether they made the cake pops in house, the barista chuckled and said \"They'd be twice the price if we did\" and then confessed that they buy them through a distributer. Nonetheless, the quality is good. The cake is moist, and the chocolate covering it is rich. I ordered the Chicken Caprese Wrap with a side salad which absolutely blew me away! Lots of great basil flavor and a balsamic vinaigrette seasoning. For the price, this has got to be the best cafe food downtown.

As for the chai latte? It was good. Its a powder mix and it's a little on the sweet side. Nothing super impressive but tolerable in the end."}
{"text":"*disclaimer* im writing this review on my memories from literally living in this place 5+ years ago. with that said......

i finished my college career at this place! in a year, i think i spent more time here than my own room!

their coffee is amazing... and the price is right for college students and those on a budget. their carb selection along with special menu items were always fresh.  :)

i do recall them having awesome salsas! i think i was about 3 americanos deep and needed to cleanse the coffee scum out of my mouth.. (eww, gross, sorry). they had a mango salsa special on the board and i have been making my mango salsa as they did ever since (or try to.. hehe).

i miss this place. it's small, cozy, the staff there were always friendly and their music selection was always on point!"}
{"text":"Try the a-latta bananas.  Delicious!!  I asked to hold back on the banana syrup, so it wouldn't be so overpowering.  The staff is very friendly!!  And if you purchase one of their travel mugs you get a drink free then get 20% any time you come back in with the cup!"}
{"text":"Before there was Aroma, I thought iced vanilla lattes were supposed to taste bitter and burnt (thank you Espresso Royale...).  Now I know they are supposed to be sweet, creamy, fragrant, and oh so good.  Aroma has some of the best coffee I've ever had (but it's definitely not cheap), as well as a variety of delicious real food.  Store is cute, with a nice patio out back, but it's not the biggest place and if you're looking for a place to study and it's after lunch, you'll probably be out of luck here.  Otherwise, it's one of my favorite places to camp out (provided I woke up early enough on a Saturday morning)."}
{"text":"Really great grub. I tried the turkey wrap and it was delish. Good flavored added in. I would definitely recommend if you want an early start they open at 7. But also great for lunch as well. If I was from here I would come eat here on a regular."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to study! Its off campus and always half full so I don't have a problem finding a seat. Their coffee is decent prices and I like how they put different artists work up around the shop and have a really nice outdoor seating area. I've been here lots of times and have never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"My co workers and I visit aroma daily- sometimes multiple times in one day! Our orders are large and usually fussy/complicated. They are sure to always greet us with a smile and get our big orders taken care of so quickly! Of course with ordering at the capacity and frequency that we do there has been a few miscommunications and they are always quick to fix or help which is always so great! Everyone there takes great care of us day in and day out and we are so happy that they are there!!"}
{"text":"This cafe warms my heart hah.  It's a nice quiet place, I've always had great service when I go. They have some small tables, some medium, a few couches and a spiffy fireplace. Very cozy. Cool place to study as well!

I've liked their lattes (I had a seasonal gingerbread latte which was yummy) and they have a variety of teas. Check it out!"}
{"text":"I walked here after visiting Cafe Kopi (it's a 2 minute walk away) on a Saturday morning around 11 a.m.

Aroma Cafe is smaller than Cafe Kopi and has an even more boring atmosphere (I also gave Cafe Kopi 3 stars). On the plus side, there is also a work/study atmosphere here at Aroma Cafe just like there was at Cafe Kopi.

I ordered the Peach Green Tea for here which came in a red mug on a saucer. I was given the mug with the tea bag still in it, which I appreciated, but wish I was also given a small spoon in order to fish it out once my tea is done steeping. Now the only options I have are: 1) leave the tea bag in there; 2) fish the tea bag out with my fingers; or reluctantly 3) I could go back up to the counter and ask for a spoon...but that's one extra trip too many.

My tea tasted fine...but nothing I will remember by the time I leave this shop. Even though I didn't really like Cafe Kopi either--it's still a step up from Aroma Cafe."}
{"text":"i hit Aroma at least once a day.  great coffee.  great staff.  what else could i want?"}
{"text":"Possibly the best coffee in town. The staff is sooo nice. I love the breakfast sandwiches. The atmosphere is great, I have never been there where I can't find a seat. Good for getting work done."}
{"text":"I want to give this place more stars, but when I really think about it, 3 stars fits my experience with Aroma Cafe. The atmosphere is cute, and I could easily see myself sitting at a table here wasting the day away studying. However, the lattes I have had here were just OK. They have boundless flavors to choose from, but the flavors that I have had were a little too sweet for my taste, a bit more like Starbucks-sweet than I would prefer. Additionally, although I have never ordered coffee from here, I had some of my friend's on my last visit, and it was nothing memorable. I may come back one day to try the food, but when it comes to coffee drinks, there are plenty of other places in Champaign-Urbana that I can go to."}
{"text":"The prices are overpriced! Everything within this cafe is over-priced!!!! It's so ridiculously high for a cup of coffee! Moreover, I ordered the chai tea latte and I literally still tasted the powered in the latte! The fact that they used a power form is beyond my comprehension.  Don't go to this place, it's not worth the money or the hassle.  The cashier gave part of my refund to the tip jar!?? what the hell!!! I am definitely not going here ever again and I advise that no one else go there!!!!! There are better cafes out there! There is a reason as to why this place is so empty!  Trust me and don't go there"}
{"text":"Jamarr makes your morning better. He knows most everyone's \"regular\" order that works downtown, although I usually tried whatever the recommended drink of the day was. Man is a genius with the combos. I've enjoyed multiple breakfasts (bacon egg croissant yum!) and lunches here in addition to the coffee.

One star removed due to stale pastries. It's nice that they have the offerings but Pekara's baked goods next door are much fresher."}
{"text":"There are lots of coffee spots downtown and I'll be honest when I say that I like them all. But I find myself at Aroma quite a bit. The coffee is tasty and the patio area is really nice in the warmer months. But in the winter, their soup is my jam, especially the tomato bisque. And unlike some other places in the area, you actually get more than a tiny cup of it so it really warms you up. Oh, and did I mention they can make banana white mochas? Yum."}
{"text":"This cafe was a very pleasant surprise for breakfast. Every item I tried was surprisingly good.

The organic coffee came in a huge mug, bigger than most soup cups and had a really nice smooth and only slightly bitter taste. If you enjoy Intelligensia I'm sure you'd enjoy this one as well. The Italian soda was pretty normal, using Da Vinci syrup.

Both the roast beef wrap and mango chicken wrap were fresh and light with a good mix of flavors. The cream cheese is from local sources which you can clearly taste from the first bite. The sides of salad and fruit were both fresh and flavorful.

I will definitely return here on my next trip downstate."}
