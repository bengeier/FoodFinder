{"text":"I had The vegetarian food. It was so great. The owner and the staff were so kind and welcoming."}
{"text":"I don't profess to be a connoisseur, but it's the best Ethiopian place I've eaten at - a bonus that it is so close! Wonderful food, staff are super friendly and welcoming. I've been back multiple times (usually early evening) and it's always satisfied. Staff will explain the dishes to you and make suggestions if you're not so familiar with the cuisine. They have a decent variety and it all tastes fantastic. The coffee ceremony is definitely worth partaking in too! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"It really is a great place to have Ethiopian cousins,an excellent good food which is suitable for all ,even for kids and a really beautiful hospitality so friendly and admirable.i would totally recommend it to anyone who wants to have a good Ethiopian experience."}
{"text":"The best Ethiopian food in Toronto! Amazing and welcoming staff...come as customer, leave as a friend.   Be sure to try the Coffee!"}
{"text":"First experience with Ethiopian cuisine.  Great people great food. Must try the special tea and meat and veggie plate."}
{"text":"I've visited Lucy's twice. The first time, the food & service was fantastic. The second time was horrible - The injera seemed like it was very old and you could feel the stale feel to it, the dishes were sub par and the service was horrible. (The first time, lucy served us...this time it was a much younger women). When we asked for injera, she simply told us they ran out of it and there was no more. I couldn't believe this as it was 9'ish and the restaurant was open until 2 am. So we walked out of the restaurant hungry after paying for 3 dishes.   We are avid fans of ethiopian cuisine  and have a lot of experience with this kind of food. We would never go back there nor recommend."}
{"text":"Tried Lucy Ethiopian last night.  Had the vegetarian platter which was simply amazing. While we were eating the owner came to us to present us the coffee beans she had been freshly roasting for our coffee.  When we're finished eating she brought the freshly ground and brewed coffee and popcorn to our table and in keeping with tradition she personally sat down with us and poured our coffee. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone.  I will definitely go back again and again."}
{"text":"Great cozy place for Ethiopian food. My bf and I are Ethiopian lovers, first time visiting this place. Kai wot was so tender and flavorful. Although they don't have enough choices for vegetarians"}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this place! This was our second time at Lucy's and it was just as good as we remembered, if not better!   The food is fantastic and the staff always go above and beyond to make us feel welcome!! Last time we went they opened the restaurant early so that we can celebrate our son's birthday!   Would definitely recommend and will definitely be heading back!"}
{"text":"If you can see through the decor, Wow. Great experience. We were looking for something a little different near our beaches locale. And read existing Yelp reviews for Lucy's Ethiopian. Well deserved. We had the meat sampler platter and extra veggies. Wonderful flavours. Great mix of textures, earthy and diverse flavours. Service was excellent. After the meal we were served coffee. And it was roasted on site, she brought the roasting beans to our table to experience the roasting aromas before grinding them and serving. How fun!  Wonderful experience. We will return soon. You should too."}
{"text":"Very good Ethiopian restaurant - I was unfamiliar with the neighbourhood and came in here only because I was tired of walking at 9 PM and hadn't eaten in hours. The server was a very nice young woman who couldn't have been much older than myself; it seems she was running the show entirely by herself at this hour of night, as she came out to show us our coffee beans as she was roasting them.  I came with a date who had never eaten Ethiopian before. I usually stick to vegetarian dishes when I go for Ethiopian food, but this night I decided to try kitfo - a mixture of raw lean beef and cottage cheese with spices. It was very delicious, tender and soft - they offer you extra pepper if you'd like, which I sprinkled liberally over my food - it cleared my sinuses quite a bit...  I don't remember what my boyfriend had; it was some mixture of beef and injera. It was also quite good. Also of note is that the water was unusually pure and clean tasting. The restaurant was a calm atmosphere, but offers some rather funky Ethiopian music at a pleasant volume. The other patrons all seemed to be Ethiopian or Eritrean themselves, and most only came in for a drink. They were familiar with the woman running the restaurant.  For $10 you can order an Ethiopian coffee ceremony, which includes a bowl of popcorn, some fancy incense (if you wish), and a strange-looking pot of delicious strong coffee with free refills and sugar on the side.  It was, needless to say, a great experience, and my boyfriend was impressed. Around 10:30 pm a group of men came in - one of them was the owner, who was very friendly and asked us how we felt about the food and service.  Cost for two entrées, a beer and the coffee ceremony was $38. We tipped generously. Will come back again."}
{"text":"We had the meat platter to share for two people. It was delicious and the price was very reasonable. Great choice if you want some authentic experience. A truly neighbourhood gem."}
{"text":"Great food for affordable prices and cute location ,clean and nice atmosphere,a must try!! I will definitely going back"}
{"text":"Just had a wonderful meal at Lucy's.   Felt like she was serving us in her home.   Very charming and delicious food.   We will be back.  highly recommend."}
{"text":"I always read reviews but have never written any but my experience at Lucy was so wonderful that I felt I have to spread the words about this great place. I am from US and visited my sister in Toronto. Being a huge Ethiopian food fan, I decided to take her family to try Ethiopian food. My family never had tried Ethiopian food. I have been to many places in US but never in Canada. I am so glad I picked this place for their first experience. The food was fantastic! The staff and even customers were super nice and friendly. The owner is Lucy and she and her daughter make all the foods and run the place. Very nice ladies. We ordered 8 foods, including the veggie and meat platters and everything was very tasty. They were playing Ethiopian music on a big screen TV and my family ended up joining a friendly customer who started dancing in the spirit of New Year's Eve. We truly had an amazing time there and I can't wait to go back to Toronto and visit this place again. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I came in on a Sunday late evening and although they were about to close I was treated welcome. Delicious food and very lovely people! :))"}
{"text":"We got some take out, the food is OK but the price is a little high. Portion size was quite small. I'm willing to pay a little more than the going rate for great Ethiopian food, but for this I can think of much better places at a much lower cost."}
{"text":"I've never had Ethiopian food but after dining at Lucy's, I'm such a fan!! Not only is the food amazing, but the family that runs it are so kind. We tried the meat platter for dinner and came back the next day for the veggie platter. The portion sizes are really generous and for the price of the meals. I could eat here every day of the week. I still have no idea what half of the food names are but each dish comes out delicious. We'll be back, probably tomorrow night!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, charming and friendly service. The food is made to order so it's not fast, but well worth waiting for. It's not an extensive menu, but we found a huge variety to share amongst 4 people. There are only half a dozen tables or so and I imagine service could be pretty slow when it's busy, but it's a pleasant atmosphere and dinner for 4 with 3 beers was under $80 before tip.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great place to be and it feels like home. I loved it and I highly recommend. Finger licking"}
{"text":"The taste is just wonderful. The waitress is so attentive. Nice and clean environment, very warm and cozy."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed our New Year's Eve dinner here. The menu is small, with only one option for vegetarians (the veggie platter with a big salad and a few items). We ordered the cooked beef, the lamb and one veggie platter. I can't remember the actual names for anything.   The food was absolutely delicious. The four of us didn't have a chance of finishing the food. And I tried. Hard!!! They also gave us a thin soup type thing (vegetarian) that she served on the injera at our table. I have no idea what it was, but it was fantastic.   The restaurant became quite lively, with many of the owner's friends sitting at the bar, blasting Ethiopian pop videos on YouTube on their big screen. It was pretty great. Booze was reasonably priced.   The atmosphere is very casual and friendly. It's a bit out of my way, but I would make the effort to visit again."}
{"text":"Good vegetarian food as expected.  This is the second time, we went to an Ethiopian restaurant, after visiting the first one in Kitchener, Ontario from where we accidentally got acquainted to Ethiopian cuisine, which is quite similar to Indian cuisine in taste and flavour. Injera, the Ethiopian roti (flat bread) is a blend between between an Indian Dosa and Indian roti and was as good as the one we had tasted in Kitchener. Shiro, a kind of thick soup like made of Chickpeas (equivalent to Indian Dal) was delicious. We had ordered a Vegetarian platter, where on an Injera are placed some lentils, onions, salad will suit any vegetarian very well. We ordered 2 Vegetarian platter plates and a bowl of Shiro, where asking for extra Injeras did not cost us any money, but overall we paid $38 amongst 5 of us, leaving some room for the dessert that we would be taking at Cafe Demetre. Overall recommendable restaurant, although parking would be an issue. Ambiance seemed to be old, but was amply made up by personal service."}
{"text":"Myself and four friends walked in after an impromptu decision against the McDonald's across the street. This quickly turned into one of the best food decisions we've made in a long time. Food and service was top notch. Owner came and made us feel very comfortable by entertaining our questions about what was good and I couldn't help but feel confident that the food would be great. And as predicted it was awesome! The four of us highly recommend this restaurant if you're  ever craving something new. You will not be dis?ùýappointed!"}
{"text":"Wonderful little Ethiopian spot on the Danforth. The restaurant decor is as welcoming as the host. The food was really good, and the coffee ceremony made all the difference."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night craaaaving some good Ethiopian food and I was taken care of! The wait staff is super friendly and helpful, and the food is to die for! They have a large tv and projection screen to watch as you eat. The atmosphere is so casual and awesome I was sad when I came back and it was a little too early so they were closed. Easily my favorite restaurant I've visited during my time in Toronto. They've made a fan out of me!!!"}
{"text":"CONSISTENTLY WONDERFUL SERVICE, YUMMY FRESH HOME COOKED LIKE MEAL AND FRIENDLY ATMOSPHERE. A few months later, we went back with a group of 12 friends and had another FANTASTIC meal.  This time, we had more of the yummy zilzil tibs as well as the chicken version of that same dish.  If there are at least four of you, you must try the entree (I forget the name) that has a little of everything.  The owner usually only offers that on weekends but she may accommodate you.  We had the lovely Ethiopian coffee ceremony this time where Hadas (the owner) roasted the coffee beans, bought it out to it to let us smell the fragrance and then she ground it.  Then she explained the significance of the coffee ceremony to us.  Great time had by all.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Don't let the outside of the building fool you, Lucy Ethiopian Kitchen is awesome! My boyfriend and I have been contemplating trying this place for a while, and I'm glad we did! We ordered the vegetarian platter and the lamb tibs (I forget what they call it on the menu). The vegetarian platter arrived with a good variety of dishes and we got to try a little of everything. I can't say what I liked most in the platter; everything was really delicious! The lamb tibs was also fantastic! For $13, we received a great amount of lamb with peppers and onions. The lamb was cooked perfectly and the flavours were amazing. This was the first time I have ever tried a meat dish at an Ethiopian restaurant, and it was a pleasant surprise. We will definitely go back again... I'd be interested in trying the kitfo next time!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at almost every big ethiopian resto in Toronto i.e. Addis Abbaba, Lalibela, Ethiopia House etc and while the service was very good here, the food was very mediocre.  Yes it was fresh and the serving sizes were good but that is the same everywhere.  The menu was a little limited and the selections that came with the mixed platters were not very inspiring.  It just wasn't nearly as tasty as the other places I've been.  This is nowhere near a 5 star ethiopian resto."}
{"text":"On my mama; I've never had food this good in such a long time!!! When I tell you EVERYTHING was seasoned perfectly. The onion & tomato salad was seasoned with vinegar that gave just enough kick to balance the tender, pepper lamb with sautéed onions. The injera was fresh, soft, and fluffy like a pancake. The presentation was stellar too; my lamb was served in an individual skillet still sizzling...the smell was incredible! This was my first meal that I only ate with my hands; I thoroughly enjoyed myself. Do yourself a favor and come check this charming restaurant out. It's perfect if you don't like big crowds; it has a mom & pop feel."}
{"text":"After seeing the rave reviews on google and yelp I was excited to give Lucy a try. Sadly, I was really disappointed in the quality of my takeaway. Although service was very nice, the mixed platter I ordered for $29 plus tax turned out to be very bland tasting. While the injera tasted nice, the tibs were just too dry, hard and chewy for me. Again, the green lentils and cabbage were bland tasting.   This was the first time I was asked how I would like the meat to be cooked so I just requested medium which is apparently most authentic. I don't know but im pretty sure overcooking meat is not medium well done so Im not sure why the beef was so dry and hard.   I am an avid lover of Ethiopian cuisine and to me this was well below the standards of African palace and the traditional fare available in Ottawa... and super expensive!   I would not go back or recommend."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Ethiopian food, and I love the Key Wat and Injara. All that being said, this place was amazing. My father and I went for a late lunch, and found that we were the only guests there, the owner was very nice and accomodating, the food was excellent and the owner was gracious enough to have the coffee ceremony with us when we were all done. A great experience and place that I would definitely recommend!!!"}
{"text":"I came here one evening with a couple of friends.  The waitress (I believe it was Lucy) was very friendly.  Both of my friends were vegetarians, and there was only veggie option on the menu.  We thought there would be more.    I had the lamb, which was really tasty (loved the sauce), but there were bones.  There was a pancake that came with everything.  I wasn't really a big fan of it myself.  I didn't care for the texture and didn't seem to have much flavour.    The kitchen was open late (until 12).  It seems like Lucy is the one that does both the cooking and serving.  It took a long time to get our bill afterwards (we had to go up to the bar and ask for it).    The music was pretty loud for a restaurant, though it seemed like more of a local hangout as there were people sitting at the small bar watching sports on the huge TV.    It seemed very authentic, just not my kind of food."}
{"text":"Amazing lamb! Very flavourful and tasty. The beef was ok, but it was too spicy for me. The veggies were ok.  The owner sat at our table and did a traditional coffee roasting, which was very cool to watch. The coffee is unfiltered and kind of reminded me of Balinese coffee. She was very friendly and educated us a bit about the Ethiopian culture.   I've been to other Ethiopian places before. The food is comparable, but their lamb is good! The only big difference is the owner was very personable and did a traditional coffee ceremony with us which was very unique. The prices were ok. I just wished we could order the platter on weekdays! It was hard to pick one plate because I wanted variety. A solid 3.5 in my books!"}
{"text":"Best Ethiopian food in the city!  friendly owner, amazing food, nice vibe, cool and friendly customers ranging from all over east Africa and Canada. Lots of food options for herbivores and carnivores and the bread is gluten free!  go there... you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Amazing Ethiopian food and very hospitable service.  Ordered the special meat & vegetable platter to get a taste of a variety of dishes.  Will be back for more!"}
{"text":"I've never had a restaurant experience quite like this in Toronto. Coffee ceremony was awesome and not to be missed. Service was exceptional and extremely genuine. The owner sat down with us for the coffee ceremony was very cool and exciting. Loved it."}
{"text":"Easily the best Ethiopian or Eritrean cuisine I've had in my life. Sample of 20 plus years including NYC, Boston and Toronto.  We are vegetarian and 3 of us had the veggie platter while our son had the Shuro. All dishes were exceptional and a tad bit spicier than the typical Ethiopian restaurant. The injera was moist and wonderful.  The restaurant is kind of small and located a bit east of the more crowded part of the Danforth. There is a Green P 2 blocks west for parking.   Service was warm and friendly.  All in all, an exceptional place."}
{"text":"I had a great meal at Lucy Ethiopian Kitchen for two, my girlfriend and I. We ordered the veggie combos and Cha Cha Tibes which gave us so many portions altogether on one big platter. The food was delicious and we couldn't finish it.  If you are looking for Ethiopian restaurant you definitely come here for the food first, and interestingly, the service second. Service is top notch!"}
{"text":"Lucy was lovely! I sat at the bar chatting with the owner (also lovely) whose name I assumed was Lucy... nope... she's (the restaurant) named after the famous Australopithecus!!!  One... I'm a science whore.  Two... Ethiopian is my favorite.  Three... the owner is so friendly and inviting.   So I was basically already 5 stars before even ordering. Anyway... I got Kitfo and Dulet. ALL THE MEAT!!!  Both were delicious, and the portions were more than ample... basically the Dulet was breakfast the next day. Everything was super fresh... and this was on a Monday night! She literally went back and made everything after I ordered... nothing was prepared. As for the flavors... among the best Ethiopian I've had.   I recommend Lucy 500%!  I'm the worst at remembering names, so I can't personally address you, but to the owner... AMESEGINALEHU!!!"}
{"text":"I first found Lucy's while looking for a place to eat after midnight with a friend (open until 2am). We stopped by around 1am and were so glad that we did. I've had plenty of Ethiopian food around the city but I have to say that Lucy's is now my hands down favorite. The prices are much better than what you get downtown, portions are better and I think that everything tastes much better as well. We got the combo platter and she even brought out an extra side pot of delicious lentals (I wish I could remember what they are called!) for us. Also, having someone serve you with a smile at 1am goes a long way in my book.  After having such a great experience with them the first time, I decided to take a group of friends there for NYE dinner. Again, we got combo platters and the food and service was great. None of my friends had tried Ethiopian before but they all loved it. Two combo platters, trays of injera and a side pot of extra lentals that more than fed 5 people cost $60. One combo platter easily feeds 2-3 people. The same amount of food costs much more downtown, isn't as delicious, and the service at  Lucy's is much better.   The place is small, maybe around 6-7 tables Full bar No credit or debit - cash only Open late - until 2am both nights I've gone Street parking Ethiopian breakfast menu also available.   I will absolutely be going to Lucy's when I want Ethiopian food."}
{"text":"Their 2pm-2am hours are kinda wild and we were able to get this spicy lamb and injera mixture at midnight and boy must I say did it really hit the spot. Great spicy flavor with a richness from the special butter they use in the dish."}
{"text":"Came here to try a new Ethiopian place. The place was small and the menu was simple and easy to understand. We decided to go for the meat and veggie platter, as it is recommended for 2 people and had a nice variety of food in it.   The presentation was great and I loved their plates! Unfortunately, as someone commented in an earlier review.. The meat was chewy and had quite a bit of bones in it. And most of the vegetarian sides were kind of bland. We've eaten at a few Ethiopian restaurants, so we have some experience with this cuisine. Unfortunately, the flavours were missing here.. I don't think I would come back here."}
{"text":"This is the best Ethiopian I've ever had. Granted I live in Detroit, a food desert where our only Ethiopian restaurant gets 2.5 stars on Yelp (mind you this is in Ann Arbor where all local restaurants are rated higher than they would be anywhere else). I thought the raw beef with cheese dish was amazing, and everything was tasty with some outstanding dishes in the mix (we ordered the vegetarian and meat platter). I would definitely come back the next time we're in Toronto. Good service and very reasonable prices. We did try the coffee ceremony, and while the novelty is pretty fun the first time, I doubt we'll do the whole thing again. It's not really worth the money in my opinion. Overall, definitely come and try this place, it's pretty awesome."}
{"text":"I think this restaurant needs to kick it up a few notches regarding their cleanliness.   The bathroom I went into was gross and had no soap.   We had initially intended to eat but I was turned off by the bathrooms so I figured we would just get coffee.   When we first got here there was a cloud of smoke from the incense that they burn during the coffee service. It is quite overpowering and the 3 of us smelled like that for the whole day. I didn't like that at all.   We ordered the coffee. For coffee it took quite sometime, but that was because they were roasting the beans! I thought that was pretty cool.   We got cups that were cold and wet, which led me to believe they had belonged to the guests before us who also had coffee service. Wondering if they were cleaned properly because they didn't go through a dishwasher.   Coffee service ($10) comes with popcorn, which is a nice touch, we were hungry after all, but the popcorn was in a knit bowl--the bowl was literally made of yarn. That doesn't seem too sanitary to me, and it's unlikely you can wash a bowl like that. How would you? Dishwasher? Laundry washing machine? I'm pretty sure that yarn bowl has seen hundreds of hands without passing through a method of cleaning.   If a restaurant grosses 3 people out so much they decide to get just coffee instead of eat food there, and even the coffee service grosses them out, then I think it's time to pick it up a bit.   I would've 1-starred it but the service was friendly. The coffee service was quite a neat experience where they roast the beans in front of you. They also burn incense which I thought was neat but I didn't like smelling like it afterwards. Would've been better to do something like that outside on a patio. The coffee itself was quite mediocre but the experience was interesting.  I really think they have the potential to do well, just gotta gravely increase their cleanliness standards. There is a level of cleanliness Toronto restaurant goers have come to expect and unfortunately this place doesn't make the cut."}
{"text":"If not the best Ethiopian restaurant I've been to, then at least top 2. We found this place on Yelp and decided to try it out. My bf and I were visiting Toronto, we make it a goal to try Ethiopian in the cities we visit, if available of course. We had the kitfo and the cha cha (lamb) tibs. Everything was amazing and fresh. Very high quality meat and it was extremely tasty. The injera was also very good, with a moist quality about it. I would go back to this place in a heartbeat. It was also affordable and the service was excellent. Saw a lot of people come in, and it seemed like almost everyone was a regular. The lady that seemed to be in charge knew everyone and made sure that they were happy at all times. I loved it and can't wait to go back next time I visit Toronto."}
{"text":"Delicious food and attentive, caring service. We came here on a Friday and even though the meat platter is only available on Saturdays, the lovely lady serving us was happy to provide it anyway! Fresh injera was also provided when we were running low. I particularly enjoyed the kitfo and the tibs! Looking forward to coming back here."}
{"text":"Yummy food. Both the vegetarian and meat dishes were so good. The tripe and tongue were great. My kids don't like hot spices so the chef made them a toned down dish they loved. She was very attentive .. Service rocked."}
{"text":"I'm from New Mexico and when I'm in Toronto visiting my family this restaurant is a priority.  Hadash, the owner is always so sweet!  The service is wonderful and friendly.  The food is delicious.  We always have meat or veggie platter.  Even my 2 year old Granddaughter loves this food.  I urge you to give it a try!"}
{"text":"Owner/staff was very attentive especially towards my kids. We wanted the meat platter which is supposed to be a weekend option but she was happy to oblige. Food was very tasty including the fresh salad with beets in the middle of the injera bread. Even my son, who I dub \"Mikey\", loved it. We were given extra injera when we were running low. At the end of the meal we were surprised with a popcorn treat! That pushed this place to the top of the list for my kids! I also think it's a fun place for families since you eat in communal style from the same plate.   The price I was charged was different from the menu but I figure it's too expensive to update the glossy pages. Not a big deal to me but it would be nice to know in advance.   Excellent service, great food... we'll be back!!"}
{"text":"On the lookout for vegetarian food we read rave reviews of this place.   Firstly, the location off Danforth is very small and a bit noisy with Ethiopian ethnic music.   There is a GreenP nearby for parking.   We ordered the vegetarian platter. Our server quickly recommended one for the three of us instead of our order of two.  We also were given Tachmino, which was the ingera rice pancake but in the form of rolls.   The dish was served on an ingera pancake in a giant plate to be eaten by hand, and by everyone sharing.  We had a choice of three vegetables and two lentils.   Service was quick and the place is very clean."}
{"text":"The food here was pretty good, but the service needs some real work. The owner was clearly entertaining family or friends when I visited, and for the first 5-10 mins I wasn't even given a menu or a glass of water. Afterwards, unless she was going to and from the back to get something for the family/friends table, I wasn't able to flag her down to order or get more water.   Sadly, due to this service I will not be coming back. Also, the lamb had way too many bones and had very little meat. But all the other dishes in the vegetable and meat platters were quite tasty.   Since Danforth has a plethora of good Ethiopian restaurants, I would recommend you give one of those a try. You're not missing much here."}
