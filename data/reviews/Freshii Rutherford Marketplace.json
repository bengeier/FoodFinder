{"text":"Thought I'll give this freshii a try after having a bad experience at a downtown store. However, the food is just as bad. I ordered their wrap and they try to stuff you with the tortilla - for the first 5 bites all I got was the tortilla. People can't eat \"healthy\" in Toronto thanks to places like this, \"eating out healthy\" means terrible and overpriced food. I'd rather have an Italian sandwich down the street."}
{"text":"I was here in March. I remember it being and clean and the food being quite tasty for being vegetarian. I don't know if I would again, since I'm not a vegetarian and omnivore restaurants usually some decent vegetarian option if I wish to go that route.  Everyone with me (4 or 5 others) enjoyed their food as well.  4.0 stars"}
{"text":"I ordered takeout salad and paid extra for extra veggies, $12 later at home, realized that the bowl was not even filled with minimal veggies, scarce greens and they even forgot the avocado which was a main ingredient. Disappointed that paying that much for a salad and getting only bits and pieces of what I paid for. Won't be going there again."}
{"text":"Friendly service, tasty, healthy food. Ordered the Oxaca rice bowl and added chicken for $2. Total came to about $12.   I enjoyed the bowl, however I would have preferred more chicken, especially paying an extra $2 for it. The avocado was very fresh, which was a nice plus. Everything here seemed to be available for an extra charge, which sucked. Extra spicy peanut sauce ($0.50) etc.   The interior of this Freshii location is awesome! I will try their terriyaki bowl next time."}
{"text":"Drove by one day and noticed a new Freshii opened up, I've only been to Freshii 2-3 times at the downtown location and it was pretty good so I decided to grab some lunch.   Outside looks like a regular store front, nothings special, just a typical Freshii, but once you step in its like a different world. You can tell they put a lot of time in decor and thinking about the layout of the store. Wood tables, small planters on the tables, they even have a small communal lounge area with a large wood table, and lounge chairs.   The store was very bright and vibrant, very welcoming, clean, organized, they even offer an array of sauces + condiments. Would def go back."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Freshii location by far. They've really worked to make the space warm and inviting so you actually want to sit down and dine in, rather than just taking your food to go. The staff was knowledgable and very patient while I contemplated my order. I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"I came to this location this week for takeout and the service was really good. The food was prepared really quickly and the employees were really nice. I ordered the Oaxaca bowl and it was really good. I subbed out the nuts to edamame so my salad would be gluten free. Just ask the employee which items can be used as a substitute at the same price point so they don't have to charge you extra.   All over I was really happy with my experience and the speed of service. The employees at this location were much better than the employees working at the location at highway 7 and Weston Road. At this location the staff were friendly, helpful and efficient.   I highly recommend this location. :)"}
{"text":"its a nice environment, but the food is kinda eh. it didnt blow me away, the fact that \"superfoods\" are so hyped up is probably why so many people are raving about freshii. way overpriced for something i could make at home.. also lacking in seasoning, and i got literally 5 cubes of chicken (which i paid extra for). Also, all items on the menu have basically the same ingredients, just with slight variations... definitely not worth my time or money."}
{"text":"First time here so wasn't really sure what to expect.  The atmosphere is great, I love their plant wall and seating arrangement.  Ordering is great, you can take their clipboard and check off how you build your bowl (add chicken, brown rice, veggies, sauce etc).  They have tons of great options that are included. You can make soup, bowls, wraps etc.  The total came up to 10.15 with tax, which is pretty reasonable.  It was surprisingly really filling. I ordered a bowl with brown rice, spicy peanut sauce, chicken, and 6 toppings (all included). I couldn't finish the bowl, it tasted great!  Altogether, would definitely come back here. It's reasonably priced and has lots of great options. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a healthy and affordable option that fills you up!"}
{"text":"Years ago Freshii at the Eaton Centre was a weekly ritual for me. Something healthy as I worked through yet another lunch.  Today I was at the Rutherford location and it is lovely, clean and bright. The service was a bit disorganized initially.  I made my own: Romaine Steak - extra charge Black beans  Avocado - extra Corn Carrot Tomato Aged cheddar - extra No dressing needed.  The salad had so little avocado that I actually asked them to check. They dug through it with gloves hands and showed me a chunk. The steak was a bit grey and not particularly flavorful.  Overall it was good, but not the great I remembered. Perhaps next time I need to go back to my spinach and goat cheese standby."}
{"text":"Parking: Free Parking in specific spots, while other spots will be 30 minutes maximum due to the overwhelming traffic that comes and goes in area. The parking lot is huge so you'll most likely find a spot.  Venue: Small - 6 tables off to the side accompanied by a wall couch, 2 by the entrance with chairs and 1 round table in the middle for hanging out or eating your burrito. It's your typical grab and go (or quick sit and eat) type of venue.  Washrooms: Small but clean.  Experience: Felt like I was at a fast food chain, similar to that of Subway/Thai Express, basically you order your food at the cashier and you pick it up when it's ready. They ask for your name giving it a touch of a \"Starbucks\" experience.   How's the food?  I've tried the Khao San and the Zen. Reasonably priced for the burrito's but I thought it was a bit heavily priced for the salad."}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews unless a place really left an impression on me. In this case it was a terrible impression and experience. If I can give 0 star I would. Got the pangoa bowl with chicken, which was extra btw. Came home and I was so excited to eat. Turns out the rice was super hard, it was balled up on multiple chunks, disgusting, and the most that pissed me off was that they forgot the chicken. Like are you serious? I ordered from the same girl and the same girl made my order. Like how the hell can you forget? The whole place didn't even have customers. Spare your money and time. DON'T COME HERE AT ALL."}
{"text":"Having played basketball in the area, I was really happy to see a Freshi opening up! Walking into the store, the decor felt warm and inviting. They have this amazing wooden table for communal dining, comfortable sofa seats or separate tables and chairs for less open seating. You'll always have a place to sit! I asked one of the staff for something with a sweet kick and he suggested the Pangea bowl. It was delicious!! It was exactly what I wanted and satisfied my craving! It had enough protein to veggie to carb ratio and I was full without feeling bloated. The banana nut crunch smoothie is also to die for! Craving it as I write this post! Perfect after a workout! Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I love eating salad. For years, I have been eating a salad for lunch every day. Unfortunately, work has been exceptionally busy for the last several months that I have had to resort to eating at my desk.   I decided to stop making salad for lunch and bring sandwiches instead. It felt strange.  I have been eating salad for dinner instead. I feel better. No withdrawal symptoms!  Today, I craved a salad for lunch. I haven't been to Freshii for years. It was time to revisit the place.   This one in Vaughan looks new. It's clean. Staff were friendly taking my order and handing me my salad.   I ordered the fiesta salad, which consists of corn, black beans, tomatoes, onions, cheese, mixed greens, all tossed in a cilantro lime dressing. I added tofu to make it meatless.   The salad was delicious! It was a decent size. I tend to not have that much dressing on it, though. Luckily, the excess was left at the bottom of the bowl.   I had wanted to try a smoothie, but I was informed that the smoothie machine was broken. Ugh!  I need to eat at Freshii more often. So good! I'm craving what I will order from the place the next time I'm there.   (136)"}
{"text":"I work out at LA Fitness across the street and was so excited that Freshii opened. After a gym session, I usually go for a healthy snack afterwards like a green smoothie or a bowl.  The food has always been yummy and staff was friendly.  I started the 5 day Slim Box yesterday and love it. It's 3 meals and 2 snacks for the day which helps me with my fitness nutritional goals. I struggle with eating healthy consistently so this really helps for me.  Also a note- I love the interior of this location, it feels like summer inside with the grass walls and wooden tables."}
{"text":"Freshii. Always great food whenever I order from this clean eats chain. They always own up to their name. This was my first time at this particular location as I was craving Freshii and I wasn't downtown. This is actually pretty big compared to the other Freshii locations I have visited. I thought that it was clean, and well kept. They have a cool 'Freshii wall' that goes with the clean eats theme too!  Food - amazing as usual. If you're looking for a good healthy meal (usually post-workout) and need something quick to grab, I recommend the Terriyaki bowl with added chicken protein. It was very satisfying and if you like hot, don't forget to take that sirahcha bottle that's provided there and squeeze it all over the bowl.   Service - I came here for take out because I wanted a quick bite. They were pretty quick with service. Even when I waited they had samples of strawberry banana juice to try (was tempted to buy that too).   Overall - would definitely come back. Fan of the food!"}
{"text":"Holly Energii Balls!   The restaurant is nice and looks clean, gives you that Modron fresh look, just exactly what they are aiming for  I found it though, the staff are all amateurs, and they do not seem to have much knowledge of the menu, the two staff members at the cash were constantly asking each other questions about the menu then when none of them know the answer, then they go to the back and ask at the kitchen This is on a Saturday brunch time, so expected to be busy therefore you should have your strongest stuff on board  now on to the food part, I ordered the eggs and cheese spinach mushroom egg buckets, they are good in size and they are very filling It has goat cheese, and it complements all the ingredients together nicely My only critique on this, as it should be all warmed up and melted all together, nice and crispy, which was not the case with my order   Speaking of these Energii balls, little things are so tasty and filling!! They are little peanut butter balls mixed with oats, honey, chocolate chip and some other stuff depends on which kind you pick, you could have coconuts and pumpkin seeds and all sorta fun stuff.  All in all, call place and I will be returning customer every now and then, I'm looking to see some better customer service in the future   Good job Freshii"}
{"text":"The food is OK. Just OK. The real problem I have is the value. They charge a ridiculous premium for something like beef but then seriously skimp on the portions! If I'm paying 13+ dollars for a burrito and you're individually plucking out pieces of meat because you may have put too much, there is something wrong. Put more meat in your bowls/wraps/burritos!  I was initially excited that this place had opened up close to home but in the 3 times I have been there, I have been seriously unimpressed.   I'll try again in 6 months when they hopefully have the kinks ironed out."}
