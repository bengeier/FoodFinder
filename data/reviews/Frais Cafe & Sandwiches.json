{"text":"When we arrived, only because the place slightly closer was trop occup√©, we were the only ones in here. What?!   This is an amazing, fresh, delicious place to eat! I had a salad and sandwich, the hubby had soup and sandwich. Both equally deeelish!   Great, clean, open atmosphere and happily got busier while we ate. :)"}
{"text":"You have to go there. The coffee is excellent, the banana et noix muffin, exquisite, and all the food is fresh and tasty. Owners are very nice and friendly!"}
{"text":"Nice place with a clean modern feel.  Frais Cafe & Sandwiches delivers exactly what the name promises, good sandwiches made fresh daily with a choice of soup or salad and a maybe a brownie for desert.  When you walk into Frais you might see what looks like a long line and you might want to turn around and grab a sandwich at the Tim Hortons on the corner. Don't the line isn't as long as you think, the system just makes it look that way. Take the length of the line and cut it in three one third of people are ordering one third are paying and one third are waiting to pickup their food. It sounds funny but it works better then you might think, give it a chance the turkey and smoked Gouda sandwich is worth it.  If you arrive at 12:00 you might find it hard to get a seat so I suggest that you get there either a little early like 11:50 or around 12:30 when the lunch crowd starts to thin.   The people who work here are great every time I've gone for lunch I'm always greeted with a smile and by the time I'm done eating the owner/manager has come by at least once to see how thing were and clear my plate himself. I find this to be a nice little touch specially in a little sandwich shop, I've been to 5 star restaurants which didn't make me feel this appreciated as a customer.  This is a nice little place for a quick bit a lunch time nothing complicated."}
