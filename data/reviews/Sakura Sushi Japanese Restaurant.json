{"text":"Sushi is good, but man, the service is completely absent! 45 min for tea? Seriously? After 4 requests? Almost 2 hrs for dinner??? The sushi is good, but I'd look elsewhere tbh."}
{"text":"Come here almost every week love it everything is very fresh. And staff are very friendly they make you feel at home. Favorite sushi spot in Toronto"}
{"text":"In one word.   Excellent.  The best sushi I have ever had.  Nice little place.   Great staff and the best food.  Can't ask for anything else.  This is the only place I am going to from now on."}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times.  Very friendly family that runs the restaurant.  My kids (boys 9, 11, 13) love going here and the quality of the food is excellent!  The hot entrees - tempura, gyoza, etc. come out hot and just cooked.  The sushi and sashimi are fresh and consistent quality.  We have tried different parts of the menu and all have been good. They also give good recommendations."}
{"text":"I go for sushi at least twice a week. Sakura is now my go to place. I used to go to Dragon Rolls but the service there has become unacceptable. Sakura has amazing service and the food is super fresh. The owner remembers us and makes sure we are always looked after. I had been to Dragon Rolls over 40 times and was always treated like a stranger and as if I was intruding on their time."}
{"text":"I knew there was a reason I got up this morning. 

Ok, I went here a few months ago, and it is definitely the first sushi place I have been to that I really didn't like. As we all know, there are at least 4 other sushi places in Pickering alone, but somehow this is the closest to my house. 

Maybe it was my fault for not ordering sushi, or maybe this place is just inadequate. When I walked in there was no one in there but the staff, that should have tipped me off, as it was approaching dinner time. I ordered something to the extent of teriyaki beef, to go, and waited about ten minutes for it. 

When I got home, I was not impressed. I didn't know if the beef was starting to turn, or this is how they cook, but it was a grainy-chewy-partly mushy kind of texture that I knew was not right. The soup and salad and other sides that came with the dish were standard, but I just could not get over this mystery beef. 

Maybe next time I should order the sushi, or walk the 20 minutes to Makimono."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp. The food was great, service was good, place is very clean. Very satisfied."}
{"text":"Sushi is great but I've noticed the service over the years has deteriorated. They're not friendly when you genuinely ask a question. Many times I've jut wanted to walk away and not order because of how they've spoken to me."}
{"text":"Sakura is the best sushi restaurant that my husband and I have ever been to.  While we lived in Pickering, we were regular customers of this restaurant and never had a bad experience.  The food and the owner are amazing.  Since moving, we deeply miss our weekly Sakura fix.  I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone!"}
{"text":"What an unexpected surprise.

I was craving some Japanese food and I didn't want to travel far. Lately the sushi scene in ajax/Pickering has been going downhill and I didn't feel like spending any more money on low quality food and service. And behold! Sakura!

First off, the setting is quite nice. My mother and I went pretty late for dinner on Sunday and the place was pretty empty. However, the server was quite attentive and the food was great. 

I ordered the sashimi donburi ($14) and my mom ordered the sakura bento ($25). The sashimi donburi was more of a Korean dish and it was soooo yummy. 

My mother's order, however, was not as satisfying. The tempura was a little on the salty side and the batter wasn't that crispy fluffy type we are used to, rather more like a fish and chips type batter. And the beef teriyaki was really hard. 

All in all, the setting, service, sushi and sashimi dishes were excellent, maybe the best in ajax/pickering area but the hot dishes fell flat. I would definitely come back the sashimi donburi and sushi."}
{"text":"Honestly I love this place. The food is just fantastic and the service is great. You always get more than would you've ordered and everything tastes delicious. If you want great Japanese food this is the place. The chicken teriyaki with sweet potato noodles will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Durham Region! The food is great, the sushi tastes fresh and well made. The owners are very nice! I ordered the love boat which I recommend for 2-3 people!!"}
{"text":"Was ok. Not good, not bad... ok.  Went for late lunch and was told I could only come in if I could finish by a certain time... odd but ok.  Had a lunch special, wanted a cheaper Maki than what was on the special had to pay extra...off but ok.  Soup and salad came, no chopsticks, no spoon.  Bento box came quick.  Wasn't terrible but it wasn't good enough to warrant the current star rating they have.

Value: low
Quality: medium high
Service: medium poor"}
{"text":"Definitely not as rated. I was looking forward to a great sushi meal. I was not happy. The server was overworked as he seemed to be the one who served customers and answered calls for takeout. 

Miso soup was watered down. Salad was not Asian as it had some kind of fruity dressing. The sushi was ok. It had a lot more rice than actual fish. Disappointed that they used simulated crab meat on sushi. 

We saw several people come in for takeout so I'm sure that other dishes might be good.   Just not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"Sakura is a small but busy sushi bar, a nice change from the trend of All You Can Eat sushi. I've never had dinner there but their lunch combos are good value with excellent variety. The friendly staff will often offer you samples of their Korean fare to try including excellent and fiery kimchee."}
{"text":"I've lived in Pickering 2 years not and I JUST discovered this place. I spent so long complaining that there were no good sushi places in Pickering. I should have come here sooner. I enjoyed every bite, the spicy tuna roll is a MUST try. They are generous with the amount of tuna they use and the spice is just right. When you dine in they give you little side dishes that are great."}
{"text":"The food was excellent.  Fresh & well prepared.  The staff are friendly.  The atmosphere was comfortable.  The restaurant is quite small but, even though it was filled to capacity, it was easy to have a conversation with others at your table (we sat in a booth).
They do lose points for having poor service.  We waited close to 10 minutes before anyone approached the table to ask if we'd like anything to drink.  Once we ordered, the food & green tea refills were delivered in a timely manner.  My friend enjoyed a beer with her meal but was never asked if she'd like another one.  We were not offered tea, coffee or desert.  In fact, we were left for about another 10 minutes until finally going to the counter to get the bill.  We weren't given the bill by our server, nor were we told that we had to pay at the counter.  And....their debit/credit machine was filthy!
Bottom line:  The food is the best Japanese food I think I've ever had so I'll definitely go back & would highly recommend it.  Just be prepared for slow service & a yukky debit/credit machine!"}
{"text":"Found this place right here on Yelp and decided to see for ourselves if the good reviews here were justified. The time was 4 PM so we were the only guests there. By the time we were finishing our meal, there was another group of 4 people that walked in. 

Overall, a positive experience. The food came out fast, was fresh and tasted good. Their miso is rather think (no just broth that most other places serve). Salad dressing has red-ish colour (usually it's yellow / orangey). 

The place is very small and you probably won't notice it unless you already know it's there. Prices are moderate. Have I eaten better sushi than here? Yes, I have. But this was very good too and is excellent value."}
{"text":"I'm surprised how high the ratings are. It was good but not super amazing. The prices were a bit on the high side. We were in the area and decided to stop by here. 

I had the chicken teriyaki bento box. The chicken was a bit dry and could be tastier. The rolls were fine and it also came with some shrimp/veggie tempera. I was quite stuffed and had to pack some home. 

Staff was nice and we got some comp dishes. My fav was the rice balls."}
{"text":"HIDDEN GEM IN PICKERING. Pickering is known for its copycat chain restaurants, and most of the japanese restaurants you find are low quality all-you-can-eat places, but that is not the case for Sakura Sushi. 

This is an authentic japanese family-owned restaurant, and the quality is top-notched, especially for their prices. You can choose where to sit, so we sat in a cute closed booth. After ordering, we were immediately brought miso soup and green salad, and I never knew there could be such a difference in quality. The miso soup had large, fresh chunks of tofu and plenty of seaweed, and the salad had what seemed like a homemade dressing. 

FOOD: I ordered the chirashi ($20) and it came with 18 pieces of sashimi on a bed of SUSHI rice (not just plain white rice). The fish was high quality and the sushi rice (you can tell because it's slightly sweeter and has a hint of vinegar) complimented it nicely. I also had the chance to try the teriyaki salmon in the lunch bento box and it was so light and flaky!

Overall, I definitely recommend this place. The food is amazing and the service was great too. Though part of me wants to keep this hidden gem hidden all to myself..."}
{"text":"They make it just how you want it.

I'm not a fan of sushi, but this place is so good that I made an exception for it . They make the sushi just the way you would like it. They remove any ingredients that you dislike and they will give you extra of some ingredients if that's your preference, like extra mayo or extra tempura or extra sesame seeds. No additional charge. They know how to take care of their customers and that's why I keep coming back. 

My favorite is this Spicy Philadelphia roll.  They shake toasted sesame seeds on the outside of their rolls and that's what makes their sushi extra tasty. The sushi pieces are huge too and they are tightly wrapped so they don't fall apart when you're eating it, like other places. These people know what they're doing!

The people here are really friendly and the service is great. I usually call and order ahead of time so that its ready for my pickup.

There are sushi places all over town but this is the best I've had. I recommend this place."}
{"text":"We wanted to try sushi in Canada because we've never had that experience before. We decided to come here after reading the reviews and were very happy that we did. The place looked very cute and was small and homey. I ordered the Donburi with unagi BBQ eel and liked it a lot. The eel was sweet and delicious. We also shared a sushi and sashimi boat with spicy golden dragon roll. Presentation was beautiful and we loved the dragon well as well. Sushi and sashimi were fresh and tasted great. Service was friendly and quick. I'm glad we got to have a great sushi experience in Canada. Will definitely return here when in the area!"}
{"text":"Most amazing vegetarian sushi and the atmosphere is out of this world. Friendly staff and the green tea is so earthy, it's like warm hug on a cold day."}
{"text":"Food was amazing! Service was great! Everything we ordered was fresh and came super quick. I loved my spicy seafood udon it was delicious! My company also enjoyed their meals."}
{"text":"This is a great option for sushi in west Durham.  I like the booths and the Japanese decor.  I am also very happy there is a good option out our way that isn't AYCE.  The quality here is higher than that and the service is quite good.  I've been here many times and not been disappointed.  Note, if you order the seaweed salad it is massive.  About 3x more than I am accustomed to getting.  Not that I am complaining."}
{"text":"Sakura,

the little guy thats packing a huge punch among his franchise competators who's philosophy is quantity over quality.

You do not want to go to Sakura if you hate excellent service, fresh meats and vegetables, a variety of Soju/Sake and beers and a calm relaxed environment. Instead you should go to a low quality  rushed restaraunt thats main focus is to stuff your gullet as quickly as possible and rotate you out with the next line up of mindless Japanese cuisine \"fans\" with no idea of what real food should taste like.

Sakura is up there with some of the best japanese/Korean dishes i have ever had and i would choose them any day over the large franchise buffet style spots.


sure you are paying a little more but why is that even an issue when the service and food is second to none.


enjoy."}
