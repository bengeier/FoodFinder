{"text":"Great food great service. Although the location is a bit hard to find, the food and service are amazing! Great taste, great presentation, clean environment, has a patio, polite servers

I came mainly to try the El Huevo Malo. It was delicious and has many different flavours. In the core is sweet coffee ice cream + a little sour raspberry (?) cake + salty crunchy nuts. 

The chocolate shell is sweet and covered in a little bit sour cream + sweet honeycomb + flowers + sweet drizzle. 
It's an explosion of flavour 

The Cerdo crispy pork's taste reminds me of Chinese food flavours

The beef heart was also just the right amount of chewy and spicy. 

Overall, amazing restaurant!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem. The environment is super cool and different and the food and service is amazing. Some of the food we ordered did take a while but they tried their best to accommodate and apologized (I don't think this usually happens). I loved the suckling pig, concha, and baby beet salad. The food is very unique, it is quite pricey but it would be a great place to meet up for drinks or a date night out. I would love to come back for a special occasion."}
{"text":"First off, the entire vibe was amazing, from the atmosphere to the greeting, warm smiles of your staff. 

The hostess, Alexa, was outstandingly accommodating to us. We had no reservations and she told us we could stand at the bar and grab drinks and jump onto the next seats that would become available. However, without hesitation or without us even asking, she carried over two barstool seats for us! Talk about above and beyond!

Then, your newest bartender, Eric! Amazing. He was fast, attentive and very kind. His drinks were delicious and he was very friendly. 

The food was great as well; we enjoyed the salmon and tuna. Highly recommend this place to everyone. However, please praise your staff, especially Eric and Alexa, as they were fantastic.

Thank you for the great experience as it was our first visit to Toronto!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing and I got lots of advices from the bar tender (one of the perks from sitting at the bar) 
If you want a table, make a reservation in advance."}
{"text":"The entrance to Mira is hidden took us awhile to find it; but it's definitely a hidden gem!! Love the vibe of the restaurant, very friendly staff and knowledgeable server. She suggested some real good appetizers and main courses for us to all share. Portions are great, just right amount and taste super scrumptious. Our server let us know how to savour each of our dishes and all of them do not disappoint. The dessert is to die for and definitely IG worthy! Will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Hadn't heard too much about Mira but it came up in a Yelp search and we enjoyed the meal, experience and night tremendously. 
The yucca fries are served with two sauces and both pair very well with the dish.  We had the Mira ceviche and while the tastes were on point, the fish itself was a tad chewy for my liking. Perhaps that particular one had more sinew than normal. 

We had the squid/squid ink with scallop dish and was impressed. The textures and flavours were delicious and the dish was quite unique. The suckiling pork dish was served with something jam over quinoa and again a great dish! The pork was tender and soft. The jam was super tasty and made this dish!
The ambience is cozy, trendy and cool all at the same time! No our servers friendly and helpful. 

Overall, I'd definitely recommend Mira and look to return again soon!"}
{"text":"I've heard so much about this place from friends... but they must have had a different hostess... The hostess last night was so, so rude and didn't know how to do her job. What a crappy start to a night we were really looking forward to!"}
{"text":"Mira takes dining to a whole new level. To start off with, it's a hidden away place but still in the heart of the city. As you walk through the little side alleyway, you are hit by this vibrant buzz once you enter the restaurant. The cocktails are fabulous with a Peruvian twist to it, specially the Pisco Sours and Garden Cocktail. We tried a number of dishes on the table, which were mostly shareable plates, but the best was for the end - El Huevo Malo, in hindsight I would have started my meal with that. All in all it's a great place and reflects the vibe of Miraflores neighbourhood of Peru, but in Toronto!"}
{"text":"I came to Mira as a vegetarian, with the expectation that I'd make a few exceptions. As a veg, one need not starve here, but if you're willing to at least go pescatarian you're in for a treat. In the end, we mostly vegetarian but added Mira's signature ceviche.
Admittedly not everything was out of this world. But the ceviche menu alone deserves all of the stars. The fluke in the namesake ceviche is incredibly light, the citrus is explosive and addictive, while the puffed corn adds a welcome balanced crunch to mix it up. The mango ceviche is full of layers of tang and complex flavours that I can scarcely describe but are a must to not ignore. We ignored the other two ceviche options and this I regret.
We also opted for the truffle risotto and the yucca fries. The risotto had a rich and earthy flavour and was cooked perfectly while the fried truffles added a well balanced crunch while also melting in the mouth. It's not a perfect dish; artichoke feels superfluous here incorporating a chewy addition that seems altogether unnecessary. But otherwise damn fine. Earlier reviews by others on the yucca fries seem mixed. Some love them, some not remotely. Count me in the love them camp: the naysayers are wrong.
Because we are greedy and stupid we also opted for two desserts: the chocolate egg and something else which only rarely pops up as a limited edition item (our waiter tells me it's a backup for when he's out of another dessert item). The latter was some sort of yogurt dish with a Peruvian fruit ice cream and fresh pistachios. I've forgotten it's name but it was fresh and unique. I c any day as I'd had anything quite like it. The chocolate egg is an experience to watch it cracked and opened in front of you. Ultimately it's pretty underwhelming to eat though. The chocolate is dry, the mousse inside lacks flavour, however the espresso ice cream and brownie in the centre make up for those shortcomings: they are not to be ignored. Nevertheless it was more than we could bear and we couldn't finish.
Mira isn't cheap. It's definitely something to treat yourself and your date to. But it's also part of Toronto's vibrant and eclectic food scene. It's a bit of a hidden gem, not everything is exceptional but it's still a great spot to visit and keeps some creative items on hand. Highly recommended but also don't let the size of the dishes fool you. You'll leave full."}
{"text":"Tucked away in a back alley off of Wellington, the entrance is lit with candlelit lanterns that sets the mood of the interior. The cocktails are superb, featuring a special Peruvian liquor, pisco, derived from grapes. Victoria and Mira Mira are recommended. As for wine we got the Chilean sauvignon blanc that was similar to a NZ. Everything we got on the menu was amazingly delicious. From octopus, to ceviche to quinoa salad to suckling pig and the freshest take on funnel cake dessert, all phenomenal. Highly rated, and suggested for a casual yet classy night of delicious food at a reasonable price point."}
{"text":"A bit of a hidden gem recommended by a colleague of mine. We came here for my beautiful moms birthday. Honestly I couldnt figure out the entry way but when I did it was a nice candle lit walk up into the place.

On our Lyft ride there our driver was from Peru and had nothing but good things to say about the food and recommended a few items for us. The main course was AMAZING. I got the chicken and my mom got the grouper and we murdered it in seconds. WOW. It was on the smaller side but I was already pretty full from the free \"peruvian\" popcorn they serve. Picture attached. 

The only thing I didn't like was the ceviche. I was not expecting how tart/ sour it would be and honestly felt my tastebuds were getting dissolved. Not my cup of tea.

Speaking of tea and beverages, they had hot water! If you read my last review of Momofuku you know how important hot water is for an asian mom. They went out of their way and got us a tea pot full of it.

It was beautiful inside, had a very upscale but not super posh vibe to it. At the end we spent about 80 bucks all in and I was hoping they would toss the dessert in for free, but no.

FYI the chairs have really good lumbar support."}
{"text":"Mira, te amo! 

Stopped in for Thursday night dinner and my experience from the moment I entered the restaurant to the moment I left was superb. 

Mira is located just off Wellington, behind Shopify and across from Spin. You basically walk down a short alley decorated with large lanterns and walk right into the restaurant. 

As I walked in I was immediately greeted by two friendly hosts who offered to take my coat. The complimentary coat check is a really nice touch. One of the hosts walked me over to our table which was located in corner by the bar. This spot actually gave us a really good vantage point of the entire restaurant. Great for looking at the gorgeous design on the space, which was a lot more spacious than I initially expected it to be.  The ambiance is lively,  and it was nice to see a mix of folks there. Basically, this place is great for the after work crowd, romantic dates, or casual group hangouts. 

Mira offers about a dozen or so cocktails all at $15.  Half the list are piscos and the other half are classic cocktails with a Mira spin on them. I opted for the Victoria, which I was told was a very popular choice (see pictures).  This is one spicy tropical drink!  The peppercorn on top adds a nice little kick. Absolutely recommend this drink. 
  
The meal was just divine. We opted for two small plates, two entrees and a dessert to share:

Conchas - we ordered this based on the Yelp reviews and they are every bit a delicious as people say.  Scallops on the half shell, served with atomic butter taste like decadence - honestly I would be happy eating this for the rest of my life. 

Ceviche Trio -  Grouper, Fluke and Tuna - all of them light, refreshing and unique in their on way.  The Nikkei Atun (tuna) had a nice spicy flavour so it ended up being our favourite. 

Sudado de Pescado - this was a lovely grouper dish served with a crispy potato and a plantain chip.  The accompanying sauce was so incredibly flavourful.

Salmón Teriyaki Anticuchos - basically salmon teriyaki. Really great presentation with the skewers. The fish was well cooked and the yuzu kosho added a really nice kick on flavour to the entire dish. 

Picarones (for dessert) - donut made with sweet potato and squash, topped with lucuma ice cream, fresh pineapple and crisps.  Really great for sharing between 3 - 4 (or 2) people and lightness of the dessert ends the meal really nicely. 

The cherry on top was really our server Luis. Super engaging, insightful, and attentive throughout our meal. He even offered us some of his own experiences in Peru and discussed some of the ingredients used in the dishes. I learned a lot about the food we ate and history behind Peruvian cuisine.  I will say that the dishes here are a little on the pricier side considering the quantity, but I found the quality of the meal, along with the impeccable customer service made it all worthwhile.

Definitely look forward to returning!"}
{"text":"I have been to Mira twice in 1 week. The food the second time was a bit better than the first. The service is great. The servers are very friendly, knowledgeable and explain the menu to you which is useful because the food is unique. The manager also comes around to check on the guests.

The place is harder to find if you are not familiar with the area. It's located in an alleyway across from Spin.

Here is what we had on my most recent visit:

Appetizers: 1.) Concha. Scallops on the half-shell bathed in atomic butter. Excellent. Probably my favourite dish. 2) Jalea Mixto. Lightly battered assorted deep fried seafood that comes with a vinegary sauce (sauce is similar to the red vinegar used with Chinese dumplings). Big portion and tastes great. 3) Pulpo. 6 to 8 small pieces of grilled octopus. Also great. 4)Nikkei Atun Ceriche. The sauce was unique and tasted great.

Main course: 1) Chuleton. Very tender and perfectly grilled ribeye (much better than the short rib which comes out well done and continues to cook on the hotplate. Had this on my first visit - I just did not like the short rib. 2) Cerdo. Suckling pig. Again very good. 3) Sudado do Pescado. Battered grouper. Not much taste. Not my favourite. 4) Arroz con Mariscos. Squid ink rice with scallops. So good and much better than the Arroz con setas which I found bland and kind of dry.

Dessert:  Chocolate ball. It's fun to see the ball being broken into parts. Fees 4 to 5 people. This is good, but I am generally not a dessert fan."}
{"text":"ICONINK and Chef Stuart Cameron do it again by creating a menu that is delicious, creative, and inspiring! I had the pleasure of dining at Mira last night, and what a delight it was!  

We had a bit of hard time finding it. It's nestled in between two buildings down a long alley filled with lanterns and string lights.  It reminded me of an unexpected event I crashed in the Miraflores district in Lima at La Rosa Nautica; walking up the very long dock in the dark with lanterns flickering in the wind. It feels like a secret which adds to the anticipation - what awaits me at the end of this long stroll? Once inside the design of the restaurant itself is a mix of fun and lively patterns and tiles, brick walls, wood and metal tables adding an industrial feel, and dim lights creating a sultry mood. The music was fun and I certainly sang along to most of the songs. Overall it felt like a magical casserole of the unexpected. The perfect blend of ingredients!

Like the design, the food was also the perfect blend of ingredients.  With Byblos being in my top 3 restaurants in the world I have been to, I was eager to try some new dishes by Chef Stuart Cameron! We ordered 12 dishes off the menu. Here are my top favourites:

Tartar de Carne (Steak tartar)- This is hands down the best tartar I have ever had. Period.  The elderberries popping in my mouth was unexpected. The flavour of the creme and the crunch of the potato topping the fresh meat was delicious. This dish was balanced and amusing. 

Mira Ceviche - I wanted to drink a tall glass of the Leche de Tigre! It had just a hint of spice and the citrus was strong but not overpowering. The fluke was so fresh it melted in my mouth. 

Altamar Ceviche - What?!?!?  I have no words for this dish.  The strong taste of passionfruit mixed with the spicy chiles topped with the crispy thin sweet potato was perfection.  The grouper was super fresh.

Chuleton (Rib Eye Steak) - The meat was cooked so perfectly and the taste was simple yet flavourful. The cassava added a nice firm texture to pair with the tender meat. 

Esparragos (Asparagus) - Just get this.  Don't question me. 

Mousse de Lucuma - It's an explosion of flavours and textures! The lucuma was subtle and sweet with a creamy texture, the passionfuit ice cream was tangy and tart, and the little bits of cocoa nibs added this surprising crunch. The bowl tied it all together and satisfied that hankering for something chocolate. 

The server was attentive and we had several team members visiting our table to drop off food and explain what each dish was. 

This was truly an exceptional and unforgettable meal! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It was a great experience. Great food, service and ambience. From beginning to end, it was terrific!! 
I'd come back again!!
I took all of Alex' (the bartender) recommendations and he was bang on,  I wasn't disappointed at all!!
It was a wonderful evening!!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem would be the best way to describe this new hot spot on King West. The entrance is a bit hidden unless you are familiar with the former club F-stop. You might not be familiar with Peruvian food but the chef behind the food here is definitely not a stranger to you as a real foodie - he once was the chef at Patria and Byblos. 

We came here for my friends birthday party. I brought a cake for which not surprisingly they wanted to charge $5 cutting fee per person. Most of restaurants do these days. But at the end, we said we would order two more desserts and they waived the cutting fees and the desserts turn out to be fantastic. So we are happy with the result. 

We ordered beet salad, bay scallop, ceviche trio, duck breast, beef heart, yuca fries and a mushroom side dish. The waiter suggested 4 apps and 4 mains since there were 4 of us and the portion tends to be small, but knowing our limits we went for 3 and 3 which we were glad we did. We were pretty full at the end! 

Everything came to our table was absolutely delicious, especially the beet salad, yuca fries and the beef heart. What's even better was the two desserts our waiter recommended. The first we had is called cachangas, really good. The second dessert was Lucuma mousse which was sooo nice. I asked what Lucuma was and it turned out to be a tropical fruit that is not available here in Toronto! So delicious. 

I had a glass of 5 oz Malbec and my friends ordered a few cocktails. They were all nicely done. 

All in all, we are very happy with the food and the service over all. And the price level is also pretty on point."}
{"text":"A spontaneous decision to come here for dinner with a group of friends in an attempt to try something new. Well... INSTANT FAVOURITE! The service, the atmosphere and the FOOD!! There were five of us, we ordered five mains, 3 apps, and a couple of sides.  Every single item was amazing, with the Cerdo and the Sudado Pescado stealing the show. The pace of service was perfect. The drinks, the wine, the spacing of food was exactly how it needed to be so we could enjoy every item that we ordered. We were fortunate to get in without a reservation, but this was a night that we all appreciated. 5 stars and thank you to Andres for your knowledge, the fantastic service and attention to detail."}
{"text":"Make reservations. If you are into this style of cuisine, Go there. You will not be disappointed. Food and Service were outstanding."}
{"text":"My friend and I visited Mira to try the El Huevo Malo after a lovely afternoon at Allan Gardens and it was the perfect treat! The restaurant has a classy yet relaxed ambience about it. The service was friendly and pleasant all around; the hostess made my friend and I feel especially welcomed!

The El Huevo Malo itself was everything I wanted it to be. There is an amazing combination of flavours, textures, and colours so it is as much an aesthetic delight as it is one for your tastebuds. My friend and I loved how the exterior shell was made of dark chocolate and found that it complemented the elements of fruit and sweet cream inside very well. For the price you pay ($14), I definitely found it to be worth it, as it is a sizeable amount (we needed to walk it off before we grabbed dinner!) and is such a unique experience. I also liked how we didn't feel too judged for only coming here for the dessert  I still dream about the El Huevo Malo sometimes and this is definitely not the last time I will gush about it!!"}
{"text":"Beautiful decoration and vibe. Don't know about the food. Came in at 10 PM on a night when the restaurant is open until 1 AM. Apparently the kitchen was closed, and it closes at a different time every night (?) would've loved to try it, but it seems like they prefer to close the kitchen early rather than keeping their service consistent."}
{"text":"We went here for our anniversary after hearing good things about the place online. Well, I now have a new favorite restaurant in the city.  

Everything we ate here was seriously amazing. The presentation is just great and everything that reached our table was beautiful to look at and tasty.  the service is very knowledgeable about the food and very friendly. 

We placed our order the waiter brought out some spiced baked corn. It was delicious. A great way to wait for the rest of the food. 

Next up, Yucca Fries. Wow. I've never had yucca before but I'm a fan now. Lightly sprinkled with Pamersan cheese they come with two different dips, Peruvian Black Mint (the green one) and an other yellow dip which I believe was some kind of pepper. Both were delicious and flavorful. Highly recommend. I would come back just for these fries.

For the mains, we got the Chuletón and the Tacu Tacu Pato (duck). Both were cooked to perfection. 

For the dessert we ordered the infamous \"El Huevo Malo\", which is basically a giant Kinder Surprise egg cracked open at the table and filled with delicious goodness like coffee ice cream, brownie and raspberry chunks. It was a lot so we took the leftover home. 

The only critique I have is that when we ordered the beer (which does not appear on the menu) I assumed that the price would be comparable to other restaurants in the city ($7-8 per beer). However upon receiving the bill each beer turned out to be $12, which is quite overpriced in my opinion. Regardless, this place is a must go, we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Loved this new restaurant! A bit hard to find since it's in a dark alley but what a treasure once you do. It's food and service were 5 stars. Must try's:

- Concha: bay scallops with this over the top butter sauce that made me have a foodgasm
-mira ceviche: great fresh white fish, sweet potatoes and corn which was fresh and zesty
- Corazón Anticucho: beef heart which you would never normally order but it was so delicious. A bit spicy and something that will put this restaurant on the map
- Arroz con Setas: rice with mushrooms and truffle sauce which is something I can't describe properly but am dreaming about.

I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"I went here on a weekend before 6pm. Pretty packed and full, decided to sit at the bar. The service was AMAZING!!!!! Our bartender was so passionate and gave us a lovely experience. The ceviche are must to order!! For starters, best to try the trio first. It was fresh and sweet! Great ambience. Highly recommended for dates and intimate nights. My first time experiencing Peruvian food. They have a fusion Japanese chef which you can taste his inspiration through his dishes. The only thing that we had trouble finding was the actual restaurant itself. However it was a fun mystery!!"}
{"text":"I've been to a couple of Pervian restaurants because my boyfriend is Pervian but also because I love the food. C'mon, chevice  Out of all the ones I've tried this has to be the best one! The food, service and ambiance is amazing. Only downfall for me was portions sizes were a bit small, good for tasting alot of different things. Our server Luis was top-notch he recommend many different dishes and cocktails and we enjoyed it all. It was our one year anniversary and we were also accompanied by my boyfriend parents, Andrés (possibly the owner) was kind enough to give us Pisco to celebrate our special day. We don't get great service like this anywhere! Will be back for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"They do it their own way- whether ceviche, beef tartare, sashimi, conch or short ribs. Everything we tried was completely unique in that it was their own take on the original...and it was fabulous. packed full of flavour while also having all the subtle notes of the finest meals I've ever had. Mira has turned out to be absolute gem....and if you're there try the Victoria with your ceviche...they compliment very well"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and I'll go twice more!  This is definitely a hidden gem that does Peruvian food justice!  Located off of Wellington - down one alley, turn left, go down the alley with the lanterns, this place will not disappoint.

From the moment you enter there is someone at the door to greet you, take your coat and lead you to your table.  All with a friendly smile.  all the servers are lovely - they check up on you, explain the menu to you, refill you water without having to ask.  Honestly, they have upped the customer service game here - they do it well and they do it genuinely!

I can't wait to come back when they open the back patio!  

They have a great drinks menu - most drinks are $15, but they are pretty interesting.  I have had the Victoria (has a spicy kick, it's one of their more popular drinks) and one of the Rum drinks (the name escapes me at the moment - I'll update the review when i remember).  I preferred the Victoria.  

Food wise, oh my what haven't i had!  I've tried the Conchas - scallops (definitely a must).  You get 4 pieces, on the half shell, lots of butter...a whole lot of deliciousness.  I've had this twice and will continue to order this.

I've had the grouper ceviche and the ceviche trio (grouper, spicy tune and fluke).  All the ceviche was fresh and light, with lots of flavours, from spicy to a sweet mily taste.  (on my previous visit the server told me they get all their fish fresh, daily). 

The half cornish game hen I had before was juicy and perfectly cooked.  I could have eaten that all day long.  

The salmon teriyaki anticuchos - it was presented on skewers (I believe it was 4-5 skewers) and cooked perfectly.  

The Sudado de Pescado which I've had twice as well, was lovely.  Perfectly crisp skin, light and flaky fish, the sauce, the plaintain chips, it just all works so well.

The 2 desserts i've tried here are the famous chocolate bomb - it looks like a LARGE cadbury egg that they crack open at your table (it could seriously feed 4 people).  Inside there is raspberries, honeycomb, yuzu sauce....it all works so well. It comes with a scoop of ice cream - I believe it's a coffe flavoured one - whatever it is, it's delicious.  The flavours go together - sweet, tart, crunchy..  It's a party in your mouth!  

I've also had the Picarones - you get 2 \"donuts\".  Made from sweet potato and squash (yes you read that right, and no you can't tell that's what it is made of if you didn't read the menu).  Topped off with pineapple pieces and lucuma ice cream (google lucuma - it kinda looks like a tropical avocado).  It's a great dessert b/c it is not overly sweet.

The ambiance, the decor, the service (Luis was EXCELLENT - very informative, friendly, offering suggestions) and the food is great.  

Definitely coming back!  Now, I'm going to end this review by saying -  it's not cheap considering the portion size - so either expect to spend some $$ to order quite a few things, or be prepared to just get a few items here and you'll probably need to get a bite later on.  The portions are definitely on the smaller side, but the quality is phenomenal.  

Before you leave, make sure you take a picture of the llama!!"}
{"text":"Mira is definitely one of my new favourite restaurants in the city.

I came here on a weeknight with a friend and everything was great. Loved the vibe, decor, service, and food. It was a bit tricky to find, as it's located in an alleyway, and the entrance is a solid black metal door, with another solid black metal door adjacent to it. I wasn't sure which door to open! However, when I peeked inside, I was at the right place.

Most restaurants I've been to have a few standout dishes, as well as some so-so dishes that I wouldn't care to re-order. At Mira, everything was a standout dish. We started out with the ceviche trio ($25), which came with fluke, grouper, and tuna ceviches. Each had a unique flavour but were soft and fresh. Our server, Annie, recommended that we start from mildest fish (grouper) and end with the strongest fish (tuna). My favourite was the tuna, as it was a bit spicy. 

For mains, we ordered the suckling pig ($24) and the duck breast ($36). We expected these to be small, tapas-sized dishes, but they were actually quite a bit larger. What I appreciated was that each dish came with a \"side\" of its own. The suckling pig was served with quinoa fried rice, and the duck was served with a duck confit rice. Both dishes were delicious. I especially loved the crispiness of the fried quinoa, and the sweetness and tenderness of the suckling pig (it fell apart when I cut it in half). The duck breast was cooked perfectly, pink in the centre, and the duck confit gave texture and flavour to the rice, which was baked (?) into a brick shape. 

We also ordered the squid ink rice ($28), which was topped with plump scallops (not overcooked - very important!), crispy snap peas, and little dollops of (what I think was) a thick garlic saue. The squid pieces were embedded into the rice, and were not overly chewy. In retrospect, since the suckling pig and duck already came with a grain side, it wasn't necessary to order a separate rice dish, but it's okay because it was excellent. 

As a side dish, we ordered the Yucca fries - these were amazing. As a French-fry enthusiast, I was impressed with these. Thick-cut, crispy on the outside, and so mealy and soft on the inside. They came with two dipping sauces, a cheesy dip  as well as a more acidic lime/japeleno dip.

For dessert, we of course ordered the chocolate egg, which was filled with honey comb, raspberry pieces, yuzu, coffee ice cream, and some chocolate cake. Our server brought it to our table whole - it's the size of a small bowling ball - and cracked it in front of us. It was great, but it's definitely meant for 3-4 people. My friend and I ate the entire thing, but my teeth definitely hurt afterward! The ice cream scoop could definitely have been bigger, but I was so stuffed I didn't care. 

Service was great. Our server, Annie, checked in on us frequently and was very helpful with the menu. The pacing of the food was good, too. At no point did we feel we were being rushed or that we were waiting too long for our food. We had such a great time, we actually spent 3.5 hours there and it passed by so quickly!

100% would return for more. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Went out on a Monday evening and were initially sat at the bar but eventually moved to a table after asking several times. Hostess claimed that \"there was no space\" but moved us to their communal table which was remained empty the whole time- as well as some other tables nearby ! (Not sure what happened there). Nonetheless the service was good, the food runner and server explained each dish as it came. However could tell that it was a fairly new establishment as server's recommendations were along the lines of \"its good, you should get it\" and wasn't all that informed of the dish's makeup. 

To start we got the ceviche trio . Best one was Nikkei and Mira . Portion was larger than we expected so thumbs up . 

Next I got the squid ink risotto \"Arroz con Mariscos\". Was very flavourful, however the scallops were nothing special- definitely NOT mouth watering as expected.  My boyfriend got the short rib \"costillas anticucho\" and was very impressed. Presentation was definitely a bonus for both dishes. 

We ended with the Peruvian chocolate three ways \"Amor Con coco\". Was veryyyy chocolatt (duh) but very unique . I'm not a huge chocolate lover but my boyfriend really enjoyed it and I'll give it props for creativity.  Servers were kind enough to let us enjoy dessert on the patio as the place was slowing down. 

Although it was not a \"wow\" experience I think the place gained a lot of points because of its ambition experience and creativity. I feel like they just need to become a bit more established though to become extraordinaire. 

In end, would come back but not in a hurry."}
{"text":"This hidden gem is AMAZING! 

Everything from the decor to food was great. Though service can be improved.

I absolutely love the creativity put into each and every dish. Some are a hit/miss but I appreciate them trying new flavours. 

It's a tapa style so if you love sharing & trying diff types of food then this is the place for you! 

Highly recommend the squid ink risotto, it's my favourite dish of the night! Also, the ceviche was super fresh! No fishy taste. 

I'll def be back to try more of their menu. Next time I want to order the short rib! Smelled sooo good."}
{"text":"Best meal I've had in a while in Toronto! Mira is hidden across SPIN with a low key old plate as the sign for the restaurant. 
I definitely loved the seafood here. 
Concha is delicious bay scallops with rich butter. 
Ceviche trio are quite different but all amazing. I really enjoyed the spicy ceviche.  
Their yucca fries is not dry at all, unlike some of the other places. It's tender on the inside with a texture similar to potato fries, and the cheesy shavings made it so much better. 
And their dessert is the best part! Promise me to leave enough appetite to try out their desserts! 
Amor con Coco has different types of chocolate, either as a mousse, or crackers! I really liked the crispy chocolate knot on top of the plate. And each bite of the mousse is just so rich and delicious."}
{"text":"first and enjoyable dining experience for Peruvian food. Food tastes good and service is warm welcoming. It is a nice place for couples and friends. Definitely will come again."}
{"text":"I have a couple of friends from Peru and I've had some really good tasting Peruvian food so I was looking forward to checking out Mira, even though this visit was mainly for apps, drinks, and dessert.

It's not the easiest place to find, unless you know exactly what you're looking for. The narrow entrance is tucked away in an alley and the only sign (that I saw) was a small one tucked in a few steps from the main walkway. The walk to the door is lined with candles in huge lanterns and a few pendant lights. Very nice. Inside is intimately dark so let your eyes adjust before going too far. It's a nice place.

We ordered the Corazón Anticucho (beef heart), Yucca Fries, and then El Huevo Malo (chocolate bomb) for dessert. My companions had cocktails and I had a beer.

The beef heart is not my thing but my companions seemed to enjoy it. The yucca fries were okay but I prefer a more rustic version, just sliced and fried. These were more processed into perfectly shaped sticks. It was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I would have preferred more crispy bits.

My companions enjoyed their cocktails while I enjoyed my Asahi beer. Mira was stenciled into the foam on one of the cocktails. Nice touch.

The main feature for us was the dessert, El Huevo Malo. It's a hollow chocolate globe with coffee ice cream, honey comb, raspberry, and other treats inside. Think Easter egg. It was cracked open at the table by our server to reveal the contents. The coffee ice cream was strong, like an espresso shot. I liked it. The rest of the dessert was good but maybe didn't live up to the presentation.

Overall, it was a good evening, although not as good as I was anticipating. The portions are more like sharing plates (or tapas), not full meals and they're a bit pricey. So were the drinks ($15 for a cocktail). I might come back but it may not be my first choice.

3.5/5"}
{"text":"Ordered 3 apps, 2 mains, 2 desserts for three girls. Came moderately hungry and left super full. About 60-80 a person depending on if you grab a drink or not.

Started the meal with a Garden Cocktail on the house specialties list. I would compare this drink to a martini, as it is quite strong yet very fragrant and refreshing at the same time. The base for the drink is Pisco, a Peruvian liquor distilled from grapes similar to whiskey but not aged in barrels and therefore clear. 

For appetizers we got the Tostada Morado which is spicy cubed tuna. I really loved the cilantro crema as it really packed in flavour and is reminiscent of tuna poke. 

Got two ceviches on the waitress' recommendation, the trio and the Tiradito Hiramasa. The former contains a mild and creamy one, a fruity and tropical one and a spicy and flavourful one. The latter comes as thin slices on a very earthy sauce. Each slice is garnished with a small dollop of jam that goes fabulously with the fish. This one was a very light but refreshing flavour combo, no doubt Japanese-Inspired.

For mains we got the Cerdo (suckling pig) and Arroz con Setas (mushroom rice). I am more of a 'meat over seafood' person so the Cerdo was my personal favourite. It tasted similar to the Chashu slices you get on ramen but more tender with the bonus texture and flavour of crispy skin. The quinoa under it was also super good. The mushroom rice was a more mild flavour with really delicious fried onions and good backdrop for other mains.

For desert they had a limited-time feature which I don't remember the name of, but I believe it was a whipped goat cheese mousse with a fruity sorbet center and a crispy-crunchy bottom. The dish features Pacay, which is a fruit that tasted similar in texture and flavour to a Mangosteen. I was a huge fan of this mixture of salty and sweet, fruity and rich and crunchy and creamy.

We also got the El Huevo Malo which is the big chocolate ball most diners have already seen in a facebook video. This one was visually stunning but the previous dessert outshone the flavour of this one significantly.

Overall the meal was fantastic, the dishes inventive, the service was top notch and I would probably come again."}
{"text":"First time here and was not a great experience. Overall the wait for our dishes was very long. Unfortunately the waitress also forgot to add in one of our main dishes. The dishes are very small with no amazing wow factor and could use some additions. The wagyu beef only came with fried onion sticks and was overpowered with salt and needs something to compliment it. Of all the dishes we tried the beet salad was amazing, very light and refreshing. The reviews on yelp did not meet my expectations and they were out of chocolate balls! The specific dish I came here for. I would really rate Mira as 1 overall not great service and mediocre food."}
{"text":"This is the perfect place for outgoing foodie people who like to try new and flavourful items.

The type of groups I saw:
- date night
- girls bday dinner
- intimate friends' dinner

Being new to the Toronto restaurant scene (opened 2 months ago), our waitress was extremely knowledgeable in the food itself, the restaurant and the waitress was very professional. She offer many suggestions when we felt slightly overwhelmed by the menu. 

We initially came just for desserts, but ended up tasting a few apps before our \"dessert main course -el huevo Malo\".

Apps (beware they are tiny tiny-that's why I couldn't give it 5 stars):
- The Octopus was perfectly fried (like it was dipped for half a second) paired with a spicy sauce for a nice kick 
- Mira Ceviche, the fish was fresh and as well the whole dish was a great ensemble (cubes of sweet potatoes was a nice touch).
- Salmon teriyaki was flavourful (below was pool of sauce to dip/drench in) and not over-cooked with a nice body and juicy-ness in each bite.

Desserts:
- Cachangas Peruanas was like a dessert pizza on top of the lightly and crispy tostada and in top was a heavy topping of sweet and tangy flavours (sherbets, edible flowers, papaya, dragonfruit etc). Even tho this had no hint of chocolate in it, I was floored at how good it tasted all together!
- El Huevo Malo was the famous chocolate ball. Since it was all chocolate, this could easily be split between 3-6 ppl. The mouse was delicious was was the coffee ice cream sitting on top of a chocolate cake (which tasted more of a cake-y pudding texture). It was very sweet, so share it as much as possible!

Overall, I enjoyed my food experience here. The service and the atmosphere were added bonus."}
{"text":"This place is a truly hidden gem in the city. It is tucked down a side alley off of Wellington near Spadina. The place is quite small, so it would be a good idea to make a reservation, especially if you're a bigger party. The ambiance is dim and cozy, with a glowing hipster vibe. General crowd ranges for high power professionals, to fanny pack tourists and everything in between, though there were no children. The waitstaff is all super friendly, and very personable, they really try and connect with the guests. Food pacing is good, and definitely tapas style. 

I started with the Garden cocktail, which is super pretty with an edible flower floating on clear liquid, that tastes like a strong white wine.

We had: 
- Cerdo (the pork had a beautiful crispy skin, was tender and moist, and complimented beautifully by the rocoto jam - what rocoto is remains a mystery to me, and the not too starchy quinoa)
- Arroz con Mariscos (the squid and scallops were perfectly cooked, and the rice had little pieces of chopped up squid in it, with bright notes from the peas; this dish is very salty, but this was balanced by the pineapples soaked in honey and pink peppercorns that our waitress brought us! THANKS!!) 
- Pulpo (perfectly done squid, with tasty sauces, and tasty pieces of purple potatoe) 
- El Huevo Malo (instagram chocolate ball, this dessert really is a show in a dessert with being able to crack it open. It's huge, and other than the wow aspect, slightly disappointing. The sponge toffee inside is delicious, and the reasperry pieces are a nice touch, but overall, this dessert is prettier than it is tasty...but how could you come here and not try it?)
- Amor Con Coco (this was the show stopper with chocolate done in so many different textures, techniques and tastes, it was amazing! I would come back just to eat this dessert and HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!) 

My friend said that he had had many of the other dishes on the menu, and everything was spectacular, so I don't think you could go wrong with anything. This place does comes with a hefty price ticket though, so try and go with a small group if you want to try lots of things! I will definitely be back to sample the rest of the menu...and for the love of chocolate dessert! :D"}
{"text":"The food was amazing !!!! We ordered beet salad, main, chviche, and dessert. Everything was awesome"}
{"text":"Tough place to find but worth the trip

Bartender Devin took great care of us and was very knowledgeable.   Suckling pig was amazing and so was the short rib dish. 

Place was packed at 9pm on a Tuesday despite being hidden in an alley with no signage. People find good food I guess."}
{"text":"Mira is a new Peruvian inspired restaurant by Stuart Cameron, a great addition to the long list of fab eateries owned by ICONKINK. I had the pleasure of dining there on opening night with my siblings. We are all Peruvian and were eager to try Chef Cameron's take on our already delicious food. We were pleasantly surprised! We ordered as many dishes as we could (tapas style portions meant to be shared). We started off with the obligatory Pisco Sour and canchita. It's not easy to make a nice smooth Pisco Sour, but Mira's was simply perfect! Then we had the Mira and Nikkei Atun ceviches, the Pulpo (octopus), the concha (bay scallops), the yuca fries, the anticuchos, the Cerdo (pork), the Arroz con Mariscos (seafood rice), and two desserts: Picarones and Lucuma Mousse. The quinoa in the pork dish was unfortunately very salty. I loved that they had used the black quinoa as it has an extra special taste, but I could not enjoy it. The best dishes of the night: the ceviches and the seafood rice. The seafood rice were scallops sitting on squid ink rice, it was delicious. While most dishes were great, the desserts were not what we had hoped. The picaron (you only get one) had a strange sour taste, and was really missing the chancaca flavour that makes it special, and the lucuma mousse was good, but it did not go well with the sour passion fruit ice-cream on top.
The restaurant itself is beautiful in decor, mixing Peruvian elements into its already trendy style. The service is wonderful, our server Ty could not have been more attentive.
There were some hiccups along the way as expected on an opening night, but it didn't take away from our enjoyment.
I definitely recommend a visit, and I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Mira is one of those good-but-I-won't-be-back places. We had a good meal, but the hype around this place almost made it less enjoyable since it wasn't THAT great. We got:
- Ceviche Trio: Seafood was fresh, and there were varying degrees of sour (in a good way). For the price, I was hoping to get more. But of the 3, I liked the Nikkei Atun the most.
- Jalea Mixto: While this dish was presented beautifully with the fried fish bone, it wasn't as good as it looked. The breading was a bit too thick so the seafood ended up tasting pretty similar.
- Yuka fries: This was weirdly more creamy/milky than yuka fries I've had in Peru or other Peruvian spots here in Toronto.
- Costillas Anticucho: The short rib was nice and moist, and the sauce had a sweet base which complemented the saltiness of the meat. The hot plate it was served on was a nice touch, but it ended up searing the meat we couldn't eat quickly enough too much (i.e., some meat got seared into the plate so had a slightly burned taste when we ate it). Also, for the price, I was expecting more food.
- Arroz con Mariscos: This squid dish was my favourite of the night. The squid had good texture (not rubbery) and taste (really \"creamy\"), and the squid ink flavoured the rice really well.
- El Huevo Malo: Instagram worthy and pretty good - chocolate casing wasn't overly sweet, the icecream was nice (though such a small scoop), and the treats inside were fun to eat. Though after having it, I kinda wish I tried the other desserts instead.

Also, service was friendly and attentive, and the place had a nice casual vibe. It was a perfectly fine evening and meal. Mira just isn't a place I'd recommend if you expect more based on the hype or the price, and it isn't a place I'd come back to time and time again."}
{"text":"Lovely setting, great food. The vibe is amazing. The hostess was not very welcoming and cordial. But the food and service was excellent."}
{"text":"I found this wonderful little restaurant on Yelp, which opened only 3 months ago. My wife was a little hesitant at first because Peruvian cuisine means ceviche for her, and she knows my parents will not eat anything raw. But I assured her that the menu has a ton of cooked dishes. We ordered the octopus, yucca fries, asparagus, squid ink rice with scallops, suckling pig, short ribs, and mixed fried seafood. Everything was great, but we really enjoyed the squid ink rice, octopus, yucca fries, and the short ribs, which is actually sizzling steak on hot iron. For dessert, we had the chocolate egg and the Peruvian chocolate sampler (I'm using descriptive terms rather than the actual menu names because my Spanish is terrible and I'm lazy). My 9 year old foodie called the squid ink rice the best dish he has ever had and the chocolate ball just heaven! Our server was fantastic and enthusiastic (sorry, forgot her name). Although the place has a hip young vibe to it, she and rest of the staff made all of us feel comfortable and welcomed, from the 9 year old grandson to the 78 year old grandpa. They played excellent 80's music too! The restaurant is impossible to find from the street, so my one recommendation to the proprietors is better signage.  Otherwise, keep up the great work! If you're ever in Toronto, Check it out!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing! They serve a unique twist in Peruvian food. We ordered the Ceviche Trio, Duck, short ribs, Yuka fries and their very famous El Huevo Malo (The bad egg). Every item we had was delicious. The service was excellent! Our server made sure that we had a pleasant experience and ensured her station was spotless. The restaurant is quite pricey and portions are kind of small for what you pay for. Therefore, I would probably only come here for a special occasion. However, it is a restaurant I would come back to!"}
{"text":"I have talked about my experience at Mira so much that I'm beginning to annoy all of my friends. 

Aside for the mysterious walk to the restaurant, the vibe inside is so unbelievably cool that you immediately feel like the hippest person on the planet just by being there. 

We had the coolest server ever that made us laugh (we missed him when he was gone) but I have to focus my review on the food. 

Oh, the food....

Everything was top notch - tasty, flavor profiles fit for a king, well executed masterpieces but let me be more specific:

APPETIZER/CEVICHE/SIDES

- Ensalada de Remolacha (beet salad): 10/10 
      - Built like a piece of art, this was the tastiest salad I've ever had
- Pulpo (octopus): 9/10
      - Tasty beyond reason (1 pt deducted for the size/price)
- Mira Ceviche: 10/10
      - This was a very traditional ceviche that brought me back to Peru
- Nikkei Atun Ceviche: 10/10
     - Very spicy but excellent
- Yucca Fries: 9/10
    - They were good but one helping was enough

CARNE

- Chuletón (rib eye): 15/10
     - JUST ORDER THIS. ORDER THIS NOW
- Cerdo (suckling pig): 10/10
     - Order this too. The mix of sweet 'n' fruity with an asian glaze really works
- Pollito (chicken): 10/10
     - Very moist and delicious (the sauces it sits in just works)
- Arroz con Setas (mushroom rice): 10:10
     - This is almost like a paella but was very rich and earthy 

DESSERT

- El Huevo Malo: Experience 10/10, Taste: 8/10
    - It was worth getting just to see them crack it open (I've shown the video I took of the experience to everyone I know) but we actually would be fine with sticking to the savory items
- Mousse de Lúcuma: 8/10
    - Comes in the shape of an avocado - beautifully executed but again thought the tastes were okay.


Not to be dramatic, but I feel like I am a better person for having eaten at Mira. I will not believe anyone that tells me otherwise."}
{"text":"Mira no further for excellent dining! This is a Peruvian-styled restaurant that just opened up, the next creation from the head chef of Byblos/Patria. 

It's a little tricky to find - if you've been to Spin before, it's located right across from it. When Google Maps tells you you've arrived, that is the alley you should head down. 

We ordered the Mango Ceviche, the Ceviche Trio, the Tostado Morado, the Concha, the Yuka fries, the Cachangas Peruanas, and El Huevo Malo (the bad egg). 

The Mango Ceviche and the Ceviche Trio came out first and they were DELICIOUS. The Mango ceviche could have been dessert to be honest and has a very pleasant blend of flavours, leaving a refreshing aftertaste when you're done. The Ceviche Trio reminds me of ceviche from Peru, especially the Mira ceviche, which is more of a classic ceviche. The other two ceviches get progressively spicier and are great in their own right. 

The Tostada Morado is way better than I thought. The flavour is fresh and the food quickly disappeared. The concha was underwhelming based on the photos and the reviews, but it was still a warm, flavourful, and pleasant. Yuka fries are rich and heavy - while they're great, I would recommend you get something with them. 

We couldn't decide on one dessert - so we got two! Cachangas was on a fried pastry with ice craem, sorbet, and fruits sprinkled on it. The ice cream and sorbet is made in-house (you can really tell with how good the sorbets are) and the blend of pastry, fruit, and ice cream/sorbet is delightful. El Huevo Malo is the visual highlight, as the waiter brings the giant chocolate ball (egg) out and cracks it open for you. In the centre is a delicious blend of ice cream, chocolate, honey nuts, and some other things. Once you're done that, you can nibble away at the shell."}
{"text":"Finding that great date night or girls night out spot with decent food and ambiance isn't hard ... but finding a spot that great flavours that's a bit more challenging.  Mira takes some great cues from it's sister restaurant Byblos and Patria to form another good dining spot ... this time it's around the interesting Peruvian food that has a Japanese influence.

Mira entrance is hidden in plain sight.   It's just down the laneway between Wellington and King St and right across from SPiN Toronto.  There's no signage at all... the only way to know you're in the right place is the many different lit lanterns down a smaller alleyway to 2 doors.  You want to open up the one on the right side and not the one in front.  When you open it, you'll see directly into the kitchen and you notice quickly it's a modern vibe.  It has a playful atmosphere with low lights, the pin up girls, and artistic drawings in the large mural.  There's a huge bar on the opposite side.   Seating is elevated... so for shorties like me, prepare to hop up to the tall seats!

Service here is dedicated... after every dish, we had our waitress come and check out how the dish was, if we needed another drink, or if we had questions on what is on the plate.  Also, the servers who delivered the dishes took the time to go through every interesting ingredient on the plate.  Normally I dont think thats necessary but since Peruvian food is not a Toronto mainstream, this was really appreciated.  I would say that be prepared to be have a heavy push on the alcohol.  They will check up on you at least 5 times if you need more alcohol.  I get it that its what brings in the best mark up profits but it got too much after the 3rd ask in less than 15 minutes.  

The menu is great... there honestly is a lot of great items you can choose.  I could come back easily, not eat the same things, and still be intrigued on other items.  It is a shared plates concept so get to know your table mates well and be prepared to fight over some of the last bites.

Ceviche Trio - A beautifully laid out display came to our table and in the large platter sat 3 vibrant small plates.  It was pretty as the vibrant colours just popped.  Mira ceviche is a mild one that has a light fish, sweet potatoes, a nice but light citrus taste, and some of the roasted corn.  The Altamar ceviche had more spicier take but also more of a sweeter note instead of just citrus.  I found the grouper a bit more meatier in texture but still nice and tender.  Last one was the Spicy Salmon and it had a big spice kick.  Overall, great taster but I wouldnt use split this beyond 2 people.  You may only get 3 tablespoon per little dish.  4/5

Jalea Mixto - Go ask what the market price is for this... usually I fear that it'll be something ridiculous like $40 but this appetizer was a great offering at $18.  Arriving at the table was this artistic arch of the backbones of a fish deep fried.  Beneath the arc you can see pieces of scallops, octopus, a white fish, and calamari.  They were all cooked perfectly... deep fried, crispy hot exterior that holds very tender pieces.  Very well executed.  The dipping sauce is a nice touch to add to the dish.  I found the octopus and calamari to be really tender.  Great dish.  4.5/5

Ensalada de Remolacha - One of 2 salads on the menu and this one is for all those who love pickled vegetables.  This was great as the creamy goat cheese, honey, and nuts worked well with the lightly picked beets.  Visually it's so interesting as the beets take on a neon pink shade... don't adjust the screen, it's really that colour. 4/5

Tacú Tacú de Pato - A very interesting take on duck... it's aged so it's much more meatier and stronger in flavour before being cooked. It's cooked to a medium rare so for those who like a tender duck or one that is more cooked... this might not be your dish.  Beside the large ruby red duck breast sat a long rectangle of duck confit and fried rice.  Rice was interesting as it was a bit of a side filler but I did love they have large tender confit duck pieces in it.  3.5/5

Yucca Fries - I find yucca fries funny... often you fry them and you may get hollow fries.  It's a weird experience to eat fried air haha.  It does come with 2 sauces and they're needed.  Yucca by itself is not quite flavourful. 3.5/5

El Huevo Malo - Dessert... this is their most popular and most Instagramable one.  It's a large chocolate sphere that they crack open to reveal a scoop of coffee ice cream and flourless chocolate cake chunks hidden inside.  They paint the inside of the sphere with a cream and artistically place the honeycomb and more chocolate cake all over the interior.  Visually stunning and fun... also very filling as you get a lot of chocolate covered in cream.  Flavour wise, seems one dimensional a bit.  3.5/5

Following success of Byblos & Patria, Mira keeps it going with a fun sexy vibe, good service, and interesting menu that keeps you thinking what to try next."}
{"text":"One of the most memorable experiences in a while.  The ambiance was ultra hipster for an older crowd with an 80's playlist.  

Devon from the bar made my night.  His menu suggestions and knowledge of the food and drinks was superb.  I'd go again just to try his other choices.

Go for the chocolate trio dessert over the bomb.  The flavour and texture profile of the Amor con coco is unforgettable.  I'll always save room for this dessert."}
{"text":"Mira is a tapas style restaurant furnished out of a space that used to house a club. The *secretive* location makes it that much more fun to locate (not difficult at all), and the inside is swanky and classy. The open kitchen is a great touch that I think more restaurants should adopt. 

With a larger party of 6, we were seated at a high top table. We ordered a great selection from their menu, the bay scallops (delicious, slathered in butter), the grouper ceviche (best dish of the night) and tuna ceviche, the short rib (very tender, fell off the bone), the Cornish hen (decent, tender), the chicken heart skewers (very tasty), the wild mushroom arroz (very fragrant), the yucca fries (not bad), and for dessert, we had the el huevo malo (do not order more than 1, this is HUGE and way too sweet) and the picarones.

While everything was tasty, unfortunately nothing left a very lasting impression. The ambience is very upbeat and the servers are lively, friendly and knowledgeable and make for an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Hubby and I came here on our last night in Toronto and were really looking forward to the experience.

They do sort of pack you in which I'm always bothered by.  It didn't help that there was a young woman sitting right next to me who spent the next two hours talking NON-STOP about herself.  It also didn't help further when the things she was saying were nonsensical indulgent b.s.  Alas, her date who was likely trying to score with her just sat there benevolently agreeing with all the stuff she was saying. Oh, misguided youth! 

We distracted ourselves from the stuff involuntarily making it into our earholes with Mira's delicious drink and food offerings.  

Drinks:  Ms. Fitz, Villa Maria & New Standard - all highly recommended
Food:  Jalea Mixta (more for the presentation and delicious dashi-based ponzu sauce; the seafood was somewhat thickly battered.
Tuna Crostada:  Good and had a kick, definitely on the lighter side
Ceviche Trio:  Favorite was the nikkei atun but the other two were good, too.
Beef Heart:  Super tender, basted in like a mole sauce
Duck Breast: The duck was good but the fried rice that came with was even better.
Suckling Pig:  Must have. Period.
El Huevo Malo:  Order even just for the theatrics.  The girls next to us somehow managed to score a freebie dessert (cherimoya custard or something) but stared enviously at our dramatic black chocolate ball. This tasted almost as good as it looked.

Service from our main guys was a little tougher to come by.  There was an army of managers/bussers that were buzzing around but I felt like they were maybe understaffed, especially after our first server left and Ruiz took over.  He looked, at one point, overwhelmed and had to ask a manager to bring me the drink list after I'd asked for it a second time.  Other than that, everyone was super nice and friendly.

All in all, not a bad way to close out our vacay to Toronto."}
{"text":"I went with a friend for Peruvian food. We have dined at other Peruvian restaurants so we had an expectation about how tasty the food would be . Our expectations were met well with great service, fresh food and good portions.  Portions are just right as some restaurants either under do it or they over do it .  We got ceviche  trio and Yuka fries without cheese   as this was just a quick snack while   heading to an event later that day .  Our fries were done well with a crispy outside, golden brown and soft inside. The ceviches were full of flavor . We  plan to be back to try the Amor con coco dessert if we do a dessert crawl around the city ."}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY?!

Of course, the El Huevo Malo! The chocolate bomb that everyone is raving about online! Not only is it instagram worthy, it's really cool to crack your own chocolate egg/bomb. This dessert can feed a good 5 ppl! Because it's enough to share. It's really easy to make if you have the right moulding tool but it's still worth the try for your first time. Looks wise, really cool. Taste wise, it was okay. 

I honestly loved the savoury dishes more than the chocolate bomb! I enjoyed every dish I had at this restaurant too. So I don't think you'll go wrong ordering any of the dishes they have here! 

We were seated near the open kitchen so we got to see the some of the action inside the kitchen. The assistant general manager was also kind enough to go over the menu with us. We ordered everything he recommended from the menu! And without a doubt, he recommended some of his favorite dishes. 

I really liked the ceviche dishes we had. It had a nice citrus taste to the raw fish that wasn't too overpowering. I loved the beef tartare too. A spicy kick to the tartare made it extra tasty and the purple potato chip added the nice crunch. 

The decor of the restaurant was also very cozy. I loved the Colors they chose for the restaurant and the decorations they put up inside the restaurant. Some Peruvian elements such as fabrics and pictures on the walls, but it wasn't too much. 

This restaurant used to be a nightclub called f stop. So it's a hidden gem across from Spin ping pong club. It's tucked inside the alleyway behind the Shopify building so make sure you don't miss it! 

LAST TIP?!

The restaurant serves the dishes tapas style so make sure you order some dishes from all the different sections of the menu. They serve purple bread (really cool!) and it's great to dip your bread in the left over sauces from your dishes. Really absorb those juices and besides, you can order more of the bread too! Ask if they have a special dessert of the day because we got a dessert that they used an exotic fruit to make. It ended up being the best dessert I had that night! The dessert was made with the fruit cherimoya!"}
{"text":"Amazing!
Food , service and ambiance outstanding!!!!
Alex was our server/bartender as we chose to have dinner at the bar.
Our dinner and drinks were all of the recommendations of his 
My only complaint was we were unable to try more of his recommendations.
We left the restaurant so full and so satisfied.

I dine out frequently and in my opinion this is one of the best restaurants in Toronto 

This restaurant is a 10+"}
{"text":"Everything about the place is mediocre at best, more specifically the food.

We were a group of 6 so decided to try a bunch of things. 

A few specific things: 
Ceviche - mediocre, not enough citrus for me and one of the was too spicy to taste anything else. 
Concha - probably my favourite thing on the menu. I could have only eaten these. Warm and cheesy. 
Corazon anticucho - also very delicious . We got an extra because it was so good 
Pollito - I found this dry and unflavorful 
Cerdo - suckling pig, wasn't amazing. A little too fatty for my liking 
The wild mushroom dish - meh, I'm not a fan of mushrooms. Or this dish. 
Yucca fries - again not my thing, too grainy. I typically like yucca fries but not these. 

We had a couple other things, the portions are extremely tiny. I'd say not more than enough for 1-2 people. 

For dessert we had the picarones, these were alright actually. And the chocolate ball thing, looks really cool and is definitely Instagram worthy, however, it's not outstandingly delicious and I probably wouldn't order it again. 

The service is good, the restaurant is very tiny and condensed. 

I don't think I'd go back but it was cool to try."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  Very original presentation and flavors.  Great Pisco drinks and sauces for wonderful fish and meats."}
