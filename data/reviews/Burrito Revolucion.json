{"text":"Very good food and ambiance! The porc barbacoa burrito was excellent. The staff was very nice too. I'm definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I have to admit, I wouldn't go back. I've definitely had a better burrito in my life. More importantly, the service was honestly terrible. The woman serving us just seemed bored and didn't care to explain what some of the ingredients were, when we were clearly trying the restaurant out for the first time."}
{"text":"A sad place with sad mediocre franchise food. The staff appeared  unenthusiastic working there which I guess is understandable.  There are way better choices nearby."}
{"text":"I will never go back eating there. Burritos were so so, not tasteful. Food made me sick. We both had a food poisoning... Maybe food was not so fresh? I am very disappointed."}
{"text":"I was sketched out by the previous bad reviews but im happy to report that i was very satisfied here. A traditional approach to burritos with standard fresh garnishes and a few weirder offerings as well. Staff was very friendly and i was happy to find a nice offering of mexican beverages (modelo, jarritos, cocktails) + a wide selection of hot sauces. Clearly the owners have spent enough time in socal or mexico to know whats good. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place is a step above M4 but still misses the Chipotle mark. The ingredients are fresh and tasty-corona pork is great but avoid the \"ceviche\" which isn't very authentic. Interior is cute and clean. Prices are more reasonable than the BBQ burrito place a few blocks away. The service is the only issue here-ranging from inattentive and bored, to super friendly-Hit and miss on that front. Grab your food to go and avoid the hassle."}
{"text":"Je suis passée à un moment où il n'y avait personne vers 12h45, donc pas besoin d'attendre! J'ai choisi un burrito assez classique avec haricots noirs, salade, riz mexicain, sauce pimentée, sauce à la coriandre, un peu de chou et poulet chipotle. Pour accompagner le tout, j'ai choisi un Jarrito lime...autant vous dire que c'est super bon...et que je ne dirai pas non à une petite sieste... Le burrito est assez énorme. Hayyy que rico!!"}
{"text":"Quality isn't great, but price is cheap.  Went one, had a burrito bowl. Overall I've had tastier (eg. Tejano) but there was a lot of different ingredients to choose from, and everything tasted fresh. The size was good too, I eat fairly big portions and I was full after a large bowl.  I chose the tequila steak, but I don't recommend it. Didn't really taste like anything special.  FYI, there are a couple of 1 star reviews. I agree this place is not a gem, but no way does it deserve 1 star. I greatly doubt the integrity of those reviews (both profiles were created in the last week and left only 1 review?!)."}
{"text":"A place that I WOULD go to often, if only the customer service hadn't been so poor. The food is good, it's relatively cheap, and there's a nice terrace to eat it on. However, the staff is miserable... completely unenthusiastic. I wanted to leave halfway through ordering but figured I'd just stick it out. After getting out on to the terrace it was all smooth sailing, my buddy and I both got burritos and we were happy with them. Will I try it again? If I see different staff, otherwise, there are a other places to get a cheap burrito and a drink."}
