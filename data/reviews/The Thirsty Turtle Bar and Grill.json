{"text":"I've been a regular at this place since it was Petes peanut pub. Ever since the thirsty turtle this place has improved. They have good food. Servers are good. Dart boards are good. Nicole P I think is upset because her friend no longer works there. This is what i hear from some regular fellas over there. I was told she comes in and orders only water now as well. My kids act even more mature than this."}
{"text":"Honestly, use to love this place but since the departure of their best server/bartender, the place has gone nowhere but down hill. Service has become less than pleasurable with rude, slow service, and when you have to walk up to the bar to get a refill just to get ignored. Food has taken a turn for the worse with rock hard toast (at brunch) and so much excitement over the addition of a hotdog to the menu. New menu was to be out three weeks ago so current menu looks like a colouring book with black-lines everywhere. Bad enough when I, as the customer, had to explain to the waitress what was even on the menu when another guest asked, as she didn't know. Than add in the first Sunday NFL of the season and you put two new girls on, who unfortunately were not trained to work the TVs and have to have customers try and help out. I don't blame the staff, but question the priorities of management. Watched two four-tops, a three-top and our table of eleven leave to go watch the games else where. At least the pizza is still good, even though they took it away as a Sunday special.  Described in one word .... Broken"}
{"text":"Wow, this was the worst service I have ever received. Both from the server and the owner. Our beer tasted horrible and were flat, and when we complained about it, we were told that all the beers tasted like that today. The wings tasted a little off, I think they may have been old, they had a weird smell. The server was rude, and took a really long time to bring the drinks. Even water! At least 20 minutes, and only three tables occupied in the whole place. 
Came here for a Groupon like most people, it isn't even worth it with a Groupon, go to one of the other bars in the area, as they are all much better"}
{"text":"I totally disagree with Nicole, been there 3 times in the past month and really enjoying the new menu. The hot dogs are awesome. 
I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great meal at a good price and the service was very good."}
{"text":"Walk in the place smells like a dirty old mop not many people in there nothing going on very quiet try to get the waitress to serve your drink is a possible lot better pups in the vicinity than this place"}
{"text":"The service here sucked ball sack and our beer was so flat and tasted like a wet shart I would never recommend this place unless u want to taste wet shart and ball sack!!!"}
{"text":"Is this place closed? Permanently? I can't find a website nor is there an active phone number...????"}
