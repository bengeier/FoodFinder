{"text":"First Yelp review and first visit to Kiku's Markham location.  They also have a location in Don Mills  Great AYCE restaurant.  Very nice modern decor and attentive wait staff.  Each table has an iPad on which the diners can see a picture of everything on the menu and use the iPad to place their orders.   After ordering the iPad slides into a pocket under the table which gets it out of the way when the food starts arriving.     The menu is large and varied and with a few exceptions, everything was excellent.  Standouts included the tempura shrimp, the baked muscles and the hand rolls.  The only let downs were the rather bland breaded scallops and the Ika Yaki (whole grilled squid) which was over cooked and chewy.    Overall a great experience and a solid 4 out of 5."}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant. Nice decor - but very busy of course on a Saturday night but no place to wait for seats.. The service was very fast - you use an ipad to place and send your order.  There wasn't much variety of sushi and i have to say that the sushi wasn't very tasty.  Nothing special about it. Very bland and run of the mill. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Interesting concept of ordering from an ipad menu -- it makes the whole process of choosing foods efficient and hassle free. As for the actual food, the different kinds of meat we tried (chicken teriyaki, beef with enoki mushrooms and steak) were dry and overcooked. The sushi rice here is not as high quality as other AYCE sushi restaurants, and the cuts of fish and seafood are smaller and not as fresh as something from, let's say e.g, Sushi Legend. Waitresses were attentive but they often forgot our orders. Overall, would not recommend Kiku as there are better options out there."}
{"text":"I have been to Kiku twice now for buffet and it's time for a review.  First of all, the options in the buffet is fantastic.  There are a variety of sushi, ramen, grilled meats/seafood, and desserts to choose from.  The service is also relatively fast and you use the tablet to order so no waving over waiters and filling out tons of paper sheets.    The food is itself is just a-ok.  While the choices is plentiful, the quality is average at best.  Also, they do use a lot of msg in their foods, and generally, the food is on the oily side.  The main reason I only gave three stars is because the place just isn't that clean.  I noticed the plates and bowls aren't totally clean, and the seating area/tables could really use a scrub down as well.  All in all, for the decent price, it's a good choice when you want to sample lots of different foods, and try different flavors."}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious food ! Clean too. My favourite AYCE sushi place. Sweet shrimp and salmon sashimi are so good here"}
{"text":"Interesting place, it's pretty much the same as any other sushi buffet but you just order with an iPad. Food was alright, not everything was fresh and they over cooked my steak strips. The decor was nice, I think they didn't change much from the previous restaurant that was there before it. Just a tad bit too expensive based on the food and service I got."}
{"text":"Food was okay, they missed a couple of my orders and service needs some work."}
{"text":"Have been here numerous times. Pretty sure this will be my last time here. Quality has gone way down. Prices have gone up. Not worth it!!"}
{"text":"First time at this buffet.  Decor and ordering of food wss pretty good.   Food quality is as expected for a buffet.   The dish that stood out the most,  is the beef tataki.  This was by far the best beef tataki I ever had at a buffet.   And I visited many jap buffet in my life. I think we ordered 60 slices in total.   Our first round of food came out very quickly.  I can't say the same for our second and third round.     Dessert was pretty much standard as well.  Nothing really exciting and nothing really special.   Price was about $30 a person (after tax and tip).  Would I come back... I don't think I would.  I rather go to Tenichi our Yamamoto.  Speed of service was not good."}
{"text":"3.5/5 ~ Nice ayce sushi restaurant with the ipad ordering menu. Gets quite busy on weekend evenings so do make reservations. Everytime I have been here the food always came out really fast and they have only missed an order just one time. They have quite an extensive menu. The sushi/sashimi is pretty good and fresh. One of my favorite items is the grilled mussel with a nice cheesy sauce. Was quite dissapointed with the steak teriyaki though. It was too chewy and bland. Love the deep fried milk and banana, although just one time it was still cold inside. Also have to pay extra for refillable soft drinks.  Definately returning to eat here as this is one of the better ayce sushi restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"This is my favourite sushi joint uptown. The food is good, the selection satisfies my requirements, and the iPad ordering makes things just way too convenient.   They have a wide variety of sushi, rolls, sashimi, noodles, udons, ramens, skewers, and dessert to choose from.   I would recommend the salmon sushi and Rose sashimi ( that is a perfect balance of sashimi, rice, and mayonnaise in the shape of a rose)."}
{"text":"This is an update to a previous review, and I have to say quality has dropped, both here and the York Mills location. We were kicked out b/c we ordered too much food, which defeats the purpose of AYCE . Servers were attentive to remove any finished plates but never refilled our glasses once in a while (the York Mills location did). The food is good but anything that's noodles is tasteless and bland both the soups and pan fried dishes. Servers were friendly however which was something the York Mills location lacked ( server threw placemats and plates across the table to my friend.) Everytime I visit, I love this place less. I know it's an AYCE restaurant with cheap prices but compared with previous visits I may come less here."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nice. Ordering on iPad makes it easy, and the pieces came in the amount that was ordered, unlike other sushi places that often bring fewer. Some of the orders took a long time to come, which was frustrating because I would've wanted to have my appetizer at the start of the meal not when we are about to pay the bill.  The sashimi was very fresh, cut in little pieces that's half the size you would've got in other places.   It was a pretty hot day and the air conditioning is not working properly because the restaurant was very hot. That's the only downside. There's quite a wait on a Monday night at 7:30 too."}
{"text":"This place is terrible...all the sashimi is not fresh at all except salmon. It's got that fishy taste and the colour seems rather dark. Other foods are decent.   The dessert is probably the worst, the creme brulee smells like rotten egg and I didn't even bother eating it. The ginger milk, they literally put a ginger on top of steam milk and add some sugar water on top.   The service is not that great either even though I usually don't expect much from AYCE places. So my gf asked for a separate cup for some tea and the waitress just ignored her and pour tea in her cup that had water in it. lol...  The only thing that's good about this place is the interior and the iPad ordering system. I recommend you to go to other AYCE sushi places."}
{"text":"This is one of the restaurants which give you good good value, but the food quality and booking experience are inconsistent.  ... Why?     We have been there four times , with various size parties, and in different dates.   WEEKEND EXPERIENCE:  Never go on weekends , it is a zoo, and the service is hit and miss. The food...ummm.. Is definitely not a hit, and more a miss. You will have to make sure you know what you have ordered  through the fancy high tech tablet.  After a while, you don't really care what they put in front of you...because  You waited for an hour and became a starving monster.  The lamb Skewer and beef were dry , the tempura were even drier... The only safe bet was their sushi.   WEEKDAY it is okay but if you called for reservations on a Friday (say 530 pm, still a week night), the fellow Johnny may tell you that they are fully booked and their first reservation is at 8 pm. We decided to drive over and got a seat immediately. This happened twice to us so we learned the drill.   They will tell you that it is an one and half hour meal duration ...which is okay because the food delivery is very fast.   Overall the food is good for the value in a week night. Still order Sushi and you will be fine.   Our favourite food are: tempura , lamb skewer, galbi (weekday), octopus, Kiki roll, rainbow roll, spicy salmon hand roll, arugula with tuna ...  Oh.. Desert ? They are the same regardless of which night you visit. Pint size puddings and ice cream. I won't recommend the fried  banana or milk  unless you did not get full from the buffet!    Green tea ice cream is our favourite. What would a sushi dinner be with it green tea ice cream !   Overall we are happy with the place... Oh. Forgot to tell you at they have a sit down tatami room but the kids are not well controlled....it became a bit of a hazard ...   The service is good but not attentive...I think they should put a 10% for tables over 4 so that the servers can get a decent wage....."}
{"text":"Food is average, service is very poor. After missing big part of order no one even cared to explain and we had to wait an hour to get the ro?ls. Staff are un-proffesional with little English knowledge...typical!"}
{"text":"I love the setup here. They have an all you can eat option which, if you come for lunch is $14.95. Very good price for the amount of food you get! The options are endless. They have a menu which you can an unlimited amount of ramen noodles, kalbi short ribs, spring rolls, sushi, miso soup etc. The sushi part of the menu has plenty of options which are great to try. The ambience of the restaurant is very classy and comforting. The staff is very attentive and friendly. Will definitely have to come back again."}
{"text":"Its my first time here with the family enjoying ayce jap buffet. The place around here is always busy with ppl (Richmond Hill) love to eat out a lot I guess. The menu is quite extensive. Their seating is pretty nice for an ayce and they have an Ipad ordering that you can control how much and how many orders you like to send, or call the server over.  What really stood out for me was, no matter what we ordered and how much, they brought it out quite fast. The servers were very polite and clean up all the mess right away. Its prob one of the better service we received at an ayce as well. I wish I can indicate all the food we've ordered, but you can check out the website to see how captivating it is. After tax pp is about $32!!! Usually that is quite pricey, but I would allow this once in a while treat b/c this place does it well."}
{"text":"2nd time at this restaurant, and service was horrible! You refer all your foods on the iPad which is kind of cool, but with all Japanese restaurants there's always a question of \"did we order this?\" 2 seconds later another order of the same foods came so impulsively I tried asking the server if there was a double order then she snapped at me! She yelled at me angrily and said \"you guys always say you didn't order! You ordered all of this!!!!!\" In Chinese Then she slammed our plates down and walked away. I was extremely shocked! Clearly she was having a bad day or upset and my question triggered her, but there is never a right reason to yell at customers! I'm so upset and I will never return to this restaurant again!"}
{"text":"Order using iPads. Fast and accurate. Good food with large selection and comfortable seatings."}
{"text":"I come to Kiku sushi every weekend with my family. Fast service, great foods, nice place.  What more you can ask for?!"}
{"text":"This is my go to place for sushi. It is always fresh and very tasty.  The service is quick when ordering from the ipad but the servers are not personable and you almost have to wave a flag at them before they come to your table if you want to get their attention. Hats off to the chefs because the food is great."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with some co-workers last week.  Place is pretty busy.  As others have mentioned, all the ordering is through the iPad so no more flagging waiters.  Food came relatively quickly and was pretty much hit and miss.  Not great but not terrible either which isn't saying much but for AYCE, I guess it's ok(?).  We ordered a wide variety of things on the menu which is good and because it's AYCE, we can order more if we wanted to of anything.  Good for people wanting to try lots of different things as you can literally order one piece of calamari or 1 chicken wing.    Dessert was pretty good I have to say, lots of variety again and portions are small so you can try a bunch of stuff.    So we ended up paying about the same as any other non AYCE place but have more variety of average food.  But that's not really different than another other place is it?  The iPads are cool."}
{"text":"Pretty decent bad sushi which I visited on a recent trip to Toronto. But I'm on a mission to implore restaurants to clean their bathrooms. Seriously if the heigh throughput sushi doesn't make you sick the fact that each patron is dragging human feces into the room will."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ended up here on a last minute whim on Valentine's Day. Last minute because the restaurant that we had reservations for failed miserably, and after waiting over an hour for our food to arrive and receiving terrible service, we decided to just walk out and leave. This is something I rarely agree to do.   After about 10 minutes of waiting in the crowded entrance of Kiku, we were seated by Johnny the supervisor. I usually don't go out of my way to recognize servers, but Johnny was simply amazing - funny, efficient and professional. He treated us like VIP guests every time he came by even while trying to juggle a million other things. When I advised him of my gluten sensitivity and asked him for spicy mayo since I can't have soy sauce, he told me something I've never heard at an AYCE: we have gluten free soy sauce.   Within minutes of submitting our orders in the iPad ordering system, food was making its way to our table. Nothing was missed, everything was surprisingly tasty and fresh despite it being an AYCE. After a disappointing and discouraging would-be dinner experience at a $54-a-steak restaurant, we were more than impressed at the level of service and efficiency that Kiku delivered.   This dinner experience made our night and we will be back. Thank you Johnny!"}
{"text":"Speedy AYCE with generally good service. They also have Ipads at each table to take orders. More importantly, the orders don't take a long time to arrive and orders are not lost in the process.   The food is also pretty decent- both the sashimi and sushi are pretty fresh. The rolls are not loaded with chunks of rice which is a plus.I would recommend trying the grilled beef strips as it literally melts in your mouth. The only thing that was lacking quality were their desserts, it was either too sweet or lacking flavour. Of course with the exception of green tea and red bean ice cream because you really can't go wrong with them.  Be mindful that drinks are charged additionally. Soft drinks are refillable for free however, so they will only charge you for the initial cup. This place also gets really packed by 6pm, I would highly recommend making RSVP. They also have a 2 hour limit which is pretty standard. With tip and tax, each adult is around $30 which is also the norm for AYCE. Overall, I would recommend trying it out."}
{"text":"Food tasted terrible, my udon came out ten minutes after my girlfriends and was luke warm. I got the udon and it was tasteless and smelt like chicken noodle soup. The washrooms were filthy that I wouldn't want to touch anything in that place. Definitely do not suggest going there."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great prices and a guaranteed positive experience every time I go. Hands down, this is one of my favourite ayce sushi places in the Markham area."}
{"text":"If there is 0 star in comments, they deserve a closure. Terrible customer service I ever had. A very very bad experience. We have a farewell party of 20 peoples and walked in around 9 (we booked table for 8:45). If you are rushed to close please let us know up front or even we taking our reservation. We can only order food for one round and right at 9:45, they told us to order it as it last call for kitchen even for dessert. The food came for our last order around 9:55 and they start to turn off the light and cleaning up our table. They even keep asking for payment for at least 5 times as we were eating. We not even finished the drink and they just took it out. There was a children on the seat and they just took out the table in front of the children without any apologize. I used to  be here for dinner with family, friends and company party but not anymore."}
{"text":"Service was slow, half our orders didn't come out and we received last call only 1.5 hours after we started. For a group of 7 this was just not enough time. Terrible... just terrible!"}
{"text":"Giving this place one star is already a complement... I've never been this angry eating at a sushi place. Sushi always makes me happy except Kiku... So it was lunch rush when we arrived, around 12:30. The place was packed. I'm trying to think of one good thing to say about this place and I can't , well maybe except for the nice modern decor left behind by the previous owner. Anyway, service was VERY slow. They use iPads for orders and it shows the time you place your orders. My first few plates came in 20 min, n every 15 min I'll get a few more.. And the maki rolls that I ordered from the beginning never showed up even after reminding them a few times. Service was BAD. Seems like the staff only know how to throw dishes down onto your table , and they don't put it down in front of you, they put it at the far corner from where you're sitting and you have to reach out to grab it. The lady sitting next to my table tried to ask the servers questions but got ignored twice, the worse part was the servers heard her but chose to ignore her... Unacceptable. The quality of the food was so bad I felt so offended. The salmon rose was tiny... The nigiri were on a diet, they are as skinny as my fingers. The sashimi on top was warm. The sirloin steak was like rubber , same with the diced beef cubes. The tea, which was kept in a thermal tea pot ... Was cold. How?!? The servers were busy, but I don't feel sorry for them. It's the management/owners fault , knowing they would be this busy but decide not to hire more people and also not train the staff properly. The staff hate their job, it shows on their face. They just drop my dishes down on my table and quickly run off to drop more dishes off at other tables, they never smile... I will never ever come back. Half way through my meal there was a crowd building up at the front door waiting for tables... I really wanted to tell them not to waste their time. Food, service, price, they all suck. 35$ for mom and I. I put down 40$, wanted to get change back, but the server decided to not give us change at all and thinks their service deserves a $5 tips. I was very very angry throughout this whole meal... I can't believe all the 4 stars rating that I'm seeing. Maybe I'm just unlucky today, but seriously... If you have no expectation and only want a fully belly then yes, eat here. But I deserve better so I'm staying far far away from Kiku. It gives a baddddd name to AYCE."}
{"text":"have been there for many times. before we just finished our food quickly and left, so i didn't notice the service. but this time, we wanted to talk and enjoy our time. when we spent about two hours, we notice the waitresses were so weird! later, one of them threw the bill on the table and said it would be our last call. we asked her whether the restaurant almost closed. she said the time limit was one and half hours, and we  spent two hours. i was shocked. btw, they always threw the plates on the table, and collected the empty plates slowly. bye, never see you again"}
{"text":"Very disappointed!  poor services,  dirty environment.  I reserved a room for party of 12.  We don't get services for 15 minutes.  The waitress was very rude.  She deliberately throw the dish on the table.  Orders were mess up.  Some foods were very salty.  I give the food 4 out of 10.  You can find a much better sushi restaurant in Richmond Hill and Markham area."}
{"text":"Food: Good quality, matches images (I wish there were descriptions on the iPad menu though)  Interior of Restaurant: Very nice on the inside can't complain, don't feel cramped even when the restaurant is full.  Service: The waiting area is sort of small and can get crowded and disorganized. However the host somehow manages to keep customer flow up. It would be easier if they had the \"table ready beepers\" though, for both customers and the hosts."}
{"text":"I like the place, orders were delivered to out table promptly.  Been there a few times with friends, food was always yummy, portion is on the smaller side, but since we had AYCE, can always order more !     Price is a bit more than avg AYCE Japanese I have been to, but it is money well spent, and it is like a few bucks more, no biggie."}
{"text":"Ordered 50 items for weekday lunch and had a blast."}
{"text":"Don't go to Kiku. All food quality aside, their service doesn't even deserve 1 star. They close at 11pm, but at 1030, they're practically mopping the floor at your feet to get you out. This is not a one-time off experience. We gave this place a second try, and the same thing happened. We felt so pressured, we left before some of our ordered items came. If the owner reads this review, maybe you should just consider changing the closing time, instead of pressuring your customers to leave."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here for lunch on Friday and we were seated pretty quickly as we were one of the first customers to come in. When we started ordering the food, it came quickly but we immediately noticed the quality of the food was very poor. The sushi wouldn't stay together due to the rice not sticking like it's supposed to.   Near the end of our meal, we ordered salmon that never showed up. A male server then proceeded to come to our table and ask us if we wanted to order any more food because they were doing last call. This was a surprise to us as we knew lunch ended at 3pm and it was only around 1pm. We were then almost forced to order dessert so we reluctantly did so. After our dessert came and we started eating it, the salmon FINALLY arrived. While we were eating our dessert, servers kept coming by rudely interrupting our conversation to try to clear our table and hovered around our table waiting for us to finish. The first male server that approached us then rudely interrupted us and asked us to pay before we even finished our dessert.  Overall the food wasn't good, and we felt extremely rushed because we were not informed of a time limit for our meal. Even if we had been informed of a time limit, the way the staff approached this was completely unprofessional. We made a unanimous decision not to eat here again. Go to a different sushi restaurant for all you can eat sushi and save yourself the disappointment."}
{"text":"$15 for all you can eat lunch. A little pricier compared to other AYCE places but the quality is a lot better. Plus, I love the fact that I can place an order through a tablet without having to flag down the wait staff and not having to worry about if I chose the right thing."}
{"text":"The place is constructed in a new, more technologic way. The menus are in the form of an iPad; you click what you want, then click for when the servers should bring it to you.   The food itself was also pretty good. Don't be afraid to try the meat, its nice and tender. You just keep ordering, and it just keeps coming, so its nice.   Here's why I'm only giving it 3 stars. Their website promised 15% off in the opening weeks. My friends went there a week ago and got their discount. We went, and they pretended to say that it didn't exist except for cash. It seems as more people start coming in, the more arrogant the management becomes."}
{"text":"The food here is quite decent.  A must try is the chef tar tar. Some other unique items that are not available elsewhere  I have been here several times, but today the service was beyond the type of slow you would expect in an all you can eat place. I can accept that 15% of the orders won't show up on a normal day, that is expected when you come to a place that churns out mountains of food.   Today, I would suggest that 30% of what we ordered never arrived even after multiple inquiries. It may have been a one off time where service was exceptionally poor, but it has been noted.  I would typically give this place between 3-4 stars."}
{"text":"My family and I visited this restaurant for a weekend dinner.  We heard they use iPads to order so we thought it was cool enough to check out. The system actually works really well. You get to check all the food you want to eat with a big picture to give you an idea of what you're ordering. The system is smooth, each time you click an item you see the food that you ordered and even after it arrives it still stays on the system (maybe to remind you of how much weight you need to lose after haha but I do appreciate it). I do wish though that the menu would give you a description of the item. For example, I would like to know what's inside a \"dragon roll\" rather than take a guess by looking at the picture (maybe I see eel? Nope. Crab meat.). The biggest issue I have is with the service. Maybe due to the fact that everything is automated, I barely made eye contact with any servers and most of them didn't say a word to us. They would come reach over and just grab an empty plate or drop one off. One of them literally reached over and took a plate from my mom while she was still eating. I was so shocked the sushi almost swam off my chopstick. But the food did come fast once you ordered them.   The food was good, nothing special. We order a lot of the \"special rolls\" and nothing was really special about each roll. There was a nice mango one that was sweet and sour but not for everyone. A bit heavy on the rice (my parents kept on complaining that we got ripped off since I ordered so many rolls. Whoops) The dessert had a nice selection, not just your ordinary ice cream but had different jellos (jelloes?) and mouses.   I would come again but I do hope to interact with my servers a little bit especially if they expect you to pay the tip. Nice and close to where I live and the iPad gimmick is nice (maybe it'll wear off but who knows. In easily entertained)."}
{"text":"Great place for gathering with your friends and family, even with many little kids. Food selection is good.  Actually deliver what you order, and they bring it fast!  Great restuarant"}
{"text":"We stopped going to Kiku for some time now - since last year.  However, we decided to give this place one more try and had our Mother's Day celebration there.  We quickly recalled all the reasons why we stopped coming to this place: poor service, poor quality and the salmon sashimi did not taste fresh.  They are really skimpy with the food, everything is sliced supper thin.  Since it was Mother's Day weekend, of course there was a time limit.  They certainly are not afraid to rudely tell you that \"your time is up\".  As we were paying we had a female server come into the room and started speaking in Mandarin (of what I believe is to tell us \"times up\") and when she realized that none of us understood Mandarin she walked away.  Not soon after did another server come by and started to shout at everyone to hustle.  I have never seen such rude conduct by a server before at any restaurant that I have visited.  Needless to say that this is absolutely the very last time that we step foot inside this place. Horrible, horrible experience.  You couldn't pay me to eat here."}
{"text":"People line up here at peak dinner time. Freshness is pretty good due to high volume. Tasty is worth Yelp 4 star.  But don't expect real Japanese sushi quality at this all you can eat style place."}
{"text":"Consistently great for many years. Good service and genuinely good food. I-pad ordering from your table is very convenient and quick. Their miso soup is authentic. Great variety to try out with their all you can eat service."}
{"text":"This place is so good I've been here numerous times!! Love the iPad menu and their decorations :) their service is fast and friendly usually"}
{"text":"Came here for birthday. The iPad menu is really interesting, but find it a bit tedious upon discovering that the waiter needs to come and confirm it (not sure if it was a system error that has particularly happened on the day I visit, or it was like that).   Sashimi is average, good selection and the steak / beef ribs are good. Deserts are good too."}
{"text":"Sure it was a long weekend and very busy, but the service was the worst I ever experienced. It was so bad I cannot remember how the food tasted."}
{"text":"I went for lunch with my 10 year old granddaughter who loves sushi.  I liked the food, the service and the ambiance.  It was clean, the food was good and the service was reasonable.  We had the \"all you can eat\" lunch, and ordered only a little too much.  I will go again."}
{"text":"This place is one of the worst ayce sushi places I've been to.  The food was average at best, within 15-20 mins of sitting down they told us the was a time limit for the table. The worst part was after when we wanted to complain to the manager after our meal they treated my friend and I like we were going to dine and dash."}
{"text":"I've been here many times and every time I go, the \"server's\" treat the customers like they're prisoners who need to be fed. It's a shame because the food is AMAZING. It makes me mad when I go to a place for the great tasting food but the service is horrible.  Sometimes, I try to overlook it but the last time I went, one of the server's just tossed my plate across the table. It was ridiculous. Non of the server's smile at you or even give you the time of day, very unfriendly and cold.   We are customers who pay to eat at your franchise, so please the least you can do is be civil and treat everyone with some patience and dignity.  It doesn't matter if the restaurant is busy. What makes a good restaurant is one that can handle the stress and still serve every customer the best they can.   I never expect too much from servers when I go to restaurants anyway because I know things can get tough, but it's still no excuse for the consistent negligence."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on Sunday.  Service was fast. Food was fresh and good enough flavour.  Nothing extraordinary.  The serving was the usual where you order a certain amount of an item and they bring less.  I had a problem drinking from their cup.  It stunk of bleach and distorted the taste.  Next time I will carry my own cup."}
{"text":"Pretty good all-you-can-eat japanese restaurant. The ordering is done via iPad, so there is no mix up as to what you order - this is sometimes a problem at other places. The waitresses seem to dress up in a sort of maid-costume which is a plus if you are into that. Decor and restaurant are pretty good overall."}
{"text":"I like their dishes, Sushi is fine, but the staff are impolite, they may take the Ipad out of your hands, or if you don't like the taste of one dish, they told us they are going to charge extra bucks unless you eat it! terrible staff and service."}
{"text":"Overall: - a nice atmospheric interior design setting  Service: - can order from an iPad  - some orders got mixed up between different tables"}
{"text":"This place is a pretty good all you can eat sushi restaurant. We went here based on the reviews from yelp. We went on a Saturday night and the place was PACKED! Unfortunately the hostess was very busy and wasn't keeping good track of who was next in line. After hearing \"you are next\" and then watching them seat someone else a couple times and nearly just giving up and finding somewhere else to go we finally got our table.  It turns out I'm glad we stayed. The service of food and beverage was pretty fast considering how busy they were.   Love iPad menus, they had a great selection of food and it was decent as well. The only food that needs lots of work is the deserts! They were pretty awful!! The creme brûlée was nasty, it tasted like scrambled eggs.   Overall decent experience!"}
{"text":"They are one of the best restaurants I've ever been to the iPads send what you want to eat really fast and usually it is really busy so I reserve spots a day before so I don't have to wait to long some days there is like decent amount of people once they put it on the newspaper their were people waiting in line in the morning some people even got angry since they were waiting in line a long time everything on the menu is fantastic"}
{"text":"AYCE optional Japanese restaurant, with a very wide selection. Our selections included a variety of sushi, tempura, deep fried and other delights... and everything was fresh, hot (except for the sushi, of course) and delicious.   I love this place!"}
{"text":"They have simpler rolls and a slightly more limited selection but they really load on the sashimi in rolls and stuff"}
{"text":"This place was clean. They have the iPad service. Which is cool because you can see what you are ordering.  Their service was good but they didn't bring couple of the items we ordered and everything That wasn't sushi was in very small portions. Like their seaweed salad or their sweet shrimp.  Overall I would go back there again."}
{"text":"Kiku is one of the more decent AYCE offerings in uptown. I've been here on many occasion and every experience was great. The fish is fresh, and there isn't too much rice packed in the sushi. The maki rolls also didn't have that much rice and contained a ton of fillings, which is awesome for an AYCE. Really good kalbi ribs too! Service is great - prompt, quick, and straight to the point. Our server (forgot his name but he seemed like the \"big boss\" there) was amazing! He made sure we got all our dishes and brought out whatever was missing. Will be returning again!"}
{"text":"Food came quick, but an order or two never end up coming. I find that if you order multiple quantities of sashimi, they just slice it thinner. Didn't really appreciate the last call when you're only 50 minutes in. It wasn't even near their closing time."}
{"text":"Ordering from the tablets is a great idea, very easy to use and pictures of every item made the ordering process very fun. It was expensive but the quality was good and the speed was amazing. Asking for water we had to wait for a waitress to come by . The should have flashing lights by the stalls so you can call them with the ipad. :-)"}
{"text":"I come here for lunch but pay the dinner price to get the dinner menu. The menu is quite large and everything on the menu tastes great. Non of the food is too oily or filled with MSG.   The sushi is fresh and made very well, the amount of rice is not overwhelming.   I would go here sometimes but it isn't the best place in the area."}
{"text":"One of my fave all you can eat sushi restaurants. Speedy service, tasty food, great variety and friendly staff. Giving it 4 stars tonight because we had a really rude waitress - she was walking across with a platter while we were getting up to leave - my 3 year old son was on the adjacent side leaving her plenty of room to walk across. She froze and looked at me as if my son was still in her way. I stood there wondering what else I could do as he was not blocking her path. I moved him an inch and she huffed and puffed. As she was coming back, my son was still in the same place - she stood there again for a few seconds, let out a loud sigh and muttered loudly for me to hear (in mandarin) \"These stupid kids\" and walked away annoyed, whispered something to waiter infront of us. Pity because the rest of the staff  have always been great with my kids."}
{"text":"What they do NOT have: good (or even passable) service, exceptional food, fancy presentation or utensils, clean and immaculate place, great ambience...  So why do I and my family keep going back to this spot, weekend after weekend? Because honestly, when I want AYCE sushi, I don't look for any of the above. All you need to know is that food here comes extremely quickly and in immense quantities, they never miss an order because of iPad ordering (and no need to flag down waiters every time), the variety is excellent (especially at lunch - they have quite a few rolls and sushi that I wouldn't expect for lunch at usual AYCE restaurants). Make sure to starve beforehand so you can stuff yourself here ;)"}
{"text":"Customer Service (1/5)  Terrible service - they rushed us to leave even though tables weren't full. There's no line up so why the rush? Overall, rude and not attentive during dinner service.    Food (2/5)  Food quality was sub par. Not worth coming here when Tenichi and Matsuda are all relatively the same price that offer better quality."}
{"text":"BEWARE!!  everyone raves about this restaurant but honestly...going once is enough. some of the food they serve is so careless and disgusting, especially the noodles and the meat. sushi is mediocre.. but the ABSOLUTE WORST PART OF THIS RESTAURANT IS THE SERVICE. an older man practically screamed at my family for sitting down at a table on my mothers birthday. there was no one to greet us at the door and bring us to a table and there was no servers in sight. the restaurant has just opened and so there was no one in there. reserved tables had the signs on it so we evidently chose a table that was not reserved. ...HE SCREAMED AT US. extremely rude!! also, the waiters and waitresses are extremely rude and it looks like they hate their jobs. they practically drop or throw the plates of food onto your table. I asked for napkins and spoons and the same older man literally. I mean LITERALLY threw it at us. he put us in a bad mood for the rest of the meal. on my moms birthday."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite sushi places as in quite strict about quality of food. I really enjoyed the concept of ordering my sushi on the iPad. Sometimes they miss an order here or there but it is great with no pressure and you can simply click on what you like and the food is there shortly.  The quality of the food here is quite high compared to other sushi joints. There's a huge selection of sushi's and sashimi's and other items if you're not into the sushi stuff. I brought many friends here and everyone has been quite satisfied.  I would highly recommend to make reservations towards the weekends and nights as it gets quite busy and can result in long waits.   The customer service is usually pretty good but sometimes you will get someone or a waiter does not speak any English. Generally asking for the manager or someone else will get you someone who can assist you in a timely manner."}
{"text":"Really good for all you can eat. Went for lunch had Salmon rose and dynamite rolls and spicy salmon sushi. Fresh fish. Order on iPad, barely any contact with staff which was a nice change. Also nice decor and soft seats"}
{"text":"Decent place for all you can eat. The environment is nice although I prefer the window seats behind those drapes since it feels less crowded there. I enjoyed kiku rolls as well as the mussels. The sashimi were mostly average."}
{"text":"Prob one of the easiest and fastest AYCE sushi places. Food seemed fresh. Pretty good variety of cooked and raw food. The grilled mushrooms w butter, Salmon Pizza and Japanese Eggplant were my faves. Salmon & White Tuna Sashimi were also good."}
{"text":"Not better or worse than others ayce, the pros here is that you can put in your order using the iPad, so that there will be less mistakes and missing order. But the fish here were not very fresh. Had a little stomach problem for couple days, so I don't think I will be back."}
{"text":"My favourite ayce restaurant! The food is amazing and there are many things to choose from, there are pictures of the items so you can see what they are, which is great. The only bad thing is that you can't see if all your food has came. The service is alright. Sometimes you have to wait a long time for your item. But overall amazing place to eat!"}
{"text":"I had a decent lunch at Kiku on Sunday. The interior decor is very attractive and I was happy to see one of my favourite servers. She had previously worked in Brampton and Mississauga.  The sushi that I had for lunch was rather standard; however, there were several interesting seafood items that included mussels including a soup. The grilled pork on a skewer was excellent, so I ordered more. The beef with garlic was a disappointment. It was dry and cold when it reached my table.   I won't go back often because it is out of the way for me, but I will return."}
{"text":"This will probably be my first and last time here.  We came at 9 pm, their closing time was supposed to be 10:30pm, however, we feel like rushing out. They turn off half of the lights and start cleaning and mopping around 9:30pm on a Wednesday night. And of course our bill came immediately after. For a price of $30/ person, the food was average, most of the AYCE restaurant offers similar food or better . Salmon fish head came cold, ice cream melted. The service was bad, waiter ignores you when you call them, I guess they are rushing to close. They don't take away your dishes immediately but instead, they wait for a stack from every table, and they push their trolley on the aisle and take everyone's dishes at the same time, like how they do it on the airplane. I also don't like the decor, very open area with tables side by side like a open cafeteria. I guess for the price, many other ones will give a letter feeling and food."}
{"text":"Worst AYCE ever. None of the food items match the images on the menu (The spider roll is the most obvious offender here). The larger the serving of rice that an item contains, the faster it will arrive to the table, and vice versa for the opposite. Sashimi is shaved paper-thin and its freshness is poor even for AYCE standards.  If not for my parents' spontaneous decision to come here, I would never be caught dead in this dilapidated husk of what used to be a decent AYCE joint. Cost optimization has reared its ugly head once again."}
{"text":"Been there for numerous times already lol. The food  are not the best but decent. The place is pretty spacious and have lots of booths which are neat and comfortable. Make sure when u come, have your CCUE card with you for 10? discount! *a membership card you can get discount on for certain chinese restaurants"}
{"text":"* Food is above average and well presented for a AYCE sushi buffet * Place is nicely decorated but can definitely be cleaner. Hallway to washrooms has sticky floors * Above average priced buffet with ipad ordering system * Decent service and can get insane busy at times"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good for an AYCE, by far one of the best ones I've been to in Markham. I've been here for a countless amount of times for dinner. The iPad menu makes it quick and easy to order and over all the restaurant looks clean and modern. The food comes pretty fast, and none of my orders were ever missed."}
{"text":"We had a reservation for 9 at 7:30pm on a Monday and the table was ready the second we walked in! It was a great start to out night. We ordered our food on the iPad and it was a cool experience for the kids at our table. But that went downhill very quickly.   The food is standard or even slightly below standard (i.e. our Japanese style baked mussels were lukewarm and not fresh, our mangoes were raw, fibrous and extremely sour). The food came it extremely slowly, with servers who stacked plates on top of plates, effectively squishing our sushi. Our 30 pieces of salmon sashimi turned out to be 15 pieces which was the equivalent of maybe 6 pieces anywhere else. Wary of them missing our orders, I ordered miso soup 3 times over the course of an hour, and finally, 1.5 hours later, all three of my orders came.   It was a frustrating experience especially because with a table of 9, we cleaned out our food quickly and were left constantly wondering if we ordered enough, if our orders were ignored or missed, and whether or not we should order more.   We will not come back and pay for this frustration and mediocre food."}
{"text":"A great alternative to KAKA Ayce. It is 2-3$ cheaper per person and generally has the same quality food imo. The place is larger and feels less cramped. The only thing they are lacking is those torched sushi which Kaka is known for, which I personally do not mind. However I do think their sushi rolls are delicious, probably better than Kaka. I would definitely come back, lesser wait, cheaper and better service! They have a bigger menu for deserts which is nice :)"}
{"text":"I've been here twice. The first time was quite pleasant, which is why I suggested my friends to come here tonight. But tonight's service was just awful. 10 minutes into us sitting down, waiter comes over and asks if that's all the people we have. We let him know that one more friend was on her way and she'd arrive in about 5 minutes. He proceeded to tell us that the clock was ticking and that there is a seating time limit.   While we're eating, the waiters kept coming to pick up empty dishes, which is great.. But they would interrupt you while you're mid-bite with chopsticks in your mouth, and basically tell you to pass the empty plates to them. And then they'd come back to remind you there's a seating time limit. Next thing I know, they're handing out the bills without us even asking for it. There wasn't anyone waiting for a table but the server was literally shooing us out.   $28.00 for weeknight AYCE is pretty pricey. Service is subpar. Probably wouldn't come back cause there are better AYCE places with better service."}
{"text":"The service was terrible here. From being greeted by the hostess who didn't smile and greeted us like a robot to the server who found it hard to understand why we wanted water, things weren't very good. Before we even sat down, the airy hostess asked us \"Are you having a la carte or buffet\" How about giving us some details on the buffet first (price? what is included?) or even some menus so we can decide. This was just an example of the staff's cluelessness that abounded the entire evening. We ordered a variety of food...the sashimi and tempura were not bad, but everything else wasn't very good. Oh...and you have to order your food using a tablet. Very inconvenient, especially when you want to customize your order a little (less sauce, for eg). We wasted time just trying to figure out how to use the darn tablet thing. Why is it so hard  for the restaurant to have a human being take your order instead of making the customer order through a computer? Why would a customer pay a full tip then if it is not full service compared to other restaurants? And the menus weren't actually menus, but delivery/ take-out pamphlets. Mediocre food and bad service. Will not be coming back here."}
{"text":"This is my favourite sushi restaurant. It's close to my house. My son loves sushi and he loves this place. The order via iPad is convenient and the service is quick. The food is good the price is reasonable for all-you-can-eat. We usually reserve a table so we don't need to wait in the line."}
{"text":"I LOVE SUSHI. Plain and simple. Kiku Japanese restaurant was literally right next to my hotel and I was drawn to it like a moth to a flame.  They provide iPads to select and submit your orders. I ordered the 12 piece sashimi combo which was very fresh and worth the money. They also provide a small salad, bowl of miso soup and white rice with your order.   The atmosphere is fun and the wait staff are friendly and attentive. I will certainly return when I am in the neighborhood again.  Sadly enough, they do not accept American Express :|"}
{"text":"They have ipads to order food. It's pretty fancy. food is decent as well, the chefs seem to be detail oriented to provide good food presentation. Waiters and host are slightly dismissive though during busy hours."}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times. Over 10 times to be exact. You use an iPad to choose your food. You see the food pics on the iPad with a description.  Service is always great. Dishes come quickly and they take away my dirty plates quickly. 5/5  Selection: I noticed that the selection seems less than before...They ran out of green tea ice cream today :/  This isn't the worst selection for a lunch AYCE but not the best. 4/5 I've also had their dinner AYCE as well, the selection is a lot better because you get Sashimi and a few other items. But you are paying $10 more before tax and tip.  Food quality: I think the quality is decent. Obviously there are better places but you have to understand that for AYCE, the quality is usually lower (they are a business and they need to be profitable). 4/5   Cleanliness: It's better than some sushi places plus I never feel sick after eating here. Trust me... I have a really weak stomach. The main reason I eat here because I'm scared to try new places because I get diarrhea and food poisoning quite regularly when I eat out. This place has never made me sick. So 5/5 for cleanliness!   The current price is $17.50 for mon- Thursday lunch AYCE... It's a dollar more for Friday- Sunday lunch. Of course dinner is much more...   If you're hungry and can eat a lot of food, I recommend this place.  Aside: sorry for not taking any pictures... I usually add pics with my review. Next time, I'll take some pics and add it with this review"}
{"text":"The food is really good, especially considering it's AYCE. Food comes pretty fast too. The decor and ambiance and is modern and comfortable. Id come again!"}
{"text":"3.5 It's okay. Nothing special. The iPads are super heavy so be careful.  I like their sweet shrimp. Everything else is just your standard ayce sushi restaurant. Nothing makes them stand out.   For this price, I'd rather go to spoon and fork (plus)"}
{"text":"This used to be my go-to for AYCE sushi, but it has gone downhill over the years.  Service is lower than average, but I go there for the food.  It is all iPad ordering which is nice and I like that I don't need to get a servers attention in order to put my order in.  Food arrives pretty quickly but sometimes the food is not fresh and you can tell they premade it and put it in the fridge until someone orders it.  Sometimes the avocado on the rolls have already started browning.  They recently added a few new items as well as upped the price for AYCE.  They now have torched sushi and a few other items (not very memorable).  There are definitely places that have more variety and better quality items that I would drive a little farther and pay a few more dollars to go to.  On a side note, I have been here one time and saw a cockroach on the floor by my feet and I didn't return until many months later (surprised I even went back)."}
{"text":"Came here on my birthday for lunch.. Wish i hadn't.. The variety sucks! (Very little variety) The sushi didn't even taste like sushi.. tasted like normal rice wrapped with seaweed and some sashimi. The grilled stuff was way too salty and PEPPER ON EVERYTHING!.... Really? Service sucked, took forever to get some waitresses here.. Also, charged us more for accidentally ordering a drink..  I wouldn't come here for AYCE again, nope. I'd  prefer Yang's kitchen over this sucky AYCE.   THATS ALSO OVER PRICED !!!!  Definitely a no no for me ."}
{"text":"I don't usually enjoy myself after eating at all you can eat sushi places.....walk out too full and always feel so bloated after.  But if I isolate to the subset of AYCE sushi restaurants, then I'll say this place does a pretty good job.    Orders are responded to very quickly after submitting it through the tablet.  A lot of items can be ordered on an individual piece basis too.   Size of items are small so it's easier to try more items.  Quality of the tempura was good.  Dessert choices are good.  Sashimi was so-so quality.  Rolls were ok.   Most of the cooked food was pretty good.   Overall good job but.....i just don't like AYCE so I'm probably not coming back lol.....so I will still give 4 stars.  But I'm so bloated right now so maybe I'll finish this review before i remove another star bc of my personal bias!"}
{"text":"This review is for weekend lunch and for vegetarian options.  The decor is very modern and the restaurant is quite large with rows of booths along both walls and tables closely spaced together in the middle.  iPad ordering was easy and fun.  Servers are extremely efficient, bringing orders quickly and removing empty dishes just as fast.  It wasn't hard to flag down staff for more tea or extra pickled ginger.  Vegetarian options included quite a few maki and hand rolls, vegetable teriyaki, pan fried mushrooms, grilled eggplant, seaweed and tofu salad.  This was a better selection than I have had at other AYCE Japanese restaurants.  I was also impressed by the dessert selection which included, tiramisu, creme brulee, mango pudding, coconut and ginger \"milk\", as well as the usual ice cream flavours.  Washrooms could be improved.  It was clean, but very dark and the stalls were cramped."}
{"text":"One of my favourite sushi takeout joints! Depending on where I'm coming from, I usually phone my order in to the Markham or North York location ahead of time so it's ready by the time I get there.  I always get the 14-piece Crystal Sushi combo, which also comes with miso soup and a salad. At $10.99, I think the quality and variety just can't be beat! It comes with red tuna, salmon, snapper, surf clam, shrimp, octopus, cuttlefish, 6 pieces of california maki plus one salmon hand roll.  I'm not a huge fan of shrimp, and they've always exchanged it for salmon instead at no cost whenever I remember to request it. I've also started requesting that they substitute the cali roll for a salmon/avocado roll, which I am always happy to pay an extra $1 for.   It's been awhile since I've been here for AYCE at either location, but I've never had any complaints.   I admit I've tried other takeout sushi, but for the value, variety and quality, I've yet to find a preferred takeout sushi place!"}
{"text":"Everything was served so fast unlike other all u can eat sushi places. Sashimi was fresh and unlimited sweet shrimp:) I also really like their teppanyaki shrimp. Came on a Sunday for dinner. Way better than KAKA."}
{"text":"Haven't came here for so long. Worst experience ever! Came here on Valentine's day, good thing I made a reservation. IPad ordering system, which is very convenient. We order a dynamite roll and realized that the inner part of the tempura shrimp is still translucent (which mean is raw). We quickly asked the manager to come and he quickly explained that all dynamite roll comes like that and it is cooked. I couldn't understand a word he said since it was so loud and he was rushing it. Other foods aren't that great too and it's $27.99 weekday dinner / $29.99 weekend dinner. Doesn't make sense that it's only $2 difference but weekend has more selection. I had diarrhea after the dinner and I'm sure this was the cause of it. Never coming back again."}
{"text":"Regular All-You-Can-Eat Japanese restaurant with a few good thing.  Ordering, each table has their own iPad as menu and ordering system. You select the items you want, and ask for a server to come by to help you to actually place the order. Could be better if the customer can do that themselves? I don't know, may be they tried that and not working? (People sending in crazy orders?)  It's good system as you can keep track of how many items you ordered and you can tell what's been severed. It would probably lead to less \"overeating\" as you can see you had ordered 40 pieces of sashimi already, it's probably enough for one night.  Food comes to you really fast, and we got everything we ordered in matter of minutes, and \"we got everything we ordered\", that's a really big plus for AYCE places.  It slightly higher in price, and some of the item had problems, like the dishes aren't clean, steaks were too tough to eat, tempura shrimp had 70% of batter and the sticker on the slice of lemon that serve with the fish didn't got peeled off.  Things are okay, and they have some special sitting area, one is a \"room\" for like 10 people (a section with a glass wall..), another one is a Japanese style that you sit on the floor.  A 3 stars overall, could do better"}
{"text":"I'm going to be completely honest when I say I didn't even know this place existed! I have been to this plaza so many times, but always drove around the parking lot in one direction, so somehow always missed this side.   A huge space disguised by the entrance in the corner. The decor is quite simple but the restaurant was a bit dim for the space they have. The booths were quite large and comfy though.   The food overall was quite good. A good amount of variety in their AYCE options, and they even had some items you wouldn't see elsewhere. Definitely happy to see some Eel Sushi! My friends were delighted that they had Deep Fried Banana too! Best of all, this was just the lunch menu, which means they have more to come during dinner.   Glad to see there is another option for AYCE Japanese right around the corner. Will definitely come back sometime for dinner!"}
{"text":"I used to like this restaurant. Now the service is very bad-for example, the waitress came to our group after 35 minutes since we sat down at the table and said:you know that you have a time limit here. We had to ask for tea and a spoon for soup 5 times for like 15 minutes.  Food was not as good as before-sashimi was small and not fresh. Gyoza were very bad, after I opened it it smelled like old and bad meat.  Service is bad, food is bad, the place went downhill. So disappointed."}
{"text":"I loved the elegant decor of Kiku and enjoyed my first experience using an iPad ordering system, which was wonderful given I am relatively new to the sushi world and have yet to become familiar with all the terms ('futomaki', 'teppanyaki', 'hibachi', etc.) - to this end, the pictures on the iPads really helped! I've also heard that some iPad-equipped AYCEs won't accept an order without server approval, but Kiku certainly isn't one of them. If you have trouble you can use the 'Call Server' button, but I warn you that it may take a while for a response, at least in my experience at this restaurant, which was bustling with patrons even amid the lunch hours of a Monday.   With that said, this is a very pricey place for AYCE ($15.50 for lunch! Oh, Richmond Hill...) for sushi that did not seem to be of superior quality to other joints in DT/GTA (New Generation on Bloor, Kiyo on Yonge/Elgin Mills, etc.).   My table ordered 23 menu items (needless to say we were hungry) and the standouts were the Las Vegas Roll, the breaded shrimp, yam tempura roll and the spicy salmon hand roll. Not a bad experience by any means but also not outstanding."}
{"text":"So I came here for the first time with my 2 girlfriends and was pretty impressed   The restaurant was nicely built with plenty of booths on either side of the restaurant along with ample of seating space in the centre.  It was a Thursday evening and surprisingly wasnt busy.  There was a nice cool breeze inside as through their ventilation system was top notch.  The decor was especially pleasant with beads of raindrop designs coming down from the ceiling.  The staff was friendly however I don't think they speak English very well which was fine.  The selection wasn't so bad considering I'm a vegan so I was happy with all their vegetable sushi and hot dishes and sides selections.  We ordered off an ipad tablet and let me tell you their service was lightening fast (not kidding) and the quality was fantastic!!  I'm not sure how I managed to squeeze in 5 orders of their desserts afterwards which included red bean icecream, tiramisu, and their mango yogurt which was so yummy.  It was worth it!  I totally reccomend this location for fast and fresh AYCE sushi and in a nice setting.  It's in the same plaza as Baton Rouge.  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I'm definitely a fan of this place. By no means is it as good as it gets, but as far as AYCE Japanese goes, it has got its act together.  You can obviously find your good old varieties of sushi, sashimi, temaki, etc., but they've also got some variety that I really enjoyed. Namely, the deep fried sushi... God bless. The service should be given a thumbs up too! At a lot of sushi places, timely (and accurate) orders are far from expected, but with Kiku's order-on-tablet system, you order, have a short chat, and enjoy.  My one annoyance; for some reason their isle chairs have extremely short backs. Once you're done with an evening of Japanese cuisine, something to rest your back on would be appreciated."}
{"text":"This place isn't spectacular now that there are so many more options. They keep the stuff here pretty well done but the options there aren't anything special. The service is pretty good but for the long lines they have here all the time I would say it isn't really worth it."}
{"text":"This place is like the Spring Sushi in downtown toronto. It has the exact same menu, which is on an iPad. The sushi rolls are VERY tiny, and everything is just eh, nothing special. The menu is also really limited.... Lunch AYCE was around $14. Was it worth it? I dont think so."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi!! It literally came out in minutes when I ordered off their very advanced iPad ordering system. And let me tell you about the variety, they had so much! It hit every craving I had."}
{"text":"they say first impressions count and make a difference? here's my first impression of Kiku   this place was recommended by a colleague of mine, but when my mom and i went, we were waiting for what seemed like FOREVER because they were seating those who either had a larger party or had reservations! we were told \"oh it'll only be 15-20 mins\"....YEAH RIGHT..in an all you can eat place with no time limit? what a JOKE!  this place is better suited to groups. not recommended if it's a party of 2-3.  my mom and i were totally fed up by 7:30 (we had already been waiting a good 30-25 mins and we certainly weren't gonna wait much longer there!)  and took off for Ichiban at leslie and 16 where we know we get our food in a really timely manner."}
{"text":"Everything is very fresh. Come early like 10ish or else reserved a table before 12pm or else you will have to line up. Price is very reasonable  $10 per kid at lunch time and about $15 per adult...drinks are extra and tea is free.  I did come at dinner once and the price is higher like every other ayce  place... but unlike other place the food option is the same as lunch time that's the only bummer. The service is like every Asian restaurant out there \" u order and they place food on ur table and leave\". I really find nothing wrong with that. As long as the server don't yell,spit, slam etc...."}
{"text":"Kiku is one of my favourite options when it comes to AYCE Japanese restaurants. I love sashimi, and I find that Kiku has one of the better selection of sashimi on their AYCE dinner menu. What makes Kiku stand out for me is that they've got sweet shrimp!! The quality of their sashimi is pretty standard for an AYCE restaurant. They also have a very large variety of sushi and cooked food. Try their Las Vegas roll and baked mussels, it's awesome! Last but not least, Kiku also has a great dessert selection! I love mango, and they've got all kinds of mango dessert...mango mousse, mango pudding, mango yogurt, mango ice cream! I also love the deep fried milk. Overall, I like Kiku because I find that they have a lot of unique items that other AYCE restaurants don't offer.  All ordering is done through their iPad system. I find that service is generally pretty good. The food gets delivered quickly, and they also clear the empty plates off the table quickly. Whenever I need service, someone usually comes by pretty quickly, unlike some other AYCE places. The restaurant is pretty big, but they do get pretty busy on weekends, so make sure to call ahead and make a reservation!"}
{"text":"My party of 7 arrived at around 6pm on a Thursday evening. As your typical university students, we were starving and immediately loaded the iPad system with our mountain of orders. Everything came very quickly and in the specified portions which was pleasing because most places leave dishes out or serve you the wrong thing.  The food was alright. The sashimi wasn't exceptionally fresh and were sliced quite thinly. Regardless, still good. The cooked food was yummy also. Salmon belly was nicely grilled and and beef ribs were tender.  The one thing that really put me off though was the service of one of the waitresses. Not even all of them. Just one. As she was serving us a dish of saucy deep fried scallops, she dropped one on the table/chair which rolled and hit me, and she neither apologized nor cleaned up the mess. She just walked away and left the scallop on the floor.."}
{"text":"They say closing at 10:30...they did last call at 9:45 and started cleanibg w bleach smell and the waiter came w machine even thought we werent done!..."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick sushi dinner option near Hwy 7 and 404. Didn't realize it was an AYCE option, but still only wanted a few rolls.   I ordered the spicy salmon roll and a futomaki (spinach, crab meat, and preserved vegetable) roll.   The rolls were okay but left a bit to be desired on the freshness side. Seemed the raw stuff wasn't too fresh.  Still good value especially if you are doing AYCE, so it is an option if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Great service great sushi! $25 for all you can eat Japanese food. Order on an iPad get your food in a couple of minutes."}
{"text":"I give this place a 3.5/5. I would say that this is one of the better ayce sushi restaurants in the Markham/ Richmond Hill area. I would advise you all to make a reservation if you plan on eating there during busy dinner hours, especially on the weekend. I was unaware one time and ended up waiting 45 minutes for a table (friends and I were pretty persistent on eating ayce).   Anyway, the food they serve is pretty good for ayce, but sometimes their cooked foods' quality is inconsistent. The service is standard and food comes pretty quick, the waitresses come around fairly often to clear our dishes and tend to our needs whenever we call for a server on the ipad.   The ipad system is smart on their part and I think it would be pretty awesome if other ayce sushi restaurants catch on with this concept. It makes mass ordering for a large group much easier.   This is one of my frequent go-to ayce sushi buffets, so I'm guaranteed to visit again. I also recommend this place to anyone who's interested in binge eating sashimi and sushi."}
{"text":"Let's start off with the first thing that stands out.  The iPad ordering. It's fantastic, efficient, and really almost no room for errors in ordering. It's a great service that lets other servers use their time to clean up tables or get more tea. Not only that, but they serve food so much quicker. There isn't any extra orders from other tables, or any of those problems in this restaurant.  However, the desert quality was a little concerning. The sashimi's were okay. The maki rolls were also pretty good. They have a such a large variety. But when it came down to the ramens and udon. I'd honestly only give them about a 4/10. The noodles were wimpy things with no real texture and the vegetables were like the frozen vegetable thrown into the food. The beef was awful. AWFUL. They were dried up and hard to chew. Definitely completely disappointed with the teriyaki steak and the garlic bit sized beef. Onto the dessert, I was completely done with this restaurant. Their tiramisu was like hardened cheesecake with bulk barn coco powder sprinkled over it. Their mango puddings/jellos tasted weird, not to mention the mango was extremely hard to bite. The ice cream was standard. But the desserts, better off share one then to all order one to try. Overall, the meal started great and ended off poorly."}
{"text":"Heard that you get to eat for free on your bday, so we made a reservation for 4 and specifically told them we had a bday. After we ate, they said we needed 5 people for a free bday meal. Very disappointed that they withheld that info on purpose and shows that's how they run their business..."}
{"text":"I really appreciated how they didn't add a 15% mandatory service charge to our bill (like most restaurants do) even though we had more than 20 people in our party. That really makes a big difference in the bill!  I would say that if you have a big celebration, a large party of people who like to eat and socialize, and enjoy eating sushi, Sushi Kiku Japanese Cuisine is a really good place to consider! It was $27.99 for a weekend dinner price for an adult which I thought was really reasonable. Also, they provide free wifi in the restaurant!:) (The Congee Queen next door is a pokestop. )"}
{"text":"A die-hard sushi lover. I was recommended here and my first experience was quite nice.  I came here on a weekday afternoon, and waiting to be seated took only 5-10 minutes. Maybe even less. First time being given an iPad to order and I found it very easy to use with all of the pictures and the fast ordering process. The restaurant had an overall modern vibe, one of the nicer AYCE places I have visited.   The food was great, sushi was very fresh - I have no complaints whatsoever regarding the food because it exceeded my expectations in taste.  One problem I did have with this restaurant was that the food came incredibly slow. As I said before, ordering took probably less than 5 minutes - but my friends and I waited about half an hour before anything came. And the worst part was that we ordered approximately 24 dishes initially and they only served us 4 or 5 dishes. We called a waitress to ask what was going on and she completely ignored us and walked away. Then we called the manager to ask what had happened to the rest of our order and he came back and told us that our order had been \"lost\" and that we needed to re-order. Not sure if this is the typical AYCE tactic to make their customers wait and lose their appetite, but if it was, their strategy worked. This happened not once, but twice. They claimed that it may be a fault in their iPads, but I'm still very wary about this.  Another minor problem I had was that their soft drinks were not included in the AYCE lunch. Would have been nice to be able to order soft drinks with no extra charge, but I'm not complaining too much.  I'll give this place 4 stars for being one of the best AYCE sushi restaurants in the Markham/Richmond Hill area in terms of food quality, presentation and decor; taking the last star away for the poor service."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming to this location since it has opened 3 weeks go and so far we have been treated well by the staff. The sashimi is very fresh and tender. The kitchen food could be a little lighter on the salt. My fav dish is the coconut shrimp. Its deep friend shrimp coated with mayo. So good! Garlic beef is good but in my opinion needs more acrylic and less salt. Must try the sirloin steak!  Miso soup has just enough salt and it is served HOT, which seems to be an issue at other places we have been to. Maki rolls are small,less rice but stuffed just enough. Have a lot of variety for maki rolls. If you're looking for specific sashimi, the only thing is they have octopus sashimi. Everything else is the same. Dessert is good. Should try the mango yogurt and the coconut milk pudding.Drinks are not included and I think are around $2.00 but comes with refills.  Lately they have been busy so I suggest reservation, especially if you prefer the booths for some privacy."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today, with my 3 kids. We arrived at 12.40pm and had to wait around 5 mins, while they reset a table for us. The place was all full up but luckily some early birds were starting to leave. As soon as we sat down, the kids wasted no time ordering on the ipad. Everything that we ordered was quite delicious. We don't eat fish sushi, so we can't comment on that. All the items were quite small, so you could try lots of dishes. Sushi rice wasn't the best quality, it kept breaking up, but was ok for AYCE. Everything that we ordered came except for the grilled chicken wings. I asked a waitress about them but she didn't speak 1 word of English, only mandarin. She looked at me blankly and called a manager over. He put in my order again, and came back to ask if they came this time.  Overall, it's a nice place to dine. Waitresses are miserable and don't speak any English. Would return again, if I wanted to eat this type of food again."}
{"text":"Yet another AYCE sushi restaurant but with a fancy, spacey decor. You order by tablet. They have an ok selection of veggie rolls. Avocado was fresh and better quality than what I usually get. Slightly pricier than most AYCE sushi restaurants but you get what you paid for. Complimentary tea, but extra charge on other drinks. Overall I like this restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here for AYCE dinner... was extremely disappointed to find out my four year old child costs me $14.  So that is the price for a kindergarten child!  Ridiculous!  My 20 month old costs me another $6.  Meanwhile, most other ayce don't charge for the 20 month old and around $6 for thr kindergartener.  They offered me the option of a la carte but i had already told my older child we would be having sushi, icecream etc...    As for the food and service, really mediocre for the price they are charging.. even for adults.  Their sashimi slices are half the regular size.  Their shrimp sashimi is also not very clean.  Husband got the runs several times that evening after dining here that evening, and between him and I, shrimp sashimi was the only thing i didn't eat.  I would also expect for that price, that they would offer more variety of sashimi pieces, e.g. scallop sashimi or ika sushi, but not so!  This dinner costed us almost double that of other ayce places, yet the satisfaction was simply not there!    They reminded us of the 2hr limit several times when there were plenty other tables of our table size available, and no one waiting either... wow for service!    Will not be recommending this place, nor will we intentionally come back to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"If you're not looking to spend $35+ at Kaka, maybe come try Kiku and see if you like it. Obviously not as good as the aforementioned, but a lot of items are hit or miss. Patrons use ipads to order everything. If you have a question you can flag down a waiter/waitress but the attitute you receive is also hit or miss (LOL).   The actual good items of note: beef short ribs, las vegas roll (best roll at this restaurant imo), shrimp tempura, beef tataki, grilled shrimp, salmon rose, spicy salmon maki  Honestly, outside of those items being good the other stuff on the menu is average or straight up bad. Chicken teriyaki \"dryer than Gandhi's flipflop\" *gordon ramsay voice*. Spoiled beef used in the teppanyaki steak.  Most of the rolls are average. The black dragon or bbq eel one is not bad (maybe above average).  Still one of the only AYCE sushi joints in richmond hill that isn't outright atrocious, so I do come here from time to time when I'm famished."}
{"text":"Worst customer service I've ever dealt with. Waited to sit for about 20 min, there was a line of over 15 people waiting with many empty tables but the only people that were being seated were reservations. Everytime I asked about the line up I was told to wait another 5 min, but waited for about 20 min in total before we sat down. Once seated we ordered out food and it many of the items were missed. Too pricey for this kind of service"}
{"text":"I have been to a lot of sushi restaurants and this is only Ok compared to a lot of others All YOU can Eat.  Came on the Saturday dinner whih wasn't too bad of a wait if you got there before 6:30 pm.  We had no complaints about the quality of sushi rolls being served or the taste or service as previous complaints have been made from other reviewers.  The only thing is the sashimi slices were a bit thin but it's no big deal to order more since it is... ALL YOU CAN EAT afterall- so don't know why people are complaining. I understand they are just making sure food is not wasted.  Only complaint was for dessert they were sold out of 4 different ice creams and mouse cakes... So really there wasn't much dessert offered in the end.. Which is disappointing for a busy Saturday night running out of product by 8 pm.  Pricey for a Saturday night dinner though compared to other sushi restaurants also considering they did not have all types of sushi available to order. $27 a person.  Decor is nice. Washrooms are dirty. And walking asiles were very tight because they just kept adding tables and chairs attaching to the booths to accommodate more people when really they don't have the space, and this made it hard to walk the aisle when trying to get to washroom and servers walking back and forth.  Probably won't visit again beause it is standard and we can find same quality with a slightly cheaper price elsewhere. Nothing spectacular about this sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"Food was up and down, but the vibe was cool - AYCE with an iPad, so we ordered and tried stuff in small quantities.  Overall a fun dinner."}
{"text":"This is probably the most frequently visited AYCE spot for me in my area. It's not the most expensive and the quality is really good. The interior is nice enough and bathrooms have been pretty clean everytime I've been.   The service is very quick, within minutes of sending your order through the tablet, something will hit your table.   There have been a few instances where certain items never show up. Some of the actual servers will drop or aggressively slide plates at you which I think is really rude.   For the quality and price point. This is my go to.   ProTip: sashimi slices are thin and small, order in high volume! The mango desserts are a delight, try them all!"}
{"text":"Stopped by Kiku on a Sunday afternoon because their lunch ends at 3:30 pm which is the latest in comparison to other AYCE sushi places in the area.   Food was subpar. Although sashimi wasn't served, I could tell from my nigiri, red dragon roll and salmon rose that the fish wasn't of the greatest quality and not very fresh. The only memorable item I could recall was the beef sukiyaki soup which was surprisingly very good. Spicy salmon roll, salmon & avocado hand roll, salmon steak and belly, yam tempura roll and the seaweed salad weren't bad either.   Based on what we ordered, the items I would recommend to stay away from would be the sliced beef enoki mushroom (beef was way too tough), red dragon roll (shrimp tempura was soggy, had no crunch) udon and the BBQ eel pancake (eel is barely existent and just so not worth the calories).   Everything else I tried was passable.  Ordering off the ipad is easy and convenient. There were no mix-ups or missing items and food came out at a good pace. We were starving so I'm glad we didn't really have to wait or ever wonder when our food was coming. Staff was really nice and efficient as they constantly came by to clear our plates. Thinking back, I was very satisfied with the service.    2 stars for food and an extra star for service.  Overall conclusion is I probably wouldn't bother to come back. Not because my experience was terrible but because there are much better options around. $16.50 per person is pretty standard nowadays but not cheap by any means so it's only natural to be selective."}
{"text":"What can I say , love this place... Right when I walked in the atmosphere was nice, a bit loud but let me tell you there was soo soo much choices for food. Unlike other Japanese  restaurant were selection is ok, this place had everything you name it.. Only bad thing was that the deserts weren't all that.. The service is great food came right on time, server was nice and happy .. And amazing thing is that we ordered the food through an IPAD.. Yes that's right ... I recommend coming her with a large crowd worth the money, little pricey yet you get what you pay for.. Final result great place recommend it to anyone who enjoys sushi and all you can eat verities :) ++ thumps up~"}
{"text":"I've been to Kiku many times in the pass, especially this location, because the food and service was a lot better then the other store, and was above average to a lot of buffets in the area. However i have to say after a long time not going. this place has gone seriously downhill.   First of all, the sushi portion. the sushi itself has maintained a standard which is why it has two stars still. It is still decent and within average of most ayce sushi places in markham/richmond hill.The salmon rose has a very good portion in terms of the salmon and rice. And also the Eel sushi is very good, since the portion of eel is very good, and taste is excellent.   Outside of these parts. here is where kiku has lost all its stars. Its cooked food has seriously gone from pretty good, to terrible. The tempura was burnt and overcooked. which is amazing considering there really isn't that many sushi places that can burn tempura considering it is a deep fried deep fryer dish.   all of the dishes we ordered were overcooked or burnt. the beef sirloin was like gum texture, you can't bite through. this was previously one of their highlights as they did sirloin correctly. The short ribs were burnt and overcooked. the chicken was so overcooked you literally can feel how dry it is inside. The pacfic saury was burnt to a crisp. as you can see the theme here is, you can't taste the food cause it was all overcooked or burnt. Its just inedible. which is amazing considering the chef used to be very good, so i don't know if they changed chef, becuase he managed to make all 10 different cooked dishes we ordered overcooked and burn, it really takes some talent to be bad at all dishes.   The eel pancake was inexcusable, it was made with onion inside. it seems they don't understand the basic concept of how a japanese eel pancake is supposed to be made. there was no eel. lots of onions, and teriyaki sauce.   Even the ice cream had changed suppliers. you can tell, as their mango ice cream is wrong, it is not japanese flavour, they probably switched to a cheaper brand.   I have been so throughly disappointed at this experience, that if the sushi wasn't decent, they would've dropped to 1 star. And this was a restuarant i had previously would have given 4/5 stars.   Overall unless they return things back to normal. i would say avoid it like the plague. it is just not good, period."}
{"text":"So I gave it a tried and the food is very good for AYCE Japanese food. The service was good and quick. The food was very fast too. If you haven't been here then you should try it."}
{"text":"This is another pretty generic AYCE iPad-ordering sushi place.  I decided to check this place out when I found out Sushi on 7 had changed hands (for the worse).  It's a fairly clean place with lots of seating available.  I went on a Tuesday evening at 8pm without a reservation and got seated right away.  First, the food: everything is pretty average and a little bit off.  There just isn't anything memorable about the meal.  The chawanmushi was a bit overcooked.  The cubed steak was tough to chew.  The enoki beef rolls and green onion beef rolls were both a little bit weird tasting.  The coconut milk dessert tasted like there were remnants of soap in it and the ice cream had chunks of ice in it.  The sashimi was OK and they do have sweet shrimp on the menu.  The maki rolls were decent as well.  On a positive note, the food came out FAST and they weren't stingy with multiple orders.  The restaurant is also debit or cash only.  Overall, I probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"I have been here many times, the service over the last year has become horrible, the cleanliness of the restaurant and dishes, needs serious attention. And the wait times for food and forgotten food is to long.  We were a party of 2 today ordered 14 items and we were there for 2 hours .  My experience is this has become the norm. So sad."}
{"text":"This place went downhill.  Food was sub par and quality was just not there.  Service does not exist.  It appears the employees were working in a slave camp.  It doesn't appear they can speak at all (English or Chinese).  They are also champions at throwing the plates of food on the table.  If the plates were made of glass, it would break lol.  Go to kaka at first markham place instead."}
{"text":"Really good sushi with reasonable price, variety of foods to choose from! Service was alright, needed to ask 2 different waiters for water. Other than that, wonderful ayce suggestion!"}
{"text":"I came for lunch and ate for $20 each adult. I wouldn't recommend coming here even though this restaurants is cheaper than most sushi restaurants the food is not worth the amount. It's always a hit & miss,the waiters are unexperienced and rude. This one waiter we had, didn't quite catch her name. As she came to our table we asked her which drinks were included and she flat out ignored us and walked away. The rest of the staff also came off as unwelcoming."}
{"text":"Went with coworker for Friday lunch. The food came fast.   I really love the spicy salmon sushi.   However the waitresses gave us some attitude because we went as a large group. And we ordered a lot of sushi and other stuff which cause them keep serving us.   But I mean you as a restaurant shouldn't you always expect large group come?   I would recommend to you just go with 2 -3 people. I think that's the number of people they can handle per table."}
{"text":"I'm very disappointed with Kiku, very poor service & quality of food!   Sashimi was sliced as thin as a piece of paper!  The servers were COLD & poor attitude.  We press the 'call server' button on the iPad for our bill.  Several servers walked by, saw the message on our iPad & walked away.  After 10 min, we finally waved at someone & she came over.  Apparently she was our server.  She said the APP doesn't have any alert to them that we have called our server.  We'll never come again!"}
{"text":"LOL, no idea why I ended up here - vegans and AYCE sushi is either a waste of time, a waste of money or often, both. I brought my sis here to eat for lunch, which was $15 - which isn't too bad for an average sushi buffet. We accidentally ordered mango juice for $3 each, because we thought it was free with the pop.. waste, because it was sweeter than my personality will ever be.   They had a bunch of vegetarian options, but not enough to make AYCE worth it. The avocado was very ripe, exactly the way I liked it. The tofu tempura was not bad as well. Vegetarian udon was MSG soup with one broccoli and a carrot. The mango/cucumber handroll was tasteless - why was the mango not sweet at all? Merp. I didn't find anything in particular that I really enjoyed, but nothing was gross.   As you've probably read, kiku uses ipad ordering, which is efficient and there were minimal mistakes made, only one tofu tempura that was left forgotten. Service was the typical asian service - I think they use ipad ordering to avoid human contact. I had stacked my plate of tofu tempura and veggie spring roll on top of a plate we had already used, and the server ripped out the plate from under the one I was eating on, without saying a word.. which was a bit rude and kind of scary.   I don't think I'd return to kiku, even though the ambience is very pretty. It reminds me of the vampire theme in sims 3 LOL."}
{"text":"Calling all sushi and AYCE folks- counting calories is not in the cards when you attend. We came out some time ago and were met with iPads which were easy to follow. Be careful when ordering as a single order, for example of short ribs, actually come out as 1 or 2 piece so you might as well double up on the order. The food appears made to order for the most part, with reasonably good value for the money. Just try to fill up on the beef and sushi to recover the amount paid. You have to save room for the bananas and red been ice cream. Mix those two together in your serving bowl for a nice end of meal treat."}
{"text":"this was an okay place for AYCE.  Using the ipad to order was pretty smooth and easy.  And the decor is relatively modern for a Japanese sushi place.  However, I got sick WHILE eating here, so i don't know if the quality/freshness of the food is all that good.."}
{"text":"If you like AYCE sushi, the restaurant choices get pretty competitive.  I have been to a fair number of AYCE joints, especially when I can tell they make it fresh and don't try to \"carb load\" you with tissue thin fish on top of mitts full of rice.  For a late afternoon lunch, I decided to order off of the standard menu instead of AYCE (too close to dinner).  I ordered the standard sushi combination for maybe a buck or two less than AYCE.  The fish was fairly fresh, but not outstanding, and not superior to other places nearby.  However, it was warm, and that is just a complete turn-off for sushi.  This used to be a Chinese restaurant with tons of amazing dishes, and I ate here at least once a week.  As a sushi restaurant, I would not have a problem if someone dragged me here, but if I am \"deciding\" on where to go, there are other places a 10 minute walk away, and even better if you're driving (try Dragon Legend off Woodbine).  Maybe I've just become a sushi snob...."}
{"text":"Great place for ayce. They were pretty busy on a Saturday night but my husband and I just decided to grab ayce dinner at the very last min. We only waiting a couple of minutes for a seat. The rice on the sushi was kinda moist tonight. Our table was spacious for a 2 person. There were many variety of food on the menu to choose from. Nothing really special that pops out from the menu. My fav dish would be their shrimp tempura and baked mussel with cheese. The only reason why I did not give this place a 5 star is because :Our order came quickly but then stopped half way. We had no idea if they forgot the rest of our order or not."}
{"text":"Food is nasty, i have never had any sushi that is this bad, horrible!!! It is not fresh at all, would never come back here ever again"}
{"text":"For $35 after tax you could probably find somewhere better, but since this place isn't great it's usually not full so at least you won't have to wait.   Sashimi was alright, can't say much about anything else. I'd stay away from the mango ice cream and mango \"mouse\", which is essentially a glorified piece of whipped cream drizzled with mango sauce."}
{"text":"???????????????all you can eat??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????ipad?????????ok????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Read as 2.5  Came here many times with friends and family, also before they changed names too.  The decor itself is pretty cool, although it can cause a mess sometimes, if the strands get tangled or things like.  The ordering is done on an iPad which makes the process more efficient, but flagging down a waitress is still necessary throughout the meal, and also extremely difficult to do.  There aren't that many of them, and with the tall chairs on the side, its very hard for them to see you at all.  Food-wise, the quality is decent - portion sizes are tiny as expected, but the actual food is okay.  Their plates/bowls of noodles can be eaten up in 3 bites usually.  This is really good for people who just want a taste of everything, but if you like soup noodles specifically, you'd have to order a few bowls of those to get your share.  Their desserts are also tiny.  The puddings are in shot glasses and their spoons don't even always extend to the bottom of the glasses, which makes me wonder how well they're cleaned.....  Overall, a decent AYCE place, but there are better options nearby for the same price and quality of food."}
{"text":"First time here, with a few friends, the pricing is on the slightly more economical side, i think approximately $26 per person. iPad ordering. Quick service and food delivered. It was overall an A-Ok experience with some minor improvements.  The yeah(s):  - pricing - thin slices of sashimi - speed of lightening service for food - variety of foods  The nah(s):  - 1.5 hours dinner time....just order and gobble down your food without chewing...(minus 1 star) - the subpar freshness of the sashimi...it was thin but subpar freshness (minus 0.5 star) - the kicking us out/ last call at 9:00pm (not cool - minus 0.5 stars)  This was a Tuesday evening dinner, with maybe 1/2 restaurant full of people, we were in a booth. I like the fact that the booths are comfy and spacious, iPad ordering and the food came extremely fast. I was kinda shocked, on how fast it was..We ordered sake which was reasonably priced, usually alcohol is expensive but here it was pretty decent pricing. We ate sooo much that it stuffed us up. Considering the fact, that we were ordering like 5 bottles of sake and 2 pitchers of beer, I was really expecting better service. Cuz alcohol itself cost us at least $100. Alcohol is usually the most money making thing ever..cuz they double to triple the price..so I was a bit upset when they were asking us to leave...the last call was at 9:00pm...and they literally wanted to stop us from ordering more alcohol...that's another \"Wow..really?!\"...we have the money to pay for it and we have a high tolerance level so I didn't really get why they were like that to us..  Our bill did come up to a nice $250 with all the alcohol for only 4 people...I mean I appreciate the fact they were probably concerned with our well being in terms of alcohol consumption but we had a designated driver (my friends gf didn't drink)...  All in all, a place I would come back but not in a hurry if they want to kick us out so quickly."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Went here for my first dinner all you can eat sushi. Although the price was a bit expensive (~$35 after tax and tip), the service was incredible! They (thankfully) didn't charge us for extra food, and our group had quite a bit of extra remaining. As well, they didn't add a gratuity for a large group (15+), which most restaurants typically do.  The decor was classy and elegant, which really set a nice ambience for our dinner experience. The food was fresh and they have a huge variety of sushi, sashimi, hand rolls, noodles, rice, and desserts.  Overall, this place was great for our large group. I'd come back, but probably just for lunch which is about $10 cheaper."}
{"text":"Its the same setting as the previous Japanese restaurant. In the middle of this very big restaurant is a beautiful decorative spacer.  We had a group of 10 and didn't wait long to get a seat. Keep in mind we got here by 6. The waitress showed us how to use the iPad service and I found it quite easy to use. The waitress had a really cute uniform that goes on top of her white blouse and black pants. I found it kind of degrading as it looked like a maids uniform.   We ordered almost every type of food they had in stock and I found that the quality of food was not good at all. The food came out really quickly so if you are really hungry then you should definitely give this place a try. If you're looking for good quality ayce Japanese food, I would not recommend coming here at all as it would not satisfy your needs.   Note: the desserts just meets edible standards. (Sorry to be harsh, but I only speak from my perspective and what I had that day). I ordered all of the desserts available and none of them made me feel like I want another one.   In my honest opinion, I wouldn't recommend coming here for food. If you want an experience for the iPad then for sure I would recommend trying it."}
{"text":"Tasted very authentic, but was a little bland for my taste. Japanese food in general tends to be a little too mild for my taste, but I enjoyed this nonetheless. The table service/ordering was brilliant, using an iPad type device per table with pictures of the food on it. Click on the food, and it shows up at the table. My inner geek was thrilled. All you can eat lunch for $14.50/head rounds out the experience with a great value."}
{"text":"Atomsphere: modern, clean, pretty, uses iPads!  Food: 3/5, ayce quality, they have beef sashimi, they offer a good variety of soups, grills items, rolls, sashimi, and desserts, no dishes REALLY stood out Price : 24.99 for weekends  Overall: probably will be back, despite how it's a tad expensive, they have good service."}
{"text":"Best sushi flavor For the price I've ever had delicious!  OK it is a limited menu but everything tastes amazing my favorite was the salmon roses.  The whitefish tuna and the eel was mad so well and the hand rolls weren't stuffed full of rice to make you full.  Everything I had was above average.  And the price is crazy under $14 CAN this place could easily be $30 US in California.  The place was amazing I just wish we had one by us."}
{"text":"I came here with three of my girlfriends on Friday. The place was packed with people. It's recommended that you make a reservation, which we did. We were 15 minutes late and called to ask them to hold our table, which they did. We were seated within minutes of arrival.  The three of us opted to order a la carte because we weren't really hungry to do all you can eat. Each table had an ipad where you can order with, which I found pretty efficient. You can use the ipad to call for service as well. I ordered a sushi set and my friends ordered a bento box each. The portion of food massive!!! We each had take aways because we couldn't finish everything! The food was not bad quality for a restaurant that primarily focuses on AYCE. They gave large thick pieces of sashimi. However, they did skim on the eel (only a little bit of eel with a large portion of avocado). Overall, this restaurant has a lot of potential. The prices for a la carte is quite reasonable for the portion size. The AYCE is a bit pricer than other AYCE (about $1-2 more) that I have been too, but I would definitely come back for AYCE to see what the menu selection is like.  I noticed that they had a small area in the back for traditional japanese seating, which is pretty cool."}
{"text":"It is a standard AYCE sushi place, and the service is ok. They are no friendly, but they are quick with the food. They have the iPad ordering and it is very convenient.   I have been here several times, but the last time I was here I did not enjoy much. The choices were very scarce and portion sizes were small (but it is sometimes a good thing). There were only 2-3 vegetarian options and some of the rolls did not taste very fresh."}
{"text":"Very speedy AYCE sushi buffet.  Ordered wroth iPad and all food arrived within the next 5 min. However the quality of food is not as good as the other ones that I've tried like Matsuda. The skewers are not good,  the mango yogurt isn't good at all as well as the ginger milk...I would not come back here"}
{"text":"We end up coming o kiku after getting kicked out from kaka. Love this sushi place it is nice and well organized. They have tablet for ordering and the food taste great. It's not the best all u can eat sushi but it's pretty good I will definetly recommend this place. They have good rips and definetly get the plan fried mushrooms with butter they are amazing. The design is amazing with great to look at."}
{"text":"this place gets worse every time i come here. but my most recent visit will for sure be the last one. my family and i are sushi enthusiasts, we go out for sushi almost once every week, so over time we learned what fresh sushi is and what is not. a couple of days at kiku we ordered our regulars including sashimi. it was horrible, so we didn't eat it. they wanted to charge us extra for it and when we explained that it is not fresh and almost not edible, the server rolled her eyes at us and gave us attitude with her response.  all the food is mediocre leaning more towards bad."}
{"text":"This experience was a lot different than my last.  Service isnt perfect but a lot better than last time. The salmon sashimi was not mixed with old sashimi this time, all fresh. The beef short ribs were cooked perfectly.  Overall, this was a better experience than my last.  One thing I don't like about this place is soft drinks are not included with the AYCE dinner.  3/5"}
{"text":"For AYCE standards, I was not disappointed in quality of food and service here. I was actually impressed by their performance.   The sashimi and tataki were fresh. The maki was great. You order off an iPad which saves you the hassle of a waiter forgetting their stuff, because high school kids' memories are equivalent to ADHD on steroids.   The dessert menu was lacking, and they ran out of green tea ice cream (how does this happen on a Tuesday?)  Although the place is a bit pricey ($26.99 on weekdays), the fresh sashimi made up for that. If you order cooked food at AYCE, you're a chump.  Good place to bring the boys out to eat after a grueling workout. Wouldn't suggest bringing your gf or date here unless they actually pick up weights and aren't skinny like half these yelp elitists around here. AYCE is not for the weak stomached individual!"}
{"text":"came here with bf as a company gathering with coworkers  fancy decoration and ipad menu and order taking (the layout isn't the most user-friendly platform and the ipad with the huge case is heavy) but other than that...the most important part ie FOOD....is not good.  the warm food is not too bad but sashimi was disaster. and you know for jap dinner AYCE sashimi is what i really want!!!  i like the steam egg which has quite a lot of ingredient inside compare to other AYCE. i like that thing which is like a piece of deep fried wonton sheet holding some diced seafood and veggie. it has a lot of sauce i think it covers the bland taste of the fish...but this thing is so rich in sauce that it's already too much on the 2nd order. anyways.... don't go with you want sashimi. go to my all time fav Ichimoto for sashimi....   quite a wide selection of dessert - standard thing like icecream and mango yogurt, etc. don't really like the creme burlee. it isn't creme burlee.  personally i wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Quick Breakdown: +     Amazing sushi +     Grilled items are tasty -      Slow service Recommend: Yes  Full Review: A feeling of melancholy and nervousness filled my head weeks prior to my adventure here. I only realized later the sadness originated from my nostalgic feelings of stomach pains. My previous sushi experience led to a sick bag and a week of bed rest. Thus far, my journey towards the unexpected food greatness has led my perpetual hunger to a wide array of cuisines and has yet to disappoint (or induce sickness). During my latest venture, I visited Kiku, an AYCE Japanese restaurant. After reading great reviews on Yelp, I assured myself my worries were not troublesome. The sole purpose of my visit at Kiku: a dull family gathering (perhaps a review for Yelp as well).   Arriving at Kiku a waiter greeted us and led us towards our table- an alcove near the side of the room. Our table was specially designed as a traditional Japanese sitting. A waitress informed us that our shoes were required to be removed. The floors were furnished with carpet and the traditional Japanese cushions replaced the normal westernized sitting chair. Silver circle balls hung behind the table booth chairs. The walls were painted with pink flowers within a black background. The usage of the IPads to order food, exemplified the constant theme. The décor foreshadowed the menu and upcoming food, modernized and futuristic yet maintaining its Japanese roots.   Slowly, as each family member arrived, I was beset from all sides with waves/hellos (not particularly great for a person who has social anxiety problems). A fearful time, but I endured, and I live to write the review.  Perusing the menu, I picked each item to my desire. The touch screen was easy to navigate, obeying my every command. Cooked items were ordered indecisively. My first order consisted of: miso soup, seafood ramen soup, grilled squid, and other grilled items.  The miso soup tasted delicious, which was seasoned perfectly. The seaweed complemented well with the other ingredients. Although the soup itself does not innovate, the steamy, watery dish provided an amazing start to my meal.  The grilled meats (chicken, beef, etc.) were grilled to perfection, with perfect char marks. The grilled octopus tasted amazing. The squid was layered with a spicy and sweet sauce, which balanced the flavors together perfectly. The texture was perfect for my preference. Despite my praise, some of the meats lacked flavor.   The shrimp tempura was fried crispy and steaming hot. The texture was crispy, and soft on the inside. The sauce complimented well with the shrimp tempura.   The seafood ramen soup arrived nicely plated and designed in the bowl. Excited and hungry for noodle soup, I indulged into every ingredient, eating any item placed between my chopstick and mouth. The noodles were perfect texture and the seafood ingredients were fresh. Yet, the soup and flavor itself was bland, lacking any seasoning or seafood taste.    As the night progressed, the service slowed. Our ordered food items were late to arrive and created a disarray of who ordered what. The waitresses often gave us food that was not ordered from our table. Great food, yet I was greatly disappointed with the service.  Throughout the night, my mother frequently urged me to eat sushi and sashimi. The fear inside prevented me. However, in reality, I scornfully wanted to eat a piece and be rid of my distaste. Against my better judgment, I ordered an assortment of maki rolls and raw salmon.   And alas, I encountered my greatest fear! Using my chopsticks, I grabbed the closest piece to my plate. Scared stiffed from a raw fish, I put the saggy, watery piece near my mouth. As my hands shook in fear, I pondered... contemplated if the raw piece of fish would affect my health. Would my precedence of my past repeat itself?  And... I ate and swallowed the raw fish. The fish was fresh and tasted nice. Eating the fish instilled a sense of relief, battling and defeating my fear. Satisfied with the first piece of raw fish, I continued to eat sushi and sashimi throughout the night.    Each bite of maki rolls and sashimi reminded me of fond memories, of my past addiction to sushi. The maki rolls were nicely wrapped and the sashimi was soft in texture. Each plate of sushi was designed beautifully. The art represented the culture of the Japanese.      My venture to food greatness resulted in satisfaction. Once considered a Sisyphean task, Kiku allowed me to unequivocally remove my fears of sushi. Food greatness, lies within Kiku. Service is slow, the ramen is disappointing but the journey here is worthwhile. Heed these words, go forth in haste, and let thy hunger instincts be satisfied. Update 1: Maki rolls are not wrapped properly, breaking apart when you grab a piece."}
{"text":"How should I start. This is probably the worst dining experience I had with AYCE sushi. Service is bad, food is terrible. No idea how did they survive with so much AYCE competition in the area. So my hubby arrived earlier and tried to get seated. Being told no bench seatings are available, but clearly there are, plus more than enough other tables available at the same time. So he asked again and insist we'd like the bench sesting coz he does have back pain. So finally he got seated in one of the bench tables. After I saw the menu I was disappointed it didn't match what's not online. For some reason the pancakes and asparagus salmon are not in the menu. And their menu is not exciting at all, with very basic maki and sashimi options. And no soft drink incld. I was hungry, we ordered some sashimi and grills. The lamb skewers weren't bad. But the sashimi were cut too thin, you hardly can pick up mackerel piece by piece, it's always two pieces stuck together. Salmon sashimi weren't cut through and doesn't seem fresh, which was proven after dinner with my upset stomach. Ps. This is the only time I didn't order maki in a sushi restaurant, coz they just seem so ordinary and not appealing at all. The rest of the food were greasy. Desserts were over sweet. Servers are miserable with minimal interactions or manner. And once we ordered dessert the girl handed us the bill. But we only sat for an hour, it's not the end of night or last call. There's no one lining up. Why the rush?! I don't get it. So we paid and left. The bad experience lingers, middle of the night I was woken by this sharp pain in my tummy, proving the unfresh judgement of the fish... thrums down. And take your $$ somewhere else. There's plenty sushi options in the area."}
{"text":"An easy AYCE sushi place that delivers on what is expected. Nothing too fancy or unexpected, but you can find all your usual choices easily. The electronic menu makes it easy to order, especially with a large group as you can simply pass the tablet around and everyone can choose what they would like to eat.   Quality is acceptable and there is plenty of choices for everyone, if they like raw fish or not. The food comes out fast and furious once you send your choices in, so you aren't left wasting precious seating time waiting. A respectable AYCE sushi choice."}
{"text":"Good place to eat. The idea behind the I pad ordering is genius. The food is good and the service is good as well. I've been to this location multiple times and can't argue with the variety.  It is a little on the pricy side but defiantly well worth the money."}
{"text":"Kiku is a decent AYCE resto. I found the items to be decent to go. Ipad ordering system. Decent decor. Staff were really nice actually. I give Kiku props for that but the price is way too inflated at $28 per person for dinner. It didnt feel like I got my moneys worth. I wouldnt go back again either for dinner, way too pricey."}
{"text":"We came for lunch in a group of 10. The iPad menu ordering was fun and gimmicky.  I think it is good for small group, but it is not that convenient among big group.  This was because we only shared 1 iPad, so the people at the far end of the table could not read the menu.  I think if we were allowed more than 1 iPad, it would be better.  The food was quite fresh.  The maki was nice, but we all picked rice out of the hand rolls.  Yeah, they were very packed with rice.  The sushi was definitely fresh AND with too much rice.  The cooked food was quite delicious. There were a selection of desserts.  Note that the creme brulé was only an egg custard, not really a cream brulé.  The food came very quickly.  The service was friendly.  Overall, 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Bad service, server neglected to explain sending our order.  Server also was short and abrupt and didn't take time to listen to our complaint."}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi on a Saturday before Christmas in this place is a NO!   The place was too busy! There were bunch of kids who had come over as a group of 15-20, they were laughing and talking very loud all the time! Most tables around that area were affected by their disturbing noise.   The waitresses themselves were annoying and talking very loud to each other too, specially the person who is responsible for cleaning off the tables. She was literally throwing the dirty dishes into a big container inconsiderate to the annoying noise they might make! So this place is not a quite calm and relaxing place where you can enjoy talking with your partner.  On the other side the service is fast! It was really really fast! Once we ordered our sushi rolls, about 5 mins later they brought one by one. I am so happy with that fast response to our order because in most all you can eats you need to wait long time to get your sushi. However; We ordered rolls only. The only thing we ordered that had to be prepared in the kitchen was shrimp tempura, that took a long time to come! I think it was because the kitchen was too busy that day and most people were ordering beef and fried food instead of sushi.   The taste and quality of sushi rolls were good! I liked them, I cannot tell they were perfect but at that busy time of the day, I did not expect that good quality sushis we received! I am in love with salmon roses and they were absolutely great!  Overall the place is good if you go on weekdays and you love sushi!"}
{"text":"We have visited this place for lunch on Sunday, food was just okay but I felt so full after I ate and we did not eat a lot. I could only assume there was something added to food so you can feel full lol Other than that this is another regular all you can eat place. Food was max 3 stars and service was 2 stars. I tried ti thank waiters view times but they did not reply to me I guess its not necessary anymore"}
{"text":"Pretty good Jap AYCE restaurant with iPad ordering. The food for the most part came REALLY quickly, so there was no hassle about asking the waiter/waitress again for where the order was. Food quality is on par or maybe a bit better than most jap ayce places so I'm fairly satisfied. Would visit again."}
{"text":"Kiku is an average Japanese AYCE run by Chinese people, as is usual in this area. I think it would be a great place for groups as the inside is very spacious, the decor is very modern, and the restaurant is clean. Though there is lots of room, Kiku enjoys lots of customers. During our weekday lunch the restaurant was pretty much full. I tried coming here for weekend dinner once but couldn't even get the attention of a server because there were already so many people in the restaurant waiting for a seat. Definitely make a reservation! Lunch is about $21 including tax. Not bad. Note that on the website, it says prices are a dollar or two more than the price they have listed for Fridays and weekends.  You order off an iPad, which is efficient - food came really quickly. Quality of the food was decent and pretty average. Nothing stood out in particular but nothing was really bad either, except maybe the eel pancake. We had heard good things about it but it was mostly dough and pieces of onion with barely any eel.   The sushi was good. Not the freshest or the best I've had at an AYCE, but definitely not bad. The pieces of fish could be thicker perhaps, but I understand why they would want to give us less of that and more rice to fill you up. The salmon rose had a good flavor to it - I took out most of the rice and mayo so it ended up being more like salmon sashimi.  Rolls were well made and tasted good, though we ordered too many with the same base. The dynamite roll base has a lot of cucumber in it because it's cheaper and fills you up. Half cucumber and half everything else so I was kind of sick of the cucumber by the end of our meal. Also for the rainbow roll and red dragon roll (dynamite with salmon on top) the amount of fish was minimal. Again, I understand their choices. Fish was still good though!  Everything else was pretty normal and there's not much else to say. Service was all right - efficient and no frills. People came by quite regularly to take our dishes, more often by the end of our meal because they obviously wanted us to leave. We were fine with them prompting us with dessert, asking if we were finished, and giving us the bill without asking - just a note that this might happen.  Overall a decent experience. I wouldn't come here on purpose over every other AYCE, but this is as good a place as any."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the All-You-Can-Eat Japanese food here.  Selection is decent, and the restaurant decor is beautiful.  I liked their ipads which are used for ordering, no need to wait for server to come to approve the ordered items unlike other Japanese AYCE restaurants.  The prices are about average compared to other AYCE places.  It's a bit loud though which I do not like.  Still it's a wonderful place to bring your friends if they don't mind the noise.  They are often busy though requiring waiting for a table."}
{"text":"Was craving AYCE sushi.  Came here with a friend and what could you say about AYCE places?  This place was decent.  Lots of menu options but what is with the white tuna???  This place had tons of dessert choices so we tried a lot of it.  Pretty cools using an ipad to order your food.  Less chances of mistakes.  Only thing I didnt like was that the rolls came in 6 pcs.  I like the AYCE places that allow rolls to be ordered by prices.   Would come back again."}
{"text":"Wednesday night around 7:30pm. Packed and waited about 15 min for a seat. I liked how the guy would come out to the door and shout out your name super loud to confirm if you are still waiting.   The layout of the ipad menu was very easy to follow. Plus you no longer have to feel embarrassed when you put in the quantity of sashimi you want since there is no human interaction when ordering.   The sashimi were sliced very thin. Two pieces equates to one normal piece in size. The only thing I really enjoyed eating were the beef tataki. Everything else was just blah. Even the desserts were blah. The quality of the food is definitely a step below expectations.  Service was also very slow at times. Some orders didn't even arrive. Its really not the servers fault. They are all working really hard. Its just that it was really busy and probably not enough workers.   Very disappointing and complained throughout the meal."}
{"text":"I loved this place. I came on a Thursday evening and it was packed. I was seated right away in a booth by the window. They have a la carte or ayce menu. I got ayce. Ordering from the iPad was easy and had no complications. The food came out fast, and was really flavourful and fresh.  I'll def go back there. 5stars :)"}
{"text":"This place has became our favourite place for Japanese AYCE. we love the speed of how the food were served, love sweet shrimp sashimi in particular and also the teriyaki lamb. Sweet shrimp sashimi is an expensive dish and I know only tenichi  has it during the weekend, however,  last time when we been to tenichi and they inform us we are on our last call for the sweet shrimp sashimi (cuz they don't want to give u too much of them), but kiku is different, they never limit how much u can order regardless how expensive the food is, will go back often !"}
{"text":"Not good AYCE Japanese restaurant.  The quality wasn't great and long line up for this restaurant.  If you want to go to AYCE with iPad ordering I would recommend heart sushi instead, more variety, better presentation and tastier!  Nothing memorable, was mediocre. Will not come back"}
{"text":"Meh, in all fairness I did have takeout, but it was unremarkable. The tempura tofu was enormous, salmon sashimi was good and the dynamite roll was good.  When handed my order I got a \"here you go sir\".  Wait. What? I am decidedly female and have never been mistaken for a dude before. Not sure what to say about that."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money here for lunch, MAYBE come for dinner.   Came for AYCE lunch today and I'm really blown away at how awful the lunch menu was. I came here a while ago for dinner and it was really good. I even called it 'one of my favourite AYCE sushi restaurants' (going to have to take that back now...)  ALL the food we got for lunch was bland. There was nothing that was amazing, everything was just ok at best, or flat out not good. The \"grilled\" steak came boiled...   The worst things on the lunch menu: -ramen (NO taste at all)  -beef enoki roll (not seared or anything, no flavour...) -las vegas roll (biggest waste of calories for something that tastes like nothing) -mango pudding, mousse, etc. (Other than ice cream, the desserts were also bland AF)  Things that were OK: -salmon pizza -salmon rose sushi  -shrimp tempura  -deep fried bananas   Staff were quick and nice but doesn't make up for the lack of variety on the menu and low quality for high price to pay ($17.50 for lunch is a RIP OFF). Come for dinner only..."}
{"text":"I really liked this place, and I feel more restaurants (especially buffet types) should be like this. I honestly don't mind paying a little more knowing it's a relatively environment friendly restaurant (lack of paper needed to write orders down as it's all electronic).  The iPad menu is definitely one of the biggest attractions of this restaurant, however this isn't the only restaurant to offer this (there's one in Toronto that offers iPad menus as well). The buffet menu for dinner is quite extensive and offers a lot of (dare I say unique?) options, and I was generally satisfied with everything I ordered from the makis, rolls, sushi, sashimi, kitchen, and dessert menus.  If there's one complaint I'd say it's to limit on the amount of sushi or rolls you order, as their rice content is quite large. If you really want to try the fish, go for the sashimi option and you won't be disappointed as it's very fresh. Also, try not to take the first two or three seats in front of the restaurant especially if there's a cold north wind, as it would just rush into the restaurant.  Will I come back? Yes! However you really need an empty stomach, as $26.99 for an adult weekend dinner is quite a steep price."}
{"text":"I've come here multiple times, and it always has a great atmosphere and a wide selection of items on the AYCE menu.  I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"We made reservations for this restaurant for a busy Saturday night and we still had to wait for a LONG time before getting seated. The worst part was that there was no host/hostess to greet us so we couldn't notify the staff that we had reservations.  The service afterwards were thankfully good. We got all the food we ordered and the service was pretty fast. The quality of the food is just like any other AYCE sushi restaurants. Ordering off the iPad was pretty fun which was why we wanted to try out one of these restaurants. I wouldn't come back to this restaurant just because it's quite far from where I live but it's a decent place to try out if you're around the area."}
{"text":"I came here at 3 pm barely made it to the lunch special (ends at 3:30pm).    I had the vegetables tempura bento and it was so so in terms of quality.   It seems that they are known for their sushi and sashimi- so perhaps hot food dishes are not their strong points.   I would order non-bento dishes next time."}
{"text":"Kiki is about as average as an all you can eat sushi joint gets.  I'd give it a 3.5 if that were on option...  Maybe.   Menu is pretty extensive but a common theme I see with ayce Japanese and big menus is a lot of the items end up being super lackluster.    Rolls are okay,  lots of filler but nothing  out of the ordinary.    The short rubs are a lot better here than other ayce places,  which is surprising because their other beef dishes were over cooked,  tough,  and straight up gross.    Fried eel pancake had a few too many red peppers for my tastes.  Kind of over powered the eel,  which is pretty impressive!   Overall,  it's not bad.  For 100 bucks,  six people were fed during lunch,  which isn't too shabby.  I'd definitely check Kiki out if you're in the area,  but I wouldn't advise going out of your way for it."}
{"text":"Today was my fourth and final time at Kiku. From beginning to end, the experience was below expectations. I have been here for both lunch and dinner- the food quality has gone way down. The actual restaurant itself seems dirty (our table, iPad menu and the floors).  Notable items that led to this one-star rating:  Stacking plates- the servers stack plates, FULL plates of food to be served to tables. Even our tempura sauce was stacked on top of other bowls of sauce- confusing and off putting!  Nigiri- red snapper, salmon, mackeral fish were sliced embarrassingly thin. The rice was packed into massive, tight lumps at the highest point an inch tall. Very disappointing.   Sushi rice- soggy, overly sweet and too mushy. At times, difficult to taste individual grains.  Rolls-  red/ green dragon and rainbow rolls are pre-made and only topped with fish once ordered. The rice and filling in these rolls were refrigerator-temperature cold.  Spicy salmon sushi- too large, way too much rice. Is there a point to packing your sushi so full of poorly cooked rice?  Edamame- difficult to screw up? Think again. Water-logged and unsalted.   Missing orders were more frequent than they should have been for an ipad system. Service was indifferent and standoffish.   Would rather get better sushi at a quick take-out joint and have plenty of time to spare.  Can't think of a reason to come back. Much better AYCE can be found in the GTA."}
{"text":"The service is pretty quick compared to other places, and the ipad order system is always a bonus. I enjoyed the space and seating in the private booths.  The menu has an awesome variety and most of the sushi tasted great."}
{"text":"Was here for lunch with 3 others on a Saturday afternoon. The service was pretty good considering it was 3/4 full. Everything we ordered came in a timely manner, nothing went missing or some random dish appeared when we didn't order it. Two of the servers made small talk with us.   The food however, left much to be desired. The sushi pieces although well presented were packed full of rice with really really thin pieces of raw fish on top. I gotta give it up to the chefs here, I have never seen such a thin piece of raw fish. The rolls were well rolled and not falling apart but its just way too big and packed full of rice. The cooked food were alright, nothing tasted bad but it wasn't memorable either. I made the mistake of ordering a sushi pizza and it was HUGE. It's probably double or triple the size of other AYCE restuarants and its 4 pieces instead of 1 like some places. Good thing I had 3 other guys at the table to help me finish the pizza.   They do offer bento options, so I guess with all the big pieces of sushi its a pretty good deal for passable food. But I wouldn't come back for the AYCE since the sushi and rolls were just packed full of rice."}
{"text":"Kiku was one of the first places in the area to use iPads for ordering, which was an exciting concept!  Kiku offers a large selection of sashimi, sushi, tempuras, fried foods, etc. The seating is very comfortable as it is spaced apart unlike most AYCE sushis who try to accomodate as much seating as possible.  The iPad ordering is very efficient, food begins to arrive in ~5 mins! The only downside is that it is quite pricey, especially on weekends..and it does not come with any drinks, only water or tea."}
{"text":"I just had a server telling my 20 months old daughter that she is blocking her way, and ask my pregnant wife to take the hot dish from her...... this is the service that I cannot tolerate."}
{"text":"For a ayce joint, decent! Nice decor, if you get a booth very good privacy. The main thing that impressed me was how quickly the food came out. With the ipad orders, I didn't need a waiter to come by and approve it - we sent it ourselves and it went directly to the kitchen. Literally after we hit send, we got our first dish after 30secs. My fav items were: -fried banana (banana was hot enough to have melted a bit inside)  -mushroom muscle soup (the herby taste was tasty and different than ive had before) -crab mayo roll (nice and creamy good meat filling) -forget what it was called but it was a 8pcs roll that had eel and salmon flakes on top good taste profile -mango pudding we had either had green mango or a bit less ripe mango which was great for a little tartness -amaebi was available  A lot of other items were average tasting and menu isn't actually as varied as some other places, and the price is a bit steep, but I would consider coming back if I wanted ayce."}
{"text":"This place is ok, been here couple times, first time was my choice, other times were birthday parties. It's regular Japanese all you can eat, except you order with a iPad.. You can't play games or use it for anything else tho...  Even when ordering with an iPad, the orders still don't come 100% and sometimes is slow, not my favourite jap ayce place, but would visit if others ask me to go"}
{"text":"Decided to come here for supper. We decided to order a la carte instead of AYCE. I had the teriyaki beef bento box and my wife had the 18 piece sashimi combo. Both our orders came with miso soup and a salad. The food came quickly, however they had forgotten my wife's rice.  My bento box was a nice portion and tasted good ( the teriyaki beef was a bit more red than what I like). My wife said her sashimi was also good. We decided to share green tea ice cream. We were both well fed and it cost us less than AYCE."}
{"text":"Everything was fast and the order was quick cuz the service was using iPad witch new. The food was fresh too! Over all very good!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time on Saturday for dinner reservation made at 6pm. It was pretty busy when we came in there were about.. 15-20 people waiting in the front and outside of the restaurant - so I'd recommend giving a call before coming here on a weekend.  For an AYCE sushi restaurant, I was really impressed at how the dinner service went. Ordering from an iPad made it so much smoother cause we didn't have to worry about any miscommunication about what we wanted. Normally, whenever we order at AYCE places, it takes forever for the food to arrive (it's usually even worse on weekends), so we ordered a ton of food just incase it would take decades to arrive. But to our surprise ALL of our food arrived so fast that we quickly ran out of table space and we were shoveling our food into our mouths.  The sushi rolls weren't those tiny sushi rolls that you'd be disappointed to see once it arrives at your table. Everything was great.  The only thing stopping me from giving them 5 stars was when the server ran up to us and told reminded us in a very discourteous manner that we were approaching our 2 hour limit and that we had remind our server two times that we had asked for water (which never arrived)."}
{"text":"The gimmick is you have an iPad to place your own order which match nowaday lifestyle. However it will result zero communication between server and customers. The host doesn't really speak English so does some of the staffs as well. I guess that's why they provide an Ipad for you. The food runner brought out food quickly after you sent the order. $16 for ayce lunch it cover quite alot of variety and taste as expected."}
{"text":"I've been here a number of times for lunch (so this review only reflects that time of day) with varying experiences.  ie: Inconsistent.  The cost per person is $15.50 for all you can eat (minus the drinks) and it's a pretty reasonable price for the fact that it's all you can eat (AYCE).  You make your orders on an iPad, click Send and then they bring you your food.  Simple, right?  One flaw of this is if you need to adjust your order slightly, you can't 'really' do that since you just click items and send for it.  (ex: If you want no sauce.)  Some of their food is good, some aren't.  I don't eat any seafood so I can't really vouch for that.  My sister didn't seem terribly impressed by it, so even though you aren't going to get top-notch sushi at an AYCE place, I was a little disappointed to hear she wasn't terribly fond of it.  I'd personally pass on the ramen because I found the noodles taste like nothing.  The soup base that I got helped, but wasn't adding enough.  The tempura is also unimpressive (at least with the sweet potato) as the sweet potato was reasonably hard inside, making it somewhat ruin the decent batter.  Most everything else I've had there were good or above that - chicken teriyaki, udon, miso soup and a few other rice dishes.  Keep in mind that, by nature, fried foods take longer to make so if you're waiting on deep fried scallops or chicken wings (for example), it's better if you order them at the start of your stay to be more time efficient.  The wait staff have been the most inconsistent there.  A few times I've been there, they're pretty emotionless and don't really seem to care about you.  Other times, you'll get others that seem pretty happy to serve you and will make sure you leave with a good impression.  It's been pretty up and down with my experiences there.  One thing that may bug people is that they do have a time limit of 90 minutes.  If you go near the start of lunch, you're probably going to need to be careful with your time.  If you go near the end of the lunch time, they just leave you be since the place is pretty dead late-lunch time.  So I'd recommend going around 1:00, if you can help it, for a late lunch if you tend to order a lot or are slower at eating.  At the end of the day, Kiku's food ranges from below average to above, depending what you get. I really would like to see their waiters and waitresses be a little more consistent with their service than they are though.  There are good things about this place, there are bad.  If you like Japanese food, I could recommend this place for a try.  At least for lunch."}
{"text":"Love this place the food is really good and service is also good as well . They are pretty busy so always plan to show up a little earlier their prices are pretty decent as well. And large variety of foods to order from"}
{"text":"I'm really disappointed because I used to love this place! Not sure what happened but the last couple of times I've been, 1) the food quality declined a lot (seafood was not fresh, quantities come based on whatever they feel, cooked food is cold). 2) someone asked us to leave as we had apparently been there too long (1.5 hrs and we were a group of 7). 3) prices have gone up and they no longer accept credit card. 3) you could feed a small country with the amount of excess rice they put in their rolls as \"filler\". I will never come back... your money is better spent elsewhere"}
{"text":"Decor and ambiance were the only thing great here! Foods below average compared to other ayce. Tempura and other fried items had alot of coating to make it bigger. Beef items were all well done. Had a hard time chewing today. Mehh."}
{"text":"Paraphrasing the game Portal, the sushi is a lie.   Just to be clear, the words, \"all you can eat\" will never win me over.  It doesn't matter if it's hot wings, crab legs, or sushi--especially if its sushi.  Whenever on a business trip, I attempt to ensure that my few restaurant outings are worth my time.  I research the options, limiting often to within reasonable reach of my hotel.  Kiku appeared on the short list, revealing once again how unfortunately unreliable most restaurant review sites really are.  It was so depressing that I made a point to attempt a second dinner that same night, pushing my digestive drive past warp nine, giving it all she's got...err, captain.    Kiku--honestly sounding like a photocopy machine company--didn't immediately advertise their \"all you can eat\" option...or the fact that it was the ONLY option.  I saw a bar outside, but alas, there were no bar stools.  I eventually found myself marooned in a strangely shaped booth second guessing my culinary choice when the waitress pulled out an iPad menu.    Ehhwhaaaaa?!    That's right, the entire menu was on iPad, and not just a PDF of options, but a wireless ordering system.  I could surf through the options, select what I wanted, and transmit that to the kitchen, doing so as often as I liked.  This was very similar to, but a lot cheaper than, Inamo in London, where the menu was displayed on your table via overhead projectors with a touch screen interface.  That was amazing, very expensive looking.  This was less so, but still worthy of admiration, especially so if married to a kitchen that took pride in their food.  This was not the case, as nothing delivered matched their digital representations.  Everything you see on their website or on their iPads is a falsehood.  Returning to the opening sentence, the sushi is a lie.    Stepping back, and not in the psychological fashion, Kiku looked impressive, not offering the inkling at all that it's basically a Red Lobster.  A gorgeous layout involving matching brown chairs with short backs running parallel with walls fashioned from crystal beads, add that with iPad ordering machines, and Kiku looks amazing.  But then I was asked if I wanted the all you can eat option, \"asking\" being equated to \"assuming\".  In truth, it was the only option.  My instinct yelled at me to leave that very moment, as obviously I had made a dreadful mistake, but my flight or fight instincts were clearly not working.  I fired off my first set of orders, a cone, a roll, and an assortment of nigiri.  Nothing delivered resembled the photos, not by a longshot.  There was no platting, no finesse of any kind.  The rice was lazily assembled, leading to numerous disintegrations.  The cone was half open, as was the roe sushi, the latter being an oddity as I didn't order one.  I also ordered a surf clam nigiri that never arrived, meaning the order system is either not working properly or mistakes are being made in the kitchen.    The actual sushi really wasn't bad, but I found the lazy approach of their assembly insulting to the spirit of the craft.  So I gave up and ordered something non-sushi.  The delivered udon, along with everything else, was positively microscopic, though surprisingly tasty, a small spark in this depressing darkness, marred by one unfortunate fact...I didn't order udon; I ordered ramen.  Sigh.  Perhaps the dessert will do better, so I opted for a black & white moose which was served apparently in a shot glass.  The waiter even commented as I got up to settle the bill, that I had only ordered one dessert, as most people get four or five.    Kiku is meant for rejects from the glutton role in the movie Se7en, wanting enough food to burst their stomach.  Kiku is everything that's wrong sushi in North America, everything that sours its reputation.  Admittedly, Kiku's fish wasn't bad, but everything else around it was.  A year ago almost to the day, I was last in Toronto at this same region of town, so I know that three blocks down the road, there is Akasaka, a far superior sushi restaurant.  At $24.50, the solitary price for \"all you can eat\", it's not even that good a deal.  There's a similar place in my home town, which started promising, but got progressively worse.  It's a natural side effect of these kinds of places--quality will always be a casually when quantity is all that matters.  Food:  2/5 Service:  2/5 Presentation:  1/5 Value:  2/5 Recommendation:  2/5"}
{"text":"This place is pretty subpar. I guess you come here to eat a ton of food? But almost none of it is very good. There are better ways to eat sushi in the area, and even better AYCE."}
{"text":"First time trying this place with Ipad ordering! The Food and atmosphere is very well."}
{"text":"My most recently (and first) visit to Kiku in Markham was for lunch on a weekend. Upon arriving I was immediately presented with an interactive iPad menu that I perused while awaiting the arrival of my friend. My first impressions of the iPad was that it was significantly easier to manage compared to other all-you-can-eat sushi bars where you must use a paper and pencil. Having eaten at another well-known sushi bar with iPad-based ordering I was familiar with the concept of selecting the item, viewing a photo of it, indicating how many you wanted, and adding it to an order list to be submitted to the kitchen. In my opinion, Kiku's system was by far the best for ordering as you still have the ability to view which items you have ordered previously. Not only does this help you keep track of what you have tried, it also allows you to see what you have not yet received. Being able to order on-demand means there is no need to flag down or wait for staff to attend to your table. Everything can be taken care of from the iPad meaning no language barriers, long waits, and best of all, the ability to see the item along with a brief description of it.   What really stood out to me was the selection offered at Kiku. Despite it being lunch, I was very impressed with the wide array of choices available including several types of soup salads, signature rolls, fried rice/noodles, grilled items, and sushi pizzas to name a few. Surprisingly, Kiku offers three types of Japanese savoury pancakes (Okonomiyaki) at lunch. Dessert selection was also very good and significantly larger than other AYCE sushi bars I've visited. Drinks (alcoholic or non) are extra. Between my friend and myself, we tried at least one dish from each category. Items arrived quickly after ordering ensuring that we enjoyed the items at optimum temperature. All of the choices we had were fresh and tasted as if they were made to order (very important for grilled/fried items). My top 5 suggestions off the menu include the Las Vegas Roll, Spicy White Tuna Tempura Roll, Seafood Fried Ramen, BBQ Eel Pizza, and the Ginger Milk dessert (very strong, perfect for ginger lovers). Bonus points for the Mackerel sushi that (to me) was the perfect texture/taste.   As far as decor goes, Kiku is quite pleasing to the eye thanks to the interesting glass-balls-on-strings which adorn the dining area. The restaurant has a very modern feel and is inviting. I felt very relaxed while eating (thanks in part to not having to worry or think about if our orders will arrive). Interesting to note, there is at least one 6-8 person \"Japanese-style\" table where guests take off their shoes and sit on a carpeted floor. This seems like it would be a fun experience, however you most likely have to reserve this spot for your dining group. Cleanliness in the dining area appeared good. The washrooms on the other hand could use some work. The men's chrome bathroom fixtures (taps, urinal flushers) were very dirty with dust/waterspots. It appeared as if they had not been cleaned properly in some time.    My overall impression of Kiku was very good and I most certainly will be returning. Pricing is on par with other AYCE sushi bars at $15 for lunch and $24 for dinner. Friday/Weekend/Holiday prices are $1 more for lunch and $2 more for dinner."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times now! Overall the food is decent, but the fried food such as tempura or breaded shrimp was heavily breaded in my opinion. I wasn't a huge fan of the fried items they had. The rolls and sashimi generally tasted fine, some tasted better than others - but in the ayce world, quality of the food was  average. They also have a range of variety which is also a plus.  The cool thing is, you can order via an ipad, but the down side was sometimes they miss your order....had to call them numerous servers to follow up with our orders. (Happened the last two times I came here)  I would still come back, but not often."}
{"text":"[LOCATION] - 4/5 Located at the plaza with Congee Queen on Highway 7 E and Commerce Valley Dr E.  [SERVICE] - 3/5 Average. Food was ordered with an iPad, and the dishes arrived to our table pretty quickly. Servers cleared our empty dishes in a decent amount of time, but they did not really interact with us.   [DÉCOR] - 4/5  The beaded curtains were actually kind of pretty. All the seats were very comfortable, and made out of a couch-like material.   [FOOD QUALITY] - 4/5 The quality here is as good as it gets for an all-you-can-eat sushi buffet. The price is relatively high compared to other AYCE sushi spots, but in my opinion, you get what you pay for.   [ORDER] - 4/5 All-You-Can-Eat Fri-Sun & Holiday Dinner Menu - $29.00: sashimi was fresh, sushi-to-rice ratio was perfect for me (less rice, more sashimi), avocado was perfectly ripe, and cooked dishes are not fantastic but pretty good.   **PROTIP: Eat here on your BIRTHDAY. The birthday boy/girl gets a free meal if you have more than 4 people at your table!**   [OVERALL] - 4/5 This is my go-to spot for AYCE Sushi. I would recommend this place if you enjoy eating an obnoxiously large amount of sushi, sashimi, and other Japanese-inspired goodies."}
{"text":"Hot foods came out lukewarm. Raw sushi tasted unpleasant. I use to like this place but quality of food has gone down horridly."}
{"text":"Not our first time here and as far as AYCE places go this one is ok.  The food comes out pretty quickly for kitchen items but it's a longer wait for sushi items.  The decor at first glance is pretty WOW but after being seated for a while you notice how tired and damaged so much of it is.    The washrooms are disgusting and coming from a guy you know it's gotta be bad.   Water everywhere, mountains of waste overflowing the receptacles, no soap in the soap dispensers.  I went to the handicap washroom hoping for better...nope.  they use that room to store their mops and vacuum!  Overall the food was fairly bland, flavourless.  Staff was fast but curt.  We were a big group and instead of placing the dishes in the middle of the table they chose to put them on the corner of the table right where people were eating which became really ridiculous as the people on the corner became secondary servers.    The worst part was when the bill came at the end and they informed us that they don't take credit cards. Being a big group we don't exactly carry around large wads of cash back cover off 15 people so it was a big inconvenience for us to have to use debit or cash for the few people who actually had that much cash on hand.  Next time I would think we'll be better off opting for a proper restaurant where you have service.  Perhaps will pay a little bit more but the quality of the food and the service is worth it."}
{"text":"One of the growing number of iPad AYCE's out there so decided to give it a try.  This place isn't terrible in terms of food, but price is not really worth it; you can probably get better quality and service at other non-iPad places (might I suggest Sushi Legend on Finch).  The atmosphere is pretty nice; the bubble décor (if they still have it) were kinda pretty with the purple theme. Although, luckily for me, the power went out half way through my lunch that day and it was never restored when I left. Good thing it was during the day so it wasn't dark. The service slowed down, but didn't stop - which I applaud them for.   In my opinion, a lot of AYCE's are lucky service charge is already included, because some places certainly don't deserve it. I mean, customers wouldn't want to see your annoyed/displeased expression when serving them. The servers at this place could be a bit cheerier here to earn them another half rating or so.  All in all, food wasn't bad here, service was ok-ish. If you're looking for your first iPad AYCE experience, this can be a place to try."}
{"text":"2.5 stars.   I haven't been to Kiku in a while but decided to try it out this week for their lunch menu. The iPads are a nice touch, the service is very fast and accurate, but the quality of fish is not the greatest.   My favourite item on the menu was the salmon rose. However, for the amount that I ate, I would prefer to go to an a la carte restaurant that has better quality.   For AYCE I would stick with KaKa."}
{"text":"Lots of variety and food is fresh and delicious. A very good price for this quality in terms of all you can eat.  Cannot find this quality and taste in downtown (all u can eat). I especially like the spicy salmon handrolls, come as much as I wanted! Recommend lunch, much better price with as much food except sashimi."}
{"text":"Waiting time: Extremely LONG during peak hours (45+ minutes just to be seated on Friday / Saturday night of a long weekend during the warm season) & the waiting space is desperately inadequate.  Food delay: Order submission to arrival time is very short. This is 1 area that nobody can realistically criticize.  Service: Many (close to most) of the servers are inexplicably miserable: no smiles, not even eye contact.  Atmosphere: If it matters, the acoustics cause the crowded restaurant to be very loud during peak hours.  Price: Considering the competition in the area, KiKu is relatively expensive for all you can eat sushi buffet.  Cleanliness: Generally, it's sufficient, but they should definitely make an effort to clean the iPads (used for ordering food) more often.  Miscellaneous: Unless you're having ice cream, skip the dessert options entirely; the selection, helping size, and presentation, are pitiful.  Conclusion: There are Japanese / sushi restaurants nearby of comparable quality for less $$."}
{"text":"We came here last Saturday for all you could eat lunch. This was my first time here and pretty happy! The restaurant is beside congee wong, in the same plaza.  When we walked through the doors, we were immediately greeted and seated. The place was pretty packed for lunch time but there as a couple of  empty seats. Walking in, I already could tell that this place was going to be different that most of the sushi chains I have been to. The place is beautiful from the inside. I wished that I took more pictures of the place.   To order, it was an IPAD and super quick. The server didn't have to come to our table to confirm our order which was nice. The food came out pretty quickly and the servers were amazing. Got us tea, water, fork with my niece and she also chatted her up which was so cute. Trying to get her to eat more.   The only thing I did not like was the seafood soup in the apps. I can't quite put my finger on the taste but the mussel was good! The dynamite rolls were amazing and I loved the spicy salmon sushi that is wrapped around with seaweed. So yummy, the bbq eel was just as yummy.   I would definitely come back here. It was so affordable, the service was quick and they were friendly!   Happy Eating yelpers!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend says this is one of her most favourite all you can eat sushi joints in the area. I don't usually enjoy sushi but this place was not bad. There's lots of options to choose from and the system of ordering is with the iPads. All the food basically comes out at once- ready for your snapchats. We noticed that they are very attentive to the orders as everything that we quantified on the iPad came exactly, no more or less (other restaurants seem to just guess how many tempuras or sashimi you order, making it too much or not enough).   I like specifically  how they don't stuff their hands rolls with excess rice! Same for their maki rolls too. They also offer a wide variety of desserts (mango yoghurt is the best).   Service is fast and the restaurant has a nice decor. Would definitely recommend if you're looking for an AYCE sushi place."}
{"text":"your typical all you can eat sushi restaurant. been there, done that."}
{"text":"The service was very quick, loved the ambiance, and the servers were also quite friendly. I just wouldn't recommend the salmon pizza or the beef tataki but overall, the food was great!"}
{"text":"Terrible sushi and terrible service. Granted, we were a large group and I understand large groups can be hard to handle but the staff went out of their way to give us a bad time. They told us that we couldn't move around the table - which I thought was outrageous because this is what happens with big groups. They also tried to get some of us  to move to the other table mid way through our meal... this isn't something that you request your customers to do after they've gotten comfortable.   I will say that the food came quickly and ordering through the tablet was pretty easy after an initial period of struggle. However, the quality - even for an AYCE place - is seriously lacking. They also didn't have half the dessert menu available when we went (and didn't bother to tell us after we ordered said unavailable items)."}
{"text":"Usually, the AYCE sushi restaurants in Markham have better food quality and a wider selection compared to the restaurants that we have in Mississauga, but in this case, I was sorely disappointed. We went to Kiku on Sunday at noon and without making a reservation, our party of 6 was seated right away.You order the food and can submit it directly to the kitchen without waiting for a server to click on something on the iPad (that's a bonus) and the food came out almost right away.The only deep fried item that was good was the torpedo shrimp (it was super fresh, crunchy and piping hot), while all the other ones that we ordered (mushroom caps with shrimp, deep friend chicken wings and calmari) were all hard and seemed like it was re-friend. The raw fish in the handrolls and regular rolls were fresh, but in general, the sushi rolls were too big for my liking (probably twice the size of the ones that I'm used to). There wasn't a lot of selection in terms of salad, just a regular house salad and seaweed salad. The shrimp skewer didn't look like the picture in the iPad (peeled, giant shrimp on the stick), the ones that came to the table was one single shrimp with it's peel on, and it was impossible to take the peel off. The dessert was the usual fare, an assortment of ice cream, mango yogurt/mousse/pudding, coconut pudding, deep fried banana. It was my first time to Kiku, and unfortunately, that was also my last time."}
{"text":"This is my second time visiting this restaurant. It's no KaKa but okay for the price and quality. There isn't much of a waiting area and it can get quite crowded during peak hours. You are given a 2 hour time limit upon being seated. No surprise as this establishment seems to rush their customers to finish and even gives you a heads up when your time is almost done.You are given an iPad to order your food and it comes out whenever the items are ready.   As far as customer service there isn't much. I came in with a wheelchair and the employees were not very accommodating. When we asked for a wheelchair accessible table the employer gave a rude response instead of being understanding of the situation. Not very happy with the customer service."}
{"text":"Tonight is my first time go there and it will be also my last visit. The food was not that great, sashimi was not that fresh and they were sliced pretty thin. Customer service is the worst part of this restaurant!The table sits beside me were a Chinese family of 3 and they obviously don't speak English. Unfortunately what I see is all the servers keep on speaking English to them and they don't even bother whether the customers understand or not. I know the servers do speak Chinese because I heard them speaking Cantonese and Mandarin with their coworkers. When my boyfriend  ask for the bill, the girl didn't reply if she heard us or not...like...I'm just asking for a small reaction to show that you know we want our bill. After the bill came and I paid with my credit card, the girl just throw the receipt on the plate where I just had dinner with! The receipt was full of soy sauce, rice, and grease! I'm so regretted that I actually give them 10% tips. It will be my last visit to this restaurant and I would rather spend the money on other AYCE sushi place."}
{"text":"Every time I eat at Kiku, the service gets worse and worse.   Most recent visit involved extremely late, wrong orders, and ones that never showed up. Case in point: initial order had the usual yam & shrimp tempura, miso soup (which servers never took away for nearly 10 mins, despite walking by a number of times), chicken and beef teriyaki. The yam and shrimp showed up nearly an hour into our meal.  Same thing happened with some orders of sushi. One set showed up twice, thirty minutes later.   As usual and like others have mentioned, wrong orders are placed at your table, some portions are inconsistent in serving size. Empty dishes aren't taken away in a timely matter.   Food is decent; spicy tuna that I had during my last visit was really dry and unpleasant to eat."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night, we were suprisingly seated right away. They handed us an iPad menu and we got started for the All you can eat dinner. Each food item came very quickly one by one which was goood.   The food itself was very hit or miss. It was either really good or really bad.  The sushi was okayyy for AYCE. The ribs were amazing. The miso soup was good. The ramen was horrible, tasted like it was straight outta a ramen noodle cup. The desserts were simple;  ice creams and mango mousse and puddings.  All worth a try.   For the price of 29$ you might as well try everything once and fill up on what u actually like."}
{"text":"Rating: 3.5/5  Warning, this review was written under severe sushi-itis.  I came here for the first time by default because my original restaurant choice was closed.  Having said that, I really had no expectations and only knew that it was \"recently opened\" with an iPad ordering concept for all you can eat sushi ($24 weekday dinner).  They have quite a variety of appetizers, sushi, sashimi and etc. that you can order at your fingertips, literally. The waiter will most likely give you a short tutorial on how to order via the table's iPad so no sweat about that! The beauty is that there is a picture for all the items on the menu so if you're a sushi virgin, it's the perfect place to be. I really like how prompt the service and the food arrival is! I feel like right after I sent my order, it came the next second.  A few setbacks about this place are some of the items on the menu. We often complain about how some items \"are not like the pictures\" but some were way off including the very disappointing crème brûlée and one of my favorites, the green dragon roll. To my surprise, in the green dragon roll, I found eel inside which I don't eat instead of the typical shrimp that I am used to.  When I got the bill, I asked if I could pay cash and luckily got 10% off with the \"Manager special\". I believe their grand opening special is over by now as it was only for the first month..   Overall it's a nice place to be with friends, a date or simply with the family! There are lots of tables and even a private room for large parties along with a traditional no shoes seating area."}
{"text":"The deep fried milk is to die for. A must have when eating here. You get to order from an iPad."}
{"text":"came here on a busy saturday night with a large group.  after a long wait, i was impressed at the service.    the food came quickly and virtually no menu items were lost or did not come out.  it was essentially a dinner with no problems which is shocking since i frequent alot of AYCE sushi places on the regular...   i was shockingly impressed with the speed and service... food is a-ok.  nothing too crazy or new.. but has all the basics plus some good grilled items.  heres a tip for you...  they have a 10 percent coupon at ccue. its pretty much ongoing... so make sure you print it before you go.  If you cant read chinese, on the right column, wait for the ad to come up and click it."}
{"text":"Overall the food was good. Décor was nice but not too kid friendly, my son kept playing with the dangling chains in the back drop. Chairs were not booster seat friendly so had to place him on the booth side.  Good variety of food and they even had sweet shrimp sashimi which more rare at jap buffets. The hot food that we ordered were well done too. Prices has gone up from what they posted on their website $6.00 for child less than 4 age and $25.99 for adults (probably due to our dollar dropping so much). The restaurant temperature was set to very hot, maybe to make people thirsty so they would have to buy their drinks (drinks are not included except for tea and water). My family and I went early 5:30 pm to beat the rush. As we left, packs of people were lining up.  Will be back, hopefully the quality of their food is maintained."}
{"text":"Decent AYCE sushi that you order from an iPad! They were able to accommodate for food allergies after talking to the manager. Enjoyed the deep fried banana and the salmon pizza (like a deep fried rice patty) but skip the chicken ramen as it's totally tasteless!"}
{"text":"I went here a few times for sushi at lunch. They have raised the price to around $16 and to be honest I cannot recommend this place.   They have the iPads and the nice venue, but the food was just. not. good. They don't have sashimi during lunch ayce but had the rice included version which is fine. I don't eat fish, but even I could tell it didn't look that fresh. It was also little slivers on a mound of rice. Usually I go for the teriyaki meats and other stuff other than fish. I ordered the dynamite and green dragon and it did not taste good at all. The beef cubes with mushrooms were so peppery and dry. Thinking back, almost all of the meats that we ordered were dry af and almost inedible. The shrimp teriyaki was limp and unloved. I was not impressed.   The pros I have is that everything came lightning fast. They also actually give you everything that you asked for. Usually the portions are small so I doubled up on stuff that I like. That was a mistake as we had too much food because they were full sized portions AND they didn't miss the orders.   I love sushi, and really don't care for service, but the food was almost inedible and disappointing for AYCE. I will not be back for a long while and hope they improve."}
{"text":"I have been here for lunch a couple of times and was impressed by the food, the interior décor the service and how busy it was. The nearby Captain's Boil was almost empty.  The food on the AYCE lunch menu was reasonably priced and tasty. I liked everything that I tried, so I can't single out any specific item. The place looked great although there was some signs of wear and tear in the passage leading to the washrooms.  The last time I was there was on a rainy Friday at 1:30. There was a lineup. I was seated at 1:45. After I placed my order, the food came quickly. Fortunately, I always place two or more orders at an AYCE restaurant, so my food does not get cold. Service was efficient. I did recognize a couple of employees who had worked at restaurants that I had eaten at in Mississauga."}
{"text":"This is a step up from your typical AYCE sushi restaurant. You get to order off iPads and the decor and ambiance is nice. You do get a large proportion of rice on your sushi rolls, but that is common for most buffets.   They do have a wide.range of other dishes you can try. Especially for dinner, there's mussels and lamb and other good stuff. Food comes out fast and servers are very efficient."}
{"text":"I got sick!! Even though it's not often that I get sick  from food!   I don't eat meat or fish. So I ordered everything that doesn't have meat.  They don't make it easy for vegans to make their choices.  Either way I got sick that night and the day afterwards  because of it.  30$ for dinner for that quality that was horrible!"}
{"text":"I used to come here a lot when they first opened. Came to Kiku for lunch AYCE sushi today. When we first arrived it was quite busy which I guess could excuse for the rice droppings we found in my sister's glass of water(strike 1). Finished my water half way through my meal and left my empty glass to my left as a hint for a waiter to offer a refill; the restaurant was empty by then so I couldn't see why they didn't come around to refill... instead I saw the waiters chatting amongst themselves and going on their phones(strike 2). The last strike was the hair found in their mango mousse dessert."}
