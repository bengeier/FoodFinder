{"text":"This is a most disappointing Chinese restaurant. The building is frighteningly dirty with the look of \"oldness.\" Their weekday buffet is boring and the food frequently looks like it's been sitting there a long time. The food itself is blas√©. No real taste of sesame on the sesame chicken, and the cashew chicken is bad. It's a shame that it's the only place in Oregon. Do yourself a favor and go to Chang Jiang in Fitchburg instead."}
{"text":"Met my mom for here during lunch time, which is the only time they have the buffet. Evenings are dine-in or carry-out, no delivery service as of yet.  We were greeted and invited to take a seat anywhere we like. The offerings are limited to one hot station, one cold station, and a ice cream chest of different flavors of ice cream.  The hot station contained your standard offerings, fried rice, lo mein, sweet and sour chicken, general Tso's chicken, chicken and broccoli, egg drop soup, hot and sour sour, fried garlic green beans, and more. The portions in the treys are small, however the chef from the kitchen was continuously refilling the goods - keeping everything fresh, we all know there's nothing worst than crispy morsels of fried rice!  The hot station contained some desserts as well, fried sesame balls and sugar donuts!  The cold station had seasonal fruit offerings, as well as canned, pre-made desserts, and tapioca pudding, which I had two helpings of.  I really like the offerings of all the different tubs of ice cream, there was cookies and cream, vanilla, chocolate, rocky road, butter pecan, and two others. It's self-serve too!  There is probably a saying, if you've been to one Chinese buffet, you've been to them all. But I really like the cleanness of Moonstar and of course, the choice of ice cream flavors!"}
{"text":"Have had a lot of disappointments here before, but maybe finally figured out what I should only order. Grabbed pork fried rice and Mongolian Beef to go. Beef was tender actually, and plentiful. Was pretty good. Have had Gen Tsao's before, oh and many other things and just cant order that here anymore."}
{"text":"The food there was so good. Especially the General Tso's chicken. I will come back here often if I was yo"}
{"text":"Came here late night probably an hour before they close with my husband and children, staff was friendly and food was great, i live in stoughton and couldnt find a good chinese restaurant and im glad i had stopped here last minute, i would definitely be here again"}
{"text":"Okay we all know that finding a good Chinese place is difficult- this is not a good place. It is one of the few options in Oregon so we thought we would try it out. The chicken and beef were very strange textures and overall the meal did not go well with our stomachs. They have their kids working and hanging out there, cleanliness is poor, and they messed up our order. If you're going to still go here, I would recommend the General Tso chicken as that was the only thing decent."}
{"text":"How this place has three and a half stars I do not know. But I could probably have guessed because there are never more than 2 cars in the parking lot. Five of us ate dinner here and five were disappointed.  My parents are vegetarians, so they ordered veggie lo mein and mapo tofu--the tofu was soft, like gelatin. Not the right kind of tofu for stir fry. The texture was off putting to say the least, and for some reason they served it in a takeout container. The lo mein was mushy and greasy.  I ordered the cashew chicken, and the chicken tasted off. The carrots were cut into giant cubes, and everything was barely cooked. My son ordered some chicken noodle soup, and they literally brought us out a pint container of soup. The server asked if he would like a spoon, and that was the moment I realized what a disappointment the meal would be.  I will never be back, and I do not recommend it. It's a shame, too, because there are so few restaurants in Oregon that if they were decent they could make a killing."}
