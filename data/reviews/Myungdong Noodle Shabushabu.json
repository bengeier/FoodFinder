{"text":"Came here on Sunday afternoon with my husband. Restaurant was so clean and waitresses were very kind and attentive - wanting to please.  We had the shabu shabu with fish ball add ins.  It was very delicious and extremely filling. I loved all the vegetables.  After the soup they made the rice porridge with egg, seaweed and leftover soup. It was very good too but we were so full we couldn't finish.  Their kimchi was better than most other places.  Next time we want to try their massive dumplings.  So happy with this new addition!"}
{"text":"It was our first time trying Shabu Shabu and it was delicious! The place was packed but we were seated rather quickly. The food was great but the service was a bit lacking (as expected with Asian places, a bit of a language barrier). Will be back to try the ginormous dumplings (please excuse my ignorance but that's what we saw but were too stuffed to order)."}
{"text":"This is the place to be for authentic Korean noodles and shabu shabu (Korean hotpot, and yes I'm Korean)! Noodles are made in house and always fresh and consistent, and the broth is amazing! They have a few different types of noodles (the original broth, thick soybean broth and cold noodles - maybe summer special) and they are all excellent! I like that they keep the menu relatively small (with enough options) but do everything well. The combo with bulgogi/rice and a small bowl of noodles is such a great deal, and my husband is not a huge eater but devoured it all (and more). I always order too much but somehow end up finishing it all! I will be going back to try their shabu shabu maybe for dinner although they have an awesome lunch special shabu shabu I think!"}
{"text":"Myungdong Noodle Shabushabu is located in a hard-to-find strip plaza around the corner from Hurontario and Dundas.

MNS is a knock-off of the original Korean Myungdong Kalkooksu in Seoul, that specialzes in Kalgooksu (hand cut noodles) and mandu (dumplings), and their famous kimchi that is very garlicky and spicy.

MNS Mississauga, does a decent job replicating the concept. Their kalkooksu may be some of the best in the city, their mandu is good, but not as good as Mandu Hyung down the street, but their kimchi is spot on.

I have had their shabu shabu (hot pot), kalgooksu (hand cut noodles), mandu (Korean dumplings), bossam( steamed pork belly wraps), and mandu dok gook (rice cake with dumpling soup).

My fave dishes here: Bossam and shabu shabu. The bossam is cooked perfectly and comes with traditional toppings such as salted shrimp, lettuce wraps, and sam-jang (chili paste). The shabu shabu is great value and comes with a ton of vegetables! I wish they gave you more meat, but that's just me. At the end, they make this awesome Juuk (rice porrdige) with the leftover broth, seasame oil, thinly sliced kiim (roasted seaweed) and an egg. DELICIOUS

Check this place out. Service and quality of food is fairly consistent!"}
{"text":"I would probably rate this closer to 3.5 stars overall.
Food: 4/5
Service: 5/5
Pricing: 3/5
Selection: 3/5

This place is quite hidden, you enter in a small alleyway and it is tucked away in a plaza with ample parking. 

Food itself was good. I shared a shabu shabu package with my friends, which included a nice presentation and assortment of vegetables, meat, and noodles. Although we ordered a shabu shabu for 3 people, the portions were quite small -- not enough meat or noodles (especially with a male in our group!) For the price (~$15-20 pp), I had hoped for more. All shabu shabu packages come with a green salad appetizer.

I really enjoyed their homemade kimchi however. After the shabu shabu, the staff offered us their homemade congee (i.e. porridge), and I was already stuffed at that point, though probably from loading myself with kimchi and vegetables. The menu in itself is not too extensive, which can be a good thing for indecisive people, but at the same time offered limitations for customizations. 

The staff are attentive and frequently refill tea or kimchi as needed. Place is quite small, but clean and comfortable.

I would probably go back for the individual Korean entree options. Good attempt in Mississauga, but I think I'll consider venturing outside the city for all-you-can-eat shabu shabu if in a large group."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with a good friend who accommodated and selected this location just for me! We were initially going to do Korean fried chicken at the Fry, but selected this location for something heartier and more homey. In that case, what else is better than soup? 

Based off her recommendation, I chose to order the dumpling rice cake soup. It came with three massive fist sized dumplings and a ton of chewy rice cakes. The dumplings were slightly difficult to eat due to their size, but the skin was relatively thin (my favourite). Though there wasn't much flavour, the dumplings paired really well with the soy sauce vinegar combo. I really enjoyed the soy sauce with the vinegar, actually!

Although the soup seemed to be relatively light and homemade, I suspect it's doused with MSG. Having drank every last sip, I went home that night parched as a desert. I was so thirsty! Had to drink two massive mugs of water to quench my thirst.

My friend noticed that the restaurant had added a new dish to the menu - dolsot bibimbap! She ended up ordering the beef option. It came in a sizzling hot stone bowl, but unfortunately, the sizzle died soon afterwards without much formation of a crust. The bibimbap came loaded with lots of vegetables and beef, and was topped with a shining fried egg.

Both portions were massive - each of us were unable to finish our individual meals! The kimchi was also very delicious... We ended up asking for a refill! It's a younger kimchi than what most would expect, and it's therefore sweeter. That said, the spice kick is still relatively strong! There's plentiful of garlic... In fact, I woke up the next day with crazy garlicky breath. I didn't realize that I had consumed so much of the garlic!

The service, however, was lacking. It wasn't very attentive at all. Oftentimes, we had to chase them down for more tea or a request. That said, it may be due to the language barrier... One of the two waitresses appeared to understand minimal English. Not a surprise, given that all the restaurant diners were Korean.

Would definitely come again for the Shabu Shabu!"}
{"text":"My family went to this restaurant for lunch, and we thoroughly enjoyed it. The owner makes the kimchi herself, and the noodles for the shabu shabu are also made on the day of. As a Korean family, we found that the taste is authentic, and quite delicious. I recommend it, especially if you like to share food rather than just eat your own plate."}
{"text":"I had no idea what's to expect from this place but it pleasantly surprised me! We were in the mood for hotpot but weren't feeling the Little Sheep soup base or Morals Village, so we decided to give this place a try.

The broth is clear, subtle but very flavourful! We ordered the hotpot set for 3 people (we were a party of 4 people) and it was a sufficient amount of food. The set came with fresh veggies, frozen seafood and sliced beef. To be honest, the hotpot portion of the meal was just whatever... I'd recommend the Thai hotpot at I Love Pho 2 over this if you want a-la-carte hotpot. The standout part of the meal was actually the part when the waitress mixed rice into the leftover soup broth to make congee. The congee had flavours of seaweed and was so delicious that I'm still thinking of it now! 

They served a homemade kimchi which had a lot of garlic. I didn't like this... As it gave me garlic breath until the next day despite numerous brushing.

Overall, I'd recommend it especially if you've never tried it before!"}
{"text":"A small authentic Korean restaurant. The server were very nice and explained every dish in detail. This is a great place for some authentic Korean food. Just a note that they did not honour the yelp coupon which was very surprising as it has never happened to us before. All in all a good and different experience."}
{"text":"A nice place for good comfort food. You won't have the most delicious Korean food you've ever had by any stretch, but the food is decently tasty, ambiance is very clean and modern, good amount of seating so it's fine for groups and families, and the soup options are hearty, comforting and delicious. 

Located in the plaza directly beside/south of the Newin Centre (southeast of Hurontario and Dundas), we visited on a Friday evening around 7:00 PM and it was quite busy! Full of families and couples, and there's lots of parking. There isn't as much variety to the menu compared to, say, Owl of Minerva, but there's a decent amount to choose from. We ordered: a) the Bulgogi Set Meal, which came with a good amount of soup, and a smaller portion of beef + white rice, and b) the Dumpling Soup, which was full of dumplings and rice cakes. We actually really enjoyed the soup that came with the Bulgogi Set Meal. The set was the perfect portion size, and the broth was spicy and flavourful. The Dumpling Soup was fine - the dumplings were the size of 2 golf balls, and they stuffed it with a lot of meat, but as Stephanie S. mentioned, the dumpling wrapper was really flimsy and the meat was spilling out. Broth flavour was tasty - not the best, but still good!

Overall, a good place for a nice, casual meal - the soup options are great for these cold winter months! For two people, with tax and tip, we paid around $30.00."}
{"text":"This is an authentic Korean noodle shabu shabu restaurant. You know it's authentic when it's all Korean customers and the servers barely speak English. Thank God the menu is full of pictures so you can just let your fingers point and do the ordering. 

I'm impressed that there's such a modern and trendy restaurant hidden in a plaza by 5 and 10. Very clean and has a good vibe to it. Reminds me of the newly renovated Pho Do Thi. If you're a regular there then you'll know what I'm talking about. 

This place is garlic heaven. Generous amounts of garlic is used for most menu items. It'll leave your mouth vampire resistant for the night!

The soups are yummy. The kalguksu is a bit peppery but gives your Seoul a warm hug on a cold day(hehe hope you get that). I'm sure everything is made in house and without msg but I couldn't really confirm that with the language barrier. 

Noodles. Soft and chewy. 110% my fav

Bosam was tender and juicy. It comes with a bucket of lettuce and three condiments that adds so much flavor to the whole package. Really enjoyable if you like eating with your hands. 

This place makes the biggest dumplings. It really takes the dumpling game to a whole new level. This is also packed with garlic fyi. 

This be my joint besides Buk Chang Soon Tofu that's down the street."}
{"text":"It tastes very similar to what I had in Korea. The quality of the ingredients is there. I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times now and still love it!

Miss Korean shabu shabu all the time so it's nice there's one down the street. Disclaimer... I've never ordered anything else but shabu shabu here. 

The soup, veggies, meat is always fresh and good portions. For 3 adults and my nephew we ordered 2 dinners and a plate of dumplings and it was way more than enough. Definitely different from chinese hot pot but my dad was able to appreciate the flavors here. 

The noodles and porridge at the end is always a nice finish. 

Sauces were great and the chilis on the table was a great kick. 

The service is friendly but not attentive enough, had to flag down for everything. 

They were really nice to my nephew and gave him a lollipop."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem located in an unexpected plaza in Mississauga!

We ordered their MD shabu shabu set for two and were pleasantly surprised with the entire experience from start to finish. 

The food, along with the side dishes which included the salad and kimchi, were served promptly. The salad was excellent; the greens were fresh and the dressing was creamy with a touch of balsamic vinegar. What surprised us the most was the kimchi which was served in a mini clay pot!

Since it was our first time seeing kimchi served this way, we were excited to try it. The kimchi was probably the best we've ever had.  It was more on the sweeter side and wasn't overly spicy. Every bite of the kimchi was crunchy and flavourful.  The clay pot was rather large and we managed to finish it all, it was THAT good!

The ingredients that were part of the set included an assortment of greens, thin slices of beef, two varieties of fungus and two tofu pockets filled with ground pork and cabbage - which was our favourite. The noodles were of the chewy kind, which needed to be cooked longer. The broth was super flavourful and meaty.  There were two condiments; one was sweet and sour, and the other was sesame based.  The beef complimented these sauces well.

After we finished the raw ingredients, we were served cooked rice to make congee with the residual broth. It was a nice end to the meal and it was a very resourceful dining approach.

The portion sizes fell short of our expectations for the price; there were plenty of vegetables compared to the proteins, namely the two tofu pockets. Also, the vegetables could have been more fresh as they showed signs of slight browning. As the residual broth was concentrated, the congee was saltier than we would have preferred. 

This restaurant is a great option for those seeking solace from the cold winter weather. We would greatly recommend this place for those looking for a different Korean dining experience in Mississauga!"}
{"text":"Reservations were made and off we went to  experience MDNSS. It was fortunate that I knew the area well but our dining companions got lost trying to find the place.  Good luck to everyone who will be heading out to MDNSS for some eats. Just finding the place will be an adventure in itself.  Plenty of free parking so no worries. The Resto, on first appearance, looked small but it was clean and well staffed. No language barriers here either. Our orders:  Seafood Noodles for two, MD Special Shabu for two, one Steamed Mandu and two orders of the Bulgogi Combos. Four Adults and Four children. Let the gluttony begin. Lol. Seafood noodles were good. Not great but good. The ladies polished off every last bit of the Special. Their burps of satisfaction said it all. I enjoyed the Mandu and bulgogi combos. The bulgogi combo comes with a medium sized noodle soup.  The noodle were delicious. I also had the pleasure of finishing all of the children's leftovers. The service was great too. We never waited for anything. We asked and it was given. Kudos to the service ladies!!!  Ohhh I was so beached afterwards. Full and happy. Being that it was my first time at MSS I will award them with a Big Three Stars. We will see about the consistency cause I am sure that I will be back for more."}
{"text":"Food was solid. You can really tell everything was high quality ingredients.  It was kinda over priced and there wasnt enough meats. But the kim chi was very fresh. The fish cake was insane. Price was very nicely renovated."}
{"text":"The dumplings were big and tasty.  The noodles were chewy and good portions.  The bosam was juicy and melt in your mouth.

Service was good and they came around often to refill tea and kimchi too.  A side note that everything pretty much involved garlic, no complaints from me though."}
{"text":"Really tasteful soup! The home made dumplings are a must ! They are very unique and crazy good"}
{"text":"One of the best places in Mississauga for comforting Korean food! 

My favorites are the mandu (large pork dumplings), shabushabu (korean hot pot), kalguksu (soup noodles) and the best part, the bossam (steamed pork belly lettuce wraps). 

The shabu shabu comes with vegetables and beef, and they make a delicious comforting seaweed and egg vegetable congee from the broth after. There is a vinegar sauce and a peanut sauce that comes with it. The pork noodles have a great chewy texture and a delicious broth. The bossam comes with green onion and garlic around the pork belly, which you have to put in your lettuce wrap once it cooks a bit. There are 2 sauces, one fishy salty one, and one thicker spicy soybean paste sauce. You can put either one. The kimchi is homemade and garlicky, but not too spicy. 

The dishes are great for sharing, everything is homemade, and the food is relatively clean, wholesome, and healthy. We come 3-4 times a month, have brought a few of our friends and family, and we'll keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Tip:  If possible, enter from the back, off King St.  If you're going West on Dundas, this place is quite tricky to enter.

I thought this place was as the 3*s indicate, a-ok.

Initially, I thought this was located in the ghetto food court, a.k.a. Newin Centre, but it's actually in a L-shaped plaza with a mix of Polish, Korean, & Latin American shops. 

I had the Kalguksuk and the noodles were nice and chewy.  Presentation wasn't the best as I had large and uneven slices of green onion in my soup.  Taste-wise, I liked the broth at the now defunct Etobicoke joint, Sikgaek.  I thought that broth had a better flavour.  

My mom really liked her Mandu in soup with rice cakes.  Although they were at least golf-ball sized, I've had much better mandu elsewhere.  The wrapping was sort of falling apart as soon as you took it out of the soup.  Broth was good though.

Initially had to physically flag down wait-staff to place our order, but after that, tea/kimchi was refilled without asking.

Food isn't the best, but certainly not the worst either.

Bonus?  There is plenty of parking!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner to try out their Korean shabu shabu. We got the seafood set. It was around 18.99 for a person and minimum order was two orders.  The soup base was really good. The set came with some beef, some seafood and a lot of vegetables. Portion of meat was very small and to add additional beef it was $6. The set also came with noodles and rice to be added at the end. The rice is mixed into the soup and eaten like congee. 

The service was excellent. The food was ok. If you love vegetables then it's a good place to check out. I don't feel like it's as worth it for so little meat. But if you eat everything. It's filling. 

P.s. The design of the restaurant is really nice and there's unlimited kimchi!"}
{"text":"This place finally opened in Mississauga, and after all this time i finally had the chance to come pay a visit. Came on a weekday after work for dinner with my mom. It was quiet, so we got seated very quickly. And its alwys a plus for my mom that they serve hot tea!

Decided to try their popular dumplings and ordered two set dinners. First of all, their kimchi was BOMB! Soooo good. Everyone makes their kimchi differently, and I dont like kimchi thats on the sour end. But their kimchi was perfectly how i like it! Both set dinner came with the beef soup noodle. They were good. A little unimpressed with the dumplings as i heard so many good thing about them. But they sure are huge! Lol so ofc i couldnt finish and had to pack it for lunch tmr. Overall, i would come back again. 

Coming for the shabushabu next time!!!"}
{"text":"Food was really good. Shared the bibimbap, kulguksu, and the soup dumplings with rice cake and the bossam

Everything was really good, but the dumplings. They were lacking versus all the other orders, but overall it was a really good experience. Their kim chi is 5"}
{"text":"I got the red pork combo and my wife got the bulgogi combo. Both were decent. The red pork is super spicy by the way  so beware before adding more sauce. The noodle soup it comes with tastes kind of like msg but it was good. The portions were huge too. My big complaint though is the pork came out at room temperature. I also had some stomach trouble after which I'm not sure was related or not but either way I think it should be served hot. Service is a bit frantic. The inside is warm and comfy."}
