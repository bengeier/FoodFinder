{"text":"Taco Tonto's is a fun place in a fun part of Kent.  Good food, fast service, excellent prices.    Mmmmm..."}
{"text":"Best tacos in town! Try the two layer."}
{"text":"Taco Tantos has been a long standing comfort food of mine. After a stressful work day, a massive cheesy burrito can hit the spot! There are classic menu items and unique daily specials that take a whole new twist on what you expect in a burrito. Some are even perhaps on the \"healthier\" side. I particularly love the Ratatouillerito, which is served only on Wednesdays. Fridays offer Fish or Shrimp for your burrito/tacos.   Dining in has three options...1) inside Taco Tantos, 2) The Zephyr Patio (a Summertime must!) 3) or now the Venice (where great priced margaritas can be found!). I am so happy to see this company expand in Kent as well as the Lakewood location. The large quantity and quality of food comes for a price that can't be beat. Chances are you may be coming home with leftovers you will be eager to eat the moment you are hungry again!"}
{"text":"Sweet potato burrito #1. Freshest food.   It can get cramped pretty fast in there and its kind of a bummer that the chips aren't included or at least higher quality since you're paying for them, but the food is still terrific and they have a good beer selection."}
{"text":"Coming from CA a Mecca of delicious food of all sorts, my family was excited to find this twist/variation of the Mexican food we know and love. Growing up with awesome food kind of spoils us and it is hard to find somewhere that is more than ok. The food here is cooked to order, fresh and consistently great. They have chicken steak and even a sweet potato burrito. Domestic and imports, but they also carry a great assortment of craft beers. Try this hole in the wall you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great place. They try to use as much local produce as possible. Burritos are cooked to perfection with amazing house made salsas. Soon to have good beer too. Must try"}
{"text":"Really bad food and a bad environment. Also extremely expensive. Their tacos are mushy and their burritos really hold no flavor. Meat seems like it's canned and heated in a microwave.   NO"}
{"text":"Amazing local restaurant that is getting better and better.  Great variety, great ingredients, nice beer selection.  I love the new special burritos each night and my kids like ordering burritos that are exactly the way they want and like.  The prices have gone up a bit in the past year, but it's still well worth it.  It's good food made fast."}
{"text":"To start, the people who gave this place bad reviews are the worst and obviously know nothing about delish mexican food.  When visiting Cleveland, a trip to taco tontos is a must for this guy.  My go to move is the beef taco salad.  Marcus goes with chicken and his mind is equally blown.  He's basically sampled it all and its all thumbs up for him.  Great beer list and the margaritas are killer (real talk, they're strong)    The only thing that could make the place better would be a patio, we heard a rumors of one coming soon... hmmm..."}
{"text":"I love this place - the music, the ambiance, and of course the food! Our family loves it, it's usually the first place we take relatives who are visiting the area."}
{"text":"I love Taco Tontos in Lakewood and had no idea there were any more of them. The set up here is different, you have to order at the counter, the menu is smaller, but the basics are the same.  It was really busy tonight so I understand some issues. My order was wrong, one of my burritos was omitted. It took over forty minutes to get my food, there were 7 of us. So, after 40 minutes, one of us didn't have dinner.   The cook had to take back all 4 of the burritos I did get to cut them open because she couldn't tell me which was which kind; she had mislabeled them.  I also ordered nachos. Nachos here means a tray of tortillas with cheese and no other toppings which are put into the oven until they are hopelessly burnt. If you tell the cook they are burnt, she'll argue. They were so burnt, you couldn't even remove the top layer and eat the chips underneath as the burnt flavor went all the way through.  There should be no other Taco Tontos because this one sucks. I won't even go into the other problems as anyone reading this should get the idea. This place made us all long for Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Small place with BIG Taste Taco Tontos is 77% (survey says) of Kent population's favorite place to eat. The food is great, the prices inexpensive, the ingredients fresh, the service quick, and the staff sexy.   They have a pretty big selection for a small place and the rotating specials are also good. The regular sized burritos do it for me, but the large ones are good for bigger appetites! Beef burritos with corn salsa are yummy. The great staff always spice em up if you tell them. I also get 2 different tacos for about $5.  The potato burrito is also excellent.   You can't order from the Zephyr (side) window anymore, but you can call ahead and walk there. Don't be lazy! During good weather, you can get your food and sit on the next door patio with a beer/cocktail or walk down to the park (with a flask!)."}
{"text":"This is the best place to eat in Kent.  I have to confess to eating an el-biggo beef burrito at least once a week for the past year.  The only thing that I would complain about is the 5.00 credit card minimum."}
{"text":"Amazing food! A hidden gem in Kent!"}
{"text":"Taco Tonto's is one of our favorite places in Kent to eat for lunch. Tacos are amazing. Usually stuffed to the brim with your choice of veg, meats, and toppings. Kevin is great with customers and always friendly. The problem is when Kevin is not working, the food and customer service goes way down hill. I have been here multiple times when he's not there ... and the food is mediocre and the customer service is lackluster. I would give this place five stars if it wasn't for these concerns."}
{"text":"Good food and good prices. The menu is easy to work with and there are always interesting specials. Usually pretty quick and easy, great for a lunch. The atmosphere is pretty good too, and it doesn't seem to be overly busy usually. I'd say go for it..."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our visit. The soft tacos are huge-burrito size - and very cheaply priced. My spouse said the chicken in her taco was very tender and flavorful. I had the sweet potato and black bean taco - delicious. Cool atmosphere, friendly staff."}
{"text":"Wow. This place beats chipotle any day. Just know that a large burrito is huge!!"}
{"text":"Really incredible food. Fresh veggies and eclectic options that change regularly. Lots of choices for vegetarians and vegans. You're crazy to stand in the long Chipotle line when this place is so close and so delicious!"}
{"text":"Taco Tonto's is delicious.  It is my favorite place to eat in Kent.  I've only ordered the burritos, and the sweet potato burrito is the way to go.  They have the greatest home made hot and mild sauce. It's so good I could drink it straight from the bottle.  You can buy the sauce...only $2.50 for 16 ounces! Great food and great prices!"}
{"text":"Excellent place. Small dining area, but take out is the way to go anyway. Love the Sting Rae burrito."}
{"text":"YUM!!! I love the art on the walls, it's usually made by Kent State students. The tostadas and burritos are awesome! Try this place instead of Chipotle one day. You'll love it."}
{"text":"Baked burritos! The new owners are buying their meat locally now! Awesome vibe I've been going to this place for years."}
{"text":"I confess that I will be biased, having lived in San Diego for 7 years, always less than a block from a real Mexi-Cali style restaurant, with authentic Mexican flavor (and authentic Mexicans!).  Taco Tonto's is good, but it's not very authentic.  It drives me crazy that the larger burrito is called \"El Biggo.\"  Or that the taco salad-y thing I ordered came served on stale, round, grocery-store-style tortilla chips, and not on a crispy corn tortilla.  But those gripes aside, the other food I've tried is decent (especially the chicken taco), the prices are reasonable, and the atmosphere is friendly.  Just be prepared to wait forever for your food to be ready - no rushing here.    When the weather's good, it's even more enjoyable to buy a drink at Zephyr, sit on their patio, and enjoy your tacos there via the pickup window."}
{"text":"I used to be a big fan but, sadly, in recent months this place has started to slip. First, the service I received went from friendly and efficient, to indifferent and sometimes bordering rude. Then the food quality began to suffer; usually this was the result of undercooking...But the last straw was the uncharacteristically greasy burrito combined with the flavor of burnt garlic I had today. Think I might go down the road for a few months before trying Taco Tonto's again."}
{"text":"Taco Tonto's in my opinion is by far and away the best restaurant in the city of Kent. Not only are the standard menu items extremely delicious, the innovative daily specials always push my taste bud's ability to register the sensation of deliciousness to limits I never thought possible. Some people may find the \"non traditional\" dining area a bit cramped, I simply find it unique and endearing. The entire restaurant oozes locally owned charm. Nowhere is this reflected more than in the food itself. Every single ingredient that can be sourced locally is, and my goodness does that show up in the mouthwatering flavors you experience in each delectable bite. In closing if you are the type who prefers a more pretentious dining experience with a wait staff I suggest ordering to-go and eating at home where you can pretend your cat is your moody waiter. If you are more in tune with the modern eatery and enjoy an intimate setting that exudes eccentric charisma then eat in. Either path will lead you and your mouth into a world of scrumptious bliss you won't soon forget!"}
{"text":"I love cheaper Mexican food, and Taco Tonto's is a great place to stop for a burrito.  The number one reason to go here is to grab some Mexican food while drinking at the Zephyr pub (they share a patio).    While the food is delicious and made with fresh ingredients, it's not quite as delicious in my opinion as Chipotle.  I feel like there are not as many choices when it comes to salsas (or, if you want any kind of salsa, they charge extra for it).  All of the ingredients for each burrito are specific, and you have to customize instead of building from scratch.    That said, it's still rather good.  Their baked burritos are crispy on the outside, with cheesy gooey-ness on the inside."}
{"text":"Is the food delicious? Without a doubt. Is it worth the price, wait, and not always courteous staff? Ehh, not so sure.   I've been going to Taco Tanto's ever since I started at KSU. Since then I've learned a thing or two about the place. When you walk in, you're greeted by bright colors and enticing smells. There is sometimes very loud hipster music playing in the stereo. Not your usual restaurant soundtrack. Limited amount of tables in the place, and it can definitely be crowded easily.   I guess my gripes with the place mostly have to do with the staff. They're a bunch of hipster, ride bikes everywhere and transcend everything, college students who have this holier than thou impression about them. I've waited nearly 20 minutes for my food at one point and once in a while there's something wrong with the order.   Pros about the place - local art adorns the wall, and they have the best homemade hot sauce in Portage County.   I guess if you can make it past the slightly arrogant workers, Taco Tanto's is a great place to go for lunch...if you're not on a schedule."}
{"text":"On Thursday my hubby picked up a to go order.  We've had decent food in the past and we had a craving.  Plus it was too hot to cook.  I had a sweet potato and black bean bowl and he had the cheeseburger bowl.  Both were super spicey so much so we had to add sugar.  A few bites into mine I noticed the spinach that they added for me was sour and turning.  I pushed that all aside and took 1 more bite... Low and behold a HUGE hair was in my food.  Hubby's bowl tastes like someone just poured a bunch of cheap taco seasoning on the beef.  Needless to say we threw both bowls out.  We've been in the area 17 years and ate here several times but I think we are done.  El Camp and Fresco will be taking care of the cravings from now on."}
{"text":"This place has a nice charm to it. The staff is all really welcoming and accomodating. The food we got was pretty good. I didn't love their guacamole. The food all seems very fresh, which is why I was drawn to the place, but their wasn't a ton of flavor in my burrito. I was kind of disappointed that I had to add salsa and sauce to make it more enjoyable. I'm going to have to try this place again to get a better read since so many people love it."}
{"text":"I've been here once. Discovered it via Yelp and decided to check it out. I was not disappointed. The tacos were MASSIVE! I move had tacos all over the country, and these were the biggest. Stuffed to the brim with whatever u want.... Even sweet potatoes. They were absolutely delicious. I got 3 steak tacos and a sweet potato taco. I was full after 2. They also have a variety of excellent hot sauces.  I am definitely going back for more."}
{"text":"Taco Tonto's is one of my favorite places to eat.  This was my first visit to the Kent location, but I've been to the Lakewood place several times.  Their food is always fresh and enormous.  You really have to customize your order to get the most out of their flavors.  I loved the jerk chicken special with sweet potatoes, black beans, and fruit salsa."}
{"text":"Honestly, I don't give 'excellent' or whatever the top rating is for much of anything, food, books, music or otherwise because perfection is rather impossible, right?  But...for a taco joint that doesn't try to \"be Mexican,\" meaning it just serves up some killer flavors in a taco shell (soft or corn, or both) for a really fair, if not cheap price, I don't know what they could do to make it better.  Fish tacos on Friday; wicked pork tacos; Brussels Sprout taco special ?! Serious creativity, some serious food.  Were I to give Taco Tonto's fewer stars, it would be because the place seats so few folks, but personally, as an ex-cook myself, that's pretty smart thinking.  House is always full, flow of customers is self-moderated, and you can always go next door to the patio and order TT from their window.  If you visit Kent (or the other TT town) and do not eat one of these tacos, you will not have lived a full (pun intended) life."}
{"text":"Maybe I just caught them on a bad day...but I was really disappointed with my meal there.  I ordered two soft tacos...first one was the combo which contained ground beef and pinto beans and the second one was the chicken and sour cream.  Both came with lettuce, tomato and shredded cheese.  First of all, the soft taco shells were cold and limp...i would have figured they would have either heated them up or possibly grilled them...so that was kind of startling on the first bites.  Secondly, (besides the sour cream on the chicken taco) they were no sauces of any kind leading to a rather bland taste to both tacos.  There was plenty of filling in each, so being full was not the issue...I simply felt that the meal lacked any flavor depth, which led me to this poor review."}
{"text":"I kinda miss Taco Tontos. Only true foodies know this place, while the \"sheep\" go to Chipotle up the street."}
{"text":"Gosh- have been going here for like , ages! Has not changed a bit and since it is a spectacular day outside , we decided tacos and Kent is a good idea. The food here is always fresh, the place is adorable and has such a fun vibe. Love it here. Prices are reasonable and on par with other enormous burritos and tacos. The thing here is that the portions are awesome and huge and it's so much better than elsewhere. Overall, place is super small inside but they do have outdoor seating as well and it's worth it in the summer. Staff is friendly and filled with college kids. It's just fun and when done- be happy that you went ."}
{"text":"This is my first time. I'm liking it so far. Looks like they have some unusual tastes on the menu. I look forward to trying much more. People are pretty nice so far also.."}
{"text":"Driving from our home in California, we had some really good Mexican food in Grand Junction, CO and Indianapolis. After reading the reviews, we were ready for some tasty Mexican at Taco Tonto's...wrong! I ordered a chicken burrito. Lots of plain, unseasoned chicken but not much of anything else. My first time in memory that I could not finish a burrito. Just no Mexican taste. My wife's tostada came with the cheese and meat on the tortilla but nothing else. We found out as we left that they had forgotten to put the lettuce, tomato, etc. on the top. Our friend's potato burrito was bland and not much more than a tortilla stuffed with potato.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"THIS my friends is what a taco and burrito shop should be!  I will go here whenever I have a craving for Mexican.  It kicks Chipotle and other chains to the curb. Firstly, I love the layout.  It's a little on the small side, but I like that.  It feels a little more personal so that's a plus in my book.   They have a lot of personal touches, from the decor, to the little station with complementary water as well as their fantastic hot and mild sauces.  The wait time isn't bad at all.  It takes about 4 minutes for two burritos.  My burrito of choices would be an \"el biggo\" chicken burrito with sweet potatoes....SWEET POTATOES. Need I say more?  The price is about the same as Chipotle which is awesome seeing as how local eateries tend to be a little more expensive.    Overall, this is a great place.  I'm not surprised that they have stuck around as long as they have.  If you are in the Kent area and need lunch or dinner, go here."}
{"text":"great place. come here when you are fucking hungry. Like, fucking hungry, not just hungry. this shit is huge... great food. Order the salsa and chips. It's worth a drive from Cleveland or Canton."}
{"text":"Best burrito of my life! love the different daily specials! One time they had a BLT burrito with a ton of other stuff in it. I got that and it was the best burrito I've ever had! Love coming here! If you're in the mood for an amazing burrito this is the place!!"}
{"text":"Love the Tonto's!  Get a Corizo borito with potato and take it home for morning.  When you get up make some coffee and slice it up into 1 inch slices and fry it with your eggs! OMG!!!  Breakfast has never been the same!  We have one there and take one home for Saturday morning.  Love it and great beer too while you wait or eat in?  They always have a great IPA on tap."}
{"text":"The food here is different--where else can you get sprouts in a burrito? How about one filled with sweet potato? Plus they bake the burritos and the tortilla gets firm and a little crispy, which is both both delicious and a lot easier to manage for consumption (floppy=messy). Chipotle's is a fine place to eat, if a little ho-hum (Qdoba was always better), but TT's is the obvious choice.  The hot sauces are tasty, but not really hot. The \"hot\" is only slightly spicier than the \"mild.\" Really nothing to fear here for those weak on the heat.  The interior has a nice atmosphere, and I especially appreciate the eclectic music selection of one of the employee's iPods on random (dude's got good taste). I actually just sat in here once and spaced out for a good while as I digested the food. I find the place relaxing, maybe because it reminds me of Seattle, where I'm from.  Make sure to note that the pick up spot is different from the order spot (go toward the front door and hang a right)."}
{"text":"Over-priced/hyped, Americanized Mexican food that caters to the college crowd. If you never had real Mexican food you might not mind it. If you have, you will more than likely be disappointed."}
{"text":"Absolutely my favorite eatery in Kent. The owners continue to be inventive with the menu yet you can always get a delicious standard (mine is the sweet potato/back bean burrito).  I love that they locally source ingredients whenever possible.  Whenever guests are in from out of town,  Taco Tontos and Ray's are always where we go. These two restaurants are Kent treasures. Thank you to all of the staff for the good energy you put into the food and for the vibe you create in the restaurant."}
{"text":"The sweet potato burrito changed my life.  No joke.  Prior to dining at Taco Tanto's proper, I've been luck enough to enjoy their delicious guacamole next door at Zephyr.  I was blown away by their guac, which is incredibly fresh and flavorful; some of the best I've had.  yet for some crazy reason, I never ventured into the restaurant or tried their other foods.  How silly of me.  I could have been enjoying delicious sweet potato burritos for months!  I don't know how they make it (I think it might be magic) but somehow the sweet potato and black beans combine to create heaven.  I'm not exaggerating.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the restaurant is pretty tiny.  Yet during lunchtime on a Monday, it was also empty, so we had no concerns about snagging a table.  You order your food at the counter, and then they call your name when it's ready so you can pick it up.  Chances are your wait will be less than 5 minutes.  I love that they're very eco-friendly, too.  There are signs all over the place asking that you not waste food, napkins, utensils, etc.  Overall, the place has a really feel-good vibe.  You know you're supporting a local establishment that takes pride in serving you quality food, and cares about the environment.  What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"only had Taco Tontos a few times, but it's always been delicious. i like that they press their burritos after they put everything inside of them, unlike Chipotle. They have THE best guacamole ever :D"}
{"text":"Every time I come here I am super depressed...but as soon as I walk in the door it is as if happiness washes over my body. The food makes me want to live for ever. If I had the lazarus pit from season 3&4 from Arrow that made you live forever, I would probably just come here a lot. It's is as if God himself is making the burrito and the burrito is Christ himself. When I take the first bite I cry. I cry because a wave of emotions crashes down upon me with the force of 1000 waves. And I am happy. I AM GOD. so all in all the food is pretty epic af."}
{"text":"Fun and funky taco spot on a quaint brick road near Kent State. Street parking can be tight and the steep steps up to the door preclude those with mobility issues from eating in. Huge, meaty tacos are worth it, even with most toppings being upcharged. Skip the chips and get another main dish. Sad I couldn't get queso - they'd just run out."}
{"text":"This place has a weird setup.  I get that it is college town & this place SCREAMS COLLEGE, but personally, as a first time visitor, I was a bit confused.  You have to walk around  wall to place your order.  The joint is TINY!  Not many tables & chairs, so if you're lookin' to dine in...beware.  I might suggest you get it to go.  I was there at \"lunch\" hour & it was packed w/ people & dirty tables.  ON the flip of that, as soon as it cleared out a bit, the staff was out there & cleaning it up!  The employees were super nice.  Service was quick.  The food was eh.  The portions were huge.  I am typically not an a la carte kind of chick, but I understand why they do that here.   My burrito bowl was a bit like a big mess of food I couldn't see under the huge pile of cheese.  I can't say that the food settled well. There are nice veg options & carnivore options.   Would I go back, probably, but I'd keep it simple & stick to a taco."}
{"text":"Nice change from chain restaurants.  I LOVE the sauce they hand out with the burritos.  It's very small with only a few tables so I prefer to get it carry out."}
{"text":"Excellent Grilled Burritos! Service is a tad slow but it is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Love Taco Tontos! It's one of those unique, hole-in-the-wall places you picture when you think of a college town. Lots of color, lots of art - and reliably great food. We're partial to the burritos and tostadas, and their specials of the day are always a fun way to try something new. You get a giant portion for the price, you can tell that everything is freshly made in house, and I've never left unsatisfied.   The only reason I didn't rate it five stars is that the place is very small, so sometimes I feel rushed to eat and leave so there's space for new customers. But it's almost part of the charm - Taco Tontos is in an old building, with uneven stone steps leading inside (Note: not wheelchair-accessible), and you feel a lot of that character throughout your experience here."}
{"text":"Seriously, some of the best burritos around. No necessarily Mexican.. but certainly great wraps and fun tex-mex. The homemade salsas and chips are to die for. Thus place is even better when it's late at night... LONG LIVE TACO TONTO'S!!"}
{"text":"In the area for the first time to visit Kent State. Saw the good reviews so we thought we would give it a try. I had the steak burrito with habanero sauce. This may have the best burrito I have ever had!  The meat was so tender and flavorful. Loved the crunchy shell since they are baked. The only negative (which really isn't a negative) is the the habanero sauce was rated as a 4 pepper on its heat scale. I'd maybe give it a 2.5 for heat. But it definitely had good flavor. I am hoping that my daughter decides to go to school here or I may never get back this way to eat here again."}
{"text":"The hard shell tacos are huge - I got two, but really one and a side of guac or salsa is all you need.  The chicken is really tasty, and the sweet potato doesn't sound like it's gonna be good, but it is, trust me.  Pretty solid guacamole and chips.  Super fast service for takeout.  This place is definitely a highlight of the Kent, Ohio dining scene!"}
{"text":"Good food, good selection, good prices and great service. Dining area is small, but you can order from the Zephyr Pub's patio next door. And of course, take out!"}
{"text":"Hmm. We had a real ho-hum experience and I am still bummed *insert sad smiley*. Based off of the menu and reviews maybe my expectations were set too high, but our meal was far from stellar.   That being said, to be fair we will probably return due to their convenient location to our customers, and my husband's unnatural burrito obsession lately. Second chances - I am full of them.  A few days ago was our first time here and we ordered a sweet potato burrito and added chipotle sauce. The second burrito we ordered was a rice,  bean and cheese burrito to which we added habanero sauce. I am so glad we added the sauces because on their own these burritos would have been seriously lackluster. Very underseasoned and plain. My husband added additonal hot salsa to his bean/rice one, and add that point started to enjoy his meal.   'We' also ordered a side of guac and chips. OK so maybe I am the only one out of us two that likes avocado so technically these were mine.. But anyways, the guacamole tasted like an identical twin to the guac I make at home. The likeness to 'mine' is cray cray and thus of course I lurved it.  Way to go on the guacamole, guys!"}
{"text":"Awesome burritos. Makes me feel sad for chipotle fans that just don't know."}
{"text":"Instead of visiting a chain burrito palce, enjoy a delicious burrito at Taco Tanto's.  Add their guacamole or delicious, thick hot & medium sauces.  Then, branch out and try some of their other menu items.  It's so good, you'll soon be returning to buy one of their Taco Tanto's t-shirts, which are for sale at the restaurant."}
{"text":"My favorite lunch spot in Kent. Fresh ingredients, delicious combinations. Best chicken burrito I've ever had. I love the home made sauces, the hot sauce is my fav. Had a steak tostada, it was excellent."}
{"text":"Taco tantos!!! I've been going to this place for about eight years now. The burritos are made differently than at chipotle (which I also love), they are warm and are made in an oven and have a completely different taste. They have a good collection of hot sauces that should cater to every spice tolerance. Free chips with your burrito!  Location is perfect and surrounding all other bars and restaurants that are close to campus. Parking can sometimes be a nuisance. Lots of good memories attached to this place, will always frequent it, go try it out!!  PS don't go here expecting authentic Mexican, just consider it in it's own category (like chipotle)"}
{"text":"This is a great casual taco joint in the heart of Kent. We came with a group of 10 people after a show on a Sunday afternoon and were able to squeeze in at a table. The service was fast and casual, and the food was decent but not amazing. I ordered a steak burrito but what I got much more closely resembled carnitas (it was still delicious). The sun was streaming into the restaurant making it quite hot, and someone kept changing the volume on the radio so the music varied between nearly inaudible and eardrum blistering.   Street parking is difficult to find but theoretically convenient if you can snag a spot."}
{"text":"The best burritos you could ask for. By far my favorite place to eat in Kent. They are served hot and with the cheese melted thanks to the toasting. The place is small and a bit slow but well worth the wait."}
{"text":"I discovered this oasis in the desert of poop my senior year of high school and I always make sure to come here at least two or three times whenever I'm home. The food is great and the staff always have a smile on their face. This time around I got the chorizo burrito with queso cheese and bacon. It was like looking into the face of God and seeing him smile back and say he is proud. So you could say it was decent."}
{"text":"Love this place! The burritos are huge and comes out hot. My favorite is the sweet potato burrito. The staff is friendly and I would definitely come here over Chipotle any day."}
{"text":"Holy crapoly! Best burrito EVER! Get the hot sauce. I SAID GET THE DANG HOT SAUCE ON YOUR BURRITO! I'm not kidding. If I lived in Kent, I'd go to this place every day, be 500 pounds, and broke."}
{"text":"While in town, I was really happy to have something healthy and pleasantly simple yet tasty. I had the sweet potato bowl, and the coriander compliments the sweet potato nicely. I added pico de gallo which I would definitely recommend since it gave some crunch and freshness from the onions and tomato. The portion size was really large - fine with me, I'll save half for tomorrow! A little extra cheese for me. Pricing is very good too, with the pico, mine was $7.   I have some food allergens too, and the person helping us was very knowledgeable and thoughtful to help me. Really nice staff who seemed to enjoy working there.   I would definitely come back again next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Went to taco tontos yesterday with my boyfriend. We were excited to try the food, especially after reading great reviews on yelp. We ordered chips and queso, but were sad to find it was cheap bagged nacho chips and what seemed to be a velveeta queso. My boyfriend was let down by a left hand sign hanging, but they did not actually sell left hand. I ordered a steak tostado, which was subpar. It lacked flavor and seasoning, but not inedible. My boyfriend ordered the sweet potato and black bean burrito (being adventurous after reading rave reviews about it). The burrito was filled with easily two whole sweet potatoes with a handful of black beans, lettuce, and a sprinkle of cheese. He, who is usually a garbage disposal, would not eat it. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"As the legendary Emeril says, BAM! That is the delight that comes with eating at Taco Tantos. A nice riverfront view and brick streets adds to the nice aesthetic. We haven't gotten our food yet, but as they say, it's all about the journey. And the destination will be a delight."}
{"text":"Great food. Just watch the hair in the food. Got to the bottom of the burrito and guess what? Long black hair. Threw the rest out and left."}
{"text":"Amazing mexican food for a great price in Kent. Guacamole and queso here are unbeatable, some of the best I've had. The portions are crazy; you'll only need one taco as they're essentially just an \"open\" burrito. I've added the corn salsa and mango salsas before and they're both great. Always happy (and STUFFED) after a visit here!"}
{"text":"Cool LITTLE taco place in Kent. I got a chicken taco and a steak taco. Both were massive, and essentially the size of burritos. The chicken taco was pretty good, but the steak taco was meh. This is coming from someone who says the same thing about Chipotle chicken and steak. I think I just don't like cheap steak on tacos/burritos. Overall, cool little place and I would consider going back if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Let me start this review by saying this:   I used to love Taco Tontos. It was cheap, fast, near campus, and burritos are my one true love. Around Thanksgiving I came here and got some special turkey burrito. I got food poisoning and felt like I was going to die. I literally couldn't even think about this place for months without wanting to throw up. You know how when you sometimes get a little too lit at the bar and almost die from alcohol poisoning, and you just can't even drink tequila anymore (or whatever you were drinking that brought you to the brink of metaphorical death) and you have to just write off that particular liquor? This food experience was comparable.   Fast forward to the present, and I had a hot date with a bearded hipster who also happened to have a man bun. My uterus was in absolute awe of this fine majestic creature when he suggested this little spot, and I definitely wasn't thinking with my brain when I nonchalantly agreed.   So, I came to this establishment weary of impending doom and not wanting to get food poisoning again. Alas, I survived. HALLELUJER.   The food was still as bland as ever, but the beef was tender and flavorful. I also loaded the fuck out of my burrito with some pickles, because it sounded fuckin delicious and pickles are bangin.   TT also has an awesome assortment of craft beers and the vibe is usually pretty nice!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere, pricing, beer selection, and flavor of EVERYTHING is top-notch. I can't say enough about the customer service and all around quality."}
{"text":"After graduation my boyfriend took me to this taco place because I have been craving nachos and a taco for a while now. The place is pretty small but we were able to get a table. I really like that the nachos can be customized at a good price. We added beans, guacamole, pico de gallo, and chicken. It was perfect, flavorful, and really hit the spot. The taco unfortunately, did not. It was very bland. The rice didn't have any flavor and neither did the chicken. I added hot sauce to try and help but, it did little to help the overall taste. I would definitely go again for the nachos, and maybe add more extras to the taco for flavor. They were also much bigger tacos than I expected."}
{"text":"This place is just as good if not better than what I remember when I first visited about 6 years ago and they have expanded and opened another location on the West side of Cleveland to boot!!!!   Oh, if only they'd expand further and open a location in Phoenix then I'd be in heaven......a girl can dream can't she?  The item that caught my fancy when I first patronaged this little restaurant is the sweet potato burrito which comes black beans and with alfalfa sprouts.  \(o.O)/. Don't overthink it. Just try it and you will fall in love with :} Taco Tontos too!  As for seating granted the inside is tight. I think a max of 10-12 maybe can sit inside, but on days the shared patio is open there's plenty more seating."}
{"text":"This place embarrasses Chipotle and makes them want to run home to mommy.  If you thought a Chipotle burrito was as much as you could possibly eat in one setting, think again.  Taco Tontos - horrible Spanish grammar, by the way - makes burritos in two sizes: \"Regulata\" and \"El Biggo\".  They also have tacos in soft and corn shells, as well as salads for those who are still following the Atkins Diet for whatever reason.  You can get a variety of items on each dish for free on top of the ones that come with each menu item, such as pinto beans.  Others, such as chipotle peppers and guac, are extra.  I got an \"El Biggo\" Steak Burrito.  My friend warned me about how large they were, which in my twisted mind is a turn on.  The burrito must have been as wide as a Chipotle burrito but a good 2-4 inches longer.  It was also the same price as a Chipotle burrito, meaning you're getting a better deal buying an \"El Biggo\" burrito here instead of a burrito at Chipotle.  The burrito was orgasmic.  The quality of the ingredients was outstanding - nothing tasted pre-frozen.  The tortilla was placed on the grill after it was all done, giving it a more homemade taste.  It was admittedly quite filling, but I was able to gulp in in 3 minutes.  Woot.  After eating here, I now realize why Kent State students adore this place so much."}
{"text":"Best place to eat in Kent, hands down!! For the price and the food quality.. delicious tacos with fresh ingredients!!"}
{"text":"Great food! It takes a little but longer to get your order so I usually call ahead. Seating is limited but it is nice to sit outside during summer. Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Taco Tontos for YEARS. The food has stayed it's yummy self. The potato burrito was spot on. So glad they went back to the red potatoes. There was a time when they switched to Yukon Gold while I was in college and it just ruined everything.   Whenever I meet a high school student in California that is going to attend Kent State I always recommend Taco Tontos to them.  They don't understand, but they will. Always was a hip(ster) place to be!"}
{"text":"Yum. Who doesn't like this place? I went to KSU many years ago and it was the place to go. It still is, it's just around the corner now. Their portions are crazy big and the ingredients are always fresh. Their guacamole is pretty awesome! I usually get a burrito and only eat half. They have a good variety of menu items and everything is probably really good, based on the handful of items I've had.  I've never been there without having to wait but it is always worth it. Parking can be challenging but there's now a garage a few blocks up. We usually get our orders to go and eat outside somewhere. It's tiny inside and tables are never available anyway."}
{"text":"How I miss this place, the tacos and the hot sauce are some of my fav. It really is hard sometimes to find good mexican food that is seasoned. They do a great job on all levels.  I am happy they opened a second location, hope that trend continues."}
{"text":"Lots of variety at this \"tiny\" place next to Ray's.  When the Zephyr next door is open there is an option to grab a seat on the patio.   With just a few seats indoor it tough to plan on eating in unless it is slow.    Don't be in a rush.  Things move slower than at Chipotle and you'll be waiting in a weird little hallway to a side window  We always like the food.  Had a special today that was pulled pork with slaw that I had made into a small bowl to cut the carbs.  It was delicious but unfortunately wasn't terribly hot.   :-(. Another favorite is the sweet potato burrito."}
{"text":"Their place has great tacos, burritos and other Chipotle-style fare. But the food is WAY better than it's more famous rival. Be prepared to wait a while. Every order is hand made, one at a time. Well worth the wait for the end product you receive!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Made to order Mexican with eclectic food combos.  Plus, they serve beer. W00t!!  The only issue, size, it is a very small location, but worth the standing room only when busy."}
{"text":"AWESOME tacos and burritos. A lot of vegan/gluten free options! Try the sweet potato burrito or a taco on a corn tortilla!"}
{"text":"Incredible food and extremely generous portions. You won't find a better taco or burrito in the area. They offer daily specialty burritos which are as unique as they are delicious. If you are in Kent and want a burrito the size of your head, you have to stop by Taco Tontos. I actually get excited to eat their food. In addition, they have a really friendly staff who I always enjoy chatting with when I pick up my orders. Just go to Taco Tontos... You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"When this place first opened up, I remember the owner behind the stove. The food was so good and the service was excellent.   Today I ate there for the first time in 8 years. It wasn't as good as I remember. When we first got there the server was more interested in carrying on a conversation with a gentlemen customer. I was okay with it. I was in no hurry. After ordering we sat down. Arriving customers were greeted immediately.   The food was warm, not hot. The burrito was kind of bland, no taste to it at all. Others said their meat was cold. It was like they precooked the meat and when it was ordered threw it in a microwave to nuke it.   The cheese dip was really good. It was the only positive.  I don't understand the big wooden wall hiding the workers. And peaking around the corner to see what the heck."}
{"text":"I would give them 5 stars... But it's a little dirty-ish inside...(tables/floors/etc...)  The 1st time I was here, I did not care for it.  I think I just wasn't use to the flavors.  But now I have it down pat what I like, and it's SOOO good, I actually crave it once in awhile!  My love- a beef taco (hard shell), the thing is packed w/beef!!!  But it's not seasoned, which now I appreciate!  It has a great Beefy flavor!  Get a side of their hot sauce and a side of their queso cheese sauce.  Put a little bit if each on each bite... Omg, heaven!!!   The meats r from local farmers which I love that!  The guacamole is good too!     I had a bite of their pork and did not care for it, but I might try it again sometime...!"}
{"text":"After living in and around Kent for the past decade, I can say I've had my fair share of Taco Tontos. Typically, it has been a flavorful experience but other times they seem to really miss their mark. I normally stick to chicken burritos and add things like corn and sweet potato and it is pretty consistent. The music is eclectic and the ambiance has the small, tucked away, funky feel that I know and love from my favorite spots in Kent.   Last Thursday a group of my friends and I went here and grabbed a quick bite before heading out for drinks. I got \"Susan's Spicy Tandoori\" bowl. I appreciated the bowl or burrito option. When I received my bowl it was in a cardboard to-go container and hardly warm whatsoever. That may have been due to the fact that only one person seemed to be working (the counter/kitchen) and took little care in making sure food was warm enough. This is also indicative of how not fresh the food was.   Let me preface this review of the meal by saying I probably should have not ordered something Indian at a Mexican place. But, I thought why not try something new? What could go wrong? Firstly, the chicken tasted really old and dry. The sauce was a greenish/grey concoction that was not pleasing to see NOR to taste! The jalapeños were pickled and not fresh. The bed of rice beneath was alright. It was such poor flavor mixed with such overwhelming heat that in no way would I entertain finishing it. I pride myself in how much I enjoy spicy food and would never want to waste food for any reason, but I was sure I was not going to take one more bite of this travesty.   For the next 24 hours, my stomach hurt so bad that I had no appetite. Needless to say, TT did me dirty when I've always been a fan. I'm not sure if it's on a steady decline or if this was a one and done scenario. Either way, I don't think I'll be back in the near future."}
{"text":"Ordered lunch to pick up for my coworkers. Food was very good. Portions were huge. Everyone was happy.  Tip- Make sure you get your drinks and any side orders. Those were missing."}
{"text":"Good food, rude management. There are many other spots in town that will serve your burrito with a smile."}
{"text":"Been going here for years and love the food! Always potato, because life is miserable without potato burritos in it, but have tried bites of their other food and always wanted more. Go! Now! Why are you still reading this and not using both hands to hold a massive potato masterpiece!?!? Viva la Taco Tonto's!!!"}
{"text":"Ate there this afternoon with my husband....best Mexican food I have had in Ohio to date!   This was authentic and the flavors were fantastic.  Guy working there was super nice and very attentive!  This place was great!   Definitely a new favorite!"}
{"text":"I'm not really sure where I stand with this place. I was so excited to try it because I've heard so many great things about it, but when I finally went, I was disappointed.   I ordered a veggie bowl and was really impressed with their wide variety of choices. As a vegan, I was really happy with many vegan options - even vegan sour cream.   However, when it came to finally eating --- first, I had to wait ~30 minutes to get our food (I was with two other people). When we got our food, we grabbed the bag and left and I discovered that my bowl was not a bowl but a burrito! I don't want to feel like I have to check my food at a place to make sure it's correct. The food itself was pretty tasteless despite spending extra for guac and the vegan sour cream.   I don't know - maybe it was just a bad day for them. I'll try back again soon and hope for better."}
{"text":"Awesome place for a variety of unique and freshly made taco's. Perfect with a beer on the Zephyr patio!"}
{"text":"What's not to love about a taco joint with multiple vegan options?  My fiance and I happened to be in the Kent area and dropped by for a quick bite. We ordered the guac and chips (awesome), a potato burrito with chicken for him (good), and a ratatouillerito bowl for me (solid vegetable goodness served with a side of vegan sour cream). We enjoyed the laid back vibe and blaring Davie Bowie tunes.   If I'm ever back in the area I'll stop in again."}
{"text":"Every single time I visit the Kent area, you best believe I'm stopping at Taco Tonto's! They never seem to disappoint. My food always comes out hot, and super fresh. They weren't kidding when they say they have the best baked burrito. I love the huge windows in there, so when I sit at a table by the window it almost feel as if I'm eating outside. You won't regret visiting!"}
{"text":"First time here and wow I was blown away. Our meals came out hot and fresh like they should but what really got me was the portion size! I had more than enough for lunch the following day. Flavors were great and I will be back again. Quaint décor inside, not very large but fitting for a college eatery."}
{"text":"I really wish a little taqueria would open in town. Or two or three.  Something really hole in the wall, fresh, and inexpensive, to drive away the praise for Chipotle, Fresco whatever it's called, sparing perhaps this raved about, but ultimately disappointing staple, Taco Tonto's.  Ever have really great food truck, or mom and pop tacos? Burritos? Granted that's not what they're going for here, and every college town needs it's burrito place.  Try their featured burritos, they seem like they care about them. I had a tandoori chicken burrito that was good and interesting. The rest is sub par, and your money can be better spent."}
{"text":"Tacos Tanto's. Your unnecessarily large and cheesy burritos have been supporting my most primal craving for meat and cheese for about a year now. I always get an el biggo steak burrito with chipotle mayo. My only regret is that eating two of them in one sitting would be socially unacceptable. The daily specials they have are exciting, creative and delicious."}
{"text":"I was very excited after seeing all of the wonderful reviews on here, and so the family and I decided to check it out today. Biggest disappointment ever. We ordered 4 different items, all of which were subpar at best. The only thing Mexican about this place is the beer. So if you're looking for an authentic Mexican spot, keep moving. If, however, you would like some americanized hunk of overloaded garlic in a flour tortilla shell, this is your spot."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time and I was very excited but when I got there it was apparent that there were not  taco specials that had defining flavors but instead \"base\" tacos where you had a great selection of toppings however. I ordered the chicken tacos and I was so not impressed.... very bland one note food and the chicken was grainy and like mush in your mouth."}
{"text":"Downtown Kent you owe Taco Tanto's. You owe them for being there and being a destination. Anything that brings business into a downtown area not dominated by a megalopolis ultra store should be placed on the pedestal somewhere in the sky.   I head to northeast Ohio somewhat frequently, and this has become one of those places to go and try something different each time - and to look forward to what savory burst of satisfaction is about to hit you."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with some friends. I got the steak jumbo hardshell taco; my girlfriend got the \"regulata\" steak burrito.  Service was straightforward: go up to the counter and order. Pick a seat, wait for food, pick up at counter around the corner. The service was  quick and friendly.  Food was bland. For tacos, I prefer the meat to be juicy and flavorful (with spices). The lettuce and tomatoes should provide a crisper texture to the food, and clear the palate of the spices. Unfortunately, neither the steak taco nor burrito did this for me. The meat was drier than I'd like; the salt covered up most of the flavor of the meat and the spices. The lettuce and tomatoes, while fresh, did not lighten the flavor. Additionally, the salsa on the side added to the saltiness.  Overall, good service, but food didn't have the complexity of flavors that I'd look for at a taco/burrito joint."}
{"text":"Good food.  Amazing salsa.  My last order came with a pile of tortilla chip crumbs, but I don't go for the chips anyway."}
{"text":"I AM NEVER GOING BACK HERE AGAIN!!! The last few times I went there I got there nachos and it came in a decent size box, so yesterday when I got the same thing it was in a smaller box the guy ringing me out said we never give our nachos out in this box and went on to tell me that it is losing him money and he demanded for me to tell him the person that put the nachos in a bigger box after I said that I had no idea because it's been a while that I have been getting this nachos he went on making me feel like shit just for making sure I ordered the right thing he was a straight up ass, oh and it gets worse, Not only did I get yelled at for asking if I got the wrong order of nachos, my co-worker went and got the same order of nachos because he was Hungary and what I had got was something he wanted! Then when he picked up his order the guy straight up told him \"Let me ask you a question, does this looks like a lot of food to you\" my friend replied \" I guess I mean it's enough for me\" so he went on to say \"because some guy was just in here bitching about the portion size\" and didn't realize that that was my friend, how do you get bitching about the portion size from asking if I ordered the right nachos, and not only did you talked shit to me you went on still bitching about me to your other customers And that should never happen if your working in a restaurant!!! the guy is a fucking ass and I am never going back!!!"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious, satisfying, and affordable. Being close to Brady's Leap also is a huge plus."}
{"text":"First time going there literally just got home and best thing I've ever had!!!! Way better then chipotle!!! Very nice place to go!!! My steak burrito is amazing n so are there chips n sides!!! Definitely got my moneys worth!"}
{"text":"I've been eating here for about 20 years. Very good locally made burritos and tacos and sauces. They also have a decent sized list of microbrews now. College- Boho atmosphere. The only thing I don't really like is it happens to be incredibly small. However, go in the summer, order your food, and eat it out on the patio at The Zephyr, the bar right next door. Their patio even has a pickup window for Taco Tonto's. My favorite thing about Tontos are their daily specials. They blend all sorts cuisines into their daily creations, you never know what they'll have on special from day to day. One example is a grilled Tandoori chicken burrito, very good. They also have some very tasty vegetarian options, like a sweet potato burrito. Also excellent."}
{"text":"I may be biased since my dad is Tonto and my mom started this place a million years ago but I LOVE Taco Tonto's.  I used to sit on the counter at Walter's when it was located there and yell out \"bullliiitttos\".  For some reason, I didn't think there was an \"r\" in burrito.  The most amazing part, is that food really hasn't changed even though several people, including my step-mom and my aunt were in charge of taco tonto's after my mom.  The food is always good -- i always get the chicken burrito, add pintos, guac and get it extra crispy.  I like that they don't try to stuff what seems to be a small country into the tortilla.  The size of the \"regulata\" is perfect.  I've never had the biggie size but i hear it's too big.  The quality of the food is great especially considering the price.  If you want to spice it up, you can always add chipotle or jalapeno peppers.    Taco Tonto's is probably my favorite place in Kent to eat -- part of it is definitely nostalgia, but the food is so good.  The service is friendly too and if you happen to want to drink with your meal, you can sit on the patio of the Zeph and have a beer.  You don't even have to change venues since they have an order window right on the patio."}
{"text":"Taco Tontos with colleagues before winter break. Never disappoints! The potato burrito is my go-to and there isn't a bad sauce in the place. Ordered by phone and even though I was running late, the food was still hot, even plus the 20 minute drive back.   Only regret is that they not have their specials listed on their website so I discovered too late that there was a curried tofu, which would have been a vegan delight!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and friendly staff. What's not to like? I'd go as far as to say this is my favorite restaurant in Kent. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Taco Tonto's is a million times better than Chipotle and you just HAVE to trust me.  Go!"}
{"text":"The food was cold and very bland. The woman who took our order was more interested in flirting with male customers  than getting our food prepared correctly. The customer alerted the employee that we were standing ready to order and she waived us off.  We were not greeted like other customers were. The music was so loud when we first entered we could not hear each other.   If you want cold, bland food with rude employees, this is your place."}
{"text":"I like the location but couldn't get hog wild about this place anytime going there.  At least my mind felt like it was melting when I sat down to eat in there."}
{"text":"Taco Tontos is the hidden gem of restaurants in Kent.   The food itself is amazing, and the portions are huge! I'll probably be eating my burrito bowl for a few days, happily! The reason I'm giving a four star review is because the entire restaurant is probably one of the smallest restaurants in Kent. I actually saw people leaving because of how crowded it was getting. It's not that there were a ton of people in the restaurant, just the way the inside is set up made it seem even smaller than it already is.   I will be visiting Taco Tontos in the future, I'll just get my food to go."}
{"text":"I was in the neighborhood the other night and had a ferocious rumble in my stomach. I remembered I had just downloaded the Chipotle Ordering app on my spankin' new iPhone and thought I'd try it out on he nearby Chipotle. I mentioned this to my friends, who lived in Kent, and I remember them giving me this collectively disappointed look, kind of shaking their heads. They reminded me I'd never had Taco Tantos.  Thank goodness for their intervention. Don't get me wrong -- I still love Chipotle. But there's no reason to go there when you're near this place. I had a delicious sweet potato burrito for dinner. And even with my voracious appetite, a \"regulata\" filled me right up for less than Chipotle would have cost.  Oh, and if you're an animal lover, you may appreciate all the literature posted on the walls about the evils of puppy mills. A little random for a burrito shop, but noble, nonetheless."}
{"text":"The owner contacted me about our experience and replaced our entire meal for free.  As we live about 45 minutes away and don't eat there often he could have said to heck with us, but taking care of the customer and making it right was more important to him than the money.  Kudos for fixing a bad situation and earning our loyalty!"}
{"text":"These guys BAKE their monstrous burritos in an oven so they're super crispy on the outside and bubbly gooey delicious on the inside.  The first time I tried one, I attempted to devour it while driving in my car.  Big mistake.  But the burritos are life changing.  It's not fine dining by any means...just no frills, Kent, Ohio college town taco stand.  Must GO NOW!  Food coma later."}
{"text":"Sooo this place was absolutely amazing ... back in the day!! And I remember those days! These days it reminds me of every other aged hippy joint ... ya know when hippy becomes yuppie!  Their food is still good and the salsa is amazing but all the feel is slowly leaking out the corners and leaving a sterile enviroment is in its place! No more bathroom graffiti or business card tack board... art is going away. It is just sad."}
{"text":"I love Taco Tontos! They were delicious when I was in college and would eat it on the patio at the Zephyr and they are still delicious. I love that they use local eggs for their brunch burritos. The price is amazing for what you get."}
{"text":"Best Burrito anywhere! It has been this way for over 30 years!!!! I have referred so many friends here. They are skeptical at first, but once the food arrives they are already talking about coming back. Order in advance by phone and you can pick it up. Or you can stand in line and place your order. Everyone in Kent is very familiar with this terrific spot. The Burrito here is better than any Mexican restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"Okay, this was my first time here, and I was pleasantly surprised by how good the food was. I ordered chicken tacos which were HUGE. I should have only ordered one because the portions are large. The queso was very delicious--not too spicy, and very creamy. The guacamole was average, a little too much lime juice. The margarita was nice and strong. Overall, the food was super yummy.   However, the restaurant itself was small and crammed. It took a long time to order, there were few people working, it was kind of dirty, and the computers weren't working. I saw the lady who was taking orders use her bare hands to wrap up a burrito (no gloves), and proceeded to do cashier and wrap up burritos with bare hands. Ick. This is a good restaurant for people who want take out Mexican food, or don't mind a crammed setting."}
{"text":"When I say quick burrito, what comes to mind? did you say chipotle? Good, because Taco Tanto's shouldn't and not in a bad way. These aren't your normal conveyer belt ingredient choosing burritos. They're baked to gooey perfection, Taco Tanto's lays it on thick.   The burritos are so good that I must admit, I haven't gotten past them on the menu. Luckily, It's a decently large menu ranging from starters to taco salads. The guacamole and salsa seems homemade, and is delicious. Topping it off with homemade medium and hot hot sauces, you can't go wrong.  - @ZakirGhazi"}
{"text":"Really wasn't impressed with this place. I ordered their sweet potato with black beans burrito but asked for just sweet potato & cheese. Sadly I did not even get to take one bite of my burrito because it had onions in it when I asked for none :(  Not a big deal, or so I thought, to ask them if they could remake my burrito.   I waited over 15 minutes for someone to show up at the window to see what I needed. Then when I explained the no onions, the guy got an attitude & said that all of their burritos have onions & they couldn't remake it for me. That it clearly states on the menu that it has onions inside. Although this is true, my friends & I  thought the onions were added to the burrito, not mixed into the sweet potato mixture. If someone requested no onions, then the employee should've explained that - what if I was allergic? *hint, hint* The guy was just a jerk all around & I feel their menu is too small & doesn't offer enough variety.   Sorry, if I wanted an order of sarcastic words & \"my sh*t don't stink\" service I would've gone to a bake sale at the local church!"}
{"text":"Ugh, I've been missing this college taco joint so hard since I moved to DC. Toasted burritos are what they do here best, but over the course of my time in Kent, they began to add more specialty burritos and stews such as the Hot Hungarian (which had Polish kielbasa. NOMS). For vegetarians, they had quite a few good options including their sweet potato burrito which this carnivore had a number of times. They have also added a variety of craft beer (in bottles) to their eat-in menu.   The only downsides to Taco Tonto's are that the place gets very cramped during lunch and if you want to get certain salsa with your taco/burrito, it will cost you a couple extra cents.   The main manager/owner knew me as a regular and remembered my name every time I came in. You don't get that at most restaurants in DC, let alone have store owners take the time to recognize their frequent customers. Ah, the Midwest. Your friendliness is much appreciated.   If you ever find yourself in Kent, Ohio and want to support a great local business, definitely go to Taco Tontos!"}
{"text":"Awesome burrito's, good guac and chips, good quesadillas.    But the best part is the salsa's and sauces, the hot sauce is amazing!  Love it"}
{"text":"Great food, super filling too. If you haven't ordered tacos here before you're missing out."}
{"text":"I liked Taco Tonto's a lot when I lived in Kent. My friends and I decided to go to Kent last weekend and walk around town. We did lunch at Taco Tonto's. The food is still really good. Grateful Dead, Rolling Stones and other classic rock tunes played. Coming here really made me miss Kent. Then the punk kids started rioting that day. And the sad thing is, some dudes I used to hang out with started that stupid College Fest. I also saw a dude pissing behind a dumpster around the corner at 3 pm. It reminded me of the weird, creepy creature in David Lynch's Mulholland Drive. This bastard was just as creepy. I am happy they are bringing Taco Tonto's to Lakewood."}
{"text":"I guess I never understood the hype of Taco Tantos or I just order the wrong things. Its definitely an eclectic type of restaurant and interesting little window where you order. If you ask me I prefer chipotle which has a bit more kick and flavor to their burritos."}
{"text":"Absolutely okay. Better than Taco Bell. Not as awe-inspiring as Chipotle. In fairness they're cheaper but burrito is smaller. You won't regret it, but you won't recommend it either. I feel I could cook a similar product at home."}
{"text":"A wonderful rival to Chipotle.  A new friend recommended this place and I'm so glad we went!  Excellent flavor in a big package!  I tried their El Biggo Chicken Burrito with rice, sour cream, tomato & lettuce and hubby and I both shared a Sweet Potato & Black Bean soft taco.  It was fabulous.  I would have never thought that sweet potato would have been good in a taco.  I couldn't have been more wrong!  Sweet little joint that is trendy and casual.  Wish I would have come here sooner!"}
{"text":"This place is the burrito equivalent of the classic one-man used-books store: cramped, dim, not exactly spick-and-span, and a little confusing at first. The kind of place where the owner has his own system for sorting the books onto unfinished plank shelves and he puts your musty purchases into plastic bags bearing the logos of several different grocery chains.  So, Taco Tonto's: Climb the concrete steps, shuffle around the stools and see the menu on the back wall. Wonder: Where do I order? Then notice that what you thought was just an opening from the kitchen to the dining area is, in fact, where orders are taken. Order, get your chips and salsa right away, and grab a stool by a narrow ledge to wait. The order of chips is massive and begin to realize you've overestimated your hunger.  Hear your name called and look around, confused. Walk up to the opening where you ordered and just see people busy cooking. Look through and see there's a window cut into the wall on the other side of the kitchen. Go back around to the entrance, down a short, narrow hallway, and find your order waiting. Or, at least, what you think is your order. Get somebody's attention and ask; yes, it's yours.  Grab your plasticware from the side of the soda machine, where there are also some slightly grubby-looking squirt bottles of hot sauce.   Discover that the burrito is good -- but probably much better if it were late at night and you were a poor, starving college student. Realize that it's been many years since you were that. Sob gently into your chicken burrito. Leave at least a third of it behind when you bus your own spot and leave."}
{"text":"Like the rest of the reviews say, this is the place to go if you're looking for a burrito. Skip the line of college kids at Chipotle one day and stop by Taco Tonto's.   The ingredients may not be as fresh or organic as Chipotle's, but the sauces and the way these choices are made are worth the new adventure downtown."}
{"text":"There is NOTHING not to love about this place.  Real informal, wonderful food & great prices!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Beef burrito and cheese burrito are my fave, only thing I've ever had. Why change a good thing? Lol Been here throughout the years. Always call and get it to go."}
{"text":"This a a great little taco/burrito bar in downtown Kent. I come here often, especially when I visit my son. I like the food. The portions are very generous. You will definitely have leftovers, unless your a college kid ( you might then polish it off).  The atmosphere is soft of young hippyish. I do however get annoyed with the way they take my order. The order counter in very small and in a corner. The menu is large and varied, not very well laid out. This always delays my order because it's hard to tell what toppings etc. go with whatever I order.  It also does not help that there are 2 different menu boards in different locations with different items.  The owner is the one you usually runs the counter. I find him to be tolerable, but generally impatient.  I go for the food."}
{"text":"Took my Californian husband to try his first ever Taco Tonto's burrito on a nostalgic trip back to Kent, and it did not disappoint. Same texture... ohhhh, that texture. We would often imitate this at home during my college years. Both my roommates at the time worked there, and knew the tricks of the trade.   I hadn't been there since it was located in the bowels of The Loft. The old Subway location is way better suited! And they have beer.  There is a new owner and he's a really nice guy. They've added some new items (great cilantro salsa!) to the menu. There's lots of excitement over the new location going to Lakewood!"}
{"text":"Food was great, and owner Fred was very personable and I like that he changes up the menu to reflect his clients likes. Hopefully he will put in menue the tacitos with cilantro we alked about."}
{"text":"First of all, I didn't get the vegan sour cream that I paid for. Second, I watched the waitress serve a table that had come in after me but I had to pick up my food from the pickup window. Then she brought out food for the same table *right* after I picked my food up from the window. Since they're selective with who they serve and who they don't, I'll be selective with where I spend my money. Sad thing is I drove in from Akron for the food. I'd been craving tacos all day."}
{"text":"For years I've walked by this place wondering if it was any good... now I feel like an idiot for not going there sooner. Wow!   It's pretty cool inside, small but colorful, lots of character... plus its elevation provides a nice view of Kent.   The food was really good! I ordered the 'el biggo steak burrito' and a chicken soft taco. The taco was much bigger than I expected and the burrito was enormous, it puts Chipotle to shame. Plus I added the 'Fatali Ghost Sauce', freaking awesome! Lots of food (fresh ingredients) at a reasonable price.  If you're downtown you might be tempted to try the new Mexican restaurant around the corner (Fresco). Don't. Save you money and hop over to Taco Tontos, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Taco Tonto's has some of the tastiest food in town.  I am a loyal chipotle fan, and the first month I was in kent I ate here probably at least 5 times.  They have different specials every day and they're always FANTASTIC.  Their meat is savory, their rice is tasty, and someone in the kitchen knows how to spice properly - it's not all about Tabasco sauce for once.  I still eat at chipotle, their taste combos are too fantastic for me to just ignore, but if you want to spice things up a bit (xD) give these guys a try. :)"}
