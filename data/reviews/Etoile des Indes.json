{"text":"I have to agree with the first reviewer, very disappointing.  If you want better Indian food at an amazing price, I would have to recommend Thali on the corner of St-Marc and St-Catherine a block away."}
{"text":"Mon restaurent préféré par excellence! Tout y est tout simplement savoureux. Le Naan est fait avec des graines de carvi, ce qui le rend encore plus goûteux et le riz avec des fleurs de safran. Pas besoin d'aller à Parc-Ex pour se faire un bon repas indien"}
{"text":"Not sure what was going when the Montreal Mirror wrote that review of Star of India but something must have changed. Their food was marginal.... and that's talking about the best dish I had.   I think what really took the cake was when I had an order of chapati (for $1.50) and only 1 came. What's with that?! It's like buying a bag of chips only to find out that there are only a few in the entire bag.....   It's like an electronic toy given without the batteries on Christmas...  I mean if this chapati had been made with golden, mythical, Elysian wheat then maybe the price would have been justified...  Ok i'm done. Star of India, like your name implies, only 1 star for you."}
{"text":"Ate here and found: the food excellent. Shared the mixed combo platter, sag aloo, aloo gobi, Bangalore chicken. Also two nans and 4 chais....bill was 60 bucks. So....go here for good Indian food, great service and no frills dining. It's not an 'ambiance' place...it's small and kinda tired in it's decor...but go for the tasty eats. The Bangalore chicken was insanely spicey. Not a deep resonant spicey but insane nonetheless. The chais were excellent."}
{"text":"One star (no pun intended) just to be polite. The worst expensive Indian food I have ever had. Had the chicken korma, it was bland and on the cold side. Would not go back."}
{"text":"Food poisoning on Valentine's Day.   This place cost me $20 for tasteless food and then an extra $180 night at a hotel. Yes, throwing up violently and spending an extra day in a city I'm visiting bedridden is exactly my idea of a super fun time. I would recommend you never go here, ever, unless you find Russian roulette enjoyable!"}
{"text":"The service was really good but the food was quite tasteless. We ordered a few different curries and they were all very similar tasting which was a bit of a shame. The food isn't awful but nothing spectacular and I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"\"Words cannot describe the amount of anguish and sorrow that this company has caused me in a short yet long period of time. FIRSTLY, upon ordering, we were told that they did not accept debit, a bold faced lie as as soon as we told them we did not have cash, they quickly said that they accept debit (DO NOT FALL FOR THIS TRAP!!!). SECONDLY, we were promised that the order would take about 30 minutes, another bold faced lie. The order took about an hour and a half to deliver. In this hour and a half we were called THREE TIMES by a man who most certainly had just awoken from a 30 year coma and could not find a simple house. 0/10.\" - Daniel   ...       \"Food was good. 4/5.\" - Josh   \"Infinity/5. So good. I ate till my belly became distended, then ruptured, sending packets of curry everywhere, didn't care, ate that slop off the floor, still very good.\" - Drake  \"Nice. 4/5.\" - Rachel"}
{"text":"Best indian food in town. Have been having dinner here for a long time. Favorite dish is their chicken tandoori, very juicy and flavourful!  The meal always started with a complementary pickled carrots with papadum. The staffs are always welcoming and friendly. Usually we would order combo for two- you get two meat dishes, one vegetable dish, appetizer and desserts. It came with rice, nann bread and salad.  It's a lot of food and great value!"}
{"text":"Montreal is full of great places to get Indian food. Star of India is certainly not one of them. The butter chicken was too sweet and the Chicken Madrasi didn't taste like anything I've ever had in other restaurants. The most disappointing part of the meal was the Naan bread, which tastes like it came straight from the supermarket shelf. You can get a lot better food for much cheaper in Montreal if you are willing to do a little bit of research and get out of downtown."}
{"text":"This restaurant is good, i haven't tried all the indian restaurants in Montreal but the food was good and the service excellent. I taste the curry fish and it was very good, all my friends like their meals. You should try it !  Ce restaurant est pas mal bon, je n'ai pas essayé tous les resto indiens à Montréal mais j'ai bien aimé mon poisson curry juste assez épicé. Tous mes amis ont bien aimés leurs repas.   Vous devriez l'essayer !"}
{"text":"This place looks like it has had numerous health-code violations and the food is extremely overpriced, meals do not include rice or naan and the dish I had was extremely bland and possibly older than it should've been. Not to mention the service was rather on the pompous side."}
{"text":"Rude staff, expensive food, tiny portions, terrible ambience. DO NOT GO for Indian food. Guaranteed to leave a bad taste."}
{"text":"One of the first Indian restaurants I have ever eaten at. Actually I think it might of been the first. I don't know if that disqualifies me from being a half decent critic. But I have eaten tonnes of Indian food since, and this place just didn't cut it. The food was bland, uninspired, and presented in a sloppy fashion. Granted it is Indian food, but I believe that Indian unfairly gets a bad rap for being mishmash food. I think this place gets away with serving sub par Indian food, I do not recommend it."}
{"text":"Please do yourself favor and don't go there if you want good Indian cuisine. The food is dry and overcooked and the flavors are way off. Perhaps it had its glory days in the 90s but no longer. There are plenty of other good Indian restos like Thali right around the corner and Taj not too far. I definitely confirmed with my south Asian friends that this is not authentic food that's cooked well. The prices are also quite high for very average food. I honestly think you could do better with buying the jars of sauce from the grocery stores and pouring it over meats that you cook at home."}
{"text":"Food was horrible. Totally not worth the price. Nothing was good apart from the pakoras."}
{"text":"From the reviews it looks like you either love or hate this place. We vote LOVE! We ordered delivery for a Saturday lunch. We shared a tandoori chicken (it is half a chicken)  It was so perfectly cooked and moist, it comes with a huge portion of rice and enough salad to share. We also had an order of garlic Naan, didn't taste any garlic but it was warm and good. We shared 2 desserts, the fried milk balls in cardamom sauce it was delicious and a fresh coconut dessert that was moist and sweet. We will be ordering again and again. Our order was so carefully packaged we really appreciate that after other restaurants have delivered food leaking all inside the bag. The food is not expensive at all our total including a $5.tip was $33."}
{"text":"Terrible - butter chicken tastes like sugar, straight up.  The beer may or may not be home brewed by the owner... at least it tasted as such. Get a bottle of beer if you order one**  I won't be going back"}
{"text":"I don't eat Indian food that often so I don't really know what is good 'good'. I ordered the beef curry and buttered chicken and it was okay but not memorable. Rice or naan not included! :( The kebab appetizer wasn't that great (dry and expensive) overall soso."}
{"text":"The staff was good, but the food was horrible.. Had butter chicken but it was sugary, the naan doesnt seem like its made in house, and the samosas were nothing exciting.  Ive had indian food at all sorts of places in Montreal, Toronto, England, and even India. Go somewhere else if you are craving butter chicken."}
{"text":"Despite of poor reviews of this place, we went here for a dinner on a weekday. The experience was enjoyable. First come two complimentary starters, the pickled carrot and mango pickle. We love them both.  My husband ordered a fried rice in a yellow color. I don't know its name because I found another table having it and asked for the same. It was mild but flavorful. I ordered a butter chicken and it was a OK.The chicken meat chunk was too big to the suck in the flavor.  We also ordered a papadum and it goes well with the mango pickle. The service was great and the price is very inexpensive. We will come back for sure to try some other dishes."}
{"text":"So after stopping here for dinner while vacationing in Montreal, I was really surprised it had such a low star rating on yelp. I think that some of the older reviews are out of date - b/c this place was really good!! The staff was super nice, and the food was delicious! I had a vegetarian sampler plate, which was a ton of food for an awesome price. The chef's fruit sauce that came with the samosas was so good! I wish he bottled that stuff for sale. The garlic naan was also great, and my boyfriend said the lamb curry was amazing. They gave us both a dessert at the end of dinner, which I can only describe as something similar to a donut hole soaked in a delicious sugar syrup - yum. I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I found Star of India to be alright. Nothing overly wrong with this restaurant from what I experienced.  When I came in, I got served immediately and the waiters were pretty quick to take my orders and check up on me which I like. The butter chicken on their menu tastes and same with the chapati bread. I found the prices here to be somewhat reasonable and the decor of this place was kinda East Indian like, which is expected.  Overall, I found this restaurant to be good and could be worth a second visit but then again, I'm not the biggest fan of Indian fan, just occasionally.  FINAL GRADE: B"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good, and their service is great. I've been here a few times, and I feel that the quality of the naan has dropped a bit, but the food is actually quite good, and very flavorful. The can really increase the spice level if you request it!  The quality is not too bad either, however, their meat portions aren't very hearty, however their service is amazing! The servers are very attentive.  It can get a bit pricey, even for a modest outing though (about $20-35 per person), but good place to check out."}
{"text":"Greaat service, very friendly lot, I wish the food was as great as the service. It was Ok indian food, not awful, but not great, and it was not that spicy, which was disappointing"}
{"text":"Excellent, on est allé par hasard et on a adoré! Le service est super bon et on a vraiment bien mangé! Une petite place à ne pas manquer"}
