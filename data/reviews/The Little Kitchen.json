{"text":"If you're looking for a good basic breakfast, this is the place. Good prices, free coffee with meal and great service."}
{"text":"Please come and visit us at the Little Kitchen.  As of 04/14/2014 The New Owner Eli and Manager Teresa, have been making some positive changes. Our business hours are 6am-2pm tuesday-sunday  :)"}
{"text":"Cute place, nice people.  I really wanted to like it more because I was looking for a local place for breakfast.  Biscuits and gravy were bland-unfortunately, that is what I was looking for.  Wife's french toast was good and son's pancake was ok but portions were small.  Extra star was for the service and owner (I think).  Very nice and helpful.  I will go back and try again.  Hopefully it will be better."}
{"text":"Family Owned with Homemade food! No powdered eggs here. This is my 5th visit in 3 months. (Usually cuz I don't eat breakfast) Awesome cook who CARES about the food he prepares!! Small dining area so they fill up quick like most East Valley Cafes but Fast Service gets you in and out with a full stomach of REAL food. Friendly and accommodating serving staff! Give the Little Kitchen a try and support small/local/family business! Not crappy careless Corp Denny's down the street with lower quality food then \"Govt Cheese\""}
{"text":"Very clean and bright inside! This place is a little back from Main Street but worth finding. Service was good and fast. Got my meal very very fast, out of the place in 30 minutes or less. No magic here but breakfast is easy to pull off and they do!!  Give it a try if you want a quick traditional breakfast."}
{"text":"What a neat little place... I ate there about 6 times now ...great breakfast very reasonable price they have the nicest waitresses... Theresa and Angel... I highly recommend and have never been disappointed food is great and the service is perfect"}
{"text":"Just have to say Wow! what a turn around this place has made since the last time we were here! Been a couple years since we had been here.  I ordered the chicken fried steak and eggs with home fries and sourdough toast, was fantastic!  Chicken fried steak is normally my \"go to\" if its on the menu, and LK doesn't disappoint.  While I have had larger chicken fried steaks, I was totally stuffed after eating theirs.  My wife ordered the Green Chili stack, i tried a bite (wasn't my favorite), but she loved it.  It was a huge portion so she took home about 2/3 of it to eat later.  Leftovers always a plus!  We will definitely be coming back here, a lot of things on the menu I still want to try, like the LK Garbage and The Legendary LK Burrito."}
{"text":"Owners are great but the food is very bland and average at best."}
{"text":"Too expensive for what you get. It's just breakfast, nothing special. The owner, who was also waitressing, seems to have a super fake, 'holier than thou' demeanor. I also heard her talking about other patrons after they left. How rude. I won't be back and I'll spend my money at ANY other local restaurant who appreciates ALL their customers."}
{"text":"the food was good.  silverware clean but .... well could use some sprucing up ..."}
{"text":"I really like this place! Brings back memories of another time a less stressful time. Everybody is always so friendly and the food! the food is fantastic! Much much better than Mickey D's"}
{"text":"Chicken fried steak was absolutely awesome! Little trinkets all over the walls reminds me of a country grandmas house which is really neat. It was a little humid inside, but it was probably due to the rainy weather. Overall great experience will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Can't even give one star. Lousy service. Had to leave after waiting 30 minutes for a simple breakfast."}
{"text":"This place has been around as long as I can remeber and I've lived in the surrounding area for over 30 years.  So we finally decided to try it.  Sunday morning, snow-bird season is not a good time to try it.  THe place was packed and we had to wait to get in.  The food was ok, nothing special but it was good. But we are both on diets so we got very plain food so I realy shouldn't be to judgemental.    The service was really slow, but they were packed and there was a help wanted sign in the window so they were obviously down a waitress.  Our waitress was nice, friendly gal.  I will definately go back, but I will wait till summer and the crowd is gone."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a home cooked breakfast, look no more. More of the authentic heart of American breakfast, chorizo is not part of the menu. Friendly staff and fast service is what you'll get here."}
{"text":"Small and quaint, the servers are friendly. Food is good, coffee is hot. Even in summer, they have decent patronage. I  sure the winter will be busy. We always like small, locally owned business - and we love our breakfast places."}
{"text":"Great price, great food, nice staff..it's a keeper. This Chicagoan doesn't like 'chain' food . This is great home cooking"}
{"text":"The owner looks like she comes from a refuge camp, totally unkempt. Very crowed seating, but food ok nothing special at all."}
{"text":"This family owned establishment was delicious! The service was great. Angel our waitress was phenomenal! The food was delicious and everything is fresh and homemade. You have to try it or your missing out!"}
{"text":"Wow!  First time here, I ordered the Colorado chili stack.  AMAZING!! My guest got the bacon burger and loved as well. Very pleasant service .  I will come back."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews for this place, I opted to give it a go.  Coming to clean the table AFTER I sit?  Not off to a good start.  Food came out quickly but the reviews I read had me anticipating something better.  The food, while not terrible, wasn't exactly great.  It was decent.  Won't make a second trip, though."}
