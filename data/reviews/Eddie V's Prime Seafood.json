{"text":"The service throughout the night was inconsistent.  I asked how the shrimp was prepared.  The server said, \"medium, we prepare all of our fish medium.\" Uncooked shrimp? No thanks.  We ordered two appetizers, a salad, steaks, and a side dish.  The oysters were placed on the table without explanation of the accompanying sauces.  The salad was good, tomatoes were fresh.  The lobster mashed potatoes had so much butter that it was pooling around the edges of the bowl.  One steak was overcooked, came out medium well instead of medium rare.  The server took it back and the manager quickly came over to apologize and offered to even cook both steaks again so we could eat together.  We felt it was handled appropriately and would easily have returned for future meals after this.  However, the steak never came out.  I asked the server after a long while to see if it may be ready.  She came back from the kitchen frazzled and said, \"it will be out but I don't have a time to give you.\"  Then a kitchen manager brought a piece of meat, set it down, did not wait for me to cut it open and quickly left. It was very fatty and appeared to be NOT the cut of meat (filet) that I had ordered.  It was over cooked, again.  The server happened to walk over and said, \"yes, I thought that it didn't look right.\"  I left without eating dinner.  She brought the check over and said, \"I'm sure you guys don't want dessert, so I brought the check.\"  The manager never followed up to see if I had received the new steak.  The issues could've easily been solved had someone not dropped the ball and given up on following through.  They did credit the check for two steaks, but really that was not the issue.  Unfortunately, this restaurant was a big let down."}
{"text":"The new restaurant is first rate - gorgeous interior, great service, great food.  Very busy, great atmosphere."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been in search of some good seafood for a while. Finally decided to try Eddie V's and we weren't disappointed. Everything was fresh and delicious. The ambiance was pleasant. The staff were very attentive without being intrusive.  The prices aren't ideal, but everything less expensive we've tried just doesn't taste as fresh. For good seafood you're just going to have to pay more.  We will be going back often."}
{"text":"Love their Happy Hour menu! Overall best steak and seafood house. The service is always great!!"}
{"text":"Went here last fri night 3/11/16 for my daughters birthday and 14 people.  Our table was ready when we got there in a semi private room. Service was excellent.  They even gave my daughter a card and free dessert.  Food was the best I've had in a long time.  We tried many different things and everything was so good. Crab cakes were to die for along with the lobster and shrimp bisque.  Truffle Mac and cheese and augratin potatoes were excellent sides.  We loved everything.  Yes it's very pricy but you get what you pay for. I'd recommend it to everyone.  Thank you for making my daughter's birthday so special !"}
{"text":"Excellent service and the food was prepared very well to our liking. The atmosphere was pleasant.. Very cozy and romantic. We will be back !"}
{"text":"Excellent service, excellent food! Every single thing we ordered was outstanding. The live jazz in the lounge made the night even better!"}
{"text":"I love this place!! I especially like their oysters!! I think  that they have great music, excellent servers and bartenders and great music"}
{"text":"My #1 restaurant by far... Cannot say enough about the food, the atmosphere, and the service. This must have been our 10th time at Eddie V's and I felt compelled to write a review on yelp since I usually use open table. This is probably the second review I have ever written on yelp, but I can honestly say out of all my return visits I have had nothing but outstanding food and service and need to get the word out to all my foodies. For a seafood spot, this is still one of the best steaks I have ever had, (And I take my bone in ribeye seriously people) :) the only downside, we can never decide on our favorite apps and always fill up before the main course... But we power through because every course from the apps to the dessert is not to be missed. Great for special occasions, and a night out. Thank you Eddie vs for consistently providing an exceptional dining experience!"}
{"text":"We did a walk in tonight and got a great booth seat in the lounge. Great atmosphere and enjoyable band. We weren't aware that it was the first night of Restaurant Week...lucky us! Delicious fixed menu...Lobster Bisque to die for. Filet cooked perfectly and sides were tasty. We had impeccable service and simply a wonderful experience at Eddie V's!"}
{"text":"My grandson and I went to Eddie's for restaurant week the price fixed menu entitled us to a deluxe meal which we did not quite get Seabass or halibut would have been a better choice then the swordfish they gave me.  The lobster bisque was average.  I like the ambience and the fact at the tables were not too close together and I would recommend it but not so much for the food as the Decore"}
{"text":"This place was great! We didn't need a reservation we walked in and got a table right away. The service was excellent, my water was never empty! I had the Scottish salmon which was cooked perfectly and my wife had the scallops which were also good.  We also had a side of crab fried rice that rocked our world!! We ended the night with a Godiva hot chocolate cake with ice cream. Not to rich but just right. Overall our experience was great! I recommend this place over Mastros ocean club. Better value and better atmosphere"}
{"text":"I took my wife here for her birthday.  We both thought our server was really good and she was attentive without being over bearing.   Great service.   They have great bread/butter which is complementary.   We started with oysters for appetizers,  awesome.   Also got the jumbo lump crab. . Little to full of mayonnaise so unless that's what you like,  I'd skip it.   But still not bad.   Also had lobster bisque which was good.   I ordered the swordfish steak.   I loved it!   If you don't like spicy or cilantro stay away but I love both.   My wife ordered the Chilean sea bass (hong kong style).  She was disappointed with the flavor.   I didn't think it was bad but it lacked a \"wow\" factor.   I wouldn't order it.   They removed it from our bill so we couldn't complain about that.   For sides we did a twice baked potato and sugar snaps with portobellos.  Both were awesome!   The prices are expensive but on par for an upscale restaurant.   I couldn't afford to go there often but I would go back in a heartbeat.  Dessert was hot chocolate godiva cake with vanilla bean ice cream.  Order it!! Soooo good.  Great place to celebrate a birthday or anniversary.   We got a babysitter but you could take children.  Not really a great environment for them.   Great customer service,  good place!"}
{"text":"My first time at the Scottsdale location. Same dark relaxing atmosphere.  My friend and I sat at the bar, had a great bartender, good drinks and appetizers. My crabcake was cold in the middle and promptly replaced. The calamari are out of this world.  We stayed for two drinks ended up chatting with a nice couple  and had an overall great time. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This Eddie V's migrated south from DC Ranch to the Scottsdale Quarter in February 2011.  They hit it out of the park in terms of layout, atmosphere, and energy.  Love the deep and dark wood combined with glass and soft lighting.  The bartop is a beautiful rich walnut.  It's the type of place you'd like to sit at for hours.   Really like that there is a Happy Hour every day of the week.  Had two incredible Happy Hour appetizers: Lobster Tacos and Tuna Tartare.  The tacos each had the meat from one large claw, and were incredible.  Likewise with the Tartare, ample portion of high-quality tuna with avocado and mini grapefruit slices.  Very, very tasty.    Service was great. Michelle took care of us at the bar and was incredibly friendly, timely, and engaging.  She made our experience all the more enjoyable, and she's reason enough to return.    Looking forward to returning for a full dinner!"}
{"text":"Everything amazing. Ever single time.  Brian was one of the best servers we've ever had. Oysters, fried oysters, sword fish, scallops, and steak. All perfect!"}
{"text":"Eddie V's never disappoints. We come here for seafood and they never mess it up. I wish I had more room to put it in. I had a delicious red fish that was moist yet crispy on the outside. My wife had an incredibly morsel of heaven in the steamed Chilean sea bass. The meat literally flaked off on to your fork and melted in your mouth. We always love the Kung pow calamari to start. My wife let it slip that it was my birthday and our waiter picked up on it immediately. We ordered the banana foster, totally delicious. Well Eduardo, our waiter comped our desert. He made the night just a little more special. Thank you."}
{"text":"This place is really impressive. The decor, the service, the food. I would go there for a special occasion or a business dinner. I had the soft shell crab entree and it was scrumptious. I paired it with a lovely Mer Soleil Chardonnay. It was a memorable meal. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We just went here this past saturday with a party of 8. I would have to say that the overall food was good but, nowhere near the quality of Ocean Club in Kierland commons."}
{"text":"Just finished a fabulous dinner there.  My wife had the seafood (halibut) and it was simple yet delicious.  I had the NY Strip steak and it also was served simply and quite tasty.  We had 2 appetizers, lump crab cake and kung pow calamari.  The crab cake was just that - a small cake made entirely from crab.  Like it's supposed to be. No filler there. The calamari was served in a bed of asian fixings. Sprouts, peanuts, carrot slivers, etc.  Once you were able to pick out the calamari it was a spicy treat.  2 things to take away from here.  The kung pow calamari appetizer was really a very busy dish. The NY Strip steak was THICK.  I was raised on my thinner cuts I guess but be prepared.  It looks like everything that's ordered there is well portioned. Thumbs up! Dinner for 2, 2 drinks 2 appetizers, 2 main dishes, 2 desserts.  $200 with tip."}
{"text":"Friday night late reservations - sat at the bar instead. Considerate service, incredible food. My crab cake was pure Maryland style, lots of crab, not much filler. Husband had the Kung Pao calamari - spicy, just hot enough and tender calamari. Dinner was Parmesan crusted lemon sole for me and sea fresh scallops for Husband. We also ordered a side of roasted beets. Both dishes were wonderful, and the scallops were moist and sweet and BIG. We took home doggy bags as it was way too much food. They do offer half portions and we will take advantage of that option at next visit. I think we have a new favorite!"}
{"text":"I went to Eddie V's for happy hour on Saturday night and loved the vibe. Talk about people watching! It was a very interesting and entertaining crowd.  I sat at the bar (which has the best views) and enjoyed the amazing calamari (best ever) and the beef carpacchio. Those two apps were plenty to tide over my husband and I and we enjoyed a couple of cocktails as well.   I must admit, it was a pricey happy hour, but if you're looking for an upscale place that feels comfortable. I'd definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Wow. I believe the I had the Hong Kong styled Sea bass and it was delectable even with the interesting texture. We were also accompanied with wonderful live music and ended the night with a simple creme brûlée.   Great date night place."}
{"text":"How often do you get to enjoy a meal where you find yourself still telling friends about it, a full week later? My dinner at the new Eddie V's was more than just a \"meal\" - it was a full-blown dining experience!  When my food blogger friend invited me to join her in checking out the new Scottsdale Quarter home of Eddie V's, I had few expectations. I was just impressed that a restaurant that had only been open for less than a week was already packed with guests.  Our reservation was honored on time and we were led to a central four-top. When we sat down to our white linen-covered table, our server Darren asked if we would be interested in sampling a few of the restaurant's signature dishes. Absolutely!    First, Darren brought out a platter of Nouragi yellowtail crudo with finger limes, Meyer lemon vinaigrette, and micro shiso. This sashimi had teeny pearls of citrus that positively sparkled on the tongue.  The one dozen Salt Pond oysters on the half shell were probably the best I've ever had in Scottsdale. The shucker did an excellent job of capturing the oyster's briney liquor.  Next came Peruvian Bay scallops, served ceviche-style with tequila honey lime, on small pink-red shells. The sweetness of the mango, the tender scallops, and the hint of honey were an absolutely brilliant combination. But the flavors meshed even better when paired with icy cold ginger-infused vodka. If you must order only one dish at Eddie V's, let me highly recommend it be these scallops!  My companion really enjoyed the Maryland-style jumbo lump crab cake but I actually found myself wishing for just a smidge more of a creamy binder. Blasphemy, I know, especially coming from this former resident of Maryland, but this was actually a challenge to eat because there was just SO much crab and so little to hold the cake together! In fact, I'm rather impressed that the chef was able to get this cake onto the serving plate in one piece.  The Sixteen Vegetable Salad was an intriguing item as described on the menu but I wondered how it might translate to a plate. It was quite well executed and was a nice accompaniment to all the seafood we were enjoying. If I were looking for a light lunch, I could see ordering this salad with a seafood appetizer.  Our server said that even as a native of Kansas, he thought the Monterey-style corn was the best he'd ever had. While I'm not sure I'd agree with him 100%, it was good for out-of-season corn. This corn was clearly freshly sliced off the cob, as rows of kernels were only broken up by diced red peppers and spices that gave this dish a pleasant bit of zing.  Sadly, the truffled macaroni and cheese was lost on me. I'm just not a fan of the earthy scent of truffles.    As Darren explained, the Steelhead trout with coriander tomato broth and honey mussels had been freshly line-caught by Native Americans. That's quite a pedigree. I think this dish could be improved with a bit of tweaking: for instance, the crostini could be rubbed with garlic to give it a more assertive flavor. The plump honey mussels were so good that I would have happily eaten a bowl of them, without the trout, but perhaps in a slightly chunkier tomato broth. The trout itself tasted like a milder version of salmon - perfectly nice but not a standout, at least when compared to some of the other menu selections.  When the rare 16 ounce New York strip arrived, I inhaled appreciatively: it smelled absolutely fantastic. I was impressed at Darren's thoughtful touch: he brought over a flashlight when he delivered the steak knife to demonstrate the rare-ness of the meat in the otherwise semi-dim restaurant.  While my friend enjoyed the steak, I focused on the other entree. Eddie V's broiled Maine lobster was so good that I abandoned all sense of decorum and ate with my fingers, making a two-napkin-worthy mess, and enjoying every last morsel. The kitchen claims that they treat the lobster simply but I swear there was something magical in that sweet-saltiness of the lobster body meat.  Definitely consider ordering this outstanding entrée!  Were we ready for dessert? Darren delivered a flaming Bananas Foster. Who isn't impressed by fire? The four diners at the adjacent table looked on enviously until they decided to order their own. We all agreed that it was delicious -- especially with the caramel sauce.  But in my book, if it doesn't include chocolate, it's not truly dessert. Happily, Eddie V's understands and complied with a Godiva Cake that was every bit as fudgy and rich as I could have hoped for. The gooey ganache glaze was exactly how I wanted to close out this memorable meal.   Manager Paul Morris and General Manager Richard Schumacher checked in to make sure we were enjoying our meal. I appreciated their efforts to make us feel so welcomed. Thank you for the gracious hospitality and amazing food that still has me telling friends about my epic dining experience more than a week after my meal."}
{"text":"This restaurant not with the times. Yes, this is a seafood/steak higher end restaurant but if you are a vegetarian/vegan guest you don't really have an option for an entree other than a pile of vegetables that lack any creativity or unique flavor. The main irritant is there is no substantial protein source, just a bowl of carbs in the fried rice to make it seem like a traditional entree. More health conscious omnivores who desire a flavorful cut of beef are forced to purchase a giant portion at 16 ounces - no adjustment can be made...we asked. All desserts contain dairy and/or gluten, so no treats for those with specific food allergies. When we walked out the door, we felt highly disappointed. If this restaurant hadn't had a nice ambiance, this place would have earned one star."}
{"text":"Seafood was excellent. My wife and I enjoyed the atmosphere a great deal. Great customer service and a worthy alternative to Ocean's Club! Very good size portions and would definitely be back. Rick was our waiter and he did a great job"}
{"text":"Last Friday my bride and I were married in California wine country and we arrived in Scottsdale for a weekend getaway.  When we called Eddie V's for a dinner reservation the hostess asked us if we were celebrating a special occasion, and my wife explained that we were newlyweds.  When we arrived at the restaurant we were greeted by two very professional hostesses.  One of them brought us to our table and we immediately noticed that there were rose petals and a card congratulating us on our special occasion.  Our server, Eduardo, promptly greeted us and congratulated us.  The ambiance of this restaurant is wonderful, and there was a lady performing awesome music in the bar.  We each ordered delicious martinis as we looked at the menu, and Eduardo had them at our table within 3 minutes of ordering them.  We ordered a tomato salad and the filet mignon and lobster tail entree for her, and I had the bone in rib eye.  We also shared an order of the Brussels sprouts.  The wine selection was fantastic and we had a bottle of delicious Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.  We could NOT have had a better experience at this restaurant!  The food was DELICIOUS (prepared perfectly), and the service was PERFECT!  Eduardo was attentive in just the right amount, not too little, and not too much.  A few times I emptied my wine glass and within seconds he was promptly refilling it.  He is an absolute professional!  At one point the Manager of the restaurant stopped by our table and congratulated us, and then even the chef came out and congratulated us!  It's pretty obvious that this is a well managed restaurant, and the staff is top notch.  At one point the busboy picked up my bread dish and I noticed a very small crumb on the table.  As he was about to walk away he noticed the crumb and he picked it up.  That kind of attention to detail by a young man his age shocked me, but that small act was  representative of the professional treatment we received all night.  This was my first time at an Eddie V's, but we WILL be back to this location, and we will also check out the San Diego and La Jolla restaurants when we get back home.  Special thanks to Eduardo for making our special day even more special!"}
{"text":"Excellent dinner last evening at Eddie V's. Space is impressive and sophisticated without being stuffy. Top notch service. My wife and I each had Miso Marinated Tofu which was quite flavorful and nicely presented. She began with a generous serving of crab and sweet corn chowder which was immensely enjoyed. I had a side dish, again generous serving, of grilled sweet corn with cilantro and jalapeño pepper. A perfect touch of sea salt made it the treat of the evening.  Even on a Saturday in August with the city half empty due to vacations the place was packed for our arrival at 7:00.   Reservations a must."}
{"text":"Things were okay but not the best. We were greeted and taken to the table. The table was close to the bar area so it was loud even though we were in the main dinning room. The server was attentive but just seemed bothered to be at work. The manager stoped by and was polite but not over engaging in conversation by any means. I did like the glass wall to the kitchen. Food was okay. Steak was over cooked but I ate it anyway due to it taking to long to get in the first place. We enjoyed the evening but it definitely was not the best place I have been."}
{"text":"We had my grandparent's wedding anniversary dinner at Eddie V's.  Our server, Rocco was awesome!  He was super attentive and friendly, and definitely made the meal even better.    The entrees were all delicious, and for the quality, the prices seemed reasonable.  I will definitely go back again.  EXCELLENT experience!"}
{"text":"Excellent - our second time there and it was very good all around.  We started with potstickers which were ok but needed more zip and better sauce - go to PF Changs and you will get better ones that have good flavor, and are topped with crunchy radish sprouts and wonderful sauce - these were somewhat bland.  Then we had parmesan crusted lemon sole and swordfish. Both dishes were excellent - hot, just made to order and good flavor. Side of brussels sprouts with shallot and bacon was very good. Drink my husband had was not great but waiter saw the shade of the Manhattan and asked if it was ok - when told it was too sweet he promptly took it away and replaced with one that was more what we had in mind -excellent service by Eduardo - i think this place tries a little to hard to get you in and out in under an hour - i guess you could linger if you want but you get the feeling they are trying to turn over tables to make more money. The desert w tried was blackberry cobbler which was not really a cobbler at all but berries in lemon sauce with some uncooked tasteless dough thrown on top.......too cloyingly lemony for my taste but hubby ate it all.  if you want fresh fish this is the place to come."}
{"text":"Eddie's has taken Ocean Club's place as my go-to for seafood. I've dined here several times and have never been disappointed. It's tough choosing between the sea bass and the scallops which are both mouthwatering. The staff and service are impeccable even when it's a full house."}
{"text":"WOW...best lobster bisque soup ever! I love the fact the the soup was not scalding hot where I have to wait 5 min before I can start eating. The staff was very knowledgeable and eager to help. The stake and chicken were excellent. Be prepared to pay $100 for a couple...worth it."}
{"text":"Thank-you to Stefan for making our dining experience one we will never forget. The food was cooked perfect! We were treated like VIP's. Sushi rolls, Scallops, Seared Ahi Tuna (to die for), Halibut, Shrimp, Filet Mignon, Mac n cheese, Asparagus, salad, and desert. We were not rushed, Stefan made sure that our small child got his plate right away.  I cannot say enough about Stefan, Paul, and Dillon. It was the perfect dining experience. We will be back."}

{"text":"The best steak and seafood in town. Jazz every night in a bustling great bar, but 3 quieter dining rooms that cut the chatter and still let your hear the music."}
{"text":"Always enjoy dining at EVs. Great ambience and food is delicious. Staff is very friendly and really helpful. Definitely a place to take your significant other or with friends for a casual dinner and drinks. Thanks EV team!"}
{"text":"Good food but the tables in the lounge are marked \"reserved\" during happy hour for the sole purpose of having to honor happy prices for a limited amount of people, which is ridiculous. We arrived at the bar area around 6 and all tables were marked reserved until 7 pm, when happy hour ended. They were rude about opening the reserved tables also when clearly no one was sitting at them."}
{"text":"We had a fabulous dinner at Eddie V's. We were celebrating our 27th anniversary and they decorated our table with rose petals. We loved the seafood tower. The seafood was so fresh and tasty. The Chilean Seabass melted in your mouth. Save room for dessert, the banana foster butter cake is a must have. Worth every calorie. We are on vacation but we hope to be able to come back here one day. Rocco, our waiter, really enhanced the dinning experience."}
{"text":"We have been wanting to try this restaurant for a long time and finally made it this week.  We sat in the lounge, the music and atmosphere definitely did not disappoint.  We started with the fried lobster, which was great/different and reminded us a little of fair food.  The heirloom salad was great, the wedge not so much.  The bacon was microwaveable and had been sitting all day.  We mentioned it to the waitress and her response was \"I'm not surprised\".  The steak was not cooked properly, but the chilean sea bass was perfection.  The manager quickly addressed all of our issues and gave us a bananas foster which was to die for!  Our only real complaint was the waitress.  She was very unprofessional, not only did she not know how to answer questions about the menu or specials, she spoke of having her fingerprints burnt off, hiding bodies, poorly about other servers and she was very touchy with my husband which we both found over the top, rude, and very disrespectful.  Having been in the restaurant industry for a long time myself, there is a line and she crossed it.  Despite all of that, we will definitely go back, but we will request a different server, one who doesn't wear piggie tails as an adult."}
{"text":"My fav restaurant in Scottsdale. Always awesome. A close rival to my other favorite restaurant, Eddie V's in Tampa. That are always top notch."}
{"text":"One thing my wife and I try to avoid on date night are big corporate chain restaurants; once I heard that Larry and Guy sold the amazing Eddie V's brand to Red Lobster I swore I'd never go back.  However, we had just finished a movie and decided to give it a shot and order what used to be my favorite appetizer of all time, the Kung Pao Calamari.  When it arrived, my dislike of big coporate chains was reinforced with a bland dish that I had no desire to finish.  My wife felt the same way having had the earlier version.  The KPC is not what it used to be when John Carver was the chef before Red Lobster bought them out.  I admit I'm living in the past about this dish but it used to be my favorite item I've ever had in any restaurant, no kidding!  Back then it was not the rings but a calamari steak, cut into strips and the sauce was much spicier.  I think the strips may have been sauteed instead of fried but it's been too long to recall exactly.  I had this dish no less than 30 times over a few years since I was one of the regular musicians that played there; every time it was like \"I can't believe this is so amazing.\" That dish had serious flavor but, sadly, it is only a distant memory, like the hot sorority girl I met at a frat party in 1987.    To finish on a positive note: our bartender was personable and quick with the wine.  She said the calamari was going to be amazing but, if she had tried the \"pre Red Lobster\" version I doubt she would give the same endorsement.    I know there are tons of great reviews for Eddie V's so my review doesn't amount to much in comparison.  I just wish the big corps didn't water down great and unique recipes.  We'll stick with the privately owned, local places from now on."}
{"text":"Great happy hour and live jazz music!! Really enjoyed the Seared Ahi Tuna and side salad. Great service and ambience."}
{"text":"Set up a reservation for my girlfriends birthday. When we arrived at the table they had placed a birthday card for her on the table and had everyone sign it!  The food was AMAZING. It is on the pricier side, but they do give you large portions. Service was great as well. We legitimately let out server order for us and all the suggestions were great.  Definitely itching to go back."}
{"text":"This is what I exspect from a Prime Seafood and Steak Resturant. The food was delicious. Everything we ate was spectacular. The service was ok. This establishment is all about class,quality,and satisfaction."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere; lively if not older crowd; disappointed when I booked a table through Yelp and the only available time was 930pm, but when we walked in, there were plenty of seats available...it would normally be fine, but the jazz ended at 10pm...don't order anything too fancy from the bar, seems as though they stick to their cocktail menu and the other basics and not much else...food was delicious, presented well, and good portions...staff was friendly and inviting"}
{"text":"We really like to go to Eddie V's for happy hour.  Great frinks and halpf price appetizers.  The rock shrimp fritters are one of my favorites and DH always has many oysters on the half shell.  I love eating great appetizers and having an excuse to eat the to die for chocolate cake......"}
{"text":"Took my parents here for heir last night's dinner in Arizona and wanted them to have a good time, well, i didn't think it was the right choice.  Upon arrival, the restaurant called me to confirm my reservation i made through Opentable.com, which was very nice, and I specifically asked to be seated at a table that's quiet and has less traffic going through. As soon as we entered the restaurant, the loud music and open bar gave us a bit of shock, had only I know the atmosphere was like this, we would have gone somewhere else... at 6:30pm, this place was packed, again, not as I expected. We were taken to a bit of inner area of the restaurant, it was far enough to avoid the bar crowd, still the loud live music could not be ignored. Overall the restaurant is very dark, not sure what they were trying to have for this kind of moment, can't be romantic or cozy, simply because the music is way too loud. Decor is just, let's say, interesting...  Our server was very nice, he offered us some water and warm bread immediately, and went us through the specials for the night. Both my parents liked the bread a lot so we asked for a second after placing our appetizer order. The bread came out very quickly, nice and warm outside, after splitting a piece, we found out it was ice cold inside, I'm not even joking, it was like ice in the middle, I was immediately turned down, WTF?? Did my bread just came out of the freezer and went through the microwave before arriving to my table?? It was very unpleasant... it's okay if you don't have them in-house made, but don't fake it like you did and try to serve it nice and warm when you failed to defrost the middle,  such a disappointment.  Our shrimp cocktail came right after placing the dinner order. Yes, they were some nice and big shrimps, but there were only four of them, yes, I paid $14 to have FOUR shrimps, I admitted they were tasty, but really? The entrees come out pretty fast and they were all very good, thank god the food was good. We had the Scallops, Chilean Sea Bass and the Lobster tail along with some steamed asparagus. All the dishes had some very nice presentations, and all very tasty, especially loved the scallops with the hint of almonds and citrus fruit (grapefruit and orange), the slightly bitter taste of the grapefruit was such a good complement to the rich scallops.   We came out feeling very good about the food (minus the bread), but not so much about the restaurant itself. Like I said, had I know the atmosphere, I'd go to Ruth Chris. I can't really tell what kind of occasion would make me come back for more, it's so dark and so loud that it doesn't seem to fit for any, well, at least not for me...  Overall, entrees are a 4-star rating, definitely not the bread (maybe because it was free??). Decent service. Interesting crowds. And I do not like how dark it is, way too dark... so yeah, not a family gathering kind of place, no romantic cells, no classy, not trendy, upscale (?), huge selection of wine, oh right, expense accounts, anyone?"}
{"text":"Great happy hour the lobster tacos are amazing."}
{"text":"Amazing food and awesome service. Manager made us feel like we had been going there for years. Loved the ambience- great addition to our beautiful city!"}
{"text":"I'm always weary of landlocked fish restaurants but I loved it here! We had the delicious oysters, tuna tartare, crab-stuffed shrimp and au gratin and everything was delish. The service was some of the best we've ever had, and there was live jazz. Such a great find!"}
{"text":"Sat down for a very nice meal here. Large portions accompany a large check.   The Mac and cheese (with truffles) is to die for - and at $6/9 it doesn't get much better!  The wait staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Went to Eddie V's for the first time. EXCELLENT! The service, ambiance, decor and food were each first-rate. I highly recommend Eddy V's when on a date with that special someone, special occasions, and impressing friends and relatives from out of town. It must be experienced to be appreciated."}
{"text":"Eddie V's is our favorite \"special occasion\" spot back in Austin and the Phoenix location didn't disappoint. Food:  Awesome!  Flawlessly prepared. Service:  Superb!  Prompt, professional and friendly. Ambience:  Perfect!   Price:  Expensive!  Worth every penny."}
{"text":"A great atmosphere, you don't feel like your in Pittsburgh. A classy and beautifully designed restaurant. The problem I had is we were rushed through dinner. We ordered oysters and the salad came before we were done with the oysters. Then the entree came as we finished our salad. For the money  I thought they could have spaced the meal out better. The salad was just ok. The bread was great. The wine selection is good for the money. The halibut was terrific.  The music trio was solid and a nice touch. I will go back and I recommend this place highly!"}
{"text":"Always good food and good service. Just sometimes food is not cooked as ordered. But send it back and you are ready to go, don't be shy.   Great steaks and drinks. Get the bananas foster butter cake and you can't go wrong. Awesome all around.   Ask for Kristen the best server there. Enjoy."}
{"text":"We were very disappointed to have made the trip to Eddie V's for happy hour with out-of-town guests only to discover that Eddie V's happy hour policy is to reserve 100% of their tables in the bar for reservations coming in at 6:30 and 7 PM , advertising a happy hour in the bar should state that it's only at the bar . The hostess quickly slapped  down a \"reserved\" sign on a table at 6 pm when the guests left and told us basically we should have made a reservation for happy hour.  We went to Tanzy upstairs and had tremendous service and great food. The management decision to leave a bar empty for 2 hrs seems counter productive ."}
{"text":"Great food, delicious and prepared perfectly. Service was attentive and not overbearing or stiff. Some of us needed a flashlight to read the menu, but I like a dark restaurant; makes me look younger. I would recommend EV's for a special occasion or for a romantic evening. One thing odd though, when we left the restaurant some patrons were smoking cigs in our pathway just outside the door. I thought that was not permitted so close to an entrance of a public establishment. Someone should tighten up the rules at EV's."}
{"text":"I never knew food could taste so good!!! The sword fish was excellent and the truffle mac and cheese was divine!! Our server Michael was an absolute delight too! I can't wait to go back :)"}
{"text":"My wife and I love Eddie V's and go often.  Generally, we go for the happy hour specials and specifically, the happy hour oysters.  This fall/winter, they've upgraded the oysters for happy hour, but they are slightly more money.  However, its still the best deal in town for a QUALITY oyster.  Wine list is good as well.  The people watching is definitely entertaining and its, shall we say, an interesting mix of all things Scottsdale.. the good, the bad, and the ugly!"}
{"text":"A meal you can count on! This is place is somewhere you go when you crave being satisfied. Lobster tacos and the crab cake are must have appetizers. Happy hour pricing is great for a fine dining experience + live music 7 nights a week. Service is always great and consistent. We are never disappointed when we visit. If you stay for dinner make sure you get the Chilean sea bass and crab fried rice. Oh and the bananas foster butter cake with maple pecan ice cream for dessert!"}
{"text":"We sat at the bar for an hour and enjoyed the ambience.  The four of us were seated and we ordered appetizers of fresh oysters and crab cakes.  There was no filler in the cake, only pulled crab.  The oysters were fresh.  We ordered sea bass, sword fish, ribeye with bone, and the sides were warm baby beets, truffle mac n cheese, double baked potatoes and asparagus. We ordered a great bottle of wine and than we had the bananas foster for desert.  The service was spot on.  A great dining experience."}
{"text":"My wife and celebrated our anniversary @ Eddie V's last night. It was our second experience at this establishment and again it was outstanding. Great food excellent ambience. Our waiter Garrett was on top of his game. GREAT JOB EDDIE V's ."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant before their official opening and was pleasantly surprised at how excellent the experience turned out to be.  The ambience was formal but very relaxing, and service was friendly and attentive.  Also, the live music was a very nice touch.    The food, while a bit on the expensive side, was fantastic and offered a great deal of variety.  I had the jumbo shrimp stuffed with crab meat, which was very flavorful and well prepared.  In addition ,the bartender was incredibly experienced and the drinks list was extensive.  The only complaint I have was for the dessert, which was a bit too heavy and needed to lighter to finish off the meal.    Overall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant and will go again when I visit Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"This is by far the best restaurant! From the moment you walk in till you leave everything is done with class. Food is always great"}
{"text":"Service was great and food was exceptional! The oysters were fresh and my filet was cooked perfectly. Chicken was very good according to my wife. Side dishes (broccolini and 2x potatoes) were ok. Live band was awesome and not so loud you couldn't have a conversation. Energy and atmosphere was great!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend Eddie V's for a great date night in Scottsdale! Food and atmosphere are excellent! Save time for parking, they don't have complimentary valet."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour at 4 p.m. on a Wed.  The place was quiet but packed shortly after 5 p.m.  Drinks are $2 off and appetizers $3 off.  Don't get fooled by the fancy drink menu, it's cheaper to order a \"regular\" drink, my large vodka martini was $5.  We shared the calamari, excellent, the spicy tuna roll, very good, and the potstickers, pretty good.  It's very dark and we had a table with no light above so it was very difficult to read the menu.  My only other complaint was that we had not finished the food but were asked no less than 10 times in about 15 minutes for them to clear our plates.  I know people were waiting for tables but we hadn't finished our drinks yet and were still grazing a bit.  We finally gave in and let them take it away.   Immediately three waiters scooped up everything and wiped off the table.  Get to hell out was the message."}
{"text":"Congratulations on you opening!  The restaurant looks amazing and my family had a great time catching up with great food, drink and music from Mark Goodwin.  Thank you and good luck!"}
{"text":"The very best lemon sole....ever!  Maybe the best fish I have ever had.  Just delicious!!  Bread was excellent.  Didn't care for the scallops. Service and entertainment was great. Chocholate martini was super.  Blackberry cobbler had a good flavor, but the crust was not the best."}
{"text":"Yelp said it was like Capital Grill. Not even close. Food just as expensive (or more so), fish is just OK, side dishes are bland and boring (and pricey), service is adequate, but not special like Capital Grill. Ambiance is modern, but loud. Wouldn't go again."}
{"text":"Absolutely divine dinner!  The scallops were delicious, and I disagree with a previous post that they were mediocre. They were anything but.  My Fillet Mignon was the most tender and perfectly cooked I've had here in Phoenix. Due to a series of mishaps, we were quite late for our reservation, but they graciously held our table. The Banana Foster was soooo delish, and I resented sharing it!"}
{"text":"Old school seafood and steak prime restaurant with stellar quality steak, oysters, sides and cocktails. Great overall experience!"}
{"text":"I will keep this review short and simple: The BEST fish restaurant in Scottsdale/Phoenix.  Actually, one of the best overall restaurants as well.  5 stars to the chef - delicious preparation.  If you are looking for a fabulous place with great food and service in Scottsdale, this is your place.  It's pricey, but no more than any other fine dining restaurant.  I'd go every week if it was in the budget - for now, a special occasion spot."}
{"text":"We were really impressed by the steak here.  Ordered kuomato oysters (small but delicious) and the ribeye which was cooked to perfection.  Great spot for a date night"}
{"text":"AMAZING. Everything we had was the best we have eaten; sushi, crab cakes, oysters!  It's a MUST if near the Scottsdale Quarter!  We chose to eat there 2 nights in a row, once for a reserved dinner and the other for the happy hour."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. Where should I start. The service was mediocre at best, they were nice but very slow and awkward. It took an hour for two soups and some appetizers. The food was was not fresh and barely edible. The seafood looked very old and starting to turn color and everything tasted like it was heated in a microwave. It wasn't until we asked for the check to leave that our food was all the sudden magically ready."}
{"text":"Went for Happy Hour on a Friday evening and it was wonderful.  Rather crowded around 5:30 though this is to be expected and it is wonderful to see a restaurant so crowded.  Very nice ambiance, friendly and helpful wait staff (even when I did my best to get a recipe out of them to no avail this was all taken in stride so I figure they must hear this quite a bit) and the food?  Delicious!  I can't say that I have had a Crab Cake appetizer with so much crab meat in it and without excessive breading and just the right blend of spices to make each bite sing.  The sauce was a perfect balance to the Crab Cake itself.  The calamari appetizer was delicious, everything was fresh and again so balanced.  A delight.  Very nice wine list, I played it safe and went with the Kim Crawford.  I would *definitely* go back!  There truly did seem to be some kind of a time warp going on in there though because time just flew by though I personally didn't mind one bit.  I highly recommend Eddie V's!"}
{"text":"Great service, and a wonderful place to celebrate a special occasion!"}
{"text":"Food, service, and ambiance were impeccable.  The only negative on our visit was the horrific lounge singer who proceeded to butcher multiple Beatles songs to the extent that I'm sure the deceased Beatles (RIP!) were rolling in their graves.  Fortunately he stopped at some point throughout the meal.  Sooooo on that unappetizing note, let's move on to the food...   calamari - unbelievable!  Delicious, tender perfectly cooked and seasoned calamari with a great accompaniment of shallots, asian noodles, carrots, scallions, cashews, and red chiles in a lovely sauce.  halibut cheeks benedict with lobster and Hollandaise - delicious.  perfectly cooked biscuits (says the Southern girl who knows my biscuits), the hollandaise was well-done - not too stiff, not too heavy, and perfectly cooked eggs.  The little side salad with it was just ok.  lobster bisque - delicious.  Not too creamy, lots of lobster flavor goodness, pleasing texture.  asparagus with hollandaise - tender, fresh baby asparagus   corn - amazingly fresh and flavorful.  It was hard to stop eating it.  bananas foster butter cakes - a bit too sweet for my taste but everyone else loved it.  The butter pecan ice cream was divine.  godiva chocolate cake with vanilla bean ice cream - Oh.My.Goodness.  Were licking the plate not frowned upon (in some places,) I would have.  Whitehaven Sauvignon Blanc - lovely, light, fresh bouquet.  Kim Crawford lovers will enjoy it.    from the moment you walk in the door, it's all about quick, efficient, professional service.  Everything we had was amazing. Definitely a great place for a special dinner."}
{"text":"Not only was the food really good it was an excellent dining experience! Top notch!!!"}
{"text":"Overall it was an ok sea food and steak restaurant. Many choices both in sea food and steaks however my steak was nothing unique considering the price.  The restaurant lights were so low that I could not read the menu. I have had better."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre. I had the snapper my date had the halibut.  Both were bland. The service and ambiance were very good. Our waiter was very friendly and professional. I just wish the food was better."}
{"text":"Wow, where do I even start. I brought my mom here for mothers day brunch and it was amazing. The staff was all so friendly and went above and beyond to make the brunch special. The food was to die for. A cinnamon roll (heaven), apps of deviled eggs topped with salmon, truffle, and crab, fried green tomatoes, main course of lobster omelette and steak and egg with scallop potatoes. Sadly our desserts that we got to go melted in the car, but I probably didn't need more to eat anyway lol. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Best Chilean sea bass ever. Nice atmosphere great sides. Would definitely go again and highly recommend. Good job Eddie V."}
{"text":"Dined 4/24. Perfectly average. Oysters were fresh. Lobster tacos were quite good as an app. Lobster tail (1) was ok, but overpriced at 44.00 for an 8 oz. tail. Bone in rib eye was good but lacked aging and any umami flavor. Au gratin potatoes were not hot and pretty bland. Wine list overpriced ( meiomi Pinot noir 60.00, it's 17.00 at frey's). Service was ok but lacked attention to detail. Forks not replaced, plates not removed in a timely manner. Better choices in Scottsdale for the price point. Mastro and Capital Grille a full notch better."}
{"text":"I LOVE Wildfish, I LOVE Roaring Fork, and I used to love Eddie V's.   I've been to Eddie V's so many times, but the last time I went was probably my last. I ordered a glass of wine to accompany the many many oysters I was excited to eat. The oysters themselves were good quality, but they had not been properly clean and my boyfriend and I were disgusted with the whole experience. We asked the manager what was going on since we were used to such high quality there, and instead of bringing us clean oysters or apologizing...he implied that we didn't understand what clean oysters actually were. He explained that because of the quality of these oysters they do not wash them and if we ate oysters more often we would know that. Interestingly, we eat oysters all the time and I'm sure no pretentious oyster connoisseur like the one the manager was describing would appreciate pieces of shell all over their oysters either.  In the end, and after a battle on what constitutes a clean oyster, the manager took some of the oysters off our bill. However, it wasn't about having any of the oysters taken off of our bill - it was about getting what we came in for - good oysters and good experience."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a late Saturday afternoon for happy hour and sat at the sushi bar. The sushi chef was incredibly nice and kept making us samples of stuff. We ordered oysters and lump crab with avocado. Both dishes were great, especially the oysters and I'm usually not an oyster fan. The place is very upscale but no one made us feel uncomfortable in jeans and tees. I'll be going back for sure."}
{"text":"Three hours flew by last night at Eddy's.  Don't believe time is relative?  Compare three hours here to almost anywhere else.     The Good:  Crab Cake appetizer (wow), the wine list, haddock entree, stuffed shrimp, Godiva dessert, and the blueberry cobbler.  All simply perfect.  The Bad:  We were there for three hours and it felt like 45 minutes.  So, clearly time speeds up in some sort of cosmic time-space twist, while eating at Eddie's.  I'm thinking this means one ages faster (bad).  However, this has not been independently verified. ;)  Last, I have to say something about the service.  Sometimes, when eating at higher-end establishments, the service is almost \"too servicing.\"  \"Yes, sir, no sir, let me wipe your mouth sir, I can't talk to you like I'm a human, sir, it's against the rules.\"  Not so, here.  Very professional and knowledgable service, yet friendly and fun.  We even got surprised with a free dessert for being a \"fun table!\"  (And no, she didn't know I'd be Yelping.  Or, maybe she did.  Who cares!  Same result!)    Oh, I have to mention ambiance and dining room design....dark, moody, romantic.  Great place for a date...."}
{"text":"Food tastes like it was bought from Costco and reheated. Shrimp cocktail was completely soggy with brown spots on it. I get better shrimp cocktail when I get room service at a hotel. It's beyond me that this place calls themselves a \"prime seafood\" restaurant. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"OK, I will not go into detail about my phenomenal meal, however, I will say next time I'm in the area I'm coming back no questions asked. Waiter was knowledgeable about the wine and the food was excellent, and the bottle of wine we had which was the Trefethen Double T Cabernet was quite good absolutely worth the price come here if you get the opportunity. I think you will enjoy yourselves"}
{"text":"For my wife & I, this place has become our favorite Saturday date-night spot. We love live music and were first drawn to Eddie V's because of their nightly live music lineup, and while we're not hardcore jazz people (which is what the lineup is here), the music is fine - especially when Diana Lee is playing - and it's every night.  The atmosphere is great, the food is excellent and the service supreme. But it's definitely on the pricey side. Expect to drop $$$ on a night out here, especially if you have a few cocktails. In spite of that, it's still our favorite Saturday night spot. We'll probably see you there!"}
{"text":"This is one of the nicest seafood restaurants I've been to. They even had Chilean sea bass, which was amazing. We had a rather large group and everyone was raving about how delicious their meals were. The wine selection was also very good. Not too many places have Rombuer Zinfandel."}
{"text":"Uncle Eddie...Uncle Eddie. I love Uncle Eddie. This place ozzes class and sophistication. The dim lit ambiance and great live jazz being played made for a great eating experience. I ordered the prime rib and this was delicious! Being from Seattle it didn't make sense to order seafood. I mean come on.. the seafood can't be as fresh as Seattle. But I digress... come here. This place rocks."}
{"text":"Sat at bar after walking out of tru food due to crappy service, great service by Arianna. Had the halibut it was perfect! Wines by the glass a little weak A little pricey but worth it"}
{"text":"Delicious, superb service at the bar. Matt offered the right amount of attention and had great recommendations. Nice they offer a weekend happy hour.  Try the yellowtail sushimi - delish!"}
{"text":"The first time we went we had family in town and had a reservation for 7 pm. We brought our 1 year old who is always great at restaurants and his grandparents who were 2 hours ahead from same day plane travel. There was a shortage with the kitchen or wait staff or both. Needless to say the service was very slow. It took over 20 minutes before anyone took our order and we sat at the table over an hour waiting for our food. The manager did comp us drinks and brought us a comped appetizer that we didn't order which was very nice. By the time our food arrived the baby and grandparents were so tired we ended up taking the food to go. That being said when we got home and ate the food was amazing. Additionally, the manager was very apologetic and gave us a gift certificate and assured us this was not typical. My wife and I went back again just the two of us thinking we would give it another try. this time the service was amazing. The hostess (computer) recognized that we were guests of the manager, and we were treated like celebrities. The food again was amazing. I had steak, my wife had fish. I normally drink gin rocks, the glasses are good sizes and the bartenders give you a good pour. My wife loved the recommended wine pairing with dinner and the bartenders recommendation for a foo foo cocktail. We have been back many times since. I would have given 5 stars but the first experience is still holding me back. Wish i could give 4 1/2 stars."}
{"text":"Eddie V's is an interesting place, very good service, over the top good.  I found that like many \"nice\" restaurants, the place is pretty, but the food was just OK.  I liked the salad, and the Oysters ( which I had to pay full price for since I was in the dining room - If you want the happy hour pricing you have to eat in the bar.)  My steak was just OK.  All in all, the dinner was a nice night out, but next time I think it would have been better to hang out in the bar area."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! I'm incredibly picky with restaurants and I was so impressed with this place. From the moment we walked in the service was impeccable. We were early for our reservation and we were seated right away regardless. Our server was very attentive and made some great recommendations on the oysters we ordered (thank you!). And the manager was also incredibly attentive. He even dropped off a card for my wife to wish her a happy birthday. Honestly, best service I've ever had.   And the food...OMG! All the seafood was so fresh and perfectly prepared. We had oysters and lobster and both were incredible. Then we finished with the butter cake with bananas flambéd in rum with pecan ice cream. It was so good and highly recommended. Overall amazing dining experience and I will return anytime I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I have to say that Eddy V's is one of the very best steak houses that I've ever had the pleasure of enjoying a prime steak.   It beats Morton's, Dominick's and Ruth Chris leaving one with a memorable experience.  The menu has many choices from fish to steak and I found the service to be excellent and relaxed.   Nice atmosphere and jazz band.  I highly recommend to anyone looking for the high end steak house experience in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"We came to Eddie V's about a week ago for an early birthday celebration.  We were a little early, but we were seated and served bread while we waited for the rest of our party.  The birthday boy got a card at his place setting, which was a nice touch.  A few tables down, rose petals adorned the table cloth.  This place knows how to do special occasions.  We got the oyster appetizer, which was really good.  They seemed to be battered and fried, so if anyone is squeamish about the texture of oysters, this is a good baby step.  The flavor was great.  I ordered the scallops, and there were two different kinds of sea bass and steak at the table as well.  I sampled some of each, and it was all quite good, but I think my favorite was the chilean sea bass.  Super tender.  We had a side of shrimp fried rice for the table that complimented perfectly.    We didn't try any of the wine this time, but they had an impressive list.  The iced tea however, was full of flavor and a little fruity.    Bananas Foster was an exciting way to end the meal, with fire literally pouring out onto the cake.    This is a classy restaurant at Scottsdale Quarter, so be prepared to pay for that.  But the quality of the food stands up to its price, and the ambiance is great."}
{"text":"Service was pretty decent. Food was pretty decent they do offer valet parking the atmosphere was a little too uppity for us the prices were a little on the high side in comparison to some other nice steakhouses. We were here we done it and we see no reason to return."}
{"text":"Pretentious and pricey. While the seafood here was fresh, I found the atmosphere to be overdone. White-jacketed fawning wait staff delivering fairly slow service and over priced food will keep me from returning. The decor was austentacious and cold -- literally -- it was super drafty in there, and it was too loud to converse. Eating good food in a more cozy and down to earth atmospere without braking the bank is more my style."}
{"text":"Had brunch here today and everything was wonderful. Everyone's food selections were absolutely delicious, service was superb and the atmosphere was very pleasing. Will certainly dine here in the future. Thank you."}
{"text":"Good, but not as good as Ocean Club.  The new location is fantastic, and there is nothing to complain about here, but I'd rather dine at Mastro's."}
{"text":"Excellent place many locals go to. Highly recommend going during happy hr to sample . The bartenders Walter , Scotty and Lucky are friendly and recommendations were spot on.  Order the Thai themed calamari, and the crab cake. Big enough to share.  Dimly lit so they do provide flashlights, yes I am serious. Valet parking is available, but easy enough for street parking or a public lot,next door."}
{"text":"Very much enjoyed our first meal here. From the seafood tower to the lobster bisque. The filet was perfect as were the jumbo shrimp. A birthday dinner for the love of my life with our 2 adult kids made for a great experience. Larry, our server, was a pleasure to deal with and went out of his way to provide complementary champagne as a celebratory pre-meal drink. The Mavericks were excellent both in flavor and in presentation. Be prepared as this restaurant is not inexpensive. Certainly not for an everyday meal. Our celebration was, however, worth it.  Just a tip that valet does not begin prior to 6 pm. Something the restaurant did not tell me when reserving for 545, so I had to park myself and drop my party at the front door. A little odd."}
{"text":"Went back again.  Filet was awesome.  Cooked perfectly and a great piece of meat.  Caesar salad was much better this time.  The Godiva cake came out hot as well.  The wait staff was awesome."}
{"text":"Just concluded wining & dining our best clients at Eddie V's. The food and service was A+!  The food was abundant, & no one could go home hungry. Suzette (mgr) & servers Krissy, Brian & Kyle did an outstanding job!! If you are looking to make a great impression on clients, I can highly recommend Eddie V's."}
{"text":"The service was great, the food was top notch, and the drinks were stiff...I will definitely be coming back.  Here is the breakdown of each:  Service: Took a few minutes to get greeted when we walked in, but there was a rather large party congregating around the hostess table, so we were initially over looked.  Our waiter was great and made very good recommendations and describing the menu.  We did not have to wait or flag him down at any point.  Food: Crabcakes - As close to Maryland as it gets.  Lumped crabcakes were cooked perfectly with a slight crisp breading on top Filet Mignon - Order the steak medium and it came out medium, so delivered as ordered, which does not always happen. I would recommend the smaller size steak since your side dishes are rather large. Halibut - Cooked perfectly. The halibut was crisp on top and perfectly white throughout. With the right amount of lemon, I felt like I was eating fresh Alaskan Halibut in Arizona. Twice baked potato - The bacon bits were huge and fresh and the potato was delicious.  Drinks: The drinks were strong and not watered down. As soon as we got low on a glass, the waiter stopped by and asked if a refill was in order, oh yes it was."}
{"text":"Waited 40 minutes for a table, and I had a reservation. Unacceptable.  Our waitress Mary Beth was excellent.  Food was good."}
{"text":"Service was great and the filet mignon and Chilean sea bass were perfect.  Great wine list to compliment the menu.  The sea bass was prepared with a great miso broth and steamed to perfection.  Had a BLT wedge salad and that too was spot on.  Going back for sure."}
{"text":"Eddie V's. It's like getting a present from someone. It's beautifully wrapped, nice bow, and comes with all the glitter..... but when you open the gift, it's just a sweater. The sense of expectation of something great, but just fails to deliver.......  So we descended on a Friday night, celebrating my brother in laws birthday. We made a reservation at 5:30 on a Friday night and were seated promptly. We were seated at booth which barely accommodated the 4 of us, considering we had some big men in the group. The restaurant is nice, beautifully decorated and lovely ambiance.   Service-The service was great, probably one of the highlights of the night. Our waiter was excellent and \"almost\" top notch.   Food-So this is where the big letdown is. The \"sweater\" that you get from a friend. We ordered some oysters for appetizer. The oysters were very small and were semi frozen. Not impressive for 24 bucks.  For our entrée we ordered the ribeye, 8 oz. filet with lobster tail, 12 oz. filet, and I ordered a 1  1/2 of crab legs.  I'm not going to review my patrons meals, but mine was not impressive.  So here's the deal you pay 28.00 for  1/2 lb., you can get a full pound at Costco for 21.00.  The only thing nice is they split them.  Please read my review for Dominick's.  You get a whole cluster of king crab for nearly the same price!  We split couple of sides.  The brussell sprouts were cooked nicely and it was a solid dish, but the lobster mashed potatoes were a joke.  If you want good lobster mashed potatoes, please go to Mastro's ocean club, you'll see how it's done.  I should of picked up on the red flag when I noticed on the menu, it was only 18.00 bucks.  How is lobster mashed potatoes 18.00 and brussell sprouts 10.00?  Here's how........ there was barely any lobster and only meat was couple of chunks of claw meat.  Not very impressed.  In conclusion, considering they say they have PRIME SEAFOOD, I found the quality to be very underwhelming.  I can't say I was impressed with any of the seafood from the oysters, lobster, and king crab.  You can pretty much go to Whole Foods and you'll probably get just as good if not better quality seafood from them.  From the food aside, the experience and service was still very pleasant.  As mentioned before the service was outstanding from drinks being refilled, bringing us more bread, clearing out dishes, and just an overall positive attitude from the staff.  As I said  earlier \"almost\" top notch.  Well after the meal and ordering couple of desserts to share, our waiter finally asked if we were celebrating anything?  We said \"Yes, it's his birthday!\"  You would figure you would lead off that question from the beginning of the meal and not at the end.  So no complementary cake for us.  We split the bananas foster and Godiva chocolate cake.  It was ok, nothing special.  So overall pretty good dining experience, but just like the sweater....nothing special!  Go to Dominick's around the corner or head to Mastro's Ocean Club for a much better present!!!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for light bites at happy hour prices this is great. We arrived after 9 on a Friday night and it was not packed. The live music was very entertaining. We enjoyed the crab cake, which for being in a land locked state is great and the scallops too were tasty. 2 drinks each and 2 apps shared we got out for $20 each. Pretty good deal."}
{"text":"What a disappointment over all first the server was grate very attentive new the menu on top of everything now the device was very slow took 20 min between ordering none of the food we had was flaverfull very bla I tried pepper shrimp calamari shark none were good the best was the banana foster cake won't go back any time soon"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Eddie V's and our party of four was not disappointed...in fact we were very impressed!  Our server Rocco gave us impeccable attention - and just the right amount of it. We had a spicy tuna roll and Yellowtail sashimi as appetizers - both we're delicious and beautiful. We all ordered a surf & turf combo with a lobster tail and a steak choice. I chose the 8 oz filet and my companions all chose the 16 oz New York strip. The beef was flavorful, tender, and perfectly grilled. Clearly their claims of steaks aged 28 days are true - these we're exceptional steaks. The lobster tail was nicely prepared table side and attractively plated and served with our steaks. The soulful tunes from the trio in the lounge added just the right vibe to match the modern interior ambiance and five-star food.  It was a marvelous evening of dining and I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is going to be a new favorite of ours! My husband and I came here on a date night after reading the reviews and hearing that there was live jazz music. We were not disappointed! We had the Calamari to start. It was amazing and just a little spicy. Both of us ordered the New York Strip and it was one of the best I've ever had.  The steak was cooked perfectly with lots of flavor! We had a side of asparagus, which was alright. Then to finish the night we each got a desert. His Creme Brûlée was excellent. I went for the Bananas Foster and it was as good as everyone else said it was! We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"We cone here about 7 times a year, always in date night or birthdays. Food is always good and service was always on point. Tonight we went in for my husband's birthday. I asked the waitress how their strip steak (au poivre) was while pointing to their menu. She glanced at the menu and said that it was her favorite so I ordered it. Steak comes out, plain. When I mentioned to the waitress that it was not au poivre, she saif she didn't realize that i wanted it au poivre. She then asked me if I wanted her to take the steak back and have them throw some pepper on it. Uh no. Not the same. So she comes out with the pepper grinder, not kidding, and proceeds to cover my steak in ground pepper. Then tells me they will bring me the sauce. Ok. I at this point I'm thinking that you,  the waitress, have no idea what au poivre is because covering my steak in freshly ground pepper is not and does not taste the same as having it covered in cracked peppercorn and cooked. OR you think I'm STUPID and that I wouldn't know the difference. I was so upset that I only took a couple of bites of my peppered steak. The RIGHT response would have been: I'm sorry, let me have the kitchen cook you a new one.  I didn't make a scene. Didn't insist in talking to the manager. I just wanted my husband to enjoy the rest of his birthday dinner. Worse $200 spent here this evening. I hope this is just a one of and not a trend here. We really did love this place."}
{"text":"Even though this is a small chain, you who'd never know it. everything was first rate..period. When we arrived for our reservation, we were told the table was not ready and would we care to visit the bar area for drinks on the house,There was no limit given, but we didn't take advantage and has a couple of wines. We were seated a few minutes later, at a great table where we could listen to the entertainment.What a wonderful quartet !, Finally dinner arrived and frankly , our steaks were perfect.In fact, my bone in rib eye was great...one of the best I have ever had.Even The side dishes were wonderful- Parmesan fries, sautéed spinach and sautéed onions. The crazy part is that this is a \" seafood house\". Nothing to discuss here..perfect"}
{"text":"First time here with a buddy from a recommendation of a coworker. This place is awesome. Period point blank. Came here just for the happy hour, got a booth in the lounge, and drank the bullet sours like it was our job. The happy hour menu is the best and an amazing value for what you get. We had crab fried rice (my favorite), the crab cake (my buddy's favorite), as well as the lobster wontons and calamari. I'm a huge fan of lamb but didn't care for the lamb lollipops. Live music in the background, great food, amazing prices, what more can a couple of guys want? Get here before 5:30 before it gets packed"}
{"text":"My wife and I celebrated our anniversary here and they truly made it special.  We were greeted with smiles and a warm happy anniversary then brought over to our table which was delicately covered with rose petals and a card saying happy anniversary and signed by the staff.  We sat in the lounge so we could enjoy the silky smooth voice of The Talia Hendrix Trio, they were unforgettable!  The meal was beyond compare...I had the sea bass and it made my taste buds dance!  My wife had the African lobster which was over a pound!  She was in heaven!  I ordered a side of beets which my wife took most of, they were phenomenal!  I cannot thank Eddie V's for making our night so special...we look forward to our return!"}
{"text":"One of the best ribeye steaks you will ever have! But do not discount the Chilean seabass either, it is also an amazing dish.  Great and friendly service, and very intimate mood.  Perfect for a date, or a business dinner."}
{"text":"Perfect place for a special occasion dining experience. My husband and I dined on a Saturday evening and our server, Lizette, was fabulous. Great recommendations. We tried her recommended special Smoked Old Fashioned, oysters and she chose our dessert (Bananas Foster-yum!). My favorite appetizer is the steak and lobster tartar. It does not disappoint. And i tried the sole - wow. Very generous portion. My husband had the swordfish and was elated. We took food home, and we thoroughly enjoyed our evening. Great presentation, food came out at a very leisurely pace for a fine dining experience, and not pretentious. Loved it. We are more frequent lounge patrons (love the live jazz-keep that please!)  will definitely return."}
{"text":"Delicious!! This is a great restaurant with great seafood and great service!!! Our group had appetizers, salads, halibut, seafood tower, side dishes, desserts and drinks. Everything was absolutely wonderful! We had one little thing go wrong which was a lobster tail was undercooked. They quickly brought a new lobster tail out. I was very happy with the service too. I definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Great food, busy yet beautiful atmosphere and always exceptional service. Come early or stay late for the live music in the bar. A must stop while in Scottsdale. Linda from Wisconsin"}
{"text":"Eddie V's was exceptional, I have only been to this location one time before. Service was great and our server Alejandro was phenomenal and our group has actually been requesting him since he was at Capital Grille and Domenic's so I was so glad to visit him at Eddie V's. Always remembers our name and when our bill came he informed the valet so our car was waiting for us, definitely above and beyond. Bone-in ribeye prepared perfect (I was able to taste) I ordered the steamed Chilean sea bass in a light soy broth, it was Hong Kong style, I am used to sea bass grilled and it good not a lot of flavor probably wouldn't order it again. Truffled Mac and cheese was amazing rich and perfect. Broccolini with lemon and garlic very tasty and fresh. Dessert bananas foster butter cake with butter pecan ice cream OMG presentation 100 stars they flambeed it at your table, sinfully delicious! Two fantastic steakhouses in the same Scottsdale Quarter what is a boy to do?!!"}
{"text":"Went for anniversary last night. They had rose petals on the table it was nice.  My filet was the best I've ever had. Scallops were cooked perfect.  He had the swordfish and loved it. I like you can do small sides so you can try more then one. Great wine as well. And the complementary dessert of our choice was very nice. So glad we went here over Ocean Club. It was perfect."}
{"text":"My fiancé took me here on Saturday for my birthday. The food was amazing. The service was exceptional. I would recommend this place to anyone who love seafood."}
{"text":"The ambiance was great, service excellent, steak par excellence, presentation superb, live music very good and complementary to the whole experience. Seating is very comfy.   A beautiful selection of sauces to go with steak. Cognac corn-pepper cream was my choice and the medium rare filet mignon was soft like butter that almost melted in mouth.   A great wine selection complements the great food.   Very very nicely presented was the dessert that completed our dinner.   Overall 5 star."}
{"text":"Absolutely yummy! Ambiance is cozy and romantic. The food was delicious- ordered crab cake, fried rice, sashimi, and tacos! The lounge has live music too! I would go back!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar with a friend, enjoyed good service but not so memorable steak.....the special 16oz bone in rib eye was mostly bone....could be a sign of the times in mid-week ghost town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"The staff here is so friendly! I made a reservation for 15 people and they made an effort to come say hi and make sure everything was okay. The food is delicious. We got the seafood tower and I got shrimp and crab as my entree. Really fresh food!"}
{"text":"Came for happy hour on Sunday. $2 oysters, amazing crab cake, fish tacos and salt+pepper shrimp! The fish tacos were the best! They come in a tortilla that is handmade and seems like an Asian/Mexican fusion.  A good, classic spot that has an older feel when you're inside. The lighting is very dim and they give you a small flashlight to help see the menu better. We sat at the bar and had great service."}
{"text":"We went on mother's day, and the food and service were both fantastic.  They were willing to cater to food allergies, and offer a new gluten free menu.   The food was so great I went back for a business dinner two nights later.  Not cheap - but worth the money!"}
{"text":"I discovered this restaurant during my business trip. It was still early evening, so the restaurant was not busy. But, when I told the hostess that I don't have a reservation, the hostess told me apologetically that even though they have several open tables, with the number of servers that they had at the moment, it was considered \"full.\" I asked her if I could sit at the bar, and she told me \"sure\" so there I went.  The back section near the bar, they had a live band playing mellow, jazz-y music with a female singer. The bar was a pretty good size, with a few TV screens for sports fans. It certainly was a fully stocked bar, and they had good drink menu.  I wanted an interesting cocktail, so when I saw \"Bananas Foster Martini\" I thought this is IT!  When the bartender brought the glass out and lit it on fire, I was super surprised!!! He poured semi-frozen drink into the glass still lit, until the fire died down and the drink was done.  For appetizer, I ordered Point Judith Calamari. I thought it was a bit pricey, but that was before I saw the size of this thing. It was humongous!!! If I had knows it was going to be this big, I wouldn't have ordered anything else... It was tasty though, mountain of tangy calamari, on a bed of crispy noodles. It was addictive, but then the more I ate, the more the sauce felt too strong and heavy.   For the main, even though I came here for seafood, I decided to get something lighter. So, I went with Miso Marinated Tofu. They had one large square of tofu, thick and filling. I wished it had more miso flavor than it had on it, as it was kind of tasteless on its own. Fried rice with veggies and cashews did had strong miso flavor, it was great with the tofu.   My server was the bartender since I was sitting at the bar. He was polite, friendly and took a good care of me."}
{"text":"Spectacular Happy Hour! I'm in Pittsburgh for the first time and my choice for dinner couldn't have been more perfect! I'm aspiring to go Paleo so I was delighted to see that many of the happy hour choices met my needs and the entertainment was terrific!"}
{"text":"Had bday celebration with friends last night.  the band was wonderful but unfortunately only played till 10 p.m.  the CRAB CAKE was probably the best i've ever had.  nice ambiance, and lively :)"}
{"text":"Spent our 35th Anniversary dinner here. They made it special with rose petals and a card on the table. Also comped us dessert which was a yummy creme brûlée. We both had sea bass, mine the market special and my husbands Korean style. The Korean style was better. Great ambience, if you don't mind it kinda dark. Service top notch! Great menu and wine list. Definite do again."}
{"text":"ok Go to the Dallas store ALL the time but Erin made me feel more at home than Ian usually does.....  Sorry Ian.  Food is what I expect for Eddie V's.  Menu is a bit different and still excellent.  Will definitely go to this location again when next n Phoenix!"}
{"text":"The food, service and ambiance were all above par, but we had a private party so extra attention was going our way. The service especially was top notch - I'd compare it to Mastro's as far as attentiveness. The ambiance is classy and comfortable - TV in the private room and the bar area. The food (had a pre-determined menu w/a party of 20), was great - surf and turf and not a complaint to be had. Wine list is better than most as well and the desserts were enjoyable as well - creme brulee and chocolate mousse cake had people collectivley saying \"mmmmm\".   The people watching alone at the bar (they have a great happy hour - check out thier website) was worth the price of admission. People w/way too much money and time who can sit there and drink and eat enough to easily throw down $100 per person just cause its a Tuesday - remarkable! The restrooms have that peek-a-boo thing going between the mens and ladies rooms - adding an extra conversation piece when you get back to your table.   I'd say its a solid go-to for a nicer than normal dinner out in the swank hood of Scottsdale. I'd go again for the happy hour for sure."}
{"text":"We went last night, first time! found the prices on the  high side for Arizona, we had to wait well beyond our reservation time, and I had to go to the hostess, I believe that they had forgotten about us. We ordered the seafood tower and that should have been sufficient as we had bread and butter at the bar with a couple drinks. Our Main course was the Chilean Sea Bass, and Grouper, the Sea Bass was awesome, the disappointment was in the Grouper dish, we strongly feel that we were served Red Snapper, we have a lot of experience in fish dishes, we often buy fresh Grouper and cook it at home in Calgary, what we had was not Grouper,the texture, firmness, and type of consistency of the fish was more similar to Red Snapper which is 1/3rd of the price. We may go back to the Lounge for drinks and appetizers but probably not for a full Dinner."}
{"text":"We love Eddie Vs and come here often for seafood. Always a great experience, atmosphere, service, and food and drink."}
{"text":"Ambience: 5 stars Service: 5 stars Food: 4 stars  Overall experience (as much as I can remember after endless bottles of fabulous wine): 4.5 stars   We were here celebrating a colleague's birthday during a business trip. We ordered a seafood tower which was my favorite of the night. It came with a lobster, oysters, crab meat, prawns, etc. I ordered steamed Chilean sea bass topped with julienned ginger in a light soy broth with a side of crab fried rice. The sea bass was so delicate and perfectly cooked medium rare. My friend's steak was very flavorful, tender and juicy. I really didn't care for the fried rice with cheese mixed in, which gave the fried rice a strange texture.   After several bottles of fabulous wine, we ended up getting the desserts to go.   Great ambience and decor (especially the bathroom), highly recommended on a special night while in town."}
{"text":"What a delightful addition to the Pittsburgh dining scene. The restaurant with much appreciated valet parking is beautiful in an subtle way. We were placed in a semi private room with a table for four. The live music was wonderful. Live music is hard to find and its volume still allowed for conversation. In a place such as this the absence of butter knives seemed strange. The bread and butter very tasty. The menu is fish centric with perfectly done ahi tuna and a Parmesan sole. The portions are more than adequate and the sides, especially the rice and the asparagus were well executed and not just filler. Our waiter Michael was warm, informative and very professional. Sadly our bottle of white wine did not come with a cooler. Too full we passed on dessert. The prices are high but the quality of food, venue and service justify the price tag. We will return to enjoy the restaurant again."}
{"text":"Excellent service 10/10...great food and wine selection.  Lobster bisque 10/10; steak 8.5/10; crab stuffed shrimp 6/10 (shrimp was not all de-veined properly and there were crab shells and other non-edible parts), Godiva lava cake excellent 9.5/10."}
{"text":"Love Eddie V's Happy Hour  One critique: Hold the salt on the crab/corn chowder..."}
{"text":"This was the third time we have been to Eddie V's. This time for our anniversary dinner. We could not have hoped for a better dinner or a more enjoyable evening. Started with drinks and appetizers in the bar. Great oysters and drinks. Then moved into the dining room for our meal. The food was wonderful and the service was fantastic!  A very special evening!  Plan to make this our \"go to\" place for special occasions!"}
{"text":"High expectations as have been to Eddie V in Florida but failed to deliver on service, food and especially atmosphere.  May have been seated at the worst table in the restaurant in the bar area.  People leaning on dining table waiting for reservations, very loud.  Service was really spotty not filling water glasses clearing plates, etc.  Steak was dry and over cooked.  Waitstaff hit into back of chair at least 20 times.  Won't be back.  It's a shame wanted to love this place!  Management needs to do a much better job with crowd control."}
{"text":"We LOVE everything about this restaurant. From the oysters to the cocktails to the lively bar crowd to the jazz music. It gets busy, especially on the weekends, so I highly recommend making a reservation. Their regular menu is a tad pricey, but the food is always fantastic so it's well worth it. We caught the tail end of happy hour the other day which is a great deal so I recommend checking that out.  Eddie Vs is always at the top of our list when going out for a special occasion."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is awesome. You will get the fun and fine dinning experience, live music and really cool waitresses."}
{"text":"I was looking for a special place for our wedding anniversary and Eddie V's did not disappoint.  After taking advantage of the valet parking, we were greeted by the hostess and led to our table where they had spelled out the number of our anniversary in rose pedals on the table and also had a card signed by all the staff.  The atmosphere is very romantic, with excellent table seating, but it would also be fun to sit at the bar. There was a live jazz trio with a female singer performing which was nice, but not so loud that you couldn't have a conversation.  As for the food, it was delicious. We started out with oysters on the half shell and crab cakes. For our main course I had the filet mignon and my wife had the New York strip steak which came with a side of steamed vegetables. Because it was our anniversary, they brought us a complimentary dessert which was a piece of chocolate cake and they had written \"Happy Anniversary\" in drizzled chocolate on the cake.  For drinks, my wife had a cabernet and I had the Vesper martini aka James Bond style. We were very pleased with our selections.  This is definitely a great place to go if you're looking to spend a classy evening out on the town and receives my highest recommendation."}
{"text":"The service was great, but the food was only ok! Too expensive for what you received. The bread was worth the calories!   Swordfish had been frozen and portion was tiny."}
{"text":"Eddie V's was an awesome experience. My boyfriend and I had gone for NYE. I was recommended by several people. We did an early 5pm slot so we could go home and recoup before meeting friends later. We arrived early and were able to be sat immediately. We were greeted promptly when we walked in the door and we were offered to check our jackets. We decided to keep our jackets because we were still really cold.  Our server Mark was amazing. Really knowledgeable and friendly. Started us off with some champagne which was great. We had already looked over the menu at home and had made a few decisions. We listened to his recommendations. We decided on the crab cake appetizer, 12oz filet, 22oz lobster tail, crab fried rice, and lobster mashed potatoes. Everything was amazing. Mark said the side dishes were big told us to get the smaller portions. Honestly the food was amazing. The lobster tail was insanely big. We had enough food left over to have another meal later.  After dinner we were offered coffee and dessert. We got both. We shared the s'mores toffee and it was AMAZING. For the portion sizes the price justifies. Our waters/wine glasses were always full, everyone escorted you tables, bathrooms, etc. we got a great view of the kitchen.  I've worked in restaurants all my life. Watching these chefs create all these amazing meals so effortlessly was like watching an orchestra. It was really neat! Kudos for the great service and meal. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great place to dine and I enjoyed every mouth watering bite of my meal. They could work on the background noise issues. But meal was superb and I will return."}
{"text":"Awesome seafood. I didn't want seafood for a landlocked city but dang it was good. To got the wasabi tuna and it was the perfect amount of spice to tuna. Simply great."}
{"text":"Ate here at Eddie V's again last week and was phenomenal again  My party did multiple appetitizers including oysters, hamachi tar tar, and kung pao calamari, everything had flawless presentation and was amazing tasting   For my main dish I did scallops again, and they were amazing again, almost did the sea bass instead but scallops were great, entire meal was awesome  Very pricy but very worth it"}
{"text":"I have been waiting to try the new Eddie V's at Scottsdale Quarter after they closed the Eddie V's at DC Ranch last year. Well I was not surprised to find the place was packed, when you walk in the front door directly to your left is the oyster bar where I met executive chef Tom Harvey creating delicious appetizers like Ahi tuna tartare, colossal shrimp cocktails and New England Jonah crab claws.  Tom also let us samples some shrimp ceviche which was a perfect balance of citrus and shrimp and I noticed they have 3 sushi rolls on the menu as well. You must try the Maryland style all lump crab cake you will not be disappointed. If you decide to get the Kung Pao style calamari make sure you split it with a friend it is humongous the waiter used a fork lift and a crane just to place it on the table.  For your entrees I recommend the macadamia crusted butterfish, chilean sea bass steamed Hong Kong style or you can order it with an almond crust. If one of your dinner guest is not in the mood for seafood you will like the 8oz or the 12oz filet mignon, 14 oz. veal chop or the 16oz rack of lamb.  The service and the food here is astounding they have a live band a large bar area and valet parking what more can you ask for."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE X 1000.  This place lived up to all of our expectations and recommendations and I only wish I would have checked it out sooner.  We went on a crowded Saturday night with some friends and made sure to have reservations.  The staff was beyond nice and so friendly and the place was bananas packed.    The food was superb.  I mean, seriously great.  I ordered the Scallops with a light brown sugar sauce and asaparagus on the side.  The Bf ordered the 8oz filet mignon and the twice baked potato side.  We each ordered 2 drinks a piece, which, I have to say Eddie V's makes a damn good dirty martini and their blue cheese stuffed olives are to DIE for.    Then dessert...oh sweet sweet dessert.  The bananas' foster was undeniabley the best dessert I have ever had.  It comes out flaming and the ice cream (we got vanilla, I detest butter pecan ice cream) was perfect to the warm goo-ey-ness of the cake which was a little carmel like...there are no words to explain how amazing this dessert was.  All in all with 4 drinks, an app, 2 meals, 2 accompaniements and dessert with tip for under $200..yhis place is a no brainer."}
{"text":"My husband and I recently went to Happy Hour at this restaurant and what a wonderful experience it was!! I can't believe we had never dined here before as we eat at either the Quarter and Kierland Commons all the time.  The restaurant is very attractive and has an interesting layout. The night we were there it was packed with people and had a very eclectic feel to it, which we loved. The happy hour food was outstanding. I had the Blackened Fish Tacos, which were so good (I usually don't eat fish) and my husband had the Carpetbagger, which he really enjoyed. The happy hour wine was excellent!! Service was attentive and professional - unusual anymore. Halfway was through our meal a live jazz group started playing - very enjoyable and unusual for a weekday. Everything was very fairly priced.  We can't wait to return for dinner and we highly recommend Eddie V's!!"}
{"text":"I will admit it: sometimes I can be a bit of a jazz snob.  Unfortunately there are not many great places to see a decent live jazz show in this valley...But, I must say Eddie V's impressed me!    It all started off at Kierland Commons outdoor live music festival, then came the monsoon...What to do??  Still craving live music!  We asked around and Eddie V's was on the list.  We were all dressed in very casual summer clothes so it was a little awkward walking into such a nice restaurant looking like wet dogs, but the bartender made us feel right at home.  The band was on break and I have never been so happy I went on my 'Phoenix valley sucks for jazz' rant.  One of the band members was eves-dropping on our conversation LOL!  So, when the band started I was a little embarrassed...But, I think it amped them up a bit!  The band consisted of a drummer, pianist and an upright bassist.  After the set, my friend Jon thanked them and they chatted with us for a bit.  The pianist asked if it met my standard and said he had to keep it a bit more low key due to the fact it is fine dining, not a concert hall...which I recognize.  The bassist was a guest player from out of town (Austin) and you could tell they were having fun jamming.  The last set you could tell they took it up another notch, since the restaurant had cleared a bit.  It was so good 2 cute old couples started dancing and I think everybody was bopping to varying degrees in the room!    Our bartender was also fabulous.  She made all 3 of us some outstanding cocktails and she knew the menu well.  I opted for the calamari, which is unique with almost an Asian inspired twist...And it is HUGE!    Eddie V's started off as a last resort and ended up being a 3 hour adventure!  I will definitely be back here again.  They have jazz (not blues, Motown etc) every night!  You can't go wrong with great music, cocktails, service and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Love the ambiance and music.  Sat in the bar first and received first rate service.  This place knows how to take care of its guests.  Dinner was delish! Oysters and crab cake surpassed our expectations.  You can pass on the lobster bisque as it was only mediocre.  Scallops and swordfish were prepared perfectly. Wonderful evening overall."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in town. I made a reservation on OpenTable (which The Resturant conveniently deleted after we left) for 7pm for three people. This was not for Mother's Day which apparently was the reason the other 100 people were waiting for tables, we had a Show to see at the Benedum. Arrived on time, and was told, we will see, we are behind, we will let you know. We waited 30 minutes to no avail, despite numerous conversations with different hostesses. The fact we are regulars and have spent hundreds at their bar meant nothing. The restaurant was pure chaos. We needed up walking down the street to the Capital Grille, who was also busy, but still had some semblance of order and were seated and finished within an hour, still making our show. I am beyond disappointed and u  ** Found our last night that both the manager and sommelier were purportedly fired after the Mothers day fiasco. Apparently the restaurant was hopelessly overbooked and the staff was totally overwhelmed with no support. Hopefully new management doesn't make the same mistake again."}
{"text":"We did the restaurant week and my husband reserved for 8:00. We got sat down at 8:25. Took an hour for our orders. Emma R was our waitress and damn she took everything so slow. We were suppose to have desserts but my husband literally walked to the back to ask for the check cause no one was paying attention and saw our waitress just texting. It's our anniversary btw and we didn't enjoy it. So disappointing."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went for the first time on this past Sunday. We heard lots of good things about Eddie V's but simply hadn't made it over to visit them yet. So glad we opted to go on Sunday night for dinner! They had live jazz music, stunning ambience, fabulous service, and the food was delicious! We decided to move with appetizer shared plates and chose three: first course was the crabcake, which is a great portion approximately 7 ounces and very well done. The next course were potstickers that were outstanding and not too salty. The final course were the lobster tacos-which are incredible-great portion and lots of amazing flavors!  As cocktails we shared Rombauer Chardonnay three glasses for him and three glasses for me which was very nice. We thoroughly enjoyed our evening and will go back again soon! I absolutely recommend Eddie V's and hope that you enjoy as much as we did!"}
{"text":"Under impressed with the food!  Service was excellent but they had nothing to work with. My sole was over battered and over cooked we had to send the veggies back. It was my birthday and they even managed to forget that when we ordered dessert. The banana fosters is to die for so I would recommend going only for dessert and a drink!  Tip big though cause the waiters are awesome!"}
{"text":"Was really looking forward to dinner at this restaurant as I have heard such good things. I was very disappointed. My favorite up until now has been Fleming's. Fleming's still wins hands down. Never mind the price which is very high. I don't mind paying but I expect excellent food. The only really good part was the dessert. Appetizer of shrimp salt and pepper was a 1 rating. The Brussel spouts was disgusting and the steak filet was only fair. Service was excellent. Sorry Eddie V's, would not recommend you and will not be back."}
{"text":"First time to Eddie V's, best seafood east of California. I will be back many times. Not many seafood restaurants receive their products six times a week in this market. The ambiance is fantastic as is the service and the live music!"}
{"text":"We checked Yelp and found a great spot for dinner.  Service was 5 STARS and food was fantastic.  My husband's halibut was slightly overcooked and they had a new one right back out in minutes.  They checked back with us and were very gracious.  We were happy we selected Eddie V's for dinner."}
{"text":"Fantastic Restaurant, The food and people who work there are great!!!!!"}
{"text":"I took my mom there fir her birthday. As a server myself i can be quite critical.i found this place to be amazing.they had a birthday card on the table for her.staff not stuck up and didnt rush us.my mom enjoyed herself.so glad i went there.i had intended to get a steak but was so stuffed on appetizers me and my mom split scallops.thanks so much eddie v's! Ill be back"}
{"text":"I am a defiinite foodie.  My husband took me to this restaurant based on the Internet reviews, many of which were 5 star. I think that is more than deserved based on the food we ordered.  While enjoyed the meal, it was nothing memorable. The food was well prepared but the taste as just OK.  Nothing I would want to order again in particular.   I would give their the food is a B on the scale of A-F.  The ambiance is nice, but be careful of getting the table in the corner inside the room off to the right when you walk in the door because they keep the front door open and the wind blows right into that corner, which is annoying and causes your food to get cold.  The service was very good and we enjoyed our server.  Beware the portions are huge, on the Ruth's Chris style where your steak or fish is gigantic and the side dishes are even bigger.  We order one twice baked potato as our side and it was big enough to serve 6 people.  Personally, I find restaurants that serve these huge portions less appealing because the meal can appear overwhelming instead of delightful.  But that is just me.  If you are looking for huge portions, this might be the place for you.  It is very hard to find, tucked into a large shopping complex at the back.  You need to use valet or park in the large parking garage next door."}
{"text":"Went here on a Monday night with a group attending a conference... They were able to accommodate a large party on short notice...we changed from 8 to 14 at the door, and it wasn't a problem.  Service was fantastic: kudos to this place for hiring warm, knowledgeable, courteous staff.  The food was far better than I expected...as a life-long New Englander who has never lived more than 90 minutes from the ocean, I have high standards for seafood. This place met them and then some. We had an appetizer of calamari, shrimp, lobster, and some oysters, all really nice. I also enjoyed the creamy crab and corn chowder. But my entree, Alaskan halibut with morels, edamame, and smoked pork shank, blew me away. Perfectly cooked, tender, sweet fish with an amazing sauce.   I only had room for a few bites of the twice baked potatoes and the crab fried rice, but those were delicious as well. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Just wanted to truly thank Niko, Kat, Patrick and Brynn for each spending time with me tonight. P]  Had one of the best meal experiences I've had in a long long time. I travel for my job and all the staff at the Ritz highly recommended me visiting this new establishment.  I already thanked all of them for the fantastic recommendation.   The food was superb but more importantly to me was the staff. Very attentive to all details. They must go through some rigorous bootcamp process because each and everyone I encountered was customer focused and enjoyed their being there as much as I did.   Sorry if I forgot to mention anyone but I without question give them 10 stars.  Yes I realize it only goes up to 5!!!  Enjoy!!!!"}
{"text":"As good as it gets.  We ate here for a birthday celebration and we were taken away by the great food and service (as usual).  We requested the V Lounge and were given a nice corner booth.  When we sat down there was a birthday card signed by the employees of the restaurant -- a very nice touch.  For appetizers, we had oysters and the (best) crab cakes (anywhere).  Steaks and seafood as our main courses paired well with the red cabernet wine.  Overall, just incredible.  Completely up to par with Eddie V's standards -- comparing to Houston and Austin.  My mom forgot her sweater at the booth and a hostess ran out to give it to her.  We also got a follow-up phone call the next day asking how everything went.  For those special occasions or a fun happy hour, Eddie V's never lets you down!  Also, their Banana's Foster is divine!  Save room for it or just stuff your face and go to the gym the next day -- delish!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem! Staff was great and the waitress's recommendation on the tempura tuna was a home run. The drink selection and wine selection was exceptional. Top restaurant downtown in my opinion,can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. The service is impeccable & our server was right there with everything we needed. And now the food. With the three of us, we all got something different, appetizers, main courses & side dishes. All outstanding. Couldn't handle desserts. I'm in a food coma as it is. Calamari & enormous Gulf shrimp; Ahi Tuna, the special, medallions of beef topped with crab on a layer of asparagus. My husband had something that involved many very large shrimp. I loved my Italian Margarita served in a martini glass (made me feel very adult). Great service, fantastic food...a very special place."}
{"text":"We have dined at here at V's since they were in DC Ranch.  This includes a few times at their La Jolla restaurant.  We dined last weekend on the 13th and came early at 5pm as they had over 200 people coming to dine that evening.  While we like to dine in their Bar, we opted for the dining room as we had guests. A waiter (Frank?) immediately checked in and my wife asked him to overview V's offerings. First mistake.  He waxed poetically about anything he could on the wine list and sizable menu and never once did any discovery with us about what we might be interested in.  This should be Rule #1 in Sales!!!  For instance, he detailed all the beef highlights (we do not eat meat) as we actually came there for the seafood. Talk about pre mature advocation.  He also mentioned that they had been working on quality control at their La Jolla restaurant as we had seen quality all over the board there as well. \"Not here in Scottsdale though\"  We ended up changing tables as he was non stop, left us feeling uncomfortable knowing he was lurking.  One has to wonder why he has been at sooo many Valley restaurants.  Yet the morale of this story is that V's quality may not fit either the high end ambiance or the pricing.  The Lobster Taco appetizer used to be amazing here and that night this was rubbery and the portion (for $18.00) has turned sadly smallish.  A side of beets had to be returned as these seem liked they may have been pre cooked and then put in a microwave. Chewy at best.  Of course, the Staff can always be a huge asset and the Team concept of service was exemplary.  Yet one has to wonder if  V's quality blips are Companywide in as much as La Jolla had/has issues.  They are big in Texas and we have not yet dined there.  In the end, it's summer here and V's can rock on any given night, yet quality issues will always trump the \"sizzle\" of  an establishment over time.  They will surely figure this out and we will return next month for a nice night.  We will just avoid Mr. pre mature advocator, that's all!!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for delicious food, creative cocktails, and a vast wine selection, and live music; this is the place for you!  Pittsburgh has a lot of steak and seafood restaurants now, but this is the newest and nicest.   I've been to this location three times, and I've tried something different each visit.   Usually, I'm having seafood, and the menu has so many items from which to choose. The lobster tacos are a must, but you If want to mix it up, try the steak and lobster tartar for the best of both worlds. Crab cakes are mouthwatering and are quite sizable. You won't be disappointed.  Be sure and ask for Larry; he's knowledgeable and super friendly. He goes out of his way to ensure a superb dining experience!"}
{"text":"The dining experience and the consistency of the food isn't what it use to be. They use to give you a really nice generous pour on the drinks. The Mac and Cheese lacked in enough truffles to really make a difference. The Caprese Salad, lacked enough cheese to go with the tomatoes. Lobster you can't beat, but it's not worth the big $$$$$ if the consistency isn't going to remain the same, this is the second time I've been here, where the food was mediocre, but if you're planning a special occasion, don't waste your time. They don't acknowledge birthdays, anniversaries like they use too."}
{"text":"After a few suggestions from friends and co-workers, I decided to try this place out for my two year anniversary.  We called to make a reservation for dinner.  After our arrival and pleasant check in, the hostesses took us to our table which was decorated with rose petals.  A+ y'all!  I was surprised by this thoughtful act.  Our waiter, Bill, was extremely pleasant and knowledgeable about the menu and how Eddie's V prepares their food.    Eddie V's has a solid menu with multiple seafood options that will make a seafood lovers mouth water.  So we order our food: Scottish Salmon, Jumbo gulf pawns, broccolini, and the twice baked potato.  All was good but the broccolini, which was blanded and tasteless.    Okay, overall the experience was good.  Great food.  Solid ambience!  Good service!  Thank you Eddie V's for a wonderful experience.  Shout out to Bill for such wonderful service."}
{"text":"Service was good, but if you think the food is worth the price then your nuts.. I can name 5 other places way better for the same price. This is just a place for a  wannabe high roller.. Save your money and go to Wildfish or better yet is Steak 44 if your looking for seafood or a good steak. They are cheaper and better quality. These people leaving 5 star reviews are either drunk, mental, or just crazy..The chicken was overcooked, twice baked potato was room temp and wouldn't even melt butter, wifes Sol Fish was less then 1/4 \" think counting the breading and tasted fishy. On top of the wait to get seated and  the long wait for the food I was very dissapointed. This is not professional     chef quality food, I would bet food is prepared by just a guy off the street with some  Dennys experience. As a resturant claiming top quality you should be ashamed to charge these prices for the quality of food your delivering.  Don't believe me then go try it for yourself.. Your deserts are very good if that helps."}
{"text":"Had an amazing experience at Eddie V's Sunday night. Brian was our server. We started off with a gigantic crab cake and a half dozen oysters. We let Brian choose the type of oysters, delicious! We shared a wedge salad. The chef split the salad for us so there was no fighting. My sister and I are twins and have been sharing  since we were fetus's, so this was a nice touch. We ordered martinis, they came out quick and very cold. With dinner we decided on a bottle of Duckhorn Merlot. Dinner was not disappointing. I had the 8oz filet carpetbagger style (fried oysters and bearnaise). That won't be the last time I do that for sure. My sister had the surf and turf special. Filet medallion with shrimp, fantastic. For our side dishes we had lobster mashed potatoes and sautéed spinach . Dessert  .... hot chocolate Godiva cake and an espresso martini, heavenly. Brian was so good to us. He anticipated all of our needs and clearly had extensive knowledge about everything Eddie V's had to offer and it helped he was easy on the eyes:)  So, way to go Eddie V's!!!! It was terrific!"}
{"text":"I booked Eddie V's for my wife and I to celebrate our 24th wedding anniversary. The reservation process was smooth and even received a call the day of our dinner to confirm. When we arrived at the restaurant we were nicely greeted and taken into a dining room with a cozy booth next to the glass wine bottle display.  Our server was Daniella, she introduced herself to us and explained the staff had hand signed an anniversary card for us and another nice young man came and placed rose petals on our table signifying our special day. Wow what a start, its the little things that make people come back. Very classy move Eddie V's. Cocktails were well made and the wine we selected was wonderful. Dinner was excellent, we had salads to start and then we went straight to the steaks with brussels sprouts on the side. We finished off dinner with the butter cake. This was defiantly one of the most amazing deserts we have ever had. Service as we all know can make or break a meal. The food at Eddie V's was great but it was made exceptional because of the warm service we received from Daniella. Thanks again for a great memorable meal and excellent service from Daniella. She rocks!"}
{"text":"The food is good, the atmosphere is good. Lively crowd and live entertainment. We have always dined in the lounge and the service was impeccable. Last night, it was poor. I think they were understaffed. Dirty dishes and utensils piled up. Refills were scarce, and the guy who was responsible for these things had an attitude. We waited a long time for everything. Finally after waiting 20 minutes to pay, I had to find the waitress and give our card to her. I'm sure service is better in the dining room. It took us 3 hours to complete our meal."}
{"text":"The best food I've had in awhile.  The calamari appetizer was so flavorful light and delicious could eat every day.   I had the tomato salad was so good and filling had to take rest of what I ordered home.  I also ordered seafood fried rice and southwest corn both delicious and great leftovers next day.  Service was GREAT.   It is well worth the price just visiting and still want to go again before leaving."}
{"text":"Beware of thieves! We were at the bar three weeks ago on Sunday and it was near closing time; there was just one couple on the other side of the bar. We frequent the bar so we knew the barista was not the usual guy we like very much.   I hung my purse on one of the hooks and had two cosmos which very uncharacteristically made me very woozy. I was focused on getting up and walking when we left and forgot my purse on the hook  I called the restaurant to tell them and to ask if they had found it; they were very unhelpful and the lady manager had an attitude when I tried to talk to her. It is unlikely that any customers found my bag since there weren't any around. I was very disappointed with their treatment of me and the fact that they made no effort to recover my handbag"}
{"text":"We had a fantastic experience. Three of us dined and everyone was delighted with their meal. From the well mixed beverages straight through to the Banana's Foster for dessert, each course delivered on flavor and presentation. A relaxing jazz band played in the bar and could be enjoyed from the main dining room. Servers were knowledgeable and friendly. Our waiter made excellent recommendations. We enjoyed three seafood meals and the battered oyster appetizer along with the Fuji Apple Salad. Next time we will add some sides to the main course."}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times.  Always a pleasant experience.   Last year, my husband and I took my parents here for there 56 year anniversary and they put rose petals on the table and served us delicious food and the service was outstanding.  My parents raved about the restaurant to everyone for weeks.     Most recently, my husband and I were there for restaurant week.  We received the same great service as we have in past visits.   The food was delicious as always.  We were unsure about our wine selection, and the waiter offered us a taste of each option before making our final selection. This restaurant knows how to deliver. Great ambiance, not to loud, romantic.  Also, the bar is nice if you want to go for drinks and to listen to music. I think the music starts at 7.  On their web site, it shows whose going to be playing.  Worth a trip just for the music and nice glass of wine."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Eddie V's last night for our anniversary. When we arrived they had made a special table for us with rose petals a nice card. This was a great touch. I was disappointed that the hostess had seated families with babies next to us in the dining room. Our server was very attentive. His name was Rick and he gave us great service all night. Overall  the food was just marginal.  Nothing really blew us away. The common theme was that everything seemed under seasoned. The crab cake appetizer was very good. It had large chunks of crab and not a lot of filler. I ordered the BLT salad as my second course. Please note that the salad comes as an iceberg wedge. You have to cut it up and make it yourself.  I have never liked the whole wedge thing. If I knew it beforehand I would not have ordered it. My wife had the lobster bisque. We both felt that it was under seasoned and it didn't have a lot of lobster. For main courses my wife had the halibut and I had a filet Oscar style. The hollandaise that came with this filet was absolutely fantastic. it was the highlight of the evening and that isn't saying much. Steak and fish were cooked to the right temps, but just didn't have enough seasoning. Just some more salt would have made all the difference. The truffle mac and cheese was no different. It was just pasta with little flavor at all. I couldn't tell what kind of cheese it was never mind taste any truffle. Service was 5 stars. Rick was a pro. Ambiance was 3 because of screaming babies in the main dining room. This is unnacceptabe for fine dining. Food was a 3 at best.  Try Michael Dominick's just down the road. For a little bit more money you'll get twice the value."}
{"text":"Had a couple of days in Pittsburgh and past by this place.  It is a real class act.  Great staff in a wonderful setting and fantastic food.  We really enjoyed our night of decadence."}
{"text":"Great service, great food!!!  Cant say enough good things about this place. They have a nice bar area, with music each night and a happy hour from 4-7p. It can be a loud place so if thats not your thing you may want to skip it.  Dining room wasnt as loud and we were able to enjoy the music from the bar in the distance. We ordered fresh oysters first, then had crispy shrimp and lobster bisque both of which were very good, the shrimp had a nice crunch and slightly spicy. For dinner it was a Chilean Sea Bass and the Florida Grouper, OMG the serving size of the sea bass was incredible and it was cooked to perfection in an amazing soy broth that I could just drink up!  The grouper also cooked perfectly and was just as delicious.  Dessert was the butter cake with bananas flambe and a fresh raspberry sorbet with homemade cookies, the sorbet was great but had a ton of seeds which was a slight turn off. The peanut butter cookies were amazingly light and delicious.  The butter cake is very sweet and should be shared!"}
{"text":"AMAZING food, service, atmosphere and quality- wish I could eat there all the time!"}
{"text":"We made reservations for a holiday company dinner here a few weeks ago. It was truly an amazing dining experience!    FANTASTIC service!  The appetizers were served fresh and ever so yummy.  I had the scallops and ohmygawd goodness!    It was just a very on point experience.  Everyone made sure you had everything you needed.    It's a must try/bucket list thing to do!"}
{"text":"i brought some visiting guests here for dinner one night to celebrate an early new year.  they are visitors from OC, so i knew it would be difficult to impress them... but with eddie v's, i was successful!  this place has great live music, a fantastic menu, impeccable service, and an overall fun and classy ambience.  we will be dining here again. i recommend trying the chilean sea bass, hong kong style and the truffle mac and cheese.  this is a phenomenal restaurant -- do yourself a favor and dine here!"}
{"text":"Two words: African lobster.  I didn't know it was a thing but it is and you need to find it as soon as possible.  It was a special and I don't know how long they'll have it but it's worth asking before you go.  The husband, who thinks lobsters are disgusting sea roaches, even liked it.  Drinks and service were excellent.    We arrived early with plans to have a drink at bar before our reservation.  Unfortunately, the bar was full and they were kind enough to seat us a bit early so we could get started on cocktails.    The brussel sprouts are delicious as were the desserts.    Parking at the Scottsdale Quarter is pretty much a nightmare all the time so make life easy and plan to valet.    We were seated in the \"room\" just off the bar and at times, the band was way too loud.  It was difficult to have a conversation."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere. The food was super delicious. The service was great , despite of it being so busy on a Saturday night.  For starter crab cake!!! My butter cod was really good also truffle mack and cheese was Delicious .  The little flames that come with butter cake are a nice addition of WOW to end with !"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is dark and sexy and the service was on par with my expectations. I ordered filet mignon w/ congnac sauce. My friend ordered bone-in rib eye. We shared the sauteed corn and a side of roasted brussel sprouts. Everything was delicious...I will definitely return again soon."}
{"text":"This is our first time visiting the new location. We took my Mom for her birthday. The hostess gave her a birthday card signed by some of the staff which was very nice. We took advantage of restaurant week and each ordered our appetizers.  Mine and my Mom's came out first, yet my husbands took forever. I was already done with mine by the time his came out and the waitress didn't even apologize. That was disappointing. The rest of our meal was good- not amazing, but good. The desserts were AMAZING though- SO good! We had the chocolate lava cake, the banana foster and the creme brulee.  They were huge portions.   I have to mention that the bathrooms were also pretty cool.  Gotta check them out.  All in all, the best thing about our dining experience was the dessert and the restrooms.  Not sure that's worth a hefty bill, but might be worth revisiting for happy hour."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant.  Excellent food. Great service!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is for sure one of our faves! They are consistent in everything they do! From the food to the fabulous service, especialy from our favorite server, Dona who always pays attention to every details, right down to remembering to which wine we had the last tme we were there! Don't miss this lovely spot, especially if you are a visitor. It never disappoints! Also, it has live music, which is a nice addition to your evening. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Delicious. Great place for date night. Romantic. Live music was fantastic.  Get the Crab Cakes!!! Everyone should come here at least once..."}
{"text":"This is our favorite restaurant in the city. Everything about it is perfect, from the beautiful, decor to the amazing display selection of the whiskey bar and most of all, the FOOD.  We came here for Valentine's Day, not that we ever have trouble finding an excuse to come here.   Our waitress was extremely attentive, always refilling water and making sure we were ok. The Cocktails are stong and delicious and we will certainly be coming back!"}
{"text":"Amazing service and food. Better than Mastro's Ocean Club and Orange Sky, right up there with Salt Cellar. Igor was a great server!  We went for my wife's birthday, she had the Swordfish. It was very good. I had the filet medallions with shrimp scampi. The medallions we're great, but the shrimp was amazing!  Next time will get the Scallops because the shrimp was so good. We shared au gratin potatoes, they were excellent, both had Bananas Foster for dessert, it was good too. The ceaser salad was probably the best I have ever had. My wife had the lobster bisque, she was very pleased with it."}
{"text":"What can I say?  Just see my review for Bourbon Steak as it applies here as well.  Hasta luego."}
{"text":"We dined at Eddie V's last week and had an excellent experience.  The décor, service, and food were all outstanding.  Our waiter's name was Bill and he was attentive without being overbearing or a pest. We had grouper and a NY strip and were very pleased.  For dessert we shared the warm blackberry crisp with vanilla ice cream on top and it was delicious. Live music added to the ambience but wasn't too loud."}
{"text":"Had a nice vibe as soon as I walked in.  Tastefully decorated.  Friendly and attentive staff.  Our waiter reminded us of Franc from the movie \"The Wedding Planner\".  A little over the top he gave us a chuckle but was very helpful with recommendations.    My only complaint is the live jazz music was entirely too loud.  Needs to be toned down a bit more like background music it's a nice touch but I'm not there for a concert.  Could not have a conversation in the bar.  If you want to have a nice meal & conversation I recommend making reservations on the dining room side.  I'm sure you would still hear the music but be able to hear each other as well.  I don't enjoy shouting and saying \"what?\"every other word.  Food was very good but the only thing I can say really stood out was my drink.  I think it was called \"Hope Diamond\".  On menu under \"24 Carat\" drink. Delicious & highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and outstanding service.  Pricey and upscale, but definitely worth it for special occasions.  Start off with appetizers like Pot Stickers (some of the best I've ever had) or Lobster & Shrimp Bisque, followed by main courses featuring filet mignon or seafood.  A very memorable dessert on our last visit was the Bananas Foster Cake, whose topping was lit in a pitcher, and then poured onto the cake as a streaming flame- Wow!  Wine selection is extensive.  You definitely won't leave hungry."}
{"text":"I had dinner here a few months back after Eddie V's first opened.  The place is spectacular on the inside.  The glass enclosed wine room is the centerpiece and is quite beautiful.  No expense was spared on the decor and furniture.  The bar had live jazz music and the dining room was bustling with activity.  We started with the Shellfish Tower which reminded me quite a bit of the Ocean Club Seafood Tower.  I had the Pacific Ahi Tuna as my main course.  It was delicious!  The seafood was top quality and the presentation made it even more special.  The service was good although there were some issues with the availability of wine from the wine list.  The experience was memorable and also expensive for my date.  If you dine here, be prepared to open your wallet.  A nice place to take a date if you want to impress them."}
{"text":"My first time here and while it wasn't perfect, the service and food more than made up for it.  Check it...  The Situation: A week prior I made a reservation on Open Table for the wrong date.  Problem is that I didn't realize this until I arrived.  When I checked in at the desk, they asked for my name and said it would be a couple minutes longer because they were a little behind on reservations.  After waiting for about 25 minutes, I went back up to the hostess stand and inquired on how much longer the wait would be.  At that point, another host checked the computer and advised that she didn't see my reservation.  When I checked the confirmation in my email, I realized my error and explained what happened.  The hostess told me not to worry and they would still accommodate us.  Talk about major save.  I truly appreciated them not only for fitting us in but being friendly and professional during the whole thing. Pretty cool.   Ambiance: We were seated by the bar which was kind of loud at one point but died down once more people disbursed and were seated.  The room was beautiful and spacious with a sexy vibe.  It was a Friday night and there was live music and we sang along to songs like Marvin Gaye's, \"What's going on\". We sat at a high top and had a good view of the bar, TVs and the musicians.   Food:  The lobster bisque was ok.  I have had better but they do make up for it with the huge chunk of claw meat in the middle of the bowl. The crouton or cracker in the middle taste like a homemade ritz cracker, very buttery.   Filet mignon was butter soft and cooked perfectly but did lack a bit of seasoning.  The sauce did help to add additional flavor however and when eaten together were perfect. The accompanying asparagus were ho hum ok.  I mean they were very tiny, some of the tips charred and bitter.  Not a big deal.  The grilled shrimp on top were huge and cooked to perfection. I mean those suckers bursts in my mouth and were so juicy and flavorful.  Yum!  Crab stuffed shrimp were good and the crab mixture had very little, if any, filler.  Again, shrimp cooked perfectly.  The side of au gratin potatoes were very rich and delicately seasoned with garlic and cheese, browned perfectly.  The bananas foster butter cake...there's no words.  The fun is in the added visual of the flambe when it's brought to the table.  My first bite was full of rum and I could've sworn there was a bunch of alcohol left.  Lol  Think rum cake, butter, bananas and caramel with a side of butter pecan ice cream and real whipped cream.  That thing was something dreams are made of.  I mean damn.   Lastly, is this place expensive? Hecks yeah, but it's not an everyday type of place.  This place is special, some place you go to celebrate, even if you're just celebrating that it's the weekend :)"}
{"text":"I booked a business dinner with our bank owners at Eddie V's, in one of their semi-private spaces.  There was nothing but great things said about the restaurant, the food especially, and the service.  Each of our guests had flown in for the meeting, and it really is important for them to have a great dinner to show our appreciation.    Thank you so much Eddie V's for making this a seamless and positive experience for me and our guests.  Much appreciated.  I will definitely book another dinner with you.    Thank you!"}
{"text":"After visiting Eddie V's for the first time last night, Eddie V's should receive a Michelin Star for their outstanding staff and quality of food served in the restaurant but most especially at the bar. Phenomenal cocktail engineer, Mariah, took special care for not only my girlfriend and I, but also about 40 other guests at the same time. She made what looks to be a very stressful environment, into a beautiful dance highlighted by the amazing live jazz band playing in the background. The entire staff were the most kind, gracious, friendly and helpful people I have experienced in a Charlotte restaurant. From the hostess walking me to the restroom instead of giving general directions, to the server asking how my day has been (while holding a full tray of food) this first time experience was the BEST dining experience I've had this year! We will be regulars at Eddie V's, every Tuesdays!"}
{"text":"Well we went for restaurant week and in my opinion treated just as such. Seated 30+mins late with a reservation, once seated it took so long to get a glass of water I was tempted to get a pitcher and pour it myself. Was looking forward to the filet medallions or 8 oz filet but both were sold out along with the 12oz filet. We ordered a dozen oysters and one option on the menu was sold out but the alternative was delicious. My husband ordered the Crispy Salt and Pepper Shrimp which were good but the sauce tasted very asian generic and kinda ruined the delicious scrimp. For our main course we had the Parmesan Sole and the Jumbo Gulf Shrimp both were very tasty. I ordered the shrimp since all of the filets were not and option and most of the seafood had a sweet or asian influence. For dessert once again they were out of what we were looking forward to, \"Bananas Foster\" Butter Cake with butter pecan ice cream but the waiter did say we could choose any dessert in its place which was very nice. My husband ordered the Hot Apple Cobbler which was more like a pie with burn crust and I got the Hot Chocolate Godiva Cake that to me was nothing special. We also had a glass of port with dinner that arrived in a very sticky glass. The desserts took a long time to come out and our waiter did comp the port as an apology for how long the desserts took, which was very nice of him. When we got our coats from the coat check the girl asked us how everything was an I was honest and said we were a bit disappointed as two things we came for were not available. A gentleman who works here gave my husband a card for a complimentary Bananas Foster Butter Cake which was a really nice gesture. All in all I think we should have not come during Restaurant Week because they were too overwhelmed and it ruined our first and probably last visit here. I appropriated the comps they gave us but at the end of the day if I am spending $200+ on a dinner I want to be happy when I leave. I understand the majority of the tables may have been spending more than us but I work hard and when we treat ourselves I want it to be a good experience and feel worth it rather than let down.  The food & service are good but during a busy time you may be underwhelmed."}
{"text":"Wow. This place is over the top good. No need to talk about every dish. They were all amazing.  Very pricey but well worth the experience. Recommended."}
{"text":"Upscale and elegant. The bar area was packed. I stood for a while before landing a seat.  The shrimp entree was hearty and the Ketel one and cran was just what I needed after a long day.  Live entertainment to help you unwind!  All the staff was pleasant and attentive. Valet parking available."}
{"text":"Great fresh seafood spot located in the Scottsdale Quarter. Enjoying a nice dinner out and felt like seafood so we decided on this restaurant. We were greeted and taken to our seat right away. The restaurant sets a more professional, upscale type atmosphere.  We were greeted by our server and he took our drink order. We started with the seafood platter which had shrimp, oysters, lobster tails and a crab mix. Love seafood? Get this for sure! The oysters were quite large and not amongst the freshest I've ever had but they were still good.   For dinner we enjoyed the chicken and the scallops with a side if crab fried rice. Crab fries rice was full of flavor and really good! Scallops had a citrus flavor added which made it even more tasty.   Service was above par as well. Our server was attentive and friendly.   I'd go back if I wanted a nice night out and craved some seafood"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service! The oysters are fabulous! We had the swordfish and Mediterranean branzino and it were extremely pleased! Our server Mark went out of his way to make suggestions on the menu and the wine list! I cannot say enough about this place!"}
{"text":"We just had a rehearsal dinner here in a private room.  Everything was top rate, the food and service were outstanding.  We highly recommend this venue for anyone looking for a good place for a small dinner party or a large group.    It was on a Friday night, the restaurant was filled, and music was low enough to enjoy the conversation."}
{"text":"This just became my new favorite seafood place! Had Crab Cakes, Caesar Salad, Scallops, Truffled Mac & Cheese, Crab Fried Rice, and Banana Fosters! All exceeded my expectations!"}
{"text":"So 4 of us came in around 4:20 the place was empty except for a female hostess and what looked to be a male manager.  Neither greeted us as something on their computer was definitely more important.  We entered the dark bar and the two bartenders turned around and faces were giving the impression that they weren't looking forward to working tonight.  We asked if we could take a bar table as they all had reserved signs on them ... they said we would have to ask the hostess ... oh ok ... so we went back to the front and asked if we could sit at a bar table the manager and hostess said yes and then proceeded to look at there computer for the answer.  4 minutes went by and we decided to head to Dominicks which was fantastic and service was outstanding ... good luck to anyone else."}
{"text":"I've been hearing good things about Eddie V's, and after tonight, it definitely did not disappoint ! We made a reservation for a party of four to celebrate our friends' anniversary. Upon arrival, we told them that we were interested in the happy hour menu, so they set up another table in their lounge/bar area with no problems. I was glad that we decided to eat in that area, because we were later greeted by the evening's entertainment. I loved the ambience of the restaurant and the live music that Eddie Vs has everyday was the cherry on top of the icing. The food did not fall far from the tree. From the happy hour menu we ordered:  1. Calamari - it was a generous portion. It came with cashews, julienned carrots, rice noodles, and a kung Pao like sauce. The server warned us that the chili peppers within the dish were quite hot. My boyfriend decided to be the tough guy so he tried it regardless. Let's just say the spot on his tongue burned for quite awhile, but he denied the milk they offered. The calamari was flavored really well and was not chewy. The batter, although topped with sauce, still remained quite crunchy. I would definitely recommend this dish!   2. Crab cake - we were told that these were the best crab cakes ever. Although it was good, it lacked a little bit of flavor for me, despite the sauce that it came with.  3. Ahi Tuna tartare - this dish came with sesame rice chips. The cubes of tuna tasted very refreshing and paired well with the avocado and mango pieces.  4. Market oysters - Kumamoto oysters on half shell was quite good. They tasted fresh and came with cocktail sauce, horse radish, lemon, and a house sauce.   5. Batterfried oysters - Gulf oysters dipped in batter and fried to perfection. The sauce that came with the oysters gave them a lot of flavor. The oysters were quite meaty.  6. Lobster tacos - 2 tacos per dish. probably my favorite dish here besides the dessert. I would come back specifically for this dish. Although the tacos were slightly on the smaller side, it was well worth the money. Every bite was evenly dispersed in flavor and the lobster pieces were large enough for me to enjoy the texture.   7. Banana foster butter cake with butter pecan Icecream - the presentation of the dessert was as amazing as the taste. The server lit the rum on fire and drizzled it on top of the butter cake and allowed the fire to burn off the rum leaving a crisp layer on top of the slices of banana and cake. I loved the various textures of the cake. The outside was crisp and crunchy and the inside still remained moist. All together, it was wonderful and I would definitely recommend ordering it to end your meal. Although the butter pecan Icecream was good, I think I would have liked if it were paired with vanilla instead to complement yet not overpower the taste of the banana foster cake.   Can't wait to return again !"}
{"text":"Wow. My wife and I are diehard foodies. We now wish everyday was an Eddie V's day. This place was awesome. It exceeded every expectation. We used to go to Ocean Club weekly but we have converted to Eddie V's. they don't pack you in like sardines as OC does. Service is better. Food is as good if not better. The bar is unbelievably comfortable and the live music is some of the best I've heard. Do yourself a favor and drop OC and come over to Eddie. The Banana Foster is a gift from the food gods."}
{"text":"Eddie V's is a great dinning experience.  Staff is friendly and professional.  I've done a few business meals here and it's always been a hit ; last night was no exception.    -Seafood Tower: lobster, crab meat, shrimp and oysters. Great appetizer.   -Salad: their version of the Caprese. No olive oil... So I had them bring it. Aged balsamic and basil together all worked great.    -main course: 12oz prime filet with side of Mac-cheese and broccolini sautéed. Steak was cooked perfect and amazing flavor."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service; wouldn't expect anything less. The crab fried rice is fantastic, a must get every time I go.  Happy hour is a good deal on their drinks and some food dishes.  On the north east side of Scottsdale Quarter, across from Kierland."}
{"text":"Went there for a business dinner. All of the meals were great, good wine list. The bananas foster dessert was amazing."}
{"text":"Everything about this place was 5 star worthy!!! The cocktail at the bar while we waited for our groups table to be ready was unique and delicious.    The amazing live Jazz made the ambiance unforgettable. My wife and I visited with a large group incl celebration of a few birthdays and I have to admit I'm a bit jealous that it wasn't my birthday! The wait staff was prompt and prestine, very knowledgeable of the menu and made amazing recommendations.   We probably ordered a third of the items on the extensive menu and EVERYTHING was delicious. Even the fresh and hot bread that came to the table was top notch.   Can't wait to make a trip back to this spot."}
{"text":"It was another sautrday night, and once again my wife and I find ourselves at Eddie V's with friends. We love Eddie V's for the fantastic food, but keep returning for the amazing service, which is provided by one of our favorite servers who left Donovan's to come to Eddie v's, which then forced us to follow (did not take much arm twisting, but we still love Donovan's as well).  We were seated at our normal table by the bar that accommodates 4-5 couples, and allows for a view of the band playing music that is loud enough to entertain, but not bother us during our evenings of conversation.   The food:  We started with 2 shellfish towers, which consist of 1 Maine lobster, 8shrimp, 8 oysters, jumbo lump crab + we added 15 more east coast oysters (nova scotia) -   You have to first understand that Eddie V's receives their seafood fresh daily from the boat to the plane to your plate (for the most part), so it is top quality. They do offer west coast Oysters, but they are never has delicious as the cold water east coast variety, so try one of each before ordering your tray, which they will accommodate.  Needless to say, everything served was top notch, and delicious and in some cases can serve as a meal in itself depending on your appetite for shellfish.   The 2nd portion of appetizers were 2 orders each of Pot stickers fIlled wIth Spicy shrimp and Pork In a light Soy broth & Steak and lobster tartare truffled Steak tartare and chilled fresh Maine lobster with toasted baguettes.   The pot stickers were tasty, but probably unnecessary, we only order them because some of us who get together regularly are not  fans of much that come on the shellfish tower. As far as pot stickers go, you probably wont find better, but I think they all taste the same no matter the establishment.  The Steak & Lobster tartare was really good, although, I only had one bit of the dish as to save room for dinner.   At this point we had been Eating & Drinking for about 3 hours, so we decided to move on to the main course of our dinner. I ordered the Cold water Maine lobster tails, which consist of two 9 oz tails  Steamed with drawn Butter and lemon. My wife opted for the 12 oz Center Cut Filet mignon medium. My tails were perfect. Perfectly cooked, perfectly sized, perfectly sweet.. just perfect. You really cannot be great lobster, and this was no let down. The wife's steak was awesome from the little taste I had. They have no need to season it, or have any need to put any sauces, etc.. as it is truly a fine cut of meat.   The table shared the following sides -   Broccolini witH lemon and garlic - This is a great side that I need to make at home  Brussels Sprouts, Bacon and Shallots - The bacon make this a must have  Sautéed monterrey Style Sweet Corn - was not a fan of this, but it was the first time I have ever tried it at Eddie V's. Perhaps i was too invested in other sides I regularly enjoy, but many at the table loved it.   Twice Baked Potato with Bacon and Chives - Pretty standard twice baked potato. Hard to mess up  Crab Fried rice witH Scallions & mushrooms - This is a must have for the table. In fact, I have ordered it as a appetizer before and almost did not have room for dinner.   truffled macaroni and cheese - My wife is obsessed with this dish and for good reason. The dish comes out bubbling on the inside and hotter than the sun with a nice bit of crust over the top.   Parmesan and Chive French Fries - Probably my favorite fries in the valley. I can eat the entire side for myself even though it is meant to share with 4  au gratin potatoes - Really good, but not something I enjoy regularly  Sugar snaps witH PortoBellos - did not even try these, but the table seemed to enjoy them.  Steamed asparagus - excellent  roasted Baby Beets and Candied walnuts - did not have a chance to try, but again was told they were great like other dishes I did not dip into  Sautéed spinach with garlic and parmesan - Very tasty, I love garlic, so you can put it on almost anything and receive a nod from me.   During the evening we went through about 6-7 bottles of the Layer Cake Malbec. It is a personal favorite of ours, and find it to be on point no matter where we order. We also had assorted house specialty martinis and they whipped up a few things that weren't on the menu, as any place of this caliber will to make sure you enjoy your evening.   If you Haven't been to Eddie v's, you must give it a try. You'll likely run in to a loud table I am sitting at."}
{"text":"Came in last night and ordered the $9 glass of \"The Crusher\" Pinot Noir. It was gummy and spoiled tasting - like it was from a 3-day opened bottle. She kindly hurried me out a replacement Pinot at a $12/glass price point (I forget the name - \"Glos\" something), and still wasn't impressed, though at least it wasn't terrible. They removed any wine charge from my bill, which was a classy move.   For food I ordered the shaved steak tartare with crostini, which was very good. It went well with the pinot. The ambiance is relaxed-upscale and elegant. Good place to impress your date. I haven't done the dinner for 2 thing here yet, so my assessment probably isn't fully informed.  I'll be back and update my review someday, I'm sure."}
{"text":"Been hearing all the hype about this place So me and my girlfriend wanted to give it a try. we got there and it was packed but we were seated relatively quick which that was good.  we ordered drinks and then after that waited about 7 to 8 minutes before even getting our first drink after that my girlfriend had to wait an additional 7 to 8 minutes for her wine so as a gentleman I didn't drink my beer because I wanted to wait for her.  My girlfriend had to remind the server about her wine so  he ran and got it. We ended up having to tell another server to take orders because our server disappeared for quite a while she was very nice. Our calamari  app came out and The flavor of the calamari was good maybe a little overcooked and I feel like it could use some of that sauce that comes with calamari at other restaurants otherwise no complaints. my Salad came out that was also good and then the entree came out.  we have been at the restaurant for about an hour and 20 minutes at this point into dinner when the entree came out.  My overall experience was not satisfying after spending $125 I would say that I won't recommend this to anybody if someone asked"}
{"text":"What a great overall experience. Service was fantastic. Food was worth the money. I had the bone in ribeye and it was one of the best steaks I have ever had. Just overall one of the best dining experiences I have had in a long time. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"I LOVE eddies !!! Our bartender Andrew is the best! That is the main reason me and my boyfriend came back. In addition the food is great and the drinks are too!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, menu, and wine list. Staff is friendly and helpful. Prompt service with a good cadence. Steak was above average. The seafood seemed to be more their suit."}
{"text":"We made reservations on open table for 2:15 p.m. on Easter Sunday.  We waited over 1/2 hour to be seated.  Others waited a long time too and some where offered champaign - not all - including myself and my party. Once seated things fell apart.  The waiter did not seem well trained. The food was not good.  The waiter did trade out my cocktail when I did not like the first drink. I feel that they may have been too busy to service the traffic that they received.  It was an upscale restaurant bill with bad service and food.  Will not be returning."}
{"text":"I ordered a steak with no side orders.  Food was good.  But the presentation was awful: a big white plate with a piece of meat in the middle.  It was almost as if they were punishing me for not having ordered anything else.  Ridiculous are ridiculous."}
{"text":"we made reservations for my 30th birthday celebration and we couldn't have gotten better service and food.  We were welcomed and seated right away and our server was absolutely fantastic. He was attentive and helpful with his favorites of meal and wine recommendations.  My parents, brother, and fiancee were all there, chose different meals and appetizers, and couldn't have been happier.  The steak literally melted in your mouth and every bite that I put into my mouth was delicious.  It's expensive, definitely expensive .... but for a special occasion? Worth every penny."}
{"text":"Easily one of my favorite spots in Scottsdale. Ordered the surf and turf tartar, easily one of the best I've ever had. The lobster was perfectly cooked and the quality of the tartar was on point."}
{"text":"Come here (any night of the week) if you're looking for live music and prefer a cool jazz tune.  After a rained out evening outdoor concert, a few of us decided we weren't ready to give up on an hearing some live music. We popped into a place around the corner hoping to find some live Jazz, and disappointed with who was playing that evening, we asked the bartender if there was somewhere else they would suggest for Jazz on a Sunday evening.  I'm glad we decided to take his advice on Eddie V's, cause I had one of the best evenings of great live Jazz in the Phoenix area sitting right at the bar. After some encouragement by our group, the musicians decided to really lay into it with their music and turn it up from the typical elevator music to something you could really dance along to.   The bartender poured some excellent tasting drinks, the band ended up chatting with us for a couple minutes post set and it turned out to be a fabulous way to spend four hours with your gal.  Happy Yelping Phoenix! :-)"}
{"text":"Eduardo is the best server. He always so attentive and professional. The food is consistently great.  We love the crab cake and calamari appetizers."}
{"text":"As people already mentioned, it's a very nice seafood place and they have the best crab cake I've ever had! What a strong statement, you'd say, but the deal is that I don't like crab cakes (my husband does ;)) and I tried tons of them at different places and this is the first one I liked a lot and will order again. We've been to this restaurant two times already and  had  pleasant experience.   Note: if they have extra big crab claws as their special appetizer, do not fall for it! They're not that big + they bring only 1 claw  and charge $25, which is ridiculous. My husband thought that he would get something amazing, but was disappointed. They had this \"special\" at least 2 weeks in a row.  Hint: you don't even have to call to make a reservation, just go to opentable, they have Eddie V's listed. If you want to go there on Friday or Saturday around 6-7, I would recommend making a reservation beforehand."}
{"text":"I would never eat here again.  You get cut off for ordering water at the bar.  Shame on you!!! You make a living on tips!  Good luck bar tending forever and love life as a hostess. Oh and the 25 year old manager  good luck with your employees and business.  NEVER frequent this restaurant!!! Most unprofessional place! I have never been treated so poorly!!!"}
{"text":"Will never set foot in this piss poor managed place ever again. And the countless people I entertain and know will be passed this message. To save me time and the countless people that read these reviews. THIIS PLACE ABSOLUTELY SUCKS!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place for the restaurant week and it was pretty good! The atmosphere is great and lovely beside the fact that sometimes it can get little noisy! The food was pretty good actually we tried crispy salt and pepper shrimp which was crispy and delicious just little spicy! We tried Main lobster bisque and it was amazing! Love how creamy and rich in flavor it was! For the main course we tried filet mignon which we ordered Medium Rare but it came rare actually! And the other main course was Mediterranean Branzino and I loved it! The portion was huge! Fish was full of flavor and the artichoke was cooked great! Talking about fish forgot to let you know that if you like seafood try yellowtail sashimi! It's fantastic! Loved it! Also desserts were great and lovely! Overall we had a good experience with food. Service could be better though! I know they work hard there but it's a fine dining restaurant and I believe they an improve the service in order to have a great experience. (When they deliver the yellowtail sashimi they sauce split on the table cloth). I would recommend this restaurant to friends. Just make sure you'll have a reservation."}
{"text":"This was one of the best steakhouses I've ever been to.  Although my husband and I both ordered seafood instead of steak, the seafood was excellent and very fresh.  The crab cake appetizer was the best I have ever had. What really made it fun was our waiter, Mike Muhamed.  He was funny and very knowledgable about the menu.  His recommendations were spot on.  I would go back there in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Eddie V's is probably the best  steak and seafood restaurant in Scottsdale.   Good wine list. Amazing oysters. Great sushi rolls. They can cook a steak. The side veggies are good too.  The decor and furniture are very classy.  Bring a date here if  you want to impress.  The band is awesome.  They are a talented trio.  Go Rebecca!  Check it out.  Eddie V's is at the North East corner of the Scottsdale Quarter."}
{"text":"What a nice suprise! We usually frequent Mastro's and we decided to give this place a try because we wanted a different vibe.  We heard they have jazz music at dinner and \"what a treat!\" The service was amazing the food was perfect We started with the calamari and it was done to perfection the sauce was amazing. We started with a salad unfortunately I wasn't thrilled with the vinegar dressing but \"who cares\" Because the steak and Brussels sprouts were divine. The lobster mash was the \"best\" ever and I have had a lot of lobster mash!!  We had salmon and other fish with no complaints. The dessert was also sooooo good we had the Godiva cake and the cookies and ice cream plus the berries and cream!! So good!!  Thank you for such a great experience and such good food!!"}
{"text":"Well, it was nice to finally try the new location after we've moved away. A little tricky getting into the center, parking or valet otherwise. Once in, we were able to go to the bar and grab a seat. Seems pretty typical like that last DC Ranch location...there was live music and of course attractive people. Good people watching. I would have to agree with Brent K about the music being a little loud. But whatevs. Drinks and apps were good. Next time we are in, we will have the entrees we miss...the filet and parmesan sole."}
{"text":"Had an amazing experience at Eddie V's. It was my 11th Anniversary and I had made a reservation at 8:15 at night. We had been at the ASU football game during the day and the game got out late so I had switched it to 8:45. Well, we got home quicker than I thought so we called and asked if we could come in at our original time which was 8:15 and they were more than willing to accommodate us. We got to the restaurant and our table had a beautiful setting with rose petals and a happy anniversary card signed by the entire staff.  My husband had a caesar salad to start off with and I had the corn crab chowder, both were amazing. When we received both of our steaks, our server asked us to cut into them to make sure they were cooked the right temperature.  My filet was cooked perfectly but my husband was overcooked. So they took the entire order back and gave us a new meal.  Again we had cut into our steaks, my husbands was cooked perfectly but mine was undercooked.  They took back my steak to cook it longer and brought it back and it still was undercooked.  I was fine having it the way it was.  Our server came back and looked at it with her flashlight and asked if it was okay and I told her it was fine she said \"you wouldn't tell me anyway would you?\"  I told her it was fine which it was and when they took our plates away she told me that they will be taking care of my meal because they couldn't get it cooked right.  Oh I forgot to mention that they gave me the first filet to take home in addition to my undercooked filet.  The manager came by and spoke with us as well and apologized for the steak inconvenience. We told her it was no problem and we were just enjoying the night.  Overall our experience was great we enjoyed the night and to top it off we had the Bananas Foster Cake which is to die for.  We are looking forward to coming back again and again to Eddie V's to enjoy the great food and outstanding service."}
{"text":"I had eaten at Eddie V's in CA and it was hands down one of the best meals I've ever had so I was so excited when they opened one in Pittsburgh. My boyfriend took me here for my birthday on Friday (the 22nd). Unfortunately the food did not come close to the experience I previously had but the waiter and manager more than made up for it. I don't know their names but they handled my overcooked steak so quickly and with so much professionalism. I've never been treated so well before at a restaurant. Kudos to them."}
{"text":"This place is a great place to take anyone to make a great impression, with 5 star ambiance and quality food, but your paying for all of it for table cloth fine dining. The Calamari appetizer is one of the best dishes on the menu. The steaks are quality an the service is as well. The lemon drop martini is the best to be had anywhere from east coast to west coast! My only peeve on my dining experience tonight is the speed of which the main course was delivered to the table as we finished our apps with no time to breath. But truly a solid 4 1/2 star restaurant! Come with your girlfriend as I did and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Simply Wow! The food was high class tasty, the service top notch and the portions perfect. We had a wonderful salad that we split, a steak, and spinach and Brussels sprouts side dishes.  It was a wonderful dinner date out. My only negative was having to use my cell phone flashlight to read the menu; too dark in there."}
{"text":"Every Monday at Eddie V's customers seated in the bar area get half off certain items on the bar menu.  My favorties from the half off menu are the iceberg salad and the Kung Pai Calamari.  They also have an extensive list of seasonal oysters and excellent wines.  After 10pm it turns into an over 50 singles scene."}
{"text":"Whomever Justin S.  That responded to my review does not exist according to your three hosts on Saturday evening.  Three of us visiting from out of town again gave you another try and just for some drinks.  Your computer systems were down and you refused to seat us.  Not sure who this restaurant thinks they are but remember you are a chain."}
{"text":"This place currently is \" a place where you want to be seen\". If that's important to you, then quit reading this and go. Otherwise, this place was a mixed bag. First - the service: I felt like I had walked into a room where an argument had just taken place. There was no interaction, helpfulness, or friendliness between the staff. A  younger lady and a middle aged man constantly walked around (manger and maitre d'?) with stern looks, never a smile to the customers or  - forbid!- a stop by the table to see if everyone's enjoying themselves. Our waiter was friendly enough - to us - but didn't know the dishes as well as he claimed. He answered preparation questions incorrectly, we came to discover when our food arrived. Water glasses would be filled - for 1/2 the table. Dishes and drinks were slow to arrive. The main dishes were very slow to arrive - we were happy enough talking among ourselves and didn't ask about them, but our waiter stopped by 3(!) times to say the dishes would be out soon.  There was an excellent jazz trio playing in the bar area, one of the highlights of the experience. Yes, it was loud in the entire restaurant, but not as bad as others in this city - who don't have live music.   The food: I was served the caprese salad - 3 small to medium tomato slices, a tablespoon of cheese, on an very large plate for $15. Everyone looked at it when it was served and asked,\"where's the rest of the salad?\" All of the salads were small - the smallest wedge salad I've seen, and the Caesar wasn't much better. Taste was very good, though. We all had fish - 3 swordfish - small but excellent,and grouper, small also. The grouper is served on a corn fondue - if you don't know what that means don't feel bad. Our waiter didn't either, even though he gave a (completely wrong) answer when asked while ordering. It means basically a hollandaise sauce, with maybe some creamed corn in it? Fortunately it was under the fish, so the filet could be removed from the dish and enjoyed without it. The grouper itself was very good. We ordered a couple of side dishes, these were of a pretty good size - but one was the Brussels sprouts, and they were burnt. We eat and make Brussels sprouts frequently, I understand what the chefs were going for, but the fine line was crossed and they were burnt.  A couple of us ordered desserts, creme brulee and an apple cobbler. It took so long to arrive, we were sorry we had ordered them, but they were very good.  So, in summation : this is a chain (with 16 locations and growing). Pretentious atmosphere. Strange, slow service. Pretty good food, poor value. I really don't want to go back, and that's the final measure. In Pittsburgh, for the same cost or far less, there are so many better choices for dining."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Eddie V's since their relocation from DC Ranch to the Scottsdale Quarter, but I sure wasn't disappointed. I could not try ordering anything else besides the Parmesan-Encrusted Sole and it has not changed it's culinary explosion of flavor one bit. The experience was romantic, the atmosphere was wonderful with a live musician, and we absolutely adored our waiter, Michael. I definitely wish we had more of an appetite leftover from our entrees for the dessert options, but after two side dishes, an appetizer, in addition to the entrees we were filled to the brim.   We will definitely return."}
{"text":"The crab cakes are the best I've had. They are 7 oz mixed with two different craps. It was amazing. I ordered filet mignon med and it was dry and over cooked. Very very disappointed. I wouldn't return for steaks. Overpriced and under served."}
{"text":"I ordered wine and an appetizer. The crab cake came out lukewarm and when on my last bite the wine arrived.  I was very disappointed."}
{"text":"Fantastic happy hour spot with drink specials!  Love grabbing my girls for a drink after work. Location and service are great!"}
{"text":"Sat in the bar area to listen to the impeccable Jazz trio led by visiting California-based musician, AJ Degrasse. His voice was the highlight of the visit! While there, enjoyed the Heirloom tomato salad, with Italian burrata cheese (perfect for the steamy day outside) and 1/2 a dozen of their fresh, briny east coast oysters: a variety of 4 to choose from (& they also offer west coast oysters).  Finished the night with their smooth primo margarita served up. Opulent ambiance with entertainment & bites to match. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We had a perfect dinner there on the 4th of July. Our server was very friendly and attentive to our table. The food was amazing as usual. This time we tried one of their specials, soft shell crab salad, which was fantastic. We would highly recommend both the cobbler and the bananas foster since both desserts were great!"}
{"text":"Went to Eddie V's to have a quick dinner before my husband and I went to go see a movie (no kids for the night). We ordered 2 salads, 2 steaks, one water and one ice-tea. The server was sorta pissed that we were NOT there to eat more or rack up the bill. He kept asking, \"is that all you want to order?\"   After we got our food, that was it, no more server!! He kept on going to the table of single girls and a table who had an obvious high roller sitting at it.   We were regulars there until this....We've been there and ordered a hundred bucks or more on just 2 people, had great service but if you there for a quick bite, forget it!!!  ***************  Went there to celebrate our parents anniversary, sat on the patio, it was great. Service was great too. We were able to take advantage of the happy hour prices as well.  Sister ordered the soup. An assistant to our server came around her to  plate some soup for my bro-n-law and at that moment my sister started to say, \"OUCH\" \"OUCH\" \"OUCH\"....the kid was accidently pouring hot soup all over her arm. I felt so bad for her. Our server was mortified. The manager came out and said he will pay for the dry cleaning on my sister \"Target\" cotton t-shirt, pretty funny. Later my sister told the manager that she appreciated the coupon but she doesn't dry clean clothes and she doesn't so he gave her a free meal for her next visit.   The lobster fried rice is a must and so is there truffled mac and cheese.  If you go, eat at the bar or patio and go for the happy hour. Just beware of hot soup on your arm! :)"}
{"text":"Have to say this is by far one of my favorite restaurants and often go for family celebrations! The staff is always accommodating and friendly. The bar area is a great ambiance and provides live jazz music. The dining area is cozy and more intimate atmsphere.   Each time I go, I can't stay away from their North Atlantic Lemon Sole. It's a huge portion (even I can't finish it all) and it is decently priced.  It is the perfect combination of herbs, lemon, garlic, all with a parmesean crust and flaky fish.  If you go you definitely can't leave without trying their raved about Banana's Fosters! Not only is the taste incredible, but also the presentation speaks for itself. It is a moist butter cake topped with caramelized bananas that is then set on fire with a rum and brown sugar mixture. You think that's it, but then you taste the toffee ice cream... Safe to say it's heaven."}
{"text":"We went here for our wedding anniversary after it being highly recommended... upon sitting down we had rose petals and a special card and the ambiance was warm and inviting-- unfortunately, this was the high point of the evening (and between that and the food-- the only reason why this exp. got 2 stars)... while the food was incredible, the service was not. We had 4 courses in just over an hour... which is fast paced to say the least (we were left with horrible stomach aches at the pace dinner was served). We spent time researching the best place to spend our wedding anniversary because every special occasion is important. Our experience was not what we were hoping for. Our server (lizette) was curt and cold and rushed us through dinner (it seemed as if we were inconveniencing her with our presence). It was relatively slow when we went through, yet -- we were seated right by the kitchen  and could hear their jostling and banter from our table and our experience felt like we were being pushed out of there ... what was meant to be a special celebration turned into a supreme disappointment. To note:: the 70 minutes we spent dining-- not a single manager visited and asked about our food and experience... on a slow evening, the entire experience was a large disappointment. We will not be returning.  My advice:: if you are going for food, while good, the experience tarnishes it in a way that it can't recover. I'd spend your money elsewhere on a place that places value in their customers (since this place clearly did not)."}
{"text":"Sooo... if you know me, you know I am the first to account for my mistakes. I posted Friday regarding the unpleasant experience I had trying to get into the new Eddie V's seafood restaurant uptown Charlotte. Well, after speaking with Rachel, the Orlando Sales Mgr, we rescheduled my Mother's Day reservation.  OMGosh!  It started with a fresh rose at the door and being welcomed by a friendly and beautiful staff. I chose to dine in the lounge. As you can see here everything on the menu sounded great. I opted for the deviled eggs,  crab omelette and held to think about dessert.  They brought out this huge cinnamon roll as bread for the table, gaahhh!  Next comes the cutest little deviled eggs I've ever seen, each topped with a different treat (crab, salmon). Next comes my entree. There was crab jumping out of this omelet and the portion was uncontrollable.  I had to box that and the cinnamon roll. Finally I decided on the Bananas Foster for dessert. You can see here that it was fun, but the flavor was outstandirageouscredible!!!  All this while chatting with the friendliest bar tender and listening to cozy music played on the bar piano.  Eddie V's (Ev's for short) you are my new seafood stop. I can hardly wait to try their happy hour!  THIS PLACE IS A MUST TRY.  10 stars tripping on the 5-star scale"}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday and wow this place was amazing. I loved the live music and atmosphere here. Our waiter Adam was great and made the experience. He helped walk us through the menu. We had the Hawaiian sashimi and the ahi tuna tartare to start. Both were rich in flavor and would definitely recommend. He also brought us oysters cause he heard my fiancé saying she liked them and I had never really had them. The oysters (which I thought I'd hate) turned out being something I wanna come back here for and have more of. Then for dinner my fiancé had the ahi tuna which literally melted in your mouth and I had the NY strip with the peppercorn sauce.  Definitely one of the best steaks I've had in pittsburgh. Finally we finished it off with some port and a creme brûlée. Definitely will be coming back and telling others."}
{"text":"Simply super!   Brian provided impeccable service. We had calamari as a starter very remarkable.  Crab cakes., Best in Arizona.  The sole delightful.  Be back real soon"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. I cannot say enough what a pleasure it was to dine here. Amazing drinks, appetizers and dessert. Of course, the seafood entrees are phenomenal. Highly recommend for a peaceful enjoyable dining experience."}
{"text":"For me Eddie V's never disappoints.  Fantastic service, incredible food, great choices, terrific atmosphere... this is now my go-to place for an overall grand experience.  They offer Valet parking which I love... nothing worse than getting all dressed up and having to walk 2 blocks to get to your destination.  It is $3 plus tip... just an FYI.  We always make reservations just to be sure we'll get in.  If the tables not ready they have a very nice bar area to enjoy a cocktail while you wait.  Both times recently our table was ready even though we arrived a bit early so we just sat down.  Service is A+, first class all the way.  You can just relax and enjoy your dinner.  Things I love, Sea Bass!  OMG it is wonderful!  If you like Sea Bass... get it.  It is a huge portion and its usually market price...  Last time I ordered it was $35 which I thought very reasonable considering the portion size.  Very easily shared by two with smaller appetites. Sorry... back to appetizers... Oyster lovers love the oysters here!  they are on the happy hour menu in the bar area.  Yellowtail sashimi is OMG to die for.  Heirloom tomato salad was fantastic too.  Filet always a good choice... The asparagus was cooked to perfection and I would choose the augratin potatoes over the twice baked.  Ive had both and I prefer mashed or baked usually but these augratin are wow... really great.  The Sole is super!  It is a HUGE portion so unless you are a big eater or you are sharing... there is too much to eat but its prepared to a T!  It has a crispy exterior due to the parmasan crusting... and its delish!  Oh and if you order a steak... you can order any way, any sauce, peppered, etc.... pretty much it seems if you ask they most likely can do.  Just the way you like it! They also have live jazz playing in the bar area... very nice touch."}
{"text":"My awesome wife surprised me for my birthday with a dinner at Eddie V's. I consider myself a bit of a foodie, and being raised near Boston I am very particular about seafood.  At the suggestion of our server (wish I wrote down her name..sorry!) I ordered the Chilean Seabass special. It was simply broiled with some lemon and olive oil on a bed of Asparagus. It was simply the BEST piece of fish I have ever had! My wife enjoyed the scallops that were cooked to perfection and we shared fried oysters and some yellowtail sashimi.  For dessert we devoured a bananas foster served impressively flambé tableside! The table selection was perfect and just what my wife asked for. We were seated promptly at reservation time and at no time felt rushed or ignored. Yes, it's pricey, but welcome to Scottsdale and you do get what you pay for. BRAVO EDDIE V'S!"}
{"text":"Excellent seafood and steakhouse!  If you're going to splurge on a terrific meal, this place checks the box as it has a wide array of options on the menu, classic table service, and an upscale yet not so \"stuffy\" atmosphere.    Starting with some incredible appetizers and finishing with dynamite desserts, this place delivers on all fronts!  Just don't get shocked at the end (when your bill comes), as you should know what you signed up for - a great place to dine!"}
{"text":"BEST RESTAURANT EVER!!! - I have written other reviews for this lovely establishment, and sometimes, after a series of amazing meals and cocktails here, I feel like I need to write something new.  If you live in AZ, or visit AZ, if you do not try this wonderful restaurant, you are missing out on the finest dining experience I have ever had.  To some, that may not seem like a bold statement, however, I travel and dine at a lot of restaurants.  I have experienced some of the finest restaurants and cuisine in the world, and Eddie V's has raised the bar so high, there are only a handful of places that you can compare them to.    Typically I dine in the V Lounge, and on weekends, this bar is so busy, people are standing three deep drinking and enjoying the music and atmosphere.  The service at the bar has recently exceeded even my expectations.  I am sure finding good bartenders is a tedious task, but currently they have \"nailed it\".  Eddie V's has always had a couple of strong bartenders, but they currently have three really strong, amazing bartenders, and one fantastic bar back.  Together they do not miss a beat.  No matter how busy they get, they are all fun, personable and provide excellent service.    Eddie V's latest addition to the bar staff, was a shock to me, but has proven himself to be a stellar performer.  When I first met him, I was skeptical, as I am typically accustomed to Steve making my perfect cocktail.  The day I met this new bartender, whose name is Mike, I had a really rough day, and did not feel like training someone to craft my beverage.  Much to my apprehension, Mike crafted a perfect beverage.  I later learned, he was actually a paramedic by profession, and during the particular visit, I had a headache.  Mike asked if he could show me something to relieve it, again skeptical, but intrigued.  Mike came around, held a few pressure points in my poor aching head, and about 2 minutes later, headache was gone.  In addition to perfect cocktails and perfect food, I was given the opportunity to meet someone that I hope will remain with Eddie V's for years to come.  I believe he truly is an asset to this team.   I have entertained multiple vendors, friends and employees in the V Bar, and Mike makes everyone of them feel like a \"regular\" customer.  Mike is always happy, always smiling, always fun and never seems to get stressed or bothered by anything around him, and I always leave feeling like I am the most important person in the world.  Mike just has an innate ability to transfer his amazing, positive energy to the entire room.   If you have never had the pleasure of having a bartender that you immediately feel like they are your friend, then please stop and meet Mike. He would love to welcome you!"}
{"text":"Eddie V's was phenomenal from beginning to end. I was first impressed with the high tech (cell phone based system) valet parking. Once you step in the ambiance was exquisite and picture perfect. Although, you'll need some additional lighting for selfies b/c it's a bit dark. My group of servers (team model) were very attentive and thoughtful. They offered great pairing recommendations. I had the crab cake appetizer and the Ribeye with the crab stuffed shrimp accompaniment. My friend had the lobster tacos and sea bass (which I sampled). The sides come a la carte so one of our servers recommended doing 2 smaller portioned sides. So we opted for the crab fried rice and au gratin cheddar potatoes. Everything (minus the shrimp) was superb! I'm a lover of crab stuffed shrimp and theirs was okay. Theirs came with plenty of crab, still I've had better. I paired my meal with a nice Malbec. I highly recommend Eddie V's and will definitely go back. Their happy hour menu is next on my list."}
{"text":"What a way to spend a Wednesday evening after work!! Our first choice changed, so we tried Eddie Vs and I am so glad we did. The bartender, Patrick, was amazing. Not only did he make an amazing drink but delivered impeccable service. Each EV teammate was amazing!! The icing on the cake was the live band.....just so mellow, classic and absolutely drove the ambience in the bar space.   I WILL be back...again and again!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely exceptional service and food! I had a 1 lb lobster tail with a twice baked potato and an order of beets. Amazing!  The servers were delightful... and the piano entertainment was fantastic... overall from the time we arrived to when we walked out the door we were simply happy. I would high recommend Eddie Vs.... we came to celebrate a special occasion and not only did they prepare in advance with rose petals... a card and contratulatiins...they also included a free desert! Thank you EDDIE V ...we will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"At it's new location, Eddie V's picked up where it left off in DC Ranch in terms of food.  Ahi Tartare is always the choice for an appetizer, followed by some good old fashioned red meat.    The Fish Fans in our crew commented how fresh the sea bass was and how the mild seasoning enhanced the flavor - no shocker there.  The one ding that needs to put out there was service.   The restaurant was quite busy, particularly for a weeknight, but  details were just missed.  It goes without saying that an order of oysters should have an oyster fork with it (Too slimy to be a finger food).  And though I have heard it a million times before, I kind of missed the waiter's warning me to \"be careful with the Atomic Horseradish; it's very hot.\"  Funny, how they never forgot this at the old place.  Finally, our waiter might well have been descended from used car salesmen as he tried to upsell us on almost everything possible.  It detracted from the ambience of a sophisticated evnvironment and a very good meal.  No worries, we'll give Eddie V's another chance to earn that fifth star."}
{"text":"This new, upscale restaunt has beautiful decor and the food is high quality and delicious.  However,  they still have a few things to work out as it relates to service.  As an offshoot of The Capital Grill, I expected more than the Valet to tell me that if I wasn't done by midnight, I would have to walk to the B of A garage and pay an extra $22 for parking.  The wait staff wears very nice, butler style jackets, but they seemed inexperienced and not well trained.  The bar service was sub par as well.  Our bartender was not familiar with the menu and seemed timid and reluctant to engage as good bartenders do.  I hope this helps and I hope they get it together because I would like to add Eddie V's to my list of places to go."}
{"text":"What a wonderful restaurant. Very pricey but well worth it. We had a party of 8 and everyone was more than happy with their meals. The service was second to none. Great atmosphere with some lovely music. We had our own room and with the door closed we could talk yet still hear the music. Highly recommend giving it a try.  If I'm ever back here I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Eddie V's. Everything was very good I got the Fuji Apple salad and was huge and delicious. We got the crab cake for a appetizer it was huge and very good. I got the Sea bass and it was cooked perfectly and my husband got the 12oz filet and it was cooked perfectly. We got the crab fried rice it was amazing very good! Thomas our waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu and very good! The service was excellent!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants at the Scottsdale Quarter, as well as in La Jolla. You can never go wrong with the Lemon Sole as it's prepared incredibly well (very tender with a fine breading layer that doesn't take away from the texture) and paired with a garlic butter sauce, the crab cakes are the best I've had anywhere as is the calamari! Truffle Mac and cheese or baby beets with candied walnuts pairs very well with a 8oz filet. Definitely a romantic enough location for intimate conversation or a general fine dining experience."}
{"text":"Outstanding in every way. Well-designed, comfortable, a little too dark, maybe, but food and service are excellent. Fine menu. Valet parking. This place will be a regular stop for me."}
{"text":"I have been there a number of times, and have absolutely loved any appetizers, desserts, soups, and salads I have ordered.  I wish I could give 5 stars, but the few times that I have ordered a main dish have all been disappointing.  I just haven't liked any of the fish that I have eaten, and I think it has to do with cooking style.  I really like my fish \"well-done\" and not \"fishy\" tasting, but have had trouble with any fish entree I have ordered there.  I will continue to go to Eddie V's for great desserts and great appetizers, even the samples of sushi we were offered were awesome!  And we especially love going there when Al Ortiz is playing music.  Just not for a full dinner."}
{"text":"Excellent ambiance, excellent service, excellent presentation, fine music.  The scallops and crabcake were simply subpar."}
{"text":"Been to Eddie V's enough times to know what to order!!! Sunday is always the best time for our family, the happy hour runs through out the night in the lounge. Ordered the oysters both raw and breaded, yummers. Potstickers, 3 orders of filet sliders, 2 orders of lamb lollipops, crab fried rice, truffle mac and cheese, scalloped potatoes, fuji apple salad, and the crab corn chowder which was for me and it was outstanding!!! The service, as always is spot on. Oh who can leave Eddie V's without ordering the best dessert, the bananas foster cake . Always my favorite fine dining establishment in N Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"I am in Charlotte working for the next month and I wanted a Negroni cocktail. Where I live we celebrate NEGRONI WEEK and the best part about that week is every bar participates, they get creative and some of the proceeds go to help local animal shelters. So you get to have amazing craft cocktail while helping puppies and kittens. So I was excited to have one here.   We stepped into Eddie Vs and I loved the vibe immediately. It was a bustling after work happy hour scene along with people who came to dine. The bar was nice and no one waited for a cocktail or a refill as all the bartenders helped each other.   Welp!!! There was no Negroni to be had but our Bar God Patrick suggested the Jasmine as he was out of sweet red Vermouth. The Jasmine ended up tasting like the Negroni's cute little sister. It was super yummy.   Let's chat about those noms noms they were offering. The tuna tartar was so fresh and the sliced grapefruit added the perfect acid to the tartar. The shasimi was delicious and the sauce that they had it in was so good I could've licked the plate. The Calamari was really good as well.   I can't wait to go back....."}
{"text":"If you have the opportunity to visit Eddie V's, don't miss it!  It's an outstanding experience.  My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our dinner and music later in the lounge.  My husband had the wedge salad and salmon - the salmon being the 'best he's ever had\".  I had the Caesar salad and Chilean Sea Bass, Hong Kong Style, which I highly recommend.  For dessert, we split Eddie V's version of blackberry cobbler, which was amazing.  The entire staff is attentive - Michael was our server, he's wonderful.  The music in the lounge that night was incredible.  I will definitely return to Eddie V's on my next visit to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I can attest to the drinks, service and an appetizer/desert evening. All were great! I feel like I spent too much money, but that's part of partying in Scottsdale, I suppose. I had some delicious wine, while my friends also enjoyed what they ordered. There was live music and a lively crowd at the bar. Definitely not a quiet spot for a small talk date, but definitely fun for a girls' night out. Hope to see you there!"}
{"text":"Nice dining rooms.  Light dinner for two came out to $180.  Very good: Pomegranate Mule.  Good:  Riesling wine; Shrimp oreganata with crab meat.  okay: fried rice with crab meat.  I don't remember the soup and salad that was ordered."}
{"text":"First time at this Eddie V's.  Service was very good, food was excellent.  I had the gulf stuffed shrimp and they were done to perfection, and incredibly filling.  The crab fried rice was delicious.  Even though it seemed a bit out of place on this menu, I had the pot stickers for an appetizer, and they were done perfectly.  My wife had the crab cake appetizer and it was also delicious.  She ordered the scallops, and this is the only issue we had, when they arrived at the table, 2 of the scallops were obviously undercooked.  But the way the wait staff and management handled the issue was remarkable, offering either to re-do the meal, or bring an entire new dish.  I think the way an establishment handles an issue is just as important as the food and atmosphere.  The atmosphere was very warm and cozy, and the piano bar where we retired to after dinner was wonderful.  The entire staff was attentive without being intrusive (which is a difficult balance to maintain), friendly and welcoming.  The live jazz trio was wonderful."}
{"text":"Never disappoints. I fell upon this restaurant in Houston Texas and was very happy to find one back here in Scottsdale Arizona. This place has it all. Very upscale design and ambiance to match. You feel comfortable casual or dressy. The service has never missed and one reason this is our current favorite restaurant. If you love steak or seafood you will never know their specialty as both are equally excellent. I fall into complete bliss as I slowly devoir my Lobster Bisque. Bread, yes please! As good a baguette as you can find without going to France. Now the wife's appetite is always the Filet Mignon with the béarnaise. Melts on your fork before it reaches your mouth. I love the divers sea scallops in the brown buerre sauce. No really I love them. Would divorce my wife if it was possible to marry them. Always fresh and delicious. I cook scallops to but can never come close to their perfection and consistency. Dessert. Only if I insist. Everything they serve is a further compliment to their flare in selection and presentation. Well Yelp! It's almost Friday and TGI Eddie V's."}
{"text":"First time here. Wonderful ambience. Upscale attire. Superb food. We tried the Kung Pao calamari which was delicious, a side sauce would have been nice. Everything we had was delicious: scallops, mashed potatoes, Brussel sprouts, filet mignon. My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our date night without the kids. We'll be back."}
{"text":"We are visiting from out of state and I saw the great Yelp reviews and decided to try it out! We were celebrating our 4th anniversary and were met with a table of rose petals and a Happy anniversary card from the staff. The service was top notch and the food was even better!   We ordered the crab cakes, lobster bisque, fillets and Brussel sprouts and we were very pleased with everything! Steak was cooked to perfection!!   Loved the atmosphere with live jazz music & great wine selection!   At the very end of our meal we were surprised with a complementary dessert for our anniversary! Everyone there went out of their way to make our dinner date exceptional!   We will definitely be returning when we come back to town! 5 stars for sure!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service, great wine list and a great Happy Hour. The $1 Louisiana Oysters on the half shell are a hard appetizer to turn down. The fish can come simply grilled and their Grouper is the freshest I have enjoyed in the West!  The ambiance is really nice and there's valet parking or free self park downstairs. After all we ate and drank, I was glad to have self-parked as I \"sort of exercised\" walking back to the car.   Eddie V's has a really pretty interior and was well though-out. I love the glass wine display and the wine list is equally as impressive.   This is a must try, special occasion place with live music. folks are generally dressed up, but I was admitted in jeans. Great spot and I look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"One word: Crab Cake.  I know this is a corporate type cookie cutter restaurant, but it is hard to deny the pimp that is Eddie V's.  First of all, they have live music and hire good musicians. I know, cause I've played here. A particularly great night to come is Sunday, as \"The New Wrecking Crew\" throws down some out jazzy noises, but everyone playing there is legit.  Second, everything I've eaten there is top notch.  Maine Lobster Tacos... oh yeah. Truffle mac and chac is banging. Steak carpaccio is killing it. I haven't even touched on an entree' yet.  They have a sushi bar too.  The one thing that pushed this joint over the edge for me is the crab cake. This is the most glorious crab cake you will get in AZ.  Crabby as hell with just enough other stuff to hold it together.  The crab is fresh and high grade.  Man it tastes so good, I'm about ready to go get one now.  Did I mention they have Duvel?  That's right if you're going to have a limited selection of beer, go for the gusto.  The service here is great and the management is incredibly nice... I don't think I've worked as a musician at a restaurant that has nicer management.  This place is expensive, but it's definitely well worth it."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday dinner with my boyfriend.  We have been to the one in Austin and loved it.    We had a bit of everything.  Started with the Tuna Tartare and the oysters.  The tartare was ok, but not that great.  I usually love Tuna Tartare The oysters were delicious!   We each had a cocktail, I went with the red martini and he had a Bullet Manhattan. His drink was better than mine.    Filet mignon for me and bone-in rib eye for him.  We each got one single stuffed shrimp on the side. I didn't know you could order a single one, so that was fun.  I also ordered the truffle mac n cheese, which was delicious!  Needless to say our eyes were bigger than our stomachs, but we were happy to bring home the leftovers!   It's not your birthday without dessert so we went with the Bananas Foster. Effing yum."}
{"text":"We celebrated my birthday last night. Our table was set with birthday confetti and a birthday card from the staff. Our waiter, Jeramy, was new and we were actually his second table and you would have never known. He was awesome, the service was excellent. Our food was tremendous, and the atmosphere is wonderful. My apple pie dessert came put with a candle and was on the house. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Eddie V's where have you been when we've been hankering for delicious and creative crab dishes?  This was our last dinner on our Scottsdale journey, and unfortunately we had been eating like we were going to the electric chair.  So we decided to go light even though we were surrounded by delicious seafood and steak preparations.   However, everything we had was superb.  Our friend raved about the lobster bisque.  My wife ordered a seafood salad that had a giant poached prawn along with a generous portion of lump crab.  Two highlights:  a true jumbo lump crab cake with very little filler, perfectly seared with a delicious sauce.  The wives couldn't even finish it while sharing with the guys.  Then came the crab fried rice, which was full of lump crab, tasty and spicey, better than any Chinese restaurant we've been to.  It was superb, and we thanked our excellent server Drew for the recommendation.  Our only regret is that we didn't have bigger appetites, and only scratched the surface of an incredible restaurant.  The good news for us, is we found Eddie V's are also in San Diego, La Jolla and Chicago!  We are already salivating at a visit in the hopefully not too distant future."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner and what could have turned out to be an average dinner turned out to be a great one. It was a rocky start at the beginning but with a few adjustments became a happy ending.  Didn't feel the vibe with the waitress we started with.  The Mai Tai she recommended (which I couldn't put down) was definitely not the \"best drink\" of the house.  We asked for another server and glad we did.  Everything Kara recommended was delicious. From the oysters to the shrimp appetizers...everything was right on par.  We ended up ordering the sea bass and filet mignon...Excellent.  Oh and the Artemis from Stag's Leap was a perfect pairing  with the filet she suggested.  Experience is everything  and I can say it was phenomenon.  Thanks again for a wonderful night...will be back real soon.  Did I mention the chocolate lava cake...heaven."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Food was fantastic. The crab cake is a MUST. The special of raw scallops were so good! Service was perfect.  The band playing Saturday night was really good !  We live closer to Wild Fish so we probably won't drive up to Scottsdale Quarter but I would recommend trying either when you can."}
{"text":"Our family was visiting town and wanted to enjoy a nice steak or seafood dinner. We were a little concerned by the business casual attire but found many people in jeans and a polo shirt. Great ambiance with live music and a attractive wine area. Seating was very comfortable. The AC was on a little high for Memorial Day weekend but we were able to adjust after awhile.   Our wait staff was great. Shared his favorites and gave us time to order when asked, kept the table clean and arranged for payment in a different area (we always fight for the bill at any restaurant).   All the steaks ( NY strip, filet mignon and bone in sirloin) were perfectly cooked. The sea bass was outstanding. The appetizers of the calamari and blue point oysters were enjoyable as well. The Godiva chocolate and bananas foster was a perfect end to the evening.   Very family oriented and private (they kept some predator hockey players in a special area). We would definitely recommend this place and go again."}
{"text":"I used to love this place. Had a business dinner about 2 months that was a poor experience. Specifically a filet that was supposed to be medium rare that was cooked to beef jerky. Okay...it happens, it was a big table. Because if the nature of the dinner it would not have been good to send it back. I ate it. Last week was back for another work related dinner. Again ordered a filet medium, again served well done. This time let the server know, by the time the new steak was ready everyone was done so thankfully they put it in a to go box.   This is a nice place with expensive food. If they can't cook steak to the right temp I'm not going back.   Three stars because the service is always great and the Mac and cheese is some of the best around...."}
{"text":"Love this place. The have all day happy hour on Sunday's and Monday's. Great bar staff and live music too. I was in town for a week and went here twice. It's pricey but well worth it. The lobster tacos for happy hour are a steal!"}
{"text":"Great service! Great food & drinks! Beautiful atmosphere as well! My only complaint wasn't with the restaurant it is with the foul mouthed man we were seated next to. I'm all for a fun experience, but when you start asking the server about her sexual preferences it's a bit too far. Kudos to that server for being so professional. Overall it's a great upscale restaurant! Some people don't know how to act around attractive women in the service industry."}
{"text":"Came here to catch up with a friend I haven't seen in a while. First of all, I LOVE that they have a Saturday happy hour. We sat at the bar and enjoyed a few cocktails and some great food.   First, the cocktails were delicious and perfectly crafted.   The food....omg. We started with some oysters. We tried the batter fried, the carpetbagger, and the rockafeller. Each were absolutely delicious. Next was the steak and lobster tartare, followed by the swordfish entree with Brussels sprouts.   All I can say is perfection.  I also like that they had some music playing, although it seemed extremely loud for the space and they didn't seem to play for very long. I thought they were just taking a break, but they never came back.  I guess my only complaint would be the ladies room. It's super small and cramped and extremely difficult to maneuver if there's ANYONE waiting. I find it hard to believe that a restaurant of that size and stature made such a poor ladies room.   I truly can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This place is a definite hit or miss. And unfortunately, our visit on Sunday was a disastrous one. The appetizers were over- cooked, in honesty, it looked and tasted recycled.  Perhaps someone ordered it and returned it and the kitchen decided to \"recycle\" it.   The entree of Parmesan crusted Dover sole was large in portion but quantity over quality didn't seem appropriate when it was not edible. Issues with one entree can happen....but two appetizers and entrees...Inexcusable!!!   We complained. The server seemed genuinely concerned. She advised us the manager was alerted so that he can properly address the poor display of \"food.\" We waited for over 15 minutes to no avail. We decided to pay the bill, even though we didn't eat the food, as we needed to leave.   This overall experience has sealed its  definitive end to our patronage at this restaurant."}
{"text":"My husband and I just went here for Thanksgiving dinner.  The food was great, but I do have a few problems people might want to take note of.  First off, we waited in the bar until our table was ready, maybe 20 minutes, and the live music (one piano, one guitar) was so loud that by the time we went to our table, my throat was really getting sore.  The turkey dinner was great and went off without a hitch.  At the end, our waiter asked if we wanted to see a dessert menu.  I told him that on the email originally sent out by EV's, dessert was supposed to be included.  So he ended up giving us a hot, chocolate cake to share.  Which was fine, but not what was listed (I don't remember off hand).  He did not offer us any more drinks and I had to track him down earlier in the meal to get another glass of wine.  He also didn't offer coffee with the dessert.  I got the impression he was upset because he had to give us dessert which he probably had to comp because when I looked at EV's website, dessert was no longer included in the Thanksgiving Day menu offering.  Also, I didn't care for the weird little overflow room they stuck us in.  It's off in the left corner so if they ever start leading you that why to seat you, stop them if you can. I just assumed (you know what they say about assuming) that if you make your reservations a month and a half in advance, they will give you a little priority.  Probably won't come back here.  Too many other nice steakhouses to try in the Scottsdale/Phoenix area.  Just wasn't that impressed."}
{"text":"The last time I was in this space I bought a pair of black dress shoes. It was then Larimor's, 15 years ago. I still have the shoes. The restaurant here now, Eddie V's, is beautifully designed, leaving no hint it was once a men's store. The live jazz music completes the attractive dining environment. The menu features seafood, but there are also plenty of meat options, along with the expected apps, salads, sides, and deserts. Tonight we shared the tomato mozzarella salad, both selected the parmigiana sole entre, and shared the bananas foster desert. Everything was excellent. The only thing to criticize, amazingly, was the portion of sole, which was too large. Really! Service was excellent, although the restaurant was not full, so the server was not challenged. The wine list is well constructed with good selections and reasonable prices. Overall it was a very good experience, but the prices make it a special occasion restaurant. We will return for our next special occasion."}
{"text":"Great Thursday night Happy Hour, with shared calamari, heirloom tomato salad and lollipop lamb chops...and Moscow mules. Fantastic jazz. Good vibe. Great service. Fun."}
{"text":"The lounge had a great atmosphere and Guy Pennacchio was incredible!  However, the service was poor!"}
{"text":"We went here last night for dinner. Everything was just perfect, from the second we walked in. We where seated straight away( we had reservation). Our waiter, I think his name was Darko,  was coming to check up on us every few minutes. And the food!! Incredible!! Every single dish was truly made to perfection. Even the salad tasted fantastic! Next time we are in Arizona,we are coming back for sure!!"}
{"text":"If I lived in Scottsdale AZ., I would be a regular!  Just the appetizers alone were fantastic.  We were invited by my wife's grand parents.  We had reservations, sat at the bar and later enjoyed some great Jazz (great vocals).  The Maryland-Style All Lump Crab Cake with Chive Remoulade Sauce and the (lightly battered) Scallops appetizer were both unbelievable and a must order!!!  The Chive Remoulade Sauce (for the crab cakes)  were an excellent complement and not too heavy!  The crab cakes rivaled a restaurant in Norfolk VA., known for crab cakes.  Each crab cake can serve 2 if not 3 or you order several other appetizers. For an entrée, I highly recommend the Chilean Sea Bass - Roasted Crisp which very flavorful, flaky and moist!  My wife had the Lemon Sole in Parmesan Crust, but the sea bass was much better.  I did enjoy the lemon sauce though.    We also enjoyed the Potato and Gruyère Fritters (awesome, if you can afford the calories and fat cals), Sugar Snap Peas with Garlic & Sesame, Sautéed Spinach with Garlic (excellent) and some mushroom dish.  I wish I tried Truffled Macaroni and Cheese!    Also, I wish we left room for dessert, since the table next to us had a wonderful chocolate dessert, probably the Hot Chocolate Godiva Cake, next time!"}
{"text":"I haven't graced their doorstep in over five years but that all changes now.  The Norwegian Salmon tasted like Copper River salmon on roids. The filet literally melted in my mouth it was so tender.  A few years ago, I wanted to hurt the kitchen staff with some sort of Tower of London what-the-fuck torture device.  Now I'm singing their praises from the rafters. Go figure.  I feel like Dr Jekyl after Eddie V's - the two experiences making me confront my duality issues. Thanks for that."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, dark and intimate with a great jazz band playing. Seated at the bar by myself taking it all in, relaxing with my vodka cranberry with a lime...here on business wishing I had gotten here earlier as this outside shopping center is the BOMB!!! Eddie V's offers valet parking for $5.00, it's worth just pay when you finish with your fine dining experience.  The bartenders are attentive as you would expect in a fine dining restaurant. I ordered the crab cake and it was awesome and comes with remoulade sauce. OMG, so much crab and it's a whole meal in its self. Your meal comes with a warm bread loaf.   If I lived here, yes I do believe I would be a regular here. Classy, relaxing a bit noisy but nice place and worth the money."}
{"text":"I had seen this restaurant in La Jolla for years but never made it in. I was excited to see one in Scottsdale Quarter so I could finally try it.  It is really good food but some rooms are better to be seated in and the service can be really slow.  Another plus is it is 1000 points on Open Table."}
{"text":"I had been to this restaurant before and I was a huge fan. However, since the last then they have changed their location. Now, I'm not sure if standards changed along with the venue but there is quite a difference that I felt that I should not have. To begin, I made a reservation only to go in to an additional 30 mintue wait. Why did I even bother calling in advance? Then, once seated I felt rushed by the waiter to get a drink order other than water. He did not seem content with the possiblity of my not ordering a glass of wine. Which of course I did because I happen to love wine. The few that the waiter suggested were of course the higher priced ones. I am assuming he was trying to up his check average that night or something. The one I chose was very bold and so flavorful (and decently priced) that I ended up with a second glass fairly soon after the first. This was pretty much the only part I enjoyed. Throughtout dinner, I felt as though there was just a sea of white hackets walking around with nothing to do. They all seemed to want to be busy but the fact that too many people were working made me feel a bit overwhelmed. There is such a thing as over service.  The appetizer crab cake that I ordered was ill seasoned and under preparred. Not to mention that I actually had some type of shell that I bit down upon and got stuck in my gums. (yuck) Needless to say I was losing my appetite quickly. Then there was of course a long pause before the entrees actually arrived. The dish that I ordered was surprisingly flavorless. The fish was supposed to be moist and light and delicious. It was bland, dry and overcooked. Needless to say I was not expecting anything to be done. However, the manager did come over and appologize and offered me something else. I kindly declined only to be pushed into getting something else. I still kindly declined and said I was no longer hungry. So we sat there for about 10 minutes before the server automatically brought out a dessert I neither asked for nor wanted. He kept trying to tell me I would like it if I only tried it.  I understand that they tried, but there is such a thing as trying too hard and improperly. Then, to end my lovely evening, the dish which I did not eat was still on the check! I decided to stay quiet this time and just pay. So you see, I will not be returning to the place where genuine concern for your guests goes out the window only to be replaced by a car salesmanship attitude followed by the rude audacity to make me pay for food I did not eat! where have all the smart people gone?!"}
{"text":"From the DC area, I was pleased to find an Eddie V's in Pittsburgh.  I got the yellowtail sashimi and the Chilean sea bass which were fresh and delicious.  I personally am not a huge fan of the soy broth sauce on the sea bass as I found it to be a little salty but otherwise it was very good.  Also tried some of my friends' dishes including the shrimp cocktail, lobster tails, and NY strip - all so good!  Great ambiance and service, and live jazz music which is great but a tad on the loud side.  They have valet parking and there are also self-park garages nearby."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here on 5/13. The service, food, music and decor were great! The servers were well dressed paid great attention to detail. It was my birthday and they gave me a rose and a birthday card. I decided to try the swordfish steak, it was prepared perfectly, great flavor! My husband had the salmon oscar style, we chose sautéed spinach which was incredible and bursting with flavor we also chose the lobster mac and cheese GREAT! The music smooth jazz live band live singer, not to cheesy or uptight and most importantly not to loud! The decor was nice with a romantic feel. I would recommend this place for date night, girls night out, private events as they have a private room! The drinks were great I tried the 25 Karate drink, awesomeness! The wine selection was great much to choose from! I would not recommend this place for kids or those who are looking to do anything other than relax."}
{"text":"Really Wonderful restaurant!!! We had such a great meal here for a nice occasion. The Lobster Tacos appetizers were out of this world!!! The restaurant has  a really nice atmosphere, very intimate and beautiful inside. It was a fabulous dinner... I wish I had ordered the Lobster Tacos as a main course!!! I have to say it again, best lobster tacos EVER!!"}
{"text":"Eddie V's let me down this past Wednesday. When we arrived at 6 pm the restaurant was not full during the summer season. I had requested a quiet table. My date- perhaps feeling a bit more lively wanted to sit at a table in in the bar area. I informed the hostess who firmly insisted we take the table I reserved just a couple hours prior. We complied. The waitress was prompt, however I soon became impatient with her because it was clear she was pushing the wine. We purchased a bottle, informed them we would be having a leisurely dinner, my companion is European, and yet she kept rushing the drinks, although ironically she would not pour the San Pelligrino. The oysters were fresh, although the waitress could not tell us where they came from, only the west coast. The Caesar salads were unsatisfactory. My sea bass was properly cooked, but the pickled ginger in the Hong Kong style dish later caused some gastric distress. My date's scallops were fine. The wait staff began to push, forcing my date to finish her dinner much sooner than she would have. We decided to skip the deserts and went elsewhere, where we could take our time. I attempted to contact the restaurant the next day, left messages for the GM, however they never bothered to followup. I feel they should have easily accommodated our request for a different table, they had plenty of tables over the 3 hours we were there and the one we were seeking was not \"reserved\" when I asked for it. The wait staff needs training, in proper handling of plates when picking them up without stacking them chest high as well as working with the customer's pace rather than their own.  At one point I firmly insisted the waitress stop pouring more wine into my already 2/3 full glass. A good Chablis needs to be chilled, especially in Phoenix. The sale seemed more important to her than my ultimate satisfaction. At this point I'm not inclined to return, I would consider the several other options for fine dining at Kierland before going back to Eddie V's."}
{"text":"Not much has changed. I asked for a wine recommendation. The first recommendation was the most expensive white by glass on the menu at $18, the second recommendation was the 2nd most expensive wine by glass on the menu at $16 and the 3rd wine recommendation they gave was a \"discontinued\" wine, not on the menu, but higher priced then all the other wines besides the first 2 they recommended on the menu at $15 a glass. I tried the most expensive, because I have the money- it wasn't worth it though. I've had far superior wines at a number of paces for far less.   What I dislike the most about this place is first, the bartenders will always recommend the most expensive wine on the menu, 2nd I was shocked that the staff (more than one of them) actually asked me what I did for a living without having any other sort of casual conversation... yes, I'm a decent looking lady that looks young for my age and I can afford your ridiculous recommendations... none of your business what I do. How rude. Of course, I tried to explain, but it was over their heads.   Anyhow, a 56 year old man sat beside me and at one point navigated my hand to feel his biceps and pecks... it was actually impressive, but um... yeah- no comment."}
{"text":"Had dinner last night and ordered off the restaurant week menu at $44 per person for a three course meal and it was  delicious!  The service was outstanding and I could not be more satisfied with our experience!  I will definitely be going back again."}
{"text":"Well, I know Yelpers love a steakhouse, but this one gets a \"meh\" from me.  Let me be clear for the people that think I am just cheap and don't know a good meal when I see one...   I am fine with paying top dollar for a meal (and you will certainly do that here), but it better be worth it - and this meal wasn't.     Much of what we had was pretty good - the calamari appetizer, crabcakes, seafood trio, a fish entree, and two sides.   Just pretty good though - maybe slightly above average, but certainly not outstanding.  My steak was really where the problem was - this 8 ounce medium rare filet was a dry and under-seasoned travesty.  The color was right, but there wasn't a drop of juice in this steak.  I don't even know how you accomplish that, but they did. It was flavorless with a dry, chalky texture that was really disappointing.  Apparently, you really need to get the extras to dress it up, because it did not stand well on its own.   Three of us got steaks and we all agreed that they were not great.  We ate most of them, but no one finished their meat.     The service was decent, albeit a bit slow.  The server asked if we were trying to make the hockey game, which we were.  We didn't care about being exactly on time, but we did care about being efficient about it.   He had some personality and seemed to be enjoying his job, which was nice to see.  Definitely a level of formality that suited the place.  There was one minor ordering snafu, which was promptly made right.    The décor is a confused mix of styles meant to be opulent, but really it just missed the mark for me.  Our table (one of the round ones with part bench and part chair seating) was comfy, but it was also so large that we had a hard time passing items and hearing conversation.     All in all, we spent $600 for the five of us, with minimal drinking.   We left full, but somehow less than satisfied.  You can easily find a better meal for far less.  And a more interesting one too."}
{"text":"Great food, decent service overall. Service could definitely be better and more attentive to dining guests. Some servers seemed to have a chip on their shoulder when interacting with the dining public..   Restrooms were woefully inadequate. They were in dire need of care, they were filthy and had sticky floors. They only had one urinal and two bathroom stalls for a restaurant that, prospectively accommodates upwards of one hundred patrons, aside from that, the food was great.   Thank you!"}
{"text":"First time at Eddie Vs in Scottsdale quarter. Will certainly not be my last. We met up with friends from fountain hills and had the most wonderful time. Jillian is an exceptional bartender. She made our visit fun and entertaining. The crab cakes were suggested from a regular that said they were the best he has ever had. He was so right! Large  lump crab, not a lot of fillers, remoulade was perfect. Definitely will return. Friends has the oysters and were also quite happy."}
{"text":"AMAZING.... our new favorite spot.  Tesla parking/charging right outside the front door.  Lovely ambiance at the bar w/live music.  Eduardo did us right... crab cake takes the gold medal, as does the parm crusted sole... truffle mac/cheese... can't wait to go back!  Oysters didn't impress me, but everything else was so wonderful, I let it slide."}
{"text":"The new 8,800-square-foot Eddie V's at Scottsdale Quarter includes three separate private dining rooms, in addition to the main dining areas, each with its own unique personality.  One room is dramatically situated in a round rotunda, where my partner and I had a wonderfully romantic dinner. Soft live jazz music played softly in the background while we enjoyed a cross section of delightful menu items.  Dinner was truly memorable with a starter of Tuna Tartare. Beautiful sashimi quality tuna was set an top of diced mango then topped with just the slightest amount of sliced chile. The heat was mild and only helped to accentuate the sweetness of the fish and mango. This was followed up by a gorgeous long plate filled with a mix of lightly dusted flash fried calamari, julienne carrots and daikon drizzled with a sweet soy glaze. My entree was on the lighter side but was heavy on flavor. Crab Stuffed Shrimp were excellent; extra large shrimp were grilled then topped with sweet crab meat, panko bread crumbs and a lime finish. I couldn't stop eating there plump crustaceans. I did however stop long enough to try my partners perfectly tender Steak au Poivre.  Dessert was a new take on an old classic, Bananas Foster Cake. As our waiter dumped brandy on top of the cake and set it on fire, even head in the dining room was on us, was quite a sight. The cake was the best finish to a extraordinary evening of food and romance."}
{"text":"I recently dined here on a business trip and really enjoyed the experience.  We started with the steak and lobster tartare flavored with truffle oil and it was delicious, probably the best tartare I've ever had. It was so smooth and succulent I wish we had ordered more! I had the swordfish steak with chile and crab for my entree and the flavors came together so scrumptiously, I was disappointed when I cleared my plate. We shared a brussel sprouts and bacon side and that too was cooked to perfection.  With some prodding, we split a Bananas Foster Flambe with 151, and omg. Amazing. I would go back just for the dessert (but the rest of the food was amazing too).   A solid dinner spot in AZ that apparently has chains across the country, would definitely return."}
{"text":"Not a huge fan, overrated , ambience is nice but food is ok, was there a few times for private events, service is ok but was not impressed by the food at all especially the prices. Much better options available within close proximity"}
{"text":"Great choices on the happy hour menu with plenty of food and wine to choose from. Happy hour until 7pm on weekends. I've never had a bad meal here. The lobster was plentiful and delicious. The sea bass was the best my husband ever tasted. Service will far exceed your expectations and all staff are friendly."}
{"text":"Food was outstanding but service not so much. 1 bottle of wine for 2 people entire 3 hours we were there. Yes, dinner was almost 3 hours as very busy and service was slow. 4 stars due to the food being absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"Always an great meal with impeccable service. It's my father's favorite restaurant in town, and definitely the place for that celebration dinner.   On my last visit, ended up splitting a filet with 4 scallops (they will add as many scallops you want to any dish) and that was a perfect surf and turf experience for us.   Amazingly varied and deep wine list for those that are interested. They have something for everyone there.   Found the asparagus and hollandaise sauce to be a bit unimaginative for the price you're paying for it. Would probably skip that and pick up another one of their sides. Overall I think their appetizers shine more than their side dishes."}
{"text":"part of a social event, we only had app's here. quite delicious crab cakes and a shrimp fritters with mango sauce. the portions were gigantic and actually big enough for a meal. i was slightly full afterwards. part of the roaring fork, wildfish franchise, they also offer a great happy hour. seems a bit high priced but our bill was taken care of, so i'd save this (for the middle class foodie) for a special event."}
{"text":"I had seared tuna and 4 glasses of wine at 15.00 per glass...I had a great time but my bf was so mad about the prices, that im pretty sure we will never go back."}
{"text":"Excellent seafood & steak. The filet with foie gras & madeira sauce was delicious, cooked to perfection. The mac & cheese with truffles was very tasty, too. Great ambience. Perfect service!"}
{"text":"Wonderfuk seafood, except the scalopes which are filled with sand, which make your teeth feel gritty afterwards.    I recommend an Oscar preperation of the surf and turf.   The calamari has a tasty spice derived from thai peppers and sweet sauce.   Recommend happyhour to save, dinner is good for a special occasion, however the bar appears to be more fun with the live jazz."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Nicer than we expected, so we were a bit under dressed (having just come from a show at PPG Paints Arena), but we were still treated well and no one seemed offended by our attire.  The food was out of this world - every bit of it. Seasoned well and delicious. The service was spectacular. If you're going out to celebrate and are willing to spend a bit more for better food, this is a good choice. The desserts were amazing, too!  The one guest coming in had trouble finding the restaurant parking and someone actually went out to park his car for him. Stellar customer service."}
{"text":"We had high expectations for Eddie V's and we were not disappointed.  A neighbor recommended the restaurant and we read the Yelp and Google reviews and my wife decided this is where she wanted to take me for my birthday dinner.  We were seated promptly and our waiter Troy was very pleasant as well as knowledgeable about the menu.    The food was outstanding.  My wife and I ordered the crab cake for an appetizer and then we both ordered the Georges Bay scallops for dinner with a side of crab fried rice.  Everything was melt in our mouths good.  Troy knew how to be the perfect waiter - he has very helpful and attentive and chatted with us but was not intrusive at all.  He asked what brought us to the restaurant so we told him our neighbor had recommended it and that it was my birthday dinner.  Later, when he brought the dessert menu he said that the dessert would be compliments of the restaurant for my birthday.  We did not expect that but it was very nice.    With the dessert, my wife ordered a somewhat exotic drink and when Troy brought it to our table he explained that the bar did not have blenders that night because of the live music that was about to begin, so the drink was just on the rocks.  He apologized and said the restaurant would not charge us for the drink if my wife didn't like it.  My wife wasn't fond of the drink because she said it didn't taste the way it should because it wasn't made in the blender, but it wasn't a big deal.  Troy asked her about the drink and she said it was OK and he said he would take it off the bill.  I asked him to leave it on the bill as we would gladly pay for it.    When Troy brought the bill, he mentioned that he did not put the drink on the bill, even though he appreciated that we were willing to pay for it.  Again, we did not expect that.  The food and service were superb.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Just left there.   Sampled about 4 appetizers plus cocktails.  Bring your wallet, but very tasty.    Especially enjoyed the Maine Lobster tacos. Located in the beautiful Union trust Building.   You must take a stroll into the main lobby to view the rotunda."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic time here on our most recent vacation to Scottsdale.  We had made reservations in advance online, and when we got there, we were a little early but that was no problem as we were readily seated at the oyster bar for happy hour until our table was ready.  Our first round of drinks were the Mojito and the Smokey Old Fashioned.  The presentation and depth of the old fashioned was amazing, one of the best I've had.  We got seated 10 min early , and moved to the dining room where we had the pleasure of being a guest of Dan O's for the night.  Excellent gentleman, great insight to the menu and his recommendations were spot on. Made for a truly great evening.  For the appetizer we had the steak / lobster tartare which was well plated, delicate, and extremely flavorful.  Main course was the Parmesan Sole and Swordfish Steak with lump crab.  Sides were sweet corn and sautéed spinach with garlic and Parmesan shavings.  Both meals were incredible, delicious, and the whole night from start to finish was top notch. Only downside, we stuffed ourselves so much, no room for Banana Fosters but next time. Def coming back."}
{"text":"The lighting here is quite dark so watch your step. For the first course I ordered the shrimp cocktail it came with an atomic horse radish. It is comparable to any other high end steakhouse. I followed this with the Fuji Apple salad which was crisp and delicious. I especially enjoyed the lemon dressing which was very light and crisp. For the main course I ordered the Chilean Sea-Bass with truffle Mac and cheese and lobster mashed potatoes. I had the sea bass pan seared instead of the ponzu broth. I do not particularly care for wet fish. The fish was as expected, perfect! The highlight of the night for me was the mashed potatoes and the generous amounts of lobster. The Mac and cheese was too aromatic for me. Overall, this place is pretty classy and delicious."}
{"text":"Fantastic !   Went last night with a date. On a Monday night it was deadly quite ( Which is fantastic ) . The music was by an jazz/cover band, BUT they played a mix of current slow songs and they possibly could hold a concert on their own. They were that good. For the order there was Halibut and Sea bass- side of  tomato salad and truffle mac n cheese. Everything was beyond perfect. My fish was cooked to perfection. Moist and melted in my mouth.   The service was great, and she came back at the perfect times. Would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Have been a regular for years. Steak and sea bass best ever. I can't think of anything negative. Music is great .  Service superb and servers work together as a team. Our server Anna has it together and made sure we were happy."}
{"text":"I should have known that after a mediocre experience at Wildfish a few months ago that I probably wouldn't love Eddie V's. My dining experience at Eddie V's last night does not make me want to run back.  The interior is really nicely done especially with the dim lighting. It gives it an upscale ambiance with a romantic twist.  The patio is nice for dining outside in the evening...unfortunately last night there was a group of screaming children running around in the park below which kind of killed the relaxing mood.  As a friend pointed out, the \"reserved\" signage for tables has a lot to be desired. I know it's a small detail that most people would overlook, but when a place is trying to be upscale, those little details matter. It was an ugly black placard with white block lettering...I would have expected a simple white placard with calligraphy instead.  Our server was nice enough but spacy.  She graciously did split the bill between five credit cards which was nice. However, she wasn't as attentive as we would have liked or expected, and she failed to mention that adding chicken to one caesar salad costs $10, making the cost of the salad $14 (that was the happy hour price...normally adding the chicken would have made the salad $18!) When we questioned her about it when we got the bill, she had a half-hearted explanation and was not apologetic at all for forgetting to mention that \"minor\" detail.  My friend would not have ordered the chicken if she had known what the cost would have been!  Also, we asked at least three times for a refill on our bread and we never received more bread at all. Again, I expected more from Eddie V's.  I will say that the bright spot in the dining experience was that the crabcakes were 110% better than the ones I had at Wildfish.  The ones at Eddie V's had no filler and tons of lump crabmeat that was really good. The remoulade was tasty and complimented the crab well. I didn't try the shrimp dish that we ordered but my friends who tried it seemed to like it quite well as there were no leftovers! Sundays and Mondays are happy hour all evening long, so drinks are $1 off and other items are 1/2 off.  Our bill totaled $103, which included 5 glasses of wine, 1 iced tea, 5 salads (including the one with the $10 chicken add on), 2 crab cake dishes, and 1 shrimp dish.  I don't think any of the other four ladies I dined with or myself left feeling very impressed.  Despite the delicious crabcakes, I am not sure I will be racing back to Eddie V's. There are better dining options at DC Ranch."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is beyond amazing, the ambiance is so chic & the service!....Colton was my server & he was spot on! Very personable & proactive. When I return for my bday, I'm specifically asking for him! He made my first visit a success. Didn't meet the chef but I know my scallops were cooked to perfection. I rarely leave reviews but to not do so this time would be selfish, I had to share!"}
{"text":"We've been waiting for a few months to get to this place. Our schedule just has not allowed us the time until tonight. Our reservations were for 5:15 PM. We arrived at 5:05 PM and was seated immediately. Yes they have a coat check. The place was very clean and very classy. Our waitress, Alex, was very attentive, helpful, and knowledgeable about the menu. Our meal overall was excellent. The Chilean Seabass and the Crabcake were a 10 out of 10. The lobster mashed potatoes was also 10 out of 10. A few fresh oysters were very good but I didn't want to lose my appetite for the main course. The brussels sprouts were a little dry and could have used a little more olive oil. The sautéed spinach could have been cooked a little longer. I highly recommend this place for a classy meal. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This has to be my new \"It\"'spot! Everything inside was great! The Valet parking had some snags at the end of the night when it came to getting our vehicle but overall it was a perfect night. I recently tore my patellar Tendon and was on crutches and they went beyond to make sure I was comfortable. The Food was superb and nothing short of excellent! I should have taken the high road and tried more of their seafood but nothing is wrong starting off with Steak and I can tell you pound for pound - dollar for dollar this is better than Capital Grill. The live Music and very high level decor with excellent staff was just outstanding, it's not fair to the other competitors in the Area - I still Love Eddie Merlots but Capital goes 3rd! I need about 3 more visits and pictures but first impressions are lasting - hats off to the Owner"}
{"text":"Eddie V's has always been a interesting spot. The crowd is usually a mix between 60 something year old men and their 22 year old dates and regular business types.   I came in for happy hour one afternoon and unfortunately the bar area was full but I was able to snag a seat at the oyster bar with my friend. We were greeted quickly and each started out with a glass of wine. I ordered the Louis Martini Cabernet Sauvignon which was bold and flavorful. For food we opted for the market oysters, jumbo lump crab cake, grilled shrimp, and the lobster tacos. Everything came out fresh and was coursed perfectly so we didn't have too much in front of us at once. I'm a huge fan of conscientiousness when it comes to timing so that was really great of them. The mignonette served with the oysters added such a perfect flavor and the crabcake was seriously killer. They do not mess around with the amount of crab you get especially for the happy hour price.  My only complaint has to do with the service for the first half of our dining experience. While he was polite and attentive our server kept touching the small of my back every time he came over which made me feel really uncomfortable. I didn't make any comments about it but we ended up somehow getting a new female server for the duration of the meal and everything was perfect!"}
{"text":"Superb food and service. Wonderful ambiance, with a perfect mix of fun bar with live music, nice dinner room. Canno find one fault. Would return in a heartbeat"}
{"text":"A couple nights ago I went to Eddie V's for my brother's birthday. (A Thursday) He raves about this place yet I always remember the other location being just ok. Anyway, the atmosphere of the new location is nice. About what you would expect...dark and cozy, however....the bathrooms are well...creepy? There are no doors on the mens or women's bathrooms. Women can walk right by the mens bathroom and see everything. They are more like big open rooms with a sink on one side. It was eerily silent with off putting lighting. You almost feel like you're in a creepy, dank hotel lobby. I couldn't wait to get out of there and back to my table. Oh and ladies, FYI...we can hear EVERYTHING you are saying. The two bathrooms share one large space.  Ok so let's get on to the meal. Before I came to Eddie's, I checked out the yelp reviews like I always do before I go to a new restaurant and made sure to try the crab cake. And let me tell you, everyone is correct. It's DELICIOUS. I just about licked the plate clean...and i'm not even a big seafood fan. Now, on to the main course. The whole reason my brother wanted to come to Eddie's was for an amazing steak. So both he and I ordered steak. He got the special which was a bone in filet mignon and I ordered the bone out filet mignon. We like our steaks cooked medium, pink all the way thru with no red. We always ask the server, regardless of where we go, what their version of medium is. He told us that their medium would be to our liking so we trusted that an excellent steakhouse would get it right......NOPE. Both $35+ steaks came out medium rare to RARE. My filet had ribbons of fat throughout the whole thing. Horrible cut of meat. I've had better cuts of meat at Outback. ZING! Everyone knows that when you order a steak and it's not cooked properly that it just ruins your meal. By the time they re-cook the SAME piece of meat its a charred burnt crisp. I decided to just eat mine but my brother sent it back and they STILL didn't get it right. Oh, on a side note, If you DO have a problem with your meat, the manager will come over with a light BLUE LED flashlight and inspect it like a medical autopsy. I mean come on...it made the meat look purple. GROSS. As far as my poor cut of meat...the manager could only say \"we use the best cuts of meat\" really?   Our waiter was nice, my only gripe about the service was that our plates were taken away from us from the bus boy without being asked if we were done yet. BIG NO NO.   In conclusion, The manager took the birthday boy's steak off the check. There was no special treatment for the occasion. I read in one review that someone got a birthday card signed by all the staff. That never happened. I gave Eddie's two stars instead of one only because of the crab cake. I will never come back here for steak. I suggest sticking with the seafood items.  UPDATE:  We received a credit to come back, hoping they could cook a filet correctly. THEY DID IT AGAIN! The can not properly cook a piece of meat. End of story. 1 star now."}
{"text":"Went here for happy hour with a gal pal and her gal pal, who was from out of town.   I invited a male friend, who had only been in town seven weeks, so trying to get him introduced to all the valley has to offer.  We reserved our table, which was perfect, right next to the musicians.  I had the business card for the musicians -- a pianist and two others -- but, alas, I can't find it.   Okay.  Yes, I think  I actually threw it out. ...  But they were good.  The pianist was quite entertaining cause she and my gal pals hit it off.  We ordered the ahi tuna tartare, point judith calamari, salt and pepper shrimp, filet banh mi sliders and for dessert -- drum roll -- two orders of the godiva cake.  Our male companion had the calamari.  I think I'll order that next time.   Looked good.   I didn't get a chance to taste it, but. ...  I had the ahi tuna tartare, and the other two each had the sliders and the shrimp.  We ordered a wide range of drinks, one of which I gave to the pianist, since I was driving home.   It was the vodka martini, which was perfect!     We all tasted the cake with its vanilla ice cream.   YUMMMM!!!  The best.  Yes, I'll be back. ..."}
{"text":"One of the best in town for sure. Incredible service every time. Most often I don't even have to tell the server what I want...they just know. Also, they always seem to cook my steak perfectly (hope I don't jinx that one). The lobster potsticker and calamari appetizers are the best!  Try a NY strip steak, super char crusted on the outside and medium (or medium rare) w/ Bearnaise sauce. AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"While the dining room is nice to dine in I really like the high top tables in the bar and the LIVE music!  They offer a great happy hour special on drinks and appetizers.  My favorite dish is the Kung Pow Calamari!"}
{"text":"Ordered the 22 oz bone in steak and thought it was average at best. The appetizers were good. Felt the creme brûlée was below average. The sugar was very soft indicating it was fired a long time before preparation."}
{"text":"I've been to the new place a couple of times now for happy hour.  Love the crab cake and the pot stickers are good too.  A little bit of an older crowd.  Get here by 5 PM to get a seat at the bar."}
{"text":"Another SUPERB experience last night. My wife and I came here after the Cardinals victory (a tradition) and we had a 5-star meal from start to finish. We started with a half dozen Blue Point oysters which were large and flavorful. For our meals we had scallops and bone-in filet mignon--both excellent. As a side we orders the crab fried rice, which may be the best fried rice dish we've ever had. Soooo good! And the finale of the night was the Baba's Foster butter cake, which was to die for!!  Staff is equally exceptional. Our server Pablo had served us before months ago and remembered us.  Can't say enough great things about Eddie V's. It is our favorite fine dining spot in all of Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Last minute Sunday night dinner for 2.  No reservations and we were seated right away.  We chose to sit in the dining room rather than the lounge.  Excellent food,  excellent service!  The Chilean Sea Bass and truffled mac n cheese were cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"Been there twice Waited over 30 mins each time with resv Ran out of 8 oz filets Jan 17 Fab service  Fab food"}
{"text":"Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their meals and the overall evening-from the drinks, salads and apps to the deserts. We had the shrimp, sea bass, tuna, and swordfish as well as a ribeye covered with oysters and béarnaise-awesome. We also had a bunch of sides and a few deserts and enjoyed them all. Our server Mike and his team were excellent and made our occasion extra special. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Eddie V's was the best dining experience I've had. I had the pleasure of celebrating my birthday here and it was phenomenal. A birthday was mentioned in the reservation and they did a great job celebrating it. We had the best seat in the house. The table was decorated with confetti and i had a hand written birthday card.  We enjoyed 2 delicious glasses of wine.  For dinner i enjoyed the swordfish steak. It was topped with a great mix of crab meat & avocado. I ordered a side of their brussel sprouts. Delicious and buttery. Also included bacon pieces.  My husband ordered the 2 tier shellfish. It is intended for a shared option but he ordered it as his main meal. It had 2 lobster tails, oysters (east & west coast) , delicious jumbo shrimp and 4 different sauces and crab meat. It was served looking awesome (see picture)  My server bought my dessert. I ordered the well talked about bananas foster dessert. It had happy birthday written on it in chocolate. The waiter lit the 151 rum at the table  to caramelize the bananas perfectly. The dessert was beyond phenomenal... Literally the most melt in your mouth, amazing dessert.  They made me feel like a queen on my birthday. We had an amazing time. Server was beyond kind. He gave us his business card so that he can serve us another time.  Valet is $8 and well worth it.  Treat yourself. This was a great experience"}
{"text":"Wow is all I can say. Tucked away in the Scottsdale Quarter (*hint park in north garage). The bruschetta appetizer and the mini crab cakes were fantastic. Hot loaf of sourdough bread crispy. I opted for the clam/corn chowder that was flavorful with every spoonful. I did have the filet, an 8 ounce piece of tender deliciousness. Grilled to medium rare and juicy. The family style sides of mashed potatoes, broccoli and I think a macaroni and or cauliflower cheese was also great. Now for dessert. Bananas foster sweet and very flavorful. There was also a chocolate cake with hot chocolate sauce. Each family style shareable came with a scoop of ice cream. I, of course ate too much but at least I have dinner for tomorrow night! For a special night out go to Eddie V's."}
{"text":"I have been going to Eddie Vs for 15 years. This is the first time I was disappointed.  Might have been because it was New Years Eve, but that shouldn't be an excuse. They need to refresh the menu."}
{"text":"We went for happy hour.  The ambiance was fantastic.  The live music was great we sat right next to them and I have sensitive ears and the noise level was perfect.  The service was top notch.  The food was not the best and the portions were small.  The mac and cheese is dry but editable,  we also shared snapper I think. Lack of seasoning but the food came out hot.  The wine selection is great. I had a couple of their signature mixed drinks very nice. Oh yah we had half a dozen oysters. I felt like they just got them from the ocean. ..fresh"}
{"text":"Great spot for business dinners or an old school traditional date dinner. Great food, highly impressive wine selection and impeccable service."}
{"text":"Great experience for my birthday. Got sat at our reservation time. Wait staff was excellent. Manager checked on us multiple times. Food was spectacular. Great wine list. Live music in the bar."}
{"text":"Since my previous reviews, I must take off a couple of stars. My first visit several months ago for my birthday was excellent, but during my last two visits, the employees have made many mistakes. Last time, my crab cake contained shell, my lobster bisque contained no lobster, and my salad contained no walnuts. This time, the staff knocked my expensive fur coat on the floor and I had to pick it up, and my filet mignon that was supposed to be medium was rare. A manager apologized to another person at my table, but he did not even look at me! I just ate the exterior of the red steak rather than wait for a new one. A few of the side vegetables were complimentary, probably because of my friend's messed-up order and the fact that vegetables cost less than the filet mignon."}
{"text":"Beautiful space with attentive servers. The portions are very large for fine dining. We started with the calamari which came highly recommended, west coast oysters (the ones at Off the Hook are better) and the apple salad (big enough to split). For dinner we ordered the bronzino, parmesan sole, ahi tuna and the special ribeye. Can't complain  about any of the entrees and the steak was cooked perfectly (probably the best steak in Pittsburgh). We were told that 3 sides would be good for 3 people, we order 2 (scalloped potatoes and broccolini) and had more than half of each to take home. Dessert portions were ginormous.   Minor hiccups - had to wait a little for a table that we had a reservation for and the drinks from the bar were slow."}
{"text":"I wanted to try a nice restaurant to finish off a week-long family trip.    Eddie V's had great reviews so I made reservations for a Saturday night.    The interior is upscale.  The wait staff is plentiful.   The food was good but not over the top memorable (considering the prices).  Our waiter was efficient but not the least bit friendly or welcoming.  Food: - Heirloom Tomato Salad - minimal cheese, tomatoes were not memorable - Lobster tacos - excellent - Caesar Salad - ok    - Halibut , Salmon - ok  - Bone-in ribeye - very good  - Eddie V's Special Rice - too rich  - Truffle mac & cheese - pasta was good but not enough cheese  - Brussels sprouts - over cooked  There are other restaurants we would rather go to if we are going to spend that kind of money."}
{"text":"They have vallet service right in front of the door.  There is an oyster bar that's pretty small and a bar with music.  Nice menu with your standard seafood steakhouse type dishes.  The portions are nice sized and the crab fried rice as a side but it's a must try.  The fish is fresh, the steak nicely cooked and the desserts are great.  The bananas foster butter cake is my fave."}
{"text":"I hate to say this, but after my experience at Eddie V's last night, I think they've gone down hill...  There was a lot of miscommunication - here's why:  Upon walking in, we were pleased to see that they still offer all night happy hour on Sundays and Mondays.  (Their happy hour = 1/2 off most appetizers and I believe drink specials too).  The hostess asked us for our name and we responded that we didn't have a  reservation; that we were just going to eat and drink in the bar area. She was not the friendliest, and just nodded.  Side note - no reservation was needed as the restaurant was not busy!  So, we sat in the bar area and when the waiter came to take our order (we were a group of 4), we placed several appetizer orders right off the bat and said that would be good to start and we'd add more to the order in a bit.  We also ordered drinks.  I specifically ordered my new favorite 'black cherry effen vodka with soda.'  So when the waiter came back with the news that they were out of black cherry effen and didn't carry it anymore, I was a little disappointed.  No big deal though, I went with the 3 Olives Cherry Vodka instead WITH SODA.    Waiter comes back with the drinks and mine  looks like cherry coke.  I taste it and sure enough. he's given me a cherry vodka with diet coke - no clue where that came from, but he took it back and brought me (finally) what I ordered.  In the meantime. he came over and asked if we were ready to order... When we asked if the first round would be out soon, he said he didn't put it in yet as he did not think we were serious when we put the first round in.  Ugh - not funny when you're with 2 very hungry men :)  We ended up ordering more and were all hungry for the first round of scallops, ahi tuna, mixed green/pear/goat cheese salad, corn and crab chowder. and crab cake.  In the meantime, we were given bread and butter, but alas, no silverware, app plates, or napkins... no big deal - we got those within a couple of minutes.    We were so happy with the first round. (except for the soup which we all agreed tasted like water and potatoes so we sent it back) that we decided to order more... another scallops. another ahi tuna, a tuna tartare, broiled oysters with a spinach and artichoke fondue, and a steak.  This time, it took an extremely long time for our food to arrive and when it did, the scallops were presented totally different and the ahi was overcooked.  Also, the waiter thought we ordered raw oysters and not the broiled ones...  At that point, we were done - no need to attempt to correct the order.  The soup and ahi were removed from the bill (as they should've been - we did send them back).    I have to say, aside from the company, this meal was just mediocre.  I've had great meals at Eddie V's in the past, and hopefully this was just an 'off' evening, but I will not be running back anytime in the near future!  Sorry, Eddie V - only 3 stars this time...our meal was a comedy of errors and even with happy hour all night, not worth the $$!"}
{"text":"I was visiting Scottsdale from Chicago and wanted to get some good food.    Had the ribeye hear and everything was fantastic.  The steak was cooked perfectly and the creamed spinach was very flavorful.  The service was also excellent and they had good wine recommendations.  Definitely lived up to the 5 star rating."}
{"text":"The BEST Bartender Jillian has been moved to tables :(  We have always come to Eddie V's to sit at the bar where the action is and have Jillian helps/serves us.  Now we must sit on the sidelines at a table because we will have no other server than Jillian.  She is amazing!   So helpful with suggestions!  Always remembers our name and what you drink!  Please put her back behind the bar so we can enjoy our experience as we always have at Eddie V's."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here last weekend for a special night out, but I was let down.   It usually really bothers me when people complain about the service at nice places not being immaculate because no one's perfect. I generally avoid such complaints and focus on the food. This is going to be an exception to the rule.   It all started with the BUG in my husband's water! A dead floating little bug! I expect better at a place like this on a nice night out. When we told the waiter, he simply whisked the glass away, softly stating he'd bring him right out a new glass. No apologies, no acknowledgement that anything was out of the ordinary... is this how nice places handle mistakes of this nature? Just fix it and don't dwell? I can appreciate a quick fix of such a disturbing issue, but we were put off by how it was handled. On top of it, we definitely felt neglected from that point forward. The waiter for the tables around us spent time with his tables going over the options in a friendly manner... Maybe after the bug he figured he wasn't going to be able to recover a good tip so why bother with us? It was very awkward.   Overall, the food was pretty good. The tuna tartare was OK, but not amazing. I had the Nantucket Bay scallop special feature in part because the combination mentioned on the website's menu page intrigued me - scallops, brown butter, almonds and grapes with chives. What they actually brought out had tomatoes instead of grapes and no chives. It was still quite tasty, but left me feeling a bit deceived and wondering what I was missing. We also got the crab fried rice everyone raves about here, but it was shocked at how spicy it was when it said nothing about this on the menu. It was OK, but  I couldn't taste the crab at all because of the spice, which was disappointing because I love crab. Also, the Asian flavors were out of place in combination with my meal, and I had wished the waiter would have counseled us on our choices a bit more. My husband got the steak au poivre that we loved at Wildfish. I wasn't impressed this time, but he still enjoyed it. The bananas foster dessert was spectacular though - don't miss it!  After these issues, this place will not be on my list of places to return, which is a shame because I work 1 minute away. :-("}
{"text":"I'm sure there is a reason why everyone is giving this restaurant 5 stars and wish I had the same experience, but unfortunately that was not the case. We've been to this restaurant many times before in California and it's always been great - so naturally we were excited when it opened up right up the street from us. We usually have date night every Friday night and decided to go to Eddie V's a few Friday's ago. We called and the reservations were booked until 9:30. We said that was fine and we'd come in then. We walked to dinner and arrived at 9:40. We were seated within minutes. The vibe was awesome. So far so good. Then our waiter showed up about 15 mins later - which is quite some time to wait for a waiter for an initial greeting. He finally showed up and asked for our drinks orders, my bf put in a drink and I asked if I could sample one of the Roses prior to purchasing the bottle. He said sure and went missing for 15 mins. Then after flagging him down and reminding him, he came back with my boyfriends drink and my sample. I told him that I'd just do the glass. He said sure and he'd be right back. We sat around for about an additional 15 mins until I flagged him down AGAIN, and asked \"Can I get my wine?\", rather than saying \"Oh no, I am so sorry for the delay!\", he answered \"Sure\" in a monotone voice. He comes back about 10 mins later and my boyfriend and I could finally CHEERS! At this point his drink was warm... He said he'd be right back to take our order - once again, gone for 15 mins. We had to flag down a different waitress that was passing through who was super nice and took our order to relay to our waiter.   Then the food came out - 30 mins later. Calamari was over cooked. Salad was ok. Au gratin potatoes were good. Steak was good. Fish was good.   Overall, the food was ok - something we'd come back for and try different items on the menu. However, the service was the worst we've both experienced EVER and we dine out quite often - all over the world. The server never once expressed an apology, just a \"Can I get you another drink? I promise it wont take 30 mins this time.\" And blamed it on the bar guy - saying they were very backed up. Which if that was the case, and the bar guy really was that backed up, to pour a simple glass of wine, come back and check in on us, don't leave us hanging for 20 mins at a time.   Very very very disappointed."}
{"text":"We went last night for the first time since it opened. There were 3 of us. The drinks, service, food, appetizers, and decor were all quite remarkable. We go out every Saturday night. This is my new favorite place. They have the best crab fried rice I have ever had in my life. It was better than any fried rice in a Chinese or Japanese restaurant. That's hard to believe but very true. I highly recommend going to try it. It won't disappoint. I'm looking forward to Christmas Eve dinner here."}
{"text":"Wonderful!!!! The food is flavorful! We started with Big Eddie tower. What a presentation!! It came with 2 whole lobsters, maybe a dozen tiger shrimps, oysters, king crab legs on top, and the ahi tuna poke. We also had the sea bass and the lobster bisque. Service was awesom!°"}
{"text":"The ambience and the service are fantastic! The hospitality of our servers was 2nd to none. The dining room and restrooms are very modern and clean. As the food goes: the bread was fresh, warm, and delicious with flavored soft butter. The calamari was perfect, well seasoned, and simply delicious.  The lobster bisque was bland. The bone in ribeye was just ok. The sea bass special was also just ok. It was a very nice evening with great company in a beautiful restaurant with amazing service. The main dishes have opportunity."}
{"text":"Eddie V is Eddie V.   What else can you say. Listen this place is differently for an sophisticated crowd.    You walk in and the warmth of dim lights sooth you.  A calm comes over you as you look across  to a massive glass case filled with an elite selection of wines and spirits from all around the world.   Your seated by the host who has a sweet smile.  She walks you to an impeccable table set up.  The waiter runs behind her to announce the daily specials.   I ordered the crab cake and my husband ordered the fish tacos.  Everyone knows I love seafood. So if your going to claim your the place for steak and seafood you better come correct.    Wellll they sure did!... the crab cake was the best I ever had and I've had a lot of crab cakes in my time.  This crab cake was all crab with very little breading just like I like it.....  My husband's fish tacos was so moist and delicious I couldn't help but to eat off  his plate.  Okay now let's talk dessert..... BANANA FOSTER... is the best I've ever had... WAIT I said that already but it's true. When the waiter lite the Banana Foster it blew up in flames.  My eyes danced as the flames died down and I took a bite.....heavenly delicious....   This place is definitely worth going too but know that you will spend $ but the dining experience is be worth it.  Any special occasion or just a Friday after work having a drink. This is a must go to place!"}
{"text":"We went to Eddie V on a Friday. It was our first time eating here and we brought our friends who live out of town. Everything from the hostess sitting us earlier than our reservation was for to our dessert was impeccable.   Our service was AMAZING! She did a wonderful job and it made our meal much better. I had the 8oz filet, which was very tender and rich with flavor. The table ordered 3 small plates, the spinach with garlic and Parmesan cheese was very good. The twice baked potato was very large, delicious, but a little to heavy for a lady to consume herself.   Lastly, the banana foster was my favorite. It was a huge dessert so it can be shared. The cake was moist with slices of banana, whipped cream on the side and ice cream. We also order the Godiva chocolate cake, it was very good but way to rich.   The restaurant decor is stunning! I loved the glass wine room in the middle of the restaurant, and the bathrooms were very clean and chic.   Our experience was 5 stars because of our delicious food and impeccable service. I would take family here when visiting and also bring all my big celebrations here as well. The food is worth the price you pay!!! I will continue to recommend Eddie V's to friends in the future."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate an achievement and have to say, it was one of the best dining experiences I've ever had.   We had the choice of sitting in the dining area or the \"lounge\" area and opted for the latter. There was a bar, high-top tables, booths, more festive lighting than the dining area, as well as live jazz music. The musicians were great and made the night fun for us!  Service was great from beginning to end. Started off with bread/butter and a couple drinks. The Maverick cocktail was delicious and refreshing, garnished with cucumber and a jalapeño. We ordered a half-dozen oysters, of which they had a decent variety. These weren't anything exceptional but they got the job done.   The real winner here was the meal. We ordered a 12 oz. filet mignon steak with a cognac-peppercorn creme sauce, the Norwegian salmon, a side of asparagus with hollandaise, and a side of broccolini. The steak was beautifully cooked to medium-rare and almost dissolved in mouth. With the cognac-peppercorn sauce it was incredibly delicious and we wanted to get another one! The salmon was flaky and cooked perfectly. Albeit a bit fishy, it was accompanied with vegetables and a mustard vinaigrette which definitely elevated the meal. We cleaned both plates!   A huge shoutout also to our waitress, who upon hearing of the achievement we were celebrating, brought us a dessert...on her! We chose the butterscotch panna cotta and I think it was the best dessert I've ever had. The caramel-like butterscotch sauce danced effortlessly with the panna cotta and walnuts. The dessert included a coconut macaroon and a biscuit, which we used to mop up the chocolate sauce \"Congratulations\" written on the plate. A perfect ending to our meal!"}
{"text":"Welp, I see the Phoenix Yelp Elites were sent here in full force; at least this time they got it right...EDDIE V's is a 5 STAR RESTAURANT!  EDDIE V's  Eddie V's was stablished in 2001. Eddie V's has a charismatic vibe draws you in and holds you close, invites you to be seen, or sit back and just savor. They have the finest seafood and steaks, world-class wine and service. And live jazz in the V lounge. Seafood is what they're known for, but their specialty is excellence. Devotion to excellence is the guiding principle in all that they do, and they strive to go above and beyond in every step of preparation.   Eddie V's Motto: \"To prepare the finest meal you've ever had.\"  THE STORY & SERVICE EXPERIENCE  We decided Eddie V's was the place. Honestly, I hadn't heard of Eddie V's, but it sounded like I would love it, so I said yes.  We were seated at a nice booth right in the middle of the restaurant. Perfect.  Our server, Eduardo, started us off with cocktails. I already loved it here.  Next, I tried the lobster bisque, followed by the Chilean Sea Bass. The light soy broth the bass was served in was magic in my palate. Absolutely OUTSTANDING.  We ended with the at your table bananas Foster. So much fun and drama! I totally loved it! Unfortunately, Eduardo seemed ready to go home, and got a little crotchity when I asked for an espresso. We were his last table, so it probably was time to go, but whatever. Still a MARVELOUS meal!  CONCLUSION  Eddie V's is EXCELLENT! Definitely a MUST VISIT if you get the chance. I can't wait to go back!  5/5 RECOMMEND  OF NOTE  *Valet Available.  *For more information: eddiev.com"}
{"text":"Eddie Vs is our favorite date night spot. We love sitting in the bar along the back wall at the tables and listening to their amazing music. All their staff is amazing. Never had a bad experience and we go quite often. Highly recommend Eddie Vs."}
{"text":"Eddie V's is probably one of my favorite chain restaurants ever! Especially because I LOVEEE seafood more than anything :) The boyfie really wanted to try this place before we left Pittsburgh so it wasn't hard to say yes :P I like how this location has a separate more \"casual\" dining/bar area. We opted to sit there since we were both in workout clothes LOL.  Ordered: x JUMBO LUMP CRAB CAKE (Sautéed Maryland Style with Spicy Chive Remoulade) - Boyfie can never say no to crab cakes so of course we ordered them. I'm not the biggest fan of crab cakes because of the breading, but these ones are DELICIOUS! Mostly all crab meat and very little fillers. Still one of our favorites next to the ones served at Joe's in Las Vegas. x MAINE LOBSTER TACOS (House-Made Fresh Tortillas with Grilled Sweet Corn Pico) - MMMM the best lobster tacos ever! I remember the tortillas being a little thicker, but these were still good! A MUST order. x BROCCOLINI WITH LEMON AND GARLIC - we ordered a side of this and it was so delicious! You could really taste the lemon on this dish which makes any vegetable taste good :P x CRAB FRIED RICE WITH MUSHROOMS AND SCALLIONS - this was also a side. We ordered the half portion which was still HUGE. Definitely easy to share between two people. I was hoping the crab was mixed into the rice, but they just plopped some on at the top. It was still really good.  We received our tacos and crab cakes fairly quickly, but our rice and broccolini took about 50 minutes which was ridiculous. Our server was super cool about it and took ownership of the delay. He took both off the bill which was great. Truly Eddie V's service. Little things like this will always keep me coming back!"}
{"text":"We have been going to this restaurant frequently for the past two years.  We are on their  e-mail blasts.  They even contacted us personally by telephone to say they have a special promotion starting today:  Ray Charles music from 6:00 PM in the lounge.  We made a reservation for 5:30, rented a car, ate dinner in the lounge, left at 7:05; still no music. We inquired (actually complained)  Manager: Ezra Dylan Saul said \"fine, just don't come back\".  Thank you. We always spend at least $100 each time we're there.  We won't be back!.  The lounge was full of people who were suckered into the bate and switch, as well. No music!  Good promotion!!"}
{"text":"On a Friday night in Scottsdale, there are many dinner choices and chances are, there will be a wait wherever you go.  I made a reservation for Eddie V's via Open Table without issue though, much to my surprise.  Having arrived early, I took a spin around the neighborhood first and it's a lovely shopping/residential area.  It was a gorgeous evening, and the area was packed with people enjoying the nice weather.  When I got to the restaurant I was still early for my reservation so naturally I gravitated to the bar where I enjoyed a glass of Cava.  It was noisy, dim, well-attended by the bartenders.  I loved the ambiance in there - soft live music playing, happy dining sounds all around.    Dinnertime rolls around and I was taken to the table promptly, greeted immediately by a most charming server whose name escapes me.  She went over the specials, made friendly small talk, and knew without looking what kind of rye whiskey they had at the bar - bonus points.  I ordered a Manhattan, and my companion ordered another half-bottle of red wine.  He started his meal with six Miyagi oysters from British Columbia - they smelled like the sea and he enjoyed them very much.  I had a salad of arugula, sauteed mushrooms, and goat cheese dressed with champagne vinaigrette.  Mushrooms and goat cheese: one of my favorite combinations on the planet - and it makes a delicious salad.    Our main courses were comprised of the sea bass special for him (grilled simply with salt, pepper, and olive oil - very tender, flaky, cooked and seasoned perfectly) and the halibut for me (served in a sauce that I wanted to lick from the bowl - despite my desire to do so, my desire to behave like a lady won out).    For dessert (of course there was dessert!) we shared the chocolate cake (dense, deeply chocolaty) with scoops of chocolate ice cream on top (super premium, locally made) - a chocolate lovers dream.    A very indulgent, special occasion dinner to be sure - there is a price tag associated with this kind of decadence, but it was totally worth it.  This is the type of environment I want to be in on a Friday night when I'm on vacation somewhere lovely.  Should I have occasion to be in Scottsdale again, I would be likely to return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great food and music, service was excellent. We had a mix of seafood, all was delicious. Heirloom tomato mozzarella salad is amazing!"}
{"text":"Last year we were at the La Jolla location. This year, we are at the Kierland location. Their Thanksgiving plate is a perfect Thanksgiving meal- Turkey, mashed potatoes, green beans, stuffing, cranberries, gravy, squash and warm bread. Haven't found a meal  this traditional and yummy anywhere else (besides my kitchen of course). Service was excellent too!"}
{"text":"It's so classy here, the attentiveness is in its own category of inventiveness. Lobster bisque like nothing else. My red drum fish was melty tasty and so rich like a catchy red dress. Side accessories of distinctive mushroom convo pieces of all kinds were each so unique - no matter which mushroom was paired with which sides, each mushroom variety was extraordinarily exquisite. Caramel desserts of banana butter cake and panna cotta are two-of-a-class, too. I somehow floated into restaurant week which afforded a chef's menu. Wow.  I could wax candlelit romantic and unforgettable about the ambient detailing..."}
{"text":"Rick was a charismatic and proffessional server. We will be back to specially request him. He was tentative, friendly, respectful and knowledgeable.   The food was phenomenal. Definately a great catch for fresh seafood in Scottsdale with a fine dining experience.   The banana' foster for dessert was mind-blowing. I have always been a fan of Mastro's butter cake, until now. Eddie V's has replaced my favorite dessert with their banana foster dish!!!"}
{"text":"Ate there for bday dinner, amazing. I don't give 5 stars out often but this place is it. King crab melts in mouth as does filet mignon. Pricey so, special occasions only (was $185 for two) but worth it."}
{"text":"My husband and I look forward to the end of the week when we can relax and enjoy an amazing meal. Whenever we don't want to take a chance on a new restaurant dining experience, for fear of being let down, we head to where we know the food is awesome, the service is exceptional, the atmosphere is beautiful and the desert is perfect. Eddie V's never, ever disappoints!  We absolutely love, love, love Eddie V's!"}
{"text":"The perfect restaurant for a special occasion. My fiancé and I celebrated our anniversary by having dinner at Eddie V's. Our server Alex was genuine and attentive. We had the lobster bisque which was tasty, but as other reviews have noted was a bit light on lobster. The Point Judith Calamari was excellent. The roasted cashews were unexpected, but delicious! For the entree he ordered the Chilean Sea Bass and I ordered the George's Bank Scallops. Both entrees were delicious and we thoroughly enjoyed our meals, as well as the shared side dishes--the Crab Fried Rice and the Butter Poached Lobster Mashed Potatoes. For dessert we shared the Hot Chocolate Godiva Cake which was served with vanilla ice cream. I'm not a huge fan of chocolate cake, but it just just the right amount of richness. Our server brought us complimentary glasses of champagne as well! We're fans and will be back in the future for more special occasions!"}
{"text":"What a great time at Eddie V's last night!  Sat at the bar in a completely full restaurant.  Only had to wait a few minutes to grab a couple seats and everyone was super friendly.  Service at the bar was terrific and we enjoyed our dinner right there without needing to wait for a table.  The food was great.  We had their Oysters Rockefeller.  Only two in the order, but they were large and very tasty. We also had a crab cake that was terrific.  For dinner we shared the crab legs and an order of au gratin potatoes.  Like eating a twice baked potato without the skin.  Lots of cheesy goodness! We are light eaters so the smaller portions were perfectly fine for us to share.  The drinks were very good and they are generous so you get value for the price you pay.  We enjoyed meeting some locals - it was a friendly and comfortable atmosphere.  The best parts were the live music and dessert.  The band that played was off the charts!  Awesome, incredible, fantastic!!  We were only steps away so it was like a small venue concert for us.  Loved it!  The dessert was their blackberry cobbler.  Doesn't sound that exciting but it was amazing!  One of the best desserts I've ever had.  Loved their spin on it.  Sorry it was dark and I was too busy enjoying so no pics this time..."}
{"text":"My son picked Eddie V's for his Pitt graduation dinner.  And because our next-door neighbor's daughter was also graduation from Pitt, we invited them to join us.  I made an on-line reservation for 8 and added a note that we were celebrating the accomplishments of our two graduates.  The day before our reservation, I received a call to confirm our plans and was informed that all members of our party needed to be present before we could be seated and that our reservation would be cancelled if we were not seated within 15 minutes of our reservation time.  I wasn't thrilled with getting such a dire warning over the phone but I guess they were packed for the evening.  Our full party made sure we arrived on time.  We were seated in a private alcove and the table was decorated with star confetti for our graduates.  It pays to make a note on the reservation for special occasions.  My sister notified our waiter that she had gluten allergies and he made accommodations for her throughout the meal.  This was truly a five-star experience.  The food and service were outstanding, and the staff really went out of their way to make our graduates feel like they were the most important guests in the house.  They were both sent home with complimentary desserts and the rest of us were treated to a complimentary order of Bananas Foster for sharing.  Yes.. the final bill was an eye-opener, but I had no regrets rewarding the staff for their excellent service.  When we remember this graduation weekend, our meal at Eddie V's will be a prominent part of the conversation."}
{"text":"This place is so YUMMY I live by Yelp and the reviews led me the right way. I took my boyfriend here for his Birthday. Not only was the food amazing our waitress Sara was phenomenal! She was witty fast space and perfect timing. She explained the menu picked the perfect wine and desert. We will be back and we defiantly be requesting Sara! Everything we ate was good couldn't pick a favorite!"}
{"text":"Had the most amazing dinner here last week. Walter at the bar is great! Perfect service. Our dinner was phenomenal. Will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Came here for my coworkers retirement party. The food  was amazing!!! There is certainly class in this restaurant. I love the live band playing as well as we dined our 5 course meal. Amazing!  The Parmesan crusted sole was phenomenal, the crab chowder was out of this world! The oysters on my ... The oysters were out of this world fresh and delicious! The service was excellent and made the whole dinning experience just fantastic ! ;)"}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't already been said. Staff is awesome and food is great. I have been twice and I usually just stick with lobster tail and steak. The truffle macaroni was to die for, that dish is definitely a winner. I can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"Worst experience i've had at a restaurant in a long time. I went here with my boyfriend for Valentine's day and made a reservation weeks in advance because it would be our first one together after doing a year of long distance. The host had us wait around for 20 minutes and never really gave an answer when I asked how long it would be but instead pushed up to the bar. We waited until we were approached by the host again who then tried to seat us but said someone had taken the table and just walked away. Once we finally got our table we weren't given water and didn't see the server until the manager noticed us. By then my boyfriend was upset and just wanted to leave because we had just been ignored for about 40 minutes. Overall it was a huge waste of time and extremely disappointing considering I had planned this weeks in advance."}
{"text":"Had a work dinner in the private dinner room.   Beautiful space (although placement of TV's made it awkward to see the presentation a bit).  Food was phenomenal, I had the sole.  Bathrooms are super trendy and cool (just in case you one of those that care...I am!)  Service on point.  Great experience all the way."}
{"text":"Eddie V's provided us with a nice evening out for my wife, another couple and I. We went Valentine's weekend. So why only three stars. Let me nit-pick a bit. We arrived when it was still light out, sat down and the lighting was immediately annoying. our waiter was helpful with a flashlight, still annoying, way to dark. However I give Eddie a pass as we came from the daylight into darkness. We found a reasonable Oregon Pinot, that was very nice. My appetizer was great Eddie has managed to put some imagination back into Calamari!. Now the hard part, when we go to a top steakhouse serving Prime cuts you expect to pay minimum $110 a head. At this price range one gets to nit-pick. The sides were average the scallop potatoes were a little crunchy, asparagus and hollandaise-bland. As for my New York strip. it was average. there are different levels of Prime. Great steak houses have relationships with ranchers who produce incredible Prime meat. The steak felt like a Costco piece of prime meat. Not a bad piece of meat, definitely prime, but nothing great. My company had similar reactions to their entree and the sides. Also the desert menu needs work. As for the service, Valentine's weekend can be long for these folks so they were a little tired, but the service was ok. Eddie might think about aging their beef. So the good news their prices are not as expensive as lets say Morton's or Peter Luger. However for me Eddie V's was still a little over priced for the quality of food and service."}
{"text":"I was able to experience this restaurant during one of their Preview nights.  The restaurant is beautiful and is good for a romantic night out or large group.  Everything we ate was amazing and I highly recommended it!  Apps: Crabcake and Yellowtail sashimi - delicious!!! Entrees: We had the Parmesan Crusted Sole, the Halibut and NY Strip 16 oz medium rare cooked to perfection - All three were amazing and personally the Sole is probably the best-tasting fish dish I've had in all of Charlotte. Sides: Lobster Mashed potatoes & Asparagus - yummm!!! Dessert: Godiva chocolate molten cake, my husband almost melted in his chair and said this was the best chocolate cake he's ever tasted."}
{"text":"What a fantastic dining experience we had last night.  From the lobster taco appetizers, to the flaming bananas Foster butter cake for dessert, everything was top-notch.  For the main course we had sole fish and the citrus scallops. The ambiance was fantastic as was the band playing in the bar/lounge. They have a very extensive wine list that is sure to please even the most critical wine aficionados."}
{"text":"Met some colleagues here for dinner one evening.  Located in the Scottsdale Quarter, this high end restaurant is a great place for dinner.  If you're price sensitive, this is not the place for you....don't even bother.  Our reservation was for 6:45 pm and it was jam packed, good thing we called ahead.  We were promptly seated in the main dining room.  After browsing the extensive menu, I decided to order:  Baby Iceberg BLT Wedge - (Bacon, Maytag Blue Cheese, Buttermilk-Chive Dressing), $9 Twin Lobster Tails - Broiled, MKT Price Truffle Mac 'n Cheese, $6 (for small portion) Godiva Chocolate w/Vanilla Ice Cream  All of the food was excellent.  The Twin Lobster Tails were perfect and came with Butter to dip them in.  They were so good, I used very little Butter.  I enjoyed the broiled flavor on it's own.  The Truffle Mac 'n Cheese was very rich & creamy, amazing.  The BLT Wedge was very good too, but the portion was too large and I had to leave 1/2 of it because I didn't want to be full when my entree came out.  At the urging of my colleagues, I ordered the Godiva Chocolate w/Vanilla Ice Cream.  It was awesome, but very rich.  I had to split it with everyone because there was no way I could finish it after the big meal.  The hot Godiva Chocolate oozed out of the center of the Cake....and the Vanilla Ice Cream complimented it perfectly.  The service here was impeccable.  They have a great staff.  Can't wait for my next visit.  Return Factor - 100%"}
{"text":"We decided to choose Eddie V's for Restaurant Week and we were not disappointed! Located in Scottsdale Quarter, this restaurant is the best spot to take a date - it's romantic, classy, dim, and expensive! Our server, Wesley was great. He gave us great recommendations and was extremely attentive and friendly.   The hubby stared with an orange mojito, which was recommended by our server. We had a three course dinner for $44/person and you can include add ons for an additional charge.   For my first course, I had the salt and pepper shrimp. I loved the shrimp! It was exquisite and perfectly cooked. Hubby's first course was the lobster bisque - creamy, tasty, and big chunks of lobster. The second course - 8 oz filet mignon with Au Gratin potatoes (addl $5). Hubby ordered the popular Hong Kong Sea Bass (addl $10). Both were rich and full of flavor. The potatoes were so creamy and I thoroughly enjoyed them. Our last course (dessert), I ordered the wild berry sorbet and hubby ordered the bananas foster. The sorbet was ok but the bananas foster was divine so I recommend ordering that!  We had a great time and I highly recommend. Total of our bill: $125 not including tip"}
{"text":"If I could give this restaurant more than 5 stars I would. Happy Hour is wonderful of you are on a budget. They have live music and all the employees make you feel top priority. The lighting is dim so awesome to take a special person there. Love everything about it. Valet parking is there and wonderful. Great restaurant."}
{"text":"I eat steaks in every city I go. The service here was very good and the meal was excellent. I had the Filet and my girlfriend had the filet Oscar , both were cooked correctly and tasted fantastic.  if you have the time to relax listen to some nice jazz from the live band and spend a few bucks I suggest this place for a great evening out - Caesar salad was good , I prefer mine to be prepared table side but they don't offer that , Yet. The wedge salad was tasty too. For desert we had the creme brûlée ,I recommend you share one it's a decent size . For a more relaxed time have dinner in the lounge near the live jazz band - which I believe perform each night ."}
{"text":"Lovely atmosphere, excellent food, attentive staff.  It doesn't get better than Eddie v's.  Almost want to discount their success because of the \"chain\" thing but it impossible not to appreciate what this restaurant has to offer.  Hong Kong, miso and chili seasoned sea food was amazing!  Bollinger special cuvée is well priced on the extensive wine list and the cocktails looked fun too.  Reserve a seat in the dining room where you can still hear and enjoy the live jazz from the bar.  Look to spend $125 to $200 per person if you are drinking."}
{"text":"i was impressed. very impressed on my first visit to eddie v's. our reservation was quite early ... 5 pm (note: at 5: pm on a sunday in august, reservations are not necessary).   the setting was lovely. it kinda reminded me of a vegas casino, in that inside the restaurant you have absolutely no idea whether it is sunny outside or not. the place was dark; really dark, with no windows that one could look outside of. not a bad thing, but worth mentioning. it felt romantic, intimate and friendly. swanky, but comfortable.   our food was lovely. seared ahi was served in a hot-to-the-touch bowl, which i do not prefer. i would have preferred the accompanying noodles cold. everyone agreed their steaks were excellent, and my bacon wrapped scallops were to die for. the portion was quite small with only four medium size scallops, but they were rich, buttery and not at all rubbery. i was stoked. the truffle mac and cheese was good, but didn't compare to others i have eaten. twice baked potatoes were a hit as well. broccoli was served as two whole crowns, which i found curious. asparagus was crisp and flavorful. my creme brulee was the best i've ever tasted. seriously yummy stuff.   our server was a bit overly eager. helpful, knowledgeable, full of data we never really asked for but still useful. drinks and other requests were fulfilled quickly. his tips, like ordering dessert when meals were delivered was appreciated but a little less eager and he would have been my most favorite server ever. yes, i recognize i might be a bit critical of servers.  4 stars seems right for eddie v's. everything wasn't perfect, but it was great. i will definitely be back. i must try the $29.95 summer prix fixe menu and i need to check out the lounge scene. so far i really, really like what i've seen."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and my server Loren was   very attentive. She was even familiar of the characteristics of my favorite wine. Started with the ahi tuna tartare. It had a little spice but just enough. Entree was the special, a grilled sea bass. I chose this over the signature Hong Kong sea bass. I was not disappointed. I supposedly bad a date but she stood me up. Because of that Loren or her boss Richard Shumaker bought me dessert. Oh I did run into an old friend so I didn't dine alone. There was a jazz combo that was very good and then a jazz pianist took over a little later. The menu and wine list here are very similar to their sister restaurant Wildfish. I thinK they are both excellent seafood restaurants here in the AZ desert. I recommend my seafood froods try both of these restaurants."}
{"text":"Miss Eddie V's being at DC Ranch .. it was closer to home.  Anyway, the new digs at Scottsdale Quarter are worth the drive.  The food and atmosphere are still excellent!  Had some raw oysters, shrimp and the Point Judith Calamari to start.  The calamari was very tasty and I could have had to entire order myself as an entree.  Had the scallops which were heavenly!  My companions also seemed to enjoy all of their entrees as well. My husband and I love Mastro's for steaks.  He had the bone-in rib eye and said it was just as good, if not better than Mastro's.  Docking them a star because the server tried to push the extras, especially the seafood tower when we ordered appetizers.  Otherwise,we love this place."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful experience this past weekend with my husband.  We had called in on a Sunday night to make same-night reservations for our 1-year anniversary.  Being a Sunday, they were able to take us at our preferred time without any issues.  When we arrived, the hostess greeted us by name (they must have only had us as reservations at that time, because we had never been there before). We were taken to our table right away. Once we arrived, we were greeted with rose petals on the table and a Anniversary card signed by the staff.  It was very sweet of them to put in the extra effort to make our night that much better.  We ordered two drinks, I ordered something called the Red Dragon (or something similar in name) which I was told would be similar to a strawberry mojito, my husband ordered what I believe they called their 24 Karat Gold drink (or something similar) it had a gold sugar rim.  My husband loved his drink and later ordered a mule he said was excellent.  I did not care for my drink, nor did my husband (it tasted like nasty cough syrup in my opinion), so I kindly asked for it to be replaced with a glass of Cabernet; which they did with no hesitation.  We then had the seafood tower, shared a BLT wedge salad, a filet minion, lobster mashed potatoes, and brussel sprouts.  The seafood tower was excellent, the wedge salad was incredibly delicious, the filet minion was the best I've ever had in my life - cooked to PERFECTION, melted in your mouth, worth every single penny.  The lobster mashed potatoes were good, but I'm a huge mashed potatoes fan, and I'd just say they're good, not amazing, just good.  The brussel sprouts were cooked and flavored nicely, we even enjoyed them as left overs with the following nights dinner.  Lastly, we were given a complimentary dessert for our anniversary, so of course we ordered the flaming banana foster dessert, not something I would normally go for, but it was our anniversary so we wanted the extra flare.  It was very good, but again not a flavor I typically go for, the next time we go I'll likely try one of their other dessert.  That being said, we did lick the plate clean still.  They packed up our leftovers and sent us on our way.  It was a lovely night, the staff was all amazing, we loved our waitress and the busboy who continuously checked on our water and packed up our food.  Looking forward to going back again."}
{"text":"Went yesterday with a party of 8 (4 couples.)  The prices rival Maestro's, Fleming's, Dominic's or Ruth Chris' the service and attention to detail however, do not live up to the competition.  Because we had a party of 8 we did get a private room which was very nice, it did however leave us very separated from our waiter so when things did not go as expected we were stuck waiting.  Appetizers came and were very good, the shrimp was great!  Then came the first course, I order the Lobster Bisque as did others, my Bisque was delivered but no spoon.  Another party did not get the Apple Salad they ordered.  So we had to wait appox. 10 minutes for the waiter to come back for a spoon and the salad.  There was no \"so sorry\" just a I'll get that right now, and they did come quickly after that.  About half the party ordered steaks, two of the party, those who asked for their steaks to be more well done received steaks which were medium rare.  This would not have happened at the other top end competitors which seem to have a way to know their steaks are cooked to the way they were ordered.  Deserts were good.  With an $800 bill before the tip we expected a little more."}
{"text":"Eddie V's recently began offering 'All Night Happy Hour'.  This is a beautiful thing for someone like me who typically doesn't leave the office in time to get anywhere before most HHs end.  Hey, the desk-bound want happy discounted stuff too!!  I started the week off right on Monday by meeting a friend at the end of the day for HH.  Great decision!  The bar/lounge area is nicely appointed and even had live music from a jazz trio.  Over glasses of Pinot Noir we enjoyed items from both the HH and regular menus:  Wedge salad - a nice portion of cool lettuce, topped with decadent bleu cheese crumbles and heirloom tomatoes.  Our waiter even split it for us, just to keep things fair.  Crab cake - this is fantastic.  It is easily the circumference of a softball and bursting with crab.  Just crab - no chintzy filler to affect the flavor or texture.  Priced nicely for HH and delightful when paired with the remoulade sauce.  I save the best for last...  Truffled mac n cheese.  Let me say this one more time - Truffled Mac N Cheese.  Best. Thing. Ever.  This is really beyond description, but I will try.  A perfectly-executed combination of pasta, zesty cheeses, truffle oil and truffles too!  Don't forget the all-important 'crust' of cheese on top.  AAAAAAAGH!  Under my facade as a Responsible Grownup, there lies a 5-year-old who counts mac n cheese as one of my favorite things.  If this is the last one I ever taste, I will be happy.  OK, I will admit it.  We went back on Friday, too...   Primarily for the mac n cheese.  Really."}
{"text":"Had reservations for 8:45 they got me in at 8:00 very impressive on such a busy night! Sat at a booth in the lounge it was very nice with live music which was great too! Water was poured and there were things floating in it so ordered bottled water. Caesar salad was delicious! I ordered the center cut filet well done. The steak came well done on the outer edges and center was very pink I didn't even eat it. Drinks were good and waitress was amazing and very friendly!"}
{"text":"Eddie V's needs to get a grip.  They act like they are a high end New York or LA steak  house.  Not even close also the music in the bar is way too loud and not very good.  Really just a snow bird trap or pick up bar for lonesome Scottsdale types."}
{"text":"A very nice upscale restaurant.  Bar was crowded but didn't have a problem ordering a drink and music was a little Loud. But it was Friday night.  Food was amazing and so was the service."}
{"text":"Such a delicious dinner! We came and dined here on Friday night with some friends and were treated to excellent cuisine and excellent service, we will absolutely be back! We were too full for dessert but I heard that they are absolutely amazing and Not to be missed!"}
{"text":"Very impressed with service on the superbowl weekend. Appetizers and starters were a hit all around the table. We had the corn chowder, half dozen oysters, salad, Hawaii hamachi and the jumbo lump crab.   Mains were extremely disappointing. All dishes were overlooked- from the chicken to the halibut, the sea bass and the steaks!!   Also, I had the ' truffled steak and lobster tartare' for my main course. But it was horrible. The truffle was not fresh, not thinly shaven and the grated cheese did not go well. And the lobster was cooked!! How is that tartare??   We duly gave feedback to the manager who acknowledged the overcooked mains, but claimed that they are 'not Allowed to serve shellfish raw' and that one 'could get very sick eating raw lobster'. (She also claimed lobster could not be eaten raw and this is absolutely not true) Erm, aren't oysters considered shellfish? And didn't we just have a dozen of them raw? Did you just say that it's illegal?   Obviously totally ignorant and or totally lying."}
{"text":"This is a high end seafood restaurant located on the edge of a bustling shopping center in glamorous north Scottsdale.  Speedy valet parking is available for $3 which was well worth it given how busy the area was the Saturday night we visited. We were seated right away for our 7 pm reservation by their extremely professional and efficient staff.  Our server stopped by right away to welcome us and explain the all ala carte menu.    Prices here are not for the budget traveler with most of the fresh fish options in the $30 range and side dishes in the $6 range.  We started with the blue crab cake ($16) which had a delightful panko coating and zesty remoulade (our favorite dish of the meal) followed by a fresh heirloom tomato & buffalo mozzarella salad that we shared.  The kitchen was kind enough to split it for us and even then it was still two large portions.  We also split an entree, again kitchen divided it for us, a lemon sole that was also more than we could eat.  After our meal the restaurant manager stopped by the table to check if the food was ok since he had noticed back in the kitchen we had left a lot uneaten (we had had too much at lunch and were still stuffed), but still a very nice touch and mark of top notch service.  The place was a little on the noisy side and the crowd was dressy and stylish.  There was a live jazz trio playing somewhere adding to the ambiance.  All in all a pleasant evening to top off our visit to the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"I rarely give 5 stars to a restaurant, but if I could I would give it 6 stars. Everything about this place is amazing. The food and service was amazing. I recommend the crab cakes and salmon dishes. Extra special thanks to the manager for taking care of our additional needs."}
{"text":"This place is okay.  I enjoyed my meal, which was a surf and turf...filet mignon and lobster tail.  The steak was a bit over-cooked, but the lobster tail was awesome!  We ordered the seafood tower as an appetizer...which was good, but I have definetely had better seafood towers.  The selection on the tower was okay, but I wish they had more raw fish on there.  It had a lot of oysters, which pretty much went uneaten at our table.  The service was good and attentive, which was a plus for this palce.  Overall, I had a good experience here."}
{"text":"Amazing food, service, and atmosphere! Highly recommended for anyone looking for a great night out with high class cuisine."}
{"text":"Truly an exquisite meal. A very fancy establishment as you would imagine. Extensive wine list to choose from. Great seafood selection. I tried swordfish steak for the first time it was very good, topped with avocado crab and chili. The fried oyster appetizer was my favorite I could have devoured so many of those. And the bananas foster desert is quite the delicious experience. Great spot for a classy date night!"}
{"text":"This 4 is generous it's definitely an upscale restaurant. Prices are priced about the same as a Ruth Criss. A little disappointing that the butter served was freezer burned. The wine list is large and priced about 20% above wine apps prices. Salad was large cold seemed like it was premade lettuce was a little wilted. Entree Sea Bass over cooked but still tasty. Eddie V is a busy place and will need to up their game if they plan on staying on top of the restaurants in SCOTTSDALE."}
{"text":"I used to love this place. Now dark, depressing and the food is so over priced and has really gone down hill."}
{"text":"We took my mother here for the mother's day brunch and it was absolutely amazing food and wonderful service.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Went for a early Father's Day Thursday night and had a great time. David our server was very diligent and personable making the experience that much better. Yellow tail sashimi and halibut was Excellent as well as the assortment of oysters. Atmosphere was high end and perfect for a martini. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I made a reservation for Eddie V's a couple weeks ahead of time to celebrate my graduation from a masters program.  I'd read a lot of great reviews and was excited for the experience.  Unfortunately the restaurant disappointed on quite a few fronts.  Strike 1:  I called the night before to see if I could move my rezzy up 30 min and the hostess confirmed.  My group of 8 arrives at 7:30 but the hostess hadn't updated my reservation.  This resulted in my large group having to wait 40+ minutes in the lobby before we were actually seated, 15 minutes after my original 8pm reservation.  Our waitress and the manager on call made up for it by giving us some appetizers, and I must admit the truffle mac and cheese was great - probably the best dish we experienced that night! Calamari was pretty good too.  Strike 2:  The restaurant was very busy because of graduation festivities, but we were patient in waiting to order. We did not, however, expect that it would take more than an hour to actually be served dinner.    When our dinner came out, the two bacon wrapped filets that we ordered medium rare were completely cooked through - medium well at best! My mom ordered the Chilean sea bass and said it was very dry.   Strike 3: Our waitress was very understanding and worked with us when we sent back the steaks.  After another 40 minutes, our new steaks came out very rare.  Sometimes you just can't win.  The lackluster experience kind of took the air out of the room and tarnished what was otherwise a great weekend.  To be fair to our waitress, she did all she could to help us out but the mistakes that were made were out of her control.  Our bill was adjusted to reflect the weak experience we had, but honestly I feel like a restaurant of this caliber shouldn't have made the type of errors we experienced.  I can cook a perfect medium rare steak at home, and I just learned how to spell sous vide yesterday!"}
{"text":"We were very disappointed with the seafood options, especially shellfish.   Very dark inside. Take your money to the Ocean Club instead."}
{"text":"There are several good choices right in the area, Scottsdale Quarter and Kierland Commons and Eddie V's is among the best.  I dropped in on a busy Friday during the week of the PGA golf event so the place was rather hopping.  I was able to be seated at a high top in the bar and, a good place to be as the live music was a really talented piano player and supporting musicians.   That fella years ago used to play at another nearby club (which I've lambasted for their lame live talent anymore) so GOOD FOR EDDIE V's for finding him.  On to the food......  Oysters, very tasty and had a good handful of selections from both east and west coast.  I had the east coast and apologies I can't recall the name, smaller but very good with the well-made martini and bleu cheese stuffed olives.   For dinner I was between the swordfish and the parmesan encrusted sole, and I chose the latter which was terrific.  Not only well prepared but nice meaty pieces of sole.  The brussel sprouts were a good accompaniment.   The wine list is good and I chose Sonoma Cutrer chardonnay.   So if you want a seafood in the area, I choose Eddie V's.  For steak I most often end up at Dominick's.  Yum yum."}
{"text":"We had an amazing dinner, great ambiance excellent service combined with delicious food and the best drinks in town! Also, impecable service from start to finish - thank you Gem. Eddies V's welcome to Charlotte!"}
{"text":"The hostesses on St. Patrick's Day were rude little girls.  I would not return based on their attitudes seeing as how they were my first impression of the restaurant and how they treat people.  This was my first and last visit.  With so much competition in that area, there are plenty of other places to choose from where I am sure are more welcoming and less snotty."}
{"text":"Fantastic dinner experience tonight being served by Emily. She was very friendly, thoroughly explained their specialities and answered all of our questions. Her warm personality and smile made us feel very welcomed as it was our first time at Eddie V's. Not only did they have a birthday card on the table for us, but they also provided a complimentary champagne toast and a birthday dessert. This restaurant knows how to provide quality service and delicious food. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Wow. One the best ribeye's I have had in awhile. Good, attentive service by Lauren, but not to touchy feelly. Nice music. Overall positive visit and I would cheerfully come back for more."}
{"text":"Truly an exceptional experience. From the Kung Pao Calimari which was perfectly spiced to the Strip au Poivre everything was perfect can't wait to go back again when I'm in Scottsdale"}
{"text":"This is our go to place for special occasions.  My wife and I celebrated our wedding anniversary and like always came through.  Arrived early to enjoy some happy hour apps and drinks.  Started off with their shrimp cocktail, crabcake, and their west coast oysters.    We had dinner reservations so they escorted us to our table that had a signed anniverary card from the team and rose petals!!!  Beautiful touch.  For dinner we had the 8 oz filet and 2 (4oz) filets oscar style with broccolini instead of asparegus.  We shared the truffled mac & cheese along with lobster mashed potatoes.    To end the night we ordered the banana fosters served table side (comped) and 2 glasses of champagne.     You want superb service everytime with high quality food this is place to go in Scottsdale.  Thank you Eddie Vs for making our night special!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I don't give 5 stars... This place is awesome!  Table service is superb! The food is just top shelf. Looking for a WOW dining experience, this is the place. Old school perfection. We enjoyed three courses and a wonderful selection of wine and tequila. Joey suggested we begin with the crab cake and boy was he right! The shrimp cocktail was as expected, perfect. The Cesar was topped with large shreds of aged parmesan. My filet was prepared with the finest attention. We tossed a curve an ordered a twice baked at the time our entree was presented, before I was able to slice my first bite, the hastily requested side arrived. Again WOW. We were inclined to to partake in flaming bananas foster and Godiva lava cake. Who cares what the bill is... This place exceeds expectations."}
{"text":"Yelpers made me pick Eddies!  The top reviews are right on.   Service immaculate very well thought out attentive and professional.  I'm quite picky about fish (fishermen grew up in Florida) Eddies not only did not disappoint but was extraordinary.  How do they get fish this fresh in landlubber Pittsburgh?  Chilean Seabass was a top quality cut perfectly prepared Asian style. The cold seafood tower was generous and showcased a diverse spread of lobster crab oysters on the half shell and large shrimp all fresh. Clients really enjoyed it. One ordered dessert the raspberry tort was wonderful. Great location and don't miss the live jazz in the bar!"}
{"text":"The steaks are delish, of course. But I usually come here for the Hope Diamond cocktail which is out of this world and made from Pea Flower Tea and the Bananas Foster dessert that they serve literally on fire at the table. The live jazz makes this place stand out from the rest."}
{"text":"Definitely the best Bone-in Ribeye in town! After visiting with my colleagues, I decided to returned the very next evening just to share this experience with my fiancé. Our hostess Andrea as well as our server Dominique were very pleasant. I made sure to request Dominique upon my return because of her attentiveness in serving our table. In addition to the Bone-in Ribeye, we enjoyed sautéed spinach, lobster mashed potato's, and the bananas foster. Great taste, and greater presentation!"}
{"text":"This place is very sexy. The ambiance is remarkable.  The staff was excellent and the seabass was amazing. Cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"We went for their soft opening and it was fantastic! We had oysters, calamari, shrimp and the tar tar. For the main the parmesan sole is to die for. Finish it off with the butter cake. The decor and service was fantastic as well. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Location/Parking- Grant Street and 5th in the Union Trust Building. They have valet in the front on 5th Ave. from Tri-state/William Penn Parking for $8. I recommend self parking at Mellon Square or Forbes Garage.   Ambience/Restaurant- Very elegant and posh. Cool blue and candle lighting. Impressive wine selection and large liquor inventory. Great for a romantic evening or an intimate occasion. White table cloth and fine dining service. Live music every night at 6p. It's a little chilly so bring a jacket and warm clothes.  Dining Experience- Happy Hour starts at 5p with some cocktails and oysters (East and West Coast) then live music started at 6p. A warm transition into a great meal. Many seafood selections and a changing menu. Price point is high but it's worth it for the experience.  Service- They host seats you smiling and provides you details for the server and menu. Crumbs are taken off the table and your napkin is folded when you leave your seat with silverware exchanged for each course.   Overall- I loved it and it was a nice evening that I will remember. One of the finer dining establishments in the city."}
{"text":"Great food, superb service and a great place to meet an important business account."}
{"text":"Went here Sunday while we were shopping at the Scottsdale Quarter and wee pleasantly surprised on how good everything was.  We say in the bar area so we could enjoy there happy hour specials.  The gf and I both had martinis which were amazing (they have blue cheese stuffed olives!).  For appetizers we had the fresh oysters and the steak and lobster tartare which were both great.   For entree my GF had the lobster bisque soup which tasted great.  I had the scallops and twice baked potato.  I have to admit wasn't a huge fan of the scallops, felt like the citrus orange over powered the dish but that's probably just personal preference.  The twice baked potato was a very large portion and was satisfying.  Overall was very happy with the meal and would life to come back and try a different entree.  Service was great throughout the meal."}
{"text":"Excellent excellent. From the Apps the the Entree to the Desert.   Which was in the house which made it even better.   Great Meal and Service."}
{"text":"We recently relocated from Dallas, TX and loved the Eddie Vs there.  We were happy to find one here in Scottsdale and have found that the quality of food and service is at the same high level that we had found in Dallas.   The food is delicious, the service is great and friendly, and they have a good happy hour."}
{"text":"Soooo, saddest little story about Eddie V's. A coworker and I had gotten into habit of going to Eddie V's after work for cocktails and food(cocaine would have been cheaper) and I love it there. We had a pretty consistent order of oysters, tar tare and calamari. Well, we get oysters one night and the second set of them (we got 2 of 3 different kinds) turn out to be the best oysters I have ever had. Unfortunately, the waitress had never told us which were which and we had eaten them too fast to try and figure it out. Gosh. One of life's great mysteries!  Anyways, the appetizers are wonderful, truly! The prices are high but so is the quality. We do not live in a town where oysters should taste great but I order them anytime they are on a menu and I have to say Eddie V's is the best place to get fresh, unique oysters! The drinks are also wonderful, the staff is attentive and it has a really great classic but well-kempt upscale steakhouse vibe. There is nothing stale about this restaurant!"}
{"text":"It had been several years since I'd been in, but we came for restaurant week back in Sept.  It was also my husband's birthday.  The prix fix menu was amazing.  I had  and my husband had a steak.  I would have thought the portions would have been smaller since it was a set price, but they were their normal (large) sizes.  The dessert, bananas foster butter cake is enough for 2-3 people to share, but it was included in the set price.  Of course, neither of us ate it all, but it is TO DIE FOR!!!!!   Am thinking we may go back for my birthday next week!!!"}
{"text":"I would like to start by saying that this restaurant/lounge really deserves its 5-stars! Usually, our group of girl friends meet on Wednesdays nights for happy hour at Brio in Scottsdale Quarter. Today, we decided to switch it up a bit and went to Eddie's! Well, we were not disappointed at all. When you come in, it is pretty dark everywhere, the lounge is on your left (this is where the Happy Hour is) we asked for a table for 4 people and were sat right away. Tonight, there was a band playing, Jazz music I believe (very nice!). Kara, our waitress was very professional and nice. She made sure we had everything we needed, water, bread (their bread is delicious! I'm French, I know a bit about good bread..) wine, food. We even asked her if we could change tables (our table was right next to the band, a little too loud for us, you know, we love to talk!)  The prices on Happy Hour are really reasonable, we were very happy to hear that they started doing happy hour all night long everyday of the week (but Friday & Saturday) during the whole summer! That's a good news! I tried the Ahi Tuna Appetizer and it was one of the best Ahi Tuna I have ever eaten. They added curry and sesame oil in the tuna (such a nice touch!) there was also mango, grapefruit, avocado and orange in the plate. A very tasty appetizer!  We will definitely come back, it was a very nice first experience. We will recommend this place to our friends and family."}
{"text":"We liked the band great cocktails unfortunately I ordered crab cakes and almost chocked on a good size bone in them the waiter apologized  obviously the female manager never made it out to talk t us as promised it can happen but it was not handled so well"}
{"text":"I rarely bother to write a review unless the place is a 5 star (in my opinion), but I have to make an exception in the case of Eddie Vs, because of the prices. We went there to celebrate one of my \"milestone\" birthdays. The table was fine, the service was \"ok\", but you needed a flashlight to read the menu...literally. My wife had the lobster/crab bisque, but it had little flavor and the meat was rubbery. She didn't eat half of it, and told the waiter, who apologized, but I don't think the bill was adjusted. My oysters on the half shell were delicious. the wife had Chilean sea bass \"Hong Kong style\" and said it was delicious. I had a filet, which was not one of the best I've ever had, despite being listed as \"prime\" cut. We split an order of grilled asparagus and an order of lobster/crab fried rice. The rice was delicious and the hit of the evening. The asparagus was tasteless and hard. Hint to chefs everywhere...PEEL the asparagus to remove the tough skin! One small glass of wine was $15, and it was perhaps a six ounce pour, if that. The blackberry cobbler was tasteless, but the ice cream was OK. In short, for a meal that was over $170, including the tip, this was so not worth it. Mastro's was far better, IMO. Definitely not deserving of the 4.5 stars that it shows."}
{"text":"Outstanding food, drinks, and service. Crab cake appetizer was very moist and flaky. I had Chilean sea bass broiled, and my spouse had bacon wrapped filet oscar. Both we're delicious.  Alex was a gracious server."}
{"text":"I have dined here a handful of times and also during Pittsburgh Restaurant Week (summer 2017 and winter 2018). The thing I love most, in addition to the fantastic food, is the service is consistently impeccable. Even if you are there for the promotional meal and pricing of Restaurant Week they treat you like a priority with the expected service of an upscale seafood and steakhouse restaurant. I can't say the same for other places. We love Eddie V's and will continue to go back for regular dinners and celebrations!"}
{"text":"I literally cannot say enough about this meal!! Perfection top to bottom. The prices are definitely for the upscale diner, but worth every penny and more."}
{"text":"I've been to Eddie V's twice now recently... Both times my experiences have been less that stellar. I'm bummed about it because so many people I know have such amazing things to say about their experiences there. I don't know if I just went on a couple of off nights, but for their price point I was hoping for a stellar experience.   on both experiences, we encountered hostesses who weren't friendly and on the second visit got a very snotty comment when I told her my name for the reservation. It took for a good 15 minutes to seat us and explanation as to why we were all standing around.   Service the second time was horrible... We dined on a weeknight and our server was really trying to rush us to turn the table. It was obvious to all of us. We ordered some apps, I loved their Kung Pao Calamari and the chilled seafood tower was delicious as well.   The frustrating thing is that our entrees came out rather quickly after our apps - even though we specifically told our waiter that we were celebrating that evening and to hold our entrée order until we were nearly done with the apps. And to add fuel to the fire, a couple of our steaks were severely overcooked.  He dropped our check without even asking if we wanted dessert. Super frustrating experience."}
{"text":"The host staff was very warm and welcoming when walking in to a surprising dark lobby.  After waiting a few mintues we were sat for our reservation in the back corner by the windows.  Or server came by soon after and was all smiles but in an over the top confused look sort of way.  She offered sparking or flat when we ask for flat she brought out Fiji -- normally at nicer restaurants this is complimentary but we spent $24 on water which was a suprise given it was never mentioned.  The server was all too eager to keep pushing for the up sale and the add on it was very annoying.  We ordered one bottle of wine for the three at the table drinking and she insisted we get two bottles, etc.  We poured all of our own wine after the first pour, so I never did bother to order another one....  The food, I can only speak for the taste of my own food, but all 7 of us were fighting for the bathroom later that night (sorry probably too much information).  I started with the Caprese salad which was small and not refreshing.  I got one slice of tomato and one slice of Buffalo Mozzarella garnish with a handful of dry spring greens that sat in vinegar.  For dinner I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass \"Hong Kong\" style which was aromatic and had good flavors but the fish itself didn't seem as fresh as it could of been.  Maybe it was because it was steamed it didn't fall apart like what I was used to... I'm not sure.  This place was nothing special thats for sure, good wine list though and the bar area did look fun unfortunately we didn't both to stay and check that out."}
{"text":"This is a great place for food and a fun place to people watch. With a party of four, we got the seafood tower (oysters, enormous shrimp, lump crab meat, a lobster) for the table. So amazing. I loved everything (look it's a seafood tower, of course I loved it!). Then for dinner to try to order a somewhat responsible dinner, I ordered the steamed chilean sea bass in a soy-ponzo sauce over wilted spinach. I though, man this doesn't sound as good as the lemon Parmesan sole, but I'm being good. Holy cow, it was the BEST cooked fish I've ever had. EVER. I'm craving it now. The fish melted in my mouth and the sauce was so good, I asked for a spoon. Service was perfect.   As for people watching it's a little bit of a hot spot for a somewhat older crowd (50s?). I arrived about 10 minutes earlier than the rest of my party and I didn't even try the bar since there was a lot of men standing next to their seated dates. There was a live band, everyone seemed to be having a great time, a little whooping and hollering. A couple of *DRUNK* ladies exited while I was waiting by the door complaining about not getting any attention from the men here. So funny. Perhaps it's couples hot spot? None the less, its a fun joint.   Exited to go back and order that fish again!"}
{"text":"Class act. This Restaurant is so beautiful, classy, great live entertainment and the food is perfection. I have visited twice, the first time I sat at the bar and had the lobster tacos.. This is a must have. Worth the price tag about $20. The cocktails were all creative and  hand crafted. The second time I visited it was restaurant week. I had rock shrimp appetizer and for entree I had filet medallions and shrimp scampi. Filet cooked perfect, I ordered rare. Shrimp was big and flavorful. The dessert was outrageous banana fosters cake with ice cream. The service was great. Wonderful place for cocktails and entertainment or"}
{"text":"My family went here for my parent's wedding anniversary and we had an amazing experience, the food was SO good and the service was wonderful. We would absolutely recommend Eddie V's, and the best thing is their amazing military discount! My husband is a retired vet, and at the end of the meal we asked if they happened to have one, and the waitress was so accommodating and she got it done for us and it's 25%! What beats amazing food AND a local company that supports our VETS!?"}
{"text":"4.5 stars: 4 food | 5 service  Came to Eddie V's for my birthday, and was definitely impressed.  First accommodation I received was a birthday card, along with scattered birthday themed pieces on the table. It really brought a fun theme to the environment and I was excited for what was ahead.  The menu here is perfect. The organization is great, with appetizers, a subdivision between smaller dishes and larger, and dedicated sections for special dishes like oysters and combos. The variety is also well represented in all the dishes---you'll have plenty of fishes and flavors to try out. The drink menu is also absolutely stacked, and you'll find anything from cheap beers and champagnes to standard cocktails and even the most expensive of drinks that go into prices of the thousands.  In terms of the food, I ordered about as much as I could eat in a sitting.   Appetizers I went with colder dishes, oysters and yellowtail sashimi. The oysters were pretty good, but not stellar. I ordered an East coast variety, and they weren't too salty, which was nice, but they also didn't have much texture and wasn't all that savory. In terms of the sashimi, the dish took a very unique twist on traditional Japanese sashimi, which is usually not flavored. The sashimi was instead served with a heavy and salty sauce, and moderately garnished. At first, I thought it was an okay balance, but as I continued eating, the dish was just really salty and really drowned out the flavor of the fish. The dish was still really interesting and the ham-like texture of the yellowtail was interesting.  For the entrees, I ordered a sea bass and a lobster tail + steak combo. The lobster tail and steak were rather disappointing. First, I had a filet steak, and the steak was so loose, and tasted more like a New York strip (maybe even looser); there was no tender texture that filets normally have. Then, the lobster tail was a South African cold water variety, which had me really excited. These lobsters are special because they have larger tails than Maine ones, and also don't have large claws, which apparently make their tail meat super special. However, when I ate my lobster, I found it to be really tough. This might have just been because it's a different variety of lobster, but the meat was just really tough and didn't have the bounce and juicy texture that Maine lobster has. The flavor however, was pretty bold, and I really enjoyed the butter smell.   As for the sea bass, it was an absolutely sublime experience. Even though the bass filet is steamed, it comes out perfectly tender, so much that the individual layers of meat can still be separated apart. The flavor is light, but the sauce at the bottom of the dish helps adds another dimension to amazing meat. The garnishes that come with the dish is also amazing, and I just loved everything about it.   I also ordered a lobster mac as a side, but it wasn't too memorable. Really standard cheese and the lobster flavor didn't really find a spot amidst all the gooey flavor. For desserts, I had the chocolate cake and it was pretty much as much as I'd expect out of a hot chocolate cake. Not too sweet, nothing too bold, and presentation is really normal --- just a round cake in the middle of a plate. I did get happy birthday written on the edges of the plate, which was pretty nice.  For the service, it was just amazing. I was seated slightly late, and they gave me complimentary appetizers. I had a free birthday dessert, and my waiter just explained everything to be so nicely, whether it was something from the salads, to how a wine is crafted, or even how to eat a dish.   I really enjoyed my time at Eddie V's, and although not all the dishes hit the mark, the service is impeccable, the selection of items is amazing, and everything in the restaurant gives you an opportunity to have a fun time."}
{"text":"If you are a Seafood Lover Eddie Vs is where its at. We were turned onto this place by a friend on a business trip at the Tampa FL location. Everything we ordered on the menu at both locations Scottsdale and Tampa was TOP NOTCH I highly recommend ordering the Seafood tower its absolutely INCREDIBLE !! Its obviously top shelf seafood which your going to pay for but its totally worth it in my opinion."}
{"text":"food was outstanding, attractive and service was timely.  will go back"}
{"text":"Previous two visits to restaurant were good overall but last visit on 2/17 was disappointing. First off , we had a 6:45 reservation and upon arriving, I noticed several empty tables. Unfortunately, we were seated near the drafty open front door and in a direct path to the kitchen. Our waiter I felt had a bit of an attitude which didn't help matters. He greeted us very quickly when we were seated with a wine list and then vanished. After waiting about 12 -15 minutes, I stopped him as he was walking by to place an order We ordered two side dishes and upon arrival, he immediately took it upon himself to serve both of us without bothering to ask if we each wanted both sides. A lack of common sense.  My Snapper was in an interesting sauce but it was so over powering that it was difficult to taste the fish .   Overall, we felt the food was okay but overpriced. The service was fair."}
{"text":"My hubby and I celebrated our 30th wedding anniversary with a delicious dinner. Our reservation was for 7:30; we showed up little early and they were able to seat us immediately. The staff was VERY attentive. While our waiter was taking another party's order, another member of the wait team came over to get things rolling by taking our drink order and going over specials. When our waiter came to us, he asked if we were celebrating anything. When we told him it was for our anniversary, he stopped all conversation, disappeared for a minute, then came back with rose petals and sprinkled them across the table. From appetizers to dessert, the food was perfectly prepared and absolutely delicious.  If we should return to AZ for whatever reason, we'd definately eat there again."}
{"text":"My father in law took us to this wonderful place when we were visiting him and it made such a great impression on us that we decided to have our rehersal diner here! (We had destination wedding.) The food is fantastic and the ambiance is classy but not stuffy. We felt very comfortable and taken care of here. When organizing our rehersal dinner, the communication to and from the restaurant was prompt and detailed. They printed special menu for us with our names on the top - it was a nice touch and great addition to our wedding scrapbook. We are looking forward coming here again whenever we are back in Arizona."}
{"text":"double-x blacklist. overrun with insects. fruit flies floating in drinks, buzzing flies in my face and landing on my food. reputation squandered. one star.  and i don't mean the straggler here-or-there fly which is unfortunate, but normal. i'm talking about GODDAM-pile-of-rotting-food-nearby attracting and breeding ground for all of them. little green ones with long wings, little black ones, and flies, flies, flies. SHAME on you. They're all over us and i'm no snoopy's pigpen!  same lies told by the same manager as last year. when I brought the insect problem to his attention he says, \"i just had it done last week.\" last year when i told him about the sorry state of the piano's tuning, he says, \"i just had it done last week.' GODDAMIT. BULLSHIT. *I* am a pianist, and I can tell when a piano hasn't been tuned in 6 months or more. LIAR!  ## host fiddled with his screen for *2 minutes* before he could take us back to our table. Really? ## server not listening. he had to make my drink 3 times over. OK the 3rd time, there were bugs floating in the glass.  ## heirloom tomatoes not ripe, cut too thick. seriously. i don't want to eat a raw potato either! ## sole stinks, not fresh.  i can't believe that in just one year, this place went from my highest recommendation for steaks and swank to double-x blacklist. what a shame!"}
{"text":"took my dad here for his bday.  everything here was excellent.  the food is amazing and with big portions.  the sea bass was large and delicious.  the lobster bisque soup was awesome.  our server was attentive and nice.  he gave us free dessert and coffee."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a classy spot to grab a cocktail and listen to some live jazz whilst people watching, then this is the place.   Ask for Jillian when you're at the bar. She makes a simple, yet fabulous summery and fresh gin cocktail that's not on the menu.   If you're lucky, you'll be there on a night when my favorite pianist, Nicole Pesce, is playing with the Renee Grant Patrick quartet. Sit back and soak it up."}
{"text":"I confess that we are not (quite) Eddie's audience--the price was a reach for me and my husband, but we were celebrating a special occasion, and I decided champagne at $20 a glass was worth it this once. The space is beautiful, the staff were all super helpful, and the live music for a full house on a Tuesday evening was a nice touch. This is the place to go to celebrate an engagement, a promotion, or a nice fat tax refund. Try the champagne sauce with their oysters on the half shell. The swordfish had a beautiful presentation. The vegetable sides are large enough for 2-4 people, and even the side salads can be shared by 2 people. We were full after eating our meal but plan on coming back one night just to feel special and try dessert."}
{"text":"So - back to Eddie V's on a \"leisurely\" Wednesday night.... only to have the most AMAZING experience yet!    In the V lounge, where the live music is at, the vibe and energy was off the charts.  They had a trio - Al Ortiz - and he was phenomenal.  I found out he plays with Stevie Nicks for 20 years or so.  That's some impressive talent and it was so much fun.    I tell you, there just isn't anyplace like Eddie Vs for the entertainment and cuisine.  Not exactly a 'hidden gem' - but I was shocked the lounge wasn't packed to capacity with such talent on stage.  All the better for me until the word gets out, I suppose."}
{"text":"Fantastic evening in the Lounge listening to old school Frank Sinatra live combo. Place is a sexy Supper Club with relaxing environment, classic cocktails, great food and nice wine. You should dress to impress and mix with upscale crowd. Great Birthday celebration. We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"such a lovely meal!  Sword fish was grilled with avocado and citrus, was just a bit grilled/charred on the outside, and cooked about medium-well but I really liked it anyway.  It came with no sides so i got the crab fried rice.  The fried rice had scrambled egg, mushroom and and crab in it and was maybe a bit overcome but again still liked it a lot.  Would rate the experience a solid 4+. If we ever go back to Pittsburgh I would bring my spouse here. service was very good and it was a lovely meal and experience, ambiance was really high end but I just ate in the lounge as I was all alone... Place was pretty dark and a lot of people were dressed in Pittsburgh Penguins jerseys so I'm guessing they have a game tonight..."}
{"text":"Yes!  My steak was perfect and delicious..... Mmm... Steak.  I had the 8 ounce filet mignon with broccoli.   I also had the heirloom tomato salad as an appetizer - the small tomatoes, cheese, and drizzle was great, but the larger tomatoes did not have much flavor and didn't seem fully ripened. I posted a picture; beautiful looking salad.    Service was great and the music was a perfect touch.  I would love to come back some time to try their happy hour!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for an amazing place to eat, come to Eddie V's.  I came here tonight with my family for my birthday and completely over indulged! Our server, Suzette, was super friendly and attentive.  She really brought our dining experience over the top.    The night started off with their calamari which was so flavorful and different than just your ordinary calamari!  For the main course, we enjoyed the bone-in rib eye, filet mignon, lobster, and seabass.  Our favorite side dish was the truffled macaroni and cheese!  To end the meal, we had a chocolate lava dessert - cooked to order.  Make sure you save room for that... it was fantastic!  My parents were impressed with the ambience, the live music, and the amazing bathrooms!  I will definitely be back soon... Be sure to make reservations.  We were lucky enough to find seating in the lounge area, but a reserved table/booth would have been nicer."}
{"text":"This is my second time to an Eddie V's.  First one was in Austin and had a very good experience.  Same to be said of this one, the seafood tower is delicious and almost too much for our group of 8 along with the other appetizers that we got we really didn't even need dinner!  However, my swordfish was better than fantastic, had a nice kick too it...was right on the edge of being too spicy but it was perfect.  Our waiter was very friendly almost too much as he told us he was going to a Bon Jovi concert with his wife...who is wearing leather pants that she still can fit into from High School...which was probably over 20-25 years ago.  I probably wouldn't go unless work or I am being taken there because it isn't cheap...but if you are going to go higher end, I like it better than Ruth Chris and other higher end steak houses."}
{"text":"We travel often and stop at an Eddie V's in any city we visit and always enjoy ourselves, so when we were headed back from the Grand Canyon to our hotel and were driving by this Eddie V's we just had to stop.  We sat at the bar for dinner and drinks.  The two ladies working the bar were decent, but not overly friendly.  They seemed abrupt and rushed.  They were somewhat attentive, but we felt rushed.  The food was outstanding, as always.  It was just the service we couldn't get past.... guess we're used to better from this restaurant chain."}
{"text":"Great experience. Made a reservation for two on short notice. Wine selection was fantastic. Attentive and great service. Sashimi appetizer, warm goat cheeae salad and sea bass - every bite was exceptional. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I went here on a Wednesday night in January for dinner as part of an event venue selection committee. The food and service were WONDERFUL. Because we were a larger group, we sat in a back booth, and it was private and cosy -- very nice, even when dining with my boss and our event planning vendors. Downside..and I hate to have to even publish one but...the lighting was quite low, to the point that our waiter carried a flashlight to help people be able to see the menu better. I loved the live jazz, and the drinks were great too. Just a really pleasant dining experience, and I would definnitely go back."}
{"text":"My husband's company asked us to make recommendations for his Company Holiday party - did a lot of research online and in Yelp and this was on the top of my list. So glad that this ended out being the place we went. It. Was. Fantabulous! We had 17 people, they assigned us 3 Waiters. It was a fabulous experience from start to finish.  Appetizers shared by all were crab cakes and bruschetta - both very well done, loved the sauce on the crab cakes. We had 3 dinner options - chicken, fish, and filet. I know that hubs and I should have ordered something different, but I was really excited to try the filet (had heard so much about it). The chicken and fish dishes had beautiful presentation. The filet was legen (wait for it) dary - legendary! It cut like butter and was cooked to perfection  (our diners had it cooked everywhere between rare and medium), mine was medium rare and simply perfect.  Sides shared by all were Twice Baked Potatoes, Truffle Mac and Cheese, and Asparagus with Hollandaise on the side - all were yummy, my fave was the twice baked (they had bacon, too!)  Shared desserts were Godiva Chocolate something, Bananas Foster, and Fresh fruit or something  (sorry  - didn't make it that far). The chocolate Godiva whatever was 'meh, not worth the calorie intake in my opinion. The Bananas Foster was incredible - and the flame during service was a fun touch!  I. Will. Be. Back. I will probably crave that filet in the very near future!"}
{"text":"In the area around Kierland and the Scottsdale Quarter, Eddie V's shines as one of my  favorite places. I love coming here after work to relax at the bar, chat with the bar team or listen to the music they have 7 nights a week.  After just a few trips here, the bar team, Steve and Justin in particular,  say's hello by name and has my drink ready for me almost immediately.  I make sure I let then know if I am going to try something different before they make my  normal.    I have only had the pleasure of a few of the items but I have enjoyed all of them. The lobster taco's are awesome and presented well.  The Filet was exactly as I like  it and  the desserts I have had, the Banana's Foster and the Blackberry cobbler, were outstanding.     One nice feature is their special occasion service.  They really go out of their way to make sure it is a memorable experience.  For my parents anniversary, they had rose petals in the shape of a heart, an amazing dessert and stellar service and attention from the management team.  Hats off to Richard and his amazing team of Suzette and Joe as well as my parents server, Mike T.   I highly recommend this place and hope you take the time to visit and experience it yourself."}
{"text":"what a great experience from michael at reception getting us in to the attentive service quick bar service on a busy night and delicious food! live music in the lounge and the crab fried rice wow! my husband and son shared the tomahawk steak .... we've had slot of good steak and my husband said it was the best seasoned and prepared he's had now that's a compliment  would definitely return!!"}
{"text":"Get the calamari, it's got a fiery Asian flavor that's unique and flavorful! So much better than your typical calamari with marinara sauce. Yuck! All the fish was great. I have been here twice. Once for a work buyout and once on a date night. Giving it four stars because of the service on date night. We were given our appetizer and the server didn't come back for 15-20 minutes to take our order. She was missing the whole night and when we had been finished eating for a while we waived her down and she asked us to hold on while she talked to her friend. Expected better service at a place like this!"}
{"text":"Delicious oysters and Lobster. Recommending for any occasions. High quality food, great service:) been there for few times and all of them was perfect"}
{"text":"Had a very great dining experience here on Saturday night with a friend. Our waiter was overly friendly and informational.   As far as the resturant - I don't want to sound like my dad, but the live music was a little loud.  Additionally it seemed like everyone in Scottsdale was celebrating a birthday on Saturday night.  With regards to the food - order the crab cakes - I thought Maryland had great crab cakes until I ate at Eddie V's - simply amazing.  Although not on the online menu I would highly recommend the Swordfish served with diced tomatoes, onions and avacado in a vinegar sauce.    Overall a great dining experience. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Ok, get rid of the mafia white outdated waiter jackets!!  I remember waiters in Brooklyn ny wearing these back in 1970! Dean Martin in not in the room anymore.  Now to the food.. Overpriced, yet tasty. Did not have the best waiter and they kind of ignored us.  Not worth $50 for my dish!! Had many steaks in NYC high end restaurants cost less and tasted way better. Eddie V's could not come close to any of them"}
{"text":"I received a gift card for Eddie V's on my birthday and was so excited as I have never had the chance to eat here before. We came on a Friday night and the service from start to finish was excellent! I ordered the Jumbo Gulf Shrimp and my friend ordered the Salmon. Both dishes were out of this world! We also shared an order of Broccolini which had the perfect combination of lemon and garlic. For dessert, we shared the Hot Chocolate Godiva Cake. It was superb (and that's coming from somebody who doesn't have a huge sweet tooth)! Eddie V's is a great place for a special occasion or date night!"}
{"text":"My personal favorite restaurant in the Phoenix area. There is no better place, Period! I've eaten at most nice steak and seafood locations across the valley and Eddie V's consistently stays atop my list of fine dinning."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if Eddie V.'s is owned by a man destined for his adult life to live in the shadow of the eponymous musician or a marketer unafraid of lawsuits seeking to capitulate on the automatic association with the aforementioned, but I am sure it's a steak and seafood house hoping to use Asian influences as the secret weapon against Morton's, Capital Grille and several other nearby clones/competitors. (I'm surprised this didn't disqualify it from parental selection, but I realize that the undertones are largely dismissable if one does not latch onto them in the hope of eating something with a flavor that isn't salt.)  Ornate but still permitting casual as few feel like dapper gentlemen and ladies on top of the world in 110+ degree heat, the decor is typical for its class and affable, straightforward service meets the expectations set by the price tag. I'd like to be writing a review of the more adventurous-sounding options here, but while I would feel more comfortable with \"Hong Kong style\" steamed fish not being \"mildly inspired by a Western interpretation of Hong Kong\" in a Chinatown, the presence of sushi conclusively made me averse to it. The following made the C. family cut:  - Jumbo Gulf Shrimp ($14): Nothing colossal or unusual about the cocktail.  - Hawaiian Yellowtail Sashimi ($15): A texture and flavor hit but tiny for the price. - Pacific Ahi Tuna ($29): A strong, soft high note, as was the accompanying fruit, vegetable and nut salad. - 12oz Filet ($40): Appropriately tender but disappointingly over-salted in the kitchen. - Sauteed Spinach ($5): Would've been better without the shameful pool of oil. - P-R Fries ($5): A massive, cheesy half-order that only truffle could have improved. - Blackberry Cobbler: Overpoweringly sweet. (Asian moderation was needed here.) - Molten Godiva Cake: Barely one stop short of chocolate overload but still too sweet.  For the contending class defined by its price range, Eddie V.'s offerings are a set of great ideas which unfortunately fall short in the execution even if it feels like not for a lack of trying. This restaurant relocated relatively recently and I'm unclear if they lost the magic or are experimenting trying to obtain some but for now I'd approach it with somewhere between cautious optimism and proactively limited expectations. That said, if it weathers the storm of increasing density of the formula in a few block radius, I'd try it again."}
{"text":"Went for their all night happy hour last Monday in the lounge, and was blown away! A live jazz band was playing, and the service was out of this world. Kara N was our server and she was on point with her menu knowledge, super friendly and engaging, and one of the most attentive people I have ever come across! As far as food goes, we went all out with a mix of oysters, lump crab cake, pot stickers, ahi sashimi, and scallops, finishing off with the panna cotta. The oysters are fresh, the crab cake isn't too fried and the sauce that comes with goes with everything, the pot stickers are delicious but the sauce is salty so beware, and the ahi is delicious with a mix of avocado and mangoes. Scallops didn't melt in my mouth but were quite delicious nonetheless. The panna cotta is nontraditional with more of a custard texture, but wow it's superb and comes with drool worthy biscotti and cookies. Thanks Kara for making our special night even better, we will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is top notch.  The decor alone is worth coming for.  This place looks like they just hosted the royal wedding.  Four of us can for a birthday at 7:30 on a Sunday, and the place was maybe 30% full.   The crab cake was fantastic.  The Caesar flavor was really good, and the presentation was fantastic.  I had the halibut, which was cooked perfectly, and tasted good, but I didn't think the sauce was up to par.  A little watery and chili didn't seemed to have been cooked long enough.  The hardest part to write about this review is the service.  Either our waitress was having a rough evening, or she just doesn't have a lot of personality.  She made a couple errors that weren't a big deal, but because of the dullness they seemed to be more annoying.  At this price and level of restaurant, the service is usually a lot higher of a level.    I'd definitely come back again."}
{"text":"My wife and I checked this place out while on vacation and, simply put, had one of the most consistently delicious meals ever. There wasn't a bad note. The stir-fry calamari appetizer, bone-in rib eye, and chilean sea bass were all delicious. So excited to hear that there is also one in my home of Orlando.  You cannot go wrong for an upscale romantic restaurant. It is mouth-watering good."}
{"text":"Went to Eddie Vs with a group on Monday.  Overall great experience.    The host service seemed to still be working out the kinks and made us wait a bit, but the tableside service was good.  Our waiter was funny, informative and thoughtful.  He noticed I loved the bread and gave me two loaves :)  We had drinks to start - ok prices on those.  I ordered the lobster bisque.  Was a little light on lobster, but it was very good for $11.    For dinner, everyone in the group has different things and all we're delicious.  We got the halibut which was good. Scallops were extremely refreshing.  Shrimp stuffed with crab were awesome.  Tofu dish was surprisingly good.  Sirloin was cooked perfectly at medium rare and the sauce was perfect.  For sides, we got the truffle Mac which was very good, broccolini which was awesome.  Au gratin potatoes were a bit much for me, more cream and cheese than potato.  Brussels sprouts were average, oily and I've definitely had way better.  For dessert we got the Godiva chocolate cake and the bananas foster butter cake.  I enjoyed the chocolate cake much more than the bananas foster cake.  It was way too rich for me!  We had a great meal and actually liked the food here better than capital grille.  Lighter and they cook the steaks better.  Docking a star because I still cannot get on board with the prices of places like this.  It's good, but pretty sure those $52 dollar steaks could be $35-$40..."}
{"text":"This place did nothing for me. Tasteless shrimp, almost completely tasteless \"Chilean sea bass\" (I'm still not convinced it was Chilean sea bass), undercooked asparagus, lame French fries (no doubt right from the freezer into the fryer) and bitter tasting lobster bisque. Our waiter was nice enough, but forgetful.  Dinner was $150 for two of us. I'd rather have spent $20 at the Hot Dog Stop just up the road, and lit the rest of the money on fire. And if you are going to pull off the charade of being an upscale Scottsdale restaurant, you probably should not let people in, who dress like homeless bikers.....Seriously.  I'll never go back. Very poor dolar-to-deliciousness ratio."}
{"text":"We ordered the following: -Crab fried Rice - seemed directionless as a dish and like they threw crab meat on top of it. Wasn't a complete dish and lacked thought. Also seemed to be sitting in some sort of broth. Highly caloric for no reason. -Truffle Mac - best part of my dining experience but not because it was amazingly cooked. Just the most tolerable thing I ordered. Rue was too soupy. -TarTar - this was the worst thing I ate, hands down. The way the steak in particular was seasoned and prepared rendered it inedible and nausea inducing. Truffle was thrown on top but not expertly incorporated into the dish and the oil was overused. Lobster I only finished because the meat was such a good quality but it reminded me of a church picnic seafood salad. Too much mayo was used. And the crostini was so damn hard I could crack a tooth on it. Waiter was kind enough to take it off the menu -Calamari - my co-worker ordered and I ate most of it. Only thing that I didn't regret getting. Presentation was too much though. A lot of fluff on the plate of saturated garnishes. Wish they would have let the calamari be. It was ruined by whatever sauce they put on the plate though. Made the batter soggy and fall off the calamari. -Creme brulee - came out cold. didn't eat but my coworker was put off by it. -Complimentary bread and butter - bread was trash, butter was amazing For the price point of this restaurant, I expected a better fine dining experience. I won't go to another one, in any city. Pittsburgh ruined it all for me."}
{"text":"1st visit tonight with husband: hostesses made you feel welcome, bartender (Mallory) was pleasant and made great drinks.  Once seated for dinner we had attentive and pleasant service from Christine.  The entertainment was a welcome treat and the restaurant decor and ambiance is elegant yet relaxed.  Our food was delicious, if you order the crab legs make it an appetizer as it is just that but good.  My husband had an issue with his entree but it was handled quickly with no issues.  The manager (Brynn) was very customer focused and made you feel appreciated for your visit.  We look forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Dinner tonight with wife, son and daughter. Great experience.  Food very well prepared and presented. Our waiter, Thomas, a top notch professional, an exceptional person. A highly recommended restaurant. One of the best in Pittsburgh,"}
{"text":"Our table wasn't ready by our reservation time, but the manager made up for it with complimentary cocktails and our server extended the happy hour specials. Great atmosphere, live music was nice, my date's sea bass was cooked perfectly and so was my steak. My date enjoyed the oysters. For a bit of elegance, atmosphere and great food, go to Eddie V's."}
{"text":"Service was great.  However, Lobster Bisque was tasteless and crab fried rice was extremely salty.   The Seabass and Snapper were both very good."}
{"text":"Fantastic, delicious, and beautiful restaurant! Went to the one in La Jolla, no comparison, this one is outstanding. We were 8 people and between the many shared appetizers to the main dishes, everything was phenomenal!"}
{"text":"A great place.  Great food, Service  was a  little  on the slow side, but maybe that was just that particular day.  Other wise it's  a nice place."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic experience here recently on Thanksgiving weekend 2017.  Only downside was we booked through Open Table and waited a solid 25 minutes past reservation time for our table.  Anyway, the wait was worth it because the meal and service were excellent.  Our server ended up bringing us complimentary champagne as well as desert for the special occasion we were celebrating and was frequently checking on us in between every other phase of the experience.  One of the specials this evening was a one pound (huge) South African lobster tail.  I wanted that, my wife wanted filet, both were more than either of us could eat, we each wanted surf & turf, so the server suggested we get one of each and he'd split them table side even though they're prepared as individual entrees.  That's what he did and the result was perfect; half a filet and a huge 1/2 pound of lobster, and of course lots left over for the next day.  The Patron perfect margarita was excellent; great taste, plenty of booze to meet the price point, so I was happy."}
{"text":"We had a fabulous group date night experience here last night. High class food (Calamari, George Banks Scallops, and the Banana Foster dessert were among the favorites of the night). Kudos to the wait staff for their knowledge of the menu and their attentive service. We so enjoyed the outstanding live jazz music and atmosphere, as well as the personal introduction to Chef Flavio.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Trying to find great fresh fish in Scottsdale is like trying to find a snowball in Scottsdale in August, and Eddie V's didn't disappointment my expectations nor my dates. It was just okay, not anywhere near a great piece of fish. The drinks were fine and the bar scene lively; hence why a 3 star and not a 2.   I give up trying to find great sea food in Scottsdale...only Gianfranco's fish is the best!"}
{"text":"We had a mostly fine experience here. I'm mostly vegetarian and obviously I expected the options to be limited-- they were. I do eat fish, but struggle to find things that don't have bacon and thick pours of hollandaise. It's mostly personal preference.   We came for the brunch menu and it was mostly good. Everyone liked their food and the cinnamon rolls were delicious for sure.  They were incredibly kind to split our kiddo meal into two for our very picky (and minimal) eater 4yo and 6yo.   It's a Darden restaurant, but one of the highest in the chain, though I'd be lying if I didn't wish I were at Olive Garden at times.   Quiet, dark and not super kid-friendly... great for date nights."}
{"text":"We decided to celebrate our one year anniversary here at Eddie V's. Everything was exceptional!   One flaw we noticed was the hostesses sat two walk ins before our reservation we had made weeks prior to our visit.   Arriving to the table we were pleasantly surprised with rose petals, and a signed card from the employees for our special occasion. This brought us great happiness and felt welcomed.   Every bite and every sip was superb. The server was phenomenal except she didn't write our food order down so we had the wrong side with our steak, nonetheless she put in our right order and it came out promptly, of course it was okay with us having extra food, just wish it was correct.   We chose our dessert and it was on the house, extremely happy we left the building.   Will always be one of my favorite places for very nice, delicious meal.   Will certainly return.  5/5."}
{"text":"Eddie V's, always consistent, great atmosphere, great food and service. This past Saturday, Labor Day weekend we had 6:00 reservations. Darko our server was amazing, extremely informative and very attentive, on top of his game.  We ordered cocktails while looking over the menu.  For appetizers, we chose the Steak & Lobster Tartar (truffled steak tartare and chilled fresh Maine lobster with toasted baguettes) and the Batterfried Oysters (light curry, cilantro, with pickled Asian cucumbers). Entrees were  Jumbo Lump Crab Cake (sauteed Maryland style with spicy chive remoulade),  Chilean Sea Bass (steamed Hong Kong style with light soy broth), Georges Bank Scallops (sauteed with citrus fruit, roasted almonds and brown butter) and 16 oz USDA Prime New York Strip Au Poivre  (cracked black peppercorn cognac sauce).  All the food was excellent, prepared to request and cooked perfectly. Our only complaint this visit was the extended time period we had to wait between our appetizers and entrees. I had over heard a server whose patrons complained about the wait, and they were told it was a busy time for the kitchen when the restaurant was so full. Seems to me then that the kitchen staff should of staffed up better for the Labor Day Holiday Weekend."}
{"text":"Everything was very good.  The ambiance, the service and especially the food.  The crab cake appetizer was delicious!  So was the filet mignon, the lobster and the chocolate Godiva lava cake.  Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I have to say I enjoyed this restaurant.  The salads fresh, scallops & steak cooked to perfection. Our server/service was very personable. Chatting it up with us while we waited for our plates. We went on a Tuesday evening, Bluesy live music was playing. STRONG tinis - whatever flavor you please."}
{"text":"What a letdown.   Service just weird and subpar. Pretentious without the follow-thru. Disappearing for long times leaving drinks unfilled, dirty plates on the table.   Server doing karaoke as she approached table. Not knowledgeable about menu or specials and communicated poorly. While live music was on she tried to stand at end of long table to take orders instead of moving around. Friendly but aloof.  Now the food is also over-rated in general. The bone-in ribeye was absolutely flavorless. Literally no flavor. That's very hard to do! Very overpriced at $49.  The veggie platter is a disaster at any price let alone $21. No seasoning. Poorly cooked. Mushrooms inedible. Asparagus same. No seasoning or flavor. Small portions.  Potstickers are the same as you'd get at Panda Express.  Heirloom Tomato-mozzarella salad extremely bad in all aspects. Mozz is chewy/grainy and entire dish is undersized for $14. Tomatoes were flavorless.  The crab fried rice was great.  Bathrooms have no doors just curtains. Immediately outside the un-doored bathroom is their silverware and napkin stash. Very odd.  Menu over promises and under-delivers.    Way over-priced for flavor and service."}
{"text":"Was there earlier tonight with a group for happy hour.  Not once did the waitress acknowledge my presence, even when I tried to flag her down.  I had to go to the bar to order a drink (did get great service there).  Was starving, but never got to order any food.  I was there for TWO hours.  Don't think we'll be back."}
{"text":"Really disappointing meal here last Saturday.  The service was off, very slow, very long wait for food.  The oysters were not good.  Very limp and not chilled enough. The salmon was good quality but a dull preparation.  Sea Bass, also good quality but not worth the money and too salty.  We usually love the place but not so much this time."}
{"text":"Oh Eddie V... What an experience. I really enjoyed my experience here.  The food was delicious. Service was great. Drinks were well made and the dessert was a great finale to the meal.  Eddie V will be in the rotation from now on. Maybe not all the time but sometimes :) I still need money to live on!"}
{"text":"My husband and I celebrated a early Valentine's dinner last night. I wanted to let Richard the Manager and Tim our server our appreciation for a wonderful evening and took care of us beyond excellent service to ensure a special dinning experience. We love the food at Eddie V's and loved the band playing last night thank you again. We will definitely come back again.. Thank you again."}
{"text":"Great experience! I came with a party of 6 for restaurant week. It was packed! We arrived early so we headed to the bar for drinks. The bartender served us right away. The host let us know they were running behind but we only waited about 10 more minutes for our table. The staff was on top of it! The live music at the bar was awesome however it was a bit loud when we were seated at our table trying to talk to one another. Food was absolutely delicious. The restaurant week menu had a variety of choices for a good price. We also got 3 family style side dishes to split for the 6 of us and it was a perfect amount. We did wait a while for our meals but like I said the place was packed so we understood and the food came out perfect. Eddie V's definitely exceeded my expectations!"}
{"text":"My CEO was livid.  First we were supposed to be in the speakeasy room as we had 16 people. Originally I requested the lounge but later requested the speakeasy.  I called and spoke with the event coordinator to make sure again that we got the speakeasy room.  When we showed up at the restaurant we were seated right next to the band in the lounge vs the speakeasy room.  We had to wait 20 minutes to be seated there.  We were hungry and the tables were not set up.  After being seated we waited another half hour for a waiter to come by just to order wine and appetizers.  We had to get up and track down a manager to serve us.  He was great but a little too late.  After finally getting our wine and appetizers and finishing that, we waited again about 15-20 minutes for a waiter and finally had to track down a waiter again to order food.  We spent over $3,000 to get such terrible service and to be put in a place right next to a loud band.  Not cool.  Would not recommend for large groups."}
{"text":"I was here for a lunch and learn. The crab and corn chowder soup was delicious. The private dining room is a great space if you need to rent out a space for an intimate setting. Staff is very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"If you don't go to Eddie V's Happy Hour (Reservations recommended, really!) and partake in the delish food and beverages then you just do not LIVE!   Where to begin.  SO, I don't really like going to The Quarter.  Parking is a bitch and it's quite a walk to get anywhere good (Eddie's does offer valet though) but we were getting Pedi's at Dolce and I wanted to take my Mom for a Spa treat and dinner.  Oh, and she was the designated driver because, have you HAD their Cosmo?  It's a triple pour Vodka for $6.00!!  And it's probably the best Cosmo I have had hands down!  Being gluten free by disease, I have to make absolute sure that both the cooks and waiter understands this.  I had an issue the previous time with a biscotti being put in my fruit dessert....but THIS visit we had Joey G. and he rocked!  We were there at 5:15 so we could dine before the very loud music began at 6:00. We shared a shrimp cocktail and each had a gluten free hot crab cake.  Great place for a celebration...but make sure you make reservations even for Happy Hour!  The place is usually full!"}
{"text":"We had an amazing experience at Eddie V's. Our server was Petros and he took superb care of us and was a professional at his job. Our steaks were perfect and was medium rare throughout which most steak houses fail at. Food was not too salty and the lobster was sweet with great texture. Great wine list as well. Fantastic evening."}
{"text":"Hear this all you fancy-schmancy dining establishments that got 2 or 3 stars from me for charging prices you didn't live up to  -  MY BEST RESTAURANT EXPERIENCE IN THE LAST YEAR WAS AT EDDIE V's AND I GLADLY SPENT EVEN MORE BECAUSE OF IT.  Eddie V's gets it.  Figure out what's important to each person at the table, especially the one paying the check, and give it to them.  They picked up on our personalities right away (me the persnickety curmudgeon and my dining partner the obnoxious boor) and gave each of us what we wanted (me perfectly executed food and reasonably priced good wine and, I'll admit, some kissing up for my stepping up for the $$$$$; and my dining partner got someone to laugh at his witty banter).  I had asked for a quiet table in our online res, and they did seat us in a booth in the corner not too close to the tourists and per diem-ers.  We had a wonderful time.  The restaurant is lovely, dimly lit, white tablecloths.  Our booth was near the wine room so I could gaze longingly at the bottles when the conversation waned.   We ordered and ordered, shrimp cocktail, bisque, salad for appearances sake, filet, some other wonderful shellfish entree I'm allergic to so can't recall and the best dessert I've had in a while, that flaming bananas foster cake with butter pecan ice cream good enough to bring a southern girl to her knees.    So we're thinking as we walk out into the Scottsdale Quarter shops that we should probably walk off some of this feast.  We really did try, but only got as far as the parking garage.  It's hard walking with 40 extra pounds of dinner in you.  The car's suspension took a beating on the way home to be sure.  Worth every penny and generous tip.  Thank you Eddie V's for restoring my faith in fine dining establishments."}
{"text":"Excellent food with a taste of elegance and class. The seafood is fresh and ambient atmosphere. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This is one of the best fine dining experiences I have had. The food is amazing ! They have all types of fresh steaks but I love the seafood. I ordered the filet of sole, I got about four filets that were cooked perfect and were off the hook flavorful. The service is better than average and could possibly be a bit better but I attribute the slight delays to the volume of people they accommodate due to the quality of their food. On popular days and times you might have to wait. It is worth the wait though and they are not in a hurry to throw you out. They also have live music several days a week and a large well stoked bar. Worth the extra pesos...!"}
{"text":"One of our go to places and favorites! The live jazz is fantastic and six nights a week. Add in some discounted wines and bites were sold on a Monday night. Tony was promoted to manager and he's always made sure everything was perfect. This past Valentine's Day they made our night very special on every level. My fiancé and I are out constantly downtown and travel so we do have high expectations of venues like this and steakhouses in general and this place has become our go to. I had the butterfish, the Alaskan long crab and sea bass the last few times and always have some of his steak. Every side is great and generous portions and their oysters are amazing. Perfect for a date or post work drinks and apps!"}
{"text":"Wow. In town for the Fiesta Bowl, looking for New Years Day dinner destination. Outstanding food, service, ambiance."}
{"text":"I expected Eddie V's to be a fairly traditional steakhouse/seafood experience, but it way exceeded my expectations.  In addition to the top knotch service, the food was just delicious and much more inventive than I expected.  I had the seared tuna in a sushi/tempura preparation and it was honestly the best seared tuna dish I've ever had.  Sides like broccolini were perfectly prepared.  Service was formal but attentive and helpful.  Seems like  a great special occasion or business dinner restaurant, but I would return for sure just for the amazing food!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite steak house in Scottsdale. There are many good places and we've been to just about all of them. I've been more satisfied with Eddie V's much more than their competition. We love Oysters and they have a great selection of fresh ones. They also know how to char a steak correctly and the Chilean sea-bass was prepared perfectly. We ordered the 8 oz. filet and the sea-bass for our surf and turf and we were very happy with it.  Service was also great and the Restaurant is not as noisy As others. We loved it."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a must try.  My waitress Hollie was very well mannered. The food was to die for. I would love to have one in Philadelphia."}
{"text":"Ok. So EVERYTHING was great. Every dish was done with skill & care.  Not a cheap place but it's worth it. Come here in a special occasion & make it memorable. Jumbo Shrimp with sprinkled crab was solid. Lobster tacos were extremely fresh. Server Mike did a great job."}
{"text":"My son has been wanting us to try Eddie V's for awhile because him and his friend has visited a few times during HH. Anyways, we got an early reservation. When we walked in it was dimly lit and really nice inside. Little upscale.   We started off with the Point Judith Calamari and the Jumbo Crab cakes. The calamari was very different cause it had green onions peppers. So most Calamari is just stacked up. Not here but it was very good. Nice and crispy on the outside and cooked perfectly. The Crab Cake was jumbo just like they described. Huge. Fall apart cake. You can taste the freshness of the crab. Really good.   I had the Special of the night which was Chilean Sea Bass (wild caught). It was broiled. The one on the menu is steamed. I really liked it broiled. Very moist. Cooked perfectly. It came with asparagus and was very good too. We got sides of Brussels sprouts with bacon & shallots and sautéed spinach with garlic & Parmesan. I really like the Brussels sprouts. Cooked perfectly and that touch of bacon made it really good. The Spinach was just as good too. Loved all our sides.   My wife had the Alaskan Halibut (wild caught). I got a taste and it was very good. Very moist. Very tender. My wife enjoyed it a lot.   Of course we had to try their dessert. It's a must. All I remember is that I ordered the hot blackberry cobbler. Boy was that good. Nice and warm with a flakey crust with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top. So good. Really enjoyed it.   So the service was exceptional. Our server knew the menu and described the dishes correctly. Very informed. Continued to fill our water cups, cleared our dishes in a timely manner, and always cleared our crumbs from our table. Very good service.   So overall this was a very good place. Fresh seafood. Wild caught which I think is important for seafood. Exceptional service and a very dimly lit dining experience. Around 7pm there was a live band in the bar area.  Enjoyed our dinner and since it's so close we will probably be back again."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of going to Eddie V's for a work dinner so we selected off of an abbreviated menu. We were there on a weeknight and they had a band, that was quite good, covering some of today's hits.   Highlights for me were the bread, it was served hot, crusty on the outside, soft on the inside. The Cesar salad was actually very good. The dressing had a great balance of acidity and creamy texture. The sirloin was cooked to perfection for me. Dessert included bananas foster, which was phenomenal.  Service was beyond excellent. Eddie V's is truly a great dining experience from start to finish."}
{"text":"Eddie V's used to be one of our favorite splurges - unfortunately, as sometimes it happens with successful restaurants it is my opinion they have gotten a little comfortable and it has effected service and in my experience, quality.  The first two times we had quality or service issues we let it slide everyone has a bad day and usually the misstep with food was handled.  Our last visit was horrible.  Started out with Bartender, our friend ordered a Sazerac, She made it in two seconds, normally it takes a bit longer, and he didn't enjoy it. He didn't make a big deal he just asked for another drink The bartender was arrogant and argued with him on the quality of her drink. He didn't question the quality he just didn't like it. Then mealtime, my husbands fish came to the table overcooked and an extremely small portion.  A complaint was made, nothing  happened. My husband ended up Sharing food from the rest of our friends until finally he got up and asked for someone to come over to the table and when the waitress Finally did everyone was finished. He requested to speak with a manager, again, when the person arrived they agreed, That piece of fish should never been brought to the table, why didn't the chef or the waitress notice that.  Again maybe getting a little too comfortable. We do not go out looking for something for free but when you're buying bottles of wine and spending a lot of money and your in  a group of seven, not even offering dessert? I was  so surprised - I have reviewed Eddie V's before, with an amazing experience on many occasions but that was years ago in our last three experiences there were just OK. Sadly three strikes, we are now looking for a new special place to enjoy.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"We went here to celebrate our 52nd anniversary. They had lovely red rose petals on the table and a happy anniversary card signed by all of the staff. The wine list is excellent and the prices reasonable. The food was outstanding and our waiter Rocco was very helpful and considerate. The manager, RICHARD came over to welcome us and made sure everything was to our satisfaction. We enjoyed all of the food from the homemade bread to the final dessert and coffee. I can highly recommend this place and in addition they had a musical group playing in the background that added to the ambience. The Chilean Seabass broiled to perfection was outstanding and the filet was made exactly to order and was tender and delicious."}
{"text":"Definitely a great place!  Very nice food and drinks. Very good wine selection and nice craft drinks too."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places for happy hour. The chilled shrimp is cooked perfectly and I swear it'll be the best crab cake you'll have on this side of the country. If you like a classic dirty martini like me try the dirty devil with blue cheese olives. For dinner we split the New York Strip and added the sautéed brussel sprouts and the beets with candied walnuts. All of which was absolutely amazing. The bananas foster butter cake is not to be forgotten. They flambéd it tableside and I thought I was in heaven every time I took a bit. The service was also amazing. Attentive yet not intrusive! For a special occasion or just a night out with the boys or girls this is a fantastic choice."}
{"text":"Service was great at times, also poor at times...very inconsistent through out dinner.  Restaurant has a great atmosphere.  Bar area was very nice and a large drink selection.  The one thing that bothered us all is the gap between appetizers/salads and the main entree...way too long (30+ minutes).  As for the food...Lobster bisque was very good.  Sea Bass in light soy sauce with ginger and spinach was very good.  Others in our group had the scallops and all said they were not seared off enough...broccolini was just OK was kind of bland, brussel sprouts were too hard and not cooked enough, but the lobster mashed potatoes were excellent.  All in all somewhat disappointed considering the cost...they need to up there game if they want to charge those prices.  Lastly, waited 20 minutes for car at valet."}
{"text":"Eddie V's Happy hour is the best!  Try the Lobster Taco's or the Ahi Tuna.  I am a realtor and refer all my out of town clients here and they always love it!"}
{"text":"A very good place to eat- Everyone knows about the happy hour- half price apps- Oysters, salads, soup- All quality stuff- I especially like the Kung Pao (I agree there's way too much kung pao) Calalmari and Shrimp Fritters.  Great steaks too!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant went above and beyond for our special occasion. My boyfriend only gets Monday's off and it's tough finding a nice place that is open on a Monday. We had an amazing dinner. They gave us an intimate table and the service was amazing. I can't stop thinking about the goat cheese arugula salad!!!! If you aren't a steak eater, that is not a problem. The seafood is spectacular. I had the Maine lobster taco! And you cannot forget the truffle Mac and cheese. Save room for dessert!"}
{"text":"Best lobster & filet I've ever had!!! Both were so amazingly tender and flavorful!!!  Just scrumptious! Our waiter was helpful and attentive, but not intrusive. The wine & dessert were also delicious."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for dinner last weekend and it was wonderful! Our waiter was exceptional and very attentive to our needs. We started with the seafood tower and it had some of the freshest seafood I have ever tasted. The lobster was perfect, the oyster and shrimp were huge and the crab meat was delicious. For dinner, my husband ordered the snapper and I had the 8oz filet and lobster tail. The steak was cooked to perfection and the blue cheese sauce on the side was the perfect complement. For dessert, we had the banana's foster, which I would highly recommend. The General Manager was walking around the whole night checking in on tables and was very friendly with all of the guests. I would definitely recommend Eddie V's to anyone looking for a perfect date night in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Excellent meal.  Food was perfectly done.  Service was great.  Atmosphere was very nice but not spectacular.  Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Stopped by for their happy hour food and drinks which runs from 4 PM to 10 PM!!! Started with their Columbia Valley Cab and central coast Pinoy Noir which are great deals for $7!! Then started with 12 west coast oysters (super fresh!!), their fried Thai oysters (not bad), crab fried rice (really delish!!) and lobster fried wontons (just ok)!! Finally got the lamb shanks which was really tasty!! Overall great deal at this place!!!"}
{"text":"Had a fantastic time On Mother's Day!  Guy pennacchio was there doing a God and it was fantastic!  Lisette was our server and she was wonderful!  Food was real good!  Loved it will be back"}
{"text":"I was referred by several friends and Eddie Vs did not disappoint. The three of us tried several different appetizers and meals. We requested the truffle Mac n cheese and asked to add lobster added. Amazing!  Angela was our server and she was so attentive and gave great recommendations."}
{"text":"Have eaten at many, many fine food establishments, even in New York. This restaurant is in my top 5 places to eat for phenomenal good food and exceptional service. The South African cold water lobster tails were outstanding and reminded me of lobsters eaten in Boston. Sweet, tender, succulent....just delicious.  We celebrated our 35th years anniversary and was treated to a free flaming dessert. Eddie V's is perfect for that special evening or celebration. Their happy hour in the lounge, offers some delicious appetizers and discounted drinks. I look forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Just, Yes. Atmosphere... check. Service... exquisite. Cuisine... sublime. And jazz to beat the band. A special occasion place that will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Ok... So this place was amazing.  We had the salt n pepper shrimp at the bar during happy hour which was divine!  Christopher made a perfect dirty martini and my man had the house Cab which he enjoyed. We had dinner reservations at 5:00 and started with the calamari and 2 oysters Rockafeller.  We both said the calamari just may have been the absolute best calamari we've ever had. It was so tender and delicious. Not too sweet. Not too spicy. It was perfect.  I had the Chilean Sea bass and he had the Twin filets. We also shared the butter poached lobster mashed potatoes and crab fried rice.  Everything was excellent. The crab fried rice had a little strong herb taste that neither of us were blown away by, but it was still delicious, just probably wouldn't order it next time. The lobster mashed were delicious but definitely over kill with all the other food we had.  Everything was so good, we just wanted to try it all.  We also had completely unnecessary desserts... the Godiva chocolate cake and creme brûlée.  Again... excellent.   Brandan R was our server and he was an absolute JOY! He was genuinely concerned if we enjoyed everything, and more than attentive. Very personable and super sweet! Tony, the manager, also stopped numerous times to check on us, and make sure every step of the meal was perfect. He was so accommodating and hospitable.   Overall, we were thoroughly impressed by our first visit here and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very good experience here a couple of months back. Atmosphere is great, service impeccable, and the lobster tail was good. My side dishes, potato, and Caesar salad were adequate. Price was in line for the meal I felt. It's very difficult to find quality seafood in Phoenix, and I don't like disappointment, so I would say Eddie V's is a safe bet."}
{"text":"We had the best dinner here tonight. Starting with cocktails at the bar to the seafood tower which blew our socks off to an incredible set of entrees and delicious desert it was the BEST MEAL we've had in Charlotte. Our server assistant, Tyler, made the experience. He was friendly, attentive, considerate, and all around one of the best waiters we've had. He truly made the evening incredible. Our bartender, Mallory, made the best martini I've had in Charlotte as well. Everything about the restaurant was incredible. The food was incredible and the wine selection sealed the deal. We could not have imagined a better evening on the town and I will recommend this restaurant to anyone. Thank you for an incredible evening and a huge thank you to Mallory, Tyler, and Bren (the manager) who took extra special care of us this evening. I look forward to coming back again soon."}
{"text":"Sadly this was a huge let down.   First, the service was subpar, the waiter was slow in moving the courses along.  He took my order wrong and then insisted that I was in the wrong and that's not what I ordered despite pointing to it on the menu.  It took over an hour between appetizers to entree.  Second, the bernaise  sauce tasted like straight vinegar.  The waiter insisted that it was fine despite everyone at the table cringing when they tasted it.  The filet mignon was bland.  The oysters were so small that it was difficult to even get them out of the shell and onto the fork.   And they were sold as oysters from Puget Sound and they were not. We are very familiar with Washington State oysters. Oysters from that area of the country have a very distinct texture, almost velvety and they tend to be quite large.   For this level of dining, I expect more.   There are so many amazing restaurants in and around The Scottsdale area, skip this one and try something else."}
{"text":"Amazing restuarant!  Very nice/romantic setting and absolutely awesome food and service  Have ordered oysters here a few times and they are top notch, great presentation served on ice/salt and very fresh  Appetitizers included Hamachi sashimi, and Point Judith kung pao style calamari. Both were great, hamachi fresh and calamari had a nice crispy breading and great flavor profile.  Main dish was Georges Bank Scallops, which came sauteed with citrus fruit, roasted almonds, and brown butter. COMPLETELY AWESOME! Very nice minimal flavors that go great together and accentuate the scallop richness.  Also has a great wine menu  Very pricy, VERY WORTH IT"}
{"text":"This is a very nice, upscale steak and seafood restaurant.  The service is excellent, but the food was lacking in flavor.  The portions are large and it is very filling.  Unfortunately the flavors are just not there.  Bland jumbo shrimp, bland sea bass, and bland ahi tuna.  The seafood is very fresh, but the preparation is just not up to the expectation for such a nice restaurant."}
{"text":"Eddie V's is a large restaurant, but against our wishes we were seated in Siberia.  This was a small room completely separate from the restaurant. It had the atmosphere of a doctors waiting room. My wife liked her sole.  My pot stickers tasted like the before mentioned Siberian salt mine and the crab fried rice was flavorless. For close to $150 we were less than impressed. Service was efficient, but not friendly.  Kind of a wasted Saturday night Dinner with my wife.  It was kind of like when you  expect more and get less."}
{"text":"The Kierland Eddie V's holds true to the high standard of their brand.  I was promptly greeted at the door by the host staff, and personally met the manager. A bar stool had my name on it for happy hour dining and drinks.  My happy hour app choices were the Carpetbagger (a small plate of an oyster/beef pairing), the shrimp cocktail, and the regular menu item of the lobster tacos. All of this with a fantastic pre-meal Manhattan (up) and a Pinot Noir with my snack.  The bartender was attentive and friendly, and the manager circulated the floor to ensure a great experience.  I always find the Eddie V's bar to be a great social experience. A retired couple to my left who also loved their dining experience, and to my right, two in-state tourists who ended up dragging me to an Old Town salsa club later in the eve!"}
{"text":"I have not eaten at Eddie V's but I have had the pleasure of partaking in a liquid dinner.  :)  This place is great if you want to kick back with an awesome martini, listen to some GREAT music, and just relax.  It's also a great date place if you want to cuddle up in addition to those three things.  It's pretty dark in the bar (the restaurant in general) and while the restaurant seemed pretty loud, the bar seems like its own little world  It's like a bar you would find in New York or San Francisco.  I highly recommend it and can't wait to go back for a real dinner!"}
{"text":"I cannot believe how long it has taken me to finally visit this place. My husband and I took my Mom for her 73rd birthday while she was in town, and I am so glad we did. Love the ambience--service was impeccable.  And the fact that I know that I can actually get damned good seafood in the desert is comforting. I am mostly writing this review for the SCALLOPS. You get SIX of these people. Not 3, not 4, but SIX big plump sweet scallops in a citrus glaze that compliments these little beauties perfectly. I had also ordered a lobster tail; too tough, not tasty. But without any hesitation, the manager took it off the bill. We even had a convo about Maine vs Australian and our agreed preference for the latter. The soups are AMAZING and my Hun and Mum devoured their chosen fish entrees. And with all the class of a GOOD restaurant, my mom got her choice of a free dessert (bananas' foster--not to be missed). I don't mind spending money on a good meal, and Eddie Vs is an example of a place I will return to time and time again."}
{"text":"Ok, so this spinoff of Capital Grille takes it to the next level. You must try the smoked old fashioned, one of the best I've had. Their kung pao calamari rivals the CG's with cherry peppers. The service has been outstanding. This ain't McCormick & Schmick. We had the Chilean sea bass and scallops which were life-changing. The bananas foster dessert is otherworldly. You must eat here."}
{"text":"I would have given Eddie V's 5 stars, however I made reservations weeks in advance and somehow still had to wait for 30 minutes to get a table.   Now that the complaining is over:  The food is excellent. My boyfriend and I were visiting Phoenix for a holiday getaway and I spent a pretty hefty amount of time looking for a fine dining restaurant to splurge at. I landed on Eddie V's and made a reservation on OpenTable for 8pm on a Saturday. When we showed up, the crowd was a little older than we thought it would be, but we were seated in a nice booth overlooking the dining room and with views into the lounge, where there was a love band playing. Very nice. Our server, Eduardo, was fast, attentive and overall a top notch guy.  We ordered the batter fried oysters appetizer, which were good but a little heavy on the curry spice that was in the sauce. Nice, though. For main courses (we skipped second courses because we weren't all that hungry), I ordered the 8oz filet mignon and broiled lobster tail. My boyfriend ordered the Chilean sea bass. Both were exceptional. My filet came out cooked perfectly (I ordered it medium) and the lobster was succulent and sweet. The Chilean sea bass, cooked \"Hong Kong style\" which meant steamed and served in a flavorful broth on a bed of spinach and under a bamboo basket, was moist and delicious.  We ordered the sautéed spinach on the side- we ordered a small but were given a large. It was good, with big shavings of Parmesan and roasted garlic.  For dessert, we ordered the bananas foster cake on the recommendation of several fellow yelpers and we were NOT disappointed. Eduardo came out and lit a gravy boat full of liqueur on fire and poured it onto the bananas atop the cake. What a show, and DAMN what a good dessert. Buttery cake, sweet caramelized bananas and out of this world butter pecan ice cream. I wish I could have finished it but we were both too stuffed to carry on.   We got out for under $200 after tip, and I felt  the service and the quality of the food we were served was well worth the money.   All in all, a classy and awesome dining experience. I will definitely return for that banana cake if I find myself in AZ again."}
{"text":"Me and my gf came here for dinner. We ordered   1. House salad 2. Rib eye med 3. Grill Lobster  4. Lobster mash potatoes  5. 2 cocktails   Price: $150  Service: excellent   Food quality: steak was good and cooked to perfection. However lobster was terrible. It was frozen lobster, not fresh. I could've go to a chinese seafood restaurant and get better lobster quality for half the price. They put seafood in the name and for the price I expected fresh and not frozen.  Therefore 3 stars for the good steak, do not get the lobster."}
{"text":"Came to Eddie Vs for the first time last night after hearing great reviews. We will definitely be back. The food was amazing...and the bananas foster were a hit! Our server Krissy was amazing. Krissy in passing heard my mom mention she enjoys cookies. To our surprise, Krissy brought out a couple of cookies with dessert. From beginning to end we thoroughly enjoyed our time."}
{"text":"Five star restaurant with five star quality! Eddie's V's is hands down the best restaurant for seafood in Pittsburgh. I've been to all that you can name and nothing comes close. They don't call it prime seafood for no reason, because that's exactly what it is.  My date was celebrating her birthday on a busy Friday evening and the experience was everything that we could've asked for and then some. She was greeted with a happy birthday note and even got her choice of a complimentary dessert. Fun and festive decorations were placed on our table which I should mention was the best seat on the house in our opinion.  For the second time I ordered the Norwegian salmon which is prepared crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. The best part of it all has to be the bananas foster which they flambé tableside. Perfection!"}
{"text":"Ok I would say 3.5/5 My bf liked this restaurant more than I did. I know I know I am a vegetarian so I should not even be rating a seafood restaurant but I will anyways ;) We sat in the lounge on Saturday night and there was a live band playing. It was nice. But the surrounding was kinda meh - not a lot of younger people (like Mastros or Dominicks), more older crowd.  We ordered the Heirloom Tomato Greek Salad as a large side to split for our appz - SUPER good! And they split it into 2 plates which we loved. My bfs Greek and he said this was def authentic! I like how you are able to choose a small or large side ($5 or $8) however one major thing I didn't like is that there were no sauteed mushrooms :( I know it's not a steakhouse but commmon! We tried the Sautéed Spinach with Parmigiano-Reggiano and the Steamed Asparagus with Hollandaise. Spinach was meh but asparagus was good! I got the 16 vegetable salad (Xeres Vinaigretttte and Goat Cheese Fondant) $13 .. ok this was TINY but there was def 16 types of veggies in it but that was it. It was good otherwise. My bf got the Louisiana Red Fish (Sautéed withth Fresh Lump Crab, Meunière Style) $27 . It was really big and he said he liked it but too heavy on the sauce. Overall the place was nice, if you're into seafood&older crowd this is the place to be"}
{"text":"I don't  want this review to discourage you from going; I want it to make you aware they may have significant kitchen issues when it comes to the cooked food.  I really like the feel of the place; have eaten there twice.  Highly recommend sitting at the bar and eating the sushi/seafood.  Here's where the problem came from:  after Sushi (which was fabulous), we decided to try main courses.  We ordered a prime new york strip (they were out of prime filets) with the crab & asparagus topping (approx. $55 - not cheap, but worth it if the kitchen knows how to make it), along with the fried oysters as recommended by the bartender.  Sounds like a truly decadent meal, right?  WRONG!!!!!!  The Medium-Rare Steak, not only came out fully cooked, but even worse, came out as what I call \"baked steak\" - slowly cooked.  I couldn't believe it.  So, if you want a prime steak, personally, I would go to a restaurant that is good at making them, such as Flemings or Mortons or Maestros.  If you still decide to go here & want to have steak, be warned.  Also, they forgot to deliver our fried oysters and when I asked how much longer for the oysters, they suddenly appeared, completely cold.  So, we had a very very disappointing meal.  However, I would still definitely go back to sit at the bar and have sushi."}
{"text":"Nick was our waiter on a special night and we couldn't have asked for a more charming and competent host. He walked me down the stairs arm in arm to show me to the ladies room in style and ballroom grace. You the quality of the fare was only surpassed by nicks charm and highly competent service. Brynn, made a memorable night even more enjoyable with her personal attention as manager of this establishment. Eddie V's is definitely our first choice for our next special occasion. Thank you all."}
{"text":"Where do I start, first things first the service was exceptional. The servers are personable and go above and beyond. They do things before you even need to ask. My water glass was always full. (Impressive) Now let's talk food!! Umm, ummm, ummmm perfection in every bite.   Starters: shrimp cocktail (3/5) is was ok the shrimp was a decent size the cocktail sauce is good, horseradish is the bomb literally atomic. Only reason I give it 3 stars is because it's just an ok starter when their are better options on the menu. Like...  The steak and lobster tartare (5/5) so many different flavors that go great together. The steak Tartare is butter to the lobster.  Entree:  Hong Kong Chilean seabass(4/5) the seabass was perfect buttery and flakey. Only thing is I won't order it prepared that way again. The ginger is over powering but still is an excellent dish. I'm the one who ordered it prepared that way. Next time would like to try the simply grilled.   Bone-in Ribeye (5*/5)  WOW this ribeye blows any other ribeye out of the water. I ranted and raves about this ribeye. You can cut it with a butter knife its so tender and flavorful. I can't wait to go back and order this again !! It's a must!   As for sides, gotta do the twice baked potato it's super creamy and whipped to perfection. The Brussels sprouts were prepared with bacon and onion, the best. As for the asparagus, it was simple. I won't be getting those next time and I can make better at home and I'm not even a great cook.    And if you have from for dessert. Don't miss the creme brûlée or blackberry cobbler! Your in for a treat.   Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed a fabulous dinner at Eddie V's last night. The dinner was well seasoned and prepared. The environment was pleasant in spite of the restaurant's cavernous appearance. Jovial live jazz played by the bar could be heard throughout. Staff moved about quietly and were never disruptive. What a difference from the awful experience at Mastros Ocean Club! Will certainly return."}
{"text":"Food and service were excellent - the Dover Sole was outstanding, a bit spendy, but you get what you pay for...I'd go back for sure."}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant. Beautiful decor, nicely spaced tables, multiple rooms and a teriffic seperate Bar room. Fresh seafood, well  prepared dishes with effecient and friendly service. Live music in the bar every evening. Ecpensive but teriffic!!!!"}
{"text":"We were so fortunate to be able to get reservations at Eddie V's during restaurant week what a wonderful elegant evening it was. We had the prix fix menu and my husband had some oysters on the half shell that were beautifully presented. Not that it mattered as he slurped them right down! We had the lobster bisque soup and potstickers for our appetisers. I needed some siracha for the potstickers as I like a little heat. They were very crispy and tasty. My husband loved his soup as he used the bread to get every bit out of his bowl. Our entrees were filet and shrimp scampi ( up charge of $5) and the lemon sole. My lemon sole came out hot and light and crispy!! It was delicious!! My husband loved his meal. We also got to order a side too. He got the truffle Mac and cheese and I had the steamed asparagus. It was too much food but we did our best to do damage. As we were trying to get comfortable the dessert came. I had the banana fosters cake it was delicious and my hubby got the chocolate Godiva cake. Everything was super! The service was outstanding!"}
{"text":"This is a FIVE star restaurant--anything posted to the contrary is just wrong (or the hater has no idea how to order a decent meal).  Excellent steaks, fresh high quality seafood and inspired combinations.  Bravo, Eddie V's!  I started with the Tartare of Pacific Tuna (curry and sesame oils, avocado, mango and citrus), followed by a second course of Crab and Corn Chowder (smoked bacon, potatoes and sweet corn).  In all honesty, if there were a power outage or other catastrophe that ceased all kitchen function at that point, I would have left completely satisfied with my meal.  The tuna was superb, and the citrus/mango perfectly complimented the ample-sized fish stack.  The Chowder was also noteworthy--a hearty, flavorful effort to be savored.  But my main course was simply spectacular.  I had the 22oz USDA Prime Bone-In Ribeye, paired with the Brussels sprouts, bacon and shallots.  The steak was melt-in-your-mouth tender and exquisitely flavored, and the sprouts were equally delicious.  I even sampled a bit of my dining companion's crab fried rice, which was a unique and welcome departure from the go-to baked potato.  I really don't think you could miss ordering off of the expansive Eddie V's menu.  The meal left me with just one disappointment--why are you not located in Utah?!?!  Thanks for a terrific meal, Eddie V's!"}
{"text":"Started with Peach Mule - amazing. Peaches were very sweet. Never ending Happy Hour from Sunday to Thursday - genius!  Ordered several appetizers from Happy Hour menu.  Got the fish tacos, salt & pepper shrimp, calamari, potstickers and lamb lollipops - all very tasty and perfectly priced :)  Being Asian, I had to try the crab fried rice.  It hit the spot. You could taste the crab and mushrooms. I could not pinpoint the flavoring but it was familiar. This alone will make me come back. I opted for the 25-karat cocktail next. It paired beautifully with the fried rice.   Of course I cannot leave without mentioning our waiter, Matt. What a pro!  Very matter-of-factly but friendly.  He gets six stars.   Interior had a comfortable design. Most importantly it was perfectly lit. Dim enough to be cozy but still able to read the menu and see your food.   Looking forward to our next visit. Five-star rating well earned."}
{"text":"First and foremost. Thank you for making my mom's birthday week so enjoyable. From the beginning our experience was excellent. We came for the Preview Night event. We were greeted at the door and were ushered into the lobby where the hostess welcomed us and gave us the option to go to the bar for a drink first or be immediately seated. I had made my reservation with Gem who was the hostess that seated us and I thanked her for helping me find a reservation time and date that for both my mom's and my schedule. Tyler was our waiter and he was attentive and knew just wanted to suggest for my mom. There was a live band playing and I asked one of the staff who they were  Dominica (  i apologize if I misspelled) relayed  the artist was  AJ Degrassi from California. He covered all genres  of song  while still allowing table conversation to happen without having to raise our voices. I hope there will be weekly live music. The atmosphere is upscale but thembience is relaxed. They have local craft beers available. I had OMB's Hornet's Nest. My mom had their Red Dragon cocktail- definitely recommend. I don't know if it was because it was preview night or not but at Eddie V's there is no skimping on portion sizes. We started with gulf shrimp cocktails and calamari. The calamari could've been an entree itself. It had a Asian glaze sauce with Asian cabbage and carrot mixed in . There's also cashews so nut allergies be advised. Next were our entrees: Parmesan crusted sole with veggies and Bacon wrapped filet with Alaska King Crab and asparagus. I kid you not every bite was flavorful and cooked so well. Truffle Mac & Cheese: Definitely do it. Again the portion sizes are plenty so we asked Tyler to box up the remaining for tomorrow. We ended with a Banana Butter Cream Cake- decadent and sweet! Added bonus it comes with  a scoop butter pecan ice cream. My mom was trying to figure out the recipe to make at home. It was an awesome experience at Eddie V's. My mom and I plan to come back as a special treat every year. The price point is much higher than the average restaurant but the the experience is worth it from the welcoming hostesses, attentive staff,  delicious drinks, savory entrees and decadent deserts. I would definitely recommend Eddie V's Please be advised there are a lot of steps; there is low lighting to add to the ambience so watch your steps. Also the bathroom is downstairs. I'm not sure if there is another bathroom near the bar and the band stage ."}
{"text":"This place was amazing from start to finish. First of all, it is beautiful inside. My boyfriend and I went on a Wednesday evening. I called at about 7 and they said they could fit us in at 8:30. Second of all, our service was outstanding. Our server, Thomas, paid very close attention to us. He heard me tell my boyfriend I didn't love mushrooms and when he brought out our warm goat cheese, mushroom, and arugula salad, not only did he split the salad for us, but he put my mushrooms on the side. How thoughtful! My boyfriend had the pearl point oysters which were incredible. I had the steak and tuna tartare. We both liked the tuna better than the steak but it was still perfectly prepared. I had the filet medallions Oscar style and it was one of the best meals I've ever had. The steak was perfectly cooked as was the asparagus - I like mine a little crunchy, not soggy. My boyfriend had the halibut and the flavors and sauce went together incredibly well. We also ordered the Brussel sprouts which neither of us were a big fan, but it obviously won't keep us from returning. After our meal, we went to the bar for an after dinner drink and dessert. My boyfriend had the bananas foster...DELICIOUS. I had the smores dessert and it was okay-I would prefer a stronger marshmallow flavor. Last but not least, they have live music every single night. I hope this place keeps it up for the long-term as it will probably become one of our new favorites. I am excited to return with my mom...she will love it."}
{"text":"I have eaten at other Eddie V's, but this is the first time I have eaten at the one located in the Scottsdale Quarter. The jazz band there was fantastic! The ambience was very nice, and my guest and I ate at the bar. The bartender knew her stuff, and poured very stiff drinks. I normally would have had a steak, but I was talked into the double cut lamb chops. They were very flavorful and only had a hint of mint. Unlike some lamb chops that are drowned in mint jelly, these were perfectly prepared. I recommend you try Eddie V's instead of Dominic's the next time you are at the Scottsdale Quarter."}
{"text":"Everything was fabulous! The hostess at the host stand was very polite and sweet! Our server was adorable, knowledgeable and provided outstanding customer service! The happy hour menu was phenomenal, lots of options and great prices! We had the steak tartare, crab cake, shrimp cocktail and calamari and all were DELICIOUS! The manager checked on our table a few times and he was wonderful! The live music was also a nice touch! I will definitely return!!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, service and food.  The Restaurant was packed on Friday night but we lucked out and got a table by the wine room (technically bar seating), but it was very cozy and even a little romantic.  Our waitress, Gem, could not have been friendlier, more knowledgeable or attentive.  The manager was also working hard to make sure everyone was taken care of and enjoying their evening.  Live music also played in the bar area, it sounded great.  We ordered a tuna appetizer, crab cake and swordfish.  My wife is still raving about the crab cake.  The Brussel sprouts were very good and fairly unique.  Just an overall classy place.  There are two levels of seating and some tables are definitely more desirable but all are very nice.  If your looking for a fancy celebration restaurant, this is a great choice.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"The food was very good. The steak was good, I've had better. The scallops were very good. Scallops are tricky to get right. The green broccoli would have been a little better if cut up a little more and not just a bushel on a plate. the atmosphere is dark but private, but I would like to see my food. We didn't have a reservation but the found a table for us. I recommend reservations. It is pricy."}
{"text":"Moved from Portland about a month ago, I've been to Eddie V's twice now. Once with my brother and once with my wife. Both times there was live music in the bar area, great service, fantastic food, happening place!"}
{"text":"Our company attends a conference in town every year and we have always held a team dinner at Eddie V's. The reason we have always returned is the great food and excellent service.   Not sure what has happened but all of that loyalty was washed away last night due to a terrible experience.   This was a special celebration as our vp is moving on to a new adventure so we really wanted it to be special.   The service was very slow and the server kept banging into one of my guests chair even after being asked to be careful. When he took drink orders he totally skipped two people in our party of eight  I could go on and on with the service issues  The food has gone from excellent to mediocre at best. The Sea Bass used to be the best thing on the menu but it is now swamped with so much sauce that it is so salty that it is almost uneatable. In addition one of our guest found a piece of foil in their dinner.   Needless to say after spending $1,000+ for our dinner we all came away very disappointed    The overall feel is that we are now a big corporate restaurant that will fill up every night regardless. That may be the case but it won't be with me or any of our party that attended last evenings dinner."}
{"text":"We visited Eddie V's last Saturday for my birthday dinner and were really looking forward to a great evening, unfortunately that did not happen.  We started with a dozen oysters which were so poorly shucked we sent them back.  Only one oyster out of a dozen looked like the shucker knew what he was doing.  They were torn to shreds.  Simply pitiful.  The waitress handled the situation by stating that the normal shucker was out today and the guy doing the oysters was not as good.  Oh really?   We then waited for an hour to receive our meal.  All the waitress could do was to awkwardly engage us in uncomfortable conversation and keep offering us bread.  The meal was good, no complaints there.  We ordered a bottle of wine and the waitress decided to up-sell me to a more expensive bottle.  No problem, I like suggestions, but the 2013 bottle that was suggested from the menu turned out to be a 2014.  Nice trick that I did not appreciate.  The waitress knew we were a bit frustrated but she just really did nothing at all to improve our experience  No manager checked in with us to see if we were OK.  She did offer us dessert and the Bananas Foster on Butter cake was very good.  All in all we were disappointed and will probably stick with Steak 44 for our next celebration meal."}
{"text":"I've been a parton here since it moved location from Pima Road to Scottsdale Quarter and have never been disappointed.  Crab cakes to die for.  And I had the BEST and most charming server last evening for happy hour.  His name is Alex.  It was only his third day of work and he was brilliant."}
{"text":"Perfect Anniversary Dinner!  We arrived early for our reservation, and we were seated immediately. Our table had rose peddles scatter on it and there was an Anniversary card from the restaurant! Wow!  The staff was amazing and the food was even more amazing! Live music playing in the bar. Truly a perfect evening."}
{"text":"Excelente comida y muy buen servicio, lo único que yo cambiaría es que los platos vienen solos, todo lo cobran aparte, yo agregaría la compaña de los platos para que no pagues $10 extra por un puré de papas"}
{"text":"Ok, so this is one reserved for rare occasions when I really want to \"do it up!\"  My first experience, more than a decade ago, at their former location hooked me.   I think the pricing is fair for what you get. The entire staff is polite, friendly and attentive. Actually the table staff is a bit too attentive. My water glass was refilled after almost every sip I took. I had to tell the guy to relax a bit since I feel compelled to say \"thank you\" any time someone does something at my table. Doing so was actually disrupting the flow of conversation.  The steaks are cooked perfectly. The fish is also always done very well. No room for dessert after appetizer, soup/salad, breads, entree? Suck it up and stuff it in. This is an experience. May as well leave desperate to undo the belt as soon as you get somewhere private. No one says you have to eat anything the next day, right? Well, maybe your Eddie V's leftovers!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I went here last night to celebrate our engagement. She has a very, very severe nut allergy, which we were assured would not be a problem and they would use extreme caution. One of the appetizers had nuts in it and we had to leave immediately. At a restaurant of this caliber, with such a serious medical issue that they were aware of, I was shocked by their carelessness. When I told the waiter it took him 10 minutes to get the check for us, as my fiancé had to use her epipen and go to the hospital. We were not refunded or offered even the dish that made her violently ill to be comped. It was honestly one of the worst dining experiences of my life, due to their lack of care and attention. $400 for appetizers and a trip to the hospital. Stay away."}
{"text":"It's expensive, but the food and service are phenomenal. I had Alaskan Halibut which was cooked to perfection, and a gin and tonic that had a wonderfully healthy serving of gin. A great way to start a night."}
{"text":"A Favorite for certain!  They are attentive to detail and the food/drinks are amazing.  The happy hour has to be the best in N. Scottsdale.  For my birthday we came here with another couple and had fantastic service.  Petros was fun as well as extremely knowledgable.  Didn't miss a beat.  In the bar, Kara is the best server ever!  She knows our order before we do!!   Would come here for happy hour or special occasions anytime!  Elegant room and fun bar atmosphere with live music.  A must see for out of town visitors."}
{"text":"Had dinner here on Aug. 3.  Always good to excellent service; however, our waiter was somewhat intrusive and made us feel rushed which is too bad when you are dropping over $300 for dinner.  Our meals were prepared well.  The seafood tower appetizer is very expensive (overpriced in my opinion) compared to comparable \"seafood\" restaurants in town."}
{"text":"WOW! I mean wow, that's about as a good as you can get with fresh seafood.  Put it this way, it was so good I had to create a yelp account just to brag about it!   My fiancé and I have been to just about every seafood fine dining spot in scottsdale, (mastros, ocean club, papadeauxs, salt cellar, etc.) this takes the cake by far.  Service was great, management was super friendly, food was outstanding! Lobster was the best my fiancé has ever had and my scallops were top notch (I actually let Eric, our waiter, pick my entrée and he couldn't of been more right) Oh yeah, don't forget about the drinks, blue cheese dirty martini absolutely perfect. 10s ACROSS THE BOARD!!!"}
{"text":"Went here in February. It was a delicious meal. Great food. Great atmosphere.. I loved the live music. In the picture is the appetizer that we had, crab and lobster tacos (amazing). I also had the lobster chowder & 1/2lb of king crab legs. Both were fresh and prepared very well. My boyfriend had the filet and lobster (surf & turf) he mentioned that he has had better steaks, but the lobster was superb!!"}
{"text":"I was in Scottsdale AZ with my wife and kids during spring break this year. My wife is a great vacation planner so she typically handles all the dinner reservations.    When the restaurant she reserved cancelled all reservations last minute due to some renovation issues on site, she was frustrated; so I took on the responsibility of finding us another spot for our date night.   Besides its location totally setting the tone, the ambiance exceeded my expectations. It was twice as cozy as you would expect from a stake house. The hostess was polite from the phone till we met in person.   Out butler was in training but was thorough non the less. Every dish was hand crafted to impress.  My favorite fish Chilean sea bass was probably the best recipe I have had anywhere in all my travels in or out the country. The wine selections matched our desire for the night and the Head Chef came out to discuss our delight.   We even took photos outside the epic sign because it was so memorable. Above all it made me look like the avid diner date planner which I am not. My wife kept saying I made a great choice. I wish they had a location in NY. I am a Pesca-vegetarian so I live for good fish eateries. Eddie V's is officially the best seafood restaurant, second to none. Come with a loaded wallet though you will be unloading it and glad to be."}
{"text":"Though the food was excellent, the customer service was by far the worst I've ever experienced for fine dining/ steakhouse. My family and I went to Eddie V's last night for my birthday and EDUARDO our waiter just had a complete attitude throughout the night and was extremely rude to the extent that each person of our party brought up his lack of customer service throughout the night. He was very short with our table and had no patience. To top off the night, my wife tried to surprise me by telling the waiter they it was my birthday. Not only did she have to tell Eduardo multiple times but he ultimately got us the check but never brought anything out for my wife to sing happy birthday with the rest of my family. Only after did we find out that we had to buy a dessert and the way we found this out is by Eduardo having the audacity to call my wife out at our table and tell her that because of her he was yelled out by his manager and that she should have worked it out ahead of time with the hostess. I have friends and family that work for Darden Restaurants and this BY FAR WAS MY WORST EXPERIENCE."}
{"text":"This is one of the best special occasion restaurants I have ever been to! My husband and I were celebrating our anniversary which we noted when we made our reservation. Eddie V's is located in the Union Trust Building in the area that once housed Larrimor's men's clothing.  Although we dressed for the occasion I noticed that most people were dressed business casual.  We had an outstanding waiter named Glenn who catered to all our needs and made sure everything was spot on. Our table was adorned with two roses and there was an anniversary card from the restaurant! How thoughtful of them! We decided to skip the appetizers and start with salads. Before they were brought out we were each given a glass of champagne to celebrate our special day on the house!   I ordered the goat cheese salad with mushrooms and my husband had the Caesar salad. Both salads were delicious!! We had 3 slices of bread with butter on our table. The bread was fresh and good. For our main course I had the stuffed shrimp with crab-meat and my husband had George's bank scallops which was adorned with citrus fruit, almonds, and brown butter. We were seated right by the kitchen so we could watch the chefs prepare the meal. We learned that one executive chefs from McCormick and Schmick had come over here.  Our waiter suggested that we split a vegetable side so we agreed to that and ordered brussel sprouts with bacon and shallots. Since we were one of the first to arrive we got our food fairly quickly. Everything was delicious and believe me we were so full from dinner that we really didn't want to order dessert! I do want to note that if you are not a fish lover Eddie V's also offers all kinds of steaks and yes, there is an entree with tofu as your main course.  So we finally decided to go for dessert. I ordered the hot blackberry cobbler and my husband had the mango sorbet. My cobbler was so big and warm that I had to devour the ice cream before it all melted! Still it was very enjoyable. My husband's sorbet came with two chocolate cookies. When our waiter brought out our checks he told us that our desserts were also on the house. After 6 we began to hear live jazz music from the next room. We felt right at home here.  We knew this new restaurant was pricey but we came prepared for it since this was our special day. They do offer valet parking after 6 pm for $8.00. Otherwise, you can park in one of the downtown garages. Eddie V's is a welcome addition to our neighborhood and would highly recommend it if you want to celebrate something or have a night on the town."}
{"text":"Really nice atmosphere, food, and music but the service at the bar leaves much to be desired. I wanted so long for my food that it was \"comped\". I had to ask the male bartender for everything twice.   It pretty much ruined the experience for me."}
{"text":"Good , good and better.  I want to go back and try more of the food options..  The mojito made by the bartender was tasty. Happy hour pricing made it even better.  They were out of the $1 oysters so I tried the battered ones. Very good.  Presentation looked great on the food. It was very crowded."}
{"text":"Wow !!! This place exceeded my expectations. I had never been and a friend of mine suggested we try it out for Restaurant week , I'm so glad we went the service was 5 stars without the stuffy feel that you get in other high end places. The atmosphere is fun and relaxing with a live jazz band and sexy bar. The food was great my shrimp was good but I would highly recommend the Chilean Sea Bass (Hong kong style) that and the banana fosters dessert was what really stood out .the portions were perfect very generous on the fish. My friend got the steak and that was on the small side but we left satisfied and can't wait to go back again. Also there Cocktail list looked good."}
{"text":"We have been dining at Eddie V's since it left DC Ranch about 10years ago. It was my wife's Birthday  1/14? and as a tradition we all go to our favorite place. Unfortunately with BJackson in town we forgot to make reservations. I was glad to see Mr. Richard Schumacher up front greeting his guests. After a short while he was able to set us up at a table. We went on with the help of Omah to enjoy another great evening. 20 years in Scottsdale , this is a close to elegance, fine food and live entertainment that I have experienced since leaving Manhattan. I danced with my wife after enjoying there delicious Oysters and Martini's. I already made reservations for Saturday to impress my clients, can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"visiting in town we bar hopped to 10 happy hours for food as it was too hot to cook. Eddie V's ranked #2 out of the 10 we visited. By far, the best calamari appetizer of anywhere else we went in Scottsdale (and my husband ordered it at least 5 times - as one who lacks ability to explore different foods). Calamari was in an amazing sauce with nuts which I didn't think I'd like but I loved it . Portion size was unbelievable. The Tuna Tartare was cold/fresh but didn't care much for the blend of citris fruits with it; if they were oranges they were bitter. Kids enjoyed a shrimp appetizer and tacos - both perfect portions for them. Restaurant was annoyingly dark to a point that you had to use a flashlight to read the menu. No seats in the house for happy hour within 30 min after it started so appears to be popular spot for locals and tourists. In a plaza that enables nice stroll to shop afterwards. Real nice that this happy hour goes til 7; made mistake and confused it with Delmonicos - by the time we walked to other end of the plaza their happy hour was over by 6pm."}
{"text":"Food was excellent but I'm sure tired of these places where everything is a la carte.  Is it supposed to be classier to have a little piece of fish in the middle of a huge empty platter?  We were there in a party of 8:  We had 2 moderately priced bottles of chardonnay, 7 salads, 8 entrees, 4 sides.  No apps, no desserts.  Our bill was $690 before tip.  I suppose this is acceptable for those of you from the East Coast, but I would never pay that much twice.  I hear they have a weekday happy hour in the bar.  That is probably as far as I'd go."}
{"text":"Fantastic place.  Great food, drinks, and setting.  Had the filet and it was cooked perfectly.  Would absolutely recommend this place."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for Easter Brunch and were disappointed with the food and service.  They placed us at the table with an unlit lantern.  Every other table had a lit lantern.  Then the server was slow in getting my husband coffee.  They looked like they had enough servers.  I ordered lobster and the man who brought it out did not know how to get it off the tail properly so he shook it so much that the melter butter was all over the dish.  It was like lobster swimming in butter.  I just did not think this restaurant had a good attention to detail to call it fine dining.  The prices were high but the detail was off.  Yes it has nice artwork and the tables have white tablecloths.  But there is more to fine dining that those few things.  We wont be going back."}
{"text":"SO perfect I could cry. My boyfriend took me here for our anniversary dinner this month. It was absolutely spectacular. I cant describe how attentive the staff was and how good the food melted in your mouth. Double thumbs up"}
{"text":"My hubby and I always know we are going to enjoy a PERFECT dining experience at Eddie V's!  Consistent excellence is how I describe it.  Since we are return customers Eddie's always knows our favorite seating options where we can relax with a cocktail and scrumptious food to take in the happening vibe.  Everyone always looks happy @ Eddie V's.  We had Thea as a server-she anticipated our every need and paced our meal perfectly.  We often have Anna-and she came by our table to say hey-a nice touch as you know there are a gazillion customers she serves.  We always love Happy Hour in the Lounge-and often are entertained by great musicians.  Thanks for making us feel like part of your family!"}
{"text":"Been here multiple times and never a bad experience. Food is great and service is excellent."}
{"text":"What a meal!! My wife and I are spending a few days in Charlotte and stumbled upon Eddie V's. We are certainly glad we did! The professionalism of the staff was superb. The food was delicious and packed full of flavor and finesse. We started off with beautifully crafted cocktails, both delicious. Then had the shrimp cocktail with house-made dipping sauces. Be careful on the horseradish as it is amazingly powerful. Loved it though. My wife ordered the swordfish and throughly enjoyed it. I ordered the Parmesan Sole and couldn't be any happier with my choice. The roasted Brussel sprouts with shallots and bacon were a perfect addition to both meals. We finished with the Black berry cobbler with vanilla bean ice creme. Simply put, if you are wanting a fantastic meal with great service and attention to detail, Eddie V's will certainly deliver. Did I mention there was a live jazz band to accompany our meal?? Also, Marc was an exceptional waiter. I Would highly recommend him and this restaurant."}
{"text":"The venue is nice, romantic, dim-lit ambiance. Exceptional service as expected. The dinner options are pricey and the portions are small, but the food was very good. There is also live jazz at plays in the evening. A cool spot for a couple to check out for a romantic date."}
{"text":"OMG - I have to agree with a previous poster about this being officially \"the most pretentious place in Scottsdale\" - and that's saying alot in Scottsdale!!!  Some of the folks in there could pass for puppets or something, definately not human.  Not to mention the serious cougar and manther component!  However none of this can take away from the fact that this is a fabulous restaurant with great food and service.  We went on a Saturday during Happy Hour.  Since we had just come from iPic and were stuffed on popcorn, we decided to sit at the bar and have appetizers.  Service was impeccible and friendly.  I ordered my usual Hendrik's martini which was perfectly prepared, although not the same portion for the price youwould get at Mastro's.  My husband got an excellent strawberry mojito.  For apps we went with the crab cake and the pot stickers.  Crab cake was hands down the best I've ever eaten.  More crab than cake and hugh.  The potstickers were good too although the sauce was a bit too salty.  Other apps we saw go our were the calamari which looked great, the jumbo shorimp cocktail (the only thing that was jumbo in my estimation is the price.  $15 for 4 \"extra large\" at best shrimp), and the sushi rolls which looked OK but if you want sushi I'd go over to RA across the street.  Overall it was a very good experience and the clientele is entertaining.  I'll definately go back for a full meal on a special occasion."}
{"text":"Eddie V's may have just become my new favorite fine dining restaurant downtown. Incredible food, service, and atmosphere the entire evening. I made a reservation for a date night, and they went the extra mile by sprinkling rose petals on the table. The dim lighting and live band feature created a swanky and classy vibe to the restaurant which I loved.   Service was phenomenal. Everyone from our hostess to our waitresses were so friendly, helpful, and efficient. They have the dream team working here, that's for sure.   Now on to the most important part - the food! Though they're known for their steaks and seafood, this vegetarian opted for the Miso Marinated Tofu entree which was absolutely amazing! the dish is two blocks of tofu and vegetables in a miso sauce over a bed of rice. It's very light yet filling - definitely recommend! I also ordered a small side of the roasted beets which was enjoyable but nothing extraordinary. The small side dishes are meant to be shared between 2 people - clearly this did not apply for me. For dessert, we ordered the chocolate cake a la mode for dessert which was surprisingly disappointing. The cake was too under baked for my liking. If you enjoy raw cake batter, this might be for you, but I would pass otherwise. Luckily, they have plenty of other dessert options available which I may have to return to taste test.  Definitely do not miss out on Eddie V's! Highly recommend for any special occasion because dessert is on the house if you note it in your reservation."}
{"text":"Outstanding dinner! Sea Bass, crab fired rice, lobster Bisque and bananas foster flaming cake was over the top excellent. Great wine menu and friendly and prompt staff. We drove 40 minutes out of our way for the experience. This will now be a regular out of the way destination!"}
{"text":"A great seafood and steakhouse on par with the best in town. Hong Kong Sea Bass is amazing as was the NY Steak. Crab Fried Rice is a mist too. VERY disappointed that they took the Potstickers off the menu though. I was going to dock them a star for that alone but the rest of it, (including the service) was so good that I couldn't do it. To senior management, what are you thinking? That was the best thing on the menu."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Charlotte Eddie V's for the first time on Thursday.  Several of our friends went during the first week and said they had a terrible dining experience.  We thought we would wait and hopefully they would work out the kinks.  Nope.  We had a horrible experience.  Waited far too long for our cocktails.  Far too long for our appetizers and far too long for our entrees.  Forgot our sides as well.  How does THAT happen??!! We had the Osetra caviar and oysters for appetizers.  Couldn't really mess that up.  Entrees were just ok.  Can get a better steak elsewhere.  King crab was not great.  Service was disorganized.  You would think that since this is a chain, they would have a great training program.  We sat at the bar, like many friends suggested because they had bad dining room service.  No excuses about sitting at the bar to dine.  We sit at the bar at The Palm and Capitol Grille all the time.  No issues.  The poor man next to us was trying to get one of the 3 bartenders to look his way so he could pay his bill!  He waited over 10 minutes!  There was no way they didn't notice him waving his hands.  When we finally were acknowledged, I pointed out the man next to us trying to pay his tab.  Also, I ordered the duet champagne.  Poured my second champagne (different champagne) in the same glass and I still had champagne in it.   My husband waited almost 15 minutes for his bottle of wine.  Apparently, there was some confusion about where the bottle was....???! The bar had 4 empty seats.  So not super busy. We soooo wanted to love this new restaurant, but it was not at all a great experience.   Nothing stood out.  It's cool looking and nice to go somewhere with live music, but that's the only positive that we took away from our experience.  Except, we did make a friend while sitting at the bar because she was complaining too.  Not kidding.   We probably won't be back.  We have our tried and true restaurants.  This place was just a confusing hassle.  Really too bad."}
{"text":"I planned a special dinner here and gave them a heads up that we were coming from a helicopter tour and then heading straight to the restaurant so they would know our timeframe for arrival. We got there roughly on time for our reservation. Our server greeted us politely, said to my friend \"Happy Birthday! Did you enjoy your helicopter tour?\" I hadn't mentioned it all when we got there. That just goes to show how much attention to detail they paid to me as when I set the reservation days prior to that. I was very happy. The food was perfect, per usual. 5 stars, 5 stars, 5 stars."}
{"text":"My husband and I celebrated my birthday at Eddie V's...my favorite restaurant!!!!  The food and the service is PAR EXCELLENCE!!!!!  If you haven't dined here and are looking for a great evening, listening to a live band playing Smooooooth Jazz while you feast on some of FRESHEST delectable dishes in the nation....WHATCHA WAITIN FOR?  You don't know what you're missing...HURRY UP...Eddie V's will become your GO-TO for special occasions or Just Because ;-)  Bon Appetite!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, and perhaps best supper club I've been too and I'm from NYC! Feels like 1958....."}
{"text":"Spent Christmas Eve with my family at Eddie V's. The place was packed but every part of the staff made us feel as if we were the only ones there. Rocho our waiter was the best waiter I have ever had. Thank you for this experience."}
{"text":"Surprisingly, this place out here in the desert has fresher and better quality seafood than most and seafood joint in Ny or Philly, which I live between. We had a seafood tower, which was far better than Bobby Flays at the Borgata in AC. Fresh, sweet oysters, crab, and lobster in relatively large portions, with monster shrimp. All with no ammonia or chlorine taste and not one piece that was \"off\". The first time this side of Paris! And Maine lobster is significantly tastier than that served in Europe. An amazing evening. We also had the Chilean sea bass which was like butter and the soy sauce sauce it was in was surprisingly tasty and not too salty! The dessert was the blackberry cobbler which was steaming hot with vanilla ice cream. Good, but maybe I should have ordered another entree for dessert! The side of pea beans and portobello was great too. A good reason to fly to Phoenix, as far as I'm concerned."}
{"text":"The service is incredible 5 stars. Best service I've ever had.  They have a tasty calamari appetizer and a delicious Bananna fosters cake 4 stars  But the main entrees of scallops and the shrimp dish were both subpar. 2.5 stars.  Shrimp was overcooked and rubbery, dry, and no flavor. The scallop dish was just so so. For the high price I would expect the food to be memorable or match the high level of service, but it did not."}
{"text":"Same great ambiance and taste I grew to love in TysonsCorner! Extremely excited about the Charlotte location.   I ordered the crab bisque, crab stuffed shrimp and banana foster cake. The bisque was flavorful, rich and meaty. I spritzed s bit of lemon juice on the shrimp..my taste buds did a dance! Lastly, the bananas foster was decadent, buttery, crisp edges and it wasn't overtly sweet. Wonderful meal worth every cent!   This visit was made during happy hour. I noticed there were only older couples- no singles. Hopefully, a happy hours crowd of 30 plus age group begin to come out.  ** Ladies, please be aware the bathroom lighting is quite dim. Definitely not the place to adjust makeup. Please ensure you're perfect before leaving home!  I attached a bathroom selfie so you can get an idea.."}
{"text":"Good however OUTRAGEOUSLY expensive. Plan ahead before dining here unless money is no object.   I stopped here after work for a cocktail, appetizer, dinner and glass of wine that totaled $80 without a tip. I used to dine like this years ago but not anymore with the incredible selection of affordable restaurants of similar caliber. More expensive does not always mean better quality.  The service was friendly and timely. My server got my dinner order wrong but he was very nice and attentive.   I highly recommend you make a reservation this place is extremely busy and fills up fast."}
{"text":"A big fail.  Made reservations for two for our wedding anniversary, and the reservation team said they had our hour and \"any quarter hour\" before. We agreed on a time and she said \"no problem.\"  The problems began when we arrived. No table. 15 minutes later. Still no table. Another 15 minutes - half an hour after our reservation- and still no table. The two staff at the reservation table seem flummoxed.  People come in after us and are seated where we requested. They said they had a table. Another 10-12 minutes goes by. 45 minutes after our arrival. I told my husband we should go. Just as we got up, the waiter comes over to seat us. Food was good. Dinner service was good. After dinner, our server said \"are you celebrating anything?\" Yes, we are. I told the team 3 days ago.   No. No. No. Epic fail."}
{"text":"When I made our reservation, I jokingly added a note that my wife and I were celebrating our 16.5 wedding anniversary.  Eddie V's, though, took it seriously and pulled out all the stops - rose petals on our table, signed Happy Anniversary card, and free dessert.  I mentioned several times that it wasn't really our anniversary, but they would hear nothing about that!  LOVED IT!  We will be going back as often as we can!"}
{"text":"Great spot to grab a drink and some great food. Upscale casual crowd. Has a great happy hour, live jazz music. The bar area can get pretty busy."}
{"text":"Went here last night for my anniversary.  Had a reservation and let them know it was our anniversary.  Great vibe at the bar and wonderful live jazz.  Should have stayed there.  After a 10 minute wait?  We were seated downstairs in a back room?  The table did have a heart made of rose petals which was lovely!  And a card which was a very special touch.    Our server was very nice but did not have knowledge about the types of vodka they served? Hmm.  Our oysters were delicious, although 2 had shells in them.  Next up was table side made steak tartare.  Our sweet waiter mashed the heck out of it so much that it was tough when we ate it.  Had to ask for a clean knife ---shouldn't have to. Next up was a delicious lobster bisque but it had this weird mushy cake at the bottom that even the waiter said people hate it.  Finally the entrees---a dry swordfish and a way salty sea bass.  The sea bass was cooked to perfection but hard to eat because it was swimming in an overly reduced salt bath.  Our waiter did give us a dessert to go for our anniversary which was thoughtful.    We also did notice a waiter reset a table and double check the glasses with a flashlight.  That was nice.    Honestly I wanted to love this place and was so excited to come!  Sad it fell short in so many ways.  If I even go back I'll stay at the bar."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Eddie Vs for our 11th anniversary. The food and service were amazing and we were seated in a comfortable booth decorated with rose petals. My wife got a steak and wanted some scallops on the side. The scallops were so good she instantly ordered two more. I had the crab cake which was the best I've ever had. We were able to order whatever dessert we wanted for our anniversary and took our waiters suggestion to get the banana foster which was mind blowing. We've never had a more delicious dessert. We noticed that Eddie Vs also has live music which is huge for us. Next time we will sit in the lounge to get a better view of the musicians. We couldn't have asked for a more perfect way to celebrate our anniversary. This place is expensive but for a special occasion it's worth every penny."}
{"text":"Six thirty reservation on a Tuesday. The place was packed. Great service, great food w/a nice jazz band. Pricey.  Crab cakes were excellent and the double breast chicken was moist and tender.  The scallops were tasty but could have been seared a bit more (where's Chef Ramsey when you need him). Important note: the place is dark. So dark that customers were using their phone flashlight to read the menu; now that is just too dark.  Who are we hiding from in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Exceptional in every detail. I took my partner to Eddie V's for his birthday. When I booked the reservation on-line the site asked if it was a special occasion, so I checked the box for birthday. When we arrived we were seated at a large corner booth with an excellent view of the restaurant and the table was sprinkled with birthday glitter along with a card. Dessert was on the house for the birthday boy. Near us was a couple celebrating an anniversary with rose peddles on the table.  The food and service were as good as it gets! We shared a large crab cake and calamari for appetizers and had swordfish, scallops, & roasted beets for the main dish. All were cooked to perfection and creatively prepared. There is live music (not loud at all) and a relaxing beautiful bar area next to the main dining area separated by a glass wall. This is an excellent place for happy hour or to hang out before or after dinner.  It was a Monday night and there were several tables of businessmen. The restaurant sits below street level and the ambiance is formal with white tablecloths, however it feels modern and you can see the immaculate kitchen behind glass. I don't think they have anything to hide. Our bill with a $43 dollar bottle of wine was $175 before the tip, I expect the average bill is higher. Portions are generous and side dishes are meant to be shared. The prices are justified for such an exceptional restaurant. It's a exceptional addition to Pittsburgh's greatly improving fine dining scene."}
{"text":"Came here for an early V-Day dinner and would definitely come again.  We were there in time for the happy hour, so I ordered 1/2 dozen of oysters.  My husband had the shrimp cocktail which were big and yummy.  He also ordered the lobster bisque and he thought it was too cold.  I thought it was fine though.  We shared the fuji apple salad - delicious.  I probably should have stopped there as I was getting full!  I did order the parmesan lemon sole and although I ate like 3 bites, it was to die for!  My husband ordered the filet and liked it, but not loved. He doesn't stray too far out of the box, so it has to be cooked perfectly for him to absolutely love a dish.  Service was great and the entertainment.  I just gave them 4 stars due to the inconsistency of my husband's plates, but would try them again."}
{"text":"My wife and I happened on Eddie's when we were walking back from the Old Town Art Walk. We had already had dinner, but we had a chance to chat with Eddie and the hostess that night, so we decided to come back with friends that Saturday evening.  We had a very memorable meal. Eddie and the staff clearly remembered us and sat us (a group of 6) at a central table. My wife and I each had  the \"Mrs. Weiss''\" Grilled Salmon (named after his mother-in-law) and it was moist and delicious. One of our friends and his son split a huge bone-in-ribeye that was cooked to perfection. The other steak and seafood options looked enticing. The house treated us to a large order of Mussels and we had such a wonderful evening that we forgot to leave and had to be coaxed out after a couple of hours since people were waiting to be seated. The staff was attentive and helpful. This is at the top of our list for our next trip to Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Best steak in town!!! Food is amazing, service is great and atmosphere is nice. They also have the best band playing, especially when they have the saxophonist! Five plus stars!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour. Love their appetizers and soups. After we order some apps and soup we are usually too full for entrees but it's so worth it!"}
{"text":"Eddie V's is a hidden gem! My coworkers and I decided to come here for RW with a last minute reservation. We called the day of and surprisingly got offered seats at the bar which we happily took. This night ended up being particularly cold and snowy so luckily for us, that meant that there were lots of cancellations. We noticed a lot of empty tables when we arrived, and when we asked, they kindly offered us one.   I started off with the lobster bisque which came with a teeny chunk of lobster and a larger round of bread. This way okay. It would have been awesome if the sizes of the proportions flipped around, but I'm sure that would never happen.  For my entree, I got the salmon and I kid you not when I say it was some of the best salmon I've had. The salmon filet was so soft and flaked right apart when I picked it up with my fork. It came accompanied with baby potatoes, corn, tomatoes, and brussel sprouts which were all seasoned just the right amount.   For dessert I got the banana flambé which was lit on fire right in front of me. It came with sliced bananas on top and butter pecan ice cream which was delicious paired with the hot banana cake. Imagine a nice hot and cold combo in your mouth. In the end it was a bit too sweet for me, but still so good.   The service was impeccable. Our waiter was awesome - when we tried to hand him our finished plates, he commented that the only time we needed to pick up a finger is to enjoy our food. Thought that was sweet. The ambiance here was on point too. I absolutely loved the live piano playing towards the back.   Would highly recommend this place for a nice dinner!"}
{"text":"We're from Fort Myers, Florida. We had Thanksgiving dinner at Eddie V's. It was excellent. Best Thanksgiving dinner I've eaten at a restaurant. In addition the service was excellent."}
{"text":"Maybe even a 5.  We had the seafood tower which was priced in the area between $65 and $70.  That may sound like a lot for an appetizer, but it had 8 oysters, 8 shrimp, a bunch of lump crab and about a 1 1/2 pound lobster.  For that much stuff...heck of a value.  Not that we had a lot of room left over, but we ordered more.  12 oz filet...very good, although it had to go back to the kitchen twice to get it cooked to my order.  Brussel sprouts...a little bitter but still good.  Crab fired rice...OMFG!!!  Real good.  Had the butter cake foster.  Very good, but I could have done without the 151 flambe.  Notwithstanding my minor issues above, still very good overall.  Pricey place to eat but overall worth it.  FWIW, the music wasn't a pain in the ass this time."}
{"text":"Fresh oysters, good steaks, and a great selection on the dinner menu for the steak and potatoes crowd, the seafood lovers, and a wine list to partner with your selection.  Very good portions to share with friends or your significant other, and the plating is what you should come to expect from a dimly lit, jazzy steak and seafood venue.  A Monday night reservation for our group of 6 was easy to obtain and the service was top notch from the staff.  While we were seated by the kitchen, the noise level was still very low that our entire group was able to have a great conversation without the usual kitchen noise distractions.  I'd recommend and myself would come back the next time I am around the North Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"Eddie V's be Prime Seafood Made reservations through Open Table for the Friday before Mother's Day at 8:00 pm. Unbelievable how busy it was as we walked in.  Waited at the entry for about 10 minutes as we waited by the V Lounge with great live music.  The atmosphere is very nice with low lighting to add to your experience.   We started off with the Point Judith Calamari which was prepared in a Kung Pao Style with Roasted Cashews and Crisp Noodles. We had the sauce on the side to ensure we did not get our mouth flamed out. Portion was pretty good to share and not too hot.  We ordered the Chilean Seabass which was steamed in a Hong Kong Style Light Soy Broth which was so tender that it just melted in your mouth. This was a nice choice and would recommend.  We also ordered the 34 oz Porterhouse Steak that we shared, that was a monster of a steak and my son and I could not finish. This dish was also a winner being so tender and prepared as requested.   The last entree was the Bay of Fundy Salmon which was sautéed with Young Vegetables and Maille Mustard Vinaigrette which was also a wonderful dish.  We shared 2 sides, the Broccolini with Lemon and Garlic and the Parmesan and Chive French Fries which were both okay, would prefer to order others next time.  For dessert we had their signature dessert which was the Hot Bananas Foster Butter Cake which was a show and a delite by itself. Our waiter, Brenon, lit the container and then poured the flaming sauce over the butter cake. I have to say if both of my kids are video taping the flaming dessert they were impressed by the presentation. The taste did not disappoint, if you eat here you have to order this dessert. One of the best desserts we have ever had.  Have to say the service was excellent and our waiter Brenon was on top of everything with his recommendations and taking care of us.  What a great experience and meal, would highly recommend and definitely would come back again."}
{"text":"Great service, the bananas foster was delicious, but the main course meal was just ok for the price.  I ordered the Sea Bass Hong King style and it was good, not great.  My friend ordered the Jumbo Shrimp and it was just ok.  We also tried the crab fried rice and we were disappointed with it.  If we went back it would be to have a glass of wine and dessert."}
{"text":"Owned by The Capital Grille we were slightly disappointed the quality of food and service wasn't up to the level.  The brussel sprouts were severely underdone and servings were overstated. I did not find the service that night to be anything wonderful.  A male server too interested in \"over serving\" the table behind us and a female server \"under serving\" the family table in front of us.  These two should meet in the middle and take care of \"Customer\" service.   The steak was good but nothing I'd get excited about.  Especially having to send it back twice for the proper temperature.  Not sure I'd give it another go at these prices.  Everything orders \"a la carte\" which is ok IF you do it right the first time."}
{"text":"I was really excited to come back here the 2nd time to celebrate my anniversary with my boyfriend and a group of our friends. The table setting was beautifully done with rose petals so I was already walking in happy.   The fact that they put us next to that storage wall of wine was pretty cool just because I thought that was a neat display of \"art\".  Aside from the amazing food (again) what made this from a 5 star to a 1 star was the fact that my server screwed up my order and charged me for it.  I had told the server that I wanted the \"large\" truffle mac and cheese since I was craving for that for a long time. Sadly to say, my server gave us a small. I tried to get his attention but my server was no where to be found on the floor, I just decided \"screw it\" I'll just eat the small. When we finally got the server's attention, I had asked about our order if he had wrote it up as a large or small just to make sure he didn't charge us for a large when he gave us a small; he told me because my other party members had also order the mac & cheese, he figure he change my large to a small since there would be to many mac & cheese (WTF??). Somehow there was a confusing somewhere (don't know how, the restaurant wasn't loud) but he took the rest of my small mac and cheese dish and brought a large. Towards the end, our bill had both mac & cheese. At least give me the rest of my small portion back. WTF???? LAME!!! Don't think I'll be dining here again after this experience."}
{"text":"Eddie freaking V. Pleased to make your acquaintance. I had seen my Houston buddies take many a Snapchat video of crab fried rice and other mouth watering entrees available here. When I saw the Charlotte Agenda article on restaurants soon to open locally, I was giddy with excitement. I vowed months ago, I would be here on opening night.  Actually, I made it in the day after, but it surpassed my expectations. Our server, Daniel (or David, sorry it was Cinco de Mayo, so I arrived with Patron margaritas flowing in my veins) was on point all evening. Patient, helpful, funny....I can't compliment him enough. We had mac & Cheese, lobster bisque (poured table side!), crab fried rice, lobster tacos, crab cakes, and dessert. The only item I would pass on was the crab cakes and that's only because I prefer it without the breading. But we ate every single bite, so if that doesn't bother you, Order away. The lobster bisque and crab fried rice will be something I will always order on subsequent trips.   The decor is perfect for the area. It's dark and swanky, but still well lit enough to see around. Any date you bring here will be impressed, I know I certainly was."}
