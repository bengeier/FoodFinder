{"text":"Ordered delivery tonight and it came pretty quickly and was nice and hot. With the large pep I got they included garlic and ranch dipping sauces which is always a plus. The pizza itself was really good too! Nice yeasty dough and a flavorful sauce. I hope more people give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Found a menu in the lobby and somehow convinced my coworkers that we should try this place out.  After looking over the menu and selected what we all wanted, we had our orders in.    The menu is the norm for what you will find when it comes to a pizza based establishment.  Pizza, subs, calzones, salads, appetizers, etc.  I had opted for a salad.  The salad base is a mixed green.  Then add in some halved grape tomatoes, red onion slices, and cucumbers.  And in traditional Pittsburgh salad top it with french fries and some cheese that seems to melt over it all encasing it in flavor.  Why is it that french fries on a salad taste so damned good?  Most of the salads on the menu you will have a choice of meat toppings.  I went with the popcorn chicken for mine.  Delivery was swift, we had our order in less than a hour.  Appears there might be a dollar delivery fee, which is way less than most places in the city.  Definitely will give this place another try in the future and venture further into the menu."}
{"text":"The Sicilian pizza tasted clean and I could appreciate the freshness and quality of the assortment of cheeses, but the lack of sauce makes this pie taste kind of like a breadstick. The amount of sauce is considerably below average compared to most pizzas. However, I'll likely order again and either order extra sauce or marinara on the side. If it had more sauce, it would be great instead of good.  The homemade potato fries are cut like potato chips and come with buffalo cheese sauce - super delicious!!! I'd have rated 4 stars if the pizza had more sauce."}
{"text":"Awesome place, pizza has incredible flavor and the crust is legit. Got the King Kong and was not dissapointed at all, couldn't even fit the pizza through the doorway! It was all tasty and glorious."}
