{"text":"We used to be regular customers of Carp Pizza, however, every time we would order delivery there would be something wrong with the order. Either the food was bad quality (burnt chicken, stale burger buns, soggy fish) or the food delivered was not what we ordered.  After giving Carp Pizza numerous chances, I decided to finally call and let them know I was extremely dissatisfied with their service and quality after receiving the wrong order and poor quality food. The guy who spoke to me basically made me feel as though I was in the wrong for making a complaint. He did offer a discount on the next order (but honestly - as if we were going to order again!) but his demeanor wreaked of smug, poor attitude and he made me feel as though I had no right to call and complain about a service I had paid for.  Well, they have now lost a customer who ordered VERY regularly and I will be ensuring they lose the business of all neighbours and friends as well.  Time to take some pride in the food you serve and the service you provide! Carp Pizza staff need a lesson or 2 in hospitality. Disappointed to say the least."}

{"text":"I was curious to try this place out since there aren't many pizza places in Carp; it is a very small store, but a lot of the workers have been there for years.  I chose the pizza lover's dream, which was double pepperoni, double cheese, and double bacon strips.   The taste was good, but I thought that there could be more toppings. The curst is a bit tougher than what I prefer, but overall it was pretty average."}
