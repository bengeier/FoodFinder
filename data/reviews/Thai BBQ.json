{"text":"One of my favorite lunch spot whenever I'm craving for some Thai Iced Tea and Thai BBQ chicken.  Restaurant size is quaint but staff is friendly, price is cheap, and food is scrumptious.  Highly recommended for casual lunch!"}
{"text":"Yes this place looks scary, inside and out. But it has the best Thai food in Vegas. Their chicken curry is worth driving across town for. Their tom yum Kung is on point. Their beef skewers with peanut sauce will keep you coming back. The BBQ chicken and fried rice is really good as well. Service is normally subpar, but my family has been going here for years and they remember us."}
{"text":"Unlimited free refills on Thai Iced Tea! Did I get your attention? If you are an avid fan of this beverage that is perhaps the one and only compelling reason to visit this little hole-in-the-wall. The inside is dark, and the carpet is dingy. The bathroom... well you get the picture.

While the food is decent, it can't compete with the better restaurants. Their Pad Thai and Pad See-Ew are only okay. They do have a tasty Garlic Short Rib lunch special and a nice Honey Duck dish that you don't often see at other Thai places.

The service is usually warm and eager to please but a bit slow at times. After three or four refills of Thai Iced Tea, the waitress even asked if I wanted a refill to go! Already feeling guilty about my excessive caloric intake, I politely declined. If only there was a diet version..."}
{"text":"Free refills on Thai Ice Tea!!! The house specials are good and the Pad Thai is pretty good. I usually don't come here for Authentic Thai food but I'll hit this place up for some Beef Satay."}
{"text":"My favorite thai place and ive been into many thai places. Thai bbq takes 1st place!! Been going here for years."}
{"text":"My god... the chicken dinner is awesome.  I completely love this place. 
 Have not had a bad meal or a bad experience.  
Try anything on the menu. All is awesome."}
{"text":"Ladies and gentlemen
I am 100% sure that this is not an AUTHENTIC \"THAI BBQ\"
Please do not be fooled, just because they have the sign that looks like the chain from LA, rest assured folks, the quality control staff of THAI BBQ have nothing to do with this restaurant.
I have eaten their food and it is obvious these people have nothing to do with chain.
Just and imposter without its own identity.
You have been warned."}
{"text":"Me and the wife are definitely regulars here now and big fans.  First things first the parking lot is pretty small but I've never had problem finding parking and the decor is a little bit dated hence the 4 stars, but whenever me and the wife go out two eat it's always the food and service we judge first and the decor a very distant second... or is that third?... oh well.  Hey if our table is clean when we set down, our utensils and plate you serve our food in is clean?  I'm good. 

Ever since we left Orange County a few months ago I've been looking for the closest panang curry I could find to what Thai Nakorn served.  This place is the only one so far that has come close!  I'm not a big fan of Thai iced teas, but my wife is and she think their version is great and you get free re-fills too!"}
{"text":"I've only had the food because it's down the street from work and one of my boss's favorite places to treat us to. 

Decent place for a take-away lunchtime snack. We always get the chicken satay and shrimp fried rice. I haven't had anything else there. The food is a little greasy but big on flavor. 

I wouldn't choose this place outside of my work day, but definitely worth a stop by if you're in the neighborhood. The menu is reasonably priced, food comes quickly, and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"This place is close to home the food is decent.. Price is good but there is better Thai restaurants in this city"}
{"text":"I just ordered for take out last night. It was so good. I order S-1 Chicken BBQ and S-8 Beef Sate dinner. The chicken was juicy, it was still juicy even the day after when I was eating my left overs. The Beef Sate came with 6 stick, it was delicious. I hope they cater  because I want to order for Christmas Eve. I love Thai BBQ."}
{"text":"Their food is delicious ! Always fresh , and service is quick and friendly. I ordered pad kee mow , asked the waitress if they had it since I didn't see it on the menu , and she said they do have it ... I was skeptical at first , as I've had gross pad kee mow before . But it was the best I've tasted in Las Vegas ! Very happy. Will be going back"}
{"text":"I order the Thai Chicken BBQ plate and pineapple fried rice.  I am so disappointed at this place.  My Thai BBQ came like it was fried then it was placed on the grill for a little while, then they added some BBQ sauce, reminds me of cafeteria chicken, just worse. There was no grille taste to it. I never BBQed before, but I think I can make a better BBQ chicken then that.  The BBQ chicken came with fried rice. Wait till you read the next part. My pineapple fried rice, it was a reuse of the rice from that came with the BBQ chicken.  Fried rice was basically prepared, they threw in the pineapple, boiled some chicken, mixed it in with the rice.  Then boiled some shrimp and placed it on top of my fried rice. I felt like I was eating the same place from the BBQ chicken. What an experience!  I would not go back there there again.  I had a groupon that I though was supposed to work there.  But it turns out that it is for another location. This place is a total disappointment. I rather eat cafeteria food than this!"}
{"text":"Absolutly amazzzzzing been going here since i was 7 yrs old! Now im 21 employees are very nice. Especially the owners! No other thai place can beat this location!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here with about 10 people hungover and food has never tasted so good. I got the Pad-See-Ew with beef (extra spicy) and it was AMAZING. Perfect amount of broccoli and beef. Perfect amount of red pepper flakes. Great portion size (took half home). About to go eat my leftovers  mmm"}
{"text":"The chicken saute is awesome! My boyfriend had the garlic beef and he was very pleased with it! Will return in the future!"}
{"text":"Chicken fried rice was amazing. I tried the ribs for the first time and was not very excited. I prefer korean bbq. But the shrimp dish and chicken friend rice was on point. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. Although the location was not the best and weird people stood around the car and I had to manuver to get around them."}
{"text":"Absolutely yummy! Favorite dish by far is the beef sa-te. Service is quick and the food comes out pretty fast too. Highly recommend this place if you love that food."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai restaurant in Las Vegas.  We live in LA and we come here every time in Vegas"}
{"text":"Stop thinking... close your eyes and get here fast.  It is the best Thai food you will ever have period.  

We are from Los Angeles and stumbled upon this Thai restaurant on our way to visiting the Las Vegas strip.  The location  is homey, a bit dark and nothing to brag about.  So if you are looking  for atmosphere , this won't do it for you but the food was best Thai food I have ever tasted in over 30 years!  

Heck I might consider moving to Vegas just for this food :))

My hat's off to the chef.   Awesome is all I can say."}
{"text":"Thai bbq is delicious is my to go to place for their spicy coconut soup,Sate,and curry YUMMERZ it has never dissapoint me."}
{"text":"When I first moved here from LA many moons ago I thought I would miss Thai BBQ off 3rd in downtown LA. Luckily, they opened one out here and Ive been very happy. 

Every time I go here I wonder how they keep earning that A since the place looks like it can use a serious makeover and thorough cleaning. As I have gotten older I have come to expect restaurants to be cleaner and more refined which this place is not. It reminds me of an old greasy spoon I used to visit in Queens, NY. 

With that said, I come for the food and the service. I have probably eaten here over 100 times in the last 15 years or so and I can honestly say I have never had a bad meal. Their Phad Thai is on par with Archie's and the Spicy beef salad is excellent. Their prices are also very affordable. 

Just yesterday I had their Chicken Chow Mein and steamed rice which was very good and just at $10 is very reasonable IMO."}
{"text":"I ordered shrimp pad thai and thai tea as a pick-up order. They told me it was will be 25 mins until it will be ready. My husband stopped by to pick up the order and they didn't have my order. I don't know if there was some kind of miscommunication somewhere or if they gave the order to someone else. So they tell him to wait 5 minutes and they will make it. The pad thai tasted okay but there wasn't much there. They did give us a 2nd thai tea for free for messing up the order and those were pretty good. I don't think I'll be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"It's always amazing.  If it's your first time my boyfriend says to try the beef salad (I don't eat red meat lol).  A couple other favorites are the chicken satay, chicken dinner and shrimp pad thai.  Really surprised this place doesn't have 5 stars on Yelp."}
{"text":"It's kind of a greasy spoon but i've been going here for 14 years now.  Their bbq chicken is great with the honey sauce on the rice.  They have good short ribs as well but I have to be honest, I get the same thing every time!  The service is great.  They always remember me and are prompt and polite.  The prices are good, a full half chicken dinner is $9.95... barely more than today's fast food joints.  Stop in and give it a try, and wear your jeans and flip flops... it's casual."}
{"text":"Love, love, love the thai beef salad... Shrimp fried rice, amazing... And they don't get skimpy on the shrimp or the size of the shrimp! And unlimited refills of thai tea... When the quality is there... The distance doesn't matter(come all the way from hendo)"}
{"text":"I have tried dozens of Thai places, even other Thai BBQ locations, and this one is the one for me.  My Goldilocks spot.  I love the soups.  The chicken sate knocks my socks off.  These are the same owners of Panna Thai which is by my home, but I still drive down here.  Panna Thai is a more upscale offering (and good too).  
This is not Thai like being in Thailand, no.  This is Thai for being in America.
Plenty of seating. Speedy service.  Call ahead and take-out is very convenient and super fast -as it should be."}
{"text":"Just got my order delivered from Roadrunner foods. I was very disappointed with Thai BBQ. Chicken was extremely dry, shrimp chow mein was mediocre at best, and the pork larb salad so so. The fact that the larb salad was spilled all over the place didn't help either."}
{"text":"Service was excellent...waitress made sure our cups were always full with water...food was awesome...had the pad thai with pork egg rolls ....would have given a 5 star if there was wifi included....overall it was a good experience and will be going back"}
{"text":"Lunch specials are great. they have this peanut sauce the offer with there beef satay ... oh so good. And the cucumber salad is really good but whatch out it's loaded with jalepenos."}
{"text":"I used to eat regularly at their branch in LA and have been a fan of BBQ ribs and Java rice so I told  my friends to try their food.

First time to eat on this branch and was very dissapointed. OMG I was so embarassed when I saw the food that we ordered. We  bought S1 and S2 , BBQ ribs and chicken , Panang beef curry to go and received the worst quality of food. Chicken and  ribs were undercooked and not even grilled, Java rice was sticky , brown in color,  tasted looked  like leftover, beef meat from the Panang Beef curry looked absolutely gross, No pickled cucumber, sauce was not the regular red orange color but pink...then after eating some of the food, all of us got bloated and felt nauseated. Do not go to this branch!!"}
{"text":"I am a frequent diner here at this specific location. I've tried other locations and they are not created equally. I come here for their awesome lunch menu. The beef sate, BBQ chicken, chicken curry, and ribs are my favorite. All the flavors are blended well, are well-sized portions, and come with delicious fried rice to complement each meal. Chicken curry comes with steam rice, but you can request the fried rice. Shrimp Pad Thai is a must-order for me when I am here. However, sometimes I've gotten the Pad Thai dry and bland. They must have had a different cook that day. Thai ice tea is also delicious and not too sweet. Dining area is small but clean. Staff is always friendly and efficient. I always take my friends and families when they are in town and Thai Original BBQ (here at Flamingo/Jones) never fails me!"}
{"text":"My friend told me about this place and their food is DELISh. Personal fav is beef satay and papaya salad. I recall going here before and the beef was tender and when we came back, it is a little bit chewy but still taste good. I got free Thai tea coz I check in on Yelp. Service is great too but one of the waiter is seems like she doesn't like working there good thing the one serving us was the opposite. She was really attentive and kept on checking on us. Excellent service! The place is outdated but if they get this place renovated and expand or maybe just fix their interior then people would go out of their way to go to this place coz their food is good as it is."}
{"text":"If your looking for a quaint place with great service and great food, and great pricing, this is your place! We have been coming to this place for many years and they never disappoint. And being in business for over 17 years, they have stood the test of time. That says a lot about a place."}
{"text":"Have been coming here and to this location for years! Employees are all so friendly, food is always delicious. Refills on thai tea from what i can remember! We refuse to go to any other location."}
{"text":"I love this place. One of the best Thai place. Not super aesthetic but good is great!"}
{"text":"We have eaten at alot of Thai restaurants in Las Vegas.  We are really impressed with this one!
The egg rolls were outstanding and the Drunken noodles we highly recommend.
The service was Great and they even refill your Thai iced tea for free.
This is now our favorite Thai restaurant in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for the last 12 years and their service has never failed me. Their BBQ chicken and fried rice are my children's favorite meal to order there. They have the most well mannered staff that produce such salivating food. Every time I visit, they always give me perfectly cooked chicken and fried rice is just divine. I highly recommend anyone to go if you want quick good service and high quality food!"}
{"text":"Fast, tasty, and inexpensive.  I get the beef satay and Thai iced tea. This is the ONLY place I know of that gives free refills on Thai iced tea!  They come around with pitchers of it like it's water."}
{"text":"This is one of the local restaurants that has good food.  I ordered the beef salad & crab fried rice.  Thai iced tea and chicken dinner, and angel wings for the four of us. The restaurant is very run down and if you look past it's cosmetic flaws the food keeps people like myself keep coming back.  I've been going to this place for almost 10 years."}
{"text":"Best Tai this side of Bangcock! Beef satay is like candy, pad tai is perfect. Service impeccable!"}
{"text":"When I'm feeling under the weather, all I want is spicy Thai food. Thankfully, Thai BBQ delivers- literally. I don't even have to leave my house to get my culinary cure on. Google the latest Eat24 discount code for a couple bucks off and you'll be eating within an hour.

The menu is huge, but you can't go wrong with the chicken tom kha soup- I get it extra spicy and it clears up all my congestion and the flavors are comforting. Love how this is one of the few versions in the city that isn't packed with scraps of lemongrass and chunks of ginger I have to keep picking out.

The lunch specials (also available for delivery) are under $10, generously portioned, and way better than the usual standard specials- think steamed ginger fish, grilled salmon tamarind, and garlic short ribs. My guy always goes for the crab fried rice though, because it's consistently good."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai restaurant!!! My family & I have been coming here for over 10 years. The food is always good & served hot & quickly. We always order family style so it's huge portions that we just share. This is one of the only Thai restaurants that gives refills on Thai tea."}
{"text":"It might seem like a hole in the wall but this hole in the wall is worth making a stop at! The staff is very nice for starters. We ordered crab rangoon that were delicious. Dinner hit the table, we ordered their S-1 Half Chicken dinner with shrimp fried rice.  Highly recommend this dish! I'm pretty sure with this little spot you can't go wrong. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Love the Thai BBQ Chicken dinner ! And their fried rice is the best. Big portions too."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Seems to be pretty inconsistent with quality and the prices are good. We usually stick to currys as they never disappoint, but we did get the phad thai once and it was okay. Not sure why people are saying the portion sizes are small - we always leave completely stuffed full."}
{"text":"1 star because I just got done eating here and had to Yelp about everything. 

As we were seated and about to order our server was rude. I ordered a hot tea and she misunderstood me and gave me Thai tea. I told her it was ok and that I would pay for her mistake and would drink it but also to bring me a hot tea. I'm a pescatarian and had questions about the coconut soup. She seemed to grow impatient with me so I just ordered a salad. 
Their food isn't anything special. 

As we were ready to leave, I didn't finish my Thai tea and wanted to get the rest to go to finish later. But no the server refused and I asked when did this rule start? I've eaten here many of times and got the rest of my drink to go and never had an issue. But tonight, oh god she told me \"I don't think so, it is our policy\". Wow unless she made it up on the spot their rules need to be more consistent with every server. Such a disappointment. I work at a restaurant and never had To tell my costumer no, you can't take the drink YOU paid for to go. You just have to chug the rest of it before you leave....Ridiculous. We are paying for it. And I didn't even order it in the first place."}
{"text":"The food is okay.if it was exceptional they could punk me out like they JUST did. I came in at 10:20 and they close at 11. They told me take out only. It's not like I came in at 10:55, which is morally a dick move, but due to my glycemic levels not being satisfied I'm force to write a bad review."}
{"text":"I wish I can eat here with my eyes blindfolded. I went here for the first time for an early Sunday evening dinner because I am craving their chicken bbq. Unlike the Los Angeles branch, I kinda have to force myself to be welcomed by the surrounding. The location is strangely ominous; it sits between a smoke shop blaring loud music and an unassuming local bar joint. The interior is nothing short of being appealing, instead of the lively glowing aquarium that LA has,  this Las Vegas branch spells drabness the moment one is ushered in inside i.e. drab lighting, drab decors... and if not for the attentive service, it may have been an altogether drab experience. As I said the real star of the show is the food, generous portion minus the cucumber and orange slice that LA has, and a free Thai iced tea courtesy of Yelp check-in."}
{"text":"Aloha bugah is Ono come by dis place baggahis broke the mouth... kanak attak #1 Thai place to gridz worker here get choke love"}
{"text":"Blah blah health and safety... Great spot, always get the beef saute with a Thai tea.  Yellow curry is good also,  Andy is the man!!!  Never had any problems with the food or the service. Hope they re-open soon!!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years love the food and atmosphere. Servers are great food is delicious. Only one problem they changed the barbeque beef salad which was my favorite. Very disappointing but I still love everything else on the menu especially the beef sate and the pork spare ribs"}
{"text":"A friend brought me here for lunch - my first impression upon seeing it was \"here I will get food poisoning\" .  The place is nothing fancy and can use a little sprucing up but when I got inside I saw many people eating there so I figured it had to be good - It was better then good - it was the best pepper steak I have ever had!!! I will be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Monster Shrimp Appetizer:
A huge salad, with a spicy sweet liquid dressing! So good me and my fiance were trying to pick out the ingredients so we could make it at home! A generous heap of shrimp, and a nice touch of cilantro. A delicious filling lunch or perfect to share as an appetizer.

Pork Thai Jerkey:
Crisp & dry. Obviously jerky like- This wasn't my favorite, but it came with a stellar sauce! See my pictures, it looks exactly how it tastes. Overall, better than most traditional jerky, with that Bbq Thai twist.

For my entree, I enjoyed the shrimp in oyster sauce medium spicy (spiciness coming from strips of green chili). It was good, not an overwhelming portion, which I appreciated. The onions and mushrooms were soft and seasoned nicely as well. 

My fiance ordered their BBQ beef on skewers with a side of fried rice, a cucumber salad, and a peanut dressing which he wasn't too fond of. I liked it a bit more than he did, but something was off there.

The service was excellent and attentive; we had about 4 refills of the Thai Ice Tea which was amazing. Ask for some wet naps if you need them, we both got a bit sticky :)

We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is more of a spot frequented by locals. It's always packed during lunchtime with families and coworkers out for lunch from work. 

The food is probably a little bit better than the yelp rating suggests. I've tried two things here so far: the chicken fried rice and the pepper steak lunch special. The fried rice was decent in terms of flavor with a great amount of volume. The pepper steak was pretty good, but lacking in portion size though it did come with a salad. If I were to come back, I'd avoid the lunch specials since they do not come with as satisfying of a portion size as the entrees.

Best tip ever right here: Get the Thai Iced Tea for sure (comes with free refills and is delicious)."}
{"text":"this place is yummy and the lunch specials are decent. If you need a thai food fix and are in the area (especially during lunch special hours) This place will hit the spot and is easy on the wallet."}
{"text":"Everything I visit Vegas, I must make a point to drop by here for some bomb @ss Thai Food and refillable Thai Tea! 

The building itself isn't appealing but once you enter the single door, you're immediately hit with the smell of goodness. 

I love their Pad Thai Noodles as well as their chicken skewers. The cucumber salad is a must! 

Service is always on point and the food never disappoints. 

If you can get past the flaws of older paint and furniture, you'll come to the realization that this is definitely a diamond in the rough.

Give this place a try when you're in the area. You can thank me later!"}
{"text":"Love this place I go when ever I can and I order when ever I can... It is my favorite spot and I love Thai food. Went there my first time in 2005 with my best friend Jimmy. And I have been going there since than. I took my ex wife there too now it will be mine and my soon to be new wife favorite spot..."}
{"text":"this place was delicious & reasonably priced. I got a sa-te dinner with 6 skewers + fried rice for around 12 bucks . The staff was really nice & accommodating. Definitely going to come back and try out some more items on the menu"}
{"text":"Tuesday i had lunch @ The Thai BBQ RESTAURANT. It was very good n service was prompt. I will recommend to friends and family."}
{"text":"They have really good food for the price. No other thai restaurants give free refills in Thai tea either so that's a plus! The lunch specials during the week is amazing price for the food. They're also the only ones that have steak sa-te, everywhere is chicken. We haven't ordered anything that has disappointed us yet."}
{"text":"Great place to get Thai food To Go...  Take it back to your room on the strip...  Tom Yum Koong is great!!!

Stewart James"}
{"text":"Don't go here, your credit card info could be stolen and used for online purchases!!!

I went for lunch with a co-worker and forgot to take my credit card back after signing the receipt. The next day I realized I had left it at the restaurant, called them and was told they still had it. However,  the following week I received a notice from my credit card company saying that it had been used to charge $600 worth of merchandise from Victoria's Secret. 

I didn't give the card to any merchants over the weekend, so it appears that the likely culprit is at Thai BBQ! It seems odd that they would use the card, while also keeping it for me, but who knows - people do crazy things! 

(The food itself was decent, nothing to complain about.)"}
{"text":"I've been going to this location since 1998!  There are many Thai BBQ in the valley but this is the only one I go to! 

It's a hole in the wall type of place but the food here is great! 

Once you step in you know this establishment has been here for quite sometime.  It has old style booths, the wall paper is old, and the chairs are damaged. 

The staff has always been kind to me through out the years and have always served me well.  Refilling my water, soda, and Thai tea.  Speaking of Thai Tea this place serves bottomless Thai Tea!!! Wow!!! Drink all the Thai Tea you want!!! It's also one of the best tasting Thai Tea in the valley.

As I said, their food is good and they have daily lunch specials.  I don't know what the red sauce is for their BBQ chicken and spare ribs but that sauce is the bomb! It's like crack! Lol"}
{"text":"Added an extra $10 on to my bill for no reason! Make sure to double check your bill. Overall, okay food, nothing special. Sticking to my usual place."}
{"text":"One of our favorite go to lunch places. Nearby for a lazy Saturday. Service is great. They make the best Thai iced tea. Portions are good, and wait staff are friendly."}
{"text":"I thought I would give this place another try and it's still disappointing. Service was starting off very well, until I informed them of the broken piece of glass I bit inside their sticky rice. They stopped making eye contact and coming around the table. 

Ordered-
Papaya Salad- they used bottled lemon juice which is wierd. Left a bad taste.
Chicken BBQ- 4 pieces of dried up chicken and you can tell the chicken was precooked and old.
Pork Rib BBQ dinner- fried rice was sweeter than usual and the ribs again was precooked, you will know by the way the bones are bone dry.
Tom Ka Gai- flavor was good but the chicken was slimy so we stopped eating it. 
Sticky rice - typical, microwaved and the pieces of glass as a treat.

So after they were told of the pieces of glass, they offered to give me a new one. Which I refused and then they just disappeared. They did remove $2 off my bill."}
{"text":"The food was ok. I was not able to finish everything so i asked for a container to put my chicken sa-te in. I thought it was good that they would do it for me and she took my food in the back to box it up. I gave the waitress a 20% and took my bag out. Afterwards i found out they only boxed up the chicken skewers. Apparently they didn't want to box up the other things i didn't eat. I would love to go back to the restaurant to leave a $0.01 tip. If I can't finish my meal, and ask for a doggie bag at least give me WHAT I ORDERD! Don't tip them anything!"}
{"text":"My 1st time at this location. Food is great ! My wife & I had the BBQ rib plate and combo soup. Will come again while in town"}
{"text":"Love the endless Thai Iced Tea they serve here. I ordered their bbq thai beef salad and it was amazing! I'll definitely come back again for that. I guess next time I'll get the usual pad thai and beef jerky."}
{"text":"This place seems like a total hole in the wall but it's actually a pretty large chain! They have 2 locations in Las Vegas and several locations in California: Cerritos, 2 in LA and Glendale. I was surprised to see that this location isn't thriving like their Cerritos location. The restaurant was empty at 7pm on a Thursday evening, prime dinner time. 

I was craving Thai BBQ chicken so dining here looked promising. Boy, I was not let down! The BBQ chicken marinade was very flavorful. It comes with fried rice which had 2 jumbo prawns and lots of egg bits and they also include their famous sweet and sour sauce which comes in handy for the white parts of the chicken! For $9.95, I was served a generous amount of food - 4 pieces of mix BBQ chicken (wing, leg and 2 thighs), a heaping serving of fried rice, and special sauce. I really enjoyed the chicken plate and would highly recommend ordering this or anything else that is specifically BBQ on the menu. I mean come on, that's their namesake and specialty! Flavor rating: 5/5 

My fiancé ordered the Pad See Ew with beef for $7.50. We thought that the portion size was shockingly small compared to other Thai joints, but the flavor was there. The beef was tender and the broccoli was cooked perfectly with a nice bite. Flavor rating: 4/5

What elevated the Pad See Ew to a delicious level was our special request of thai bird chilies in fish sauce (prik nam pla) - typically you'll see this condiment on the tables of the more legit thai restaurants next to the dried chili, pickled peppers and sugar.  They don't conveniently offer it here, but they were able to whip it up in the back for us and it made the dish pop with so much flavor - super bright and spicy. We loved that sauce! It's probably the best version we have had in a while. Flavor rating: 5/5

This restaurant is a staple for original Thai BBQ and I'm so glad I trusted my gut and cravings on this one."}
{"text":"Meh.  I've experienced better.  I ordered a Thai iced tea ($3.00), the yellow curry with chicken ($8.50), and a beef pad see ew ($7.50).  The Thai iced tea was pretty good.  It was toned down in the sugar department, which is good for some folks, but if you are looking for that sweetness you might be disappointed.  

The yellow curry was pretty bland.  Even ordered hot with extra chili powder, it wasn't anything to rave about in the flavor department.  Apparently they normally make this curry fairly sweet, but I specifically asked for it without extra sugar.  I can imagine this curry with the extra sugar, and it would probably be a typical Americanized curry.  The curry sauce was watery, which I normally like.  The other thing I liked about this curry was that the chicken seemed to be precooked, and was very tender.  Also, the portion of chicken was nicely sized.  There were a couple of thinly sliced peppers though that were pretty skimpy.

I also ordered pad see ew woth beef to go (to go with my Alpha Dog Double Red from Big Dog, yum!).  The noodles were a bit on the overcooked side, although that could have been due to my microwave (I have microwaved pad see ew many times and never had this problem though).  The noodles were a bit on the dry side as far as the sauce used, but that was ok for me.  The kicker was that they don't have Chinese broccoli, so this was served with American broccoli.  

Overall, this place might be good for the lunch specials, but there are so many good Thai places around here.  The service was friendly, but a little slow.  The food was okish.

EDIT: Its been a while since I have thrown out left over Thai food.  The soggy noodles were just gross.  In fact, I have decided to dock Thai BBQ a star."}
{"text":"The ribs here are great! Love the friend rice. Excellent lunch special. It's a bit of a hole in the wall but clean. The servers are nice. My only complaint is they don't let you charge anything less than $20 which is ridiculous when most people use plastic. They should charge a 50 cent fee for credit cards or something. It keeps me from going to lunch there as often as I could because I don't typically carry much cash on me."}
{"text":"Just went in for something to eat around 3:00.  The spare ribs with fried rice from the lunch menu was GREAT.   Service was nice and food came out quickly.  Would definitely go back"}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Thai BBQ for a long time. I don't live as close as I used to so I hadn't been in a whole. I almost always have their their drunken noodles with chicken, the egg roll are delicious, the beef salad is always flavorful. Not sure how they make their peanut sauce for their chicken satay because it's one of the best. Servers are always attentive and we always enjoy it."}
{"text":"I found the food here to be rather bland, and the restaurant was a dive. Save your money and just drive up flamingo two blocks for the other thai bbq . Much better food. Much more flavorful, especially their pad thai. The service here was also rather mediocre. The service at the flamingo/rainbow location is LIGHT years better."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! It doesn't look like much but I love it for the following reasons:

1) Service is great
2) Food- is no frills but it is delicious
3) Tables-are minimal and always clean
3) Restrooms- are spic and span
4) Atmosphere- is pleasantly quiet if you go during the week for dinner. No abnoxious background music. 

I always get the BBQ Beef Salad and the Coconut Soup. Be sure to let your server know how spicy you want the dish! To round out the meal be sure to get either a rice dish or noodle dish. I love their chow mein but their rard nar is good too!"}
{"text":"Definitely not as good as the Original in Downtown LA.  But it will do my friend, it will do...

differences if you really want to know.  Chicken has some sort of bbq sauce that is not the norm.  Original is like a marinade that grills clean and this is like a thick sauce that adds a layer to the chicken.  not exactly my fave.

Rice is not as good and color is the same but taste is not on par.  But the rice seems to be a little different at all locations. 

Overall it was a decent meal and if i have to have it, then there it is.  But if you live in LA and no one in the group is a must have Thai BBQ person, then wait til you get home it is so much better.   and while you are at it get the Cucumber salad with your S-1 its the perfect match.  Even better than the Sweet Sour sauce the chicken comes with."}
{"text":"Food is delicious!

I hadn't been here in quite some time (4 years) since I don't live near. Our party ordered a seafood soup, shrimp chow mein, shrimp fried rice and Rama Shrimp. Everything was delicious! The Rama Shrimp was just as I remembered it. Seafood soup was just as sour as I hoped it would be.

Staff isn't overly friendly, but I don't have any complaints whatsoever. Restaurant is clean.

Wish I had taken a picture to share."}
{"text":"This was our first foray to Thai BBQ - and we were very hopeful since we live in the neighborhood.  I ordered the Chicken Sa-te, only to learn that they were out.  Out?  Really??  Okay.  So I ordered the cucumber salad, the Larb, and my husband ordered the mint chicken.

Cucumber salad was great - but how do you mess up cucumbers, jalapenos, red onions and rice vinegar?  The Larb was terrible.  The chicken was undercooked, it had some grain on it that should have been cooked but wasn't, so it was like taking a bite of sand.  I gagged on it.  $9.00 in the trash can.  The mint chicken was flavorful and thankfully, generous sized portion so we could both eat.  Neither of us are dark meat chicken fans, however, and this was exclusively thigh meat.  

The dining room was empty.  I just can't recommend this.  Wish I could.  Still looking for that neighborhood go-to place (other than Nora's)."}
{"text":"So good!!!! And so cheap too!!! One pad see ew, one A7 and an order of crab wantons $28. Oh and a soda.  So the place is so small and so empty but the food is amazing. The two women in there were really nice and fast."}
{"text":"Really, this place still in business with this kind od low service and food. OMG! we were waiting almost 30 minutes to get our food and they even don't care to come to say it will be delay or anything. food taste is horrible and never go back. place is in the getto area and they do business in getto way!!"}
{"text":"Ugh! I have got to stop letting a coworker talk me into stuff. I just can't like this place. I was very hungry when I went here and it gets the half a star for the food being edible. Besides that I don't know what part of this food is \"Thai\" or \"BBQ.\" Most of the selections on the menu were Chinese or Malay. I had beef satay and rice. The other half of the star was for having passable rice. The beef, not flavorful, kind of tough and only palatable through copious applications of \"peanut\" sauce. The place is cheap but as the saying goes - you get what you pay for ..."}
{"text":"i LOVE this place!

The service is quick and friendly.

On our last visit, my 2-year old insisted on personally tipping our server with her dollar... :)

My boyfriend ALWAYS orders spring rolls and their BBQ chicken dinner.  Its red.  Its tasty. And sweet. And comes with a side of Shrimp Fried Rice.

I like to try different things.

Their pad thai is what you expect pad thai to be.  Noodles. Spicy. Sweet. Yummy with a squeeze of lime.  I can never finish an order in one sitting...but that can partly be blamed on our habit of ordering too much food at once.

They have a nice lunch menu.  I think I've tried their short ribs in black bean or black pepper sauce... the name escapes me but  I remember it being good.

Their chicken curry doesnt spark any fond memories for me.  It doesnt bring up any bad ones, either.

I think their best dish (or my personal favorite) is the beef curry.  The meat is soooo tender and just a little fatty.  The sauce is spicy and rich and creamy.  And its a nice portion; all beef, no veg.  In my opinion, the best BEEF curry ever."}
{"text":"Here's an honest review of this establishment.. I was so enticed by the photos of food on yelp and instagram I had to give this place a try. I ordered the Thai Bbq with fried rice. The bbq was grest, had a sweet kick to it. . As for the fried rice it was a bit bland. Tasted like regular rice with shrimp.. Their pad thai had lots of flavor to the dish. Definitely something to try.. I must say ive head better thai food elsewhere but I would like to come back and try new things.."}
{"text":"Never let me down. Always the go-to place for chicken bbq and beef sate dinner! Their curry and larb are also delicious, original thai dish. Been coming here since day one it opened. Prices are 8.50-13.99. Huge portions! Thai tea is always on point, with refills. The servers are the original servers since day one. Very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Lunch time deliciousness! I came here because my friend wanted to go and introduce me to the amazing things on life like the teas and amazing service. We walked in and were seated immediately. They brought us means and my friend order me the orange tea which I should probably get the name of. I took a look at the menu and had not idea what to order, it all sounded delicious and I was starving. I ended up getting the same plate as him. It's beef curry and it comes with a side of rice. The sauce if a mix or curry and coconut milk and has a little spice to it. I couldn't finish mine but I wanted to. It was tender and mix perfectly with the white rice. Defiantly coming back."}
{"text":"I been a fan of Thai BBQ but only this location Flamingo/Jones. I love their Beef Sate, Beef Panang Curry, and Chicken BBQ. Their portion is pretty reasonable. 

The Beef Sate here is good, it's tender and juicy. Their beef has a lot of flavor and marinated well."}
{"text":"As much as I love their food, I will never dine in here again. The bathroom wasn't working and the right half of the restaurant was shut down, only leaving 3 tables to the left open. We felt so rushed while we were eating, they were giving us to-go boxes while we were eating and the lady that served us even picked up the tip while we were still sitting and had the nerve to ask us why our tip was so low when our bill was $70. My sister and I were so pissed and felt so disrespected."}
{"text":"Best Thai BBQ in town. They have renovated a bit with new tables and chairs. Place is still clean. Friendlier young servers now. I like the guy there who always smiles. Today Valentine at the cashier and our other server was great. Very attentive to our needs and refills drinks. New menu too but a nice cover to that menu Is missing or possibly \"in progress\".  I love S2 BBQ Ribs and hubby likes S1 BBQ chicken- big serving as well. Today's Sunday so no lunch special. Still very good tasting food and refillable Thai tea yummmmm."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great customer service, very friendly workers, again GREAT FOOD!!! Great BBQ live their sauce, huge variety to choose from. Can't remember the name of the food I had, but I remember it was L3"}
{"text":"This place was great!! The food was surprisingly good. To be honest I was a little sketch about the area and the restaurant itself.  I definitely judged before trying but I was impressed.

I ordered a Thai tea which was good, not too sweet but a little too much milk for my taste. The beef pad see eew was great! Perfect for my taste buds. My husband ordered the garlic spare ribs. It was so flavorful and tasty. Only complaint on that is the pork was a little hard chewing for me but still great.

Portion size was okay, not a lot but not as small as I've been reading on here. I would've given it a 5 if I felt more comfortable dining at the place. Overall great hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Thai BBQ is a franchise based in California. I first saw them in LA and was intrigued, but didn't have time to stop in. Thanks to my cousin, I finally lunched at a Thai BBQ!

This restaurant is in a small shopping center, and is the sole non-California Thai BBQ. Inside, a Christmas tree greeted us, and holiday music played. There was enough space to handle a light crowd, yet it wasn't crowded. (It was Friday but I guess their dining room thins out around 1 o'clock?)

Our server waited patiently for my cousin to finish a call (checking in every so often) before taking our orders. When I couldn't decide between the mint chicken or moo pad prigking, he convinced me to get the latter.

My entree's grounded up chicken was the perfect texture, aromatic, and piping hot, and the mint was a nice touch. The chili wasn't as peppery as I preferred, a problem easily solved by the liberal application of table spices. I worried that I was given too much rice, but was proven wrong by the end of the meal. It's not uber-authentic burn-your-colon Thai, but it's perfectly acceptable for lunch.

I left full and happy and so did my wallet - they're not terribly expensive."}
{"text":"The only reason why I am rating this 4-stars is the food. Service was as if we were an inconvenience anytime we asked for anything. Also, a waitress spilled one of the sauces and didn't apologize.

Other than that, the food is amazing. Shrimp fried rice is always on point!"}
{"text":"Popped in for lunch special while waiting for my oil change across the street.  Had satay chicken skewers, yummy peanut sauce.  Served with egg fried rice and small cucumber salad and soup for $8ish.  Service was good, only problem was lack of condiments and dining room was very bland, bit cold and no music or atmosphere."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years. Service has always been great for lunch or dinner. Recently I visited the establishment at around 9:30pm knowing they closed at 11pm, sad to say but the service was not the typical service we receive. The food was rushed, not flavored as the typical delicious food we are used to.  I'm guessing this only happens when the owners/managers aren't there, every other time we go there we see the owners and everything is great. 

In conclusion, if the managers/owners aren't there.. taste and service will lack. I will definitely stick to going there for lunch or early dinner."}
{"text":"We had an afternoon movie in Summerlin and decided to check out this restaurant on Jones, near Flamingo Boulevard. We have driven by so many times in the 2 years we have lived in Las Vegas, but only got here last evening, to find a great new little gem in our neighborhood. 
The outside appearance, wedged in a small strip mall between a smoke shop and mini casino (as are so many Vegas secrets) may be unassuming, but good food is delivered steaming hot and the welcome is very genuine.
We were served very quickly and staff were appropriately attentive. We really like the chicken pad thai, barbecued pork with rice, and delicious tender satays of chicken. I like that in addition to sweet sodas or teas, I could have regular fresh brewed iced tea. My portion was large enough to be my lunch today.
We were so glad to finally discover what's behind the door of this sweet mystery location!!"}
{"text":"Can't leave Vegas without stopping by! Food is super delicious and for the price you get more than you paid for. Try their pork spareribs and don't skip the pink sauce."}
{"text":"I've been coming here he the past 15 years. Food is always amazing and I've never had any problems with the service. I've always ordered their beef satay and a glass of Thai ice tea. Recommended all my friends to this place and they also enjoy it."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants!  Don't be fooled by the outside. Decor takes you to the 70's but the food is delicious!  Grilled chicken or barbecue is their specialty. Portions even for their lunch special is big enough to share.  Authentic Thai flavor served by their very own."}
{"text":"This is the first Thai restaurant I've ever been to in town, and even though I've gone to many other Thai restaurants since then, I'll always go back to this place!

It looks like a total hole in the wall, but their food is amazing!  Not exactly in the best location either, but I'll travel to come here.

They have great lunch specials for under $7.  Their portions are smaller than the dinner portions, but the small portions are still filling.  I like to get the L-3, which is the sauteed beef on a skewer with peanut sauce on the side and shrimp fried rice.

The shrimp fried rice is amazing, especially since the shrimp is huge (they may/may not be prawns just be looking at their size).  Also, ask for the sweet orange sauce.  It's not exactly sweet and sour sauce..it's more of a sweet sauce and I haven't seen any other Thai restaurants carry this sauce.  Just add a few drizzles of this sweet sauce on your shrimp fried rice.

Tom Yum Goong (sp) comes in a cute presentation with the flame.  Other than the cute presentation, it's full of flavor with plenty of shrimp and mushrooms. 

Also, their Thai Tea is one of the better Thai Teas in town."}
{"text":"Waited over an hour for my food. I got the pineapple fried rice. It was a mushy bland mess. All the rice was wet, gummy, and stuck together. Fried rice is a simple dish, and it was $12 for something I couldn't eat. Don't think I'll be going back"}
{"text":"Been going to this Thai BBQ for 15 yrs. You know it's a great place when the menu has never changed and Our fav waiter has been here forever! When he sees us he even knows what we always order. s1and s2!!!"}
{"text":"This location is certainly not as good as the one on Maryland. I ordered S1 and my fiance ordered the combination fried rice. Our food took approximately 45 minutes to be served to us. We thought they were still trying to catch, kill, and cook the chicken somewhere in the back. 

Prior to that, we ordered 2 Thai iced teas and 2 waters when we first sat down. The waiter brought 2 Thai iced teas and 1 water with 2 straws. I pulled up Yelp and found a check-in deal for a free Thai iced tea and asked if I could use it, showed him the coupon on my phone, and he said yes. So I assumed that meant they would just count the one just served to me as free. But instead, he brought me another Thai iced tea. Silly me...

Cut to the food. My fried rice was nice and hot, yet my chicken was room temperature, borderline cold. If there's anything that grosses me out is chicken that feels like it's been sitting out. My fiance's fried rice was nice and hot. Funny thing is when the waitress brought our food, she apologized for the delay and said it was due to not having bean sprouts. What bean sprouts? There were no bean sprouts in the fried rice.

Lastly, this restaurant looks, feels and smells like a dark moldy basement. There are no windows in the main dining area, the tables are sticky, the floors in the bathroom are sticky....all around just dirty and gross. I don't know if I just have high expectations; I'm from L.A. so I've been to the original on 3rd plenty o' times. Definitely won't be back here."}
{"text":"Terrible place!  Ordered in a small pick up order, and was told it'll be done for Pick up in 15 minutes.  Showed in exactly 15, and sat inside the restaurant waiting an extra 30 minutes.  It wasn't a busy day so that cannot be an excuse.  

I will never come back to this place, or refer this place to friends and family.  

Ordered 2 Pad Thai's and a Chicken Curry.  I know for a fact it doesn't take longer than 10 minutes to cook all three dishes with an empty restaurant."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely great but the reason i'm not giving 5 stars is because i had to rush to finish eating since the air freshener was starting to give me a headache. I so wish restaurant managers would understand that those chemicals that air fresneres spill into air don't only ruin someone's eating experience but can trigger asthma and allergic reactions in people. Restaurant should welcome people with great aroma of food (not some fake discusting cherry).  Same goes about cleaners that you wipe your tables with. Ditch the chemicals please and I'll be back for the wonderful food!"}
{"text":"Still one of my favorite Thai places here in Vegas!

* Food is delicious
* Prices are reasonable
* Their lunch specials are great & filling
* AND you get free refills on your Thai Tea

SCORE!!!!

The only cons about this place:

 * Ambiance (too dim & not the cleanest =\ )
* Service is okay"}
{"text":"Good food! Ordered S1-thai bbq chicken dinner & yellow curry. Should have given 5 stars but place felt and looked outdated. It was too dark inside the restaurant. FREE THAI ICED TEA WHEN YOU CHECK IN HERE IN YELP!"}
{"text":"i'm defanitely a regular here. Find me here about once every other week for their lunch special. Their portions are huge! Good enough for one person to endulge on and then have some left to take home. The lunch special ranges from $6.25 to $6.95 and goes on Monday-Friday from 11:00 am to 3:00pm. After that the prices jack up to like $10-20 a plate. 

Many places don't serve fresh thai tea, and this place not only serves fresh thai tea but it's refillable! Don't ever expect it to be one from a can! The tastes is rich, smooth, and soft like really light milk. 

I usually run back and forth with the BBQ ribs or the chicken. I personally like the chicken because its healthier. The marinate is amazing! Everytime I eat there I always wonder how they keep the flavor so rich and full on the chicken! The fried rice is a huge portion, and you can expect the chicken and rice ratio to be very fair and generous when you eat (Everyone knows about the ratio! The rice HAS to equal the right amount of entree in every bite until the end of your meal. If not, it'll be a disaster!).

It comes with a side salad which is really just lettuce and two pieces of tomato, but their sesame dressing on it is to die for! So contents, or more so missing contents, of the salad doesn't matter, especially since it's a side salad anyway.

Other items to try, is the Naked Shrip Salad which a favorite. The crab ragoons, and the shrimp pad thai. Good luck! Hope you enjoy your experience!"}
{"text":"Thai BBQ has been consistent in both service and taste! They're located right down the road from my job, making it a super convenient (& affordable) lunch option for me - I can just call in and they have my food hot & ready to be picked up in minutes. I suggest taking advantage of their awesome lunch specials that run until 4:00 PM everyday! About $7.95 got me a hearty helping of beef sa te (3 skewers) and fried rice - which is probably the best fried rice I've had in while. There's also a small cucumber salad that comes with, which is a refreshing way to break up all that savory flavor. Overall, great taste & great prices. Can't get much better that that."}
{"text":"I love this place! Every time I have Thai craving or craving spicy in general, this is one of the option that comes to mind! I love their thai beef jerky with the super good thai salsa. The crab wontons are also on of my favorite appetizers. The Thai chicken bbq is definitely a different kind of bbq, but it is sooooo good! AND for the price you are paying, you are definitely getting worth with the amount. 

TIP: Check-in on YELP and you will receive a free glass of Thai Tea, or should I say BOMB THAI TEA!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered delivery.  Food came timely.  Food was okay.  I ordered off the ala cart menu which stated it came with steamed rice.  I did not receive that."}
{"text":"There many restaurants here & there & the so. But how many them have gems? ...Not much right. Usually they cater to non-fan Thai food customers.
This is something I'm not found of at all. 
Why removed something that makes it authentic?

But hey, I have good news.

Fortunately this place is a Emerald to my likely, when it comes to authentic 'Thai Food\". 

A good thing should not be compromise."}
{"text":".great juicy chicken and  barbequed  beef sate! not bad for a little over 20 dollars. felt cleaner to eat it at home..."}
{"text":"One of best plays to eat Thai food
We love it our kids also great service 
Will come again ..........................:)))))))))))))"}
{"text":"Been to this location several times but it's probably been 2-3 years. I used to like the location just off LV Blvd on the way Downtown best.

Thai Iced Tea was as flavorful as ever. I came here at Lunch and was tempted to go with one of the Lunch Specials (served until 3 pm I believe). But after careful review of the menu I went with one of my stand-bys the Pad See Ew. I went with the beef version.

Service was fine but I was a little disappointed in the meal. The beef was overdone and tough. The main vegtable is broccoli and it was underdone and tough. I also found it a little bland and made use of the hot sauce. It's interesting as a recent April review praised this exact dish. Goes to go things can vary day by day.

Next time I might try the other location, on Maryland parkway, never been to that one."}
{"text":"Chicken was dry. There's nothing worse than having a meal when the food is dry flavorless and not hot. I will give this another try someday but this will not be my first choice when it come to thai."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for over 15 yrs and this place is still as delicious and enjoyable as I remember. The food always comes out tasty. 
The servers here for very caring and attentive. They really love working here since they been here since I've been coming here. 
I did notice they cut back very slightly on the portion cause I had the satay chicken and it used to come out really big. But even though it's a bit smaller the portion size is still a great size for he price.  I've also catered my daughter baptism from here and the portion is amazing size. 
If you want authentic Thai this place is the right place for you. 
Andy and Jenny has always been my server and they totally makes this place an amazing place to dine. Make sure to ask for them."}
{"text":"You know when people come to your home town and want to eat at the local \"hole in the wall\" restaurants? Well, this is one of them. It's a little off the strip. 

It doesn't look so beautiful inside or outside but don't let that stop you from the yummy food they serve. I always order the chicken curry (yellow sauce and not to spicy) and the Pad Thai noodles. Make sure you get the unlimited Thai Tea yes I said it \"UNLIMITED\" Free refills. Man o man do I take advantage of that.   

I've been here a lot and I continue to come here because of the food. Sometime the services isn't that great (especially when their busy) but like I said, I'm giving them 5 stars for their food."}
{"text":"My sister and I ordered take out from this place last night, and it was LEGIT! Amazing Thai flavors, generous portions and a good value.  I'm not sure what happened to these people who said their food was bland, this was nothing but flavorful and delicious. We ordered summer rolls which were super fresh, the yum soon sen salad, which was a generous  portion and full of flavor, and the panang curry with chicken which was full of so much chicken! I usually like some veggies too, but you can't complain when a place gives you meat and not a bunch of fillers.  The place is definitely not winning style awards as it's a hole in the wall, but the ladies in front were super friendly, the food was prepared quickly and I'd definite recommend!"}
{"text":"This is our new year start with the worst taste of thai food i ever had in Las vegas,. We didnt have many choices to pic the restaurant the new year day and finally we went this place to eat thinking long time situated there and get a decent food for the dinner,. one of My favorite food category spoiled by NO TASTE thai place with slowest service i ever experienced. The moment we entered there were no people in the restaurant make me a bad sign about the food and we were sitting on middle of the restaurant with coziness and the over heating. Reasonable waitress kindly asking to order i took my chance with the Soup first. We had the soup with very clear water with chicken pieces and couple of shrimp with cabbage.  So we order the Speciality menu and get the better taste with the main course. 
Believe or not, As far as we had the watery taste of the soup was continue with the whole food verity six of us ordered. we shared the food with our family to find something wow about the food. Absolutely nothing we can get treat our taste buds!!!
Finally we paid our over Hundred dollar of our bill and get out with sour faces to go home on the January 1st. I don't recommend to anybody to go to this place Period!
This only one star they got bcos of the reasonable service...."}
{"text":"Pros: I've been going here for awhile, 4 stars for the food; it's pretty good and the waiter who's probably been working there forever is always nice ans 5 stars for the unlimited Thai tea! It's one of the only place I know who serves bottomless Thai tea :-D 

Cons: I don't mind looking like a hole on the wall outside but the inside needs a bit of love. I'm NOT a fan of their dim lights, looks so dark in there :-/ I don't know if it's just my preference not to eat in the dark but this is the reason why I usually choose Archi's Thai Kitchen few streets away. and I was very disappointed with the honey duck; it tasted like it has been marinated for a week, the texture was tough, rubbery, and just had way too much fat."}
{"text":"Just to give myself some credibility, I will let you know that Thai is my favorite type of food and I have tried pretty much every Thai restaurant in Las Vegas, San Diego CA, Temecula/Murrieta CA, and quite a few in Los Angeles and Orange County. 

This is, by far, the absolute worst thing I have ever experienced... it was so disgusting I couldn't eat it. The chicken was undercooked, curry was bland, rice was cold, and so....yeah. I left hungry and sad."}
{"text":"I'm disappointed. The usual Thai BBQ I go to on Flamingo/Rainbow closed early, so we tried this one. We had shrimp fried rice and chicken coconut soup. The chicken is dark meat. The soup was bland. The rice had too many onions and chunks of tomato. I'll be sticking to the one I love.

The spot is also kind of dirty and smells smoky."}
{"text":"We been going to this place for more that 10 years. They cook everything fresh. Great and friendly service."}
{"text":"Bbq chicken w shrimp fried rice plate is a must! When I lived here I couldn't find anything close to Huli Huli chicken from back home in Hawaii until I found this place. Pretty close in taste, trust me. For an added bonus checked in on Yelp & got a free Thai iced tea, refreshing as well!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for bang for your buck, Thai BBQ offers large portion sizes at a good price. However, you get what you pay for. My chicken and shrimp were a little over cooked. Come here if you're just plain hungry not if you expecting the best meal."}
{"text":"We love ordering take out from here. I also just learned they directly deliver or you can use the app.  The Shrimp Pad Thai, Beef Satay, Combination Soup and Cumumber salad all met our expectations and filled our cravings. The angel wings weren't as crispy and filling not as tasty from what I got in the past. Unfortunately the Thai Tea, which tasted good, spilled in my cup holder because the styrofoam was so weak and it broke from the bottom. Other than that, we'd still order from Thai Bbq when we're craving Thai food."}
{"text":"One of the best Thai BBQ restaurants in town. This is a little place but it had some ambiance though (especially compared to the one in downtown). Even though it was small, there was always quite a few customers inside (mostly booth seating) on each side of the main floor. It's not quite a hole-in-the wall kind of place. It's kind of cozy feeling, actually. It's dimly lit, but not dark like the original King & I on Trop/Maryland (really dark inside). The small parking lot is in need of updating/repaving. 

The thai beef salad, pad thai, and thai style fried rice are pretty good. Portion size was pretty good, too. The prices are reasonable. The service was good. I used to come here a lot. Probably the best one out of the family of restaurants. The one on Maryland comes second."}
{"text":"Placed an order, 15 mins go by after confirmation of my order and they call me to tell me that they ran out of the order and that they replaced it with something similar. Then after an hour they delivered it with someone who doesn't speak English and doesn't have change on them. My meal was originally 30 dollars and ended up costing me 50 dollars because the delivery driver didn't bring change; after an hour an a half on waiting on this meal to come. And when I finally get to eat the meal it comes to me cold and it's mostly rice and the meaty that they gave me was mostly fat. Worst experience with ordering through yelp."}
{"text":"Since when do you use regular broccoli in pad as ew? Ewww! I was craving Thai and this place did not fix my fix. I ordered for pick up and when I got there after the 15 minutes they told me, was when they started to cook my food because I heard the guy call out my order again. The chicken they use always looks like the throw away pieces to me too."}
{"text":"I've driven by this restaurant for more than a decade, and finally decided to give it try, I thought you couldn't go wrong with such a longevity. The decor is very basic, and the atmosphere a little loud with families and children, but we didn't mind, especially since service was very friendly. We ordered a BBQ Chicken dinner; the house classic, and mixed beef and chicken Satay skewers. Both dishes tasted pretty good with generous servings, except for one major downer: the shrimp rice that comes with both dishes was very disappointing, soft and mushy kinda like a Mexican rice, except that this was supposed to be Thai. Rice being a main staple, it did affect our experience enough to decide that it wasn't worth returning."}
{"text":"Portions are big. Refillable Thai iced tea!!!
Very friendly service, fast and consistent.

My family and I always go here whenever we crave Thai food FAST! We usually call in advance to order our food before we even get there. So by the time we arrive the food is ready and we just dig in!

Their Naked Shrimp salad is a crowd favorite. Those giant shrimp and the dressing is just addicting. The Thai Bbq Chicken is what we usually order with their regular fried rice. Everything we pretty much tried all tasted great. From their pad thai to \"Sweet Angel,\" their food was delicious across the board. So no complaints here. 

I know they have a lot of other locations in the valley, but this one's the one we kept going back to."}
{"text":"Tried the BBQ ribs and the chicken sate. Sate was very good. The ribs were a little too chewy for me. All in all it was pretty good."}
{"text":"Meh I've experienced better definitely sums it up. 

I've eaten at a couple of Thai BBQ locations (which I've also reviewed) so I know the menu pretty well. Don't give me wrong the food is delicious and the portions are huge. But to me service and atmosphere do play in effect on how my food tastes overall. This place looks run down, from the outside it looks runned down. Insides not any better. I don't think they've ever changed their carpet there because it looks so dirty. I Highly doubt I'd go to this location but the foods good, cheap, for a great value. My suggestion to the owners is maybe re innervate the place."}
{"text":"i rarely ever will speak bad about Original Thai BBQ, but this is an exception.  I guess i was spoiled by the Thai BBQ places in CA.  Trying this chain restaurant out of state was something i will not do again.

First of all the prices.  Over in CA, all specials cost at between 8 - 12 dollars, with the more popular options being below 10.  Well, over here, only the BBQ chicken was $8.95 and everything else was priced $10.95 and above.  Ok so i thought that there must be something more special about this place - huge portions of their cucumber salad, refills on sauce, etc, but their portions were unimpressive...which brings me to my next point. 

The portions were small.  Usually, im accustomed to seeing mounds of rice spread out all over my oval shaped plate.  But when our food came, imagine 6 adult faces staring at each other with a hidden WTF? face.  of course, we didnt want to make it obvious in front of our servers.  Rice was pre molded in like a bowl shape.  Presentation was nice but we came for the food. And usually, the Sate sticks are maybe 3 finger lengths long, but over here, it was 2.  

The inside was ok.  Not the best of places, but not the worst of places either.  There were alot of couples there, i think about 2 of them, 2 couples i mean, weere making out in booths - definitely NOT a family friendly environment. 

i will say that the food pretty much tastes the same.  No watered down sauces here, thats for sure.  Service was great.  And they also give out free refills of Thai Iced Tea!  thats a first, and at only $2.50, its a pretty good deal.  

anyways, ok so i had to give it three stars due to its overall package  Sorry i had to complain about this place, but come over here to CA Thai BBQ's  and youll see what i mean..."}
{"text":"This place is a bit of a whole in the wall but I love it! The reason why I like it so much is because they have combo plates and they have bottomless Thai Iced tea. I hate ordering ala carte . I think if I order meat rice should come with it ..I just hate being nickle and dimed for everything. Whenever I eat here my Thai Tea never goes empty. Which 
I deeply appreciate after the service that I received at Basil n Lime the prior night. I'd much rather eat here even though it's not the fanciest place in town. They did upgrade their chairs from last time though ...looks much better! 

I started off with Tom Kar Kai ( Spicy Chicken Coconut Soup). It had chicken with coconut and mushrooms in a hot and sour soup with a touch of lemon grass. It was really good and it also got rid of my sore throat! Then I had their Sa-Te dinner combo which was served with cucumber salad, beef skewers, and shrimp fried rice. It was very tasty and the beef was tender. 

My husband had a side of their Cucumber salad because he can't eat Thai food two times in a row. (We had to stop at Burger King for him before we came here.) I felt abnormal as he watched me eat but I'm sorry I needed my Thai fix satisfied! 

I like this Thai BBQ the best because I tried this other Thai BBQ on Flamingo but they didn't offer the bottomless Thai Tea. I'd rather drive further down the road to eat here!"}
{"text":"Dont let the dingy interior scare you. We  Ordered the Seafood Tom Yam Soup and Combination Fried rice with Thai Ice Tea. It was all worth it and value for its price. The fried rice can feed 3-4 people and the soup was large also. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I had to update my review on this place because I had given it 3 stars for their lack of spice.... then the next time I went, they did provide a side of serrano peppers for me to add to my food and made my order spicier than last time.... so I added one more star!! The flavor as it comes is actually excellent and portions are also generous.... I'm just a spice freak...  I definitely enjoyed the summer rolls as well because they were nice and fresh and the dipping sauce was good. 

The overall menu is not exactly the thai food I expect. No drunken noodles (my favorite), no thai basil dishes.... of course they had pad thai and curry. Lunch specials don't include any noodle dishes (a negative) but the price is fantastic (a positive). I definitely think this is a good place to go for lunch. 

huge plus on the free thai ice tea refills!! That is not common (:"}
{"text":"Very good Thai food. Excellent service. I just wished that couple sitting across the restaurant would keep their kids quiet! (banging the utensils on table and wall)"}
{"text":"BS +++

One word Jenny! She's so nice and attentive.  Ok back to the food! First of, CHECK IN guys they are offering a FREE THAI ICED TEA.  So good!!  Food  first of is clean and not too salty.  They  take custom orders if you have food allergies.  The place is  a bit  old but don't let it fool you.  The FOOD is what you came in for not a 4 star fancy restaurant with a 2 star chef.  This place is homey and cozy.  Bring a sweater though since it's chilly inside.  But to warm myself I ordered the spicy soup.  This place is in a really sketchy little area but it's so good.  It's next to a bar and a deli.  Just come in with your family and expect a 5 star treatment.  The waiters are super friendly.  Take it from me.  I been to A LOT of thai restaurants and this place is top 5.


Food is BOMB
Hostess/servers are SUPER FRIENDLY
Restrooms are CLEAN
Tables CLEAN
Table wait time QUICK
Take out wait time is QUICK
Customer service is GREAT
Ambiance DARK but COMFY (chilly inside)

{"text":"Best thai BBQ... I've been to the other one in Vegas and also 3 thai BBQ in Cali (long beach, Carson, and cerritos) but this one is by far my fav place... They have their own style of rice which is so good. their crab wanton and their thai BBQ ribs is soo good..."}
{"text":"Again with the omissions. I used to frequent this corner almost every day after work, and it's nice to see that the lunch specials and the holes in some of the upholstery remain exactly as I remember. Does anyone know how long this place has been around, really? Everyone I've gone with has varying accounts, ranging from a couple years to a decade. 

Yesterday afternoon I was getting the mid-afternoon lags yet had an irrepressible urge to go bowling. Met up with the group at the bowling alley and suggested we head down the street. Sure enough, everything was familiar and the nonstop Thai Tea gave all of us a major sugar rush. I swear, that stuff is badass. I mean, I'm a pretty laid back individual but when I've had almost a full pitcher together with my Satay (Spelled \"Sate\", pronouce it like \"Gate,\" trust me, they LOVE it when you do that) and Angel Wings (Stuffed chicken wing; like a Bicep on roids), I'm practically one of those radio announcers tryingtosayallthe fineprintintheadbeforethe30-secondtimelimitrunsoutforlegalpurposes.  

As others have mentioned, nostalgia gets killed quick by inflation. What's up with the prices for the non-lunch specials? I hardly eat here on the weekends and couldn't help but notice that our checks never hovered around the Franklin mark before. And yes, I've frequented the Redondo and Culver City Thai BBQs back home, so the serving sizes did sadden me. Tough times, mang. Maybe I like my Thai food more pedestrian, maybe their \"MegaHott!\" doesn't scorch my colon as much as Archi's....but I've always had a soft spot in my arteries for this place. If you're looking for a more \"authentic\" Thai experience, look elsewhere. This is the YOSHINOYA of Thai spots, methinks."}
{"text":"The Sa Te Dinners are really good that's what I basically get all the time. The only reason I'm rating 4 is because they charge extra for every little thing and I found a white hair in my rice once! Disgusting but the food is good!"}
{"text":"Decor is old and outdated but I actually love it! Food was a little oily but was so good! We had the beef satay, garlic ribs, and shrimp and pork fried rice. The thai tea had just the right amount of sweetness as well."}
{"text":"This place has been around for a long time.  We have not visited this restaurant in years.  The location is not great...located between a smoke shop and a bar.  Yelpers you can check in and get free Thai tea.  We checked in then showed the server our check in before she brought us our bill.  She told us that we had to pay for the Thai tea we ordered because we had refills but she can give us Thai tea to go for checking in.  Well not what we expected but did not want to argue and just took our free drink to go.

We ordered Shrimp Pad thai, bbq chicken dinner and rad na.  Food is typical thai food and free refills on Thai tea.  The food is the best value in town.  

Service is okay at its best.  We were almost done eating before we got the pad thai.  The servers were good about refilling our water but never asked if we wanted refills on our Thai tea.  My son asked for to refill his Thai tea then the server refilled his Thai tea without offering to refill my daughters cup which was completely empty.  

It will be probably be years again before I visit this establishment again."}
{"text":"LOVE Thai BBQ!! My boyfriend and I always get the S-8 meal. Soooo delicious! If you're looking for awesome food stop here!"}
{"text":"Been going to this place for 20 years and today was a major disappointment. First, waitress was in a hurry for us to order (wait will you?), then ordered the shrimp sour soup and beef sate dinner and spring rolls which were great BUT the shrimp dinner and Thai Basil rice were AWFUL! The Thai Basil Rice is an old family favorite but waitress gave me something else and tried to pass it off as the one I ordered BUT NO! Had them take it back and then brought another wrong one. Guess they don't have the same cooks anymore because no where near as good as before. Will go to another location from now on.... Service terrible too, the red headed waitress is very rude and has NO time for you. I hope the owner realizes what's going on when they're not there, could be major problem. They've lost a consistent and loyal customer."}
{"text":"I've been eyeing this place for a while now but didn't get the chance to eat here until this afternoon.  Let me tell you I'm sad I did not eat here sooner.  The thai bbq and shrimp tempura is amazing.  Prices are reasonable and the variety of lunch specials are great options.  Service was quick and food was hot. I can't wait until I go back and eat here again."}
{"text":"Ordered yellow curry w/ chicken & crab rangoons for delivery. The yellow curry came a weird brownish color, and I never seen chicken that color before either. There were no potatoes or carrots in my yellow curry like most thai places put. The crab rangoons tasted like they were fried in old oil and had a bitter taste. Threw the food out. Then checked the restaurant out on the Health District's website. They have a long history of bad ratings & even got shut down by the health department... dont believe me, look them up... wish I would have checked that out before ordering. Will never eat here again."}
{"text":"The reviews don't seem all that fair, but I've been here last week and I really enjoyed the food. We ordered BBQ chicken, pad thai, chicken  salad, and tom ka soup. 

The food came out fresh and tasty- no complaints whatsoever. My friend said the Thai tea was too sweet- but whatever. 

Overall the place has ok parking and not situated in the best side of town, but the food is well worth coming to visit. 

Foodies- try it out!"}
{"text":"I came here today around lunch time to order food to go for a party of 15-20 people. I definitely have to say that I was so impressed by their food and service here. I ordered the chicken and beef satay, fried rice, and chicken pad thai. It took about an hour to make (which is reasonable for all the food I ordered). The staff working the front were extremely nice and helpful. One of them even gave me two free Thai iced teas when I tried checking in with Yelp to get the free Thai iced tea promo. She told me to save it for the next time I come back. She also included a large tray of extra cucumber salad with my order which was super nice of her. I brought the food back to work and it was a big hit with my coworkers. Everyone (including me) loved the food and were surprised how huge and generous the portions are. Everything was delicious. I definitely recommend this place if you want great Thai food and excellent service."}
{"text":"Thai BBQ has never disappointed me, but also has never impressed me either. It's a reliable spot for lunch, since they offer lunch specials for around $7.  Lunch specials do not include any noodle dishes like pad thai or pad see ew, but can still be ordered off of the regular menu for a decent price. 

The chicken or beef satay lunch special comes with 3 sticks of protein of your choice, fried rice, peanut sauce, and cucumber salad. Pretty good portion, left content. Next time, I'll have to read the fine print. Most other Thai places include a soup and egg roll. Our lunch specials did not come with these. 

It's been awhile since I've had it, but get the BBQ chicken, it's their signature dish. A few places in town try to replicate it, but it's not as good.

If I am in the area again, I'll have to remind my tastebuds of the BBQ chicken!

{"text":"Ordered take out and it was really good! My food was done in the time limit they stated and their service was nice"}
{"text":"I was disappointed because I love the Thai BBQ downtown (by the Stratosphere) and I thought this was a chain, but this is nothing like the other one. I also went to the other two in town and they were even more disappointing. Out of the 4 I have been to in town this one is the second best. My favorite thing here is the mint chicken. Very nice staff though. I would come back if I were in the neighborhood but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"What makes me coming back to this place? EGGROLLS! They are so different then the regular pork or veggie rolls! They have ground pork in these with a spice to it! I am addicted to them

I had the chow mein for the first time here and I am happy with the results! The food is always so hot and tasty. Very fast and kind service."}
{"text":"First time customer.. ordered a padthai for pick up.  I called to let them know that we want the pad thai spicy number. The person who answered my call just respond okay.  Didnt explain their range is 1-5 i thought its from 1 - 10... we always eat in a thai resto and they always go to 1 to 10.  They should always inform their guest about their spicy range. Its a total waste of money the pad thai was so dry, and tooo hella spicy to eat.. i eat spicy food but this is just like eating a chili .. no flavor to it at all.  Im not just upset .. i have eaten a lot of pad thai and I can tell you that this is not even  close to the good ones.."}
{"text":"3 stars (that's being nice) bc the BBQ Chx is good sometimes can be dry so I asked for extra sweet sauce mind u the sauce containers are super small 2 dips and that's it so she gives me a WHOPPINg 2 extra for 3 lunch specials and my $3- Thai tea was all ice and not filled to the top! Not to mention she looked at me crazy wen I asked for extra sauce! Poor Cust service!"}
{"text":"I came here with my family and aunt on a weekday night. We order a lot of food which was fairly reasonable.

- Loved that you can get thai tea refills. bonus!
- pad thai is a bit dry. needs a bit more flavor for my preference. 
- fried rice portion is totally ample. Filipinos gotta have their rice. 
- bbq chicken is tasty. not dry. a bit bony. good bbq style. 
- the restaurant is a bit too dark, but i guess its avoid the heat?

{"text":"Called and ordered my food to-go. Ive been a regular of Thai BBQ in Los Angeles on 3rd St for 20 years. I had no Idea they had one out here in Vegas. I found it on YELP. I was super excited. Although they don't have the salmon plate I like to order I still go for the Sate plate and tom yum soup. On Yelp they gave an offer if u checked in you would get a free Thai ICe Tea. Once I got to the restaurant I proceeded to pull out the phone to check in and she said that it was only for Dine-IN. Like it doesn't say anything about dine-In only to receive free Thai ice tea. The place seemed very dead tonight. Not sure if it's like this all the time. Defiantly not like 3rd st. Not sure if I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Slow for lunch. Service was not so welcoming. I wanted to order my lunch to go but shit here to eat and was given so much shit for it. I got timed lunch so I needed to order it to go so it could be ready but didn't let me eat at location.  I hope the food is good."}
{"text":"Awesome food....I love love love this place.Best tai restaurant in Vegas...Everything tastes delicious,literally every dish."}
{"text":"Me and the hubby wanted to try a different thai place and stumbled here... The dishes were good I liked mine but the curry my husband ordered tasted a little off... The dinner specials are pretty big portions so you will get your money's worth ... The thai tea was good I'm glad you can get a refill!!!!the egg rolls did not taste that good..."}
{"text":"One of the first Thai places in Vegas that my husband and I had tried.  We've tried a lot more since, but every once in a while we find our way back here.  There is only a couple of tables occupied, and service is always great and today was no exception, our order was taken and our drinks brought out.

Within a matter of minutes our food began to arrive, I got the ruby chicken, deep fried, stuffed served with a sweet and sour dipping sauce, mixed with red peppers, onion and pineapple pieces.   And it comes with fried rice with shrimp.

My husband got the beef sa-te with peanut dipping sauce and we split them both.  We also shared pad thai noddles.  The food was fresh, just enough spice and served pipping hot"}
{"text":"Easily the worst Thai food I've ever had. My medium pad see-ew wasn't just lacking spice-- it was completely devoid of any flavor whatsoever, except perhaps for a vague whiff of wet dog. The spring rolls were a mealy disappointment. Even the Thai Beef Salad was like eating air. Avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"Let start by saying I love Thai bbq this one is dry the L1 this is the one thing that should be good I miss the location on flamingo it was the best"}
{"text":"Never again, I had to request them to reheat my Pad Thai, and they actually did. Asking to Reheat my food relates to GIVE ME A NEW ONE. All my food was Room Temperature or colder..."}
{"text":"I only go here since its so damn close to my apt.  Its just average Thai food.  I don't think the prices are bad.  You get 4 pieces of bbq chicken breast for like $7.50 which isn't that unreasonable.  We always get some kind of noodle too which have all been fine. I kind of wished they used less dark meat in their chicken dishes but that's about it."}
{"text":"It was nice to try something different. I don't think that I have a taste for Thai food but the food wasn't bad. We ordered the garlic short ribs and shrimp & vegetable tempura. I gave this place a 3/5 because the service was decent and the food was good. Overall the restaurant itself is in an old space so it might've contributed to the smell you first smell when you enter the restaurant. It was also really cold where we sat, and the server kind of told our party to move to fit into one table to \"have room for other guests.\" They also don't honor their yelp check in."}
{"text":"Visiting the Vegas Strip can prove to be a financial burden for anyone who has to be on a budget. So my friend and I decided to check this place out. Arriving there at 3:00 p.m., we found ourselves amongst a handful of people there at this particular Thai Original BBQ Restaurant location. Really, nothing special when you look from the outside. A small sign in the front is the only indication it MIGHT be a Thai restaurant. But coming in, the smell of this establishment told us it was definitely not going to be bad. We were seated right away. My only complaint might be the lack of any windows. The interior, itself, was dark and dank. We were brought to our seats immediately. The menu was, of course, full of the traditional Thai meals one would expect. But ordering their famous barbecue half-chicken, let's just say it was a flavor explosion- cooked to perfection and basted just right (without the sauce being overwhelming)- and spicy, leaving a nice heat on the palate long after consumption. My friend had the chicken skewers and rice, with peanut sauce as condiment. The thing that also made the experience of note was the speed in which our meals were done (10 minutes from order). No, it didn't feel rushed (yet, it was perhaps the fact we had come in during a not-so-busy time). But the service was nevertheless prompt and attentive, and our waiter always came over to give us refills on our drink as well as to ask us if we were enjoying our meals. Please take into account again that we came at perhaps the best possible time. But if you like Thai food with prompt service, and want to avoid spending exorbitant prices that are typical at the Strip, you ought to consider taking a 10 minute trip outside of it and check out this unassuming-looking spot to satisfy your palate. It's worth it."}
{"text":"Been a big fan of this restaurant for years. Bought two S2 and S1 to go today but when I picked up the food the rice color was brown when it should've been java rice. Chicken and ribs was not grilled. Plus the sauce was color pink and not the regular sweet sauce. Very disappointed. not going back to this restaurant anymore! The quality of food was very poor as compared to the other thai bbq located in LA."}
{"text":"I ordered a chao mein with Shrimp, and was not pleased with it.. the shrimp looked and tasted like they were just put in water..noodles were not good either"}
{"text":"We usually go to their branch in Maryland, we just gave this one a shot since it is closer to my work. The place was dark, no windows, smelled old and musty, worst part is, the food they serve is cold. You can tell it was not freshly cooked. I ordered the bbq chicken and bf got the ribs, both were cold and dry, even the rice was cold! Go to the ones on Maryland instead where food is freshly cooked and served warm."}
{"text":"This place has the best Thai ribs BBQ and Pepper Steak! Plus, their thai tea is unlimited refills. We love coming here and JENNY the server is always so nice and very welcoming."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this Thai BBQ for the last 13 or so years. I'm so disappointed that it has gone downhill!!! Another customer was speaking to the waitress and said what we were about to say. We found out they have a new cook. 

We ordered the small combination soup and two sa-te beef dinners. I had the Thai Iced Tea, and my hubby a coke (can). The combination soup came out first. The chicken and pork tasted days old. The mushrooms were questionable, as if they were about to go bad. Then our sa-te beef dinners. The rice was old and greasy. It lacked any flavor. The beef was tough. Some pieces were cooked medium and others rare! 

On a positive note, my Thai Iced Tea has refills. My husbands coke didn't. They're canned. :/ 

I am so disappointed. We're from LA and this was one of those restaurants that made LV a little more like home. Maybe it's time to finally move on."}
{"text":"I ordered two dishes for carry out and intended to use the offer for a free Thai iced tea with checkin. When I went to pick up the food and showed the girl the Yelp offer, she said I couldn't use it because it was only for dine-in. There was nothing that said anything about only for dine-in. I spent the same amount of money as I would have if I had dined in, and they didn't have to do any work to clean up after me, so why would they not honor their Yelp offer?"}
{"text":"i love thai bbq. been eating at the ones in LA since i was a kid... not as good as LA, but it is pretty much the same. I get the chicken and rice... 

It comes with their classic sweet & sour sauce & red rice. its the shit!
i also get the beef bbq. super good... dip it in the same sauce... i think you can get it as a combo with the two meats.

highly recommended."}
{"text":"Awesome, one of me and my bf's favorite places to eat. That house sauce in the shrimp fried rice is soooo addicting. The Tom Kar Kai chicken coconut soup is one of my favorites... as well as the classic BBQ chicken which is always amazing. We always ask for extra house sauce cups at the end of our visit! Lol"}
{"text":"I don't care about the service or area or whatever others talk about other than the food. Because they have the best phad thai, beef panang, beef satay and BBQ chicken! Not to mention their refillable thai iced tea. I've been coming to thai BBQ for almost 20 years now and the food is still delicious!"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!!!! BEST FOOD EVER! It was our first time in Vegas and this place was around the corner from our hotel. Best Thai food we all ever had and I left so satisfied and yet I wanted to bring home extra plates just because I loved the food so much! Completely recommend this place! If I lived in Vegas this would be my regular spot. Great service, great price, great setting.... GREAT EVERYTHING!!! Love love love!!!"}
{"text":"I was extremely disappointed with this location. The restaurant is dark, drabby and dumpy. My bbq chicken was bloody and undercooked. I was embarrassed after I suggested to a friend who was in the mood for Thai food that we try this location.

The prices are high and portion is tiny with flavorless food in which mine was not cooked well. This was a waste and a lesson learned to keep true to Archi's Thai! 

I wonder if the people that order food from here have seen the restaurant? It is not the cleanest, and could use a good dusting. 

I won't be back, end of story."}
{"text":"I was so bummed - I ordered from Door Dash last night - the Pad Thai and Basil Pork. I found the Pad Thai below average (and I used to LOVE this place) and the Basil Pork was just eh. I think this place has gone downhill :("}
{"text":"The worst Thai Bbq I've had. There food is just so different from California Thai Bbq. Being different is fine but there food is like weird different. S2 bbq was so sweet thatvit didn't taste like thai. There portion was so small. The fried rice taste like blant. Sweet and sour chicken was super sweet. Everything we ate was like bad. 1 star was for their staff they were nice & friendly. Will never go back here."}
{"text":"When it comes to cheap lunches on the westside of town, nothing beats Thai BBQ on Jones. Many a time have coworkers and I stopped in for a great meal on the cheap. 

Have tried it a few times outside of lunch which just means the portions are a little larger and prices higher but still great Thai food. Oh... and the service is awesome! 

The only thing I have against this place is their water tastes weird to me, but things like hot tea or ice in my sprite are all good. Odd.... Maybe it is just me."}
{"text":"Don't let the store front discourage you. Food and service were great Thai BBQ chickens were good and the Satay beef were better than most of the Thai BBQ restaurants I tried even better than the Original Thai BBQ restaurant in Los Angeles."}
{"text":"The beef sate dinner is consistently good here. $11.95 for a pretty big portion. I ordered two beef sate dinners and after splitting it with two other people, still have some leftovers. Their non-bbq menu items can be hit or miss."}
{"text":"No free thai tea with a check in. False advertisement. Apparently, it's for dine in customers only. If you order food to go and check in, you still have to pay for your own thai tea."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this restaurant ever since I was 6 and every time I've come I can't get enough of the delicious fried rice with their bbq chicken! The staff and customer service is great and they never let me down. They give such respect to their customers and its so pleasing to see that they care. If I can't decide where to go, this is the place where I'll end up in. All their meals and desserts take my breath away and leave me with a full stomach."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. Don't let the outside fool you, this place is legit. The yellow curry is nice and thicker with great flavor. They have the best sauces for all of their apps. Tom yum is one of the best I've had. But my all time favorite is their chow mien. I know I know chow mien at a thai place? Let me tell you, that sauce and the beef cut they use is so good. I get it spicy and all the flavors blend so well together!"}
{"text":"My family and I love thai food! This is one of our favorite places to eat. The food is great and the service is great! Everything we've had on the menu was delicious!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here at least 10 times! And Every time its on point! And free Thai tea refill?! Mint! I'm a regular here that loves the food and kind people working."}
{"text":"I used to come here a few years ago and loved their BBQ chicken platter. The place is still the same but the last time we came it was kinda musty. My friend and I would come after mental health clinical because Monte vista was literally a minute away if you drove. The lunch special was great because it came with so much food and I loved the way they cooked their rice. This time I found an egg shell as I chewed into my rice and that's one of the reasons why they got the testing from me of a 3 start. The chicken is as good as I remember and can't complain about the price for the amount of food they serve food lunch. We came here a total of 4 times during that rotation which tells you that the food and the price of it was good enough to keep us coming."}
