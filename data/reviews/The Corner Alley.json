{"text":"Love the new bar that opens up to East 4th.  My problem is with any bar that has anything on the menu called spicy that is ridiculously mild.  At least have a hot sauce behind the bar so I can spice it up.  Bartender had to go the kitchen to get a mild buffalo sauce.  Get with the times...you should have at least sriracha or Tabasco.  I admit that I love extremely spicy food.  But, I'm reasonable and don't expect that from anyplace but a good Thai restaurant.  The spicy bbq wings I had tonight were anything but.  I would think the bbq wings would have tasted the same."}
{"text":"Walk in, the hostesses have mean looks on their faces - not welcoming. Bartenders are inattentive but the arcade games and lanes are cool."}
{"text":"The rating is based on what the Corner Alley is, rather than what it is not.  It is not your retro ghetto keepin it real we're actually here to bowl bowling alley.  It is a trendier upscale downtown bar that happens to have a bowling alley.

The problem with putting bowling alleys in downtown areas is that they take up too much space.  Which is probably why most of these places have to be more upscale, to make the money back.  But having been to places like Lucky Strike and Kings in other cities, I definitely think Corner Alley does the best with the upscale model, while keeping it real enough to actually bowl.  The only downside is that most other people there don't really know bowling etiquette.

I have gone mostly on weeknights, when there is usually ample availability of lanes.  Nice that you don't have to compete with leagues here.  The drinks flow freely while you bowl, and the service (I've had the same server every time, I think) is excellent.  The drinks are reasonably priced too, and the bud light bottles are cute bowling pin shapes.  Bonus.

I've never seen anyone in the massive front bar/restaurant area.  But then again, I've only been during the week.

My one major piece of advice is DO NOT order the fried pickles.  I am a sucker for fried pickles and will order them every chance I get.  I was so excited to see them on a Cleveland menu.  My waitress warned me, however, that these were sweet, not dill pickles.  Then, when I went to the restroom, she warned my date.  (He wisely thought better than to override my order.)  And all I can say was, she was right.  Fried sweet pickles are disgusting.  But I can't blame Corner Alley - although why do they make them this way? - because I was more than sufficiently warned.  Let this be my warning to you, and hopefully you will not be as stubborn about it as I was.

Basically, Corner Alley is a good central place downtown to go with co-workers or friends where there is something to do other than just eat or drink.  The activity makes things more interesting.  And it's a good balance for a group with bowlers and non-bowlers."}
{"text":"Fun bowling but way over priced.shitty food, the pizza was a tortilla.mediocre service big lack of communication between staff members. Waitress didn't know the alcohols"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible experience!!!  Service was extremely slow - took 10 minutes to just get waters and there were only 3-4 other tables.  Our server was nice but was terrible as a server. I wish we would have gotten up to leave when no one came back to our table after delivering the waters. Food was very bad too. I will never go here again and will never recommend it!"}
{"text":"Didn't know there were so many Cleveland police available to escort people home. People that shouldn't be dancing everywhere. Go for a good people watch."}
{"text":"Super cool place!! Having bowling but it is not your average bowling alley. Jeremy the bar tender was super friendly! We had about 15 min for a table outside, weather was perfect so great to eat outside. Had veggie wrap with added chicken. Was delicious! A friend ordered a wedge salad and the veggie wrap with chicken....chef actually made a new dish out of this vs serving 2 meals. Was perfect! Wait staff awesome as well."}
{"text":"Pretty crappy experience. Went to the bar to get drinks around 1pm on the 4th of July. Bar wasn't busy, waited 15 mins without any service and then decided to ask the hostess for a seat outside. Once seated our table was covered in food and sticky. Ordered a side of fries and 4 beers and while drinking the beers and eating the fries the server continually pushed us to finish. She picked up my beer twice trying to clear the table while i still had near half of it left. Not a very positive experience, will not be going again with so many other alternatives near by."}
{"text":"So we are in Cleveland for the tribe game and decide to try this place.  WHAT A JOKE!!!  We were told 25 minute wait so at 30 minutes I go to check. Told by the hostess that we should be seated in 30 minutes.  The manager said the kitchen is so backed up they can't seat any open tables.  I looked and a total of 14 tables were open.  Holiday weekend with a home Indians game and this is what you get.  Who manages this place???  Please save your money and walk down the street to any place other than this one!!!!  JOKE!"}
{"text":"Was interested to see the new renovations.  Nine empty four tops ...no one waiting in lobby...told a 30 minute wait...asked why there is a wait ...was just told that's how we do things.  Decided to go to barrio instead much better choice."}
{"text":"Don't overlook this place for a good meal at a good price just because it is a bowling alley. My wife and I stopped in here on a Thursday to grab dinner before going to the casino. She had the salmon, which she loved. I had the strip steak which was very good, especially the mashed potatoes! At only $21, it was a great deal for a steak dinner. Best part of the meal was our server, Howard. Very polite and attentive...the kind of server you hope you get at any restaurant!"}
{"text":"Our food was delicious. Erin was our server and she was polite, helpful, and attentive. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went here to eat & bowl before a concert at House of Blues. (right next door) It turned into a perfect date night. This place is clean, fun and had great wings. I'll go again."}
{"text":"I called to make reservations for two lanes on Saturday April 23rd, for two hours. 4:30-6:30. As soon as we got there they took us to the VIP (4 lane) private part of the Corner Alley. Maybe i should have been clear we didn't need VIP, i mean $200... to bowl for 12 people for two hours just was shocking to me. So we are put in there VIP corner with (4 lanes, again we only needed two) we had to ask for a server more than once. She came over and said well is this one check? ... almost upset she had to care for us. Sorry but this is my brothers 21st birthday party and we are a great family to take care of, we put it on one check so we didn't \"stress her out\". Then she goes \" what would you like\" (Me being a server for about 7 years) Said well sorry but we dont even have menus. after waiting 10-15 minutes i had to walk across the place to get a handful of menus. (by the way the bar back by the lanes wasn't open.) He was setting up and we were waiting on that bar to open) Just weird we had to keep walking to the bar when you first walk in to get quicker service. So ok we order. The pizzas were great, the chicken nachos are poorly made, not loaded at all. But the Buff Chicken Rolls were actually awesome. Once the food came out, we didn't have plates. All waited for the plates for about 5 minutes while everything was pretty much getting cold. I had to ask her personally for napkins for everyone, and silverware. I just don't understand. She never made one suggestion after we were looking at the menus in the mean time. or how about bringing waters, plates, napkins ETC. If she was busy i get it. But there is no excuse. I understand! No pre-bussing was done so we basically cleaned it up for her. Never asked how anything was.She just really showed how much she didn't want to help us or even be friendly while working. At least fake it till you make it, i mean come on. After spending a good $350 ill never do this again. We were better off going somewhere else. Luckily my brother was fine, but i was just surprised the service was that bad. upsetting because the atmosphere is pretty cool."}
{"text":"I have never left a post before, but I feel like I have to after my experience with this Bowling Alley. I have tried to go to this place on three different occasions now and everytime was turned away. The first two times I was advised that they didn't have any lanes open. I can handle that once but the second time was ridiculous. However, I was still able to get over that fact, but what happen on my third was unbelievable. I called on a Sunday morning to make reservations, at which time they advised I couldn't make reservations.  They went on to say that they accept walk-ins. At 8:30 pm we walked and asked for a lane, to just he told they were closed. Funny, because there were customers bowling and the sign said they didn't close til 10 pm.  The place was crowded, but still had some open lanes left, so how were they closed already. Needless to say, I only gave a one star, because I had too, it doesn't even deserve a one star. Hopefully you don't have an awful experience like this. Stay away and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Went last night during the cavs game... Love the atmosphere and being able to see the game in every direction you look! The beer selection was awesome and service was attentive! BUT I wouldn't eat there again... We got the brisket nachos which was essentially chips with a ton of BBQ sauce and a little fatty meat. Nope never again!"}
{"text":"Grilled chicken sandwich was good, but my friends said their burgers were average. Long wait for a table (not because there were no tables but because the kitchen was backed up)."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, but the food is terrible and service isn't much better. Was there for the NCAA tournament games. Ordered a hamburger. I assumed it would be well done since my waiter never asked how I wanted it. I have never seen a burger that pink."}
{"text":"Went before an Indians game it was not very busy the food was overpriced and not that good. The service was worse than the food but still left around 15% in cash. When I looked at bank account online a few days later they had gave themselves another 17 dollars. I called to try to straighten things out but was told there's nothing they can do it my word against there's. Will never go back and don't think anyone else should either"}
{"text":"Bowling was alright, VERY loud. Food was terrible. The waiter said that the ingredients on our pizza were right when they weren't and we had to pull up the online menu to prove him wrong. Everything we got was very bland. I would never pay money to eat that food again. Server was terrible. Huge waste of money. Everyone in our family ate less than half their meal because it wasn't even enjoyable. We will never be back."}
{"text":"The wings and chicken sandwich that I had was really good.  The food prices are not bad.  My husband didn't really care for the grilled cheese sandwich or the garlic parm fries.  I agree that the fries are not great.  Service was great!  We didn't bowl, but I can tell you it is $25 per lane per hour. Too pricey to me for bowling.   I love the décor and the bar.  It's definitely worth trying if you need a bite to eat."}
{"text":"Great for a date! Husband and I bowled for an hour. Lanes are clean, service was friendly and prompt, drinks and appetizers came out quickly and as expected, and prices aren't bad- for downtown! Never disappointed when we come here!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't suggest this place for a large group of people, but I've been here on a few 1-on-1 dates and it was almost perfect. The first time I went, I felt sorry for a new friend of mine who was being neglected on his birthday, so we went walking through downtown and stumbled inside. We played a game of bowling and ate a pizza. It was a fun time.

With my next boyfriend, we would go regularly and do something different everytime. We always went during happy hour. We played pool once and ate, another time we bowled, and a few times we just went to eat. Their fried crayfish was to die for.

Although we always had a good time, it was a little pricey for teenagers and we always had to remind them that it was happy hour to get our discounts."}
{"text":"Waited 45 minutes for the food, talked to the manager who insisted it was only 20 and we have 5 orders before us (even though everyone around us who arrived later already had their food). Got up and left hungry (a couple next to us got up and left even sooner - before the waiter arrived, we should have done the same)"}
{"text":"Stopped in Saturday afternoon with a big group of guys before Indians game.  2 girls behind bar went above and beyond to take care of us, one even helped take drinks downstairs when we decided to play darts.    They were pretty busy but still got really friendly and attentive service.  The pricing is good for a downtown bar- the service was exceptional.
Can't review food as we did not eat.  Just wanted to send a bravo to the staff and thanks for a great time."}
{"text":"Absolutely appalled. If I could give less than 1 star I would. As paying customers, 30 minutes before they closed, the smug Asian worker (I identify because I also, am Asian) told us to hurry up and \"get the fuck out.\" I literally don't know what else to say... He said the F word to us... I have never been treated like this, EVER. I work in a customer service related field and you just can't treat ANYONE who walks into your doors this way. Disgusting."}
{"text":"We have now held 2 Corporate team building events at Corney Alley, and both have been wildly successful.  The catering options provided a wide range for us to choose from.  The staff was very attentive and even had a quick turnaround when we decided to order even more food!"}
{"text":"Here on business thought I would give it a try. Food is ok service is terrible. VERY RUDE young lady bartending. Just nasty will not be returning."}
{"text":"The beer is ok. The customer service SUCKS! Worst experience I have had in a long time. No one cared if I was there or not."}
{"text":"Looks like it would be a cool place, but seems very poorly managed and run. Came in on a Sunday at around 7, there were at least 5 open tables in the bar area, but they wouldn't seat us, saying the kitchen was backed up and it would be an hour wait. When we said that's ok, we aren't getting food, we will just have drinks, they said go to the bar. We said, there are no seats at the bar, can we just sit at one of the 5 open tables. Nope. Hostess was not friendly about it at all. So we, and a number of other people left.  Lost my business. Get better management."}
{"text":"\"upscale bowling\".

does anyone else find this to be an oxymoron?"}
{"text":"the food and drinks were great when we actually got them... our server/bartender was not very attentive (she walked by our closed menus amd empty glasses numerous times). however, one of her co-workers (Brittany) was all over it and kept our drinks full and checked on us often. we would happily revisit, despite the subpar service from one bartender. Brittany was awesome and turned us on to a new shot!! thank you!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of the remodel and the new Corner Alley. I liked it before, but it definitely received a major upgrade. The bar is a fun atmosphere to hang out in, and they have an excellent white peach margarita (highly recommend). Also they have a great menu with a diverse range of food -- I got the BBQ chicken pizza and it was fantastic, and although it was too big to eat all of it by myself in one sitting, it was perfect for leftovers the next day. I have also had great service everytime I've gone. It's a staple on East 4th."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday afternoon with the kids for half-price bowling. It's a clean, fun place with happy and fun employees who want you to have a good time. Unlike every other bowling alley I've been too. It also doesn't have that musty bowling alley smell either which is a win in my book. If you want authentic Cleveland bowling, then maybe not, stick with Freeway lanes or Cloverleaf. 

By the way, our lane messed up with pins a few times and each time they responded quickly and fixed it. Then, when we left, they didn't charge us for the bowling, only the shoe rental to apologize. Now that is how you gain a customer. I don't see any reason to go anywhere else to bowl with my family ever again. I will be back."}
{"text":"Went in for some bowling after some bar hoping downtown. Our group was visiting from Cali and Vegas. What a cool spot! It was clean and had great service.  Cleveland we didn't expect a lot on our trip but you certainly impressed."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible experience. Although my fiancé and I were seated promptly, we didn't even see so much as a presence of a waitress for nearly 20 minutes. When a waitress finally made a pass buy us it took a solid effort to grab her attention. I would mention the waitresses  name but it was never given nor was a greeting or an acknowledgment of our wait. With the wait we unfortunately endured we of course had time to look at the menu, and decide what we wanted. We knew at this point service of course would not be the best during our visit so we ordered drinks and food while the waitress was still at our table with hopes of moving this process along as quick as possible. We both ordered water with lemon and about ten minutes later our drinks arrived. Water. With no lemon. That's the least of my concerns. My fiance ordered the mushroom burger cooked medium well with fries. Myself, I ordered the cheesy pizza with brisket. After the server took our food to the wrong table it finally arrived. At this point it's already been an hour since we've been seated. One look at our food and it was sheer disappointment. The burger was well under cooked and the fries tasted as if they were microwaved. As for the pizza. Well. The \"brisket\" was comprable to unseasoned sizzle steak that was seemingly dropped in a Boiling Pot of water untill it turned grey carelessly thrown on to one side of the pizza and labeled as a topping, and i unfortunately payed extra for it.  If this is how your brisket normally is, would take it off the menu entirely. I would have like to order a beer to wash down what I was able to eat, but with out us even asking our check was thrown on the table as our waitress rushed by. We looked at the bill, paid our due and promptly exited. I do not belive I will visit this establishment again."}
{"text":"We came here to watch the CAVS play in game three of the Eastern Conference championship. We were settled in to watch the game with about 200 other fans, when all of a sudden they announce they will kick everyone out around halftime for a private event starting at 10:00PM. Really!!!!???? WTF! Everyone had to leave the bar and go elsewhere. They gave no warning, nothing just took our money and kicked us out... Pathetic."}
{"text":"Corner Alley is pretty popular around the city. My boyfriend and I have been there two times. The first time, we only had drinks. We both ordered a Long Island Ice Tea, but both were very weak and very sugary. The second time we went we had the garlic parmesan fries which were actually really really good! We also each had a burger which weren't bad, but also nothing special. 

Both times we went to Corner Alley it was really cramped. You're sitting elbow to elbow with other parties and it's difficult to have a conversation without feeling like you're being listened in on. It's even hard to get into your seat without bumping those around you. 

Overall it's okay. We might be back because I live down the street, but it's not a place I'd recommend to friends over other places downtown."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!!  I love having a bowling alley downtown (although the lanes are 4 feet shorter than PBA regulation for you pros out there).  No matter, the lanes are still great.  The pizza and wings are AMAZING!  I have not tried much else off the menu, but I'm sure it's all great.  The bar is cool with lots of TVs.  The carry-out is hit and miss.  I once ordered 10 wings and was told they would be ready in 10 mins on the phone and ended up waiting there for almost an hour with the bartender repeadly telling me, \"it'll just be a few more minutes, sir.\"  BUT they are good enough that In was willing to wait."}
{"text":"Great place to stop in!  Our tradition when day-drinking in a new town is to have one or two beers, a snack, and ask the bartender for a recommendation as to where to go next.  

We walked right up to the bar and a very handsome young bartender came by to see what we wanted to drink.  He made some recommendations about the beer that we were quite pleased with.  

We shared the werst platter which was very tasty and the perfect size for two people to snack on.

The bartender sent us to City Tap next which was a great suggestion!"}
{"text":"Happy hour drinkers BEWARE!
I ordered a drink, only to find out it was over twice the price I expected to pay. I spoke with the manager to clarify. He was not apologetic for the confusion. He said this drink is not included in the happy hour menu. This was strange to me because I have ordered this drink several times before at the uptown location during happy hour. He had a very 'take it or leave it ' attitude. Despite questioning the HH price difference btwn the two stores, the manager claimed he called the uptown restaurant and confirmed the regular menu price was the same. Gee, thanks... Fine, I was willing to pay the $12 bucks and be done with it. But his attitude throughout the ordeal changed my mind. I refunded my order. I feel I wasn't being treated like a customer,but more like an instigator and he was compelled to put me in my place."}
{"text":"The bowling is expensive but the atmosphere is pretty fun. 

I ate on the patio last Thursday night with my dad. The servers were all very friendly and we liked the music in the background. 

Our food was good. There just isn't anything spectacular about the menu. But, if you are a meat and potatoes type of person that is pretty easy to please, you will be happy with the food."}
{"text":"Food was delicious but it took a VERY long time to come out. #ridiculous, and the mild wings were way too hot."}
{"text":"Good food and drink, but way understaffed. Sitting at bar watching people walk out because they are tired of waiting to order. Get more bartenders especially for Friday happy hour."}
{"text":"For starters, the place is quite cold inside, even the workers are wearing their jackets. The atmosphere is loud, as you would expect. Our drinks came shortly after we ordered them, one of the iced teas had a floater in it, not sure what it was but our waitress replaced the drink with a new one. The food was decent but not a favorite. We opted for the garlic parm fries for an extra $3 and I would pass on them next time, they weren't very flavorful, kind of a bland taste. The loaded nacho burger was \"good\" but nothing to write home about. The mushroom pizza had potential but it was overly oily making the crust soggy. Overall I might give this place a second chance but not before trying all of the other wonderful options in CLE..."}
{"text":"I love the concept of this place - food, bowling, and arcade games. The new design is nice too, but they missed some key elements. 
You should call ahead of time to make reservations. They start taking them on Monday for the current week. That in itself was a process. It took multiple phone calls for me to get through to the one person who takes bowling reservations. I was placed on eternal hold, transferred to the wrong number, and accidentally hung up on multiple times before I spoke with the correct person. 
Once we got there, checking in was another process. They had one person taking payment, giving shoes, and showing people to their lanes at 8pm on a Saturday night. We walked to our lane which was nice - although VERY hot -, and our server was great, unfortunately I didn't get his name. I felt like the drinks were a little over priced for a bowling alley in Cleveland, but they were tasty and not light on the booze. We asked to have the Cavs game put on the TVs near our lane and one was broken, so our request was only half fulfilled. The lane next to us made the same request a few minutes later. 
Once we finished bowling we went downstairs to play some arcade games. It was even hotter downstairs. The thermostat read 80 degrees. They have no servers or bar downstairs, and they have don't have a change machine but all of the games take quarters. So we trekked back upstairs for quarters, but we didn't use them all because we couldn't take the heat for long. We decided to back upstairs and play shuffleboard, however there was almost no sand on the board. We played anyway and it was fine. 
All in all, it was just ok. I was very underwhelmed. With a few minor improvements though this place could be great."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place.  It is an upscale bowling alley for sure.  Great wine list and the food looks super yummy.  We have bowled here twice and it's always a good time."}
{"text":"Our party of 9 got kicked off a table on NYE for two people who wanted to eat. We were planning on spending the rest of the evening but after being pushed out after purchasing several rounds of shots for two small meals ordered by two possible employees. The manager did nothing about this. The whole night was pretty bullshit. Would not recommend especially on special events."}
{"text":"My husband and I were in Ohio for the weekend,  and decided to check this place out. Ordered some wings, fries and Beers. Service was very slow and not very friendly.  When packing up our leftovers, noticed an eyelash in my wings.  When I informed the waiter he just walked away,  then someone comes to my table and says to me if I have a problem.  I said if you don't think having hair in your food is a Problem, then Yes we do have a problem.  He said well I won't charge you for the wings and walks away.  Doesn't apologize or try to make things better for us.   I would not ever go back there again,  and I would not recommend this place to anyone.  The Manager should be Fired. He needs better training if he is going to deal with people.  You have a lot of Tourists in that area,  it's a shame for them to get treated the way we were treated.

{"text":"Came after the Cavs game, it was busy but we got a table within minutes. The staff was very nice and drinks were average price and strong. No complaints! They have it divided so if you wanted to bring kids to eat and bowl you can and not feel like they are in a \"bar\""}
{"text":"Stopped in for a cocktail and a quick bite to eat tonight.  I had a White Peach Mimosa that was delicious.  The loaded cheese fries were LOADED with cheese sauce which was a bit overwhelming.  They are still his favorite appetizer on the menu. The server was very polite in returning them and getting a new order prepared with just a little less cheese. The ambiance was really relaxed and enjoyable. The TVs had every football game on imaginable(perfect for any man) and the servers were polite and quick to take the orders. The bar area was very clean, which is always nice to see.  It was a very nice way to end a relaxing Black Friday!"}
{"text":"I'm a newb to East Fourth, but my first few times there were really fun.  I love that the street is just for pedestrians.  The Corner Alley was a good time because it combines bowling and a pretty nice bar.  The staff was nice and attentive (it wasn't busy).  I only didn't give five stars because the beer selection left something to be desired but it was ok."}
{"text":"I dont think i will ever come here again.  This is the first time I've ever slammed an establishment.  I came here in march before a basketball game and it was kind of crowded and I gave them a pass because everything was slow and the orders were not correct.  There was also a group of teenagers that came through essentially Wilding and acting like thugs. Then today, I brought a group of friends here Sunday before an indians game.  Not crowded at all!  Ordered drinks.  Server made a big deal of the bloody Mary's so we ordered them.  Ten minutes later we are told there is no bloody Mary mix.  Ok.  We order other drinks and place are food order.  Ten minutes at least before we get our drinks.  We order more when we get these because it's taking so long and we are looking around and there just aren't many people.  After we have been there 45 minutes with no food, I ask for a manager.  Ten minutes go by, no manager.  The game is getting ready to start so I paid for our drinks and left.  Total bummer of a start to a fun day."}
{"text":"Stopped in purely because they had outdoor seating in the shade and we didn't feel like walking in the sun anymore. We ate lunch and didn't play any games. Food-service-only review.

The hostess was less than friendly. She tried to seat us inside (which was almost empty) and we asked to be sat outside. She sat us a tiny 2-top next to another couple at an adjacent tiny 2-top. Plenty of other tables available, so I just slid down the bench to a 4-top. If they were super busy, sure we'll be cramped, but not trying to eat in the laps of the other patrons if we don't have to do that.

That was the only hiccup. 

Our server, James, was polite, friendly, and x'd all the check boxes on good service. He read us the specials and I opted for a margarita. It was a fair price on a delicious beverage. My sweetheart and I shared BRISKET NACHOS and TURKEY REUBEN w/ HONEY-LIME BRUSSELS SPROUTS. The portions were substantial, thank goodness for $12 a pop. 

The brisket is cut small enough to eat on a saratoga chip. The cheese sauce was flavorful and smooth. The seasoning with the cheese and beef was a really nice not-too-spicy spice blend. Would definitely order it again.

The turkey reuben was very light for a reuben sandwich. It was not greasy or heavy in any way. It was a toasted thinly sliced white rye and very mild sauerkraut with peppered shredded turkey. I asked for the 1000 Island sauce on the side and was able to portion that perfectly to my palate. Very nice for a day of walking around downtown without the lethargy of a heavy sandwich. 

The sprouts were my favorite of the meal. The honey-lime flavors saturated the cabbage-ness and married with each other perfectly. I could eat a whole other order right now and I'm not even hungry! It was a surprisingly good option to have with the reuben, too. 

Based on this one meal experience, I would recommend this to anyone looking for a quick and delicious meal with unique flavor combinations."}
{"text":"My review goes from start to finish on my entire experience. 

My family was coming in town from out of town to celebrate Christmas so I tried to make bowling reservations 3 weeks in advance, they informed me they only do it the week of... That's fine. 

I called the week of on Monday the 14th of December. A boy answered the phone took all my information then said he would call me back to let me know if my reservation was ok or not? Since I've never booked before I thought that was maybe how they did things. 

After no call back the next day I called to check on my reservation.  The girl said to me \" oh I wish you would have called back yesterday because now I have nothing available and there is no note about your call. \" So after a long discussion I asked if we could come two hours earlier and I would change my day around. 

The day of my reservation which was Saturday the 19th - someone called me at 12:15 to confirm our reservation for 3 pm...... My reservation was at 1:30 .. I was finishing up at work and called her back at 12:30 and insured her we were coming in an hour and that it was at 1:30 not 3:00. Her response was \" oh ok ya I see that \" and then hung up on me. 

I was meeting my family there after work and coming from the east side and they were coming downtown from Avon Lake. My husband arrived before me ( with 13 other people from my family) only to learn the computers were shut down and they couldn't open any lanes. WE PAID 60$ To park 3 cars downtown .. Not to mention when I talked to her ONE HOUR before hand she never once mentioned the lanes were broken. The girl at the counter told my husband the lanes were down all morning ... The manager said they broke an hour ago. WHY WHY WHY wouldn't you tell me this on the phone when I talked to them an hour prior. My husband explained they had called and that we paid 60$ to park. The girl I spoke with when my husband gave me the phone kept saying \" I don't know what to do with ya'll , I'll have to reschedule ya'll .. We had to cancel a vip party too \" THEY OFFERED US NOTHING WHAT SO EVER , they said they could send us to the university circle location however we had other plans downtown. My husband even asked about us paying for Parking .. No response. I find this to be completely unacceptable and so unprofessional. Not to mention to girl at the counter sounded like she was in 7th grade on the phone with zero manners or any training. Why she wouldn't just tell us ahead of time that the lanes were broken is beyond me. It completely ruined our day... They told us they would call if the lanes got back up and running because someone was on the way to fix them .. Never got a call or anything. I will never make a reservation with them again nor recommend them. I already told my family friend that was planning on doing a large party in February to plan something else because of the disaster we had. Unprofessional, unacceptable and it sounds like no one there knows what they are doing."}
{"text":"We went for an early dinner on a Friday evening.  The staff was very nice and they have an extensive menu.  i had the \"Italian Grinder\" and was less than impressed.  Nothing special about the bun, nothing special about the meat.  Could have been bought at any supermarket I would think.  very boring sandwich.  The best thing on the plate were the chips which were great.  My wife had the pulled pork which she said was good, but nothing special.  it would be convenient if you wanted dinner and to bowl, but i'm sure there are way better choices for a good meal in cleveland."}
{"text":"I stopped in here with a friend I was staying with while in Cleveland. Located in a perfect location on East 4th street, I walked in from 4th and didn't even notice that there was a bowling alley in the back. I sat down in one of the booths, and the wait staff was friendly and attentive enough. The menu had a variety of bar-foods available, and I decided to go with the pizza margherita and a pumpkin beer. Unfortunately, I felt that the pizza left a lot to de desired.  The cheese to sauce ratio was way too high.  I understand that it's a delicate balance, particularly for a pizza with no other toppings, but it was definitely below par compared to many other margherita pizzas I have had before. The restaurant was a cool little place, but if I come back to Cleveland I will not stop in here again."}
{"text":"Yay!! The only bar open during Christmas Eve! Cheers to the employee working that night. This place has all the amenities you need to spend memorable time with your friends over board games, bowling, and other games available. We came here ordered the sweet potato fries and played Urban Dictionary card games, and others, very fun atmosphere!! One thing though, sweet potato fries came with sort of sweet, hot, and tangy sauce, very good, should've ordered more. It was delicious, however hard to find parking spots. Parked all the way in the other side of public square to get here! A must visit place if you're in CLE for a short visit or just to bring friends and be merry!"}
{"text":"Not the world's biggest bowling alley but still a lot of fun.  Good music playing and lights give it a rock 'n' roll vibe we played for a few hours and had ton of fun. They have a menu that includes food and alcohol as well so you can eat while you bowl or there's an area that is indoor outdoor including a bar if you decide you just want to eat and not bowl. I can imagine this place would fill up pretty quick on a busy evening. My only small gripe is the service was a little slow with getting water refills. Granted, we did have a large party that was ordering a lot of food and drinks however we might have needed an additional server considering there were about 20 of us"}
{"text":"If there was an award for \"Most Lackluster Service\", this place would win. I came to the Corner Alley with some friends after an Indians game on a Friday night. We're from out of town and heard that this place was a fun spot for bowling and beers after a game. I went to request a lane, but there were 3 people ahead of me...no big deal, the attendant said it should be \"45 mins max\". (I called earlier that day and the same person said they don't have reservations at 11 so we should've been fine...guess not).

So I put my name in and went to get a drink, only to find a group of bartenders who could not be any less excited to be there serving drinks. We left for another bar after one drink and figured we would return when our lane was ready. Almost 2 hours later (now 1 am), we return to the bar to see my name still the third in line for bowling. I went over to the lanes and discovered that only ONE of the SIXTEEN lanes was being used for bowling. Are you serious? We all left completely dissatisfied; can't say I'll be recommending this place to anyone coming to Cleveland."}
{"text":"We were out taking in the sights before the cavs game and we went in and bowled for an hour. Really clean, full service on the lanes (u order they bring it right out to the lane), and the staff was really friendly. TVs everywhere and it was a really good time."}
{"text":"Came here today for a quick lunch before meeting with clients on Euclid.  I had the Autumn Salad and added chicken and avocado.  For $12 I was pretty impressed and left satisfied."}
{"text":"Upon entering this establishment tonight we were 'greeted' by quite possibly the most unhappy staff I've ever encountered. They offer a 'Tower' of tap beers, 128oz, which was the only cool thing about this place. It seemed as though ordering this labeled us as people who no longer required any service, we had to attack people behind the bar to order food. Regardless, the way that this establishment handles their 'Touch Tunes' jukebox service was not cool. We paid $20 to play music when we arrived, which allowed us 10 songs. Another group of patrons started playing very weird music, which the staff proceeded to skip (wasn't mad), but they skipped ALL of the music which included my 10 songs. After the unsavory songs played they continued to skip all of my music and gossiping like mean girls behind the bar about it. Under their control we listen to nothing or nothing, yet I spent money to listen to music. I brought this up with our bartender that showed about as much interest as she did when we entered the restaurant. All and all I thought the pizza we got was good and we enjoyed our Tower, otherwise this staff needs an attitude adjustment and DO NOT spend your money trying to play music."}
{"text":"My friend and I wanted to go visit the casino on a Saturday night and we decided to get dinner at the Corner Alley because they have a patio right on the corner of East 4th street so we thought it would be great people watching, and of course I had a coupon too! I called a day in advance to make a reservation for 2 on the patio and the girl on the phone was very pleasant and said that would be no problem. They have a reservation system that sends you a text the day of where you can confirm your reservation which I thought was really neat! However, when we arrived they did not have a table on the patio for us, but instead we were left sitting inside at a table right by the bar. Somewhat disappointing because it was such a beautiful day I would really have rather been sitting outside where I was originally told we would be. Instead of making a fuss I just sucked it up though, we still had a good people watching seat - just less people to watch. I ordered the BBQ Chicken pizza and man was I not disappointed! I ate the whole thing!!! Definitely one of the best pizzas I have ever had. However, our waitress took forever to bring our check so that again didn't sit well with us. Our plates were completely empty and we probably waited about 15-20 minutes from finishing our meal before she ever came by and dropped off a check. But the food was so delicious that I will be returning anyways! If your service stinks, food can always make up for it in my opinion!"}
{"text":"Terrible. Terrible. Terrible. After making reservations for 6:15pm, we weren't seated until 6:40pm. That was after we had to ask, repeatedly, why there were so many empty tables to the disaffected host, who really should think about a career change. Upon sitting in our hard-won booth, our server did not acknowledge our existence for 10min. Once we placed our drink order, it was another 10min before our drinks arrived. At that point we were about to miss our concert and we had watched about 10 tables worth of food die a slow death under heat lamps at the pass. Probably the worst experience and most mismanaged restaurant I've ever seen. We walked out and had an amazing trio of pretzels and cheese cups at the arena. Do. Not. Recommend."}
{"text":"If you are looking for bar style food, The Corner Alley is a good option. The brick fired pizza is a great choice at TCA. Outdoor seating available for the nice evenings to sit outside. Samantha provided excellent service and was very attentive."}
{"text":"Went to bowl and eat, will probably not return. Service wasn't great, two pairs of silverware came dirty, my salad dressing was served in a broken metal ramekin, bathrooms weren't clean, bowling balls came back so drenched in grease that it was hard to hold onto them. A fun concept, but poorly executed and clearly not monitored properly by management."}
{"text":"I love this place. Yes it is expensive but it downtown. Plus I like how they give you free shoe rentals during happy hour. Honestly it is a way nicer kept bowling alley. Everytime my friends and I try to go bowling somehwere in the suburbs there are always leagues and other events. 

The drinks aren't too bad. The place is very clean and staff is great. 

My only complaint the bathrooms were very unkept. I am was thinking for the rest of the joint to looked great- the bathroom really was somewhat filthy."}
{"text":"Who knew bowling could be classy? Every bowling alley I've ever been to (which isn't many, to be honest) is a run down, smokey, hole in the wall kind of joint. So, I was super impressed when this place was the exact opposite. 

We didn't really plan on going bowling, we were just up in Cleveland from Akron, walking around after grabbing some dinner and doing a little shopping when this place crossed our path. So, we figure why not?

We went in and discovered that you needed reservations to bowl, which we obviously didn't have. The guy at the counter was awesome enough to give us a lane that was reserved about 45 minutes out and told us we could bowl until they arrive/about 30 minutes. He gave us the lane for half price and we had just enough time to get one game in. 

It was a lot of fun and the cocktail service was great. We didn't eat so this is purely on what I saw and the customer service. 

I'd definitely make plans, and reservations, to return."}
{"text":"Service was great.. but you have to walk to the pisser.. fine... that's fine... but to dry your hangs you have to squat.. (male) and three are broken in the ladies... but love this place"}
{"text":"Where do you start! Ok the decor well it seems very beat up, everything is dirty heck even the bowling balls and black smeared that people use to bowl , half of the \"free\" games do not work or hardly work or are just cheap garage or basement quality games. They really could have a good thing if they just cleaned it up a bit  ok \"no a lot\". Lets move on too the whole reason we stopped in too try the food. We got sat quickly getting service took a few minutes getting our spinach dip took a lot of  time and for what they charge we where lucky if it was more then 9 ounces cheap and very under portioned, now our main items buffalo chicken sandwich \"really a single 4 ounce chicken strip dipped in red hot served on a baby bun for $11 with seven or eight cheap fries!  Or a $13 dried our brisket sandwich with a cup of of beef base water. Who ever runs this ship or owns it i hope your read all these reviews because your in a great spot and could have a huge hit if you & your staff took a lot more pride in appearance,  customer service, quantity & quality of the over priced stuff you serve..."}
{"text":"It is CLE Restaurant Week and the Alley was offering 1 app, 2 items from their ON BREAD menu(burger,BBQ pork etc. and fries) and a sundae for $30. Unfortunately, the management forgot to tell our waitress. But Annie got it all straightened out. We were a party of 6 stopping for a bite before the hockey game. My wife got the Braised Brisket Dip w/fries. I got the BBQ burger w/mac n' cheese. And our son got a veggie burger with mac/cheese. A step above your local bowling alley.
  The other 3 orders: r cheese burger,  mushroom pizza. The artichoke dip was tasty but for $9 they should have had a bigger serving. Chips & Veggies were fresh & crisp. Patty melt was done medium as ordered, the rye bread was way bigger that the burger, but the burger was just right size. cheese, onion & mushrooms were perfect. Fries were crispy but extra parmigiana was disappointing, just small portion of cheese on only a few of the fries. Am used to the whole order covered & mixed with the fries at other restaurants, will get plain fries next time. The Alley Sunday was one scope each of choc, vanilla & strawberry with 3 scopes of whipped cream with sliced fresh strawberries & drizzled with choc sauce served on a flat plate so easy to share & get exactly what you wanted a spoonful of. Have been there before and will go back."}
{"text":"Had a blast here on St. Paddy's day.  Games and people everywhere, never a dull moment!  Super fun!!"}
{"text":"ETREMELY OVERPRICED. And to top it off my lane was broken the entire time we bowled. The staff attempted to fix it but left us on the same lane. There were also blatantly drunk individuals that were interrupting our experience. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND"}
{"text":"I usually love corner alley but tonight our server treated us as if we were an inconvenience to her and was extremely rude. I suggest (coming from someone who works in the service industry) that Brittany the server here find a new job. The second she walked up she was not friendly at all. Won't be coming back for a while."}
{"text":"so we happened upon this place on my first evening in downtown cleveland, ohio. i dunno what it was about this place that made me choose it, but i did, and i apologize for that. the burger that i had was just... two stars. service was good enough, etc. but my food was cripplingly uninspired. mashed potatoes were mega dry, and i've had better meatball burgers on shit-ass white sandwich bread (you called it, eddie).

don't go here to eat...

{"text":"The location by the Hyatt was really convenient for me. Homey feel inside the bar with not overly expensive drinks. Good beer selection, decent variety of Great Lakes."}
{"text":"great food but absolutely awful service. waste of time. we order an appetizer and it came with our food. we ordered fries and it didn't come out until we were all done eating."}
{"text":"Fun and different kind of place, awesome martinis (chocolate is a must try). Bowling was a bit pricey but we had a blast, even dressed \"black tie\" style direct from the TIARA Ball! This place is definitely worth a visit if you are nearby!"}
{"text":"Went here after happy hour with a group of friends. Great atmosphere and bar scene. They got bowling, pool, food, and lots of space. But they weren't cheap either. It was $12 an hour to play pool so we all split it. 

I didn't have any of their food so I have to come back and try it then. Drinks were worth the price, not watered down at all. The decor is nice and it's at a great location downtown. Street parking if you're lucky but parking lot across the street isn't that bad ($5) unless there's an event, it's $10 to park. 

Good place to go with a group of friends since there are things to do. 

My next visit to this place was actually two days later where I met a friend for some food/drinks. We ordered their pepperoni pizza which I've been craving but actually it wasn't that great. Instead of having little slices of pepperoni all over the pizza, it was just a bigger slice of pepperoni for each slice. The pizza itself had plenty of cheese but it was really oily. You could literally see it oozing from the top but because it was $10 for just eight slices and the fact I was hungry, I dealt with it. However, it's a great place to have some drinks and play some bowling/pool/watch sport games."}
{"text":"I had the salmon and loved the sauce on it. Their Cesar salad with pretzel croutons was yummy too!"}
{"text":"I went there last night and it was fine at the beginning the food was decent, there were a lot of people and it had a fun vibe. But as we were leaving my friend went out the rotating door the wrong way and then an employee (idk what position he was) threatened to call the cops and said it in a very harsh and angry voice (he sounded like he actually wanted to fight us outside). All because he went out the door the wrong way. Instead of people getting out in 3 seconds they got out in 5 secs. Oh no. Better get the police involved. And then he stared us down out the building until we turn the corner and he couldn't see us anymore. Really made me and my 3 friends, who are paying customers, feel really unwelcome and uncomfortable. There are better ways to handle that situation. Absolutely never going back. I don't wanna get the cops called on me if I accidentally drop my fork on the ground."}
{"text":"Strait up in the mfn land hoe. At the corner ally goin ham bone  on some cockies , I mean when your in CLE and hit the town you gotta slide in here and watch the CATS on these big Tvs but avoid the bowling guy he's a big swinging Richard ... I can't go ..:"}
{"text":"Some of the grossest food in CLE. It's obvious that the cooks here don't give a crap about what they send out of the kitchen. Save your money and avoid this place. 

My date's steak salad was a hunk of fat spilled on top of iceberg lettuce, and my fish sandwich was somehow burnt to a blackened crisp. I'll never go back."}
{"text":"Our son saw this place and had to try the bowling. You pay by the hour plus shoes. It's by far the nicest bowling alley I've been to and a good way to past time if your spending a couple days here.

We weren't planning on eating but saw the deep fried ho-hos and had to try them. They came out and looked amazing but that's the only good thing I can say about them. They were extremely over-cooked and tasted burnt. The three of us didn't finish one. I guess we shouldn't be eating deep fried ho-hos in the first place."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and drinks with my parents after a beer fest at house of blues. Every other place on east 4th was packed, so this was the only place that didn't have a 30+ minute wait. We should of known better... 

I haven't been here in about two years so I was surprised to see that the place was remodeled. It looked really nice, but that was the only good thing we experienced here. 

We were seated right away. We probably waited about 10 minutes before anyone acknowledged us. We finally ordered drinks which took forever to come, plus we had to remind our server of our order twice.  The food was ok-nothing crazy. It's just average. 

The service was horrible!! We were here for almost two hours. Our server (forget his name) was too busy Bro-ing with his friends and checking out girls walking by instead of accommodating to his tables. However the second we asked for our check he was on top of his game..... Typical. 

Overall Corner Alley better get their stuff together soon or Punch Bowl is going to dominate them."}
{"text":"The Corner Alley is a very well executed bar/bowling alley in a great location.  I've been several times and it's a lot of fun.  Food?  Well, frankly I can't even remember if the food is any good.  I think it's good, but it doesn't really matter.  This place has a cool atmosphere, the bowling is well-integrated with the social/bar scene and the whole thing is well-thought out.

My company has had two events here and Corner Alley pulled off the logistics and catering flawlessly.  (Actually for those events the food was pretty good; the BBQ buffet is the way to go.)  Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a drink and appetizer, real nice place. The bartender was extremely friendly without being annoying. The place was clean and the items were reasonably priced. I didn't bowl, but it was a cool setup. It was basically the opposite of a bowling alley (I say that in a good way), instead of being a place to bowl with a couple of drink and food items, it was a complete restaurant and bar with a few bowling lanes. I got the mozzarella planks (basically mozzarella sticks), they were good, but nothing out of this world. This place could be a 5 star, but since I just stopped in for a quick bite and drink I didn't feel like I experienced enough of the place to rate it that high."}
{"text":"Awful place to go on a Saturday. We bought an hour worth of lane time only to have our lane down for technical issues multiple times. They didn't credit any of the lost time to us and our group could not finish one game in the $50 hour we paid for.

We waited 10 minutes at a time for drinks at the bar and could not beg the waitstaff to serve our lane or even acknowledge our existence, all while"}
{"text":"Very cool bar/ bowling alley that is open on holidays! 

Drinks are strong, and pbr tallboys are only $3! Service is always fast & friendly. Great place to grab a quick drink or hang out with your friends/ coworkers for the evening! 

I would highly recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"Full disclosure: I have never actually bowled here. But in all fairness, Corner Alley is so much more than a bowling alley.  The bar area is second to none on East 4th and it is a lot of fun if there is a big game or event on. There are lots of great TVs, good seating, and a large selection of beers on tap - many of which are from local craft breweries. I have had lunch here and enjoyed it but plan to come back and bowl one night. There are plenty of lanes with lots of seating near by as well as video games for the young ones - or the young at heart!  Definitely a great place to have a few drinks or spend an entire evening."}
{"text":"Stopped last night and found out what lazy success means. The bartender was rude and the drinks were weak. 
Had not been there in a couple of years and at that time the service was wonderful and everything was great.
It now appears it's a money grab for them."}
{"text":"This is an okay place to eat. The atmosphere is great and it's in a nice location. However, service was slow and food was not worth the price we paid for it. But it is not a bad place to eat! If you just got to the city and need a place to just \"grab a bite,\" you can't go wrong here. Bowling is in another section and seems like a really great place to have a party or gathering. The location is also very easy to find."}
{"text":"How is a restaurant half empty and a group of 2 walk in and it's a half hour wait???  Very poor management!!  Many groups of people have walked out does to this, very sad for business."}
{"text":"I decided to give Corner Alley another shot. I'm very happy that I did. Everything was PERFECT! The loaded fries were definitely loaded this time lol. Also, great service as we waited for our take-out order. I'm going to say my previous bad experience might have been due to them just opening... Things can get pretty hectic. I'm happy that's all ok now though. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would. This place is ridiculous. After having made a reservation for 12 people the day before we were to arrive, I check in 10 minutes early to find that NO ONE reserved the lane I was promised!! No record of me even calling. These people were RUDE, UNPROFESSIONAL and this was after having SPENT $172 on their below average food. They said they could \"accommodate me 3 hours later at 11pm\" if I came back. WARNING: Don't even bother to call ahead and make reservations, they will just lose it anyway. I came from California to take my family out and have a nice bowling outing and it was ruined by this circus show they call a bowling alley. Don't waist your money on the food, it's awful."}
{"text":"Staff at the Corner Alley do not seem to enjoy working there or want to be friendly/talkative with guests at the restaurant.  Our waitress did not spend much time at our table other than to take our order, fill our waters, or bring/take the check.

Only 'gluten-free' options are salads, so please don't believe what their website says. Their bourbon sauces and beer queso will contain gluten-free so be careful is you are celiac or gluten sensitive.

As far as being an arcade, I saw about 15 games on their two floor facility. Most looked very used and not well-kept. The woman's bathroom had an unique smell to it, not rancid, just not fresh and clean.

I will not return to this location nor visit their other one in University Circle."}
{"text":"Don't order their burgers. I'm still hungry. For $13 you can probably get more food elsewhere. Frozen burger, 1 piece of cheese and some bbq sauce. The actual burger was  as round as a coffee mug. You could probably place the burger on a slider bun and get away with it being a slider."}
{"text":"Beer served in room temp glass , service no personality they just go through motions 
No interaction with customers at bar"}
{"text":"Everything about this place is \"meh.\" The staff were arguing with each other, it took too long to get draft beers and it's not very clean. After the people on either side of us at the bar left, it was a good 20 minutes before anyone cleared away their receipts, plates and glasses and there was a giant sticky mess all over the bar, that no employees seemed to notice. This place has a lot of potential given the location, but didn't do it for me."}
{"text":"Willing to accommodate even on a busy night
Desperate to find a place to eat on a Saturday evening after a long drive from Chicago, we stumbled upon The Corner Alley. It was top of the seventh during an Indian's home game so parking was hard to come by. We managed to find a spot and walked down Euclid. While super busy, The Corner Alley was still able to seat us right away in front of a TV to watch the last few innings. While the food was average, I was impressed with the service. My BBQ pork sandwich was not as flavorful as I had hoped."}
{"text":"Poor customer service! This location has always had rude staff and you feel like a burden to them! Tried to call 2 weeks ago to reserve bowling lanes for a family get together. Was told to call the week of the date I wanted. I call back when I was told to make the reservation with a rude lady but was happy none the less that it was taken care of. Get a call the next day saying a corporate event is going on and they reserved everything and this lady didn't realize. My sister calls back up and was told we should have called in before them and when she said we tried to tell the man didn't believe her. 

It's a shame that it's a cool spot because I truly never want to go there again because of the multiple poor experiences I've had."}
{"text":"well first off sat at the front table right by the hostess stand and took 20 minutes for a server to even stop at the table. After I went and told the hostess the server came over and was rude. Employees get to run around with attitude and awful customer service, not worth your money. Pass it up. AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!"}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night w a group of dudes. Our server was intensely friendly and chatty, impressed with his own cleverness. But he was nice, so it was okay. 
The food was solid, exactly what you'd expect from a high end bowling alley restaurant.
We graduated from dinner to bowling, which was a lot of fun.
It was really nice to have this fun place right in the middle of downtown"}
{"text":"My husband, son, and myself all went here after the cavs game. It wasn't our place of choice, but with it being a Sunday night and cavs going into overtime our options were limited. Staff was friendly and they warned us ahead of time that service wouldn't be the greatest due to it was busy and there wasn't many servers. Some might find that unprofessional, but we did not. It prepared us. The food wasn't the greatest. We got pulled pork sandwich my husband said it was okay. I thought it wasn't good at all. However we got the loaded fries and they were delicious. Our 7 year old son got a grill cheese that he thought was too cheesy. It did have a lot of cheese, but it was still edible. Fun environment and good atmosphere. Staff nice and would check on us when they got a spare moment. We would return."}
{"text":"We pass this place all the time and always see people on the outside patio enjoying the food and watching a game on the TVs. Stopped in on a Friday night and got a table right facing east 4th. We were seated right away and our waitress was very attentive and friendly. I tried the sausage personal pizza and my boyfriend had the buffalo chicken burger. Food options were pretty standard but both our dishes tasted really good. I liked that there were lots of tables outside and the restaurant was fully open to the street. 
Back area has bowling lanes which we did not explore much. 
Good, easy place to grab a drink and a meal."}
{"text":"I have an issue with the fact that they mix bowling with finger foods - and don't provide wet-naps of any kind ... but Corner Alley is a good time!  There's something nostalgic about going bowling, and they take that activity and mix it with a bar atmosphere.  Not too shabby! 

Food's alright, but if you're planning on a sit down dinner, I'd go somewhere else on East 4th prior, and venture back to Corner Alley for the fun/drinking after!"}
{"text":"Made a reservation for my best friend's birthday and when we got there, we were told our reservation didn't exist and that they were closing (even though it was over an hour and a half before their posted closing time). We ended up going to a different place and what do you know?- we saw the staff members from the bowling alley there, enjoying themselves after having closed the place early. Absolutely ridiculous behavior! They shouldn't be taking reservations if they are not planning to honor them. I've never given a one star review, but this establishment's behavior was truly awful- on friend's birthday no less."}
{"text":"I recently came with a large group of friends to dine and bowl. Our server, Colin, was attentive and fun. He made us feel comfortable and encouraged us to walk around and enjoy the free games. For sports bar style food, I was impressed. I shared a couple of items with a friend, including the fried chicken sliders and the pesto pizza - I definitely recommend both! Though there weren't any notable games on when we were there, this seems like one of the best places downtown to watch a game - huge bar with a bunch of big TVs. Overall, The Corner Alley has a great atmosphere and is a fun place to break the happy hour monotony."}
{"text":"Had dinner there last night. Food was good nice atmosphere and our waiter Ron was great!!!"}
{"text":"In town for one night.  Discovered this place near hotel.  Great atmosphere on a Sunday afternoon for football.  Clean, vibrant and good vibe.
However, the surroundings don't reflect my entire food experience.  Ordered Wild Mushroom pizza.  Menu said it included shitake, oyster, crimini mushrooms.  Mine had local mushrooms only. I mean , one can recognize these type of mushrooms...Questioned bartender, , she replied, \"its very good , you'll enjoy it.\"  I didn't get upset. was with the wife.
Quietly questioned manager.  He replied, \"I'll go punch the guy in the kitchen\" and laughed.
He didn't apologize or buy drinks.  Fifteen dollars for a 9 inch mushroom pizza.  I let it go til now.  They are not ready for prime time.
Three stars for the surroundings and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Service was quick beers and food were cheap for downtown.   Food tasted good!  However - went here for dinner & drinks with a coworker - his first beer there was a piece of gum stuck to the side of his glass - he kindly asked for another glass saying \"I'm not sure what's in this\" and the bartender responded \"you know what it is.\"  Nothing was comped on the bill and we didn't get the sense they really cared. Good place for what it is. Cheap food/beer and sports. Probably won't come back given the unsanitary conditions which reminds me that the floor by the urinals was soaked to the point you could tell you were walking in urine."}
{"text":"This place rocks except for the loser ass negative bartender wearing a hoodie and not offering anything to anyone.  Everyone else here has been gracious and fun except for this dude who clearly missed the grinch earlier.   Talk about ruining the mood with the family and friends.  Is the. DMV hiring because he totally fits.  And btw.  We spent a great deal of money here.  Most of it worth it."}
{"text":"I have been to the Corner Alley for lunch, dinner, drinks and even hosted a surprise party here. It really is a fun atmosphere with lots of tvs and I love what they did with the remodel. It's a lively place it seems like at all times and if it's really busy it can be very loud and hard to hear. I really enjoy their food menu. It's American food, but lots of options! I have had a lot of the sandwiches and salads. I need to still try the pizzas, but I've heard they're really good. They have a good beer menu and some other cocktails. Word of advice is to make reservations here. If there is a big event going on downtown you will often not get a table without one. I'm also thankful for how cooperative they were when I hosted the surprise party here. We had a large table that was by a bunch of tvs so it was a great spot. I now just need to finally go bowling here!"}
{"text":"Well it could be a great sports bar if they could get the tvs to actually work. The manager with the man bun is more concerned about flirting with women than fixing the tvs so his paying customers can watch the Cavs game. If you don't know how to run the AV then maybe you're not qualified to run a bar. PS we live in Cleveland and maybe you should play the local sports team on the one out of five tvs that are hanging instead of the closed caption NBA game from Atlanta? You idiot. I guess our party of 12 will leave and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Went downtown today with  a group of ladies.   Have not bowled in years.   What a fun way to spend a rainy afternoon in  Cleveland.  Chris, who gave us the shoes and the alley, was most friendly and made the day for all of us.   The lanes were great and he even put up the bumpers for us.   Nice staff and great atmosphere .   A bar and food is available, which was reasonably priced ."}
{"text":"I hate to do this but what a terrible experience....

Went to the air show Monday and decided to have some drinks and food after the show. We stopped in to reserve a table of 4 we were told it would be a 15 min wait for first available table. After waiting 30 mins, seeing people walk in and immediately get seated we decided to ask what the hell was going on and coincidentally we were seated next. 

Now I am not exaggerating.... We waited 30 mins for our server to even come over to great us. 
So at this point I went to the bar with my mother to grab drinks and the bar tenders passed us over and over and over again. We were so beyond frustrated at this time watching one specific bartender walk past us over and over until my mom put her arms up for him to notice us (which I'm not sure how he didn't we had been standing there for a few minutes) the bartender had made eye contact and said your next. In which this asshole (Eddie) continued to grab drinks for other people even ASKING THE GUYS IN FRONT OF US IF THEY wanted another drink. I could NOT believe the service!!! My mother turned around so quickly ready to completely ditch the place all together but one of the other people we were with really wanted to stay. 

Our  server finally came over and was very over apologetic (which was nice to hear I'm sorry we messed up but let me try and make things up) and took accountability for not greeting us and a timely fashion, her name was heather (with the purple hair) she was great the rest of our meal. 

Now our food comes, my mothers food was cold (she ordered pulled pork sliders and pram frys, a salad didn't come and my food was cold. I personally couldn't say anything about the food because we all know what can happen about that but my mom did ask our waitress to literally throw them in the micro just to warm them up a bit. 

We paid and got the fuck outta there... People be warned Eddie the bartender... don't ever try to grab his attention because if you do he will intentionally make you wait longer.... 
and ask for heather she really was a great server. 

Don't go the corner ally!!!!"}
{"text":"I enjoy this place. The location is great and the food is pretty good with reasonable prices. The service is ok, but as long as I get my food and it is tasty I am ok. We like coming here with groups because they are usually easy to accommodate and they have a pretty big menu so everyone is happy. 

The last time I was there we ordered waffle fries with caramelized onions, blue cheese and balsamic vinegar...  Wow! So good! And it was a huge serving for the price. Their beer selection is not the best, but they do have a full bar and wine specials for happy hour."}
{"text":"Stopped in at The Corner Alley after Comedy Show at Hilarities.. have passed the CA many times but never ventured in, we stopped and didn't realize it was a bowling alley on one side and sports bar on the other side.. we didn't bowl, but the lanes were pretty crowded with downtown locals, looked like 12 lanes(not sure).. really like the bowling ball wall - looks like something out of Big Lebowski!! We ordered a BBQ chicken Pizza and Fried Chicken Sliders on a Cheddar Jalapeño Biscuit... normally food at a bowling alley is pretty pedestrian, but we enjoyed the pizza($11), especially the crust... the Fried Chicken Sliders had a honey mustard sauce which accompanied well with the Jalapeño Cheddar biscuit ... I recommend both.. we washed it down with an Angry Orchard & Christmas Ale(glass rimmed with cinnamon sugar that kicked it up)... we really enjoyed our late night bite @ CA , definitely not your average bowling alley food that has a great vibe and great service... Check it out..."}
{"text":"We had lunch here recently, and we were just a bit disappointed. The menu is interesting with a little different take on many American classics, but I didn't think it was prepared quite as well as it could have been. For example, the fried pickle chips were just a bit soggy.  The balsamic dressing on my salad was not quite the right flavor for the type salad I ordered-it was an Italian antipasto salad, which they served with a balsamic dressing. It would have been better, I think to serve it with an Italian dressing. Overall, we liked the place, and we'll give it another try some time."}
{"text":"Pro: Pool tables.
Con: They're the big tables, not the regular bar-size tables that are easier and more fun to play on.

Pro: Bowling Lanes.
Con: They get all \"trendy\" with the bowling after dark. It's not real bowing if stuff is glowing in the dark!

Pro: Food.
Con: Food is not very good.

Pro: Drinks. For cheap.
Con: Hmm. Can't think of one here...

Pro: Lots of girls.
Con: They've mostly eaten too much of the not-good food. 

Pro: It's on the corner of Fourth Street, which is apparently the \"happening strip\" in downtown Cleveland.
Con: It's in downtown Cleveland, and the aforementioned strip is a glorified alley with about four restaurants/bars.

Pro: Lots of TVs for sports viewing.
Con: Loud music, some of which is good and some of which is not.

The End."}
{"text":"I had so much fun, great place to go on a date or with a group of friends"}
{"text":"Had dinner here before seeing a concert at the Q. I ordered the white bean sliders and sweet potato fries - delicious! It was way to big and I couldn't take my leftover, which made me sad. Not only was there a concert at the Q but at the House of Blues too. I thought it would take forever to get seat but the kind staff had us seated within 15 minutes. They also allowed us to add to our table a few more friends that met up with us. The food came out fresh and hot. The server was friendly and the place had a nice feel to it. I also seen a few family's there with young children. They have bowling and games available. The beer selection was decent."}
{"text":"This is a cool place to chill and get some beers and food while bowling in the heart of Cleveland. 30 bux for an hour for one lane, no limit on the number of people, pretty good deal. They have waiters taking food and drink orders. I had dessert, s'mores Sunday, it was fantastic."}
{"text":"I had a holiday party here last month. The party was okay.

The food wasn't good at all and we opted for an open bar. Because we're Russian and Irish. Lol! 
I drink top shelf Vodka and they refused to serve me, they would only give me the really cheap stuff. I mean, when you're renting out the space, food and paying for an open bar. I should be able to get top shelf Vodka. 

I had a lot of people complain about that throughout the night. We probably would have stayed longer and spent more money had the food been better and the booze been better. 

We bowled, played a few games. But, in all honesty, this place is more for teenagers and young adults who don't care about cheap booze and garbage bar food. 

Don't think I'll be planning another event here."}
{"text":"Hit up Cleveland for the NCAA Division I Wrestling Championships and St. Patty's weekend. Arrived later on a Thursday night and was happy to see plenty of seats at the bar (before the event at Q let out, then it filled up very quickly). Nice selection of beers on tap, fairly friendly employees (considering we're from Chicago and were wearing Cubs gear - Indians fans, you know you'd do the same here!!) the food was good too, we just had a quick appetizer - the buffalo chicken egg rolls and they were very tasty, crispy on the outside and full of bold flavor. Typical large sports bar, with a bowling alley on one side, which I cannot speak to since we did not bowl. Would come again if I was in town. Cute area!"}
{"text":"Stopped in this east 4th joint for a drink and a quick bite at the bar. Nice clean interior - the renovation over the last year has really spruced up the place. 

They have a small, but good craft beer list. I ordered the columbus ipa and deschutes obsidian stout both of which were tasty and are rated 90+ on beer advocate. Service from bartender was friendly and attentive. 

To absorb the alcohol, I ordered the loaded fries. When it was first served, I was disappointed because it appeared that many of the fries were naked and lonely. Sure, the fries in the middle of the bunch were covered in toppings, but what about the sad, lonely ones on the side? To my delight, you should not judge loaded fries by its' cover. Underneath the bed of fries was a decadent cheese sauce. Once you mix all the fries in this melty, cheesy, gooey delicious sauce, along with the tomatoes and jalapenos, you get the perfect rich, salty comrade to a couple of brews."}
{"text":"Went in with a group during a break at a local cheer competition.  There were 15 of us total.  There was ONE other table that was seated, two people at the bar and ONE lane of 2 people bowling.  Host was great.  Servers were awful.  Food was not of any decent quality and was all cold.  Manager did give me somewhat of a discount, I guess, but didn't take my groupon I had PAID for (the offer was expired, but the value always is redeemable - however, apparently, not here).  Waited 20 minutes after we sat down for a coke and a fruit punch and water.  Had to ask THREE times to get drinks.  Then, waited for over 55 minutes after placing order for food.  ALL food arrived cold, and even after the 55 minute wait time we still didn't get correct orders.  I mean really cold - like it sat for 45 minutes.  Almost every single person in our group had a problem with their order.  Did I mention I got my water as I was walking out after paying the $70 tab for 2 adults and 1 child?  I did get a small discount on my bill but they refused my groupon so it was nothing.  Totally not worth it - filing complaint with BBB and Groupon.  And never going back."}
{"text":"So so... kinda boring. Drinks were pretty average. Food was pretty average. Not the best place to eat drink or bowl but it was tolerable."}
{"text":"Employees don't respect patrons.

I recently visited Cleveland with my wife and was recommended The Corner Alley by friends of mine. We arrived a little later than we had hoped (about 45 minutes until close) but decided we could probably squeeze in a quick game of bowling and possibly some food/drink. We were wrong -- our party (a group of 5) walked through the revolving doors and were instantly met by an employee who told us as COLDLY as I have ever been spoken to: \"get the fuck out.\" I honestly, HONESTLY cannot make this up. The man was so intimidating and confrontational that I felt as if he was attempting to physically assault our party. We tried briefly to ask what the problem was and if we had offended him and he pointed out and yelled (more aggressively this time) to \"GET THE FUCK OUT.\" 

I was so terrified for my, my wife's, and my party's well-being that we left is quickly as we had came in. It wasn't until we finally got outside that we were able to mentally address what had just occurred. They locked the doors behind us (about 40 minutes before close) and to this moment I don't understand what we did to offend that person. We were inside less than 30 seconds! All I can say for sure if that I have never been disrespected so much in my entire life. I will be reporting this establishment to the Better Business Bureau and I suggest that you make ever attempt to find an establishment that respects it's patrons."}
{"text":"Went on a weekday over what I assume was still Winter Break for a lot of Cleveland schools, so the place was pretty busy for an afternoon. I was impressed with how attentive and friendly the hosts were while we were waiting for a lane. It only took 10 or so minutes for one to open up and they immediately cleaned it so it was ready for our group. It's clear that Corner Alley was new, they still had some kinks to work out. One thing I noticed is that they were severely overstaffed, with a bunch of people just standing around.

Pros:
- The atmosphere is fun and clean.
- The arcade games upstairs
- Friendly staff

Cons:
- Food/drinks were fine but overpriced
- Not enough bowling balls of every weight (we had trouble finding smaller weighted balls since a lot of kids were there)
- Not as many lanes as a traditional bowling alley"}
{"text":"The Bartender here was a real jerk; yes the ambiguous flamboyant one.    

I recommend visiting Flannerys or pickwick for drinks and food.  Very disappointed to be treated the way I was as a resident of the street and a frequent customer.  A big thumbs down for service goes to the bar staff as well as the kitchen staff for sending out a raw burger.

Corner Alley is apparently under new management and ownership in 2012 and they arent accepting discount cards, coupons, or previously offered deals.  I think part of the new motto is also to talk down to customers, cut them off, and give them dirty looks."}

Hi -
I would like this to get to the GM and receive a response as soon as possible. I am very disappointed in the service that I received there last night 11/10/14.  My mother and I walked in around 6:00pm.  A woman was on the phone at the host desk and didn't even acknowledge us (I understand she was on the phone, but a simple \"I will be with you in a moment\" would have been great).  We stood there for about 3-5 minutes when another server came over and greeted us and sat us at a table.  We promptly ordered our food and our server was exceptional!  Problem came along when the food arrived.  My brothers sandwich (chicken parm hero) was awful.  Tasted musty and could tell it had been frozen and frozen for a while.  He did not even eat half of the sandwich.  We told our server and we saw her speak with Amber, the manager.  Amber brushed it off and we received our check with the full price of the sandwich on the bill.  We complained again and stated that we didn't feel that we should have to pay full price for something he didn't even eat.  We watched our server walk over to Amber again and she then took $5 off the bill.  We appreciated that.  What I am DISGUSTED with is the fact that once I found out that Amber was the manager, I realized that she was also the woman at the host desk that did not acknowledge us when we walked in.  She also did not even make an effort to come over and apologize for the food and ask if she could replace it with something else or offer some type of apology. I worked in the service industry for 15 years.  This is the WORST customer service experience I have ever had with a \"manager\" of a restaurant.  Please pass this on to management, the owners, etc... If I don't receive a response, I will escalate this further.  I am not looking for anything in return.  I just feel that this should be brought to the GMs attention.  This woman needs some serious customer service training or shouldn't be on the floor.  Thank you for listening.  Roshelle."}
{"text":"Awful. Rude. Unaccommodating. Ridiculously expensive..... The Corner Alley. 

Following a quick dinner at the Greenhouse Tavern, a group of us had reservations for a night of bowling at the nearby Corner Alley. Don't mock us. Our proximity for the night limited us to this area. 

Reservations for bowling were set for 8:30pm, although it was made clear to us that they would hold our alley for 15 minutes past our reservation time before they would give away our alley. Perfect. Because a sit down dinner at GH which began at 7pm would require every bit of the 90 minutes prior to us foraying into our second chapter of the night. 

As 8:30pm neared, the party planning chief in our group gave a courtesy call to the Corner Alley telling them that we are indeed on our way, but would like to take advantage of the buffer time alloted as we finished cashing out at GH. 

By the time we checked in at the Alley, got our shoes, balls, located the lanes, etc. it was already 8:45pm. Too bad. Our hour has started. We were on the clock. You see, the Corner Alley charges $50/hour for a lane. Not per game, but they charge by the hour. They would not let us rent the lane for longer than 1 hour either. Apparently they don't like to accommodate paying customers. When it came down to it, we had just 45 more minutes to chuck as many balls down the lanes for FIFTY FREAKING DOLLARS! That's not even nearly enough time to finish 1 game! Completely ridiculous. 

That was enough to sour the evening alone. I could go on about being kicked off a pool table (that was \"reserved for a private party\"), although no one came within 10' of it the entire evening. God forbid we attempt to have a little fun. I just paid $50 to not bowl for 45 minutes! I could also go on about the overpriced, watered down drinks. Was there even a trace of vodka among the watery pineapple juice? Because I sure as hell couldn't taste it. 

This place screams of an overvalued bad deal. Being nickel-and-dimed to death has a way of sucking any sort of fun out of an evening. If you're ever interested in actually bowling, go to Mahall's Lanes in Lakewood. They charge $3/game. This place charges $50/hour. The Corner Alley doesn't seem to be in the bowling business. They are in the sucking every ignorant soul of as much money as possible business. For you investment? You get nothing but a bad mood in return. 

We couldn't end the night on that note. We needed fun. We needed humor. We needed value. We needed more hambones and hooks. We needed Cadillac Ranch........."}
{"text":"Self seating around the bar tables.  6 of us found a table and asked for a server.  20 min later, no server and the person we asked ignored our repeated request.  

Sorry Charlie!


Update!  6/28/14

Manager personally messaged and apologized for our experience.  Great gesture and appreciated."}
{"text":"Good service but the food was meh. Signature spicy Italian sandwich was terrible. It came with tomatoes and arugula on it but they must've used it from a previous salad because mine also had pieces of Cauliflower on the sandwich. Not good"}
{"text":"The Corner Alley is in a great location and the place has a nice set up with restaurant on one side and bar/bowling lane/pool on the other. Too bad the food did not make up for it. The habanero hot wings weren't bad but burger was mediocre. Overall, below average bar food. You could probably go to Applebee's and get slightly better food. 

Bowling alley is decent but a bit pricey. Just remeber that on fri-sat after 4pm, they charge by the hour. So if for some reason, you have 6 people on one lane (which is their cap), 2 hours tend to go by quickly between taking turn to bowl and having a good conversation. Perhaps a good place for fun and drinks but not for the food."}
{"text":"Well, we were seated 15 minutes passed and no one came over. Awesome. They get zero stars but since that is not an option..."}
{"text":"Honestly, the food we ordered was not up to what we expected. The pizza was burnt and incredibly greasy. 
Also, when I was there, I visited the bathroom. The place was an absolute mess. It didn't look like it had been deep cleaned in a looong time. 
My wife overheard some of the cooks talking about girls they slept with in the last week. Kind of inappropriate for cooks to be talking like that when the kitchen is out in the open like that. 

On a positive note, our service wasn't bad. Our waitress was nice and visited us about every 5-8 minutes."}
{"text":"I gotta say, I really enjoyed chilling at this place. I was there for a private party, so maybe they kicked everything up a bit, but the food and service were both top-notch. They have these crazy good pulled pork sandwiches there that I could have eaten about a dozen of. (Yeah, I ended my sentence with a preposition. Fuckin' deal with it.) I mean, what else is better on a Friday or Saturday night than having a burger, beer and a game of bowling? And if you reply, \"Wine tasting and poetry reading,\" I'm gonna punch you in your hipster-glasses-wearin' face."}
{"text":"Been here for a few Xmas parties thrown by where I work.  Its fun if ya have a private party but if ya just come in Joe Schmoe it blows.  The bartenders are arrogant and slow as hell.  The food is bad and super overpriced.  If your a tourist or just dont know any place else to waste your money its right up your alley.."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars, I would. We sat for 20 minutes without any acknowledgement. We were seated by a hostess and I finally asked a server if we could get drinks. She then moved us to another table and we sat at our new table for another 10 minutes without acknowledgement again. They were not slammed and there were several servers standing around talking to each other. Cool concept with games and a great drink menu, but without any service, it's hard to talk about the experience in any way other than 100% negative."}
{"text":"Waited 20 min for a table while there were dozens open.  We finally got seated and were ignored until we left."}
{"text":"Great waffle fries and beers for your bowling rounds. Don't order anything else, and don't forget to bring your sidearm: this place is sketchy and you may be in for an adventure!!

# security guard slash police officer stands inside the front door with his hand on his gun glaring at you. really?
# expediter sends a trayful of mains to the table to which they had delivered a trayful of apps just 1 minute earlier.
# then they argue with the table's host when he complains, \"really?!\" i'm proud of you, buddy! send it back!!
# host stops a waitress who is in the middle of greeting us and taking our drink orders to say (in front of us) \" this is ryan's table. backoff.\"

then ryan goes to take our order 5 top without writing anything down. 
# i am not surprised that our food arrives not as ordered. missing food, wrong side dishes and more.
# asks me if i still want it, then arrives 20 minutes later (and yes, he still charges me for it)

then table behind us lets it rip with a tazer! my fellow diners say they were pointing it at the table directly, not at anyone. oosh.
maybe that's why they have a police officer at the entry? whoosh!!

{"text":"Came here for a night of bowling with friends.  We arrived slightly late, but because there weren't any reservations until later at night it wasn't a big deal getting a lane.  

Had a one hour reserved bowl which went great until our lane was having some technical issues...the balls were getting jammed and weren't returning.  We let the staff know a couple times and they shut our lane down to fix the issue, making sure to add 20 minutes to our bowl time so we weren't short changed without even having to ask! nice touch.  Our line still had issues, so we let the staff know again.  This time another guy came buy and offered to refund us our $50 1 hour bowl, plus give us enough time to finish our second game..all without even having to ask.  Great customer service.    

The place is great with good music, lots of big TVs to watch sports and a decent bar and food options."}
{"text":"Dang Chicken quesadilla! If you subtract the corn salsa and add a side of ranch, its amazing!"}
{"text":"This joint is actually better than Lucky Strike. OK well, it's not. It's the same, except that Lucky Strike has better food, and this place has way, way better service. The drinks are better at Lucky Strike, but this place has pool tables. 

This place just feels less disjointed that LS, it feels more like a place where people who actually know how to bowl and play pool would not be embarrassed to show up. It's a sports bar that's plenty comfy for your girl and your business pals. 

Do it."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch. Work down the street so it was close by to try something new. It's a bit pricey here. The place was clean and tables were wiped off and not sticky. Fluffy people friendly! so that's a plus. Our waiter was nice, and always checked on us to make sure we had what we needed. I had their grilled chicken sandwich and fries. The sammich came with some weird sauce, it's good, but wasn't expecting it till I bit down and was like, that's not mayo. It was a nice surprise. The fries were crispy and not soggy and didn't seem too greasy. $11 for it. It was small. It wasn't full by the time i left. It was juicy though. My friend had an Autumn salad and it was HUGE. $12 for that thing. She ate it all though. So that says it was good. I also got the soft pretzel sticks to try. I love soft pretzels. $8 for those babies. They were good, but not sure they're worth it. There are lanes in there if you feel like bowling. I priced it when we were there. Thought it'd be fun to take my son there. NOPE, it's $35 an hour for the lane, then shoe rental is $3.50 per person. I asked if we could bring our own shoes, but the girl wasn't sure. I would check out their menu online before you come down here so you know how much money to bring. Check the right menu location for prices. It is downtown, so paid parking or if you're lucky you can find a spot on the street. Overall it was ok, I would go back again, but would need to plan to take more money."}
{"text":"Not impressed by the service. Last two lunch time visits were unimpressive and our waiter rude. We had trouble getting our check to head back to the office. Food was fine but not good enough to warrant another visit. Would still recommend if you're up for some glam bowling you call ahead and make an evening visit."}
{"text":"The Corner Alley is a nice restaurant bar right off of Euclid and 4th street. They have a small outdoor seating area that sits right off of 4th. 

They have a bar menu comparable to any other. Some good apps as well as some hardier restaurant menu items like spaghetti and meatballs. Food was good and so was the service."}
{"text":"So I was going to give two stars but before I left I made a discovery that would keep anyone away from this place. If ZERO stars was an option, I would have chosen that.

First off, seating was immediate. The atmosphere was good. We were seated at a tall table with a four year old. The table was significantly taller than the seats. So my son had to reach up and over to do anything. Asked for a booster seat and they didn't have any available. The lady did try to bring a high chair, but it was about the height of the current seating. 

Ordered brisket nachos, nachos and kids chicken tenders and fries. Drinks, water, Pepsi and kids Chocolate Milk and kids water. 

Food took FOREVER to arrive. When food arrived my sons chicken tenders were basically unable to be cut, they were WAY over cooked. The fries were okay. But he wouldn't eat it.

My brisket nachos were cold. The meat was colder and the flavors just weren't there. It had brisket, cheese sauce, onions, cilantro and BBQ sauce. This BBQ sauce was so sweet, it overpowered everything! I could have dealt with the cold if the taste was there. 

My husbands regular nachos were your basic queso cheese and chips. That I could handle! So we shared his plate. He had a Pepsi and the syrup was low, no biggie, quick fix. 

For the prices you think it would be better. 

So after all that my son wanted to bowl. So we decide to go over. WORST PART! This is why they would get ZERO STARS! I was going to take our sons water with us over and I decided to take the lid off and I went to refill. I looked in and I was SHOCKED! This water looked like they poured it out of last nights dish bus tub. I was so pissed. My son drank half of the water. Now I am having to watch my son to make sure he doesn't get sick. People OPEN YOUR KIDS DRINKS! DO NOT LET THEM DRINK IT BEFORE YOU DO! Please! I asked my husband to take my son over to bowling. I approached two people (man and a woman) who claimed to be management. The man is who seated us. I showed them the water. I was shocked at their lack of concern. The lady \"manager\" did pour the water into a clear cup. Please see pictures. WOW! I almost vomitted! Only thing offered was a new glass of water. Really? 

We already promised our son bowling after he wasn't able to have anything to eat. I wasn't going to let my four year old down. So I meet my husband and son over at the bowling alley, which is right next to bar/food area. 

The bowling alley was your basic bowling alley. But you could tell it was NOT maintained. By the missing pin right out of the gate. See picture. They had one guy running the whole alley. 

For an hour it was $30 something dollars! Holy cow! But they let our son bowl \"free\". No you didn't, I just paid you $30 something dollars! They didn't have my sons shoes size, so I had to go a size down. Also they do not have any children's bowling balls. 

So like I said right out of the gate there was a pin missing.  But hey it's a bowling alley, an expensive bowling alley, but still. But after getting into bowling the seven pin kept getting knocked down by the sweeper (after pins were picked up). So even if it was left standing it get knocked over by sweeper. But we continued. Then the balls started not returning. We mentioned it to the guy. The pins started acting out. So he went back and whatever he did just messed it up. One game and about three frames of a second game in, we decided we had enough. Told the guy to forget it. The lane next to us was having same issue with ball return. We tried to make the best of it for our four year old but he was even fed up. 

I see the two same managers before leaving and talked to the guy. I told him that they need to get the place together. If you guys value your kids, avoid this place or be very observant of their food and water/drink here. Ask for it in a clear cup and an empty cup. Please, please, please!"}
{"text":"Time for an update. I'm a regular here for lunch because it's really close to my office, but I wouldn't be coming back if the food weren't good. It has greatly improved in the last year or so, and I actually have a chance at finding something healthy now. They have several nice salads, but the homemade pierogi are solid if I'm not in the mood for healthy. I'm still underwhelmed by their happy hour, though, and lunch service could use some speeding up."}
{"text":"Meh. Very similar experiences on two visits. 
- 30 minute waits despite tons of open tables, meaning they are chronically understaffed. No reason to have a big space if you can't use it. A sports bar that can't handle game day is embarrassing.
-  Flippant servers. One didn't know the drink special painted on the wall. One replied to whether they had any dry ciders with \"I don't drink cider\". Both with sass.
- interesting veggie burger but apparently assembled by someone who never tried it. It's an herby white bean patty. With coleslaw? And avocado spread? Those things do not match and they taste pretty gross together. Vegetarian doesn't mean putting all your veggie condiments on a bun and calling it a day. Lost potential there. 

Also small things like 30+ minute wait for food. And that they brought the kid's meal with the adult meals - a small thing but it's Service 101 to fire and serve kid's food ASAP, or at least offer to do so. Especially when the kitchen is taking forever. An because the food took so long we needed it boxed right away to go, so she brought me a pizza box for my burger because \"that's all I can find\".  Kewl. C- for effort overall."}
{"text":"My wife and I only had a beer here on our last stop in Cleveland. Great patio outside on the alley with Michael Symon's BBQ place. 

Great place to hang out on a beautiful day and our waitress was very nice. I got a couple of beers and we were off to Minneapolis.

I did walk around, and there is a cool bowling alley and bar to add to the accouterments.

Good times."}
{"text":"I had the meatloaf - huge portion, wrapped in bacon - firm and very good.
Yukon gold smashed potatoes were good but kind of weird.  Tasted like they were flavored with cheesy popcorn salt - good, but fake.
Cole slaw was creamy and I believe homemade - good.
My friend had the fish and chips.  Both looked like standard frozen fare."}
{"text":"Terrible lanes. Cheap furniture. Expensive drinks. Lazy employees. No air conditioning. 

This place has fallen so far. I get that there's more competition than ever, but cramming arcade consoles into an already tight space isn't going to help. What used to be such a unique and fun venue is now a bland, fake and dirty establishment. The renovations took with it any charm this place had. 

On several occasions, I saw multiple employees hiding in the corner of the private bar when we were told by the host that there was suppose to be lane service, but there never was. Seriously, not one person came to offer food, drinks, anything.  This left us to go to the one open bar, waiting for drinks and wasting time on the bowling we paid for. 

And to top it all off, a hot August Saturday night, and no air conditioning. Unacceptable. 

I had only great experiences here in the past, leading me to recommend it for my brother's bachelor party. I would come to seriously regret that decision. What a shame."}
{"text":"Came over for drinks and appetizers with my wife. The beer selection is somewhat pedestrian, but voluminous, so we were able to find something to drink, even if it's the same drinks everywhere else.

We got pizza and a salad. Both came promptly. The pizza is very thin and a little floppy, though still tasted pretty good.

Overall, it's a decent joint to hang out and drink if you have no real expectations."}
{"text":"Great time! A little pricey for drinks but the manager gave us a free game and it was an awesome time."}
{"text":"9:30 PM on a Wednesday night, a couple comrades and I had about 45 minutes to spare and were looking for a quick bite. 
Pickwick: Kitchen, already closed. 
Wonder bar: chef out sick. 
I wished that one of the food trucks would appear like a mirage. 
So, we headed here and were pleasantly surprised. The food isn't exquisite but it's solid. A pulled pork sandwich, slightly sweet. Topped with mayo-based cole slaw for under $10, not bad at all, nothing to write home about.
 
However, the server at the corner alley that night was Ron, and he was great at his job. Very affable [for me, it's a fine line between very outgoing and affable and a sever being very annoying] - Ron didn't cross this line. He was knowledgeable about the beer and food menus, attentive to us on a dead night, offered and recommended to both of my comrades, who both ordered philly cheesesteaks, a few different types of shredded cheeses off-menu instead of the listed cheese sauce, cool. This place isn't always on my short list if I want great food, but kudos for the great service."}
{"text":"Honestly my favorite place to eat lunch in downtown Cleveland. The staff is cool. The menu is good with very solid lunch time choices. And the prices are fair. What more can ask for. My only gripe would be they took my favorite meal off the menu a while back ( fried chicken & mashed potatoes so effing good) but I have found other things ( the mahi mahi sandwich is great, the black and blue substituted with a chicken breast) give it a try you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My company rented out The Corner Alley for a corporate event we were having.  What a fun place!  They set up a full on buffet filled with such items as pizza, sliders, shrimp, mashed potatoes, sweet potato fries, etc.  They also made themed drinks for us, which packed a punch and were quite tasty.

As someone who isn't really a huge bowler, I appreciated that The Corner Alley had a large bowling section, but also had room for those that weren't really paying attention to the game to socialize.  The Corner Alley was definitely a fun spot for an outsider of Cleveland to visit!"}
{"text":"We stopped here for dinner after the 4:10 Indians Game and were greeted by a hostess quite unlike any other I have experienced.  No response to my \"Hi\", no smile, no greeting of any kind.  After I asked for a table for 2 in this overly loud place she seated us, slapped the menus on the table and left.  And then things looked up because our waiter J.D arrived very quickly and with his smile and efficient manner erased all the bad vibes.  Cod sandwich and burger were quite good; fries were medicore but service was exceptionally good."}
{"text":"Understand place was busy due to Indians game, but more than an hour for a simple sandwich is not acceptable. When food finally came, the side dish was wrong. Overall, slightly above average food with dramatically substandard service. Will not repeat."}
{"text":"We Went after work, ordered food and drinks.  The food was just OK.  Ordered the cheese steak and my co worker ordered wings, artichoke dip.  We were starving and the food took forever to come out (30 minutes).  As the crowd grew we switched to a take instead of the bar.  Our waitress was slow and rarely came back and it seemed to be a problem that we had already started a tab at the bar.  Well, that was a mess and in the end...I was over charges for food and drinks I didn't ordered.  I  probably will not go there any time soon. The manager had a bad attitude when we asked him to fix our bill.  Smh"}
{"text":"Stopped here en route to find further evidence of Kingage in Cleveland for Game 5. Originally went to Barrio but that place was packed tighter than a drum. So we retreated down the alley and stopped here based on a recommendation from a member of our party. 

Essentially this is a sports bar with arcades and a built-in bowling alley (10 lanes). From the reviews originally I noticed there were issues but the menu looked extensive and there is a motley beer and spirit list. So what the hell we ordered a couple appetizers and beverages. 

Appetizers we went with were the buffalo chicken egg rolls- decent flavor - comes with a runny type of bleu cheese, and buffalo sauce garnish. 

I went with a grilled chicken sandwich - comes with LTO and some garlic aioli on top. Also, added sweet potato fries to try to liven things up. There is NOTHING to dip these in. Ketchup? That won't work. Mustard? Why. They should look into syrup or cream cheese or something? Man man. 

Well, the chicken breast was the size of my thumb (see photo). About as satisfying as a shower without soap. Very disappointing. 

Overall - cool spot, fun place for beer and apps and to bowl etc. But food? Average at best."}
{"text":"My fiance and I went here with a group of about ten people for a birthday party.  We rented a lane for an hour and with shoe rental it ended up costing about $20 per couple.  It was bowling in the the middle of downtown Cleveland, and the novelty of that was a lot of fun.  The servers were attentive and the peps who were drinking got regular refills. They ran out of the men's size 10 shoe and my fiance had to get another size, but that was really the only con.  They had plenty of bowling balls of all weights and colors. (I chose the neon green 6 pound because I am a light weight, and if I hurt my wrist then there is no working the next day.)  There was plenty of space between allys to allow for my group to not infringe upon the group next to us.  It was busy in there, but it didn't seem over crowded.  Overall, the lanes were not ultra special, it was just a bowling ally.  It's location seems to be the big draw.  However, I didn't eat there, so maybe the food is ultra special?  

I had always looked at this place and really wanted to go in, so I'm really glad that I had the chance.  I did have a great time bowling, but if you don't already like to bowl, then this place isn't going to change your mind."}
{"text":"Rude waitress. Was trying to correlate something with the bartenders and managers but one waitress ruined the entire night."}
{"text":"Yeah, never again. I am still grossed out. First,and LAST time!!!
     First, let me say, the bugs and gnats on the inside on the window sill made it very hard to wanna eat at all. This place hasn't been cleaned in a long time. 
      Secondly, our food took forever. Forever to make and forever to get brought out. I kept looking to see where our server was, nowhere to be found? The food sat for a good 10 minutes before we got it. The cooks did not look at all like they cared about their jobs. 
         Finally, we get our food,and my order was completely wrong. I ordered a sandwich with mozzarella,tomato,no basil,no pesto,add roasted peppers. Came out burnt, with what appeared to be basil,but a closer look determined it was spinach?!??? I'm still baffled?! The waitress was very apologetic,and nice. You could tell she was not thrilled with the way things were run. It took another 20 minutes to get a manager to take the sandwich off the bill. He was nowhere to be found. Needless to say, I'd find another place to eat when in the area again!"}
{"text":"Definitely a unique and cool place to hang out with a group.  We went with a large group.  The food they served were chicken tenders, quesadillas, sliders, veggies and dipping sauces.  Food was mediocre.  Obviously since it's a bowling alley it's loud.  Not really a date spot but would be good for a group.  Service was good."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go to the Corner Alley literally for years. Now I'm kicking myself that it took me so long to get here because this is by far the best bowling alley I've ever been to! 

The local bowling alleys that I go to are normally super dark, old and not very welcoming. I didn't know bowling could be any different until I went to The Corner Alley! This is a super modern and hip place that offers more than just the sport, although the bowling aspect was also really great! On a side note, the bowling balls even looked like pool balls (can you say cute photo op?)! After a couple games, I checked out their really cool bar that serves all kinds of fun drinks. The craft beer I got was in a tower so big that I had to split it with three other people! I went to the Corner Alley initially for a networking event, so they had all kinds of little appetizers to try. I had the hummus with veggies and the vegetable flatbread? pizza, both were a welcomed treat from the normal greasy foods that you get at typical bowling alleys. I love that guests can also play their own music over the Corner Alley speakers through an app on their phone! It definitely? helps everyone to get in the \"bowling zone,\" if that's a thing. 

I had an amazing experience at The Corner Alley! I came for the bowling, but stayed for the modern bar, groovy music, tasty food and overall fun atmosphere that really helped to redefine bowling for? me. I'll definitely? be coming back here soon!"}
{"text":"The worst service i have ever experienced. Literally sat for over 25 minutes with no acknowledgement from a server, let alone anyone to take our food and drink orders. Unacceptable. Never coming back and i recommend no one else come here on a busy day. They clearly cannot handle a crowd."}
{"text":"I was able to finally take in the improvements of the most recent renovations to the place. It's defintely more lively in the bar area. Lots of TVs, cool visual setup with the bottles up high behind the bar and ample seating at the bar counter. Patio garage-style doors were closed due to the weather, but I can only imagine it adding to the experience in a positive way. No food this time around, but the bartender did not mind at all. He was personable and a good conversationalist as I waited for my friends to arrive."}
{"text":"Came here to hang out with a friend for a medical school mixer.  The place is nice, trendy, lively and loud.  Bowling mixed with drinking seems only natural, except this place makes it more upscale.  Coming from a Californian, the style and prices  compare pretty evenly to some of the stylish and lavish bowling alleys that have been around in my area for awhile.   The drink prices are comparable to upscale bar or nightclub levels which is always a turnoff but it's probably one of their main money makers.  Nothing here really set this place apart from other similar places I've been to and that's what made this place 3 stars for me.  Service was average, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.  

Pros: Bowling, drinking, food? Sure why not.  

Cons:  Pricey.  

Overall: it's not a place I would come to often if I lived in the city.  Additionally If I travel back to the area I probably wouldn't come back here unless there was absolutely nothing else to do.  I'd rather just go bar hopping or drink somewhere else with friends.   Drinks are cheaper elsewhere and spending time with friends is what matters more to me.  If you're looking for something active to do though, sure why not."}
{"text":"Great place to eat and our server Rhonda provided excellent service and really made it a great experience."}
{"text":"Ready to bowl? Visit here for again time playing, eating, drinking and spending time with friends or family. After the renovator, this establishment has opened up more and is visually stimulating with the new decor.

While you are bowling, you will have your own waiter who will get all of your needs met. It can be rather loud in the back, but you are bowling.

This is a great place to also watch games or stop in for a bite to eat or drink before a big game. Easy access to other locations on East 4 and also has nice outdoor seating that is around the perimeter. Decent food, but you can find something to eat that will meet your desire, enjoy!

Helpful: restrooms are downstairs, take the stairs if you are bowling!"}
{"text":"Had to edit my review...not to many business watch or respond to Yelp reviews so I want to thank Corner Alley's Manager Micheal for caring enough to reach back out to me! So my coworker and I went back and had a very pleasant experience. I had wings fries and sprite and my coworker had a pizza. The wings were great and the fries were perfect and the way my coworker threw down on an whole pizza I am guessing he approved! The person waiting on us was EXCEPTIONAL and very attentive to our table you could tell that she is a seasoned pro. I highly recommend that if you are in or near E. 4th that you stop by Corner Alley I know I will!!"}
{"text":"This place was absolutely awful! My wife ordered the chicken sliders and sent it back since she asked for no honey mustard. It came back out wrong again and had no honey mustard and no coleslaw. Not a good experience!"}
{"text":"A bowling alley in the middle of downtown?  Really?  

As they were building this place, my friends and I walked by each day guessing what business was going in.  One day, I saw them installing the bowling pin machines and I guessed that  it was going to be a bowling alley.  I guessed right.

The food is pretty good and the atmosphere is terrific.  The service is also good.  

What's unique is that not only is it a bowling alley that serves food, but it's a bowling alley that's a full restaurant, including wait staff.  I've seen quite a few catered corporate parties here.  

I'm looking forward to some after-work parties here."}
{"text":"Spent a night in Cleveland. Stopped in for bar food and some drinks. Had the  burger and sliders. Nothing to rave about. It's your typical bar food with bar scene. Enjoyed it."}
{"text":"For a place that takes on the task of being both a restaurant and a bowling alley, the Corner Alley seems to do both only moderately well. I didn't see anyone bowling, nor was I very impressed with the food. The service wasn't very good, but then again, our waiter was dressed in a bowling shirt, so that gave an immediate and accurate indication of the restaurant experience that is to be had at the Corner Alley.

Why does this place have a revolving door?"}
{"text":"I apologize in advance for any ranting that may occur in this review, but eating here was one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had.

The restaurant seemed to have it's usual Friday night  crowd, but our group was more than happy to wait for a table. Once we sat down, we placed our order for food and drinks. 

Shortly after placing our order, our sever returned back to our table asking if she had dropped off the check yet. With a puzzled look, we told her that our appetizers hadn't arrived yet. She than walked away a little confused. 

A while later,  a room temperature set of appetizers arrived at our table and then our main courses a few seconds after. We told our server that we were no longer interested in the appetizers due to their temperature and timing. Instead of apologizing, she said under her breath as she took the food away \"it's busy, okay?! \". Our main courses were unremarkable. 

We tried to overlook this comment and then spoke to the manager on duty about our issue, who was trying to be as helpful as he could. 

After finishing our meal, our server came back and dropped off the check. For the inconvenience we dealt with and the rude behavior of our server,  the manager comped the appetizers we never were able to enjoy. We didn't think this was nearly enough, but we decided to just pay the bill to end the suffering. When the server returned to the table to collect the tipless cash payment we left (adjusting for drink charges on the bill that we never actually received or ordered) the server confronted us about the adjustment and told us to \"have a shitty night\". 

That's when things got hostile and we sought out the manager. We were obviously very upset and told him what our server just said to us. 

As horrible as our experience was, our manager did what he could and appeased our concerns. 

Our review of our experience, in my opinion, is more than justified, but due to our manager's willingness to help, we told him we would try the place again in the future. He had indicated to us that he was recently moved to this specific location and was dropped in the restaurant at a time when our experience was not unique. Hopefully an updated /more positive review to come in the future."}
{"text":"Best happy hour downtown. Huge draft beer selection and tasty sandwiches. Bartenders stay busy, but are attentive and prompt. Only one serious issue....dozens of Panhandlers are aggressive and annoying at 4th and Euclid."}
{"text":"Corner alley is convenient, quick, and their service was great!  The food is okay, nothing to write home about, and their drinks are overpriced.  I had a large party and asked to him my bar bill transferred to the table - the bar staff refused, but the manager quickly accomodated, which was very helpful.  With all of the options downtown, Corner Alley needs to differentiate themselves more."}
{"text":"I've been here for lunch on a weekday twice now and this place gets the job done without any extra perks. The service has been relatively slow and my table practically had to beg to get refills on our drinks. The food is forgettable. They simply have a nice location and I'm sure bowling is fun!"}
{"text":"The drinks are great with a lot of great options. The food was mediocre at best but I suppose the food isn't meant to be in the spotlight. The wait times are also crazy for bowling on weekends and if you don't have a reservation then don't expect to be playing anytime soon. Our waitress was extremely nice though and did everything she could to help us."}
{"text":"It took a bit of time to get started bowling because the cashier wasn't able to work her computer terminal with any level of competency. It took her the assistance of another person and quite some time to just to split the lane fee up evenly between a few credit cards. She said she was newer, but you'd think how to accept payment would be high on the list of training skills. 

I had a fun bowling experience, but that was really because of my friends and not because of any effort on the part of Corner Alley. We had lane #5 which allows for a bit extra space by the lane because between lane 4 and 5 is dead space / ceiling columns. The same happens between 8 and 9 so I would recommend choosing those lanes if the place is busy.  

There was a menu lying around by the lane and soon after getting started with the game a waitress came over to take F&B orders. We got a beer pitcher and the garlic parm fries, which I thought were good and not too oily.  

The service was good, but just bare bones - nothing above and beyond. The server didn't offer drink refills which was a bit odd as we bowled for two hours and all the glasses and pitcher were empty before that point. She even provided the check before seeing if another pitcher was wanted. When she brought over the fries she didn't ask if any condiments were wanted and when one person in our group requested a water, she didn't ask if anyone else wanted one. Just little things like that were missed that could have made a difference in opinion and actually could have caused us to spend more money. 

I have to say since the redesign of the space Corner Alley is much more attractive and welcoming from the exterior, but the bowling lanes are quite bright with all the windows now. The atmosphere was vary spacious and there were a lot of TVs, some located above the pins at the end of each lane. The audio in the space was coming from a TV playing a live local sports game. I only noticed this really because the commercials were piped through the lanes at full volume. That just seemed odd to me. I would probably have the TVs on silent, except at the bar, and have music by the lanes. The Sunday bowling crowd consisted of a few groups with children, not big groups seemingly into sports.  

I went on a Sunday before 5p so the hourly lane rate was $27 with tax. Shoes are $3.50 for however many hours you bowl. The prices vary by day and time so check the website for that info.

Assigning a star value to this place is hard because there are so many aspects to it. I would without a doubt come here to bowl again, but I would choose Corner Alley to bowl, not for any other reason. And my expectations would not be really much higher than they are for any other, decade older local alley."}
{"text":"We went there for a late night bite and beer  I order a grilled chicken sandwich with a bartender, she was very nice but when my sandwich came I took a bite and it was a grilled cheese with bacon.  I called over the other bartender who argued with me and told me he heard me say grilled cheese.  My husband advised him that he did not take my order but he continued to argue that he heard what I said and I definitely ordered grilled cheese.  I absolutely did not order grilled cheeses but instead of apologizing and stating it was a misunderstanding he was rude and arrogant telling me what I ordered. He put in the other order although I told him to forget it   The sandwich came and it was too late. My husband paid and left a tip but we left the food and beer on the table and left.  Horrible service horrible food but do not ever go to that bar. Do many more options in Cleveland.  Leave this place out so many better options around."}
{"text":"Good local happy hour joint.  We enjoyed a couple beers here.  The 'Sweet Baby Jesus' was the best we had.  This is definitely a locals hang out place, middle of the road experience."}
{"text":"This modern Bowling alley was located right across the street from the hotel I stayed at for a weekend. It has a nice bar like atmosphere and friendly staff. Sunday was a good deal as it was \"ladys night\" and they didnt charge my wife the shoe rental fee."}
{"text":"I was in cleveland this past weekend for a wedding and my boyfriend and I met some friends here.  From the minute we walked in the door no one was friendly. We proceeded to get a drink and food from the bar  I ordered a captain and coke and my boyfriend ordered a  tall pabst.  I watched her pour my drink it was not even a full shot and tasted like nothing but coke. My boyfriend wanted a tall PBR but the bartender said she had no clean tall glasses, and poured him a small one. Well as I looked around the place was a wreck.  Dirty dishes all over and workers standing around.  We ordered a pizza, paid our tab and went to play pool.  I didn't say anything about my drink being weak, I wanted to see if it would be the same thing if I ordered from the waitress.  So I did and it was just as bad.  My boyfriend and I went to the bar to say something.  I am in the industry and I get that they were busy but the attitude I received from the bartender when I brought up the lack of captain morgan in my coke, she grab a shot glass poured a shot, slammed it on the bar and slid it to me and walked away.  We were so frustrated after that that we canceled our food order, got our money back for the food and asked to speak with the manager.  By the time the manager came around I just wanted to leave.  When she eventually did come around and asked what we wanted, she had  just as much attitude as the bartender.  We didn't want anything for free I was simply making her aware of the staff she has.  I didn't tip her and do not feel bad about this.  I usually tip 40%, as being in the industry, but felt she didn't work for it.  This situation was not a loss for us, we still enjoyed our friends but took our business elsewhere .  If you want bad service and rude workers, go there.... or if you want great service go to the Chocolate bar across the street!"}
{"text":"This place is great for entertainment. Its a bowling alley / sports bar I mean there's not much else you could ask for. The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because their food is mediocre at best but no one comes for the food. They have an extensive draft list and a nice selection of other alcohols. Giles and Jen(bartender) and Dustin(bartender) are my favorites. I receive excellent service from them every time. This is my go to place for some nice entertainment or girls night out."}
{"text":"Recently remodeled. Now it feels industrial with high ceilings, wood floors, high tables. We went at happy hour. Good prices on beer, wine, and a selection of specialty drinks, and apps. Our variety of food was very good. Service was good. Room was very loud, and it wasn't very crowded. I'd go again in warmer weather, and sit on the patio."}
{"text":"Went in during the end of the Browns game last week. It was so loud that our waitress had to ask us to repeat everything we said. Not enjoyable. I understand that games are loud but this was painful, unfortunately we had limited time and couldn't leave to find a new restaurant. 
We started with shrimp egg rolls and chicken tenders. The egg rolls were sitting in soy sauce when they arrived - soggy. Gross. The chicken flavor was good however the breading fell of the minute we cut through it. Disappointing but not the end of the world. 
For our meals we ordered a prime rib dip and club sandwich. The prime rib dip sandwich was cold in the middle and the dip was soy sauce with loads of Rosemary floating around. The bacon on the club was awful - fatty, cold and unappealing. I never leave bacon on a plate, but this time I had to. Ordered a miller lite draft and had bugs in it - sent it back for a bottled beer. No apologies from the staff, the waitress even seemed bothered. 

At the end the waitress dropped the check and it took 20 minutes for her to pick it back up. Took 10 minutes for a refill on iced tea.  While we waited for the waitress to pick of the check, clearly ready to be taken to the register, the general manager stood by our table and watched the game. Never once did he stop by - especially surprising since he was the one the server went to with the beer with bugs in it. 

Horrible experience even worse food. Avoid!"}
{"text":"The food is well-designed, but poorly executed. It arrived cold and overdone.  Service was slow and drinks were inconsistent. The first one I had was weak and the second so strong I ordered a soft drink to dilute it. Waitress informed us they were out of pizza dough, and considering that was 1/3 of the menu,it reduced our choices a lot. Something else a member of our party ordered was also out. Later while bowling, bar service was practically non-existent. When I was finally able to order a rum and coke, it arrived made with Captain Morgan, which I don't like. Bar rail Bacardi would have been fine, but spiced rum is not what I would serve anyone unless they requested it. Go there to bowl, but eat and drink elsewhere."}
