{"text":"Been many times and everyone was the same, they're always out of anything we ask for. Today out of the four desserts they offer they only had one. I got so frustrated today I didn't even order, but my male friend did, and it was really bad. He didn't eat even eat it. Not any did they not take his order off they didn't even discount it. It's bad enough the service is slow. Never going back"}
{"text":"Do not let the appearance or location of this place discourage you from paying a visit. We have lived in the area for several years, but have never tried it and tonight we gave it a shot. The food exceeded expectations, and the service was honestly the best service we've had dining out in years. My daughter wanted something that wasn't on the menu, and they happily and quickly accommodated by fixing what she wanted, per her very picky instructions! The portions were generous, and the food fresh. A few minutes after we ordered the cook came to our table to confirm the special order and to suggest an unusual combination with my dish, which was a pasta creation with a cream and cheese sauce. It was not what I normally eat at a Mexican restaurant, and definitely not something I normally order but I figured what the heck if he suggesting yet I will try it. It was amazing. Our server was very sweet, attentive and accommodating. I did not have high expectations for this place, but they honestly have a lot to offer and the service alone is enough for me to return. Prices are very reasonable and the sanitation grade is a 95. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I traveled here on accident one day - the place I was originally trying to go visit was not open. So I popped into this in descript location. The parking lot is raggedy, the restaurant sits alone and all the times I had driven past - it never looked busy. But for some reason, I didn't let these deter me. And so glad I didn't.  The restaurant itself is pretty big. I walked in and went up to the bar. Of course, they spoke to me in Spanish but once I told them I didn't speak, they spoke English. On my first visit, I was looking for pupusas. The variety is not as big if you go to a pupuseria but they have a few different option. I always go with the chicharrones con queso which they definitely have. My order took a while. Which is good - means they make their pupusas fresh and it shouldn't be any other way. My food came out piping out. I asked for extra curtido and tomato sauce and they happily obliged with no problem.  On my second visit, it was again for pupusas and this time I ordered the menudo. I prefer my menudo without hominy and they serve theirs without. The tripe was tender and the broth flavorful, but a little on the greasy side.  I really like this place and look forward to going back and trying more of their menu options."}
