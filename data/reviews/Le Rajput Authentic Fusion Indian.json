{"text":"They give you a poppadom.  This was a little thinner than the ones I've had before and still had some oil glistening on the top.   I tried the Balti with lamb - onions, capsicums, tomatoes, and coriander and naan.  They brought out a free samosa with my meal.  I'm not sure if this will be standard or is a gimmick since they are new.  Overall it was ok, though I don't think their version of hot is the same as my version of hot."}
{"text":"They have a $9.95 buffet for lunch weekdays. Quality of food was good, tasty although on the mild side.  The place is nice with large windows on Prince-Arthur. Service was attentive and nice which is especially noteworthy for a buffet. Their a-la carte menu is interesting with some typical western fare adapted with Indian ingredients such as the \"Tandoori Club Sandwich\" and the \"Kebab Burger with mint-tamarind chutney\". Worth visiting is you are around."}
{"text":"I completely understand that this place closed shorty after its opening.  It was the worst Indian food I've had in Canada.   Flavourless."}
