{"text":"Excellent selection for lunch and dinner.  Sushi melts in your mouth.  I have had high quality sushi before.  Once you tried good stuff, you know the real thing.  This is definitely the real thing!  I will be back my friends and family!"}
{"text":"I have been going to niji for a few years now ,I have had a lot of great  experiences  With this familly owned and operated  restaurent -they are wonderful people, very caring and  generous (portions are above average ) only problem is the line up to the door so if you can't wait better to come of peak hours or order takeout-  for quality and quantity and price I would rate it the best in Toronto :)"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a hidden gem in Scarborough. I love the freshness, selection and affordability of the food, the friendliness of the staff and the warm and personable atmosphere. My husband and I have been faithful patrons of Ni Ji since they had opened and we have yet to experience any of the \"concerns\" other reviewers had mentioned (some of those reviews are just downright absurd), but I digress. We have dined at other sushi restaurants (mostly in the downtown core and the Beach area) and have found none comparable to Ni Ji. Keep up the amazing work! :-)"}
{"text":"I ordered the salmon sashimi, red dragon maki and the beef bento box.  The food was fresh and delicious.  The server was also very attentive and genuinely enjoyed working there.  Will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place for sushi!   Service is very quick and the portions are huge. Most meals come with a salad, soup and appetizer. The tea is a very nice compliment to the meal.  I usually get one of the 3 sashimi sets and they are always excellent.  We've also been here with a party of 10 and they were very accommodating.  Call for a reservation to be safe since there aren't many large tables"}
{"text":"always hits the spot. Fast, tasty and fresh. Probably the best Korean run sushi place in scarborough. It is absolutely no ZEN but good cheap food and excellent service. Their menu is also huge. Also their Japache they give with every bento box is down right addictive. I could really do without the congee but people like it. On par with Sushi One in North York. (there is a reason it is always packed)"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Saturday evening and the restaurant was busy! This place must be a local favourite.   We ordered a small sushi dinner and unagi donburi, each came with miso soup, salad and a congee (or a congee-like side). The food was pretty good and fresh, and prices were reasonable for portion sizes.   Service was quick and friendly, and we didn't have to wait long for food either. Not bad!"}
{"text":"NiJi Sushi is our neighbourhood go-to place for Korean and Japanese food.  The stone bowl bi bim bop is delicious, and the sushi is great too!  The Korean appetizers, and the green tea ice cream come free of charge - and are a welcome treat!  The restaurant is nothing fancy - but has a homey, welcoming, neighbourhood feel.  The staff are happy and friendly, and the service is great!  I like that they're open late - even in the burbs!    We love Niji Sushi!"}
{"text":"Really surprised they were so busy, their rolls were average at best. Really really small for what they charge and no meat inside. Thinnest I've ever see salmon sliced. And the green dragon had essence of eel."}
{"text":"Been looking for a simple, unpretentious and good quality sushi and sashimi. This place exceeds my expectation. I had the spicy salmon sushi and green dragon rolls. Generous portions. Service was quick and attentive. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this restaurant for almost eight years now and I still love it as much as the first time I ate here. The prices are very reasonable and the food is delicious! I agree that the service here isn't the best sometimes, but I don't mind as long as the food gets to the table. The kitchen offers both Japanese and Korean dishes and the sushi here is fresh and great tasting. I haven't been able to find a better tasting spicy tuna or spicy salmon roll anywhere in Toronto. Their sushi pizza is also one of the best I've tasted.   For those not keen on sushi, I absolutely recommend the galbi. It's served on a hot plate on top of a bed of onions. The meat is succulent and packed with flavour. The salmon teriyaki dinner is also one of my favourites. The portion of salmon given is huge. It's served on a hot plate so I recommend you ask for the salmon to be cooked to a medium doneness as it has a tendency to dry out otherwise.   My least favourite item on the menu is the chicken teriyaki. The flavours are bland and the portion small. I've tried this dish a few times and each time has been a very underwhelming experience for my taste buds. As super cool ski instructor would say, \"if you order the chicken teriyaki, you're gonna have a bad time.\"  All bento boxes and entrees include edamame, congee, salad, miso soup, spicy seaweed, cold glass noodles, and either ice cream or half an orange for dessert! It's truly unbelievable and adds such a great value to an already reasonably priced meal. Although I have recently moved downtown I regularly make my way to Scarborough just to eat here. You absolutely have to check this place out!"}
{"text":"This place is the best combo of cheap and delicious that I've found in Scarborough. I've only ever ordered take out, and they are rocket fast with their prep skills. Plus, you get a discount when you pay cash! Love it."}
{"text":"Had the eel bento box and black dragon roll. When you dine in they serve you lots of appetizers, salads etc. which are really good. Everything is top notch. I've gone here lots of times."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Scarborough by a long shot. Great staff, all very nice.. great prices too! Been going here for years."}
{"text":"Decided to bring my Mom here for her be-lated Mother's Day meal with my gf. We came kind of late for lunch, close to 2pm. The menu is quite extensive with a bit of Korean influence as well. We stuck with Japanese only this time!  My gf got the lunch combo of california roll, veggie tempura, chicken teriyaki, jap chae noodles in a bento box.  My Mom got the sashimi lunch consisting of tuna, butter fish, salmon, hirame, toro?  I ordered big time with two orders of Uni sushi, one order of Toro sashimi ($5.95) for four pieces. I think I was dreaming b/c this was cheaper than UNAGI!? Is that possible? For all other authentic Jap restaurant, Toro has always been the most expensive. Then again, I noticed the colour and texture is a bit different from the Toro I've experienced elsewhere before. The quality is alright, but not the best in my point of view.   Also got the Hamachi sashimi. Got the spider roll, negi toro, yam & avocado, and the best roll taste is spicy salmon.  Bento box is standard...Nothing stood out really. Sashimi Lunch is definitely a light meal if you are not that hungry, so good thing I ordered a bunch of stuff as well. But there is a good assortment of fish. Uni sushi, Toro Sashimi, Hamachi Sashimi- Hamachi was fine. Toro is a different experience but its alright. Uni is the usual creamy goodness.  Spider roll was cut into 8-10 pieces and it tasted fine. Negi Toro is alright taste. Yam & Avocado is great for vegetarian ppl. Spicy salmon most tastiest and flavourful of the rolls with a bit of a teaser with extra spicy salmon on top of the rolls.  Bill came out to $94 for lunch! Good place to dine, and price is definitely very fair in the Scarborough area. Would come back."}
{"text":"Sushi not fresh and colouring was definitely off. The miso soup was very blend. The congee was a nice touch but tasted mostly of msg. I saw a lot of good review so i was quite disappointed. Mayb the day i went was not a good day for them?"}
{"text":"I went to Niji years ago when it first opened.  I found the restaurant ok, but nothing to call home about.  I tried it again a couple months ago when I had a severe craving for sashimi but didn't want to go too far.  I ordered salmon and uni sashimi.  The salmon was okay, not super fresh but not awful either.  The uni was definitely not fresh and was honestly a bit gross.  I see a lot of positive reviews on here, I'm not sure if they are from East Asian reviewers, but I can tell you I have had much much better in the Scarborough/Markham area.  I think ordering cooked food would be okay, but I wouldn't go again for sashimi."}
{"text":"We have been regulars at Niji for 5 years. Strengths: high food quality, reasonable prices, service, ambiance,  convenient location and parking. Weaknesses: often have to line up. For dinner, we usually get Love Boat for 2 for $33 which includes entrees (miso soup, mixed tempura, salad, congee),  main course (assorted sashimi, some california rolls, braised beef and rice) and dessert (ice cream) for 2 people. The waiting staff is very efficient and professional. The owners are friendly.  As long as we crave sushi, we'll keep coming back for sure."}
{"text":"This is a great find. Located in a un-usual but easy to get to spot. There is free parking in the back. Price is quite affordable for Sushi. I went there with a big appetite and order the Bento Box # 4 (the one with eel and sushi). The food was quite filling and delicious. I also ordered some green tea and that was great as well. Next time I am getting some Saki."}
{"text":"I love ordering takeout from Niji. They are quick and always give fresh and rich flavored sashimi and sushi lunches.   I have a very sensitive stomach and Niji is one of the few establishments in Toronto that I can safely eat.   The location itself has great lighting and prompt service, much better than other experiences I have had in the local area.   I highly recommend this sushi restaurant for takeout or dine in."}
{"text":"Come on Yelp you're letting me down.  This place is terrible for sushi.  I knew something was a miss when there were 3 pieces of o toro for 6.95.  Still i couldnt resist...so wish i hadnt.      Somehow it was hard and chewy and dry and very wrong. The sushi set was also really bad.  The rice was way too mushy and just tasted off.  I honestly have been to ayce places that have had better fish than this place.  If you enjoy sushi and have eaten it in places other than mandarin please avoid as you will be disappointed. I gave it 2 star as the service was ok and the tempura was pretty good."}
{"text":"This is actually my favourite quick fix sushi spot in Scarborough. Located on the Southwest corner of Midland and Ellesmere (just a little south of the Midland RT station) Ni Ji Sushi has pretty high quality fresh fish that they use and it's great value as well. This whole sushi lunch that I bought was only $7.95 and it included the complimentary congee, salad, miso soup and some orange slices for dessert.  The other items that they serve outside of the sushi and the rolls aren't very good, but hey, for 8 bucks, the meal wasn't bad.  To read the rest of my blog review and to check out the photos from lunch, click here  http://bit.ly/1gJRZ8V  Happy Dining!"}
{"text":"Usually stop by on weekday for dinner, sometimes  there's a wait (that's how busy it is) but not too long. Consistently  good quality food at reasonable  price. Especially like the avocado  and tempura  yam rolls. The Spicy Salmon has a stronger kick to it, than what I am used to but still tastes good. Wish it was open on Sundays. ,"}
{"text":"Have been here approximately 8 times but didn't have a chance to write a review until now.    We got there for an early lunch and the staff is super friendly as always and it wasn't too busy as it was 11:45 on a Monday.  We ordered the sashimi and tempura lunch and a chicken teriyaki lunch.  The sashimi was really fresh and on the menu it said 9 pieces, but they gave me 13 pieces and 4 pieces of tempura (shrimp and yam).  The meal came with salad, miso soup, and a small bowl of really tasty congee.  The portions were really large and I couldn't quite finish the food.  Overall, the place is excellent and I can't find a better place for the value and quality.  Will definitely be back again soon and highly recommend."}
{"text":"I work close to this place so I always come here for lunch with my coworkers when we need our sushi fix.  Lunch specials are the way to go! Only available from 11:30 AM to 3 PM. All the specials come with green salad, miso soup and Korean congee. In addition to what you order on the lunch special menu, it also comes with japchae, pickled radish and this onion/carrot cold tempura thing, which is surprisingly good.  I always get the California+tempura lunch. Sometimes I change the California roll to the spicy salmon roll, for $1 extra. The tempura comes with 2 pieces of shrimp, 2 pieces sweet potato, 1 green bean and 1 onion ring. As well, you get orange for dessert, which is a nice change from the usual ice cream at other places. Food is always good (except one time I found a fruit fly in my salad... which they replaced with a new one right away), staff is friendly and service is always fast, always finish under one hour, which is my allotted lunch time.  Only down side is that the parking lot is very tiny and sometimes there's no parking at all."}
{"text":"Good sushi. They were closed for a while but they are open again. I ordered mostly sashimi. Good size pieces and really nice quality. I have been here a few times and will definitely go again and again.  Did order tempura and the pieces were VERY large. Makes dipping them in tempura sauce difficult. I see this in most Japanese restaurants. Maybe I'm doing it wrong?"}
{"text":"Ni Ji is a solid neighbourhood Japanese restaurant. When I lived in Scarborough this was my go-to; and now that I live in Toronto I will still make the trip out here when I have the time.   This restaurants food and price point is the standard in which I compare others to. Sure I've had better and worse sushi for more and less money respectively but for Ni Ji represents excellent value for higher than average food quality compared to its price.  Decor is simple and understated. I mean this in a positive way. The restaurant is bright, airy with a distinct Asian theme but not full of tacky decor. There are two screened booths, a bunch of tables and a back room area that can be used as semi private dining for larger groups. The dining area is sufficiently clean. The kitchen is open and exposed and also looks clean.  Service is excellent. The staff is friendly and prompt. Food comes quick.  Food quality and taste is delicious. Still the best spicy tuna and salmon rolls I've eaten. Most meals come with a little bit of grilled mackerel (fish) and edamame to share, a little salad and soup before the entre.   I wont get into details about each and every sushi/maki/handroll etc option they have as the variety is pretty standard between restaurants. Ni Ji isn't breaking any creative culinary ground in the Japanese food genre but what makes Ni Ji excellent is that they are taking simple Japanese-Canadian fare and offering better quality and taste than their competitors of the same price; and doing it consistently."}
{"text":"Solid! I love this place, because it actually seems as though they care about the quality of the food they put out.  Got the Salmon Teriyaki+ Maki combo, and my mind was blown. 5 Appetizers to start: Japanese Salad, Rice Porridge, Miso Soup, Seafood Salad, and Jap Chae.  My bento featured the aforementioned Salmon Teriyaki, Spicy Tuna Maki, Pickled Radishes, and Agedashi Tofu.   And a scoop of Green Tea Ice Cream to finish.  All for the amazing price of $12.95!!! I don't even know how they make money off of this. Such a steal, and everything is exquisitely delicious.  Love that I have a real deal Japanese place in my hood!"}
{"text":"Food: 4 Service: 3.5  Ambiance: 3 Overall: 3.5  Try their lunch sets...price is well worth it! My family was also pleasantly surprised when each of us was additionally served a portion of yummy congee, miso soup and salad each.  Recommendation: Tempura shrimp & vegetables (slightly on the oily side but large portions and still yummy!)"}
{"text":"The food is amazing--the fish is always fresh--and the service is great, given that it is always busy here.  A hidden gem in Scarborough for those that seek an alternative to the AYCE restaurants. I find Niji gives great value in their options."}
{"text":"Our fave local sushi spot. Reasonably priced, great lunch deals. And the service is great! It does get busy during the usual meal times, so be prepared to wait. You can always call ahead and do take out!  Yes, it may not have the best quality grade sushi, but for the friendly staff and the price, I'm not going to be picky about it."}
{"text":"The service was good but food was not what I expected as in the other people's review.  I ordered the Chirashi and was disappointed that the sashimi was cut so sloppy and thick.  Not gonna go back here again."}
{"text":"Utter disappointment with today's visit. We had a lunch special - #12A and #13. Gross chewy fish. Even the miso soup was flavorless. Blah experience! Sorry, not coming here again."}
{"text":"This is both of our favourite sushi joint. We have come here numerous times and every time have enjoyed the food, service and convenient location. We don't have to travel all the way downtown to have quality sushi, one of the few places in Scarborough! This restaurant the best spicy salmon maki I have ever had!! For 4.95 you get 6 amazing spicy salmon rolls with some shreds of salmon and spicy mayo on top. All combo's come with miso soup, congee, salad and 2 small appetizer (noodles and seaweed) to share, and of course ice-cream! The fish is very fresh and sushi/maki combo's are reasonably priced and you get your money's worth.  YOU MUST TRY THIS PLACE IF YOU HAVE NOT YET!"}
{"text":"Really good sushi restaurant!  We brought an infant to a packed restaurant for dinner and yet the service was extremely friendly and accommodating. The waitresses had fun with our infant. And I think they were actually Japanese waitresses which is a plus in a Japanese restaurant.   Food quantity and quality was terrific for the amount they charge.  Extremely affordable yet great quality food! Terrific restaurant!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch during a weekday and I was surprised at how busy this place already was! They have a menu of lunch specials with includes salad and miso soup and congee to start. I ended up ordering the salmon sashimi combo.   Omg. So good. The salmon was extremely fresh and the pieces were quite thick. They actually gave more pieces than indicated on the menu. The meal was quite filling.   Service was great as well. The servers kept on checking up on us and refilling our teas. I'd definitely like to come back here for a la carte Japanese in Scarborough."}
{"text":"My favs are spicy tuna and spicy salmon  love the spice . As well as the dragon for all the avocado . Comes Up to 25 with tax which is great value.  I mostly get take away but the interior is so nice and cozy. Miso soup and salad is good too"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place, it has great sushi and great service. Price is also very reasonable.  There are bento boxes, assortment of sushi to order separately as well as different combos like love boat and family boat."}
{"text":"I like the food , fresh, delicious. Usually I went with my boyfriend, and that's my boyfriend favorite place. And one more thing is closed my house and sometimes we can ordered take out easily."}
{"text":"Bop bop! Big ups to this scarcity joint. Don't sleep on this location. Ni Ji is by far one of the freshest and best sushi I have ever ate in the WORLD! The sashimi selection may not be as grand as some of the other places in tdot but the freshness and price or out of this world. Great for lunch!!!  Sapporo was only $5 for the large can!!!  Will be going here forever!"}
{"text":"this has got to be my favourite low key sushi place. EVER. The amount of times I've eaten here are countless and haven't broken my bank either. I love that they offer a 10% discount on any walk in pick up orders, so when I'm just running on change I can still enjoy a lunch special in my jeep! Which brings me back to pushing you to enjoy their lunch specials. Dirt cheap. The Kalbi?! ($8 incl. salad, miso, and glass noodles) YUM!! The sashimi is fresh and the maki is nice and tight. The spicy salmon ($5) is probably the best I have ever had - anywhere. It's reasonably priced during evenings too - but the lunch can't be beat. The congee they serve pre meal is pretty tasty too. I could go on and on, but I won't. My rating says it all. Also they have an amazing take out special 60 pieces ( 20 sashimi/20 maki/20 sushi) for $35 is unbeatable! I usually switch up the maki tho (obviously for that price they are Cali maki, but if I'm gonna buy a tray I'll be damned if paying $2 extra won't get me what I really want )  U won't regret this place!"}
{"text":"My husband and I visited this place because of Yelp, and because this is one of the closest sushi places to our house. I wasn't completely displeased, but it's not in the slightest my favourite sushi restaurant, nor do I think I will ever be back.  This place is very obviously owned by Koreans. They gave us the stereotypical Korean appetizers before our meal. They tasted great.  We went for an early dinner, and ended up getting one bento box and one small sushi/sashimi platter. One thing that did impress me was the fact that the california rolls are surprisingly good in comparison to other places I've been to. So if you stop by, don't be afraid to get a meal that comes with these: they're really not as boring as you might think (they come with fish eggs on top).  Our bento box came with traditional Korean-style beef, which is fine if you're okay with mixing fish and meat. I'd rather not, so it was a bit of a turn off, but it was a cheaper alternative to the all-sushi meals.  The maki rolls aren't the biggest. They're regular- to small-sized, so they're not altogether the most filling. The meat was good, although I didn't like that I had it with the sushi (as mentioned earlier). The tempura and tofu were also pretty good. The sushi and the sashimi were really thickly cut, however. I didn't notice this at first, because I'm usually okay with my sushi cut a little thicker. My husband pointed it out at the start of the meal and I thought nothing of it. But by the end of the meal, even I started feeling a little sick at how thick the sashimi cuts were.  All in all, decent portions at reasonable prices for a sushi place, but there's nothing spectacular at all about it. It's just your average run of the mill sushi restaurant with pretty good sushi. So I probably won't ever come back here.  Also, as an end note, the place was pretty much empty when we went. The service was good and pretty quick due to this, but the restaurant owner kept staring at us, which I found quite a bit unsettling. So as I said before, probably not coming back to this place. I'd rather drive a bit out of my way to go to a better sushi restaurant than stick to this one."}
{"text":"Ni Ji is a solid sushi spot for a quick lunch or afternoon chat with a friend. The quality of the fish definitely tastes quite fresh and tasty. The staff are always friendly and willing to accomodate if you want to adjust your meal without an extra charge. For the price you pay for the lunch specials, it's a total bargain and value for your dollar. For easy, fresh sushi à la carte with a smile, Niji is the way to go in the Scarborough area."}
{"text":"Ni Ji Sushi is a small family owned Japanese restaurant. The first time I came for lunch, I was not impressed by the bento box. I gave it another chance for dinner since my friends raved about this place. The Osaka Sushi combo and Spider Roll did not disappoint. I have gone back since, usually also for these items. The fish is always fresh and tasty. The price is reasonable, but somewhat more expensive than a comparable place I like in Markham. However, its close to my house and I like supporting local businesses."}
{"text":"Great food choices and a lot of complimentary soups as well as salad. I thought the prices were reasonable and the food was fantastic. Loved the sushi pizza."}
{"text":"Came here to try this place with a friend as she recommended this place since she heard it was good. My friend ordered the seaweed salad, and the spicy crab roll. 4 stars for this restaurant because the sashimi was fresh and the quality was great. My friend was a bit more particular with her orders, and the restaurant was not accommodating to her order, and the service was only mediocre."}
{"text":"Walked into this sushi place in Scarborough because our usual Japanese restaurant was closed.  A little bit on the pricey side but they do compensate with the fresh, big, thick sashimi slices that were included in the Love boat for two.  It is definitely worth the price. This place is good for big appetites"}
{"text":"Best sushi restaurant in the Scarborough area. Staff and service is fast and friendly. Prices are great and they offer all the sushi types you would need. Recently tried the udon seafood soup and was a great choice."}
{"text":"The resturant is one of the top sushi joints in Scarborough if not the best.    My friend and I are constantly going here for dinner when we crave sushi and japanese/korean food.  The staff is so friendly, food is delicioous and the prices are reasonable.    Though it's not the cheapest place for bento boxes they have a great selection of them and are priced between $13 and $23.  Sushi combos are also great if you're looking for a little of everything.  I personally like the chirashi dinner as it comes with a mountain of sashimi (it is odds and ends pieces though) on a bed of perfectly seasoned sushi rice all for $14.  My friend tipically gets the bulgogi bento $13, comes with a generous portion of meat, california roll, salmon roll, glass noodles, rice, and pickled radish.  All set dinners come with miso soup, salad, a small portion of congee (which is a nice touch) and ice cream for dessert.  The restaurant is typically packed during dinner and on weekends waits are expected.  If you want to avoid waiting come before 7pm or after 9pm.  It's also a cozy restaurant so you will most likely be seated closely to other people but it hasn't bothered me.  Ideally they should really consider expanding or moving locations to accomadate the growing number of patrons.  Overall it is a must try if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"Nice service with tasty sushi The place is small and cozy, perfect to grab lunch with a co-worker or a friend."}
{"text":"So I went to Niji a little while ago for a lunch, and to make it brief, I was astounded by the amount of food I got. I was sitting at a standard two person table, and my meal alone filled up the entire table!! I swear I'm not a fatty, they just give a lot of food.  Don't expect extraordinary sushi or anything, but they have decent rolls and large bentos that will fill you up for affordable prices.  Be warned! As of when I went a couple weeks ago, there was no air conditioning. And be prepared to fight off a particularly annoying fly (just one!) that I had to deal with my entire meal.   Besides that though, everything is fairly fresh and it's probably one of the better, affordable sushi places in Scarborough.  For more information and more pictures, you can go to my food blog, located conveniently in my profile. :)"}
{"text":"My friends and I practically live here. It's our go-to sushi place in Scarborough. Great sushi, no matter what you order. My favourite is definitely their spicy kani. Their sashimi is also pretty good (not too thick of a cut, but not thin either). It's pretty much always packed every time we walk in, so we tend to just get take out."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place. Best spicy salmon rolls, fried calamari, and fresh crispy salad- every single time. It does get busy and I wish they had more of a dessert menu but their green tea ice cream is complimentary anyway! A must try if you haven't yet."}
{"text":"Nice and warm place. The space is tight but manageable.   The quality of the food is excellent and the pricing is reasonable. The meal was not rushed and the free ice cream at the end of our meal made us feel welcomed."}
{"text":"Small restaurant but friendly servers. I told the servers I was in a rush to get out in 25 mins and they made sure I had my drinks app and food at a speedy pace.  The black dragon roll was delicious. The unagi was fresh and flavourful. Rice was fluffy and sticky. I devoured it. I feel that for a 14 dollar roll that when asked for spicy mayo that mayo should be free not at a charge of 50 cents..  Also had the bento bulgogi box, that was also yummy. Loved the jap chae that came wit it. Adored the green tea ice cream as a finishing touch for a fine meal.  No wonder this place was jam packed!"}
{"text":"Um Yum: This is actually the third time I have been here. The sashimi is fresh and affordable (12 pcs for just under $13 - lunch special). I also ordered a gyoza (pot sticker) appetizer, but it wasn't the best I have had :| The wait staff are friendly and attentive as well.   I will be going back!"}
{"text":"Its great to have a place in Scarborough that is clean with decent Sushi. I came here recently craving some Sushi and found this place on Yelp. I have to say there is nothing really bad to say about this place. The fish was good, and the portions were on par with most Japanese restaurants. Their prices were competitive and the service was great. (only 2 other tables at the time). There is nothing outstanding about this place but that isn't always a bad thing. I can't think of any better Japanese restaurants in the immediate area so I will definitely make this place my east end Scarborough Sushi spot."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times. I wouldn't say they have the best sushi but they are still ranked one of the top few places in my opinion (GTA area). Their bento boxes are really filling. Sashimi is not very fresh but still fresh. The salmon sashimi i had this time was really rich and almost melted in my mouth, but the tuna i had was a little bit mushy. Price wise I would say maybe a bit more than average (for dinner). They do have some good lunch specials so I would give that a try.   This place is worth a try but definitely not one of my regular places. I only go here when I am around the area and craving Japanese food."}
{"text":"Service, food portions and wait times are great factors when coming here.   So far for the past few visits I haven't waited longer than a minute to be seated; the service is always attentive and fast; and the food - filling with decent price ranges.   I would recommend and come here again."}
{"text":"Checked out Ni Ji sushi recently with a friend around noon on a weekday. The restaurant was packed, we waited less than 10 minutes for a table. Once seated service was good and our food came out quickly.  The food was delicious and fresh. Between us we had the vegetarian bento box, a dragon roll, and spring rolls. Everything was great. I loved the inari sushi! It's a little out of the ways for me but I hope to find a reason to be in this neighbourhood again soon!"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times for work lunches and have never left hungry. You get quite a bit of food with the lunch specials. I usually switch up the california roll with the combo for spicy salmon for a dollar more. They even put bits of extra salmon on top of the rolls for you. I've gotten a few of the different lunch specials and they were all great. Not much else to say. Great lunch option, great prices, good portion sizes. :)"}
{"text":"So happy this place has finally reopened. It's my go-to sushi place in Scartown. Anything off this menu is incredibly good - some of my favs are the sashimi, the salmon bento box, dynamite and dragon rolls. They also do takeout so you can call ahead and order. They've been quite busy the past few weeks because people have been flooding in after the restaurant's hiatus. Trust me the wait is worth it. They don't do AYCE but if you're looking for a nice sushi restaurant with quality food this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Food is decent. Got the bulgogi bento box combo, which comes with miso soup, salad and porridge. The bulgogi was quite tasty. The sushi in the bento tasted average, the salmon could have been more fresh. However, for the price this is pretty worth it and it looked like a fairly clean restaurant.   Service was also prompt. Would recommend if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times and I really like their bento boxes. Portion is fair and reasonably priced. Sushi and sashimi are really fresh."}
{"text":"We visited on the Valentine's Day. It was really busy and they didn't take any reservation! We got the Loves Boat for 2 people. The price is cheap and we got lots of foods. It's good enough for 2 people. I don't really like the beef bulgogi because it's too sweet!"}
{"text":"Ordered the love boat for two and was completely satisfied with the meal! The sashimi cuts tasted fresh and the amount of food it came with for the price is a good deal; fills you right up. Definitely one of the better sushi restaurants in Scarborough if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I am been waiting for this restaurant to reopen since they have had the fire back in the spring. Still quite busy even on a late Thursday evening when I went there for dinner with a friend after 9:30pm.  The lighting and decor of the place is brighter and more open than before. I got the osaka sushi special and my friend got the sashimi special. We were impressed with the quantity of food, presentation, service and quality. We liked the salad, soup, Korean congee they give you to start. They even included a scoop of green tea ice cream at the end of the meal and we were not expecting that. Well worth it!"}
{"text":"This place is great for value for money. The sushi and bento boxes and combos are all worth it and this place has pretty high traffic during dinner hours.  The staff are all great and they turn the tables over pretty quickly so dont stress if you ever have to wait.  Their $40 love boat combo has everyones favorite \"go to\" selections such as rolls, tempura, salad, soup, bulgogi and probably some other things I may be missing.  Their salmon bento box is delicious and super filling as well.  Come here if you are looking for good value sushi!"}
{"text":"3.5/5   I came here with a friend during lunch time.   We ordered the sashimi lunch bento. Comes with a side of congee - interesting but very tasty. Thick slices of fresh sashimi which I was quite impressed with. There was some tempura fried onion or yam stuff in it... which was cold and soggy - that part of the bento turned me off and was untouched throughout the meal. Otherwise the portion for it was good.   My friend loves the spicy tuna and spicy salmon maki rolls here because it's spicier than other places. I agree it's spicier than what I am use to. The rolls are quite small and we ordered 2 of the spicy tuna and 2 of the salmon.  We also ordered the spicy tuna dragon roll which is a better version of the spicy tuna maki due to the creamy avocado on top!  I would say the value is good during lunch and for the portion size it came in. OK service."}
{"text":"I go to Ni-Ji quite often because of the fresh and delicious sushi. The customer service is also amazing. It is not too cheap and not too pricey, perfect for the quality.   Definitely is worth coming, very convenient and located walking distance from Midland RT station. Tends to get busy weekend nights so plan your time!!"}
{"text":"You know a restaurant is good when the place is PACKED. we went during lunch time and there was no room to sit so had to order out. Sushi was very fresh, definitely recommend for lunch!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday night because Roll N Bowl was closed. They were very busy. Our waitress was nice but it was so busy she didn't really have time to tend to us.  I found the rolls to be fairly small and not as filling as I hoped. The taste was also only OK, not bad but also not particularly good.  They gave us complimentary soup, salad and dessert which was nice, but not enough to make up for our disappointing meals."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. We usually go out to AYCE sushi to get the most bang for our buck, but for a Saturday night, AYCE gets very pricey. We went to Ni Ji as we had not gone here for years but it still does not disappoint!   Small issue would be having to find parking, but we got lucky and found one empty spot. However as we arrived, we were seated immediately.   We all got variations of Bento Boxes (Chicken Teriyaki, Beef Bulgogi, and Salmon Teriyaki.) We received salad and congee as appetizers and when the bento boxes arrived the portions were huge. Very glad we came here as opposed to eating a fast-food bento box from STC's food court. To finish off the meal, they served us green tea ice cream.   It was great. Definitely would come back in the near future when having a sushi craving."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I finally tried this place out after knowing it was there for so long. We had to park at the plaza across the street because parking was tight. It definitely gets very busy around dinner time on a Saturday, but the wait wasn't so bad. Food came out reasonably fast with nice presentation. We were satisfied after our meal and they gave us a scoop of green tea ice cream afterwards. Overall not a bad place to go to."}
{"text":"This place is one of the only options for lunch near work. I have never actually had a meal inside, only ordered for pick up. I've tried several different rolls, and they are generally good, but I haven't had anything so amazing that I would go there for anything other than lunch. It seems like a nice place, and it's always busy. Maybe I'll have a sit down meal soon and give an updated review. Until then, this is a nice little place in Scarborough, but nothing outstanding about it."}
{"text":"Two words: spicy Kani (maki). Literally order it everytime I come here and never disappoints.   The restaurant is very tiny, so I would skip this place during rush hour. However they do takeout and are pretty quick about it."}
{"text":"3.5 stars really. This place is an a la carte sushi restaurant located right at Midland and Ellesmere. Came here during lunch on Friday and we had to wait around 15mins to get a seat for 5 people. I ordered the lunch special bento which was chicken teriyaki, tempura and california rolls (10.95). The chicken teriyaki was better than last time, but still kind of dry. The tempura and california rolls tasted good.   All the lunch specials come with soup, salad and congee, There was actually a hair in one of our salads which was kind of gross but they gladly replaced it for us.   Overall, it's a good place to satisfy your sushi craving but the service is adequate  and a little slow."}
{"text":"Wow, another great find in Scarborough near our area. This restaurant is just a few minutes from STC on Ellesmere. We came here because our fave sushi resto Ichiban was closed. However, it turned out to be a great experience.   Service was super friendly from the moment we walked in the door. We were greeted and sat down right away. The restaurant was also busy for a rainy Tuesday evening so that was a good sign.   We ordered the Love Boat combo for 2 for $40! The boat itself came with an assortment of sashimi, sushi, salmon maki, California roll. The combo also included tempura, soup, salad, congee AND a small dish of bulgogi! Wow talk about value for your money! Everything was delicious and came out quick. The only thing that I would comment on is the poor cut of the sashimi. The pieces were cut too thick.  But overall, definitely a great place if you are looking for decent quality sushi for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch because we were in the area.  Saw good reviews but unfortunately the place isn't very good.  The only good thing is the relatively good service and the cheap prices.   We ordered the Sashimi & Tempura lunch and the Combination Lunch, consisting of chicken teriyaki, California roll & tempura.  The sashimi was ok, nothing great but edible. For the price of $13.95, you can't really complain.  The chicken teriyaki was pretty bland and wasn't grilled, just looked boiled.  The California rolls were ok, like supermarket quality.  The worst part was the tempura.  The batter was hard and not at all crispy.  It wasn't enjoyable at all.   The place was packed and people were waiting for tables, at various times.  Also, lots of people were ordering takeout.  The lunches came with salad, miso and congee.  I doubt I'd ever return here again.  I've had much better food from an AYCE sushi place.  Only good factor is the cheap price.  The parking lot is very small and tight too, I'm glad that I wasn't driving today!"}
{"text":"Still awesome.   Got takeout for the first time. A sushi platter for $60.   As always it was amazing. Beautiful cuts of fish. There were salmon and California rolls. Sashimi red tuna, white tuna, salmon, surf clam, Mackrell and everything we could want.   The picture is from after we started... couldn't wait for a photo it looked so delicious.   100% would be back for takeout."}
{"text":"Classic sushi restaurant in Scarborough. The go-to place if you're not craving all you can eat.   They also do take out if you want to have a night in with your favourite Japanese dishes!"}
{"text":"Decided to give Niji a try again - on a Saturday evening around 7pm. They were pretty packed, and I had a bitter taste in my mouth from my past experience. I was surprised! They were fast, customer service was definitely improved- they even did a food satisfaction check. I ordered beef Terriyaki, and now it's served on a plate vs a stone sizzling plate which I like so the meat doesn't over cook. This bimbimbap wasn't great, but I ordered it not expecting much from it since I was at a sushi place. The Green Dragon Roll was just as good as I remembered! And the shrimp tempura was fresh out of the deep fryer! The waitress topped up my tea, and brought the complimentary miso soup, salad, small porridge, and green tea ice cream- without having to be asked! I was happy that they didn't try to tell me it was $1. Prices have slightly gone up, but that's a given from 5+ years ago. I will definitely be coming back more often."}
{"text":"We went to eat here a few years back and ordered the love boat. Don't remember much from that experience but we returned last week and ordered the love boat again. We requested to have all our sashimi be salmon sashimi, the request was fulfilled without problem.   We were given tea once we sat down. The appetizers promptly came after we ordered. (I really like the korean noodles.) The love boat includes korean appetizers, edamame (not enough of it though), salad, miso soup, tempura, sushi, maki rolls, sashimi, bulgogi, and ice cream ('though I might have missed an item). I really think this boat is more meant to feed 3 people rather than 2, we felt really bloated afterwards.  The sashimi doesn't melt in your mouth, but it has the salmon flavour at least. Other than that, everything was made properly and tasted good. They add wasabi in the sushi, so be careful if you do not eat wasabi.   The place is decently decorated, but sadly, it is a relatively small restaurant and they only have 2 booth seats which are always taken by other customers. Either way, this is one of the few japanese restaurants we would return to."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place is so popular but their selections are okay. I just don't understand the rave about this place, but maybe it's the only sushi joint in Scarborough... And this is what Scarborough residence flock to.   The sushi is okay not the greatest. And it's quite expensive for basic rolls. I would rather go somewhere else.   Parking sucks Small portions Expensive for small portions Always busy No  substitutions Not worth the wait"}
{"text":"\"A neat little neighborhood restaurant with affordable prices and quick service. We truly enjoyed how much light got into the restaurant through the large windows and the easy-going interior organization.\" \"The fish as well as all the condiments and rice were fresh and flavorful.\"  This is just a bite of our short&sweet review.."}
{"text":"3 words: Good. Quality. Sushi.  From the amount of business they get and how booming the restaurant always is, you can already tell it's a good sushi place.  I love my sashimi, and let me tell you this place has great fresh fish. It is a little pricey since it's a la cart, but there are specials (and lunch) where you can really get a bang for your buck. The service is generally very consistent and good, and your meal comes with miso soup, congee, and ice cream.   When you're not feeling ayce, this place is a great alternative in Scarborough."}
{"text":"I don't care if people flame but I personally don't know what the hype is surrounding this place. Friday night @ 6:30pm, no resos, and a friend and I were seated immediately. The restaurant wasn't packed but we were rushed to order food within 5 minutes of sitting down. Politely told waitress (who was friendly BTW) that I was not ready and she gave us more time. ONLY to return within 3 minutes to ask again. At this point, I'm a bit annoyed and it showed.   She stands there and begins to give me recommendations. Her reco. was actually $3 more than getting a sushi dinner. LOL. I ended up getting the Sapporo Sushi for $14.95 with 7pcs of assorted nigiri, 6 pcs maki and 1 giant hand roll. Portions were large for the price and sushi tasted 'good'. Friend ordered the bento and seemed satisfied with the food.   I don't know what is more annoying. 1. When we finished our food and I had 3 pieces of nigiri and the hand roll leftover and asked to have it packed, she was hesitant to give me a box. OR 2. when they gave us ice cream and we hadn't even asked for the bill and they brought the machine over at the same time. I literally felt like I had a minute to eat the ice cream. Never felt so rushed at a sushi resto before. Oh, the place wasn't even packed and 1 couple was waiting for seats. Why the rush?    This place is average in my books. Average sushi, average prices."}
{"text":"They re-opened about a month ago with new renovations made to their dining area. I've come here multiple times before with my family and yet again, their service was spectacular. The sushi is good. We had ordered the love boat and it's definitely a great portion for two. It came with two salads and two soups for appetizer, the sushi boat, bulgogi and green tea ice cream to finish it all up. Their menu is priced reasonably."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on Saturday. Got the Sapporo combo and the special bento combo. The bento combo had over 20 pieces of great quality sashimi and sushi. We substituted the makis for spicy scallop and spicy salmon. Those were amazing and the spicy salmon is a must try! Meals also came with a delicious congee, salad and miso. Not only that, but they gave us green tea ice cream at the end too!! Service was great; very friendly and attentive staff. Way better value than AYCE. Would give them 10 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Not a bad place. I came here once and the sushi was not that good. It's a hit of miss with this place. Not that many sushi places to choose from in the area. The staff is okay."}
{"text":"I hate to leave a negative review for Ni Ji Sushi, but it seems it became a very different restaurant when they re-opened after the fire incident. This used to be my go-to sushi joint; the quality of the dishes and individual sushi offerings was impeccable and one of the best in Scarborough, with large portions and hearty nigiri pieces. Unfortunately, after visiting again for the first time after they re-opened, they have significantly jacked up prices and decreased the portion sizes. My particular order was individual sushi pieces from the A La Carte menu, and they were approximately 60% of the size they used to be. To add insult, the prices were increased by 40-70% for each selection (which I only discovered after making my payment at the cash register, since I ordered pick-up through an \"old\" online version of the menu). The result was that I paid ~$18 for four bites worth of food. I'm disappointed at how much Ni Ji has changed for the worse, and unfortunately I can no longer recommend it in regards to value for your money. There are other sushi restaurants out there that offer the same/similar quality and larger portions for cheaper prices.   Rated two stars because the staff is still courteous and friendly."}
{"text":"Ni Ji Sushi is a hidden gem.  It's hidden in a random plaza near to STC and I would've never known about it if it weren't for Yelp.  It's definitely one of my favourite sushi places in the GTA now.  I did my due diligence the night before and knew to order the Love Boat ($39.99).  This combo was amazing.  Not only do you get miso soup + salad, but you also get a bowl of congee.  Next, the glorious Love Boat with nicely arranged sushi, sashimi, and rolls docked on to our table.  The fish was super fresh and thickly sliced.  It was great.  And then BAM, in the middle of our Love Boat course, they delivered us a bowl of bugolgi and rice.  AND THEN you also get a bowl of green tea ice cream.  The additions of congee, bulgogi, ice cream were nice and put the value overtop.  Ni Ji Sushi is great.  Great sushi and great value."}
{"text":"Now if we're talking Sushi....like actual nigiri sushi not maki (rolls), then this place is a winner! This was some of the freshest sushi I've eaten in a while. As a matter of fact, I didn't realize that I hadn't been eating fresh sushi until eating here. The ratio of Fish to rice is 3 to 1....as in you are eating a big slab of fish with a little bit of rice, as opposed to some places where it feels like you are eating a ball of rice with a thin slice of fish.  They also have Toro (tuna belly) for pretty cheap compared to other places I've seen it. I think it was $4.95  The green tea ice cream was gross! But I think that's just me, I like my vanilla ice cream and/or mango ice cream...Never been a fan of Red Bean and Green Tea."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to try this popular sushi place today and I'm so glad I did!  Service is fast, friendly, and the best part is the food quality, really good sushi and food options!  Dinner choices come with miso soup and salad, a small congee, and a small ice cream scoop after the meal for free which is a nice touch!  I got the fried rice with chicken ($10.95) and my fiance got the Sashimi dinner ($16.95).  Fried rice with chicken - very tasty and a good serving size. I am impressed by how tasty and non-greasy this dish is and I like the ratio of the rice with the chicken, there is a great amount of chicken, which is really good.  Sashimi dinner was great too, flavorful and nice big sushi sizes.  Over-all I would recommend going to this place, as they serve good sushi. Would definitely come back, possibly to try their lunch specials.  Review 83 of 100"}
{"text":"Great deal when getting the sushi/maki platter. Good quality/quantity ratio for the price at $40. When dining in, food was just as good and portion size is better than average. Overall, the price and service makes this place a decent japanese/korean spot in Scarborough."}
{"text":"This is one of the best sushi bar I ate in Toronto. Salmon teriyaki is my favourite food."}
{"text":"Came here for sat lunch at 12pm. I'm so impressed with the presentation; everything is neatly presented and looks very appetizing. But it seems like lunch specials are only for weekdays!  We had a corner table where the bench was oddly cut in half because there was a post in the corner. Good thing I'm small because it only had half the dept of sitting space.  All the waitresses here are on point-- very kind and attentive (5/5). Our waitress was so kind to give me miso soup when I didn't order it. I like how the soup is not salty.  Food is great (4/5). The sushi is good, though the tempura is crispy, I felt like it could be crispier with more batter. At least it wasn't dripping in oil."}
{"text":"There isn't a lot of food choices near my work, so due to restriction this is as good as it gets within walking distance. They have a good selection of lunch specials available, however after ordering their sushi rolls I was disappointed in their tiny size. Thought there would be a little more filling. Overall, their rolls are lacklustre but their lunch specials are worth getting. This is based on pickup orders, I have yet to dine-in. But during lunch it is packed so I suggest going early or making a reservation if possible for lunch/during busy times."}
{"text":"Visited again after renovation and re-opening.  Still as busy as ever on weekends.  We come here when we do not feel like ayce.  Dining room is a lot brighter and more spacious.  Lots of side dishes with entree.  Soup, salad, congee and green tea ice cream.  Not a lot of variety in fish so food comes out superfast.  Service is efficient.  Fish is fresh.  Sushi boat dinner for 2 is good value.  Also comes with beef bulgogi and rice.  I find it too sweet.  But party of 6 can eat for less than $120.  Good place for sushi if u want a quick and reasonably priced dinner and do not want to stuff yourself at ayce."}
{"text":"The best, freshest, sushi ever. I come back again and again, I've been coming here for several years, the owners practically have seen me grow up! I always get the osaka sushi! A long time ago they used to have tofu with this sweet sauce, fish, spicy wakame salad along side with the miso soup, congee and salad! Their salad is by far the most addicting dressing I've ever had! Niji is truly the best quality sushi in all of Scarborough."}
{"text":"Just had dinner with my Mom and Sis ... the good part first ... the food was very reasonable in terms of price and quantity (WOW so much food) ... However in terms of service it was not the best but they got the food to the table at least ... I had the sushi platter and found the quality of the fish not the best  ... However my sister and moms dishes of shrimp tempura and the vegetable bento box they thought was great and worth the money ... the cherry on the top i have to say to this meal was a FREE scoop of green tea ice-cream (Yummy) which i thought was a nice touch ... However all-in-all ... I've been to better sushi places in terms of quality and service ... so i give it a 3.5 star rating ;)"}
{"text":"I have been going here for 13 years now, ever since they first opened.  The sushi is wonderful and fresh.  They don't cheap out on the fish, and load the sushi with a ton of rice.  Everything is perfectly proportioned and very well seasoned.  I have eaten sushi all over the city, and this is by far the best!"}
{"text":"This place was hella crowded on Friday daytime, which means it must be good! And it was. Me and a friend split 3 rolls and each roll was really good. Service was decently paced. Price was....reasonable. Technically you could get AYCE for the bill we each paid. But we were full and the sushi was good.   My only problem was that they didn't have shrimp tempura appetizer (only mixed tempura which included shrimp and vegetables). We asked for shrimp tempura to see if they had something off-menu and they gave us and charged us for the mixed tempura appetizer, but without the vegetables. So that was a \"learning experience\".   Bottom line - if you're in the area, this place is pretty good for sushi a la carte."}
{"text":"I have been here twice. Just once before the infamous fire and today. I am so glad Niji opened again because this is good spot to get both Korean and Japanese food.  So Niji was closed for quite a while due to a fire incident and it's still as good as it was before it (not like that should change anything right?). It looks the same as it was before if I remember correctly, minus the shiny new walls.  Came here for lunch this time and there was a plethora of lunch specials (decent value) but nothing really caught my eye (or stomach?) as I'm not that big of a bento fan. We opted for some other things and I'm so glad we did that.  Dolsot bibimbap - really enjoyed this staple. There wasn't too much rice, the namul was crunchy and delicious.  However the rice wasn't crusting on the bottom of the bowl (even after letting it sit), which meant the bowl wasn't hot enough. No sizzle.   Sashimi donburi - or hoedeopbap. Good amount of sashimi and the veggies were nice and crisp here too which is a must. Their chojang/sauce was also really good. It's more runny here - you can taste the sweetness and vinegar. That's how it's supposed to be. I like the sauce more sweet and vinegar in taste!  Spicy salmon dragon and crispy roll - really fresh and delicate but it was on the smaller side. Great spicy roll, with no breadcrumbs and purely salmon and spicy mayo (that's how I like it!). Probably should have called it green dragon spicy salmon as there was a healthy amount of avocado on top. Crispy roll wasn't anything special though, and probably could have been more crisp.   Lunch combination bento - the parents got this. I didn't think it was anything special either. Tempura was okay but it just wasn't consistent. The shrimp was great, but for some reason the onion one was dense and lacked any sort of crunch.   Or right, I can't forget their juk (congee) it is fantastic.  Overall, I think if you stick to the special rolls and Korean items (they are Korean owned afterall),  you'll have a pleasant experience here at Niji."}
{"text":"I love this sushi place. I wanted to try something new with a friend and discovered this place through Yelp. My friend and I got a bento box and it was very good. It tasted good and was pricey reasonably. We went on a weekday, however at their lunch period it was super busy. Almost the entire restaurant was packed. I would highly recommend this sushi place if your in the area."}
{"text":"Came here during lunch due to the rave reviews and high rating on yelp. Maybe I just had bad luck here, but my experience left a really bad taste in my mouth. The salmon was the only thing that was worth eating (good amount of fat), though slightly fishy.  Tempura was hard and ice cold.  Ordered fatty tuna and the whole piece was sinew. First time I've ever spat out sushi.   Uni was not completely fresh but it was edible. $7 for 2 pieces wasn't worth it.  $20/person total for the entire meal. Wasn't nearly full.   I probably won't ever come back. I recommend Gal's Sushi & Aka-oni (GTA area) and even Mac's sushi over this."}
{"text":"Glad that this Scarborough GEM is reopened after the 2015 fire. Sushi is fresh and the cooked food is great. Lunch specials are a great value. Good portions at decent prices!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. A medium size shop. Not too busy during peak times. Staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Very good sushi place! Super close to where I live so it's extremely convenient. The place is small so you should go there before 6:30 or you'll end up waiting a while for a table. I usually order take out and it's ready so fast even though it's extremely busy every time I order."}
{"text":"Went to Niji's today (Tuesday for lunch) for the first time since before it closed down. The interior has changed a lot... they used to have \"semi-private\" booths to the right when you first enter and the actual sushi chefs were also by the front, on the left. The sushi chefs have shifted down now and there are no more booths to sit in. It seems a lot more open.   My husband and I each ordered the lunch bento which included 6 California rolls, assorted tempura, glass noodles, chicken terriyaki and rice. We also got miso soup, salad and a small bowel of congee to start. Total cost was $11.95 each plus $1.00 charge since my husband wanted spicy salmon sushi instead of California rolls. The food was okay. Nothing spectacular... the tempura batter was actually hard though. We had to soak the tempura in the sauce for a while before eating. For dessert, we had half an orange to share. Not a lot, but it was sweet.  Anyways, its an okay eat if you're around the area and don't want to spend too much. Or maybe you just aren't hungry enough for AYCE. Otherwise, I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here. Our waitress was very nice and kept checking on us but I'm not sure if that was just because they weren't busy."}
{"text":"I ordered the chirashi sushi which came with Miso soup, salad and green tea ice cream. The sashimi they gave were fresh and the pieces were pretty big. You may be paying a couple dollars more here but the quality and service makes up for it. I ordered the Salmon bento for my friend but the server misheard me and thought I said \"seven bento\" so she gave us a tempura bento instead. Without a fuss she took it right back and very quickly gave us what we wanted. I've been to too many places that try to make you keep it or tell you that it's your fault before fixing their mistake. The way they handled the situation gave them the extra half point. I would go back."}
{"text":"Excellent food  great flavor and layers  Fast and easy  I highly recommend this place Thanks"}
{"text":"Delicious and well priced. Ordered a Bento and was surprised by the portion. The places gets busy but not bad, absolutely recommend it. Great place to eat if you are in Scarborough. There isn't too many good restaurant around."}
{"text":"had bento combo #4 w/ eel, salmon, and cali rolls  it was pretty standard so it didn't match the higher price end of $18.95+ tax and the salmon sashimi, although thick, wasn't cut properly so it was slightly tough to chew on"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was a kid. In the past, I've come to Ni Ji to celebrate my birthday, The birthdays of friends and family and even impulsively, on normal days when I'd crave their Bento Box. Upon my most recent visit however, I was disappointed to find that something had changed. Without going into great detail, my first complaint had to do with small bits of hair in a couple of my dishes. Also the beef in the Bento box that I ordered was unusually bland and dry. It had the taste and texture  of a microwaved dish. My other complaint involved our server/possibly manager making a big deal out of giving us the necessary sized boxes to take home our leftovers. She offered us 2 tiny styrofoam containers for a portion that clearly needed at least 5-6. Mind you, we are not the type of group to take issue with such a petty mistake however upon her return when we politely showed her we needed at least three more containers she hesitated as if she was disappointed at the inconvenience of her having to return with more. She returned with just 1 box! Still showing patience we politely informed her that we would need maybe 2-3 more because the container was so tiny that we couldn't even close the ones we tried to fill. Clearly she had been holding on to a bit of resentment as our absolutely reasonable request yielded a snarky response of \"umm, are you sure you need more?\" This was followed by her physically reaching over to examine each of the boxes we filled completely  as if to make sure we weren't, for some odd reason, trying to stiff her for styrofoam boxes(??) She didn't say anything, went back and returned yet again with one tiny box, with a disapproving look. At that point she managed to annoy the whole group and we were eager to leave. Ni Ji has always been a model of great service and food but I was really disappointed to find that something has changed. I feel compelled to offer one star however I cannot bring myself to forget about all the great memories I've had here. I hope that this was a rare night for them. If our server is going through something difficult outside of work that is affecting her mood, I sincerely apologize for seeming inconsiderate. However I must evaluate the business as it is and perhaps this will serve to help them reassess and regroup so they can return to form."}
{"text":"This place is good. The beef bulogi (sorry for the spelling) is my favorite. Not as great as certain places downtown but for a Scarborough sushi joint, pretty good. The bento boxes are good too and I don't mind the maki rolls. Overall a good place to grab a meal."}
{"text":"Ni Ji Sushi is definitely a gem in the Scarborough area. It has been one of my favourite sushi restaurants in the area for years. Parking in the small lot can be quite horrendous during peak hours.   They offer lunch specials from 11:30 - 3:00, starting from $6.95. Each meal comes with some small Korean appetizers, including seaweed, edamame beans, congee, miso soup, and a salad. I usually order the combination special ($11.95), which includes tempura shrimp/veggies, chicken teriyaki, and 6 pieces of California rolls. You won't walk away feeling hungry.  Service is quick and efficient in delivering your food. I never have to wait long before food starts filling up the table.   Will definitely be back!  Note: This place gets really packed during the lunch and dinner peak hours."}
{"text":"Came here based on the reviews and it was super packed on a Saturday evening (6pm). The interior of the restaurant was very clean and pretty and the waitresses wore traditional Japanese clothing styles. We only waited about 10 minutes before we were seated. I thought the prices would be a little bit cheaper but they seemed pretty average.  I ordered the unagi don and the dish came with Miso soup, congee (whaaat?!) and salad as appetizers. The congee was very very good! The food came out pretty quick but sad to say I was a little disappointed with my dish. The teriyaki taste was very light and the eel was a little too fishy. I would prefer a more flavorful sauce and enough to spread around the rice. I had some salmon sashimi from my friends and it was fresh and delicious! We were all full and satisfied with our meal. In the end, we were pleasantly surprised with the serving of matcha icecream.  Definitely go for sashmi / sushi here rather than the other dishes!"}
{"text":"5/5  I come here often.. the fish is always fresh, and the service is great. I would say it's quite pricey, especially because its a la carte (you could pay a few dollars more somewhere else for AYCE), but I think it's well worth it. The portion sizes are just enough (vs. stuffing your face at an all you can eat, and feeling guilty/sick afterwards). I've only been for dinner but would like to see if they have a lunch menu with specials."}
{"text":"Niji is the bee's KNEE, GEE!   This place is great for big portions of fresh sushi at a reasonable price.  Bento box #6 - $20 and came with a slew of food. Started off with a salad, congee, miso soup. The box came with tempura, sushi, rolls, glass noodles and finished with a scoop with a green tea ice cream. Salmon sashimi was bomb. Very fresh, not chewy and cut thick.   Black dragon roll -  Wasn't the biggest fan of the black dragon roll (eel and avocado topped rolled with tempura shrimp) The unagi had some tiny bones in it and wasn't as saucy as I would've liked.  2 thumbs up for the service. Very rarely do Asian restaurants which you're not paying exorbitant amounts for check up on you and ask how your meal is. This one did.  Protip: Rolls in bento boxes can be substituted. Ie. California and salmon for spicy salmon. Try the spicy salmon, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Very solid sushi place, can't really add much more than everyone else just add to the general vibe that you won't be disappointed here.  Friendly staff and good food at a decent price, if you are reading this on your phone because you are nearby then go there."}
{"text":"If you're in the east, anywhere on the east side of Toronto, make sure to drop in to Ni Ji for a meal.   It's a small, family run sushi restaurant, not fancy, yet quite comfortable and clean. I think this is the type of restaurant you'd come to for a casual dinner with friends or family. There is a large variety of very reasonably priced specials on the menu.  The service was understandably rushed during both visits, but the waitress was still very attentive to our requests for orders and the like.  I will definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"I wasn't feeling too well but went out with my friends on a Saturday night.   Just as I as hoping, Niji was pretty good! I ordered Bento #6 that included miso soup, congee, salad, several tempura, 3 Cali/3 salmon rolls, and 12 assorted sushi. I cleared the box! I thought the sushi had too little rice, but that's only my preference. Tempura had the perfect amount of batter, and everything was pretty fresh. I wasn't expecting ice cream, so that was a bonus.  Service was polite and attentative. They refilled our cups with tea several times. Unfortunately, tea was not hot, which would have been nice. They also gave us our bill before we even asked. I guess the restaurant was starting to get busy by 7:30pm.  Bottom line, worth a try!"}
{"text":"Excellent Value.  To preface my review, I am a weekly sushi junkie.  Visited Ni Ji Sushi for the first time today and ordered #73 - 13 pieces nigiri, 3 pieces Cali roll, 3 pieces salmon roll for $13.95.  This set included a miso soup, salad, congee, glass noodle appetizer, another small appetizer of greens with hot sauce, and a scoop of green tea ice cream for dessert.  This is a ridiculous amount of food for the price and, after tasting, I can see why Ni Ji Sushi is highly rated.  Let's start with the nigiri.  I immediately noticed how generous the portions of fish were and the fish-to-rice ratio was about 5:1.  This is their unique selling point.  The fish and rice were fresh and delicious;  the baseline for Japanese restaurants.  The 13-piece nigiri components included 6 pieces salmon, 2 pieces red tuna, 1 piece hokkigai (surf clam), 1 piece red snapper, 1 piece ebi (cooked shrimp), and 1 piece bbq eel.    The California rolls and salmon rolls were also tasty but nothing superior to note.  Plus one point for the combo's three included small appetizers on top of the typical soup and salad.  A bowlette (yes, I made that word up) of congee, a glass-noodle dish, and a greens with hot sauce - while small and somewhat insignificant, they're still value-added.  Plus another point for throwing in a green tea ice cream for dessert.  I did not know that my meal came with dessert and, at this point, I wondered how do they make money!  It was smooth, creamy, and of the same quality as you would expect from any other Japanese restaurant.  Food aside, the atmosphere was warm and welcoming.  The decor was aesthetically appealing and wait staff accommodating - I appreciate being asked if everything is okay during the mid-meal point.  Two private seating areas are available for that special date, business meeting, or for the extreme introverts who can't stand being looked at while eating.  In summary, this is the sushi joint for you if bang-for-your-buck is most important.  Great quality fish (but not excellent as in Zen or Aoyama, obviously), huge portions of fish in their nigiri offering, more included side dishes with your meal than any other Japanese restaurant I've been to, amazing price for what you get.   Honestly, I left happy, full, and with no gripes.  My advice to them would be to offer a nigiri set of 10 pieces - each of a different fish.  This is what I always order when I go for sushi and was a bit disappointed when I couldn't find it on their menu.  I was getting pretty tired of eating salmon as I neared end-of-meal.  That's all you need to now.  Stop reading reviews and go ahead to Ni Ji Sushi!  Side note:  if you're a calorie counter, this entire meal is approximately 650 calories.  Not bad!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for several years, my go to spot, everyone I bring has come back again and again. The owners are friendly, the quality of sushi is the best I've had.  The sushi here is always consistent. By far my favourite restaurant!"}
{"text":"I love this place.. A neighborhood gem.. Great sushi and sashimi, good service, and close to my home and work."}
{"text":"It totally needs help with the wait time. Honestly, every time I go (no matter what time I go), there's too many people and too little waiters. So it takes forever to get a seat and it takes forever to get the food.  So that's the start, once you get seated, you are served tea and menu (as usual).  Sushi there I found was very mediocre. Some days it's good, some days it's not. When we head to sushi places, we find that consistency is key. It means you are getting the fish from a good source.   If you ask me if I would come back, honestly, I wouldn't waste my time. I'd probably go somewhere where there's better and faster service as well as consistent quality of food"}
{"text":"Came here two times now and both times I ordered the sashimi be to box which costs around $24. A little expensive but for the amount not of sashimi and for the quality of it, it's worth your money! I didn't count how many were in I'm but it included soup, salad, and congee (super yummy!!), sashimi, sushi, rolls, and tempura. To finish off, they serve ice cream. Each piece was so thickly cut too! It'll leave you feeling full and for me, I has to pack up what I couldn't finish and use it as lunch for the following day.   The service was good, not much to say about. The place is located is on a small plaza (?) and there's not much parking. The place is also small and always packed, whether it'd be a weekday or weekend dinner."}
{"text":"This place has a fruit fly problem and I couldn't enjoy my meal when I was trying to swat flies. It ended up landing on our food. Gross.  We've been here before and they didn't have this problem before.   It doesn't look good when staff had fly swatters."}
{"text":"What is wrong with all the positive ratings on here. This place is such a Joke( they are super busy here I guess no competition is the key) Last time i had sushi on Church street they undercooked their rice... this time here is even worse...  overcooked rice, no texture, extremely sweet...nothing stands out here. It's like eating McDonald's burger. You don't know what you gonna get or sometimes just like oh well it's food eat it ... I am not gonna eat sushi anytime soon again...shame on those chefs who don't care about their crafts, then you are no different than a tool?"}
{"text":"We came here for lunch on a Wednesday and it was quite busy - we had to wait around 10 minutes for a two-person table. All the staff here are extremely friendly, and the entire atmosphere was very welcoming. We ordered the Love Boat, which comes with sushi, sashimi, and maki, as well as a few different sides. It was definitely more than enough for two people. There is also a family boat for four people which I hear has pretty large portions. I have had better salads at other Japanese restaurants, but overall their food was great quality.   We did receive and pay our bill right after ice cream was served, but didn't feel rushed to finish the dessert or vacate our table. I think this restaurant offers fair prices for good food, and would definitely come back."}
{"text":"This gem hidden in northlands of Scarborough is hands down the best all-round Japanese restaurant I have been to.  Everything from their hand-rolls, bento boxes, sizzling hot plates and plentiful bowls of udon noodle soup is simply delicious.  The meals are beautifully presented, with most opening with a miso soup, garden salad with an homemade vinaigrette dressing of what tastes of carrot and apple?, seaweed in a spicy sauce, charred pickerel and congee.  Everything is delicious however I have a particular fondness for their tempura sweet potato maki roll.  Simply one of the greatest Japanese restaurant around"}
{"text":"Really bad experience. When we were having lunch The waitress was keep coming couple times ask us \" are you still working on this \" & \" are you done\". But never service water or something else. And was not busy there when we having lunch. Won't go back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing and taste great if you're not in the mood for AYCE. This is my go-to place when I'm not starving but craving some good sushi. The bento boxes are always a good choice of order and their Sashimi's are delicious, big portions too. The atmosphere is great after the renovation and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"I have been going to Niji for the last 5 years. My sister and I always get the love boat combination which comes with tempura, sushi, sashimi and bulgogi. A great deal for $39.99 but I remember when it was $29.99 which was even a better deal. However, I understand inflation. There is enough food to feed 2-3 people. I always substitute the salmon sushi for their spicy salmon. I've eaten at many sushi places across the GTA and I am not sure if it's the nostalgia but their spicy salmon is delicious and my all time favorite. They cut up the pieces of salmon and combine it with their spicy sauce and then create a roll with that mixture. They also top off their spicy salmon with extra prices of salmon.  The service is always warm and friendly. I would recommend making a reservation for groups of 6 and more. I would also recommend going early on the weekends to avoid waiting in line. I have also tried their bento boxes and main dishes of salmon. The value is incredible and I love how they incorporate Korean dishes onto their menu. The restaurant is owned by Koreans. Lastly, I appreciate how they start each meal with miso soup and salad (with an amazing ginger dressing) and congee (I am not sure how they make this congee so delicious!) and provide green tea ice cream to end a meal. If you are in Scarborough- I would recommend a visit!"}
{"text":"I got take-out from Ni Ji yesterday and I will give it 4 stars! I got the Green Dragon and it was very tasty! The place is quite small on the inside, just several tables at the most, and that's good. It's good because the bigger sushi restaurants will be busy and your sushi won't be exactly at it's prime when it arrives to your table. I recommend this place if you lie in Scarborough and want great sushi!"}
{"text":"I ordered take out from this place yesterday... everything was good. It was on discount too. So I got 6 pc cali roll, tempura pieces combo (rice, salad, soup) for $19~ Which is decent. However, about four hours later, I began to throw up and felt nauseous/abdominal cramping/ and vomiting which are signs of food poisoning.  The tempura was saggy/foggy (it felt wet/too much oil or something).   The cali roll didn't feel/taste right - it felt like as if they gave me left overs from someone else' food. Hopefully they didn't. Anywho, never going back to that place again. Going to stick with Tian ichi restaurant - a lot better than this place."}
{"text":"An amazing sushi place in the sea of sushi available in the area. I can definitely see why they earn their high ratings and crowd of loyal followers. I came on a Saturday for light lunch and decided to share the special bento dinner between two people. It comes with a miso soup, a salad, a small bowl of congee, the bento dinner and ice cream!  It's a lot of food for around $30 after tip and tax. For one person, it's a little expensive but it would have been a feast.   They obviously use a high quality of ingredients. Each piece of fish was sweet, with no tendons,  and they didn't skimp on the size. Each sashimi was sizable and thick so you could really sink your teeth into it. The rice is obviously fresh and they took the time to season it correctly so it enhanced the flavor of the sushi or the maki. Everything was delicious and I will be back for more next time I'm craving sushi!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying my boyfriend isn't a fan of sushi. But he loves this place! I usually get the salmon teriyaki bento and he enjoys the veggie bento. Salmon teriyaki bento box comes with green salad and miso soup as well as some other soup that I can't name. The service is great and the food is high quality, in my opinion. We come here often and it never fails. Definitely worth at least one visit in your lifetime."}
{"text":"One of my favourite sushi places in Toronto. Good quality and decent prices. My favourite go to sushi place!"}
{"text":"Niji is my go to sushi restaurant in Scarborough.  It is very popular and with good reason!  The sushi is very fresh and the prices are modest.  There is great selection and you get a lot of food for great value.  Sometimes it's hard to get a tea refill but when you get a hold of the waitress they will bring you some fairly quickly.  My favourite meal is 'Sapporo Sushi' - it includes 1 salmon hand roll, 3 california rolls, 3 salmon rolls, 8 pieces assorted sushi, miso soup, salad and scoop of green tea ice-cream for desert.  Delicious.  I definitely recommend dining here!"}
{"text":"They have amazing food portions, quality and service here! They even have a sashimi bento box selection during lunch! They give you a small bowl of congee, miso soup, and a salad for appetizer whilst filling each section of your bento box! The price is also decent! ! I suggest coming here as soon as their lunch time opens to get a seat because it gets busy! Other than that, Will recommend and come here time and time again"}
{"text":"I love this cute little sushi restaurant in the East end! It's difficult to find a quality sushi restaurant in scarborough that's open late and has quality food.  The dinner menu is typical for a sushi place but the quality of the food is great and the service is wonderful. The server was so helpful and pleasant.   This is our new go to sushi place"}
{"text":"Yelp has failed me :( I decided to try out Ni Ji Sushi today based on how much everyone seems to love it. Parking is quite difficult here especially because the restaurant shares a lot with an auto shop. There was actually no parking when I went today so I actually parked in the plaza across from Ni Ji where Roll N Bowl is.  Inside the atmosphere is nice. A bit small but not bad. We had lunch specials and price wise it is quite wallet friendly. Lunch specials come with miso soup (quite bland which is surprising as most places overdo it), salad, and congee (both were good).  I got a sushi lunch (9 dollars). This includes around 5 pieces of sushi (one red tuna, 3 salmon, 1 white tuna). It also includes 6 maki (3 california and 3 salmon the size of a dollar). In the bento box there is a bit of japchae... I wish they had given more as it was good. A a strange thing I've never seen before - thin strips of cut up yam and onion fried with tempura batter in a clump. This was obviously not fresh and it wasn't warm at all and very chewy. I took one bite and didn't eat it.  The fish was actually the best part I'm happy to say! The fish is sliced thinly (though not paper thin) but the pieces themselves are quite large so the rice to fish ratio is very good. The salmon tasted good as did the red tuna. White tuna was just okay but maybe I'm just not a fan of that.  We also got a chicken teriyaki bento box which contained the same sides. The chicken was very dry and was white meat rather than dark. Not good and quite bland (tasteless chicken with teriyaki sauce on top).  While it is very cheap, we came away disappointed. There are similar sushi places out there with similar prices, good quality, and bigger portions. I wonder if coming here for dinner might be a better idea."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been a go-to since my husband and I had first started dating and it still impresses us to this day (weekly diners!). The service is always friendly, the portions are generous and the prices are reasonable. If you want a frou-frou experience, go downtown. But if you want delicious food in a clean, comfortable and cozy atmosphere; then visit Ni Ji. Just one small issue: this tiny place fills up so quickly during the lunch and dinner times (a clear indication of excellent food); so make sure you are prepared to wait."}
{"text":"Hands DOWN the BEST sushi pizza I've ever had, anywhere. Also really good jap chae, but seriously? Go for the sushi pizza. Their teriyaki is fairly average, but their lunch menu is definitely a good deal. Good appy's too."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch if your nearby the area. Honestly, nothing but positive things to say. Service is always FAST! I place my order and they have it ready in 10-15 minutes for pick up, which is great if your trying to beat the lunch traffic. If you choose to sit in, service is still fast. I usually don't have to wait for a seat and I go with a group of 4. Personal favourite is the sushi lunch and paying an extra $1 to upgrade my rolls to the spicy salmon. My total bill is usually about $9-10 for take-out"}
{"text":"This place offers solid sushi and other Japanese/Korean dishes in a area of Scarborough that is a bit of a desert in terms of good sushi.  The place seems family run and the staff is friendly and are quick.  They have good lunch specials and I really like their bento boxes.  I would recommend this place and I like the fact it is not ayce."}
{"text":"Based on all the good reviews I had to see what all the fuss was about. On a Monday afternoon the parking was full. Not even a single spot to spare. Had to wait for someone to leave. Inside the restaurant is just as small and almost all the tables were full. We got seated next to the heater which I though was prime time seating but it ended up being a disadvantage for the food. While eating my nicely chilled sashimi I noticed it was a bit warm and I soon realized the heat next to us was blowing hot air right into my tuna.  Ended up getting the $22.95 sushi bento box and another small lunch special bento box for $13.95 and also the tuna belly for $5.95. The tuna belly came first and on the menu it said 3 pieces but they were nice enough to throw in an extra piece (plus 0.5 stars for the generosity). The tuna belly is definitely different from the standard tuna sashimi. It was more pale in color instead of pinky/red and it was more fatty. I savored every moment that piece of fish was in my mouth and resisted swallowing until the last minute.   The bento boxes were also generously filled with tuna, salmon, octopus, and white tuna. There was also tempura shrimp, sweet potato and an onion ring for kicks. Fresh seaweed was also part of the meal with congee and salad. I was so stuffed when I finished my own dish and on top of that I had to finish my guests dish as well since Asian girls are petite eaters. I thought this was great...more for me but this time I could barely finish all the food. For the price I was very happy with the quantity of food. The fish is fresh but I did notice that the white tuna sashimi was a bit overly frozen. Service was also really quick and we got frequent check ups to see how we were enjoying our meals.   A solid 3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Does sushi get this cheap and still maintain the quality?! I'm surprised.  I didn't know such a restaurant existed until the waitress invited me on my way to the nearby Subway resturant.   The lunch specials come with rolls, beef-ribs, glass noodles, and calamaris/tempura shrimp.  Price to Quality = Amazing. Service is quick as well. :)"}
{"text":"Food: 3.5  Service: 3  I'm not so sure what all the hype is about, about this place. I certainly found this place below average from my first and probably last visit. I came to this place upon the reviews I was reading from this very site.   I was surprisingly disappointed in all the hype people were giving this place. Personally, it's not that great. I went for lunch and got a Sashimi bento box which came with rice, salmon sashimi, yam tempura, a few pieces of maki rolls and the usual soup and salad before your main meal. What I did like about this place, which alot of places don't usually give was they gave Congee as an extra appetizer with the salad and soup.   Everything in the bento box was standard, nothing too special, ( wasn't expecting to be wow'ed anyways) but the most disappointing part was the yam tempura. It wasn't even warm or crunchy. It came out cold and soggy. It tasted pretty bad too.    The service was mediocre the waitress didn't even talk to us, and when I asked if I can get a water and 2 teas, she had only brought 1 water.. So i had to ask her again to bring out 2 teas.  It doesn't make sense to just bring out 1 water and have the other person sit there  without anything to drink.. So service wasn't that great either.   In the end, price was decent. But I don't think I will be going back there for lunch or dinner. The quality of the food is just normal, nothing really special and plus service wasn't that friendly either while I was there."}
{"text":"The biggest draw for this place is definitely the atmosphere. It's great for big parties (think family gatherings - 15+ people), but it's also great for quaint and smaller groups (4 people booths are amazing!).  I've been coming to this place for a while - but I haven't left a review for fear of inaccurately representing how much of a gem this place is in the GTA as a whole. I'll try to break down my experience anyway, but you might see this review updated a few times over the next few months, based on my next experiences (of which I will definitely try to mix up my selections - since I always used to get the same dish).  Pros: - Big platters are great - \"Family Boat\" (for 4) and \"Love Boat\" (for 2) are great meal ideas for families / groups of 2 or 4, because of the amount of food they give you. I'm always consistently full when I eat this, regardless of how hungry I am going in. - Massive variety in the sushi / sashimi platters. If you fancy a particular type of sushi / sashimi, you will love their selection - literally pages upon pages of these! - Variety in other parts of the menu as well - they have some Korean-like options, in addition to the standard Japanese meat / tempura / appetizer dishes. - Great quality of fish in the sushi/sashimi served. I'm always happy with the quality of fish, and never have had a bad cut or gotten sick from this place! - Ratio of food for price. I have to say that I'm always full when I come here, well before the oranges/dessert comes out, if only because of the sheer amount of food they give you. - Generous portion and slice sizes of the sashimi. Most places will slice them thinner - these are about 1/2cm thick, which is exactly the way I prefer it. - They give you salad / soup / rice-like thing with every combo -- while small, it's always nice to start off your meal with a great taste in your mouth! - They (well, I think!) have low-sodium soy sauce. This thing is awesome for long bouts of eating sushi.  Cons: - Lack of free customizability of sushi combinations (you pay an extra fee, usually $1, for changing things in any combination). - Lack of seating - this place is definitely outgrowing its space, and should probably seek to expand if it wants to continue -- I consistently see lines going all the way out the door towards the Subway behind the restaurant. - Lack of variety in the \"combination bentos\" - you get what they give you, but I suspect this may be due to the overwhelming variety in the sushi platters. - This may just sound like a useless gripe, but: Not that many deals or \"rotations\" offered. The menu is always the same, and while that's great for some people, I like little bits of change and improvement when needed. - service can get spotty when the place gets a little busy. I've had times there where the tea/water is replenished within a minute, and others where I've had to get up and ask for it at the desk. Same thing with ordering and the bill -- and this happens in a variety of instances where the place is mildly full or completely empty.  It's the pros that set it high where it is, but it's the cons that make me cap the experience at a solid 4/5. It's definitely better quality than the nearby Super Sushi House, but at the expense of extra cost. It has a more distinct Japanese feel to it, if only because of the back (large) room for bigger groups, or the small 4-person booths at the front of the restaurant.  Overall, I'd definitely recommend this place if you're in the mood for a solid sushi / Japanese food experience in the GTA, and you don't want to break the bank!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today and was pleasantly surprised by quality and quantity.  I ordered the Sushi bento and it came out more food than expected and high quality.  First was salad then miso soup than a variety of 3 other small banchan dishes.  Bento came out and was a great size which was really appreciated!  Restaurant was packed for lunch and with the 34C weather and door opening and closing AC just dribbled out!"}
{"text":"This place is packed on a weekday evening during dinner time. We got seated and after taking a long long time to decide on our order, (we were really indecisive - or rather, I was really indecisive and couldn't just pick one dish but didn't have the stomach to eat 3 dishes) we ended up settling on the Special Bento ($23), with a side order of chicken yakitori ($8) and edamame ($4).   The Special Bento came with 5 pc sushi, 6 rolls, 6 pc tempura, 12 pc sashimi, salad, seaweed appetizer, and a surf clam and shrimp appetizer. Also came with soup and ice cream for dessert. Since there was only one bowl of soup but two of us, the server kindly offered to bring us an extra soup. How nice. Though since I'm not a fan of miso soup, my friend got two :)   The yakitori came out first. Two huge skewers with vegetables. Super tasty!   Edamame came out next - huge platter for $4 - such a deal.   I really enjoyed the green salad. Wonderful flavours mixed in. Not too salty. Perfect me thinks!   Everything tasted good. Nothing outstanding but good nevertheless. I would have given this place a 3 but then they also gave us a free ice cream since we only get one with our order. Free food + friendly service gave them brownie points so I bumped it up to a 4 :)"}
{"text":"Went here based on the reviews and was very disappointed.  $27 after tax for 12 pieces of maki, miso soup 4 shrimp tempuras wasn't worth it.  The maki portions were small compared to most places I go to.  The spicy tuna and salmon were a lot spicier than what i'm used to.  I also found the maki to be very salty.  Staff were friendly and service was quick."}
{"text":"So I came here again during the weekend because I thought they still had the lunch special. Definitely pricey if you're paying the usual price. The quality of the sashimi was pretty bad when I came last Saturday afternoon. They cut the fish the wrong way so it was very difficult to chew. The fish was too lean and when u cut it the wrong way u can taste all the tendons. Texture is super important when it comes to sashimi and honestly I don't know how they can mess up the cut...  I had the bento, sashimi and a roll with my mom and sister. All of them were the same. Particularly the red dragon roll- the salmon on top was so lean and so hard to chew. I have never had salmon or raw fish in general where the fish is as stiff as overcooked meat...The server was nice and gave all of us complimentary starters and dessert. We didn't bother mentioning the cut btw so it was just a nice thing she did for us. But ya basically don't come here during the weekend. My mom went back this Monday and everything was good."}
{"text":"This hidden gem is was recommended by a friend. Extremely friendly staff, in-point with topping up water and tea, includes a small app of congee, salad, miso soup, and a scoop of green tea ice cream. I ordered BBQ eel bento box with maki and sashimi. Sashimi was fresh, and good size.   Definitely going to be a regular sushi spot now!"}
{"text":"+.5 for service  My sushi adventures continue, this time heading east to Scarborough to visit Ni Ji Sushi due to their great reviews.   The good thing about this restaurant is that it's bigger than it looks. The entrance is actually in the parking lot side, not the side facing Midland/Ellesmere, hence why it seems to small from the outside.  I arrived at exactly noon and the place was quite full already. We eventually reached full seating capacity 20 minutes later, though nobody had to wait for a table since the loads kept coming in and out.  As with other sushi restaurants, the waitress immediately served me with tea. I will begin by saying I really like the tea in this sushi restaurant, as it had that Korean rice feel to it. Eventually I decided on ordering the sashimi lunch, as I'm not a huge fan of bento boxes or any sort of combination lunches.  My lunch came with a bowl of rice (duh...), green salad, some corn-like cream soup, and a miso soup. The green salad was quite standard, and the cream soup was on the cold side. The miso soup, on the other hand, was very hot to start. The flavour was a bit bland, but it definitely has less salt content than other restaurants that serve miso soup.  The sashimi lunch claimed to have 12 pieces, but I must have gotten at least 20. The salmon was probably one of the freshest I've eaten and the red snapper was quite decent, however the tuna was not of the best quality, and the butterfish felt partially frozen despite me letting it thaw out for a long time. For $12.95, it wouldn't have been worth it if I got the advertised 12 pieces, but since I got 20 or so pieces I won't bump it down to 2.5 stars.  Service was great the whole way, and you get a free orange once you pay the bill. Waitresses will come by to check if everything is okay with your food, which is always a good thing.  In terms of coming back, however, I wouldn't be too quick on that. This place, despite the current 4-star rating, is nowhere near some of the best sushi restaurants I've been to given price tier.

{"text":"I must say that the last time I came back to Ni Ji, the service was slightly better. The food seems to be well-prepared and the fish seems to be more fresh than I had remembered in the past. This place has definitely become more busy in the last few years though, particularly at lunch time! For a sushi place in Scarborough, I would say it's one of the better competitors out there."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love dinning here. The quality of their food is amazing - and this is coming from a vegan. My boyfriend orders their sashimi bento every time, and I was told they're always fresh. Their veggie bento is delicious, their rice is creamy, and they let you sub out items you don't want! If you're a vegan, don't eat their starter congee, it contains fish!"}
{"text":"Solid budget sushi joint for lunch. The service is fast and efficient and they bring you orange slices at the end. It's usually busy for weekday lunches so call ahead and reserve. The lunch specials are around $10-12 with a lot of food - great value. Not only do you get the standard salad and miso soup, there is also a small bowl of congee included. The sushi tastes relatively fresh. It's not super fancy in any way, just your usual salmon, tuna, shrimp. I tried the chicken teriyaki and it was good -- no grizzly fat pieces like you find in some places. I found the tempura a bit greasy/too much batter."}
{"text":"This is my favourite restaurant in Toronto!  I can't say enough about how wonderful this place is.  I've been eating here for at least 13 years.  Large portions, good prices and fantastic tasting food.  I've sampled almost everything on the menu and have not been disappointed.  There are a few things I don't like the taste or texture of but others loved it. Service is prompt and pleasant."}
{"text":"This review is based on over 20+ visits in the last 5  years or so....  Great place with good food at a decent price.  By now I have had most items on the menu and have been impresed with both the food and the service.  It seems to be a fairly consistent place which is why I keep going. I have also ordered party trays from here before and have been very pleased with them.  I will keep going back"}
{"text":"The food was amazing! The sashimi was fresh and generously portioned. Service was also great. Our server though told us we were lucky to be seated right away, there is usually a line up starting  7 pm on Friday nights  My husband and I ordered the loveboat, it came with extras you wouldn't get at other Japanese restaurants such as the tempura, beef bulgolgi and rice.   Our server was extremely attentive, tea was always filled and we were checked on more than 3 times to ensure we were happy. This is now officially our new sushi hangout!"}
{"text":"I would never have come here if I hadn't read Melissa J.'s review.   Ni Ji was a pleasant surprise, when you consider the quantity and quality you get for their awesome prices.    The barley tea here is quite fragrant, and the owners here have proudly confirmed that it is far more popular than traditional green tea.  The free appetizers - bland tofu with watered-down sauce and a little dish of congee - I found were lackluster and might as well have been left out.  The seaweed, slathered with a spicy red sauce, was also a bit incongruous.  And although the edamame was a good start, it just seemed odd to be given five individual pieces.   The vegetable tempura and maki bento set is a steal for $7.95; most combinations here start at $8 and don't fare more than $12 at most. Each of the maki rolls were stuffed with a ginormous amount of fresh avocado, perfectly ripened. Succulent chap chae noodles (minus the vegetables), and carefully pickled-daikon make a nice contrast to the mains. The tempura batter here isn't bad and Ni Ji doesn't skimp out; there is green pepper, long beans, button mushrooms, sweet poatoes, an onion ring and even zuccini. It's nice to know that the cooks pay attention to the finer details as well; even the tempura dipping sauce has a sweet smell of ginger.  The formula of giving free appetizer works, since not too many places around Scarborough do this anymore.  However, other Japanese/Korean eateries like Han River (Sheppard/Pharmacy) offer better choices where the dishes don't taste like they're free.    The lunch specials at Ni Ji, which run between 11:30 am - 3:00 pm make the visit worthwhile.  A fantastic deal where you won't leave hungry."}
{"text":"This is my new favourite Sushi place in Scarborough!  I used to go to the Sushi House on Kennedy & Ellesmere but that place has gone downhill. I thought I'd give this a try and how nice this little place is. Company and I ordered the Love Boat to share and it was plenty!  I patiently waited for my salad and miso and was so surprised when I was offered congee, seaweed and glass noodles - BONUS!  The sushi itself was fresh and delish. Service was fast as can be (this place is always packed) and friendly.  To top it all off we were given a little scoop was green tea icecream.  I was so happy with this place I've been a few times and I've always had a great experience."}
{"text":"This sushi restaurant like many others offers a comforting environ and canopy-like booths with hard yet comfortable seating in a dimly-lit cabana of a restaurant. Order a bento box for a variety of rolls, chicken slivers and honey drizzled tofu, which, as a matter of fact, was extremely light, quite fresh and in my eyes;The best dish in my box.The avocado rolls were tasty, crunchy but the seaweed wrapping was a little peculiar in taste.The diagonally-placed chicken slivers in my box were nice.. Not too tough and not too soft.The service was good although slow but staff courteous! Lovely atmosphere."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi and sashimi. HIGH QUALITY Salmon Sashimi!!!!! Staff were very friendly and quick. Highly recommend. They also gave us extra sushi pieces."}
{"text":"Wow!  Pleasantly surprised!!!  Came here for dinner last night with a friend, not expecting much.  I ordered Bento box #6 which included tempura (two shrimp, two sweet potato, onion ring), 10 pieces of sushi, 3 California rolls, 3 maki, fried tofu.  This bento also included salad, miso, and rice soup to start, and a scoop of green tea ice cream to finish.  I also placed an order of uni.   The portions, quality for the value, are fantastic!  A very casual, hidden gem for sushi in Scarborough...would return when in the area."}
{"text":"When we dine out for dinner, we focus both on food and atmosphere. The food here might not be the best, but I have to say that the environment is quite comfortable, I feel extremely happy and seems like my day has been cheered up by this adorable place"}
{"text":"Amazing quality sushi for Toronto (including compared to sushi found down down)!  Ordered \"special bento\" #00 (last one on the last page) for first time. Impressive! Came with tempura,6 pcs small sushi rolls, 5-6 pcs sushi, and 12-15 pcs sashimi + sunomono salad. As well as Japanese salad, congee, and miso soup....& one small scoop of green tea ice cream. All for $22.95! See pic #17 - that's exactly what I had.   My only mild dissatisfaction is around their miso soup - it's nothing special. And that a tall can of Saporo cost almost $10.   The rest was delicious. I can eat a lot of sushi but I couldn't even finish it and took the rest home for lunch the next day. Love coming here! I'm so happy they're open again!"}
{"text":"Dined here yesterday for the first time. My friends eat here often. It's important to note that they're vegetarian and I'll explain why.   I am not. I eat everything.   Initially, we were taken to be seated in the back, near the chef's kitchen. I'm sensitive to smells, particularly unpleasant ones. There was a fishy stench that made me sick. I asked to sit elsewhere.  We moved closer to the entrance, which minimized the fishy odor. However, that was not compelling enough for me to order any dish with fish. Remember when I said I'm not vegetarian and eat everything? In this case, I opted for everything vegetarian. I once had a previous experience elsewhere with soiled sashimi, resulting in an awful case of food poisoning. Took me months until I could eat sushi again and did not want a repeat!  I ordered the 6 piece California and 10 piece yam and avocado rolls with a miso soup and received a garden salad on the house. Love their dressing! The avocado and yam roll was delicious! Big pieces, good filling to rice ratio and very satisfying. I was stuffed or else would have ordered more of that yummy roll.  Resturant cleanliness = 5/5, including washroom.  Being a fan of sashimi and fresh sushi, the resturant loses two stars. The fishy odor and colour of the fish were a turn off. 3/5, even though the one veggie roll I had was a hit.  Service and wait times = 5/5.  Overall, 3.5/5. Would return for that avocado yam roll, miso soup and house salad."}
{"text":"Just had dinner here. Everything was really good. We had the spicy salmon maki, unagi, dragon maki, and spider maki. All very good. We also got an appetizer sized japche. it was tasty but found it to be a bit oily. Excellent service. I had been wanting to try this place for a while now and so glad I got the chance tonight. Would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I give this a 4 stars because it's considered as good for this type of regular sushi restaurant. They have miso , Congee and salad for appetizer and green tea ice cream for dessert. But of course they come for free if you get the combo.  Good price for the quality and quantity."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today. We each got the lunch combo special ($11.99) which comes with chicken teriyaki, tempura, miso soup, glass noodles, rice, and 6 pieces of California roll. Wasn't impressed that you had to pay an additional 2$ to substitute from California to a different Maki roll. We decided to order an extra 6 pcs of spicy Salmon sushi which we prefer. Food was good and served very quickly. I prefer AYCE but this is a good option if you aren't looking to completely stuff your face."}
{"text":"A great tiny place with pretty good sashimi & portions for a decently low price. :D   Also the waitresses are nice and cute. Omg I just realized all of the servers are young cute girls. All of them.  Also if you like the low sodium soy sauce, they have it but you gotta ask. (idk why they don't just put both on the table)"}
{"text":"This was amazing. My boyfriend and I indulged in a sashimi boat, the sashimi-sushi combo, and a roll, and it was all excellent, very fresh, and generously portioned. The roll, on the menu, said 6 pieces, but it was a full roll. The sashimi, especially the salmon, was incredible, fresh and with good color and fat. The meal came with a salad, soup, and green tea ice cream scoop, and the prices were great.   I was very impressed, and will dream about this sushi night for a while. I wish I could eat here again, and if I'm ever near Toronto I just might"}
{"text":"Great lunch prices and always busy. The sushi is my favourite on the menu- got four pieces, as well as a roll, and each sushi had some flavouring under the fish which was delicious - looked like a bit of wasabi paste? Tempura came in a big block all together with yam and onions, however, so you can't separate the pieces but rather eat them together as a clump."}
{"text":"This is not a 4 star sushi joint. First of all sushi is small and they break apart. One server kept coming to us when we just sat down and kept coming every 1 minute and ask us are you ready, we told her 3 times we need like 5 mins.. i wanted to try this place since it was close by from where we were and it was bad and it's so salty that you don't need soy sauce. Also last not least they charge you a dollar for sauce that's ridiculous and I only wanted spicy mayo. I am not coming back here ever."}
{"text":"Such a cute little restaurant with friendly workers! They greet you as soon as the door rings when it opens and as soon as you get up from your seat to leave. Firstly they serve you with salad, congee & miso soup, then they bring ice water & tea. I got myself a Salmon Bibimbap (rice, vegetables, salmon, egg, & spicy sauce) served on a hot stone bowl & my boyfriend got himself a Beef Bulgogi (bento box served with japchae noodles, raddish, steamed rice, beef bulgogi, & 1 salmon maki roll & 1 spicy salmon maki roll). We also got a side of a Red Dragon Roll (raw salmon on top, shrimp tempura, cucumber, avocado, tobiko & a sauce on the bottom). The prices are made by the options given on the menu, although they allowed me to make substitutions for reasonable up charges which I chose to do. Overall I had a great experience with a great view from my table, I highly suggest this restaurant if you are craving for sushi & are avoiding AYCE!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend found out about this place from a friend of his that insisted we go there for lunch. Since then we've been going at least once a week because of all the great food you get for under $10 a person. It is definitely my favourite sushi spot in Toronto."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner tonight and had a pleasant experience overall. I ordered the salmon teriyaki bento box which came with salad, miso soup, and California rolls. My husband ordered the same plus a side of spicy salmon sushi.  The salmon sushi was very fresh and tasty. It was better than the spicy salmon sushi in other restaurants.  The salmon teriyaki itself was delicious. I enjoyed every bit of it!  All of the food there was light and tasty.   Service was polite and courteous, although we did have to ask for our tea to be refilled. But anything that was asked for came promptly.   Overall, I would recommend NiJi Sushi. The food is enjoyable and the service was good too."}
{"text":"I was disappointed with the service I received today. We ordered a rainbow roll and a Osaka sushi, not only did they not offer me appetizers but I did not even receive a soya sauce tray. I understand the appetizers I guess... but soya sauce containers do not cost the business any more money to serve to customers. The waitress was aware the customers weren't happy and still did not offer an appetizer to me. I would 10/10 not come back because of the service and care for the customers."}
{"text":"A great little local Japanese restaurant. The food is always delicious, well priced, & service is great! Decor has been refreshed a little since I was last here. We were here during lunch hour on a Saturday. And it did get busy. Note: there's only 1 washroom each for men & women so sometimes you have to line up. That's the only thing I can complain about!"}
{"text":"Scarbarians can celebrate! Niji has finally reopened after months of renovation.   We visited 3 days after their re-opening for dinner and it was PACKED! Renovations are great, lots of seating but definitely not enough for the amount of people who visit. Prepare to wait a bit, both for a table and for the food. They're doing their best and everyone is SUPER busy. When I went to pay the entire table was FULL of take-out orders as well.   Quality is still amazing! I believe prices have gone up a bit, but still affordable.   Great place, welcome back Niji! :)"}
{"text":"This is one of those rare occasions when Yelp has totally failed me. I was deceived by Ni Ji Sushi's 4-star rating.  SERVICE: 5/5. Exceptional service. Friendly. Courteous. No complaints whatsoever.  FOOD: 2/5. My maki (Alaska and Dynamite) were below average in terms of taste, quality of ingredients and portion size. I suppose you get what you pay for. I felt weird in my stomach after eating there and couldn't wait to get home to have a cup of Oolong green tea.  AMBIANCE: 4/5. Nothing special. Just like your typical \"Japanese\" restaurant with Chinese or Korean staff in a similar price range. It's hard to come by a Japanese restaurant owned and operated by Japanese people with authentic Japanese decor. Japango (122 Elizabeth St) and Hiro Sushi (171 King St E) would be examples of authentic Japanese restaurants in Toronto.  Ni Ji Sushi is probably regarded as an affordable spot for locals that don't mind the subpar quality, but I for one, won't be back at Ni Ji Sushi. I found the quality of food unsatisfactory."}
{"text":"Dined here for one of my bffs birthday.. It was okay.. Food portion was pretty small i guess for such an expensive price, nothing special about the food here. Probably won't come back again."}
{"text":"I've had so much better; I just don't seem to understand the hype. The green tea was terrible... by far the worst. And the sushi was okay. Sake sashimi again was okay. Just not extraordinary."}
{"text":"Oh man, they keep delaying their re-opening! We've been waiting for Ni Ji to re-open for months! There aren't many good sushi restaurants in Scarborough so I've been travelling farther out to satisfy my cravings! I really hope they do not increase the prices too much upon re-opening."}
{"text":"Service is great. Waiting time is decent. Pricing is decent. Selection is limited. Presentation is not that great. Interior is not the best- don't come for the ambience.  Overall, good for quick, casual sushi cravings where you leave moderately satisfied."}
{"text":"I was craving sushi and pass there once a week on my way to work in this part of town. I only went based on recommendations I read here. I ordered to go - salmon sashimi (20 pc) and spicy scallop hand roll. It was ok. I thought the scallop would've been raw, but it wasn't, but it was still good, I just wouldn't have ordered it if I had known. While I was waiting for my order, I saw all the beautiful combo plates they were making for people dining in. I wish I had ordered a bento or some combo instead; would've been much better value. Every thing looked great, better than what I ordered - but that's not their fault. The tempura looked great! I intended to dine in next time. ... keep y'all posted :)"}
{"text":"Back here for dinner...  Menus here are just so dirty and caked with whatever...  Service definitely really rushed and I feel a little pressured to finish everything as fast as possible!   Love Boat ($32.99) Dinner for 2 was good value as in quantity. But the white tuna was half frozen, the rolls was loosely rolled, the freshness of the fish was meh. Had a hard time even finishing that because of the quality.  I don't think I will be back..."}
{"text":"I love Ni Ji. It's close to where I grew up, so I've had a lot of experience with Scarborough sushi in general, and a couple years ago, Ni Ji won the sushi war.  First of all, it's amazingly cheap -- you can get so much food for next to nothing. If you go for lunch, two people can eat for $18 including tax (they take 13% off if you pay cash!). Their combos have tons of neat extras, they give you deep fried tofu, congee, edamame, glass noodles and a delicious little deep-fried onion thing. All for free!  Dinner is closer to average price for a sushi place, but the quality and size of their rolls is so worth it. The service is always prompt and friendly, even when the place is jam-packed at lunchtime, you can still be in and out in half an hour.  And if you're not in the mood for the restaurant setting, their take-out is great too. We've ordered the party trays for large groups of people, and it's a great deal for a group of 6 or more. The love boat/family boat deals are really good if you want more than just sushi, they come with sushi, sashimi, tempura, teriyaki, gyoza, and all sorts of other extras, for around $10 a person or less.  It's may be out in the middle of Scarborough, but it's steps away from the Midland RT station and not too far from Scarborough Town Centre. If you're close by, it's totally worth it."}
{"text":"Newly renovated restaurant in Scarborough. Fresh tasting sushi and sashimi. Ordered 20pcs salmon sashimi and their green dragon roll and spicy salmon dragon (see photos)"}
{"text":"Definitely the best sushi spot in town. We love the friendly smiles we are always greeted with. Service is always quick. I usually get the Chicken teriyaki bento box and change my 6 makis to spicy salmon. The bento box is so delicious and packed with with food. They provide you with soup, salad and congee and finish the night off with green tea ice cream. All very tasty! Definitely our sushi place."}
{"text":"Came here after a quick movie at STC. I don't usually eat in Scarborough but decided that it was close enough and I couldn't really bother driving somewhere else for a late night meal.  I can't say I expected much and I only came here mainly because of the yelp rating, but I was pretty disappointed. Two key differentiators in Japanese restaurants are the freshness of ingredients and execution of dishes; which both Niji had failed.   I ordered a rainbow roll and a bulgogi bento box. The prices were surprisingly not cheap considering the fact that it was half a unit in the corner of a rundown building next to a subway. I've had much better meals for the same price point with much more interesting bento box pairings too. When the bulgogi arrived I felt sad; a lumpy old piece of tofu, some shredded pickled radish, ill-formed maki with old salmon, badly positioned thai rice, and chewy bulgogi each filled one section of the box. The rainbow roll used very old sashimi. The rolls were really small too because usually restaurants offered a-la carte rolls as one entire meal, which clearly was not the case as this restaurant expected you to order more. The rolls were also badly formed and fell apart very easily even with careful consumption and was extremely bland, cementomg the fact that the ingredients were incredibly unfresh. And don't even get me started on that pathetic attempt of an appetizer.  My advice is for you to come here to have your stomach filled, but not your tastes satisfied."}
{"text":"The quality of the sashimi is decent and better than AYCE. Price for quality is good."}
{"text":"I'm a regular here so they know me.  If you come on a Friday night get here before 7 or you'll wait in line.  Food quality is good, service is brisk, ambience is well I guess you could say Japanese kitsch?  They keep the Christmas decorations up all year round which adds to the charm too.  The floor is an rather strange colour but you're not eating on it so get over it.  Prices are really reasonable and you get two soups!"}
{"text":"I am anxiously waiting for their reopening which is expected on November 15, 2015. We enjoy this local Japanese restaurant. My husband and I enjoy the Love Boat for two. We preorder and take home. We set up are dining table with our Japanese dishes and have a date night. Ni Ji is always fresh and punctual. Very excited about their renovations. Anxiously waiting to place my order."}
{"text":"This place has the friendliest service that I have ever come across. I'm not even joking.  I came here with two friends for my birthday and was seated in the far back. Our waitress was very attentive and gave us adequate time to decide on our orders. Since two of our orders had miso soup and one didn't, she offered to give us an extra for free because she didn't want one of us to feel left out. That's so incredibly sweet.  The food was great! No fishiness whatsoever when it came to the sushi. We were all pretty full by the end of it, and had a generally pleasant time. I'm not surprised to see that this restaurant has so many good reviews. It really deserves it.   4.5 stars!"}
{"text":"Had dinner at Ni Ji Sushi a few weekends ago and was not at all impressed. We ended up getting a Rainbow Roll ($9.95), the Green Dragon roll ($12.95) and the Crunch Roll ($12.95)  I was extremely disappointed with the Rainbow Roll. The California roll itself was fine but the assorted fish on top of the roll seemed to be haphazardly placed on top and what really took me by surprise was that the rolls were not cut properly. Normally, I am able to pick apart the pieces easily but when I tried to pick up the pieces of this roll, some of the fish on top would stick together and when I tugged at it, the roll would begin to fall apart. My friend and I had to work together to pull apart the pieces - I would hold down one end with my chopsticks and he would rip the piece from to other end. Definitely not how a maki should be presented.  The Green Dragon roll was made a little better and but I still found the maki to not be quite as tightly rolled as I would have liked.  The Crunch Roll ($12.95) was most disappointing of all - bordering on disgusting. We should have taken a clue from the waitress when she said that she had never tried the roll. The Crunch Roll is a deep fried Dynamite roll. The shrimp tempura inside the dynamite roll is deep fried once and then rolled into a maki with some avocado, cucumber and tobiko. The whole thing is then deep fried again. The result was a very oily roll with warm chewy rice (ewww!) and warm avocado. I would recommend everyone stay away from this roll. Sushi should taste fresh - this one definitely missed the mark.  We also ordered the Sushi - Sashimi Combo ($24.95). The nigiri was ok but I found proportion of fish and rice somewhat uneven. The pieces of fish were MUCH bigger than the rice. The rice looked like it was a kid wearing clothes three sizes too big. The sashimi was a little icy and it seemed as though it was not fully defrosted.  I was quite surprised at my experience given the great reviews from yelp. Pricewise, the sushi here is much more budget friendly, but given the quality of the food here, I will probably not return."}
{"text":"This is a cozy little sushi place in Scarborough. Probably the only sushi place in scarborough you can take a date. So you'll find a lot of couples in there.  Not AYCE."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and decided to order from the sushi dinner menu. The restaurant was about a third full on a Saturday night after 9pm. Seated right away and looked through the menu. There was a lot of choices and combos available.   Ordered the Sapporo Sushi and it came with salad, congee and miso soup. Tasted the same as other restaurants but the soup was a little on the salty side. The sushi didn't take long to arrive. The colour of the fish didn't look that great, was a bit dull and didn't seem too fresh. First bite confirmed the theory, the fish was kind of mushy. Definitely bad fish for a sushi place with such a high rating. Someone made a comment that the sushi and sashimi wasn't as good as before.  Overall, with all the high rating and good reviews guess it deserves a second chance for redemption."}
{"text":"My favourite sushi east of the DVP.  This place has been around for what seems like forever.  And rightly so!  Niji is has some really great prices, and the sushi always seems to taste great.  Their Spicy Salmon maki is the best in the city, and the reason I keep going back.  They offer all your other standard sushi fare, and a selection of bento-style korean dishes.  The place is usually packed on the weekends, but the staff always remains friendly.  The chefs are right up by the entrance and they always say goodbye, a great bunch of people.  There isn't anything terribly unique about Niji.  Its an average sized establishment, with average decor.  But they just do good food at good prices, with an overall good experience.  What more do you want?"}
{"text":"Always busy here at dinner time. Was difficult to get a table on a Friday night so I usually order take out.  Sashimi and sushi are fresh.  If you're making dinner plans last minute. This is a good option."}
{"text":"This place is always busy and it's easy to see why. A great place to grab sushi if you're in the Scarborough area. The fish here is really fresh and service is quick but be prepared to wait if you're coming during prime lunch or dinner hours.   I would say this is more of a classic joint compared to Roll N Bowl (right across the street). Unlike RnB which offers torched sushi and really inventive rolls, this place has a more simple menu but still enjoyable. Would go back to try their other items."}
{"text":"best place for decent sushi fix. been here so many times. decent sushi. Lover their salmon terriyaki. good bang for your buck. This place is good for price food quality and service."}
