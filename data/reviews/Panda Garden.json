{"text":"This place is great! Not your typical Chinese food joint. Menu is traditional but the flavors are unique! You absolutely must get the GARLIC SAUCE! The sauce is unlike anything I have ever had before! I live in Texas but commute for work, and when I'm within 100 miles of this place I will make the drive to get this amazing food! Once again GARLIC SAUCE... you won't regret it"}
{"text":"EAT HERE!!! I seriously order from Panda Garden like twice a week. Everything on their menu is delicious! I'm Asian, so my grandma and my mom always cooked with fresh ingredients growing up. This place is the closest I can get that reminds me of the cooking I had when I lived at home. It's fantastic and I can never get enough of this place! My favorite Asian place to eat hands down! The owners are so nice and always make my order fast and fresh! I have several of my friends totally hooked on this place!"}
{"text":"The garlic sauce is to die for! The service is fast and friendly, prices are fair, and the food is great."}
{"text":"I go here often for lunch and I am never dissappointed. The service is super fast and very friendly. The food is fresh and delicious. I really love the double pleasure, it is shrimp and scallops in a spicy/sweet sauce. 
Only one thing keeps this place from 5 stars, I would much rather have a cup of soup than the salad. The salad is rather bland and not very good.
The prices are great and have daily specials."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese place! Great for super fast delivery & everything on the menu is delicious! You can order no vegetables if they aren't your thing, and the owner is so sweet it's a pleasure eating inside. The volcano is a fun drink, but they also have an open bar. :)"}
{"text":"Very fast delivery and friendly service.  Food is definitely above average.  Not sure who would give this place a bad review...maybe people who thought they were getting Panda Express.  Best Chinese in the area that I have found."}
{"text":"Always good, friendly, and hot. My family likes this \"Chinese\" best in Sun Prairie. The food is even better of you eat it \"in\". Never full of customers (is that good?), it seems like they do a lot of take-out business. There is delivery. Not much updated decor. Good for when you want local basic Amer/Asian, same menu as all the rest. Some days it's better than others, but never bad."}
{"text":"For offerings in Sun Prairie, this is the best choice that we can find for Chinese.  The quality of food seems to be better than others in the area with a better flavor to all the dishes we have tried.  Worth ordering or eating in from."}
{"text":"I have been looking for a good Chinese restaurant in the area and I finally found one! Panda garden had great food and great customer service. I will be coming back here for sure!"}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was just...bad.  The General Tso's chicken was overly breaded, mushy and barely seasoned.  Mongolian Beef lacked flavor and was a bit of a mess.  Fried rice was too oily and lacked flavor. Brown rice was over cooked."}
{"text":"I was unhappy due to having to wait 55 minutes for my one meal (steamed veggies combo with chicken, shrimp and scallops!  Then I get two pieces of shrimp, three small slices of chicken a few tiny scallops!!  For $12.00 that is a rip off, a joke and unacceptable!  You going to charge for food with those items in you better put more than sliced veggies!!  I will never come back!"}
{"text":"Ordered the young chow fried rice. It was terrible! The rice was gummy and not prepared correctly. Complained and was told because its cantonese style its supposed to be that way. First time and last time ordering from there."}
{"text":"Stumbled on this little place and have to say it was fantastic. Service was great. They were so nice. Ordered the food and it came fast. Hot and fresh.  Not pre made at all. Will be back for sure. The lemon chicken and pork lo mein was great!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has great Chinese food! It's not much for atmosphere but the food and service make up for it. if you're looking for bomb Chinese food in the Ahwatukee area this is your place. family owned and operated. two thumbs up to this place."}
{"text":"Good place, I like that it is locally owned and not some \"franchise\" Food is good, service is good it just needs a little more kick with spices. My GF says they use MSG - I do not think so. That is the only reason it is not 5 star."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in Pittsburgh hands down.  I think Ive tried every Chinese place in Pittsburgh and this is by far the best.  It just seems like everything is a little better here.  The service is great and the restaurant is good.  It is a small local place, but AWESOME!  I am always disappointed when I compare other Chinese places to Panda Garden; they always fall short and I should really stop going anywhere else."}
{"text":"Delivered to my hotel with no fork or chopsticks and one packet of soy sauce. Really??? Not to mention the food was sub par. Generals Tso's chicken was maybe the worst I've had...thick and doughy, with two pieces of broccoli. Steamed dumplings were just ok. Do yourself a favor and order from somewhere else."}
{"text":"Love this place! Always great food! We had the General Tao's Chicken and Happy Family. Both super delish. The Teriyaki Chicken appetizer and Hot & Sour soup was amazing! 
We will definitely choose this place again.. Way Better than House of Mei"}
{"text":"The best-kept secret in Ahwatukee for a great Chinese meal!  The quality and portion for 2 were perfect!  We've enjoyed both dine-in and take out on multiple occasions. Everyone is friendly and the service is fast. 

We'll be regulars at Panda Garden!

{"text":"Consistently had a great experience and great food here. We get takeout and it's always ready quickly. Our typical order includes Kung Pao chicken and Kung Pao vegetable, both of which have been excellent with fresh vegetables."}
{"text":"They did a great job putting together individual lunches for a big holiday family bash we had--14 different selections.  Well labeled, tasty food as if we had been in the restaurant.   We love this for their lunch specials, the Empress Chicken is our favorite thing.  Check out their specials for Chinese New Year.  We had some outstanding food there last year, many courses and it was very reasonable.  The looong string beans were a real standout.  The family is always so friendly and they always remember us, it's just a nice local family-owned and run restaurant, we and love supporting them."}
{"text":"I love this place, service and food is excellent. The lady that works there is exceptionally nice, reminds me of my mom haha! Good times."}
{"text":"First time visit. The place is small and cozy with great service, good food and large portions. The waiter took our order right away and our meals were out within 10 minutes. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Great food for unbelievably low prices; wonderful service, what else can you ask for? Love this place!"}
{"text":"I got take-out for dinner tonight. It's definitely tasty, and on par with most. Also, their spring rolls are huge!"}
{"text":"Wow...
I had to double check the address after reading negative reviews.
The food & service here is consistantly AWESOME!
I didn't want to tell anybody... because I won't enjoy waiting in the future lines."}
{"text":"This is my first ever, negative yelp review and I'll keep it short and not sweet.

I experienced horrible customer service when I went to get lunch with a friend.  I've never had such an unwelcoming experience from any food service establishment.  And their food was meh.  I've definitely had better Chinese food in the valley, such as Little Shanghai, Mekong Plaza, and Szechwan Palace@COFCO.

Heck, even P.F. Chang's is better, and that's not really Chinese...

OK, I'm done.  :)"}
{"text":"BEWARE what you order online as chow mein should have noodles. It seems for Panda only low mein has noodles. With no picture you may not get what you are expecting. 
Poor customer service as I called and was told sorry you ordered the wrong thing. If you Google chow mein all the pictures have noodles, so this must be their version of \"chow mein\". Food is overpriced and poor quality. The boneless ribs were full of grisel. I ended up ordering Pizza Hut for the family instead."}
{"text":"Food was exceptional!!! If you eat in, they give you empty plates, and platers of what you order so be prepared to share, because if you order more than one thing you will need help finishing, which I have never been able to do... unbuvkle that belt boys!!!"}
{"text":"For a first impression, it wasn't everything I expected. We had food delivered, it was late and also had an entire entree missing. Some of the food was amazing (shrimp and chicken wonton, crab puffs) but the rest was super salty and almost to the point of being overcooked."}
{"text":"This place has the absolute best chinese food! I have been going there for many years with my family when I lived in the area.  Now, when I come to visit, we go to Panda Garden for our dinner out.  I've never been disappointed with anything I ordered.  They will even let you customize a dish with different vegetables or how hot you want it.  They have great food, at a great price, and there are always leftovers to enjoy the next night. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Food was excellent egg foo yong was delicious there pepper steak was delicious there egg rolls was delicious very good food and the owner seem very nice I think they was the owners One happy customer will be going back"}
{"text":"The happy family is amazingly good. Also suggest the BBQ slices, and the hot & sour soup. Lost one star however for fried rice/noodles. They have no flavor and nothing in them. I usually just throw it out. Also, I pay for extra meat in the happy family, like $3 for extra beef, and I never seem to get my monies worth, which is kinda disappointing, but it still tastes amazing, so I don't freak out about it."}
{"text":"Ordered egg rolls, steamed dumplings, garlic beef and orange chicken. The egg rolls have a pungent pork taste, overpowered the cabbage and other ingredients. The steamed dumplings were not hot, had an overly think noodle and spicy pork. Tasted low quality. The garlic beef was cold and the meat was very fatty. Extremely low quality chicken on the orange chicken. I only ate one before I almost gagged. Their atmosphere is nice, food presentation and staff were great. Food was just low quality.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Panda Garden is a family run Chinese Food Restaurant that is always friendly, and most importantly, delicious. You can order dishes family style and there's plenty of delicious meals to try. My personal favorite is the Empress Chicken, sweeter then Orange Chicken, but the flavor just melts in your mouth. I just had the Kung Pao Two which is Chicken and Shrimp, and its even better the next day as leftovers thanks to the generous portions. They have a good selection of sake and beer as well. This is my favorite Chinese restaurant and hope everyone else checks it out."}
{"text":"I walked into the restaurant for the first time since I've been living in the area for over 6 years. All my friends told me to stay away from this restaurant but I decided to give it a shot. At 5 PM it was no customer at all. First, the lady, she is probably a cook/ waitress/owner came over and asked what I want to order. Since I've just sat down for 20 seconds, I decided to order hot and sour soup first(how could Chinese restaurant mess up hot and sour soup.) But it turned out that she walked into the kitchen a brought me a soup right the way. At that moment I kind of disappointed because since I came for dinner not for lunch special, they should have made me a soup not just gave me the soup that they had left over from lunch. Oh well, what do I expect from Chinese restaurant. So, I ordered Gang Pang chicken for my main dish since she waited for me to order when she brought out the soup. 

Now, soup was no taste at all!! It was very bland. Even though I added some soy sauce and chilli, it didn't really help at all. For chicken, it was okay. It remained me of orange chicken from Panda Express with some spice. A bowl of rice she gave me wasn't  even warm. 

After she brought me food she's never came back to checked on me to see if I needed anything. I had to asked a gentleman who seem like a owner for my check.

Not so good food, poor quality, bad service. I will probably not coming back."}
{"text":"We drive over 20 minutes to just grab take out... Haven't found a better Chinese restaurant in phoenix! Definitely great food and service!"}
{"text":"This is small restaurant, and short staffed. Great food and always in a timely manner. There's good and bad to this place, but the food keeps us coming back."}
{"text":"We come here for lunch and it's always great. Nice folks and very attentive, big portions and food is good."}
{"text":"I was so excited to order from here, due to the (mostly) positive reviews. Boy, was I disappointed! First of all, we ordered for delivery tonight, on New Year's Eve. Hey, I get it; NYE is a busy holiday for restaurants, so it's not like I expect a 30 minute delivery time. But when an hour and a half passed without our food, we called to check in. They told us, \"Sorry, we only have one delivery driver for more than 30 orders.\" Um... ok? Why, when you know it's a holiday, would you not staff more drivers? So that was ridiculous right off the bat. Then, our food arrived (about an hour and 45 minutes after we ordered), and I would have forgiven the long wait had the food been amazing (or even good!). Sadly, this was not the case. I ordered the children's chicken fried rice for my kids, and I was honestly scared to give it to them when I opened the container and saw the cold, gray, limp chicken lying within the rice. My kids tried it and promptly spit it out. My order (the cashew chicken) was limp and spongy; the only slightly passable thing we ordered was the General Tso's chicken. Although even that, while it had excellent flavor on the breading and sauce, provided way more gristle than I expect to ingest when eating from a restaurant. 

So we may (if all other options are exhausted) give it another try, because hey, maybe it was just a fluke bad experience because of New Year's Eve. But I highly doubt we'll make our way there any time soon. I'd rather just get Chinese takeout from Imperial Garden on the east side of Madison; it's about the same distance from us as Panda Garden, and it's ten times better."}
{"text":"Wow! Yeah I said wow. This was some really good Chinese food. It is payday and my coworkers wanted to go out to lunch. One of them was craving Chinese food. So Yelp to the rescue. We found this place and my coworker realized she used to go here all the time and said it was good. So off we went.
It is close to work so that is good. The prices weren't bad so that is good. Decor was nice a little dark inside but still good. The tables had tablecloths with Chinese Zodiac place mats on them with a sheet of glass or plexiglass covering all of it. Everyone was checking their signs and their families signs and joking around about it. A nice distraction while waiting for our order. Service was great. They had no problem doing multiple checks and the food came out pretty quick. So did the drinks. The wait staff, which I think were the owners, were very attentive. Drinks always refilled and asking us if we worked in the area and where we worked. Also asked us if we had been there before. When we said no they brought us over take out menus.
Now to the food. It was so good. Best Chinese food I have had in awhile. I ordered the Moo Goo Gai Pan. The white sauce that was on it was amazing. The chicken and veggies were perfect and the fried rice was really good. Everybody raved about their different meals. Not one complaint. They got us in and out with plenty of time to get back to work. That was even with 5 people in our group.
I will definitely be back to try everything else on the menu. So far away from that other Panda it isn't even worth mentioning. Even cheaper then them too. Great find. High five coworker."}
{"text":"I never give bad reviews but unfortunately is be lieing if I gave this place a good one. They forgot half the order the lunch special said it came with fried rice and an egg roll and instead came with some weird plain brown sauce rice not fried rice and instead of an egg roll it was a tiny spring roll that was soggy with no flavor very disappointed"}
{"text":"I requested for them to deliver down the road to my hotel but they required a $15.xx minimum. Why would they be added to my hotel delivery list if they would make a fuss about a minimum. I guess I won't be trying them while in town!"}
{"text":"Great family owned place. Cheap lunch and the food is great. Good service. What more can you ask for."}
{"text":"We came in and were allowed to seat purselves.  

We started off with the cream cheese rangoon.  They honestly came out within 5 minutes.  They were fat triangle stuffed to the gills with cream cheese.  So hot 5hat the creamy goodness burned my tongue.  It had a light hint of crap.   I hate when they are more like crab puffs with a little cream.  These were perfect, hot, and crispy.
Chicken Lo-Mein:  The noodles were cooked perfectly.  The water chestnuts were nice and crispy.The chicken was nice and bite-size with a lot of chicken in the dish.  Don't you hate when they use 2 frozen chicken tenders in this dish?  Not here!  Very fresh and a compliment to the brown sauce.  Didn't taste like it was thickened with corn starch.  Will order again.

Chrispy Shrimp w/honey lemon sauce.  The sauce is hit and miss.  My husband and I liked it.  It tasted like a thick sweet lemonaid gravy.  My daughter wished it had a more \"honey\" tadte than a \"lemon taste.  Like I said.....it's a preference thing.  When the dish came out, it looked lile jumbo shrimp.  They were quite small with a lot of fried batter. 25%shrimp/75% batter. Some of the shrimp was hard and some were perfectly cooked.   Katie said its hard to fry shrimp.  Personally, I think if you have a resturant, you should be aware how to cook shrimp so half the shrimp are like crunchberries.

Gang Pang Beef-  This was my favorite dish.  Crispy but tender beef strips.  Delicious sauce, spicy and citrusy.  I would definitely get this again

Great, friemdly service.  I think this will become my new favorite chinese restaurant.  Too bad its 20 miles from home.  Maybe jog here to get rid of calories so I can enjoy even more.  Nice surprise find."}
{"text":"It's your typical Chinese food joint. It's not the best, but better than other take out places. The place is a little run down and need major remodeling, but the food is okay. My husband loves the butterfly shrimp, it's a weird combination but it is good. I typically order spicy garlic shrimp with the mixed veggies."}
{"text":"Great, fast service, and good food makes this the go to chinese when in the area"}
{"text":"The BBQ Pork Slices appetizer . . . check the picture . . . bump the PG up to a solid 4.   It's brilliant.  The best part of BBQ pork fried rice is the BBQ pork . . . so why not 86 the rice and go straight BBQ pork!?!  I can't recommend it enough"}
{"text":"Tonight we ordered from Ubereats Panda Garden and it was very good. 

The kungpao chicken, the chicken is tender and not dry. The flavor is good. Its a 6 out of 10 heat level i would say. 

The chicken chop suey was also good. Very tender. 

The fried rice wasnt bad but wasnt mind blowing.

The cream cheese puffs were great!

Thai tea was delicious as well."}
{"text":"Food is very good. Lots of choices on the menu. Staff is very friendly. Definitely will be going back often."}
{"text":"Very good Asian food.  The ingredients are very fresh and flavorful.  I loved the Shrimp in Lobster Sauce (hard to find anymore) and the Moo Shoo Pork as well as the Hot and Sour Soup.  I try to go there once a week.  Love the Shrimp Fried Rice as well."}
{"text":"The happy platter was excellent and the egg rolls with chicken are the best that I've had in a very long time, they tasted like the ones I had as a child back in Germany!  The sweet and sour chicken was cooked perfectly!  The staff is friendly and we were served quickly.  I'd highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Waited to long for burnt rice nasty food and it was expensive. Never eating there again."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice once for dinner and once for lunch.   I like them because not only do they have good food but it's fairly inexpensive.  I was able to get a lunch special which included a drink and soup plus an entre for $5.95 which is an AWESOME deal!  I will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! And they deliver! They are quick, authentic, and tasty. When I need my \"real\" chinese fix they are my go-to! Their portions are huge... And did I mention they have green tea ice cream?"}
{"text":"Panda Garden - NOT GOOD!....

I have been here several times for lunch, and even dinner. The portions are very small, even the rice is a very small scoop. The main dish, whether it's for lunch or dinner is way too salty, and the food tastes old, the broccoli, was soaked and limp, not fresh and crunchy, so were the other veggies, the meats and seafood tasted limp and old also...
The egg rolls are like something out of munchkin land...SMALL!  very few veggies, and squishy....yew.

Panda Garden:
Too Expensive, Poor Value! = Not Going Back!

Tip: Hot Wok Mr. Cook on Warner Rd. They have the best Chinese in this area and are made to order fresh loaded with veggies and the portions are very generous, and all together cheaper..."}
{"text":"Nice little restaurant. Really good quality chicken. Lots of options for entrees. Will be back again soon."}
{"text":"This place is great little place that my wife took me and she fell in love with there house special gang pang chicken and so now I am in love with it too! Reasonable prices and great service!"}
{"text":"To start, I'll let the facts speak for themselves. 

$1.99 bottles of Heineken 
$1.49 bottles of Bud Light 

ALL DAY, EVERY DAY! Craziness! 
Panda may not have a happy hour, but with prices like that it seems like it would be happy all the time! 

As if that wasn't enough reason to get you there, the food is pretty good. At first I thought maybe they just got all their customers drunk so the food didn't matter . . . luckily, this is not the case. Panda does not use MSG and has brown rice as an option. Include the fact this place is within walking distance from my house and I am even convincing myself more and more that I need to go there more often, not just all of you. 

The few times I have been, there have only been a few other people in the restaurant so the wait staff is ready and waiting to fulfill your every request. The few times we sat at the bar, the bartender has been very friendly, yet knew when to give us our space as well. Seeing as how there are a total of six seats at the bar, that is a good skill to have. The restaurant is a little small and there isn't much to say about the (lack of) atmosphere. All of that is the reason I am a little leery to give four stars, but right now they are at 3.5 ish. 

Advertisement boasts \"We serve Dim Sum! Made to Order.\" I haven't tried it, but now that I know it is an option, I'll have to add that to the to-do list for my next visit."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, food is good, not great but good.
Think maybe we caught them during a busy time that may have impacted the overall experience.
I will be back to try them again."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I use yelp to find new places to eat and Panda Garden blew us away. Great food and service. She had the orange chicken which we both loved and I had the Mongolian beef w/ lo mein. Which was also perfect. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Another \"Customer Service\" challenged restaurant in Bolton who will \"Ask Themselves\" one day \"What went wrong\" when the bank says sorry hand over the keys!!! 
For the record, it's pretty easy! We order the food, pay \"The Chinese Food Luxury Food Rates\" and you cook it!
Yes, you cook the food we ordered!
And if you mess up the order you should fix it! For no cost! And maybe even class it up a bit, and give a \"Credit\" towards a future order- might even make your customer come back???? For the hassle!
The food was a 1 out of 5, they got 4 out of 6 dishes correct, and the food was overpriced, cold and ........are you ready?? Don't act surprised!!!! They didn't even offer us Warm Food...shocking right??? I'd wish you the best but your restaurant has no common sense, people in Bolton will weed you out!
Sad thing is that people will settle for crap Chinese food, just Cuz their hungry!
I'm sorry I'm sure your nice people but get REAL, earn your customer base!
Turn it around, Make me wrong!
I hope you do"}
{"text":"The service here is excellent and the couple that run it are the sweetest but I tried this place and the food was just \"ok\". We had shrimp lo mein with barely any sauce or seasoning, mongolian beef (very tender) but no flavor and shrimp with veggies. The sauces were so thin and about 3-4 tablespoons per carton. I'll have to pass on this one next time. Sorry fellow yelpers :("}
{"text":"I've tried this place twice now since they are close to home, and deliver. The food is edible, but you can expect better flavor elsewhere. I always order General Tso Chicken when indulging in delicious Chinese. Their cheese wontons are excellent though."}
{"text":"Food and service was good, nothing special. If you like Chinese food, I do recommend that you try once."}
{"text":"Panda Garden is the best place to get Chinese food in Sun Prairie. And they deliver which is a plus in my book! I've eaten in the restaurant a couple of times, but usually do take out. I've never had anything I didn't like there (and we've tried a very good array of items). Tonight we had the Garlic Shrimp and Chicken Lo Mein. Both were awesome! The Garlic Shrimp had a nice spicy kick to it, but still had a TON of flavor! The crab Rangoon and pot stickers are also tasty!  Pricing is very reasonable for what you get!"}
{"text":"I've tried and tried to like this place. Really, I have. It's so close to my house, and every time, I think, this time something will give me cause to give it another chance.   And every...single...time... I've been let down.

The first time I went here (about 10 years ago) was because it came extremely highly recommended by two friends and we met up there for lunch.  Maybe it was because I was used to both cheap Chinese food in NYC (which is actually good), and pretty authentic Chinese food from Chinatown in NYC (which is good in a very different way), but I was unimpressed. I think I picked something hard to screw up like sweet and sour chicken and thought, \"ok, it's not bad, but it's nothing better than I'd get from a grease truck on the street or from an all-you-can-eat buffet.\"  Fine. If that was my only experience at the joint, I'd give it 3 stars.

Skip forward about five years later, now I'm married and with a kid.  We got one of those Entertainment books that have all those coupons in it.  We had seen Panda Garden every time we went to pick up a pizza from MM MM Pizza right next door, and since we had a coupon to use at Panda Garden, we thought, hey, let's go there instead of getting our favorite pizza.  Our little kid could maybe eat some dumplings or noodles or something simple.

We ended up getting dumplings.  They were overpriced and greasy.  I don't remember what my wife got, but I got either chicken with cashew nuts or General Tso's chicken. All I know is that it wasn't the sweet and sour chicken.  I don't remember it, which is another reason I can't give it a good review. I thought, \"meh, the food is okay, but again, nothing memorable.\"

But then, the best (worst?) part of this experience was that they wouldn't honor the coupon because it fell on a Sunday.  Sure, it's my fault for not reading the fine print that they don't honor it on the weekends.  But the fact was, I wouldn't pay $20 for a family meal there, based on the quality of the food, and instead it ended up costing me closer to $30.


Skip forward another few months (so still about 2008 or so).  We go back because I still have the coupon.  My wife says, \"Why? we didn't like the food\".  I said, \"you're right, and it's pretty dingy inside, and the person was a jerk about the coupon.  But we still have a coupon so let's go.\" We went and ordered soup this time because the dumplings were lousy.  The soup was bland.  Not bad, per se, not like the swill they force upon you if you get the Prix Fixe meal at PF Chang's, but the soup (it must have been wonton, but it may have been egg drop, but wonton is usually what I would get my child) was nothing special. I only remember the soup because my kid wanted to go home rather than eat it or wait for our meals.

And again, we had to pay around $30 because this time, we ate on Columbus Day which was a holiday for them.  Their manager was a real jerk about it too, 


I have to chuckle every time I go to Mm Mm Pizza these days, because I think of the three strikes I afforded Panda Garden.  It's a shame, because like I said, I could walk to the place.  But even if their food was half price, I'd still go elsewhere.  Fortunately, it was not long after that my family discovered Golden Wok Inn.  While just as dingy on the inside, the people are nicer, the food is more authentic (Hong Kong cuisine to be exact), and the food is significantly better tasting."}
{"text":"Had the Monday special and Bbq slices. The best Chinese food I've had in PHOENIX. I would recommend to everyone. Quite atmosphere and the food was ready really fast shortly after ordering."}
{"text":"Some coworkers were going to Panda Garden and I asked them to bring me back lunch.  I love trying new places.  On a Friday when they went, their lunch special was Empress Chicken where you get rice, Empress chicken, what they call an egg roll and a crab rangoon.  The only thing I liked about this dish was the rice.  I ended up throwing my lunch way.  The chicken were nice sized chunks and they were cooked good but the sauce was just down right awful.  It was too sweet and has a horrible aftertaste.  What they call an egg roll should really be called a spring roll and I don't know if I would call it that?  Like the crab rangoon, there is no filling to it.  Honestly, those should be left off the plate.  I may try another item from here like orange beef which is my favorite but I won't be rushing back any time soon."}
{"text":"Singapore style noodles, steam dumplings and Kung Pao beef with side of fried rice are my top favorite dish there."}
{"text":"Really appreciate the pleasant owner and how he keeps the vibe non-fast food/Panda Express. The food is good. Good prices. 

(Located in Zipps/McDonald's shopping center)"}
{"text":"My wife and I shared the wanton strips, Crab meat Rangoon and their Seafood delight with white rice.  We enjoyed it thoroughly.  Didn't leave with a heavy stomach but with a satisfied one. The Rangoons were a different shape(triangle) than we were used to but seemed to have more filling which we enjoyed. Also the Seafood delight had a light creamy sauce on the dish which accented the shrimp, lobster, crab meat and scallions nicely. We had good service from our waitress. We had water for a drink and it was free and good!"}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite Chinese restaurant close by. However, the last time I ordered there, the food was horrible. I have tried to complain but get ignored. I email the contact to no response. I have called and been hung up on. I will never eat there again."}
{"text":"I ordered the Orange Chicken and it was the best I've ever had! I also ordered the cream cheese puffs and they were good as well. I will definitely be ordering again. I would give it 5 stars but took an hour and fifteen minutes for the food to arrive. But the driver was friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"This place is good but of course not the best I have ever tried nor the cheapest.. extremely high priced. On the inside of this place it's nice and tidy. When I called and placed my order over the phone for take out the person I talked to upped the price of everything by an extra $5-$8 which of course I corrected. The numbers were re-run and sure enough. Smh... but over all it's ok. I have been here 2 times so far.."}
{"text":"We have gotten take out from here tons of time, but this is the first time I have eaten here.  Quite very clean and very fast service. Food is always delicious. They serve quality homemade foods.   Egg drop soup came out hot and fast.  Very light like it should be.  They offer steamed rice or brown rice if you're eating healthy.   Large portions that you can share if you want to without charging you for an extra plate. I really like their teriyaki chicken.  Prices are really reasonable. If you haven't tried this restaurant it's about time you did."}
{"text":"The food is fresh and delicious and the service is great! I always order happy family. The owners are ALWAYS there and so friendly. It's a great neighborhood family dining experience."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with a friend.  Vegetable Deluxe was good but not great.  Service was good until we finished our dinner.  When we continued to talk for about an hour we stopped getting drink refills and were ignored.  I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here but if I was hungry and in the area I wouldn't avoid it."}
{"text":"Every time my boyfriend and I eat here, it has been great. We really enjoy the steamed dumplings and hot and sour soup. The staff is very friendly, too."}
{"text":"2.5* rounded up

Ordered delivery from them through Eat24, and found the prices very high for Chinese take away, while both the quality and portion sizes were lacking. The food was AOk, except for the Happy Platter which was inedibly oil-logged; the delivery was very quick, and the driver was polite. 

So, while I'll probably order elsewhere for future delivery, we might try a dine in lunch, it looks cute from the pics, and they offer specials. The upcharges made our order more than $103 - with tax & tip - but still, that is quite a lot for a takeout joint of American Chinese. My photos are missing a pic of large Hot & Sour soup, which was good, the rest of the items are posted with prices and upcharges."}
{"text":"Have been going here for years, it is a great place for date night, the food is always good and the owners are always friendly and love to talk, its great to have a good Chinese restaurant in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"So....haven't been here in awhile. I usually order for pick up and don't dine in. Today, I brought my kids here for lunch. Each time the little asian lady came to take our drink order, she tended to her phone calls first and also the people that walked through the door. Each time she walked away from us, it took her at least 5 tries to take our drink order. Then we are ready to order our meals and just like before she took three phone calls, two people that came through the door before she came to take our order. I was very annoyed by this and so were my kids. We just about walked out when she finally noticed I was getting annoyed by her putting us on hold to tend to others. She finally put the call on hold to take our order. We love this place, their food is delicious but I don't think I'll dine in again for the horrible service we received."}
{"text":"Very good take out chinese! We ordered a ton of stuff from here for our family and everyone absolutely loved their food. They made sure everything was packaged and held together tightly so it wouldn't fall when a lot of the places I go to don't seem to care as much about that. I will definitely be ordering take out Chinese from here next time."}
{"text":"Panda Garden is now my go-to place for Chinese food.  I was introduced to it a few years ago after my previous favorite (and their competitor) suddenly went downhill.  Each dish I've ordered, usually consisting of chicken, shrimp or beef, has tasted fresh and wonderfully cooked while the sauces are consistently zesty.  The family running the place is always friendly yet they know we're not likely to linger after I've finished my Schezuan chicken and Thai tea."}
{"text":"If you are looking for quality traditional american style Chinese food this should be your local spot. 

Clean and fast you will find every item you know and love, fried rice is even a free option it seemed."}
{"text":"The fortune cookie was delicious!! The best item on the menu! And! IT'S FREE!! Yuuum! 
I'm so glad it was included with our meal... it was the only thing that washed away the lingering burnt cooking oil from the back of my throat and the bitter taste in mouth after having paid a high price for such low quality food. 

Mmm! Highly recommend that cookie though!"}
{"text":"Great food, decent prices and fabulously nice owners. I definitely recommend this family owned restaurant if you're looking for good Chinese food."}
{"text":"It's hard to find a real authentic chinese restaurant, let alone one that delivers. This place is great!! Reminds me of my grandpa's cooking. The prices are fair, for the amount of food that they give you. My order took 45 minutes to get made and delivered but I'm not complaining! This is my new favorite place for chinese food."}
{"text":"They only put the general Tao sauce on the top which means that the second layer of meat doesn't have any sauce, spices nor seasoning at all, which is disappointing but the vegetables are good."}
{"text":"This place is not right around the corner from us so we don't often think about it when we want Chinese. We will from now on! The food is fantastic and the service was incredible. The owners are there overseeing every aspect of the business and it shows. We had the Hunan chicken and I asked they add beef to it as well. No problem. We also had chicken lo mein and egg rolls. Everything was freshly prepared and outstanding. From now on we will drive by a dozen Chinese restaurants that are much closer to us on our way to Panda Garden. We will become regulars!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this restaurant for years.  Never had a problem with staff or food.  Maybe more help needs to be hired.  Owners were running around trying to take orders, refill our drinks (which we had to continuously remind them for a refill) and when our food came out we got cold appetizers.  The lady took our plate of appetizers back and brought back only a few pieces at a time.  Throughout our dinner we seem to be forgotten waiting on silverware, refills, napkins, and the rest of our food.  Never no apology.  Finally we decided to leave, couldn't read our bill.  Asked the man about it and he said we were charged correctly but there was tip already added in total.  Due to the sloppy handwriting I never thought to question the amount.  I always just paid it and still leaving a cash tip at table.  I asked the man how long have they done that ( add tip in total) he says always.  Made me very upset , so for years I've been leaving tip twice??  Plus service sucked! Never got the rest of our order either from appetizers.  Left there upset!  I will not be returning there no more!  And to make things worse a worker there let us know that whatever rice was not eaten it will get put back in with rest of rice in back!  Very very disgusting!!!!!"}
{"text":"For casual and takeout Chinese food, I like Panda Garden for lunch or dinner.  The prices are great, the food is well above average, and the service is lightning quick.  My kids like the soups a lot, and the sesame chicken.  Not the best ambiance (local TV in the background), but you can't have everything."}
{"text":"Automatically gets a 5 star in my book for being the only restaurant that will deliver out in Bristol. Panda Garden is a Sun Prairie staple, I used to go out to eat there with my friends in middle school. Sincerely grateful that they *literally* go the extra mile. Will absolutely continue ordering from Panda Garden and recommend as a reliable, go-to restaurant."}
{"text":"The food is great.  I have no complaints.  I've been here multiple times and tried many things and everything has tasted fantastic.  It doesn't taste like the over processed crap you get at a lot of other places.  As for the service, the wait staff was very attentive.  Regarding the dinning room, it was on the smaller side, but it was clean and got the job done.  This is one of the few great Asian restaurants in the valley.  If you're in the area and feel like eating Asian food this is a great spot."}
{"text":"best place for lunch in that part of town.  They have great food and prices.  The service is great too.  They have my favorite garlic chicken"}
{"text":"Ordered food for delivery using the online portal. Slightly annoying that you have to call the restaurant if you want to use a credit card, but not a huge deal. Online portal provides order confirmation to your email, but no estimate of time. An hour into waiting for our food I called the restaurant. I was told it would be 10 more minutes. Half an hour later, the food arrived. It was hot, yummy, and what we ordered, but an hour and a half to wait for delivery was a lot."}
{"text":"Bad panda! Bad!

Hot & Sour soup was actually so sweet.

Gang Pang chicken was too dry needed sauce.

Teriyaki bowl was sad white chicken swimming in a watered down sweet sauce with limp iceberg lettuce, shredded purple cabbage & carrots (think iceberg bag mix).  

Never again."}
{"text":"Great, consistently good food.  Cant get enough of the hot and sour soup- BEST anywhere.  We eat there 1-3x a week.  Great prices, good quality and quantity of food.  Fans of their food, Lynn and Teresa"}
{"text":"Great Chinese takeout! Finally found our new delivery place near our new home!
Best fried rice around. Perfect crab Rangoon. Potstickers are delicious. The hubs likes their Kung Pao chicken. We've ordered from here four times. It's consistent!!! Seriously so thrilled to have discovered this place after many let downs from other nearby Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"I eat here so much I'm actually embaressed! This place is amazing, I never liked any form of asian food before I ate here, I always order the same thing..sesame chicken with white rice and crab puffs. I like how tiny the restaurant is and the fact that it is family owned. The owners are so sweet, there is never a wait either. They have really good lunch specials and the food is always fresh."}
{"text":"This place is pretty close to the house and I was hoping to find my go-to-Chinese place.  Everyone has to have a go-to-Chinese place for those Tuesday nights when you don't feel like cooking and you just want to pick up your food because you don't feel like putting on anything fancier than sweatpants.  It looks like I didn't find my go-to Chinese place. . . 

Meal:  I have only been here once; I went with the chicken fried rice.

Taste:  Pretty decent taste.  It was actually some of the best fried rice I have had in the valley. 8 out of 10.

Value:  Portion sizes were decent and seemed to be consistent with the price.  The value isn't going to blow away, but its about spot on.  3 out of 5.

Service/Cleanliness:  Service here is incredibly slow.  Really . . . . slooooooooowwwwwwww.  I even noticed a couple of customers were really pissed about how slow the service was.  There were at least 3 or 4 waiters when I was there, but there was maybe 7 tables filled with people.  5 out of 10.

Atmosphere: Typical \"mom and pop\" Chinese restaurant decor.  They have TV's running and it would be nice if they turned them off as they were annoying and distracting.  2 out of 5.

Overall:  There better Thai and Chinese places within a ten minute drive.  I would suggest spending the extra minutes of driving to get something that is special.  18 out of 30 points, 2 out of 5 stars."}
{"text":"Went to lunch with coworkers on a Thursday, it was a last lunch outing for one of our coworkers who is leaving the company and one of my coworkers  suggested we get Chinese food, now still being new to our area we didn't know where to go, so whipped out the Yelp App and searched for Chinese food near here and found Panda Garden, so the place was set and off we went.

We were a party of 5 and we didn't have to wait got seated pretty quickly for being high noon, sat at our tables and looked the menu, I was impressed with the selection they have for their daily lunch specials, and if those didn't interest you, they have a great looking lunch menu too. And the daily lunch specials even run on sat too, thought that was a nice touch as well.

I wish I caught our servers name, I believe she might have been the hostess as well, she was very friendly and very nice, we all told her it was our 1st time there she asked us were we work and just had conversations with us, felt like a nice family place.

I ordered the Gang Pang Chicken lunch combo with Lo Mein Noodles, I wanted to try something I never had before & something that was spicy, and this dish looked like the winner for me. The chicken was lighted battered and covered in this great tasting sauce and it had sliced green onions & fresh jalapenos, and with the lo mien noodles, that dish was delish!!  I just need to remember to ask for more heat next time, but that's because I love things spicy hot!

Happy to found Panda Garden and looking forward to adding them to my fast lunch time eats!"}
{"text":"Been fans for years and order take out on a regular basis.  Is this place under new ownership or management?  Both orders were not prepared correctly and had very wilty broccoli.  Even the spring rolls were different, not sure what the change is but don't like it."}
{"text":"love this place i knew the first owners
was the best food there was 
after the owner change
the food is still great but they charge to much.
when we eat here we order takeout for the whole family
about 8 people 
so the bill gets up there
love the fried rice and the shrimp that is in it 
they have their own twist to Americas favorite orange chicken

{"text":"Perfectly serviceable Chinese food (and I really mean that as a compliment.)
We got delivery from here - it was so fast, we were impressed! The food was hot and tasty, and they got the order right.
I got the vegetable deluxe, which is a lot like a million other restaurants - a basic vegetarian dish. Although here they up their game with a ton of veggies, including squash; and I appreciated that it was not overly salty.
This place will be a great, reliable spot to get (quick) Chinese takeout when we are in the mood!"}
{"text":"The seafood wonton soup is absolutely delicious and the egg rolls are the best"}
{"text":"Great delivery service. Timely, hot and delicious. Vegetable egg rolls were top notch. Egg drop soup was perfect."}
{"text":"My pallet decided it had a huge craving for Sizzling Rice Soup, and Yelp decided Panda Garden was the place for it to be satisfied. Being the lazy person I am (live about 2 miles away from PG), I chose the option to have it delivered. The entire process of ordering it through Yelp and having it at my door was approximately 35 minutes. Not bad considering that is sometimes the length one must wait for food at a dine-in Chinese place.
 
Was it worth the wait? Let's just say my cravings were satisfied. I also ordered the \"very spicy\" Mongolian Beef which was pretty tasty, but unfortunately dousing food in red pepper flakes does not make it spicier. To this day I am still flossing the red pepper flake seeds out of my teeth.

If you are looking for a quick fix of decent American-Chinese food in Tukee, I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best spring rolls you'll ever have.  This great restaurant is a HIDDEN GEM!  Always fresh, quality food that can be customized to order.  I have tried the majority of the menu (minus the seafood dishes b/c I don't eat seafood) and I can honestly say that I have liked all of them.  Some of my personal faves - Chicken w/ green beans, Szechuan chicken, Hunan chicken, General Tzo's, Orange Beef (mmmm), Kung Pao, & Mongolian Beef.  Definitely give this place a try!!"}
{"text":"great place! the food is always good and the staff are so friendly and welcoming. They have great, refreshing iced tea. It's just your basic tea, but it's always good. 
Pretty much any dish you order will be good. A lot of their dishes are loaded with bits of garlic. 
They have great lunch specials and their prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"This is a great family owned Chinese restaurant. The sesame chicken is excellent (if ordered extra crispy). The spring roll is an excellent addition to any meal and they are spot on with the lo mein. They are fast with delivery and carry out; and thief customer service is a bonus!"}
{"text":"This has become my favorite Chinese take-out! All of the soups are delicious, the teriyaki chicken is amazing, and the fried wontons are the best! This is a once a week type of place :)"}
{"text":"A surprising gem in Ahwutukee.  Not sure about the 2 and 3 star reviews but when I've gone there the vegetables were fresh, portion size for dinner were good.  Yes the lunch portions are smaller but it's also cheaper.  We order take-out many times."}
{"text":"Best Lo Mein anywhere in this town! Their dishes always taste fresh and are superbly balanced. We paid them many visits and were never disappointed. They deliver as well."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time last week and I was pleasantly surprised.  Wasn't sure what to expect based on location, but the food was amazing.  The cream cheese puffs were excellent (and even good the next day when I heated up the left-overs).  Had the General Tsao chicken which was excellent and the lo mein.  I've been searching for a good Chinese place since I moved here and I believe I've just found it.  I walked in and placed my order as I wanted to see if they had specials (and they do have lunch specials every day).  Took a take-out menu and can now call in my next order."}
{"text":"Delish. Wonton soup yummy. Fresh veggies
used in all dishes. Donuts were a treat. I will order from them again. Good prices."}
{"text":"I love this place! I feel I cannot say good enough things about this restaurant. This is my fav Chinese restaurant in town and honestly, best Chinese I've tried in years! I love their fried rice and their low mein is to die for! This is the only place I order from!"}
{"text":"I'm not from around here but I'm glad I stopped in here with my family for Chinese food.  I was kinda worried with all the buffets and take outs in the area as I wanted something good.  I was not disappointed.  Really good hot and sour soup and 4 entrees could easily feed 5 to 6 people.  The tea was good as well. The waiters and waitresses were really nice and the resteraunt was clean and comfortable.   When I'm back in the area I will be sure to visit again."}
{"text":"Fast....scrumptious...and great price!! I ordered from here by just picking by name lol...glad I did....from phone convo to delivery it was fast and easy....very poliet staff...i will be ordering again!!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good here! They haven't let me down yet! Love the fact that it's family owned!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the gang pang chicken with steamed rice but only received a container full of battered chicken. I was really looking forward to a jalapeno filled dish that had some zing to it but there wasn't ANYTHING but battered chicken in the container and some sticky flavorless seasoning. Not a single pepper of any shape, size or color :( Was bummed to open the box and find this. The dish wasn't bad but it was a big disappointment based on other reviews and the photos of this particular dish..."}
{"text":"I have been eating here for years and have never had a bad meal... Super friendly staff and you can tell its family owned everyone is always happy to see you come in to dine. I always order the same thing the Gang Pang Chicken (Szechwan hot! Battered chicken with spicy hot peppers and green peppers) Lunch combo comes with an egg roll, fried rice and a crab puff... I really enjoy this meal each time I have it and trust me I have had it a lot I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Great place, came down from Boston ordered take out (delivery to my hotel) I fell in love with the Cream cheese puffs that today I went there to get some more. The best"}
{"text":"This was pretty good service. I accidentally ordered my food for takeout instead of delivery. I called them to see if it was possible to get my food delivered. They were nice enough to change my order to delivery and I just paid the delivery driver the fee."}
{"text":"Had delivery tonight and it came as they expected it to be, the man was very courteous and the food was hot. But it was a little bit greasy and I felt like they were overpriced probably won't use them again but thanks for my Chinese fix"}
{"text":"Good portion size, good flavors, our favorite place for Chinese food."}
{"text":"We always order carry-out, and, being \"creatures of habit\" we tend to order pork/chicken fried rice, beef Low-Mein, and pork egg rolls.
The food is always ready in 15-20 minutes, is always great, and the staff are always friendly and pleasant."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Panda Garden.  This is my favorite Chinese-Inspired restaurant in the valley, the pricy sit-down, dress-up places in Scottsdale and Downtown phoenix notwithstanding.  Every dish I've tried has been delicious, and the service is very fast (normally under 5 minutes for a table of two) and extremely friendly.  If you find yourself fiending for a Chinese fix, and are in the Ahwatukee area, you must stop by Panda Garden!"}
{"text":"Our family stopped in for lunch one day having medium expectations.  We will not go back.  The orange chicken came out cold for my daughter.  Not sure if they just figured \"oh its just a kid\" or what.  The crispy shrimp I ordered was boasting of being lightly battered in a sweet honey sauce with vegetables.  It was everything but that.  The fried batter was just about all there was.  It took some effort to find the shrimp inside.  I am still in search of a great Chinese restaurant in Ahwatukee..."}
{"text":"Ordered lettuce wraps pot stickers amd a chicken dish. Chicken dish was very tasteless. Lettuce wraps were ok and pot stickers were ok. Didn't provide hot mustard or sauce for the pot stickers. Ok for a genetic Chinese food restaurant"}
{"text":"I got the steamed dumplings and the house lo mein and they were both delicious. The place is very clean and the staff is friendly. I really enjoyed their food here."}
{"text":"Super bomb and inexpensive. They're even on UberEats. 

Can't go wrong here and it was prepared and delivered quickly. 

Whatever kind of Chinese food you like, they have it. I recommend the Szechuan Chicken... sooo good!"}
{"text":"This place must've gone in the crapper because I placed an online order recently and went to pick it up. I walk in and two foul-mood women at the front counter are dealing with customer complaints. So, I stand and wait. And wait. One of the woman passes off the angry customer on the phone and proceeds to grab bags and leave. Your shift is over? OK, but how about ACKNOWLEDGING ME?!! Overall, I stood there for over ten minutes straight waiting for one f'ing staff member to at least acknowledge my existence. Not saying they had to immediately hand me my order, but come on! After being ignored, because apparently phone customers are more important than customers standing right in front of you, I walked out. And I'll never be back. Do yourself a favor, avoid this place. They didn't seem to concerned about the customer complaints nor the fact that I walked out without my food (thankfully I chose pay at pickup), so apparently, they really don't give a shit if they get your business or not anymore. So, do the smart thing and don't give them your business. Go somewhere else. Chiang Jiang is decent. And so far, my existence has always been acknowledged there."}
{"text":"Got this for delivery the other night out of sheer laziness.  I agree with a previous poster, as I too got Mongolian Beef and asked for Spicy and it wasn't.  However, it was really tasty and some at-home chili sauce got me on the right track.  The Egg Rolls are huge and crispy.  And my kid finished a whole order of sesame chicken, which he said he loved.  Delivery was fast and well packaged,  so I'll be doing it again."}
{"text":"All we ordered was an appetizer to accompany our homemade ramen soup. The spring rolls were delicious!!!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for years.  It is really good and the price is right!  They will customize anything and you can for the most part get a lot of things in a lunch portion if you don't want a lot of food.  Def my favorite chinese restaurant!"}
{"text":"I love coming here for quick delicious food. Everyone is so friendly and the food is always good. Once you come and try out the food, you'll keep coming back. 

I like ordering the chicken with green beans and gang pang chicken!"}
{"text":"I have ordered here many times and while everything is always OK however everything seems to somewhat tastes the same and lack much flavor. I also always am disappointed by anything with mixed vegetables as they always seem to load up on cut white onion and none of them taste all that fresh."}
{"text":"We have ordered delivery from this place before with no issues in the past .. but I don't know what changed when we ordered food yesterday.. but an hour or so after we finished our food both of us were running to the bathroom.. and my boyfriend still doesn't feel good today.. so let's just stay we will be staying away from this place!!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery 30 minutes before closing. I was concerned food might not be as fresh. My order came and it was absolutely delicious. Hot, fresh-Amazing!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to panda garden since I was around 7 years old. The owners and employees were always friendly and did a good job, there has never been a complaint there. The food is and always has been delicious. There are so many good flavors in their dishes and it is far more authentic than any other Chinese place that I have been to. The best part about Panda Garden is that you can basically add whatever you want to your dish, they are very flexible with their cooking. For example, if you want to have the orange chicken or the gang pang chicken but you don't want it to be breaded and fried, then you can ask them to make it unbreaded! 

Another thing, I've seen complaints in previous posts about the sizes of the egg rolls... this is because there are two different types. The bigger more traditional ones are actually the spring rolls while the egg rolls are smaller. 

In my experience, some of the best dishes at panda garden are: ANY of the Kung Pao dishes, house lo-mein, sesame chicken, Mongolian beef, shrimp fried rice, vegetable deluxe (if you add tofu it's even BETTER), and Hunan Chicken. Everything here is cooked fresh, the vegetables are steamed, they do everything for themselves and they use vegetable oil when they cook, not any peanut oils. Honestly I think that this place is a great find and their food is really delicious. To all of the people who have made bad reviews about it, I strongly encourage you to give them a second chance, there might be something else that you'll like. In my opinion, this place is the best Chinese food place in this area. While the atmosphere may not be the best, the food is delicious and the owners/employees really want to serve you and it is definitely worth it :)

P.S-it's not chow mein it's, lo-mein. This isn't Panda Express kids."}
{"text":"Still great food, I have tried many of the menu items.  My favorite is the \"Triple Delicacy\"; it is basically the Mongolian Beef with chicken and shrimp included.  

I have them add broccoli and carrots to mine.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"Super fast delivery and yummy food! We ordered the orange chicken and general tso' s chicken, both very good. The cream cheese puffs were weird as we are used to crab Rangoon but these were literally just cream cheese.  Still delicious but odd. Delivery was fast...only waited like 20 mins which was awesome! Would order from them again!"}
{"text":"I can honestly say this is the worst Chinese food I have ever eaten or not eaten most of it, spent $86 and the food is garbage, nothing had a taste to it, it all tasted the same, bland.  The rice was awful, greasy and had no taste first and last time they get my money."}
{"text":"The food is always fresh. So far I have had the chicken fried rice, crispy chicken in a honey sauce and moo goo gai pan, and will continue to return to try more dishes! it is never greasy and always comes out hot. the staff is friendly too!"}
{"text":"Just great all around great real Chinese food great people great hospitality this is business done right having moved here in August with my girlfriend and getting ready to move again tomorrow and just finishing my last meal from here a message to the owners bravo thank you so much for everything these past 8 months you guys are awesome and I wish they had a place like this back on the east coast. Never been disappointed with anything from here and never had a bad experiences never had a problem with any modifications delivery included just all around amazing thanks panda garden

{"text":"I ordered from here when I first moved to Phoenix and the food was delicious!! I got the house lo mein and their pot stickers. The delivery wait time wasn't long at all. I will definitely be ordering from them again!"}
{"text":"I always order the General tso's chicken here. The owners are really friendly. It's always the nice Chinese man that takes me order.

The restaurant is hard to find, but it's not one to miss. Give it a try."}
{"text":"The best thing we're the crispy wonton chips

Don't have the energy to get into all the details. Main thing: no real sauce on any dish.

The shrimp/chicken Paradise was tasteless and the asparagus was not cooked at all. Inedible 

Cashew chicken. Ok
No sauce at all. 

General Tsao chicken: not crispy, like soggy orange chicken: but the best of the lot. 
I will not order from here again. Got enough for lunch tomorrow- throwing it away.
Ugh"}
{"text":"I thought panda garden was A-ok. I had the orange chicken and I know that's a boring entree to order but I wanted to compare it to other places I had been to.  Anyways the food was a bit a greasy for my taste but perhaps I will give it another try."}
{"text":"Super friendly service and good clean food. Tried the garlic sauce as recommended by another reviewer and was not disappointed! Vegetables were fresh and portions very generous. Nice to have a good Chinese place in this area."}
{"text":"We came here with my mom for a belated birthday dinner and it was just ok. Average. Eh. Nothing was bad of course, just nothing was great. 

Everyone ordered something different and I almost got a spicy dish but ended up going with a dish that had shrimp, scallops and chicken. I LOVE scallops like no other so that hooked me and this was one of the few that had a picture and it looked great. I ordered it and asked that it be made a little spicy. The food came out quickly, my sweet pea ordered orange chicken and said it was good and then clarified and said it was as good as Trader Joe's orange chicken so take that as you will, my mom ordered a pork dish and she likes everything everywhere so that's never an issue and for my youngest we ordered him chow mein. Mine was good but it wasn't spicy and the scallops weren't at all like they were in the picture but instead were six tiny bay scallops. If I knew that I never would have bothered. We'll we going to a different restaurant next time."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in awhile being we do live in Tucson.  We get up to this area when visiting our son.  So when not hitting the gamut of Mexican restaurants we went to our favorite Chinese restaurant in the Phoenix area.  You can't beat the lunch specials.  Three of ate for $22 bucks.  Best thing is lunch is served daily until 4 PM.  It's a very welcoming place.  The owners are so nice and friendly.  The place is so clean.  It might be the white tablecloths that adorn the tables.  The menu is typically Cantonese with the usual dishes.  Everything is very tasty.  We shared the lo mein, mongolian beef and empress chicken.  The serving sizes are humungous.  So needless the say we had no dinner later."}
{"text":"Ordered ahead by phone, food ready when promised.

Ordered sesame chicken and Hunan beef, and hot and sour soup.

Food was good. Will return."}
{"text":"I ordered orange chicken and my friend ordered general tso's chicken. We could not tell which was which because they essentially looked and smelled the same. Both dishes tasted fried and lacked any real flavors. Even the rice tasted overly wet and tasteless. We also ordered pot stickers which were disgusting, soggy and gross to attempt at ingesting. The meal was over priced for the quality of the ingredients and I will not eat here again."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese food spot in all of Phoenix. Luckily it's close to home and they deliver. I've tried many things on the menu but my favorite is the Mongolian beef with fried rice."}
{"text":"Easy on-line menu, great selection and fabulous food. 

I ordered hot/ sour soup, egg roll and chicken/ broccoli. All of it was great. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. My only complaint would be their egg rolls
We're not good at all and they're kind of pricy. but their chow mein was delicious! Everything else was pretty good. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this business again after a few years. I am seriously disappointed by our dinner tonight. Appetizer Pot Stickers were soggy, under cooked, yet greasy, and flavorless. Shrimp Lo Mien had tiny overlooked shrimp, the noodles were greasy, and overall bad flavor. I General Tsos and Orange Chicken we soggy, full of grease, tasted the same, and unappetizing. I could not even eat it.  If I was in person, I would have sent it back or asked for a refund. Instead, here is my review."}
{"text":"Finally! I great Chinese Restaurant in ahwatukee! Family owned  and operated! I had their Mongolian beef with noodles and my husband had the kung pao chicken with rice! Portions are generous and both orders were excellent! Will be ordering take out again soon!"}
{"text":"Super yum! The best traditional American Chinese food that we have found in the valley. We love this place. They are super friendly and the food is delicious. We haven't ordered a bad dish yet. The triple delicacy, gang pang chicken, mu shu pork and lo mein are some of our favorites, but I am sure that everything is delicious. Our daughter loves their orange chicken (with no spice) and lo mein. We have been a ton of times and we will return a ton more. Yummy!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here with my family and we were reluctant as to what would be awaiting us inside. The place was very clean and the service was great. The food was excellent and the tea was good too. Will definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"I love this place. The fried dumplings are to die for."}
{"text":"I have ordered here before two years ago and I thought it was good, I came back today and ate inside. The soda was pretty flat but didn't want to be a bother so I just  drank it. Then the food came out.. The Kung Pao chicken was ok, it wasn't spicy at all.. but the fried rice was weird. There was no egg, carrot, not even a single pea in it. It looked like brown rice mixed with soy sauce and it was incredibly salty. It was pretty disappointing. 
Maybe they are having an off day, I will come back again and hopefully it will be better."}
{"text":"I ate there 2 times. I recommend sea food soup, spicy salty shrimp, Singapore rice noodle. The location is not that good. It's in Sun Prairie, a suburb area from Madison, WI. I believe if the location is in downtown Madison, it would be one of the top Chinese restaurant in Madison."}
