{"text":"Great modern Italian space with delicious pizza. My in laws are vegan and Spiga always accommodates! Also, love that pesto hummus that comes with the bread!"}
{"text":"We arrived at 6:45, and it is now 8:35. We haven't received our food yet. The service had been pretty lame. Not that many people are even in the restaurant at the moment."}
{"text":"First time at Spiga last night and it was a very pleasant experience. We sat on the patio and enjoyed one of our wonderful evenings at this time of year. The food, wine and service were outstanding. I'm sure that we'll be back to enjoy more of their menu in the future."}
{"text":"Fantastic Happy Hour! Great friendly service. Awesome food! Try the patio Ina Saturday afternoon - bottomless prosecco!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great Italian food with homemade pasta. Nice ambiance with an outdoor patio. Service is good. Have been here four times and looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"First time dining here. Admittedly, we don't do a lot of \"fine dining\" just on special occasions. My husband planned a nice evening out for us (for my birthday) which started with dinner at Spiga. Wine selection was great, complimentary bread and house-made hummus, filtered/chilled water, etc. All the things you'd expect at a nice place like this. The calamari was really good, as was our salad with hand pulled mozzarella. My husband ordered the NY Strip steak which he said was excellent, and I had the Tiger prawns with vegetables which was also very good and flavorful. Overall we expected our fine dining experience to be nice for the location and price, but were actually more than satisfied with what we got. Also, they aren't shy on portion size so that was an added bonus. Sometimes with nice places like this, you enjoy it but wonder where's the rest...not this time around! The decor/ambiance is also very nice - its an unassuming building from the outside and you'd never really know what it was unless you made an effort to check it out or knew where to look. The inside is very nice and its a fairly big place with full view of the kitchen and wine storage room...pretty cool. We sat by a window facing the street, however it is a bit higher up on the land and has pretty large windows facing the south and west...so there was a beautiful sunset we were able to watch as well. This place pays attention to the details in all these things as well as their service.  Our server, Leopold, was really knowledgeable, friendly, and attentive. He even brought out a complimentary dessert for my birthday...not sure how he knew as I never mentioned it but upon making the reservation I think my husband did, and somehow that got to our server. I think that's the most we've ever tipped someone, but he certainly deserved it and really exemplified what it means to be a professional in the service industry. We were both quite impressed.  We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance, good service and food is continuously delicious. I had most of the items on their menu since they have opened last year and my faves are short ribs ravioli, octopus salad, all of their pizzas, grilled calamari, wild roasted mushroom risotto, meatballs over creamy polenta and list goes on and on...coming from LA this has been one of my go to restaurants since I moved here...also great Happy Hour!"}
{"text":"Just had dinner at Spiga ..... First time and certainly not the last time! I had the Beet Ravioli with goat cheese....DELICIOUS and light. The Veal Piccata was fabulous... Very flavorful and tender. My husband had the Rack of Lamb which was enormous and very well prepared. The service was amazing despite the full house... Our waiter was knowledgeable and on top of our order. All in all, a wonderful dining experience."}
{"text":"Dinner was subpar.   I had the halibut special and my fish was very dry. Would not go back except for the drinks which were very good."}
{"text":"What can I say??? Great food, staff/servers, and the wine room has a great selection. Server knew his stuff and brought us an older year of the wine we asked for. (two bottles later), we enjoyed everything. Friendly staff, enough parking and the seafood combo over pasta (Fra diavlo type) dish was almost as good as the Mrs. makes. The Veal shank was also awesome. The bread and appetizers were also good. Nothing bad about Spiga. 10 stars."}
{"text":"Alex and Collin are fantastic! Thanks for great service exceptional food and beautiful atmosphere!! Fernando you've done it again!!!! Congratulations!"}
{"text":"Great new North Scottsdale spot!  The space is beautiful - huge patio, really nicely done.  Service was awesome, food was perfect. Tried the Burrata appetizer.  Simple, fresh and just right.  Bucatini and Ravioli for dinner.  Both were excellent.  Oh, and the Tiramisu was the best I have ever had.  Stuff dreams are made of!   Really great experience and will most definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've never had to write a review before but this was so bad I had to. Ordered delivery of two pastas and tiramisu.  Within an hour of consuming, my husband and I both got stomach aches and was sick.  Called to inform them (hadn't even asked for anything by the way), and the owner tells us it is \"impossible\" it could've been his food.  Considering we hadn't eaten anything since noon and we both got sick at the same time, a more customer-centric response would've been appreciated.  Worst service ever.  Will never spend money here again and will make sure everyone is know is aware."}
{"text":"Third Happy Hour at the bar, we'll be back. Grilled calimari salad features three large tubes on a bed of greens, large enough to stay moist and tender, not your average forgettable squid. Pizza, bruschetta, all good."}
{"text":"Let me first say that the food was very good.  I ordered the steak and it was prepared perfectly and tasted great.  Happy hour was pleasant and priced affordably.  Upon being seating for our dinner reservations,  I noticed that we were to be waited on by the same female bartender who helped us at the bar.  She took our order and we never saw her again until we paid the check.  Service was beyond bad and the noise level in this place was like being at a rock concert.  Do not dine here if you want to have any sort of conversation with your dinner party.  I spoke with the owner and he told me to reflect the bad service in my servers tip.  He took no reponsibility for anything."}
{"text":"Lights out!   Delicious.  Bologna's, seafood Lasagne, pizza at our table-- thumbs up by all. Give it a try.  I will be going back again when in town to try another selection.  Great service."}
{"text":"We are here on a Tuesday night and the place was packed as the evening went on. We were never rushed and I thoroughly enjoyed my dinner.  I had the shrimp with tomatoes and spinach and pasta. Cannot recall the name of the entree. It was fantastic, followed up with hazelnut gelato. Again, fantastic. Will certainly put in in the \"let's go there again\" list."}
{"text":"Grazed off the appetizer menu and added a beet salad. Highly recommend the octopus salad. Great atmosphere and staff!! Make it a night!!"}
{"text":"Very impressed... sat at the bar; Chris the bartender was very knowledgeable, accommodating... said anything we wanted to change is doable... he made us feel \"special\", very customer oriented... great food - homemade, authentic, delish , generous portions... nice music, sunset views...  again, very impressed.... will make this a weekly habit ;)"}
{"text":"Our Book Club meets in the private room monthly and we love it! The staff is always attentive and friendly and food wonderful. Last month, the service was even more exceptional. Our friend had fainted at the table and they were fabulous getting 911 to her, helping the EMTs and keeping all our meals warm until the crisis had been taken care of.  Our friend actually had a stroke and because of their quick actions and the EMTs getting her right to Mayo's Stroke Center she is well on the road to a full recovery. Even more than ever, Spiga remains our Go-To  #1 place! Thank you to everyone at Spiga for the best service ever!"}
{"text":"We stopped in here for a late lunch and loved the food - I had a beet 'ravioli' salad - fresh beets sliced with goat cheese in between the slices topped with spicy micro greens and a vinaigrette. My husband had a caprese panini (a soft bun not tough and chewy) with chicken - the basil and cheese were both fresh and tender as with the warm perfectly cooked chicken.  The standout was the polpo all griglia or grilled octopus with a crusty char and tender texture, which I would get as a main course.  The deserts (we shouldn't have) were house-made tiramisu and the limoncello truffle tartufo (not house-made but Good Lord leave it alone, was my favorite) were both outstanding! The only disappointment was the appetizer bread with some type of spread - both kind of tasteless. But that was fine because we didn't fill up on it. Definitely going again."}
{"text":"We had the most amazing experience for dinner! Awesome service from Reanne and Frank! We were very impressed with the food and service and will definitely be back many more times! We also met them owner who really cares about his restaurant which is hard to find!"}
{"text":"It's been a few months since I've been here. I loved it the first few times but tonight was the worst. I've never seen a place so busy and so understaffed at the same time. Everybody even the owner was extremely overwhelmed. My server was great but he never had much time to talk to me because he had what he told me was a 8 table section. That is crazy!! I told him there is now way you or anyone can keep up with that unless this was a pancake house or something that had a more limited service. Defiantly not a wine service type of restaurant. From what I can see being that I own 3 very busy restaurants in the valley myself is that the owner is more worried about making a profit than providing good service in a place that has so much potential. Anyways I offered the waiter a position at one of my restaurants because I felt bad for him and he was very attentive despite the fact he was more than overwhelmed. I will never be back unless I need to poach some good waiters."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch at Spiga today.  My husband and I split the fig white pizza.  Everything was so fresh, the crust was delicious, and it was really good.  The service was great.  The owner stopped by to chat, adding a very personal touch to this restaurant.  We will definitely be back and recommend it to our friends."}
{"text":"My wife and myself have been to Spiga three times now. First time for  a salad and pizza. I must say the pizza was quite tasty as well as the salad.  We had a pizza with sausage and onion and roasted red peppers. Chewy crust and easy to fold and eat. They use fresh mozzerrella which is a plus.  Second visit was nice as well, with us only having a pizza. But after sending friends there last week and getting a gloom and  doom report of bad service, cold food and not very tasty we decided to go back for another try for ourselves. We chose new years. Why  do people always say do not go out for dinner on that day? In my way of thinking a good restaurant is operating at full capacity every day so why should a date make it different? WELL First of all they did not tell us there was a limited menu. That sucked because they left off many off the foods we were going for. That said we ordered a pasta dish that had no flavor, and the braised brisket over Polenta. The brisket was tasteless and luke warm. The polenta was cold. The pizza we wanted was not on the menu last night either.! I think they have a tough road ahead unless drastic changes are made ASAP, So I would say go at your own risk and order only the pizza!!!"}
{"text":"I sung its praises to our out of town guests and I ended up apologizing for the bad experience. This restaurant has deteriorated since its opening to the point it's now about mediocre food and poor service. We had to find our server to order, ask where is our order, then had to ask for the check given we were consistently ignored by the server.   The food was no better than what you'd get off a buffet line - the chicken parmesan was inedible due to a glob of cheese on tough chicken, the bolognese was a bland block of pasta and meat sauce, and the spaghetti was undercooked. Maybe they can't handle the large crowd given the big venue or they just don't know how."}
{"text":"Great Italian and great spot for date night, group dining or a special occasion. Ask for Leslie - she's the best!! Apps, wine, dinner and dessert was all wonderful. The pollo parmigiana and the IG cocktail were my favorites."}
{"text":"I'm sorry to say but this was one of the worst dining experiences that I have had ever. We had a decent size group of about 10 people so abnormal due to that and hopefully other diners don't experience what we went through.   To start off I had my drink refilled once in a 3 hour time span and that was after attempting to flag down our waiter several times. The service was very slow and the restaurant was busy but no near capacity so I don't have much empathy.   I ordered the New York strip medium and found it closer to medium well but honestly not a big deal if it wasn't for everything else. I will say the steak was lacking severely in seasoning...very bland. The potatoes were amazing so I will give them that.   On to dessert, I got the sorbet. It was decent but nothing to write home about.  On to the reason why I left one star....the check. We waited for about 45 minutes and requested them to bring separate checks. I will admit the one thing we could have done to help ourselves was tell them early on we wanted separate checks for the entire party (5 total due to couples at the table) but I have had medium to large groups countless times and the waiter asks on the front end if we want separate checks.   Anyways, we were told twice they couldn't do separate checks. One couple had to leave and left cash so somehow the waiter took the cash and was supposed to deduct their meal from the tab so we could divvy up the rest since their antiquated system would not allow a division of a check supposedly. Well back came the waiter and AFTER paying over $100 in cash our bill had gone from a little over $300 to $450...fuzzy math right? Long story short on that one he had added the table next to us onto our tab...awesome.  After this latest debacle we asked three times to speak to the manager to clear up the issue, not looking for free stuff or a discount we sincerely just wanted to have the check divided up so we could pay and get the heck out of there.  The first two times with our waiter got us nowhere so we finally asked another waiter to grab the manager which was followed by the manager talking to our waiter for about 15 minutes in our view while we waited to speak to him.  Once the manager arrived he did the impossible! He divided up the checks, we paid...and we left! All together we waited over an hour and thirty minutes to pay a dang check. Unreal. I don't wish ill on the restaurant and hope they see this and use it as a means to improve their customer experience. It looks like most diners here have had better experiences than us but for me I will avoid this place like the plague and go to Sassi just down the road by Troon."}
{"text":"Personally, I've never eaten there but my goodness does it look lovely especially with the congested, tiny, ridiculous parking lot full of cars being driven by people who feel the need to look down upon others who have a car that is worth less than theirs. My blood pressure rises so much in that parking lot, I average about 15 minutes in order to back out of my spot because there are those individuals who just don't know what rearview mirrors are for. Whoever thought that this miniscule parking lot was a good idea should have thought differently. My goodness. Anyways, it smells good, their salads are as fresh as can be, and the staff seems wonderful."}
{"text":"Here's an update from my previous review. Apparently it is the guest's responsibility to confirm things not on the menus description are not in fact in the dish. Also, appreciate him telling me what I can and cannot eat as a vegetarian. This just summarizes again how poorly the owners handle customer dissatisfaction, take no responsibility, blame the customer. Of course it wasn't the fault of the restaurant that their menu was incorrect, and did not mention that there was pork in a non-meat dish. The kicker, he asked that I not dine with them from here on out. You couldn't pay me to eat there again!!!  Received the below message from the owner:  First of all, thank you for taking the time to tell us about your experience and we do apologize that it wasn't everything you would've liked it to be. However, contrary to the details of your review, the owner's wife was very apologetic and did what she needed to do to inform you that you were eating chorizo whether listed on the menu or not. That is at the guest's discretion to confirm with the server everything they're about to consume in their meal. It is also at the guest's discretion to know that branzino is a fish and if you are vegetarian, that dish would not comply with your dietary needs. Having said that, dessert was not sent to the table because nothing that took place during your experience was at the fault of the restaurant; therefore, the meal shouldn't have been comped to begin with.   Here at Spiga Cucina Italiana, we thrive on serving guests who appreciate our restaurant, food and service and who take the time to observe all ingredients of their meal and speak with the server should any questions arise. If that is not something you would like to take place in, we ask that you choose not to dine with us from here on out."}
{"text":"Poor service and planning are an inexcusable combination in a good time restaurant. Thus Spiga should not be considered one as such. In a community with better food and service options available, I would recommend something else. I would be a commend the restaurant review is management and hostess training and management."}
{"text":"First visit to Spiga was for my mother's 93 rd birthday celebration.  We had the calamari appetizer which was excellent because it included the tentacles and rings and not just the fat thick squid served a lot of places.  We also enjoyed the mussels.  Main entrees were a beef ravioli which was stuffed with it and cheese, the pasta with shrimp (tagliatelle gamberi) and tomatoes and the pasta with seafood (risotto tutto mare), which two people had.  One person felt the pasta with seafood lacked flavor, the other thought it was delicious.  I had the beef ravioli (ravioli soraia) which I thought was perfectly cooked, although I don't think it was homemade pasta since it was chewy.  The insalata mercato received rave reviews!  The linguine nero was also excellent with big chunks of calamari, shrimp, mussels, clams and scallops. I would like to go back to try the carpaccio di manzo, which is thin sliced beef with arugula."}
{"text":"Outstanding food plus terrific service makes Spiga a \"must go\" place.  Very nice wine list.  I had the crispy chicken. It was wonderful. Very juicy & favorable.  My wife had one of their pizzas. Also terrific.  AAAA ++++"}
{"text":"Food and Service Outstanding.  This past week was my 4th visit to Spiga.  It's time to give credit!  I have been there for happy hour, dinner and a private dining event..  The food and service was outstanding every time.  I especially like the presence of Fernando, the owner.  He makes a point to always make sure his guests are enjoying their meal at his restaurant.  All the food is fresh and it shows in the taste.  I have had the pollo parmagiana, ravioli de soraia, calamari and polpette.  I am a lover of italian food.  This is definitely a favorite for me.  Glad it has located in my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Love this resturant. Great food,  atmosphere and service. Very impressed... This is my second visit, just keeps getting better..Salvatore is from Sicily, wonderful waiter!!!"}
{"text":"Some of the BEST italian food I've had in awhile! So glad I found this place. The patio is so cozy and the food is out of this world. Great wine selection as well."}
{"text":"We are in town for spring break and Spiga was recommended by a local, it did not disappoint!  We ordered two pasta dishes, spaghetti amore and shrimp tagliatelle, both excellent.  The chicken parm was also terrific.  The sea bass special was mediocre, very bland.  The ceasar salad was great, and caprese salad just so-so.  The restaurant is huge and ambiance and service were awesome!  We will be back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Love coming here often. Very close to home and the food is always great. Usually only have one waiter but tonight we had two and they were awesome. I pretty sure they were working two rooms and it was busy. Always happy to see a busy restaurant run so well."}
{"text":"I want to give this place five stars, I really do, but I can't. I've been in twice, the first time the food and service were great but I watched three different customers walk in with dogs (lap dogs) using the excuse that they were service dogs so Fido could dine with them! To make it worse, there were flies buzzing around me the entire time I was there. But I held off on a review because I really wanted to give this place a second chance.  So I went in again recently and once again the food and service were fantastic, and while I didn't see any dogs this time, I did experience the issue with flies again. Not only was I constantly swatting them away, I also saw numerous flies on the windows and for that reason alone I will not be back. If management can't keep the flies out of the restaurant I can't imagine what's going on in the kitchen. The food might be good but who knows how many flies have landed on it before it made it to my table."}
{"text":"Being from NY it is hard to find authentic Italian food. I stumbled upon this place and it is now a family favorite. The food and service are absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"I don't write many reviews unless a place is exceptional but we were visiting family in Phoenix and all I can say is wow! My daughter in law suggested Spiga and let me tell you, it's by far the best Italian cuisine I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing. From the hostess who greeted us, to the ambiance of the restaurant, all of the Italian places in the DFW area pale in comparison. Our server knew the menu well and was knowledgable in assisting us with our wine and drink selections. My wife had the Chicken Parmesan, which was the best either one of us had ever tasted. At the recommendation of my server, I ordered the steak Sophia and was not disappointed. Our daughter who also lives in the area has wedding plans in the near future, and we plan on using Spiga to host the rehearsal dinner. Try it once and I guarantee you'll return for seconds and thirds."}
{"text":"A lovely place with excellent food. The restaurant is well laid out and the atmosphere is inviting. The staff is well informed, attentive and not over bearing. My branzini was prepared exactly as I like it and was delicious. The owner who also owns a restaurant in Toronto is a nice and friendly chap. I will certainly be back."}
{"text":"This is one of the hidden gems of North Scottsdale/North Phoenix. So glad it is too far for most people to travel - but close to where we live (sometimes we don't want to share!)  The food is top-rate italian  (and we often dine with *real* italians from italy) ... and they don't just have the usual fare - half the dishes are pretty unique, and absolutely delicious (we always find ourselves collaborating to order something different - so each of us can share a little).  While I find many of the dishes spicy (my tolerance is low) - most people I dine with thoroughly enjoy the tastes.  The indoor decor is so pleasant and stylish that it actually starts becoming part of your conversation.  The wait staff is knowledgeable and knows the perfect time to give attention or to give you privacy.  And even though we frequent the restaurant on Friday or Saturday nights during primetime, it's never been too crowded (nor are the tables too close together).  When we want to have a special adults-night out with friends, this is definitely the first place we think of.  So, for you - make a reservation someplace else - so we can have Spiga Cucina all to ourselves!"}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place! Fernando is an amazing owner and friendly guy. The food was fantastic loved the stuffed pork tenderloin and polenta! Get a reservation because they do get busy at times."}
{"text":"Writing this review because we had our company Christmas party Saturday night. A group of 12. The service, staff and food was EXCELLENT. Would highly recommend Spiga to anyone. Will be back!"}
{"text":"This was the best authentic Italian I have ever had - even better than any Italian in New Jersey! Derik  Martinez was a very generous host by making us feel at home and having us try his favorite appetizers each time we visited! The best meatballs I ever had in a restaurant! Second best to my husband's family recipe which is a HUGE compliment! I would eat every meal here! A MUST on the list of places to eat! Delicious food, great people and service In a beautiful atmosphere! All time top 10 places!"}
{"text":"Not really impressed. Happy hour is only offered at the actual bar, which is bogus. I'll never understand why some restaurants do that. We chose the bar area on the outside because the patio was really, really nice (even in July.) I think that was our mistake because we were the only 2 people on the outside. There was a sliding glass door on the other side of the bar that remained closed and the bartender had to open the door and physically come out to check on us. The visits were few and far between, which was a bummer because the female bartender was ultra nice. It was moderately busy inside, but nothing crazy. There was another bartender working with her, but she was the only one who ever came outside to see us, so I don't know if she was getting very much help...  The meatballs were not good. They were semi burnt and kind of falling apart like chopped hamburger meat. The orange butter that came with the bread tasted like absolutely nothing and had the consistency of play-doh... The panna cotta dessert tasted store-bought. Again, very, very nice bartender and very good drinks, but I had an empty drink for about 10 minutes before the bartender came outside and after she dropped off the dessert menu, we didn't see her for another 10-12 minutes.   I really want to try this place again and see if dinner is a little better than happy hour. The pastas looked amazing."}
{"text":"Short rib was tender and tasty. The calamari was light and crispy on a tangy bed of dressed arugula. Service was great, Erica is a sweetheart. We will be back. :)"}
{"text":"7:15 reservation, seated at 8pm, then 2 hours for entrees. Noisy as all get out. Food was decent, when it did arrive. Nice looking place...just not relaxing at all. Sorry We won't be back!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere; friendly service. Food a bit disappointing.  The branzino was over-cooked and dry.  Pasta was al dente but bolognese sauce was bland.  Reasonable wine list.  I will give them one more chance, but no hurry."}
{"text":"Amazing! Outstanding wine list.  Superb service.  We had the mussels and artichokes for apps, the octopus and salad and a pizza for our main.  Every bit was spot on. We were in town for our honeymoon, so likely won't be able to return, but loved every minute of it.  We went because I was craving octopus, my husband was craving pizza.  The octopus was prepared perfectly, not chewy in the least.  My husband had high marks for the pizza, good sauce, crust and seasoning.  Even the basic house salad was extra special with fresh mint and a wide mix of different vegetables.  It was flavorful enough with just salt and pepper.  One of our favorite meals of our trip"}
{"text":"We drive by this place all the time and finally decided to try it. Don't understand all the great reviews. Can't be about the food, must be about the nice bar and patio for happy hour.  For starters, this is definitely not traditional Italian. So it cool and trendy to be eclectic in your creations, but everything we had, repeat everything, was so bland. Starting with the spread that came along with the bread. Great idea, awful execution. Goat cheese in ravioli is just plain gross for those of us that can't stand goat cheese, and especially when the menu doesn't disclose what kind of cheese.  Everyone knows ravioli is made with ricotta, if you want to be different, I guess that's cool but tell your customers what to expect!  The chicken parm tasted like stale breadcrumbs with again no flavor, and was it panko?  I think so. Just not what you'd expect and want if craving good Italian. Lastly, the marinara sauce, the gravy of Italy, was again tasteless.  The only reason why I gave 2 stars instead of zero was that the pizza was pretty good and the servers and the owner were very apologetic and did what they could to make it right for us. Unfortunately, food is most important in ratings and if you get that right, then you don't have to apologize and make up for it. Sorry, but we won't be back. You want real Italian, go to Guiseppe's on Thunderbird/Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying we have been to Spiga several times. That is why I booked the restaurant several weeks in advance (through Open Table) for Valentines Day dinner which also happens to be my husband's birthday. Not even 24 hours in advance I received a call from a hostess confirming my reservation and informing me that there was a fixed $65 menu for the evening. Now I know some restaurants do this on Valentines Day, but they should absolutely have phoned me well in advance to inform me. 24 hrs in advance??!  When I inquired about their lack of notice, her lame excuses were \"well it's on on our website.\"  I did not make a reservation through the website! She then said, \" we've been too busy to call.\"  Really?!?  Too busy?  Major FAIL, Spiga. You will not be seeing us any time soon!"}
{"text":"This is a great dining experience. The food was made from quality ingredients and many of the pastas are made in house. The service was everything you could ask for Salvatore was amazing. Coming back soon!!"}
{"text":"Best fresh Italian restaurant ever! Fantastic food and wonderful service, I would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here a few times.   The Servers are hit and miss. On 12/22/16 we sat at the bar and ordered a pizza.  When it was delivered by the kid from the kitchen he banged the pizza pan into my shoulder before reaching between us and dropped the pizza on the counter without a word and walked away.  Last night the same kid brought our pizza to the bar and dropped the pizza on the counter and walked away.  The dark haired female bartender  never bothered to ask if we would like another glass of wine when our glasses were empty even though she looked at us a couple times from inside.. We finished our pizza with nothing to drink. These two obviously do not like to work with people.  We were nothing but nice to this woman so there was no reason for her attitude except she is selective who she chooses to serve. We have heard this from other people. We will go back when the Blonde bartender is back and only then, she has a much more positive demeanor and likes people. Sadly I do not recall her name."}
{"text":"I went to dinner here yesterday and ordered the \"wild\" mushroom risotto that was $24 dollars. I asked the server what type of wild mushrooms were in it and she said chanterelle and oyster. When I got it, it was the typical crimini and shitake mushrooms. It was good, I didn't complain, but I find over and over restaurants advertise \"wild\" mushrooms and it's rarely the case.  b/f had a pasta dish with seafood that was very good. They make all of their own pasta which is a plus."}
{"text":"Ok - so last time I wrote a review on this wonderful restaurant - we were either there on a really unusual evening and/or they were still going through growing pains!  We have been back to Spiga Cucina now on several occasions and each one has been absolutely wonderful.  Food and service excellent.  Wade as a Server is amazing and Ashley in the Bar makes a \"bar visit\" a lot of fun.    We will be back again and again and I am definitely referring friends and my work guests this wonderful restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent foods and awesome service!! I always felt welcoming this restaurant. The owner always stop by our table and took a time for us. We will go back again!!"}
{"text":"Well, it might be personal preference, although the average rating before we went was 4.5/5, so I think my is rating is fair.  Throughly enjoyed the evening. No recommending a higher priced dish or wine. Waiter recommended what he thought was best. And he was right!  Food was real good, wine list extensive and good, desert as well. All around enjoyable evening. Highly recommend Spiga."}
{"text":"excellent food.  Linguini Nero reminds me of La locanda on Shea from a few years ago.. Acoustics are +/- but service is excellent. Owner is always around making sure everything is ok."}
{"text":"We decided to give this place another chance and I am so glad we did. Dinner and service was great.  We had Meghan wait on us and she was awesome!  My husband had the bolognese was delicious and I ordered the special, chicken linguini, and it was very good.  We will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Loved the outdoor seating and fun happy hour-do sit at the bar for the great view!"}
{"text":"This was about my tenth time to Spiga. It has always been a wonderful experience. This afternoon, however, I couldn't believe how poor the service was--slow--not the waiter's fault. My guess is they were understaffed. We ordered an artichoke appetizer that was inedible, literally so hard I couldn't bite through.  We waited about 30-40 minutes for our entree. My pizza was lukewarm. In all fairness, my partners ravioli were good. When we got the bill it was close to $60, excluding the tip. They didn't take off the artichoke, again, in fairness to them, we didn't ask. We did look for the manager to discuss this with. No one seemed to know anything. Very disappointed. Will give it one more shot."}
{"text":"I have been to Spiga a few times now for dinner and happy hour on the weekend.    My favorites: The burrata is so good and they have a couple options on ordering it.  On the weekends they have bottomless prosecco which is delicious and awesome.  They have a great patio so it's fantastic to just sit outside, drink prosecco, and eat burrata.   The atmosphere is trendy Italian but still laid back and approachable and not overly stuffy.   Like: Approachable & vast wine menu.  The pasta is pretty good but not amazing.  I'm hoping I just haven't found the perfect pasta dish for me yet because I want to love the pasta.    Haven't tried but want to: caprese 3 ways, bruschetta of the day, & the pizza.    I like Spiga a lot and would definitely encourage people to try it.  At dinner it gets busy but is much slower during the day."}
{"text":"Love it! We're only in the area for a week, but we enjoyed Spiga Cucina so much we ate there twice. Very nice wine list, friendly wait staff (Sal was great!) and extensive menu. Everything we tried was excellent. Burrata with prosciutto, beef carpaccio, short ribs, fish special (Barramundi), Saltimbocca Pork Tenderloin, mixed seafood Cioppino, Panna Cotta and the Tiramisu."}
{"text":"Our little secret in North Scottsdale for great italian food. I have not had anything that wasn't delicious here. The meatballs are yummy. I recently bhad the market salad and it was delicious. The pizza is delicious and I also love thier chicken piccata. The restaurant is beautiful and the service is good too. It seems like it's never super busy like some other places  can get up here."}
{"text":"I'm sitting at the bar and service is really bad. Didn't get silverware. Eaten here twice and both times the food was very bland, I didn't have salt or pepper near me. I overpaid for terrible food and service. You will pay because there have a Scottsdale address and the ambiance/atmosphere is kinda nice."}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST restaurant in Scottsdale. From the beautiful ambiance, friendly staff, amazing food to delicious drinks...You cannot go wrong with dining here! There is something on the menu for everyone and the prices are quite reasonable. Fernando, (the owner,) is usually walking the floor checking in with tables and he couldn't be nicer. Stop looking up other restaurants right now and go here...You're crazy not to!"}
{"text":"This is a great little spot that I finally tried after living so close to it for years. I was pleasantly surprised as the ambiance is great as soon as you walk in. The food is great especially since there's no real Italian food in this area. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu but definitely have one of their cocktails with dinner. I've since been back just for a casual drink and appetizer at their bar."}
{"text":"First visit without a reservation and they could not have been more accommodating, especially since it was. Rey busy .The place is beautifully appointed, modern and sleek. A review of the menu showed us a well balanced variety of appetizers, salads, pastas and entrees. Having been to Scottsdale many times over the past 15 years, this is one of the best Italian eateries  we have run across and coming from NYC/NJ , we KNOW good Italian food, The Burratta , prosciutto  app was great, 12 oz Veal chop perfect.Wife had chicken Parmesan and she thought is wonderful. Service was first rate and the manager , after greeting us and finding out it was our first visit treated us to a Tiramsu which was \"perfect\" Spiga is \"special\""}
{"text":"I wish I could do 3.5 stars, but I'm leaning more towards four so we will do 4.   Service was great, ambiance was great.  We ordered the pulpo appetizer, which was very flavorful but slightly tough - could be tenderized just a bit more.  The kid's cheese pizza was not flavorful enough so we had to top it with Parmesan.  We got the braised beef on polenta and it was delicious.  Reason why I am not a solid 4 was because of the cheese pizza and mushroom risotto lacked a little flavor and the risotto was not fully cooked.. Will avoid pizza and that risotto on the next visit.  One of those places that are really cool to go back to with friends."}
{"text":"Food was REALLY good!  It's not far off the 101 and has really great views!  We will definitely be going back soon!  They take reservations too!"}
{"text":"I was not happy with or server who spoke little to no English. The only bright part of service was by Matt who saw are struggle with are service and stepped in to explain our needs. the food was not bad , I would just like to point out if you open a restaurant in this country, especially in our area, make sure the workers speak English! Matt saved this post from being a lot more harsh...."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant a couple of weeks ago and just loved the food. My wife ordered a fish special of the day and I ordered the Ravioli dish w/ goat cheese and short rib meat filling. We were both very satisfied with the meal and looking forward to our next visit. From beginning to end we were well taken care of. The hostess sat us right away, the wait staff attended to us promptly and was very courteous, and we were brought bread right away. While perusing the menu for the first time we had some questions and the waitress did a great job explaining in detail whatever we needed. Yesterday, now a couple of weeks later since our first visit, we decided to go back again. My wife ordered another dish, shrimp w/ linguine, and I ordered yet again the same Ravioli dish as it was so god the last time I went. Yet again we were surprised by the service and quality of the food, along with its great flavors.  We will be back again for sure and next time I will try something different. This place is a must in my opinion. They have a great menu selection, the staff is very friendly, and it is good for all occasions. Spiga Cucina is a winner in Scottsdale and a long awaited quality restaurant that hopefully will be around for a long time to come."}
{"text":"Not much to complain about this place.  Prices are reasonable.  Drinks were good.  Pasta we had was homemade and tasty.  Service was on point.  Place is a 4.5 but will round up.  Love their Negro Pasta with seafood.  Sangria's were delicious also."}
{"text":"Came back to Spiga a few nights ago and sat outside.  Weather was perfect and so was the food.  Had the Spaghetti Amore which was unbelievable! ... The service this time was OK- our server didn't know the food or wine menu AT ALL.  He literally couldn't answer any of our questions.  I'll still come back and enjoy the food and wine, because it's so delicious."}
{"text":"Been to Spiga a few times now, and each time I am reminded of how great this place is. First off, the restaurant is huge. There are plenty of seats and several different \"dining rooms,\" and what looks to be a very nice patio. I've only sat inside, but find the restaurant to be beautiful and the ambiance is very nice. I've been with family and friends, but also feel this spot is great for date night. The service has always been great... the timing of the meals have been appropriate, even when the restaurant has been very busy.  Each time I've dined here, I've been impressed with the food. I've only ordered the pastas, but others in my party have tried their entrees. I've never been disappointed in the meal, especially with the handmade pastas, such a great touch. Desserts and appetizers (try the meatballs) have also been great.  You have to try out this great italian spot, there isn't anything nearly as good in the area, and we've got to keep this one in business! Based on how busy it's been every time I go, I hope Spiga will be around for years to come."}
{"text":"Awesome neighborhood restaurant. Limited gluten free menu, but they did have a GF pasta which I had with some marinara, spinach, and mushrooms. Decor is great; very modern. Their patio was packed; we will definitely try sitting outside next time. I really really hope this place works out. Great location!"}
{"text":"Just ate here again last Sunday, another fine dinning experience! The calamari and mussels make a great appetizer. If you like Cioppino try the Nero Linguine. A variety of seafood over a bed of black pasta with a spicy sauce made of San Marzano tomatoes, thinly sliced garlic etc... that you cant get enough of. My wife and daughter had the scampi dish and it was fantastic. The deserts were excellent also!  Thanks again Derik and Ferdinando for making the experience truly special."}
{"text":"best italian restaurant i ate at since being out here for 12 years and being from south philly its hard to find one thats this good"}
{"text":"My husband had bookmarked Spiga Cucina a while ago, the restaurant is a pretty far drive for us but we decided to go on Saturday night. I had made a reservation for us, but we still had to wait for about 10 or so minutes to be seated. Our waiter came by shortly after & gave us time to browse the menu.  I ordered the Tagliatelle Gambari -- pasta with shrimp, garlic, shallots, tomatoes, & spinach tossed in a white wine-garlic butter sauce. My husband got the Spaghetti Amore -- pasta with chicken & roasted red peppers in a sundried tomato cream sauce.  The Tagliatelle was light and tasty, it was a good summer pasta dish. If I got it again, I'd ask for it to be made without the tomatoes. The Spaghetti was a bit heavier with the cream sauce but also tasty. We had leftovers of both pasta dishes and while I normally leave those for my husband, I actually ate both of these!  Whenever I see creme brûlée on the menu, I can't help but ordering it. This dessert here was darn near perfect! It was light and creamy, super tasty. My husband is a take-it or leave-it kind of person when it comes to dessert but he actually ate half of this creme brûlée!  Overall, if you're looking for an Italian restaurant in the area, I'd recommend checking out Spiga Cucina. I'm not sure when we will make a trek back out that far north, but whenever we do, I already know what I am definitely getting .. the creme brûlée of course!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were in last week.  The food was great!  We had the shrimp appetizers, cheese and meat board and arugula pizza.  They were all very good.  The service is where they loose a star, lots of amateurs servers and staff...pretty typical for AZ.  I would go back for sure as I thought the food was excellent.  If they work on the service it would be outstanding!"}
{"text":"This is the best Italian food I have had in North Scottsdale. I had the calamari and it's was very fresh. I also tried the salmon which was served over vegetable and potatoes. The carrots with this dish were to die for and the potatoes were cooked perfectly. Our waitress also brought us wine \"tastings\" that were basically half a cup of pricey red wine. I left feeling happy, satisfied and a full wallet. With appetizers, two glasses of wine and two meals our whole dinner was only $84. Perfect place for an Italian dinner :)"}
{"text":"How do they do it? Perfect food every...single....time!!!  Last night I discovered a NEW favorite dish: pork loin with prosciutto. I cannot convey to you how delicious this is, you must go and taste it for yourself. Even someone who doesn't eat or like pork (my partner) admitted he liked it. This is the HIGHEST praise & proof I can present to you that this dish is beyond AMAZING in every way!  Normally I don't eat calamari. In fact, I'd say I actually dislike calamari. However last night after everyone at my table tasted my pork loin dish, I was then offered a piece of calamari. I thought I'd just have 1 little piece, but I actually ate 1/2 the platter of calamari! I couldn't stop. It was so delicious and nothing like I've ever tasted before!!!  So the bottom line is this: even if you don't enjoy calamari or pork, if you order it at Spiga Cucina you are going to change your mind and become a big fan. I promise!"}
{"text":"We wanted to like to this place, because it's so convenient for us and we like the ambiance of the place -- big outdoor patio, which is nice. But the food was inconsistent. We loved the caesar salad to start, but my short rib ravioli was really disappointing. The pasta was overcooked and gummy, and the sauce (they called it a jus) was, well, like some brown gravy you'd get out of a jar -- ick! Hubbie's mushroom pasta was better, but not great. One thing they do have going for them is the portions are huge -- important since the place isn't cheap! Net-net is I suppose we'll give them another try, because they're close by and maybe we just caught them on a bad night."}
{"text":"Delicious food, and prompt service.  Very nice decor, and great wine selection.  I like the location.  We went in on a Tuesday night for dinner around 6:30pm, no waiting they sat us right away. Everybody in our group enjoyed their meals. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Eat in- takeout doesn't live up to the quality of product in the restaurant. We ordered the seafood pasta and fettuccini. Just ok."}
{"text":"Never posted my earlier review because I wanted to give another try - went in for dinner with a friend the food was good no problem there but the service is still terrible - the busboy or whatever he is was absolutely rude - we were both shocked at his attitude - think his name was Brandon or Braedon- I guess this is the standard Spiga is setting for their service staff- not interested in making friends with the service staff but they need to be trained in customer service for sure.   Went in for a glass of wine and dinner with a friend. We sat in the not too busy outside patio. The service was terrible and we waited and waited for the server to take our order and she never came back once we got our wine - we asked the busser  to refill our water and send our server to the table and while he filled the water she never came. We finally flagged the server down and asked for our bill - when she brought it she said would you like anything else... I said well we had planned on dinner but you never came back to our table. She just looked at me like a deer in the headlights. This is the second time I have been in and had poor service. One more chance - let's hope the third time is the charm."}
{"text":"Had a great meal here the other night that hit on all positive notes.  The service was top notch, the restaurant itself is great looking and the food was great as well.  Can be slightly tricky finding depending on which side you are coming from but easily visible from Pinnacle Peak, which for me was after I passed it.    The food:  The portions are fantastically large which I sincerely hope they do NOT change.  I had the garlic shrimp app (Gamberi Limone) which had great garlicky flavor but not too overpowering.  Followed by Pappardelle Bolognesse and the Polpette pizza. The Bolognesse was absolutely delicious with plenty of sauce and fresh pasta sheets.  It was savory and I'm kind of drooling just thinking about it.  The pizza was also very tasty with fresh ingredients.    The service:  There wasn't a moment where I felt unattended to or overly invasive.  From start to finish it was about a little over a one hour meal and our server was always there if a coke glass was nearing its end.  Wish I could remember her name because she was stellar.    Overall a great experience and will return."}
{"text":"Went here a couple weeks ago for the first time. The design and layout is just awesome with a huge patio. The four of us all tried something different and there were zero complaints across the board. Deserts were a great finish to the night and we also got to meet the owner on our way out and talked a lot about the concept. Great HH too!"}
{"text":"Such a great experience! Wonderful atmosphere, helpful staff, and great food. Our waiter David was very attentive to our needs and made us feel welcome. Will be visiting this delightful restaurant again."}
{"text":"Had a midweek lunch and the place was empty! My friend and I shared a salad and pasta. Can't remember the salad name, but it had some pepperoni in it an was good. The pasta bolognase (spelling) was very heavy on the meat and way too rich to finish. Our waiter was helpful and friendly. I'll try it again."}
{"text":"Not being full time residents we looked forward to visiting our favorite Italian restaurant but were disappointed.  We made reservations 2 weeks in advance yet ended up in front of the server table, maybe our fault for not asking for a better table, who knows.  Two of us ordered Taglietelle Gamberi which was great our last visit.  Last night is was either over done or old as the pasta was in large clumps and dry.  Staff was very friendly and knowledgeable, hard to overlook the less the average food."}
{"text":"Paperdelle bolognese, pollo parmigiana, spiga salad, and to top it off, tiramisu! All of it was amazing! Sit by the window and watch the sunset. Excellent service as well. 5 stars all around!"}
{"text":"This place isn't bad - been here twice and the food is pretty good, not great.  First visit, I started with the Polpette (meatballs served with polenta) and then pappardelle bolognese.  The meatballs are ok - nothing too special.  I can make better at home using recipe I found on google.  The pappardelle bolognese was pretty good - I enjoyed it.    The second visit, I started with the salmon burrata and again went for the pappardelle.  The burrata was very good, definitely a step in the right direction.  My portion of pappardelle was small this time however.  Not just compared to my first visit, but smaller than other portions of the same dish served to my guests (a couple of us ordered it).    My issue with this place is consistency - they need to be aware of this and try to improve.  It is a restaurant that I would like to frequent but issues like this don't help.  Verdict:  Pretty good - worth a visit if you're in the mood for Italian food.  I will most likely come back."}
{"text":"We went to Spiga to celebrate my birthday on Friday 4/8 and it was a night to remember. From the fantastic and sweet hostess to our excellent server Salvatore; it was simply a wonderfully enjoyable evening with excellent cuisine and service. I had the seafood risotto and my husband had the veal picante. We can't wait to return with friends! The bar area was also large and looked to have a cool vibe and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I live 5 minutes from this restaurant and order the same appetizer on a regular basis.  For take out (at least once a week), I have to order TWO of the same appetizer just to get the same amount of food.  When I called to complain, the owner Fernando said to ask for him next time I was in the restaurant.  Well, I did this past weekend with a party of 16 - and that did not go so well.  First, I asked our not-friendly waiter for a wine recommendation - he claimed they did not have any wine fitting my description (a spicy red).  When I asked for a taste of what he recommended, he just walked away - twice.  The third time, I finally got a taste and did not care for it.  Second, I asked for the owner to stop by.  Fernando came over - and when I introduced myself, he could care less and told my group that the table next to us (comprised of about 12 elderly individuals) complained about our children being loud.  Our children were not even speaking - they each had an iPad and were playing games.  We actually just told our children they should put down the devices and talk to their friends.  Near the end of the meal, we had 4 (yes, 4) of those same elderly individuals come over and compliment us on how well-behaved our children were at dinner.  Obviously, something does not add up. Third, the restaurant served a highly allergic child non-glutten free pasta.  Luckily, his mother caught the mistake before he ate the food.  The boy would have gone to the hospital immediately. My takeaways are: 1) take out portions are MUCH smaller than portions served in the restuarnt at the same price, 2) not a child friendly restaurant, 3) owner doesn't seem to really care and 4) watch your order if you have allergies."}
{"text":"A little expensive but the food, staff and and setting is fabulous. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"This place is GREAT!!!  SO excited for Spiga to open in place of the awful restaurant that was here before. It is gorgeous on the inside. We love the see thru all glass wine cellar.   I got the Risotto Tutto Mare, and it was very good. we got a few appetizers and it was all good.   They had a great wine list, the wine seemed a little pricey, but nothing crazy.   We will definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"This restaurant is beautiful! The wood, glass, and used brick make it feel so warm, yet also seem modern. The patio was wonderful! Great place for a group or just a couple, but just know it can be a bit loud. The food.....not so great, just OK. I ordered the veal. While the sauce was flavorful, (but not enough of it), the veal itself was very tough! Veal is supposed to be TENDER!  Our server came around once that was it. She could have been a lot better..."}
{"text":"Took my wife here and enjoyed the atmosphere and a real Italian waiter. I know great Italian wine and they delivered.  The shrimp were out of this world, my pizza was also tasty.  The deserts were also delicious.  We have already set reservations for 7 for fathers day weekend."}
{"text":"You HAVE to go!  If you like amazing fresh food, impeccable service, and a knockout atmosphere...this is the place to go! Tonight was our second visit in two weeks and it has become our 'must go' place, especially when you want a guaranteed excellent dining experience with friends.    We all started with the light and flavorful caesar salads...the perfect start. Three of us had the tagliatelli gamberi (which also comes in a gluten free penne pasta version!) and I had the wild mushroom risotto. My favorite test when dining out is the amount of chatter and laughter while eating that occurs. Everyone was in the best mood because the food was SO good.   When you go, not if, ask for Adriana! She was so helpful, fun, and cared for us as if we were all long lost friends or family. They have a great wine list and you will not be disappointed!  Thank you Fernando for bringing such an amazing gem to the north side! We are looking forward to being regulars there! Cheers!"}
{"text":"We had the pleasure to take out one of our good friends from Grayhawk for lunch. She really wanted to share this fine restaurant with us as well as some of her favorite dishes. Nice!  Both the inside and outside are decorated beautifully. There is a very nice covered patio outside that seats a large amount of people. It is very inviting with misters on the ceiling fans and tables and chairs that you would normally not see outside.  Inside is very elegant with a bar area that has several high top tables and chairs and another section closer to the open kitchen that has larger tables and some booths. Everything is decorated with a touch of class and a very comfortable vibe.  Ordered the Gamberi Limone for a starter and shared it with each other. The dish has Jumbo Shrimp with crushed Tomatoes, Garlic, Lemon, Shallots, Sherry and Tuscon Butter. It was so freaking tasty that we all wanted to lick the bowl afterwards.  Next we ordered the Fichi Pizza which has Figs, Prosciutto Crudo, Arugula, Parmigiano-Reggiano, Goat Cheese, Saba, & EVOO. It was also very delicious and we were fighting over the last piece.  We than ordered Risotto Funghi which has Wood oven-roasted Wild Mushroom, Parmesan, Pine Nuts, and Porcini Jus. I was surprised on how fast it came out and thought it was a little thicker and heavier than what we'd had in the past. It was still very good but very rich. Maybe I'm just not used to eating that kind of dish and thought it would be different.   This is a very nice restaurant and we all thoroughly enjoyed our visit. Definitely would recommend coming here and trying out their food. It may not be exactly what they eat in Italy and more of a Mediterranean version with a twist. Either way everything was very fresh and the service was friendly and most helpful. MAMA MIA!  4.25 STARS"}
{"text":"I had lunch at Spiga a handful of times and every time it's just as authentic, delightful, comfortable, filling, and delicious as the time before. The owners are so kind and welcoming whether they know you by name or it's your first visit. Really great group of people and top quality food - from prep to presentation! Looking forward to cooler weather so we can sit on the patio next time I visit!"}
{"text":"Lovely experience!  Met a couple girlfriends for dinner over the weekend and we had a great experience.  Service was great and our server brought a tiny little coat rack for our purses.    My cocktail was delightful and the roasted garlic dip they bring with sourdough was delicious.  My mushroom risotto was fantastic.  Super creamy risotto with intense mushroom flavor accented with pine nuts and Parmesan - it was still delicious the next day.     For dessert, we shared dulce de leche cheesecake and tartufo.    The entire experience reminded me of dining in Europe.  We were there almost three hours and not even a little bit rushed.    The only drawback is that the acoustics make it quite noisy which made the meal a bit less relaxing than it could have been."}
{"text":"BEST Italian food. Spiga is my go to any occasion. Friends, family, a date; it's perfect. I personally love their pizza but I've heard nothing but amazing things about their pasta. Every time I go I try a new appetizer and I trust the waiter to pick my cocktail. Love the staff and the food. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Tonight was the second time eating at this restaurant. Our first visit, was when it first opened. The service was terrible, but we chalked it up to,its new...my parents wedding anniversary was this weekend.they heard about spiga, read the menu online and really wanted to go so we chose to take them here. I made the reservation for four and I let the hostess know it was my parents anniversary. Most restaurants at this price point, actually any price point would've brought out a dessert that said happy anniversary. But before all that, let's just say we didn't even know what our waiter looked like.we ordered the 2 grilled octopus, calamari, some sort of shrimp appetizer,salads, veal Parmesan, spaghetti Amore, chicken piccata and Bucatini. Cappuccinos and two desserts. So As you can see, we drop some money on this dinner that we wanted to be special for our parents. We did a lot of waiting around. The spaghetti Amore was delicious.the grill octopus was delicious. The salad  were delicious and the chicken piccata was delicious. The veal Parmesan was not. My husband said it was not crispy and it wasn't seasoned well. When it came to the celebration of the anniversary, I was hoping for a little attention from the staff for my parents. The food was good but not good enough to deal with the lack of attention. I don't know if they're just short staff? Or what? Sad they cant get The service part down, because the food mostly is good."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, service and atmosphere.  They have a great selection of pastas, pizzas and other entrees and the food is reasonably priced for Scottsdale.  Nice bar seating as well."}
{"text":"I was fortunate enough to utilize Spiga to cater a small work event.  I could not have been happier!  Derik was so accommodating and so polite.  He made substitutions as necessary, and when I asked him to work within a specific dollar amount per person, we were still able to taste a number of things from the menu.  And the taste was magnificent!  My colleagues were so happy and so impressed!  I would DEFINITELY consider Spiga again for a future event!"}
{"text":"I have to agree with the other great reviews!  This place is fantastic!  Our group (5 people) ate here on Tuesday July 7 and though it was a Tuesday it was very busy.  They have a great happy hour wine selection and appetizers.  We all had different dishes and they were all awesome.  If you ate here before when it was Xtapa Joe's you have to go back.  The new owners really updated the decor inside and opened up the kitchen.  The atmosphere was great and our waitress Erica was so attentative."}
{"text":"Delicious! Everything we ordered was great and we received excellent service. The previous reviews I read were correct - it does get loud - but I didn't really mind."}
{"text":"I went to lunch with 2 others and we shared everything. The beef ravioli was excellent with very tender pasta and a hearty mushroom sauce. The shrimp and pasta also worthy. The chicken paillard panini was not so good. Bread does not hold up the sandwich and the chicken was too thin and dry. Not very tasty. None of us cared for the bread in the bread basket or panini-all of us being Italians prefer something more along the lines of a sourdough. Service was very good but there were only 4 tables the 2 hours we were there. Patio looks great but too hot for us on this day. Would come back for the pasta dishes but not the sandwiches. It is a big open dining area so expect it to be noisy and no privacy."}
{"text":"Phenomenal. I've had almost everything on the menu and it is great. the drive takes me about 35-40 min but 100% worth it. The wine list is amazing and the pairing quality of the wine to food is 5 out of 5. I can't pick out one specific thing to eat because I've just had so much on the menu that you can't go wrong.  Night vibe is so fun and loud. Love it!"}
{"text":"We visited Spiga Cucina in North Scottsdale today, and were pleasantly surpised.  Like 99.99 percent of all American restaurants on Mother's Day (other than Burger King or In 'N Out), the lunch menu was unavailable--only brunch or dinner.  However despite that drawback, each of us was able to find a very tasty dish.  My bride got an item off the brunch menu--salmon carpaccio on a bagel with cream cheese, arugula, red onion and capers.  It was wonderful, generously portioned and a steal for only $10.  She gave me a taste, and I concurred fully with her assessment.  I ordered a slightly more expensive item off the dinner menu, Spaghetti Amore, for $16.  It came with lots of fresh grilled chicken (not overdone, by the way) in a red pepper cream sauce.  The portion was quite large, and I could barely polish it off.  There may have been great desserts, but we were both too stuffed to try them.  All the items were generously portioned as far as I could tell.  The pizzas were $12-$16 and the ones I saw being delivered appeared to be twice the circumference of an Olympic discus.  My spouse had a limoncello drink with tequila, while I opted for my standard iced tea with extra, extra lemon.  Once again, these were both excellent.  Like General MacArthur in WWII, we will return!"}
{"text":"Short rib ravioli was phenomenal!   Great wine & good service.   Have been here several times and always consistent!"}
{"text":"2/5/16. Another great visit. Fantastic service and food. Our server Jeff was great and very knowledgeable and helpful.     Once again we highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Always excellent. Fernando and staff do a great job. Good food at a fair price. Just what my wife and I needed this evening. Thanks again Fernando."}
{"text":"We LOVE this place!  Location is amazing in the evening-- go watch sunset!!! Patio is simply gorgeous with fabrics chosen and flower bed surrounded it. Really chic   Inside is just as lovely. A giant glass wine room is in middle of restaurant. Ladies restroom is stocked! Hairspray lotion and such. I love that part.  Cocktails are best!!!!! Come icy, well mixed and perfect! Owner and wait staff always seem to remember us. That's so kind. I hadn't gone for a while once and when I was trying to figure which cab wine I liked, pondering out loud, the waiter kindly patiently reminded me of the one I ordered last time! And even offered to bring a sample anyway.  We love the pasta dishes. Perfect sauce and cooking. my husband ordering their bolagnese every time, which never disappoints. Generous portions. I have ordered the steak at times which was excellent in cooking presentation and sauce. I would urge you to give their roast chicken and potato a try. Seems simple but it is so much more.   Many of the appetizers are amazing- cheese and charcuterie olive platter is gorgeously displayed and super good. Their bread set before dinner is way to hard to resist.  Every desert I have eaten was great. Well presented and consistent excellent flavor. My only thing I won't order after trying a few times is panini sandwiches. I kept forgetting how they make it. Top bread is grilled as I think they put it on chargrill instead of in the panini press. Resulting in flavorless over toasted bread with no melty ingredients inside. I have Ordered it several times. It's needs revisiting. A knockout melty mozzarella tomato basil panini is lacking in the valley.  All else here doesn't disappoint with just the ambience enough for a cocktail visit. I suggest getting there early- grabbing your strategic corner patio spot, sip your ice cold cocktail and have your dinner mates be absolutely amazed by the incredible sunset before you as you stuff yourself with bread pasta and dessert"}
{"text":"Outstanding vibe, great food and wonderful service. Never thought a place would survive in that location, but we have a winner!"}
{"text":"We gave them another try this week. The same waiter that we had the first time waited on us again so the bar was unmoved. This visit he was very attentive and courteous.  We ordered a Spiga salad split, prosciutto wrapped pork tenderloin and seafood risotto. The salad was fresh and the split still gave us two good sized portions. It was a good choice.  The prosciutto wrapped tenderloin was a tasty, massive portion served with mashed potatoes and veggies. It was in one word...... Wonderful. The seafood risotto was a good sized portion of tender rice served with plenty of clams, mussels, shrimp, squid and one scallop and a baby octopus. I will definitely order this dish again.  All and all I'm glad we came back for a second try and I'm even happier that our first poor experience was an isolated incident."}
{"text":"First time to eat here since they opened was last night.  We got here kind of late on a Thursday night around 8:30.   I was surprised by how many people were there eating, it was pretty busy.  Service was prompt and friendly.  The food was delicious, fresh and a lot of choices.  From the salads, pasta, main entree to dessert everything was very tasty.  We will enjoy this restaurant again.  So glad it is in our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Spiga Cucina Italiana is by far the best Italian restaurant in these parts. Fine dining at its best... A lot of thought went into the design of the place. Full of character; a mixture of the finest materials (wood, slate, wrought iron, glass, etc.) puts you in awe as you take in its beauty.  We sat on the patio...along with many others. And what a patio it is! Very spacious, calm; nice ambience for a Thursday evening. Our waitress was very attentive and knowledgeable of the offerings. Fernando, the owner, stopped by the table for a short chat. He later gave us a grand tour of the place and share the background is its origin.   Let's get to the eating... The Spiga salad, for starters, contains a combination of ingredients that I haven't tried before...mixed greens, capers, prosciutto, pistachios, pepperoncini, tomatoes, peppers, salami (I'm sure I'm forgetting something) tossed in a champagne vinaigrette dressing. (yum!)  I chose the Filetto di Maiale as my entree. It's a pork tenderloin wrapped in prosciutto and placed smack dab on a bed of the most delicious mashed potatoes; served with seasoned veggies (broccoli, red peppers, etc.) Mister had Gamberoni Alla Griglia...four or five of the biggest prawns I'd ever seen. Grilled! (eeer, yes; I want a bite!) Delicious! Speaking of sharing. The servings are huge! Go there hungry! For dessert, we were too stuffed for anything other than gelato...vanilla.   This is as good of eating as it get y'all! The presentation of and taste of the food was phenomenal...cooked to perfection! The warm vibe,  esthetics of the place added to the experience."}
{"text":"Very very noisy. Not a place to go for a romantic evening     Our table was right by where everyone walked by...... not great. I felt that the tables were crammed in   I had the veal which was pretty tasty. Just the right amount of lemon.   The dessert tiramisu was heavy ..... next time I would choose the pan a cotta"}
{"text":"Sorry, I was very disappointed with my experience here. The restaurant is very busy with an open floor plan. It was so noisy I could not hear the person I was with.  The waiter did not mention the specials for the night. He said he would be back with bread but never brought it. The quality of the food was good but I would not go back based in service and noise level."}
{"text":"Ladies and gent grab your reservations. This place, in season, is like Grand Central Station. It's a production madhouse that is magically somehow orderly. There are multiple dining areas. Our friends reserved the Patio that has more ambiance than the other rooms--which are also much louder. Stacks of wine bottles line up and down ceiling racks.  People flow to and from all corners of this place. This Italian restaurant owned by a very attentive x-Canadian (who circulates to tables) is worthy of some applause given the challenge of directing so many people.  We order the three-way Caprese Salad, which is an excellent choice. The tomatoes were flavorful and the assortment of fresh mozzarella brag-worthy. We also order the soup of the day; a delicious mushroom bisque. For my entry, I shared the two-way seafood platter. We had asked for it divided but when it came to the table told, \"The Chef prefers the presentation on a single platter.\" The assortment includes a small lobster tail, calamari, scallops, and scampi with vegetables. It was flavorful except swimming in too much butter; especially my vegetables that were drenched. My husband's steak, while flavorful, was over cooked. The challenge is likely managing such a huge production and getting all the orders right. The food is probably at its best if you try this place off season or not on an overly crowded weekend night. But I will return again for sure!"}
{"text":"I thought the food was amazing! Really nice ambiance and service was awesome! Fresh food and really good drinks!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a beautiful restaurant, terrific food and outstanding service, this is the place. We had never been to Spiga's before, but it is now on the top of our list for both a casual night out, or a formal dinner!"}
{"text":"Finally we have a nice modern italian restaurant in our neighborhood, yes, I would call it \"modern\" Italian because they don't offer your typical staples from the east coast.  There are several of those places around and if you want that then this is not your place.  The first time I came to this restaurant they had just opened, and there were a couple of hiccups, but I don't blame them, since this happens everywhere and they were more that happy to accommodate my twins, even though I usually don't bring my kids to restaurants that are this nice, I am always concerned about other people at a nice restaurant having a good experience, but that is just me (my kids are not horrible, they are just kids).  They made us a cheese pizza for them to our specifications, I had the pappardelle and my husband had the salciccia pizza.  My pappardelle were a little under done,  Our second experience, was a whole different picture, this time the restaurant was packed, I was happy to see that.  The level of noise is high, specially in the bar area, but not impossible to hear, unless you need a hearing aid I guess.  It had a very energetic vibe.  It seems that their busy time starts at 6:30p.m. and goes to 8:30pm on Saturdays.  We were lucky to find a high top at the bar around 6:40p.m.  By the time we left at 8:00, there were several people at the entrance waiting for tables. The cocktails look delicious,  I had a glass of red wine again, but I will try a cocktail next time. We started with the carpaccio and it was delicious, the beef was thinly sliced and it came with arugula and shaved parmesan.  My husband had another pizza and I decided to give the pappardelle another try, this time I specified to let them cook a little longer.  They came perfectly cooked, and it was delicious.  We ended our meal with Torta de la Nonna, a delicious cake, and coffee.  Service during this time will be a little slower, so if you are in a hurry, come at another time.  If you are vegetarian, go to a vegetarian place, I don't go to a vegetarian place and ripped them a new one, because as an omnivore I think their food taste like paste."}
{"text":"This is my Wife and my favorite Italian Restaurant for sure. Whether you enjoy them for Happy Hour or for a full meal experience, you will not be disappointed. From the time you walk in the door and are greeted by the host or hostess you feel welcomed. The inviting decor is urban yet classy.  Frernando is the owner along with his wife Paula and they are they go out of their way to make you feel like family.   We have enjoyed some great handcrafted cocktails,wines, Pizza, Meatballs,  House made Pastas, Beef, Chicken and Seafood dishes along with some mouth watering desserts and all were EXCELLENT.  Very energetic atmosphere and is not the place to go if you want to be intimate with your partner.  if you want to have some great food and drinks and feel like you are sitting down to a meal with your family, this is the place to be.   Reminds me of dinner at Noni's House."}
{"text":"My wife and I went with my parents to Spiga Cucina Italiana for dinner. Parents were visiting (for a month) and wanted to take us out. I searched for a good meal at a reasonable price. We hadn't been to Spiga before, and it turned out to be a great choice! We had linguini nero (dad), tagliatelle gamberi (wife & mom) and filetto di maiale \"saltimbocca\" (me). The waiter was very knowledgeable and helpful in selecting our dinners and our wines (by the glass). I loved my saltimbocca. They were generous with the proscuitto, and the carmalized onions and veggies and sage pan jus were terrific. My dad hadn't had ink pasta before, and seemed a bit skeptical at first, then leaned into it an loved it. A touch spicy, which he likes. The gals both enjoyed their tagliatelle gamberi, that had a good amount of shrimp, and nice gentle balance of flavors.  We took home some of the tagliatelle gamberi. Nothing remained of dad's pasta or my pork. My only issue was the prosciutto burrata (appetizer) came moments before the entree, crowding things up a bit. However, it was good eating the burrata and dinner together.  Oh. Loved the wine, too. Lots of choices, so the waiter's guidance was very helpful."}
{"text":"I love the octopus appetizer. Literally is life changing. It's a cute place, I always grab a dirty martini and sit on the patio. The pasta dishes are what i recommend. They're filling and have really good quality"}
{"text":"This is possibly our new favorite. I feel like we say that a lot but this is like Sassi but slightly less expensive and the food is pretty comparable. Sassi has the advantage of the amazing grounds but we love the light airy feel of Spiga. I went once for lunch and now my husband and went for dinner together. The octopus appetizer is amazing. I had the monk fish special for dinner. Seriously delightful! The amatricana was fabulosity. I also has the beet ravioli previously and it was surprising, different and refreshing. The drinks are good. Though this time some things were missing from my cocktail. The wine list is spectacular with DOC and other designations for the Italian wines. We have already told friends to go there. Oh and the tartufo dessert is a can't miss."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Phoenix!  Great food, friendly staff, very warm and inviting!   Loved the energy and of course the food!   It's a family owned restaurant and you can tell the owners are very much involved and engaged with the staff and customers!  Just loved the whole dining experience!   I cannot wait to go back with friends and family!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this restaurant more than 5 stars. This place hits on all 8 cylinders. I am an operations manager at a local restaurant chain in Phoenix called biscuits cafe.   I was blown away by everything in this restaurant. We were seated immediately. Greeted by our server promptly. Rodrigo, he was phenomenal. I went through 6 glasses of water and he always had it refilled. He honored a special request I had because I wanted to try to separate items. He was very polite. Before our meal arrived the owner came to our Table, introduced himself, and even shook my hand. Fernando was a very personable man and you can tell is very passionate about his restaurant.   Now the food. I don't even know how to describe how good it was. But I know I have left overs and I'm beyond excited. I almost NEVER eat my left overs but I know I will eat these. I can't wait to come back.  This place is 100%"}
{"text":"I typically avoid Italian food, but Spiga is the exception.  The meatballs chicken parmesan was perfectly savory without the food coma side effect."}
{"text":"Found this restaurant online while researching restaurants. We dined for lunch with friends and agreed the food was superb. The beet ravioli was very good and the pasta exceptional. Great atmosphere. The bread could have been warm rather than straight out of the refrigerator. Same for the butter. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times and the food and service is always spot on. Some of the food is over priced like the $10 cheesecakes but we got them anyway and they were delicious. Other than some high prices it's still 5 stars every time we go. FYI the Lavanda drink is incredible and a perfect summer drink"}
{"text":"First off, I am so happy there is a nice modern restaurant with a happy hour and beautiful views in our area. When we first walked in and asked to sit in the happy hour section we were hesitant because it was all high tops in the bar area. We had our son with us who needs a high chair so sitting in the bar would not work with us. Then out of the corner, the manager comes over and says to us that it's not a problem for us to sit in the dining room for HH since had a little one in tow! That set things off on the right foot for us. They didn't have a kids menu, however our waiter who was so polite and helpful told us he can make a kids pizza. We also ordered a salad and several things off the menu. The meatballs and salmon bruschetta were outstanding. The HH wine was so darn good, we wondered how they can serve it for $5 or $6 a glass. This new restaurant rated high in my book. In my opinion, I think it's perfect for a date night or even a group of friends. The ambience is what made the place feel warm and inviting, however the food is what will keep us going back."}
{"text":"We have dined at this restaurant on multiple occasions  and each time it's better than the last . Derek  The restaurant manager is a wonderful host and always makes you feel at home and special .  The ambience is comfortable the food is delicious  the service is attentive  and the prices are fair .  Having lived most of my life in Manhattan and  in Los Angeles I know good restaurants and good service  and this is one of the best .  If you're in the Scottsdale area I highly recommend you give this restaurant a chance you will not regret it ."}
{"text":"The menu selection was vast, listing tantalizing dishes to appease everyone from the casual Italian diner, to someone adventurous who indulges in pulpo (octopus) or linguini nero (squid ink pasta). But despite the glitz of the menu, the food itself was underwhelming. The grilled octopus appetizer had a great char and looked beautiful, but the taste was far from recognizable. All I could taste was salt, with a brief reprieve from the micro greens. The pasta main course was no different. The house made pasta was OK. But once again, overly salted.  Tragically, Spiga has the potential to be so much better.  The ingenuity of the menu and the ingredient pairings can be a solid win. But whoever is in the kitchen needs to have more restraint on the seasoning.  Until they get a deft hand in the kitchen, I'll say pass."}
{"text":"Spiga Cucina is by far our favorite Italian restaurant. First, the ambience is amazing. The decor is beautiful, the lighting perfect & you feel like you're in a 5 Star restaurant.  The service is impeccable. No rush here, take your time, relax & stay a while. Now...the food!! OMG! Everything you order is over the top. And we've traveled the states & Italy.  The artichoke appetizer!! Salads... you can't go wrong & any entree! Tonight we had the Sea Bass special & Seafood Risotto. Both were amazing.. Fernando, the owner makes his way around & gives a kind hello, asking how things are, etc. That is the perfect touch to a perfect evening. Do Not miss this restaurant. Once you've been here, you will always be back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic food, ambiance and service.  The grilled octopus appetizer was a surprise on on good it was and the veal piccata was the best I ever had. The outdoor seating was a fun experience.  Definitely coming back.  It's a good idea to make a reservation because it's a happening place.  Pricing was decent compared to restaurants closer to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Second visit in a year. The food is solid, good Italian. However, if you are looking for a romantic dinner engagement, forget it. The noise level was deafening. I needed a megaphone to talk to each other. It was a \"Chuckie Cheese\" moment. LOUD and more loud. For $50 per person, I can find better and quieter places to visit. Go alone, so you don't have to attempt conversation. Wait staff was attentive but totally stressed out. Bottom line: Good food, and a take home headache! Take two aspirins and call me in the morning:{"}
{"text":"My first visit I got the veel ravioli and it was absolutely amazing then my second visit I got this seafood platter for 2 and it was the best seafood I've had in a long time. Reminds me of all the good seafood I use to get in Florida. I will definitely be returning to this place many more times in the future"}
{"text":"There is nothing I can say that hasn't already been said.  Great food, great service, and great atmosphere.  Top notch Italian cuisine at reasonable prices.  The portions were surprisingly large when compared to other \"fancy\" Italian joints in town.  I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Haven't been to Spiga in a long time and now I remember why. The place sucks. The food is mediocre, the service is terrible, the noise is insane. How do they stay in business? WONT EVER GO BACK."}
{"text":"Ahhh Spiga, one of the first places Dan I went to when we started dating.   Visited Spiga a week or so ago and the food was amazing!  We started with the calamari, perfectly cooked. For our entrees we ordered the salmon (trancia di salmone) which was to die for, the flavors of the sesame crust was incredible. We also ordered the  pork loin dinner special which was OUT OF THIS WORLD!!   Ahhh, the wine, let's talk about the wine! We ordered a bottle of wine, don't just go for a glass of wine, order a bottle! Their selection is one of the best we have come across in the valley, if you're looking for a particular bottle of wine, I guarantee they will have it. We paired our dinner with a bottle of Diora 'Three Crowns' Red Blend, delicious!   If you're looking to get out for a dinner, special occasion or if you're not in the mood to cook and are looking for a true Italian restaurant, visit Spiga Cucina. Can't go wrong here, Dan's Italian, he knows his food and their food is a hit!"}
{"text":"Spiga is my new favorite Italian restaurant.The owner Fernando is a hands on guy - you see him working at the restaurant daily and jumps right in and serves ( food , drinks , water )his customers and greets you on arrival and thanks you as you leave . Now for the food , from the salads , appetizers, soups, pasta , fish all have been excellent. I've been here 4  times and each time left with my taste buds satisfied! Oh yeah great wine list, and full bar-- try the IG Martini."}
{"text":"Adding this spot to the date night rotation!! Yum!! Aside from the delicious, unique food, the servers and staff are stand out and polished."}
{"text":"Our group of four was excited to try Spiga, the hip new kid in town. We made a reservation for 4 for 7:30pm. We arrived at 5 'til. They asked if we wanted to \"wait just a moment\" while they made up a table in the \"private room\" or did we want to take the table next to the entrance? Seemed like a no-brainer. We chose the private room. A moment turned into two, turned into three. After about 15 minutes, we decided to get a drink at the bar while we waited. Of course, we had just gotten our drinks when the table became ready. The \"private\" room ended up being a large room with 4 or 5 tables off of the main room. Maybe they convert it into a private room when needed, but they shouldn't even call it a private room - it feels like a part of the restaurant. Regardless, the unexpected wait started us off on an awkward foot.  The ambiance is stellar. Old brick walls that curve at the ceiling, wooden beams, warm amber up-lighting. It felt like we were dining in an Italian wine cellar. Lovely. The bartender is excellent. I very much enjoyed the martini and my friend spoke highly of his old fashioned.  For appetizers, we ordered the calamari, octopus and the caprese 3-way . Like other reviewers have commented, it was good but not great. My friends noted that the octopus was cooked perfectly.  For dinner, we had chicken parm, seafood linguini, and short-rib ravioli. The chicken looked dry and was served on a plate separate from its accompanying pasta, which I thought odd. The seafood was cooked perfectly, but I felt the dish was heavy on the pasta and that the pasta was a little dry (needed more sauce?). The ravioli was good, but if you had asked us to try it blindfolded, we would never have guessed that it had meat in it. We asked the waitress about it, who explained that the meat was pureed and mixed with the cheese to make stuffing the ravioli easier.   Overall, I think Spiga has a lot of potential. Our awkward start is probably just a growing pain - new restaurants are bound to have kinks in customer service. If the food had been at the next level, this would have gotten 4 stars hands down and maybe even a 5 because the ambiance is so great. I wish the owners the best of luck!"}
{"text":"Had a great dinner at Spiga Cucina last night.  Being Italian I'm always searching for great Italian food and I was very impressed with Spiga Cucina.  They have a beautiful patio area which we really enjoyed. Weather was lovely and the ambience on the patio is wonderful. Our server, Adriana, was fabulous!  Her personality has you thinking you've known her for a long time. So friendly and sweet.  She gave us a great review of the most popular items on the menu, and quite honestly, it was hard to make a decision. Everything sounds wonderful.  We started with a burrata appetizer that was unbelievable!  Absolutely delicious! Adriana gave us a great selection for a red Italian wine. Very good choice.  I read that their portions are very generous so we decided to split an entree. Good decision. The pappardelle bolognese was delicious.  The pasta is homemade and you can taste the freshness. Just wonderful.  We're excited to go back and experience more of their delicious food."}
{"text":"Spiga is simply fantastic.  My husband and I have now been there at least six times.  On our second visit the manager, Fernando, recognized us and came over and really made us feel welcome.  On our fourth visit we had my mom with us and did not have a reservation.  The place was packed but the manager found us a table right away.  The food is also terrific. The burrata prepared in various  ways is delicious.  The short ribs literally melt in your mouth.  I cannot say enough about just about everything on the menu.     I also love that it is a classy place and people are well-dressed.  Do not show up in jeans!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Finally, after 15 years, a reason to stay North of the 101. Spiga, open about a month now may be the best Italian restaurant I've been to since moving here. It's hip, stylish, busy, happening and the food, service, prices, selection and ambiance kills on all levels. The owners, Fernando and Paula know restaurant management and they know how to keep people happy and engaged. With their happy hour, this may very well become my new \"Cheers.\" Bravissimo!"}
{"text":"New restaurant right up the street from my office so wanted to give it a try. A real selling point was the patio. They put alot of effort into making the patio really wonderful and spacious. The atmosphere was great. Very impressed with the Chef's selection of meats and cheeses for an appetizer. The pizza was good and so was the pasta dish. They both were just a little bland but still had good flavor. I would definitely try it again."}
{"text":"We love a good Italian restaurant so we decided to drive from Surprise to check out the newly opened place. The ambiance was superb and the staff that greeted us were friendly. We didn't have a reservation and we showed up at 7:15pm on a Friday night. We waited for about 15 minutes which wasn't bad at all,  but I would recommend a reservation. We were seated in the bar area and our server David R. was relaxed, well spoken & made us feel right at home. He was knowledgable about the menu & helped us decide on certain items from the menu. Our food was great, fresh & served with a smile. We had the calamari and stuffed beets as an appetizer. Then we shared the Bufalina pizza which was plenty to share so that we could order dessert too. Then we had the  tiramisu & warm chocolate cake with vanilla bean gelato. We will be back to sample the great variety of menu choices."}
{"text":"Food was good however we have no idea what is occurring in the kitchen. To be specific, within the dining area- it was a fly paradise. After initially sitting and ordering a pizza and bottle of wine, there was a fly buzzing around. We initially thought that this was a run of the mill fly so we continued our stay. Once the food was delivered, multiple flies came out and were landing on our pizza, water and wine bottle. After constantly swatting for 2-3 minutes, we said enough is enough. We turned to find our waiter who was no where in site so we waved down one of the cooks who subsequently contacted a floor person. The floor person came to our table and we told him we are done eating and drinking and we are leaving without paying. The floor person said no worries, you're taken care of. We got up and left. If there is a fly problem in the dining area, who knows what's going on in the kitchen. If the floor person had no problem waiving the cost of the meal and wine, it seems to me that he's already aware of the problem.  Very sad.  In this day and age, you would think that people would have pride in their work. Two thumbs way down!"}
{"text":"Very Nice! Atmosphere, Patio, Staff. The owner is kind and very hands on which is important. That's what separates the bullshit corporate chains from the real hard working owners that care about good food and what they deliver to their customers day in and day out. I am all about locally owned and operated. You want a go to and get excellent? this is for sure a stop you should make."}
{"text":"Firstly , our waiter ( the gentleman from Texas) is wonderful.... The food is fine, not great. Nice wine list. The noise level is way way to loud......like dining in a high school cafeteria ,,,,,,drppped a star because of that."}
{"text":"Super yummy and authentic. Great for a date night or family outing. We like to bring out of town people. Not your run of the mill - cookie cutter Italian food. The seafood is delicious. Beautiful environment and attentive staff too."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, and the appetizers are perfect for sharing with 2 to 3 people.  From the apps menu we had the octopus, shrimp, and meatballs.  All three were very good.  I especially liked the creaminess of the polenta from the meatball plate.  The romesco sauce on the octopus was also the perfect mix  of spicy and salty. The pizza was also a surprise.  I'd have to say it's on par with some of the best in the valley.  We ordered the buffalina (I think).  All in all a great meal.  I'm also a sucker for a great grapefruit cocktail, and their basil grapefruit martini didn't disappoint.  I also thought that the atmosphere was beautiful with a great use of space and decor.  5 stars for sure, and I'll look forward to taking out of town guests here as my way of silently bragging that I live in Scottsdale and they don't :)"}
{"text":"We really love the makeover of this restaurant!   There are plenty of elegant indoor & outdoor seating options.  If your looking for more casual you can also sit at the outdoor bar with a view of the tv.  I appreciate the menu that is not over done just a decent variety of well prepared & great tasting dishes.  The happy hour offers both food & drinks on special which is nice.   That said, the service lags behind the pricing - a couple of examples,  we've been there twice and the servers do not seem to know the menu.  They are friendly but cant describe the menu items or offer suggestions.   Also they dont offer to crack pepper on your meals - at both visits we asked for pepper and a pepper mill was tossed on our table.  Lastly they serve table water in charming glass bottles but it taste like tap - is it too much to add a cucumber slice or lemon wedge?  We will certainly visit again but we are hoping the service will  catch up to their potential."}
{"text":"Great food and incredible service. This family owned restaurant is the reason people like to eat out."}
{"text":"Ask for Jon. Absolutely the most knowledgeable and pleasant server you could ask for.  Had all courses and everything was authentic and well done. Perfect proportions and extensive wine list.   Reasonably priced. Recommend for a date night or dinner meeting. Even better ambiance at night."}
{"text":"My wife and I came for Sunday lunch. The restaurant was about 1/4 full. Quiet place which we love. Beautiful day in Scottsdale so we sat near open windows.   The food was amazing. We started with the octopus dish. Very tender. Both of use loved the bread basket. Richly crusted soft in the middle bread with a hummus like dip. Really nice. I had the buccitini pasta which I love. Perfectly cooked al-denti. My wife had the kale salad which she said was vey good. I also had a pizza.  The salacci which was essentially a wonderful sausage pizza. My wife had the bolognese pasta which she said was very very good.   The service was a tad slow to start but after that it was excellent.   Overall I give it 5/5 my wife gives it 5/5. Service 5/5."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed. Can't wait to come back and try more. Had the Veal chop. Tasty but a little under cooked. Great 3 way caprese salad we shared.  Lisa had the salmon. Nice.  Great service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"This restaurant is difficult to rate because some things they do VERY WELL and other plates might be disappointing.   I don't agree with some reviewers about the noise problem. Perhaps in some parts of the restaurant there is an issue with noise. The restaurant was packed and energetic with noise but nothing terrible. You could have a conversation without a problem or at least we were able to.  If I have to sum up what I think about the restaurant they do non-Italian food well and don't really offer that much Italian Food.  We started with good fresh crusty bread but it came with hummus. I liked the hummus but my husband was very disappointed with hummus and would have preferred Olive Oil or butter.   I had the (pasta free) beet raviolis. I thought they were a very clever dish that was delicious. Thin Slices of beet roots stuffed with goat cheese and a little citrus and other toppings that made them pop with flavor.  I didn't feel like going with my usual fish and vegetable dinner so I just had the kale salad. It was dressed nicely and was a tasty salad. I liked it.  My husband couldn't find many classic Italian Dishes on the menu like saltimbocca or maybe a shank Osso Bucco kind of dish but settled for the Bolognese. He said his pasta stuck together and the sauce lacked flavor.   I think this restaurant would rate higher if they dropped the Cucina from their name.  3.5 stars"}
{"text":"The food, the ambience, and the owner Fernando makes this place extra special! I've been telling friends what an awesome place Spiga is. Date night is in order at Spiga."}
{"text":"I love this place - I eat here all the time.  I always get the Fig, Proscuitto, Goat cheese, and Arugula pizza.  It's always consistently good.  They have a great caesar salad too - the dressing is awesome.  I've also had the Pappardelle Bolognese, which was also wonderful. My husband has had several different items from the seafood linguini to risotto to other types of pizzas -- everything has been great.  They also have a really good house red sangria.  The grandma's cake (torta della nonna) is hands down one of my favorite desserts out there, ever (and I am a dessert freak!). This place is definitely one of my go-to restaurants in North Scottsdale.  Looking forward to going back soon!"}
{"text":"There is a lot of good to be said about this beautiful new restaurant in North Scottsdale. The restaurant itself is lovely with a patio that will be awesome when the weather permits. The service  was fantastic but I let the waiter choose my wine from the choice of 2 Pinot Noirs and he chose the more expensive one. I expected that but hoped to be surprised or at least advised. He was attentive, informative ( other than the wine choice) and efficient. The food was good with a Capitol G. Not great. Everything needed salt and no, I am not an habitual salt user. The portions were huge, the ingredients fresh but everything was flat. It needed salt AND there is no salt and pepper on the table. The bread should be better and tho it is different, the hummus they served with it doesn't really fit in an Italian restaurant and did not have much flavor. All in all we enjoyed our dinner and will be back, just this time we will bring our own salt shaker!"}
{"text":"If you want a wonderful experience ...this is the place  GREAT environment....Delicious food !  We eat at the wonderful place a lot  Owner is always their to accommodate you ...no matter what!  Somewhat noisy inside ...but the outside patio is awesome!  Try it you'll love this consistent place to dine!"}
{"text":"Spaghetti meat sauce ($18) was great. Atmosphere is nice. I don't think I'd do pizza $(17) next time but it was good."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! I love the food!! I've never had a bad experience here whether I'm sitting in the bar area or at a table. All the servers are super attentive and always have a smile on their face!! I eat here a few times a month. Ashley and Wade are the BEST!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went tonight.   100x better environment than Xtapa ever was.   David was our server, and he was outstanding.   My wife ordered the pollo arrosto, and the entire dish was incredible. The flavor and the veggies were a perfect fit.   I ordered the pollo parmigiana, and it is the best I've ever had. I paired it with a laguntias IPA, and I strongly recommend that.   Everything was perfect. They won my stomach space tonight, and many nights to come!"}
{"text":"Nicely appointed setting and the defacto spot in North Scottsdale now that Sassi is closing.  Some of the best bolognese I've had in town and the burrata was some of the creamiest I've ever had.  I've only begun to explore the menu and plan on a few more visits to accomplish the task.  Definitely deserves a solid following."}
{"text":"We've had dinner here several times and throughly enjoyed every dish. Very nice atmosphere and pleasant servers. It's nice that the owner is always there and is always making sure people are enjoying themselves. Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Just an incredible dinner - my hubby and I had the roasted calamari - yum - then had the mussels with fresh tomatoes and crazy good broth with warm toast for dipping - Yes!  Our server, Heather, was incredible!  Great sense of humor - super making recommendations.  My husband's dinner was a pasta with chicken where he substituted red sauce for a creamy sauce.  Drinks fabulous. Definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great staff, ambience and loved all of the food we ordered. Nice wine menu too.  Very reasonable priced for the quality."}
{"text":"Great menu. Pasta was delicious. Pizza flavor was excellent but unfortunately crust became very soggy fast. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came here tonight for dinner with the family.  As the other reviewers have mentioned, the calamari was perfection on a plate.   I had the prosciutto pizza and it was amazing. Other members of my party had the potato soup, spaghetti, or salmon and they all raved about it.   My sister and I also indulged on (several) of their sangria cocktails. Mind you, whatever was in that glass, was not the traditional wine and fruit, but it was damn delicious!   My only suggestion is that they add bruschetta to the menu. What Italian restaurant doesn't have bruschetta?   The wait staff was definitely not bad to look at either. I will definitely be coming back for nothing else but the view."}
{"text":"Wonderful staff. Absolutely love the decor. Definitely would come back and would be sure to bring another couple. Great value for high end Italian food. Superb variety with fantastic flavors."}
{"text":"Great food and service. We come out here once or twice a year and this is always a go-to. Best Bolognese I've ever had."}
{"text":"We live in Carefree year round.  We met some friends at Spiga for happy hour and got there early (before 4pm) because we wanted to make sure we got seats at the outdoor bar.   Everything was great until about 15 minutes before we left and there was a shift change at the bar.  Our bartender was a lovely girl \"Jackie\" and we had no problems.  Then a group of 4 regulars came in hovering around our seats.   I told them we would be leaving soon and they were welcome to our seats.  They went inside and sat at the bar and got the bartender (not Jackie but the new shift bartender) to put \"reserved\" signs at our seats.  No problem....yet!!!!  I had ordered a desert to go and while we were paying our check, the new shift bartender sent all 4 guests out to take our seats!  So we were pushed out and left standing waiting for our desert.  Unbelievable. I guess Spiga's management thinks some guests are more important than others.  I for one will not be going there again.  We have too many places where our patronage is welcomed and valued (Creek Patio!!!) to be bothered with Spiga's elitist attitude."}
{"text":"Our first visit was extremely disappointing. The front desk staff told us she would check us into Open Table and did not. Happy Hour was lame with one mediocre white and one lackluster red wine offered! Our servers did not listen to requests such as dressing on the side, gluten free pasta, and brought the wrong entree. Service was slow despite it being 4:30 p.m. The food was some of the worst we've ever had - the menu listed a sun-dried sauce with chicken, roasted red peppers and olives. What arrived was orange-coated chewy penne with a few small bites of chicken and no peppers or olives.  The servers were un-inspiring, couldn't carry on a conversation.  This place better get their act together fast as they will not compete with the surrounding restaurants.  It's a shame as we live around the corner and had high hopes for this restaurant. We are going to give Spiga one more try this week and that will determine whether we will ever be back."}
{"text":"Only go here if you have 5 hours to kill. Terrible service. The restaurant was 90% empty when we arrived. Ordered an appetizer and nothing came forever. Asked another waiter to check on it and he never did. Finally saw our waitress again and reminded her of the order. She forgot to put it in. Waited forever for our food. Asked hostess to get the manager. She never did. We finally left with no food. I called he manager. He said no one ever alerted him that we wanted to see him. Major problems for this place."}
{"text":"1st time trying this place and wished we tried it sooner. Much more authentic than the places we have been going at Scottsdale quarter & kierland. Service was excellent & our server Rodrigo was super attentive. Great wine selection to fit our different tastes. We could eat the grilled octopus & burrata with smoked salmon almost everyday. The homemade pappardelle was cooked to perfection. Only desired more of it than the accompanied meat sauce. Wish we had the appetite to try their pizzas & desserts but definitely next time."}
{"text":"Treat yourself to great food in Scottsdale. Locally owned, short ribs and caprese salad are the best. Service is excellent but slow as the attitude is that you are there to enjoy the evening. Good wine selection."}
{"text":"WE WILL NOT BE BACK. ROCKS AND PLASTIC IN SEAFOOD! Normally this restaurant was our favorite go to for Italian in North Scottsdale but after tonight both meals were a huge fail. My grouper which was the special of the night had a sharp chunk of plastic in it which I bit down on, then my husbands Linguini Nero which he has gotten many times had sand and a very large rock which he almost ate! I understand it was busy this night but its disapointing that the owner dismissed the situation with excuses for the kitchen like it was no big deal it happens all the time, his exact words..."}
{"text":"Delicious food!!! This place used to be X-tapas and they have done a great job remodeling it.  Nice open place with tons of windows.  I had Pappardelle Bolognese, the meats were so juicy.   The wife had the risotto funghi which was also yummy,  Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why we keep trying this place yearly, but I do know we always say yeah we're not going to come back. This restaurant has  is beautiful and has a nice crowd of all ages.  Staff is very professional.  The problem is the food.  It's not bad, it's just okay.  The grilled octopus looked amazing, but sadly was overlooked and salty.  Our pastas looked beautiful, but had no taste.  It was so bland.  Sadly, they don't offer salt on the table, so we couldn't fix our dishes. With that being said, it's not worth the price.  We've been here 5 times and it still tastes the same.  I think if you are meeting up with people, it's a great place for drinks.  Other than that, drive south.  It does so well because this is the most decent restaurant (non-chain) you will find in this area."}
{"text":"I have been to Spiga twice now as I only recently moved to the area and only spend winter here in Scottsdale. I find it difficult to put into words the wonderful experience I had dining here. The food is amazing from the antipasto, appetizers, main courses all the way through dessert, we thoroughly enjoyed and were delighted with the food here. We ordered branzino, spaghetti amoré, spaghetti with meatballs, an assortment of cheeses and cured meats. All were AMAZING!! The service was beyond incredible and we were treated like family. We even got to meet the owners who were absolutely incredible people with a passion for food and service. When in Scottsdale, this is a must try for food, drinks and a good time!!!"}
{"text":"Spiga Cucina is a great option for Italian food located in North Scottsdale. It can get busy so reservations are a must. We got a table near the kitchen, so it was kinda loud, but we made the most of it. We were greeted by our server, with waters as soon as we sat down.   After reviewing the wine list, which offers a great selection of Italian wines, I had narrowed my selection down to a few, so I asked the man standing nearby, who clearly not a server, his thoughts. It turns out, Fernando is the owner.  He steered us to one of the wines, a Vietti Nebbiolo, which was outstanding.  Our server told us about the specials, including a grouper and also an Osso Buco, which both sounded great, but you need to be hungry to tackle a Buco by yourself.  We ended up going with the Tortiglioni Portobello dish and the Veal Saltimbocca.  My veal was great and I would order that again.  The veal was wrapped with prosciutto with a sage seasoning. The fresh veggies added to the dish.  There was no room for desert, but we left very satisfied!"}
{"text":"My wife and I took this restaurant in recently and could not of been more pleased. We ate in the outdoor patio, which was really more of them have a hybrid indoor/outdoor patio and it was a wonderful atmosphere.  The food could not of been better. I had the small Italian salad and we split one of the pasta dishes. Both were fabulous. Additionally, to make things better my waiter poured me a wonderful bourbon with a very generous pour.   For the money, the place was terrific. Hard to envision a better meal in North Scottsdale with Italian food. We had and still enjoy Sassi, but portions twice as big here for same amount of money. Highly recommend and do not feel anybody will be disappointed with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"Not sure what happened to this place. About a year ago this place was really consistent and the food was good. The last couple of times we have been here the food hasn't tasted the same or has been cold. Tonight we dined here and my husbands dish came out cold. We sent it back and the server brought back the same dish heated up after our entire table was done eating. That is fine and all but I think it's in poor taste to not send a manager over to the table to apologize for the inconvenience.  You can go to a chain like Cheesecake Factory and get better care. I don't need a handout but there was no consolation offered. I don't think that I will be dining here anymore. Extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Food and drinks are very fairly priced, and the service was fantastic. Our waiter recommended a great wine paring to my Pork tenderloin (cooked to perfection). Usually I'm concerned a bit that they are trying to upsell you to the most expensive glass, but it was one of the cheapest on the menus. Will definitely go back here if we are back in Scottsdale again."}
{"text":"I've been to Spiga probably half a dozen times, and every time is amazing. I am one of those people that tries to get something different every time I go to a restaurant. Everything on the menu here sounds amazing, so I'll have to go back for sure many more times. Everything that I have already tried is fantastic.  I'm not much of a review writer, but you all should know about this spot.   So...I'll pick a variety of recommended dishes by course. The beet \"ravioli\" salad is great- nice and light, juicy sliced beets with creamy goat cheese. The salsiccia  pizza is amazing, thin crust italian-style, flavorful sausage and peppers, nice and crisp but not dry. The pollo parmigiana is a great lunch entree - so tender, sauce flavor and amount just right. Dinner entrees- I tend to try the specials, had Osso Buco recently which was phenomenal, extremely tender.   What really pulls this place together though is the atmosphere. It's beautiful inside, and it's got a nice calming effect even while busy (There is usually a crowd for dinner, so I'd suggest reservations especially if you're a party of more than two.) There are plenty of indoor seats for the heat of summer, but also a great patio area to take advantage of the weather the rest of the year.   I really like it as a lunch spot also. It's the same great food and you can sit and enjoy a leisurely lunch while being taken care of by the excellent staff.  My server cued me in to the pollo parmigiana last time, which otherwise may be easy to overlook with all the more unusual dishes fighting for attention. Definitely glad he suggested that!!  Also, the owner Fernando is very involved and caring towards guests. He always comes by and makes sure everything is just right."}
{"text":"Some of the best Italian and pizza in Scottsdale. Definitely sit at the bar on date night and order the sea food board the name escapes me at present. Tables outside with their fire features are super cool and the whole place is a swanky vibe but surprisingly not super expensive, not inexpensive but a super value considering the food rocks! Fettuccine is a strong one here too, sea food pastas, gluten free options, fantastic wine selection, several nice beers and a great crowd with excellent service. I give it my signature #gotonight"}
{"text":"The owner is a fantastic guy and he has created a high quality restaurant.  Unfortunately, we are a true Italian family and we judge Italian restaurants by how close they come to real Italian cuisine.  This is definitely an American version of Italian food.  The homemade pasta is delicious but the sauces are too heavy and too much.  I haven't tried i secondi.  They looked good and I would potentially come back for that.  The wine list is outstanding with a variety of excellent wines at all price levels.  The atmosphere is lovely and chic and the place is hopping with customers--in other words great vibe.  I don't know why restauranteurs feel the need to hire young attractive maitre'ds who never smile and aren't welcoming.  To the young ladies who seat customers here, the clients notice when you are indifferent to them--smile and pretend that you enjoy your job.  The only true Italian restaurants we have found in Scottsdale are Andreolis, Trattoria Veneto and Pomo.  The rest are an American version of Italian food."}
{"text":"This place is beautiful and the staff is very friendly, welcoming, and good at what they do. My colleague and I sat at the bar and the bartender was well versed at the menu and seemed to have tried a good deal of it. I really enjoy when the staff is willing to make a recomendation and she hit it out of the park.   I enjoyed a very good shrimp pasta dish here. The pasta was not the star. The shrimp and the sauce were."}
{"text":"This place is a major ripoff. The food is passable, but the service is unacceptable, slow and inattentive.   More to the point, We decided to give it another try for New Year's Eve, with a party of eight, including four children. Four  days before our reservation, Spiga called to inform us that dinner would be ONLY a four course fixed price ($60) for everyone.  This hardly works for the four children.  This information was not posted on their we site, so we were blindsided by the call.  Thanks, Spiga, for leaving us to scramble at least he last minute.   This is the ultimate in poor service."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night.  We did have a reservation and we were seated right away.  We had the whole outside to ourselves.  It's a beautiful space with great ambiance.  There were a few TV's outside and misters going on high.  The menu has something for everyone.  Extensive wine list (lots of Italian wines).  Wine prices are OK only about 100% markup so that wasn't bad.  Started with the Spiga salad and we loved it! Fresh and light...I highly recommend it.  Base on a Yelp review that I read earlier in the day, I recommend the chicken parmesan for my husband since this is his favorite dish, so he ordered that, I ordered the parpedella Bolognese.  The chicken parmesan was the thickness of cardboard and tasted about the same. Dry, chewy, tasteless...very disappointing.  The pasta that was his side dish was good. My dish was average - I did expect a little more based on the reviews.    We will come back again to try some other dishes and hopefully hit a home run on our food order.  Our waiter was great. The bathrooms were clean and there is plenty of parking nearby."}
{"text":"I think people in N. Scottsdale want a good restaurant up here so badly that they are willing to fool themselves. I walked in and wanted the same way. The restaurant is beautiful! I wanted so bad to like this place. The lettuce in my salad had frozen spots and tasteless. I overlooked that. The clams and mussels were bad. They had complaints that night of the same thing and still served them to me. The owner never apologized. Kitchen and service was slow. A first and last for me."}
{"text":"The best Italian food in town.  The seafood/Italian combinations are the best I've come across in the Phoenix area.  Can't wait to come back again and try other specialties.  The wine selection is really good too.  The ambiance is very pretty and it's super loud when the place is packed due to good food and drinks.  All the people seem happy which gives you a warm welcoming feeling.  Service is just right, as you're not being rushed out or rushed to order.  A true European feel vs other restaurants where the waiter/waitress is there every minute and handing you a check the following minute."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times but I most recently went for Arizona Restaurant Week with a group of four. It's finally getting cooler here in AZ so we sat on the patio. I forgot our servers name but he was excellent, not too overbearing, but always there when we needed him. My boyfriend and I both got the restaurant week menu which included a first course of tuna carpaccio and a kale salad. I thought I was going to prefer the tuna but honestly they were both equally delicious and I can't decide which one I like more. For entrées I got the pan roasted rack of lamb with a creamy truffle polenta and roasted Brussel sprouts. Now, I prefer my meat rare but that's a little too much to handle for my boyfriend so we got it medium rare. The flavor was great and it was cooked exactly to order. I would maaaaaaybe consider ordering it that way in the future! Our other entrée was the white Seabass that was pan seared with a sweet pea risotto, roasted tomatoes, rapini, and a roasted corn nage. The fish was perfectly cooked and deliciously flaky, and paired well with its accompaniments. We each got one dessert- I can't believe we managed to eat! I got the Panna Cotta with a mixed berry compote that was not too sweet or overbearing. I could almost trick myself into thinking it was yogurt! The traditional vanilla bean crème brûlée was served with mango gelato on top which was an interesting combination. It worked really well with the mild taste of the vanilla and crunchy sugar. Will definitely be back! Ciao!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch the other day and really liked the ambiance of this restaurant. Located in North Scottsdale, has a very inviting decor. We sat at the patio as the weather started to cool down. Weekday lunch, this place wasn't busy at all.   I like the orange paste thing they served with the bread. I wish I knew what it was. I ate them so quick before I had time to think about what they were. For lunch, I had pappardelle bolognese. It is classic bolognese with veal, beef & pork, black pepper-crusted ricotta. Pasta served with this dish is flat, and unfortunately they couldn't leave the texture I was hoping to taste when it was served. Ricotta cheese blended with tomato sauce well, I never thought of adding ricotta cheese to my meat sauce, and I was pleasantly surprised with the combination of this cheese and sauce.  Meat sauce came with plenty of meat and the lunch sat heavy for a while.  Very meaty pasta, should have came hungry or skipped that bread.  They had nice list of desert but since the pasta was so much, I couldn't try any of them. Next time I will order something light to make room for desert."}
{"text":"We had lunch today at Spiga.  The restaurant is just beautiful and they have a great patio. I had the Caesar salad and I loved it and I am very picky on my Caesar salads!   :)  The soup that my husband had was also very good.  It was Italian sausage and white bean soup and it was delicious.  Our server, whose name was James was outstanding!!!! He was honestly one of the best servers we have had. We will definately come back again."}
{"text":"Spiga is most definitely a keeper!  From ambiance to staff/service and every little bite in between!  Great menu with something for everyone -even the most picky!   YES-House made pasta!  So few spots have superb bread-thanks Spiga!   Did I mention the meatballs ? Well, just go yourself!  Just ten minutes north of Kierland-head up soon!"}
{"text":"Good service, good food. The place is loud and food from kitchen is slow but that's because they are busy. Can't knock that. Pleasant staff"}
{"text":"Wonderful sunset views...beautiful restaurant inside or outside on huge patio, nice roomy bar has lots of seats inside and some outside on bar. But the best is their food! Wonderful Italian and the prices are very reasonable and portion sizes very good. You must try! Faces Pinn Peak Rd just east of big corner shopping center..."}
{"text":"This was our first visit. The ambiance is spectacular, lots of brick, wooden ceilings, sleek lines in the dining room and a generous patio. The service was excellent, very attentive, We shared a caesar salad that had just the right amount of garlic and was large for $9. I had the 12 OZ. New Strip Steak, with a red wine/ marsala sauce that makes me drool while writing this. It came with grilled asparagus and garlic mash potatoes that were out of this world; $29. Well worth it. My husband had the sausage, marinated tomato, grilled onion and pepper pizza, thin crust and 12\": $17. Excellent. For dessert we had the three gelato: hazelnut , strawberry, pistachio, WOW!!! I had the Creme Brûlée, OH MY GOD!!!! YUM! This is a definite place I will return to . Our entire bill was $79 which I thought was reasonable. I brought half my dinner home for a second meal. I love the they take reservations."}
{"text":"Excellant food and service last night at this \"new to us\" restaurant. I had the mussela appetizer. Plenty of delicious mussels in a fabulous bread sopping tomato,garlic,wine sauce. I followed that with the beet\"raviolli\". Thinly sliced beete with goats cheese sandwiched between slices with a,few dressed greens on top. My husband went for the veal chop, which was pricey,  but a bone gnawing piece of deliciousness he said. Complete with excellent veges (does anyone like broccoli rabi?) and Yummy mashed potatoes.  Drinks were very good and considering how busy the place was, the wait for drinks and food was acceptable. WOW was it ever noisy though! Don't know if it is the accoustics or just an abundance of very happy people. Hands on management and ownership is always good to see. We will definately be back. A very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"We loved this place from the minute we walked in. The setting and atmosphere is upbeat. The service was excellent very attentive whether we were in the bar or seated at our table. Food was excellent we had seafood entrees and pasta. We will return loved it!"}
{"text":"This was the worst Italian Restaurant we have ever been to. Food was horrible excuse for Italian and service was the absolute worst. Our waitress was more concerned with tending to the people in the bar than to us. As an example, it took an act of congress just to get some parmesan cheese. Sorry excuse for an Italian Restaurant. We'll continue to go to Uncle Sal's in South Scottsdale. They are the best."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, friendly staff!  Food was delicious and the portions size was good. Our meal surprisingly came quick!  Definitely will go again and bring friends"}
{"text":"We decided to meet some great friends here for dinner. What a great choice it was.  It's Easter Sunday so the place wasn't crowded.   As we walked in we were greeted by the hostess, who was polite and had a great attitude.   This place has an amazing outside area. The sun was shining and the breeze was perfect for an outside patio dinner.   Let's get to the food......wowwwwww! I love authentic Italian food so this place was just what the doctor ordered.  The appetizer was superb!!!! We had shrimp in white wine sauce, shallots, lots of garlic with crusty Italian bread. I'm in heaven.   The appetizer was so good that when you order the main course your already full. Dinner was shrimp with home-made pasta.  Look I love shrimp. Don't judge me!!! LOL   Dessert was yummy!!!! Tiramisu..... What a healthy portion  I was able to take left overs...  I definitely recommend this place but make sure you bring your hardy appetite."}
{"text":"My first time at this restaurant and it was a wonderful experience. We order the seafood platter for 2 and it was absolutely amazing!! Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We had an enjoyable lunch with the best pasta dishes we can remember. Great server & pretty views, so glad we came."}
{"text":"Went out with the in-laws and family to this restaurant because it was literally a 1 min walk from my house. I was blown away by the ambiance and overall clean feel of the restaurant. I personally met the owner who I knew was the owner because of a video on Yelp when I checked in. I was impressed with the quality of the food. I had the short rib and the taste did not disappoint. They gave out free bread with a spread that tasted wonderful. My only complaint is the price for quantity ratio. I came pretty hungry and had to fill up on bread because the portions were not robust. If I had to do it over I would order a salad and soup to add some courses with the main dish. My pockets would have to be a bit deeper as well."}
{"text":"I'd describe the restaurant as a step or two above a Midwestern Italian (read that as Olive Garden) but with a few sparks, like the octopus appetizer, which was well prepared though skimpy.  Pappardelle was on the bland side, and Caesar salad unexceptional.    The restaurant was very loud and filled by 7:15 p.m. on a Tuesday evening.  Service and timing of food delivery was bordering on poor."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried this place out because it is very close to our home. We had a 30 minute wait which is normal for a Friday night. The mussels where very fresh and the sauce had great flavor. I had the veal piccata and it was ok. The veal was not as tender and the sauce lacked any lemon flavor. I must say it is very loud inside. Next time will try sitting on the patio. I have hear the calamari is excellent! Will try it next time. Our server never told me her name and the service overall was just ok."}
{"text":"What can I say about a great place such as this. The atmosphere was great the dinning area provided an relaxing experience and allowed for my girlfriend and I to enjoy the food to another level. I had the Chilean sea bass and it was cooked very well and the veggies were sautéed to perfection.  The wine recommendation made by the waiter was great and I will be looking forward to a great experience again in the near future."}
{"text":"My husband found this place and we both loved it. We agreed that my meal was better than any Italian dish we've ever had and we were in Italy just last fall! I had the Nero Linguine with all kinds of delicious seafood- clams,shrimp, scallops, etc. The sauce, noodles and seafood were all amazing. I'm so glad our server suggested it. We also shared a bottle of rose and it was amazing as well. My husband had the ravioli stuffed with spare ribs and it was good, but nowhere close to my meal!"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant with my girlfriends for her birthday party on a Saturday night with no reservation and the manager was able to get me a table. We ordered drinks and they were amazing. The server gave us some great recommendations because we weren't familiar with the menu. Everything that we ordered tasted amazing and we had absolutely no issues. It was a little loud in the dining room but overall, we were very happy with the service and the experience and we will be back, the spiga salad and chicken spaghetti was to die for. Our server was so friendly and adorable, I don't remember his name but he had the prettiest blue eyes I've ever seen. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Our favorite spot by far! Family feel, the owner greets you at the door with a smile. Must try the mussels marinara appetizer! Service is friendly and professional. The only thing better than the food is the wine selection. Will definitely come back, soon!"}
{"text":"What a phenomenal restaurant! I am a critical new yorker who knows her italian food. One of my biggest struggles with living in AZ is finding good italian food We had the bolognese which was perfect! We also enjoy the fish special which was a halibut- cooked perfectly with excellent sides. The service was great and the atmosphere was very appealing. Well done Spiga"}
{"text":"Excellent and a beautiful restaurant!  I was visiting from Las Vegas and when I arrived I was so impressed.  The restaurant is so upscale and the wine selection is large and reasonable too.  The pasts was excellent  and the kale salad a must.  Portions are large too."}
{"text":"If you are a fan of real, authentic Italian style pizza... THIS IS THE BEST ITALIAN STYLE PIZZA I'VE EVER ENJOYED OUTSIDE OF ITALY!!!  That is saying much, as I love pizza.     We have been there before for dinner and lunch on several occasions and it has always been top notch.  I have a favorite New York style pizzeria here in the neighborhood and never once thought to try Spiga Cucina for pizza until yesterday.  I am very grateful I did, as their pizza is perfectly cooked just like you were ordering in Florence, Venice, or Rome, Italy!  Their pizzas are a little on the expensive side but worth every cent!   If you have ever enjoyed a real pizza made in Italy, this is THE PLACE to enjoy the same in Scottsdale, AZ. Bar none!  Warning: if you have never had real Italian style pizza, this is not like a NY or Chicago style pizza.  They are smaller and more crafted.   We ordered 3:  Margherita Classico, Prosciutto, and a Bufalina.  To say they were DELICIOUS is a gross understatement!  Both the inside of the restaurant and the outside patio are gorgeous.  They have plenty of parking to boot.  The staff are warm and inviting. When I called in my order, I had a few questions and the Italian woman on the phone was so patient and informative.  I am a self proclaimed pizza freak...  I will be back several times a month now.  Grazie!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing place for an event and family meals awsomest owner knows how to do it all. Thank you Spiga for an amazing dinner and service."}
{"text":"Came her on Monday night to celebrate something special. The food was on point. The patio was awesome and the manager sent a complimentary delicious dessert for our celebration. It was delicious and awesome. We will be back!!!!!"}
{"text":"Bravo Fernando!  Fantastic food fun lively atmosphere and great bartenders!!  The meatballs for Happy Hour are top shelf.  My new favorite restaurant in AZ.  I'm from the Bay Area and Fernando is as good as any owner and Host.  He always makes you feel at home.  Cheers, CJK"}
{"text":"Great Italian food, authentic with very good wine list.  The Octopus is just fantastic"}
{"text":"Great place. Wonderful atmosphere and happy people (our bartender, Jeff, was funny and had a contagious laugh)! I 've lived in the neighborhood for years and X-tapa joes had to go!! Spiga has redone the outside and more importantly the inside. Looks and feels great, warm woods and rustic bricks. The menu has something for everyone. We started with the beef carpaccio, beet salad, and meatballs. The meatballs were something to rival my mothers and the beets were craftily stuffed with goat cheese. Next we shared a Spiga salad with a champagne vinaigrette, which was like a delightful anti pasta  salad. I had the bolognese, meaty and fresh flavors. my guest had the short ribs, which were full of flavor, smooth polenta, hot and delicious. Good news, we took some of both home to make room for desert. Choose the bouchon for desert, it was very rich, but amazingly delightful with flavors warm chocolatey flavors. All in all...A huge upgrade to the neighborhood and a much needed Italian spot in north Scottsdale. We will be back for sure!! Great job to the owners and management team!"}
{"text":"Italian food that is supreme with great choices in seafood and fresh made pastas that are cooked to perfection.   Contemporary flavors in a creative menu that delivers gastro pleasure.  One of our favorite restaurants.  Great happy hour deals.  Beautiful open patio.  Clean contemporary bathroom."}
{"text":"So excited to have such a great restaurant closer to home!  Our first visit tonight and I my family is still raving about it. We had chicken parm and even though they didn't have my son's favorite dish on the menu they made it for him anyway. All of it was amazing. We finished up with tiramisu and it was also delicious. Portions are generous and they have a great wine selection. The service was also impeccable. We will definitely tell our friends and we will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Best Italian restaurants ever, they have the best seafood I have ever you can taste the freshness of the fish! my favorite is grouper and yellow tail which they have occasionally I wish they add the yellowtail fish on the menu.  keep the good quality work, and thanks for making us The best food you can."}
{"text":"The resturant is beautiful inside. The atmosphere is fantastic and it feels like you step into an Italian village. The wine bottles all around set the ambiance conducive to your dining experience. The quality of the food was four star, the taste was not perfect and some sauce was bland. I had a chicken parmesan type of dish, and the chicken was super thin and slightly crispy. I anticipated a thicker cut of chicken. The pasta to the side of the chicken was ok, like the pasta part was good, yet the sauce wasn't packed with a flavor explosion you'd think for a $24 dollar menu item at lunch. The deserts were phenomenal with the exception of the over cooked chocolate cake (dry). The staff were excellent and very attentive, always on top of any needs or questions. I will for sure go again and recommend this place."}
{"text":"My hubby and I went for lunch for my birthday. Everything was delicious. We ordered the 2 apps. The polpo alla grigilia and the gambrei limone. Delicious!! We also ordered and shared a pizza. The salsiccia. Fantastic!! Our server was very friendly. He apologized for the delays because they were busy. I didn't understand because there weren't that many people . Maybe the short staffed the day after Easter??? I wanted to try dessert but each item I wanted wasn't available. Our server said they were out of many of the desserts because of Easter was busy. I find that odd since Ann Y's review said it wasn't crowded on Easter.  We will be back and I hope more desserts are available."}
{"text":"Che peccato! Spiga's menu has some nice offerings and actually the food was a-ok, But the service was unfortunate. Our group of four adults and two toddlers was treated like an afterthought pretty much from the moment we were seated. Not sure if it was an issue of being understaffed or that our server, Alex was not pleased to see that our group included babies. I've worked in restaurants- front and back of the house and couldn't imagine giving such bad service to anyone. Everything was painfully slow. From taking our drink orders to waiting for the drinks to even getting bread, pepper, and even a high chair for one of the kids. We had to ask and ask and ask. Not just once but numerous times for the same items over and over. Honestly- the basics of customer service were completely missed.   As far as the meal goes, my husband and I shared the Caesar salad. I ordered the papardelle bolognese. The noodles are made fresh.  They were good but very sticky. The sauce was on the thicker side but overall a decent dish. My husband had the pork saltimbocca. It was good. Portions are generous and the prices are average.   The food was tasty but certainly doesn't make up for the lack of service. And the service we did get was unpleasant. With so many choices i won't return to Spiga and likely won't recommend it. Mi dispiace!"}
{"text":"It was okay. The food was nothing spectacular, some of the dishes came out missing ingredients (prosciutto/salami salad came without, you guessed it, any meat). The main entrees were the same you could find at any Italian restaurant for a little extra. The service was also okay. Food came at the same time, waiter came around from time to time, but nothing stood out. Didn't seem to care to be there.  The restaurant itself looks very nice and would be a much better environment if it was full. For how much floor space the place had, there were not a lot of people (and it was Father's Day).  UPDATE: Went two more times for family gatherings. Earlier in November I went with a party of 6 and food/service was fantastic. However, returned for Easter and had a large party. Waitress did not seem enthused about working, dishes came out lukewarm. The Owner was more than happy to assist us when we needed it, I just wish the waitress would have showed the same attention. Therefore, it stays at 3 stars."}
{"text":"Where to begin? Comical that they call this Italian....the ONLY good came from the bottle of Casanova di Neri Brunello. This was our 1st time here since they opened 3 months ago, had to ask about bread and once served sun dried tomato hummus was served with it? Hummus? with bread? at an Italian restaurant? We immediately asked for oil & vinegar, thankfully they had that! Calamari is a must when we visit a restaurant for the first time, was shocked when we received the order, I am not kidding you we were served a dish of arugula with 18 pieces of calamari, I actually questioned the server to see if this was indeed an oversight and was told that the order was correct. 3 of us therefore 2 separate entrees, Branzino- no taste whatsoever, Veal Chop? more fat than veal, Linguini Nero? pasta was so overcooked it was pasty had to ask for salt & pepper (not on the table). Not one entrée was finished and when server asked if we wanted to go boxes we just asked for the check and bolted out. Extremely noisy could barely have a conversation. We did have a reservation through Open Table and were seated immediately!"}
{"text":"Where do I start? I've been coming to Spiga Cucina since shortly after they opened. Lunch, Dinner, and special events through work. All have been great experiences with amazing food. Nothing beats their house made pasta except for the service we received from Heather English. Wow...so attentive, without hovering. Exactly what I would expect from a server, but rarely find. She is proficient with the menu and her selection suggestions were right on the mark. My suggestion to you is to try Spiga for the great food, and you'll become a regular if you ask for Heather, as she will guarantee to make your experience just that. An experience worth repeating!!!"}
{"text":"Consistently the best Italian food in town.  Modern yet comfy atmosphere.  Top notch service.  While the menu projects like a high end establishment, the prices are fair and the owner is always present to create a family atmosphere.  Enjoy their happy hour fare for a quick sampling.  I honestly do not have a single favorite menu item but I can safely say that the chefs have a gift for fish.  Stick around for dessert as the owners wife is the pastry chef and dazzles with her Grandmothers Almond Cake and Dolce de Leche."}
{"text":"The four of us enjoyed a Happy Hour at Spiga.  Beautifully decorated and a place you could actually have a conversation without screaming.  Our server was fantastic, attentive and went out of his way to keep us happy.  We had the pizza (chef's choice) which was the pear and gorgonzola.  OMG, that was the best tasting pizza ever.  Two of us shared a Calamari and shrimp salad.  Delicious!  The kitchen even split the order into two plates and did not charge for the service.  Another lady ordered the Chef's selection of meats & cheeses and was equally pleased with her choice.  This has become our favorite place to meet.  We will be back!  We did not venture to the outside seating.  It looked equally inviting with heaters for the winter months."}
{"text":"This review is a bit delayed, but I'll start at the beginning and try to keep it short.  The hubby and I dined for the first time here on Valentine's Day and it was a disaster. The manager reached out to me and asked me to remove my review and they would send us a gift card so we could come back for a \"redo.\" I removed the review and we decided to use our giftcard for our anniversary, which was June 9th.  Unfortunately my husband and I have decided after 2 times of trying Spiga, it just isn't for us. The service is extremely slow. We were there for just over 2 and a half hours the night of our anniversary. We sat inside and it was so loud we could hardly even hear our own conversation. Our server was nice but he was so slow and made it seem as if we were not a priority to him. (This was also an issue we had on Valentine's Day, so thinking it's just a part of dining there?). We had a 7pm reservation, were sat almost immediately and didn't even receive our drinks until 7:27. I actually had to ask if we were going to be getting them. The food was hit and miss. I started with mushroom soup and the flavor was really good. The soup would have been superb had it been hot. I don't really enjoy luke warm soup, and I couldn't bring it to the servers attention because he never came to check on us. For dinner I had the Bucatini Pasta. It was just OK. The smoky flavor was very over powering, almost like they poured liquid smoke into it. I'm sure some people love it, it just wasn't for me. My husband had the Veal Special and enjoyed it, but his side of pasta was cold. It seemed like they plated his pasta before his veal was done and it sat out waiting. Again, we couldn't alert the server because he never once came to check on us. We were just about through eating when he finally appeared. We ended the meal with the Chocolate Truffle Tartufo for dessert; NOW THAT WAS AMAZING!!  All in all, we enjoyed some things and didn't enjoy some others. Unfortunately I think Spiga just isn't for us, there are too many other great places I'd rather spend my money on."}
{"text":"A little expensive, but the pizza has a great crust. Buffalina pizza has a good balance of spice, basil and cheese."}
{"text":"Came here half an hour before close and was greeted by bartender with a smile. We ordered the Beet Ravioli Salad, Meatballs, & Pappardelle Bolognese. Great flavors, nice presentations and perfect portion sizes. Definitely will return. Rare to find such a warm and cozy place with great food and great people. Thank you!"}
{"text":"These heat lamps really work. Don't let them fool you. My veal Piccata was pretty strong but the shrimp tag is a true pass, especially after how strong the waitress sold it. Overall decent not great"}
{"text":"We have had the pleasure of feasting at Spiga several time now and have NEVER been disappointed.  The ambiance, the FOOD and the staff are EXCELLENT ! So good that I'm having my big 60 birthday party in the beautiful private dining room. Picked out a fabulous menu and Fernando the owner was very accommodating and helped me pick out some fabulous wines.  Excellent place to eat great food from Happy Hour to dinner and dessert ! You'll be coming back for more !"}
{"text":"From the friendliness of the staff to the ambiance, this place does it right! Stopped in for a light lunch on Sunday and it was fantastic. Best spaghetti I have had in a long time, and I have travelled up and down the boot of Italy tasting some pretty good pasta. I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Peg and I visited this place for the second time...the first was probably within two weeks of opening last November.  At that time, the food was promising and the service was...um....still developing. Last night, we revisited the place. Not only was the food better than the first time we checked it out, but the service provided by Salvatore was molto bene! His suggestions were good, his attentiveness was spot-on and not tooo much, and the atmosphere was very relaxing. Granted, we went on the earlier side on a Saturday night, but sitting next to an open window with the temp in the high 70s and the view of the valley...was transporting. We sampled the calamari di Sara (a repeat from the first visit), carpaccio, beet \"ravioli\" and the app of the evening which was proscuitto, melon (cantaloupe and honeydew), and fresh mozzarella. We followed this with their salciccia pizza (San Marzano tomatoes..the only thing you need to know is that they are native Italian, actually tasting like a ripe tomato sauce!) sweet italian sausage, fresh grated mozzarella (fior di latte), caramelized onions, and roasted peppers. The crust was wonderfully chewy and oven-baked. The obvious....the espresso and cappuccino were wonderful. As noted, Salvatore made it all happen and the surrounding cast of servers and assistants made the dinner and table memorable. We shall not let another 6 months go by for our return visit! È stato un piacere!! Dr. B"}
{"text":"Food and service was excellent. Unfortunately we were seated next to a table with an ill behaved screaming child."}
{"text":"Food was good. But I'll be honest.. I didn't care for our server. The place is VERY pretty decorated very nice."}
{"text":"I was here by myself back in Nov/Dec and just fell in love with the place.  Great views, service and food.  Invited some neighbors out for dinner last night and they were just as excited even thought it was their initial visit.  Was packed on a Sunday night.  We ate indoor but still sat by the open window and had excellent service and food.  Bar looks inviting and want to come back again to eat outside and try happy hour.  Great find in the area!"}
{"text":"I was part of a party of six for dinner here over the weekend and I must say... The service was terrible. The communication from the server was very limited and we feel that she had poor communication with the chef and the owner. We waited a sad two hours for any food to come to our table and when it arrived, it was the complete wrong order while others around us were enjoying theirs. We got fed up and spoke to the owner. The owner was a little off. Instead of sympathizing with us, he belittled the situation and made us more upset. I hope they fix their service and get their restaurant in order. The least they could have done was offer us an appetizer to hold us over.  I am never going back! We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner down the street at The Lamp. Order The Gem or The Margarita Pizza!"}
{"text":"Hearty portions of perfectly cooked, delicious food in a nice setting with attentive and friendly service at a very reasonable price. The grilled octopus was excellent, as was the seafood linguine. The linguine had generous amounts of tender seafood. Could feed 2 people.  Only two downsides which were related to the facility. There was a fly problem that another review had mentioned. We were periodically swatting them and saw them on the windows. We should have sat away from the windows. We mentioned it to the server, and she said the problem should go away soon because they are now keeping the patio doors closed during the summer and had the exterminator come. I hope so because we really like this restaurant and we plan to come back regularly.  Also, the restrooms were very stuffy and reeked of cleaner.  Nonetheless we had a great experience food and service-wise and are happy to have this gem in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"Nothing special here. The only noteworthy dish was the pasta - but it came out VERY luke warm which defeats the entire purpose of handmade pasta.    Ambience is nice. Service was mediocre. Prices are reasonable.  Try the PARLOR for some of the best pasta in Phoenix. Even Tanzy in Scottsdale quarter gets it right every time with their noodles.  Move right along..."}
{"text":"Loved the prawns dish. It's hard to believe you're in Arizona when you get great seafood like that. Great service and ambience. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"This is the BEST Italian food in Scottsdale! The owner is always there and obviously keeps an eye on quality. Everything is top notch. The portions are amazing, the food quality excellent and prices very reasonable. We love the bartenders and servers too!"}
{"text":"This place is really hit or miss. We've been here about 4 times. Twice the experience was very good the other 2 times we weren't impressed. For the price I think there are better places to try in the area."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place.... first THANK YOU for staying open late as a large group of us over 70 people wanted to come in after an even and after your hours.   Service was amazing, I and 2 of my friends had a couple of bottles of wine, 1 was rose and the other was red (my friend picked it and it was good and I don't recall the name)  My dish was Tagliatelle Gamberi and boy it was delicious, every slurp of that pasta was delicious. I recall our table was engaged in conversations and I was quiet.... busy devouring my dish. My friends ordered a steak and octopus dish that I don't recall their names on the menu but they enjoyed theirs as well.   Service was on point, server and bus staff constantly checked on our drinks and water and food.   Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Just moved to Scottsdale, so we read good reviews and tried Spiga. Our server, David Rachel was one of the best we've ever had. He was very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu and restaurant. The timing for food and drink was great. The food was exceptional. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Let me start out with I just created a Yelp account so I could leave this review. Today is my birthday and we brought a group of 8 people put to eat for dinner. At the end of the dinner the single check comes and we ask to have it split. The waiter says he cannot do that. We have some paying cash and some paying with credit cards and we ask the waiter to take the cash and bring us the remaining check to split up. He brought us back a check that was $100 more than the last check. We ask for manager, the cash back and the original check. We got $20 less than what we originally paid in cash and no manager. At this point it was 20min and we ask for a manager a second time. We wait another 10 minutes and the waiter comes back with the original check but not the $20. The manager comes over finally, offers no apology and then we had to write on the check how to split it up. After another 20min the check comes back and still isn't right. We figured out how to make it work just so we could get out of there. 44 minutes in total we wasted trying to figure this out. Terrible service and terrible management with no attempt to rectify the situation."}
{"text":"Friend recommended this Place and he was right on.  Seafood Combo for two was our entree also had the Spiga Salad Meatball Appetizer.  Kids had pizza and Spaghetti Alfredo  if you haven't been there give it a try.  Sal was a great server"}
{"text":"This is it. This place is the much needed rival to local bistro... That blows local out of the water.   Stunning decor, great vibe, equally stunning and great food. Fair prices too.  Go spiga"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great happy hour. The daily pizza specials are always excellent and never disappoint. $10 bottomless Prosecos on the weekend are awesome as well. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The food is very good, and their service is excellent.  Our server recommended the especial of the day, which was Veal Chop, and it was fantastic!   It is a nice restaurant, but way too noisy. It helps if you get a booth in the smaller room. The other two rooms are way too big and very noisy.  Always make a reservation, as it gets busy early."}
{"text":"Good food good service . Next time sitting in bar area. Busy happy hour. Had the fish of the day,a white fish from Australia on a bed of gnocchi and it was excellent   Partner had veal picatta tasty but a bit chewy. Definitely would come back. Very interesting menu."}
{"text":"I really like the food, presentation, and ambiance. Second time here and can't find a fault. I recommend the Spiga salad, fresh crisp and the combination of flavors were a pleasant surprise. For an entré I had the pork tenderloin which was delicious."}
{"text":"Came here as part of a large group and was seated in the backroad. Two tables of 16 each.   Service started off poorly. The waiter for my table started with the men for drinks and never got around the table for orders. Nine ladies and 7 men. Always start with the women. Always. Not finishing the service was inexcusable.   The hourderves were preselected for the group. Very tasty butterflies tiger shrimp, pickles, peppers, marinated portabellas and more. The mozzarella needed a bit of salt and basaltic but was passable.   I chose the pasta with seafood, unfortunately I do not recall the name of the dish. It was very good. The salmon looked and smelled outstanding. The main course impressed and redeemed the meal.   One serving of tiramisu serves four.   I am sure they handle a small group just fine. If you bring a large group, I would make sure a buster is available for any party over 10.   Overall, slow service and good food.   I would try it again."}
{"text":"What a gem! Stayed at the Fairmont Princess and wanted to go off property for dinner.  Looked at Yelp reviews for Italian cuisine and chose this place.  Great choice by me!! Food and service by Jaclyn was awesome!! Food  selections of shrimp and bolognese was spot on and delicious.  The side of mushroom risotto was so good!  Go to this restaurant - atmosphere and service were impeccable- well worth the$$$ - you deserve it- treat yourself!!"}
{"text":"A welcome, newer biz to north Scottsdale.  Amazing, architecturally interesting venue both inside and out.  An inviting, misted patio.  Great for couples or groups.  Staff is very well trained and accessible.  Talented chef.  Menu is varied and interesting.  Try the house made ravioli!  Extensive wine list.  Reservations recommended."}
{"text":"LOVED SPIGA CUCINA!!!!!!!  Spiga Cucina is possibly one of the best Italian restaurants in the valley. The restaurant itself is beautiful, I can't wait to visit again and sit outside on their patio once Summer 2015 leaves us! Our server was amazing, really helpful, and offered us some amazing recommendations.   We started out with the Calamari di \"sara\", the calamari was coated in a light breading and served with arugula, lemon-caper vinigrette, tomato remoulade. I love it and would def try it again. Next time I am looking forward to trying the Polpo alla griglia which is their grilled octopus, one of the tables next to us ordered it and it looked amazing and they said it was phenomenal.   Entree wise I ordered the linguini nero ( I subbed out the linguini for the pappardelle pasta!)  - it was literally over flowing with shrimp, clams, calamari, scallops with roasted red pepper, tomato, shallot and spicy sugo. for $22.00 it was a steal, I don't think I have ever dined at an establishment that put sooo much seafood in my pasta! I was in Heaven.   I can't totally remember what my dining companions got, but I know they all enjoyed every single bite! So if yours looking for a place that has amazing food and stellar service Spiga Cucina is your spot!"}
{"text":"We had dinner here tonight for the first time. Had high hopes given the investment made in the update from previous place.  Decor is nice.  Wait wasn't bad, but after waiting the 20 minutes quoted they made up a high top in the bar and had us sit there anyways.  Table was very wobbly so manager comes by and has us pick up all our drinks while he attempts to fix the table. Odd for a nice place. We get one glass of wine each and then have to wait for the waiter to have time to check on us again to ask for second.  Foods comes before we get our second glass.  My wife said her's was good, she got the ravioli dish.  I got the pollo parmigiana, came out with burnt edges.  Should have been caught in the kitchen.  Waiter was not attentive at all.  Never checked if everything came out ok or checked back on us before asking if we wanted the bill.  Sorry, usually will give a place two tries but this one loses on round one."}
{"text":"If your plans for relaxing italian meal were important to you, DO NOT come here.  The intense, and I mean intense noise in this restaurant is unbareable.  Our concerns brought the owner to our table, who moved us to a QUIET room.  But to no avail.  It was still 70% as noisy.  You literally had to almost yell to be heard by your table companions.  Since this is a relatively new place, I asked the owner if he had plans to fix the noise issue.  He said yes there were plans.  But it has been open for 10 months already, that is plenty of time if you really intended to fix anything.  Service was excellent no problems there.  Our server was very attentive to our needs.  The food was in general \"good\".  Not exceptional.  The wine list is extensive.  The Caeser Salad was different.  The dressing was unlike any caesar I had ever had.  A pronounced garlic and very lemony acidic flavor and a very thin consistancy.  My Pappardelle Bolognese was very good.  Too bad we could not enjoy eating any of it.  Would I return, absolutely not.  The decor was very well designed, but the intensity of the noise ruins the experience.  What a shame. I added one extra star because of the food.  Good luck to any who venture there.  Bring earplugs and asprin if you do."}
{"text":"I came here last night for dinner and we loved it! We had a few apps and the kale salad as we were grabbing a quick bite before a friends bday. We had the octopus, (it was really good!) the cured salmon (I wish this was presented differently- with a bread and cheese or something- it was flat on a plate with arugula and was our least favorite) , and we had the mussels (loved these). The kale salad was on point as well. Service was great and very friendly- only thing I would add to this place is some music? Strange to me they didn't have anything playing- but that's a quick fix all in all- we will definitely be back to try some entrees!!"}
{"text":"I hear good thing about this place and went for a work dinner.  Service was solid.  My salad good as well.  My wife had the soup again good.  I ordered the Ossobuco again good did need some seasoning. My wife had the fish special Grouper with angle hair best dish of the evening.  I would defiantly order that again."}
{"text":"I was really impressed with this spot when I walked in. It's very modern and VERY big. Loved the outdoor patio, bar area, and other rooms. The service was very good and our server knew the menu really well. I went with my whole family and we all ordered different items including the pork tenderloin, bolognese, veal piccata, the white fish special over gnocchi, and the salmon. While everything we ordered looked amazing it tasted pretty okay. I ordered the salmon. The description sounded delicious almost like an Asian inspired salmon dish I'd never had before. It was crusted in sesame seeds over vegetables with three fingerling potatoes. The salmon was flavorless I think because it was so over cooked, the sesame seeds did nothing to add flavor, but simply sit there like a crust. There was no sauce on the plate, which was incredibly surprising and also disappointing. The potatoes were good, but also didn't add much to the plate. If the potatoes were mashed I think the entree would have been better. Texturally the plate needed something mushy or saucy. If the salmon had been cooked a little less it could have been made it a little tastier as I love the flavor of salmon by itself. All in all enjoyable experience, however for the price you pay it's a little underwhelming."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best Italian restaurants in AZ, it was a bit of a ride but I will drive for excellent food. First the service from hostess to waiters were great, wonderful wine selections also. I started with the Octopus grilled and my wife had the Beet Ravioli, the flavors were fantastic on both. She had the beef short ribs over creamy polenta and I had the Veal Chop cooked to perfection. Dessert was even better, she had the limoncello tartufo and I had the Panna Cotta which was old school delicious. This restaurant is a keeper, the owner Fernando was gracious and great to talk to. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Valentines Day with my sweetheart here was lovely.  I had the sea bass and it was the best I've ever had. Positively divine.  The salad, little bread appetizer and dessert were amazing.  I would have never known how wonderful the food was going to be.  And I especially loved The quantities. Often in a fine dining establishment, they don't give you decent portions. Here they did. Not too much but I was very full and satisfied.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"We had a wonder night with a friend from long ago and experienced a fabulous meal with Vincenzo s our waiter! Great good with great recommendations for food...MMMMM"}
{"text":"To start... the hummus that accompanied the bread was horrid( hummus needs garlic)... the pizza( marguerita) wasn't as good as Peter Piper pizza( NOT a compliment) the salad was boring with a few mozzzarella balls thrown in... the chicken pasta with cream sauce was good ....service was dreadful... beautiful ambience with a gorgeous patio... we wouldn't go back"}
{"text":"Great food, the pasta never fails to disappoint and while it's an Italian place, the burger is actually really good too! Their wine pours are super generous. The patio makes you feel like you're dining in a five star resort somewhere tropical. Only issue we have had is that when dining at lunch the service is really hit or miss. A few times its been great and the last two it's been not good. But the food more than makes up for it."}
{"text":"I had heard good things about this place and was eager to try it.  I arrived at and was seated at  5:55pm.  I asked the hostess if I could still order a happy hour drink.  She said, no happy hour is over at 6.  It was not 6 o'clock yet.  Ok, we are not off to a good start.  After that though, the place did not dissappoint.  We both had the New Zealand white fish and gnocchi special and enjoyed it very much.  (I even took some home for lunch the next day.). The waitress was knowledgeable and helpfull.  The place gets a little noisy however.  Since I live in the Grayhawk area, and this place is convenient, I will probably be back."}
{"text":"Great great restaurant! I loved the atmosphere, the service and the food is simply delicious! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great service!! Great views! NEED TO GET RANCH! What restaurant doesn't have ranch? The food is good. Our bartender Jackoline rocked."}
{"text":"The food was awwwwwwsome!!!  The sangris was even better!!! I would come back and recommend it!"}
{"text":"Spiga is my absolute favorite restaurant! We have been here twice, most recently New Years Eve and everything we have ordered has been beyond amazing. The food is authentic, cooked to perfection and makes us feel like we are eating a homemade meal and not out at a restaurant! Plate presentation is great, larger than average and worth the money. The service is awesome, we've had David both times and he is very knowledgeable. Management is noticeably very involved with serving, cleaning, and stopping by to talk to all their customers. We actually sat next to one of the owners wives our first time in who was even eager to share her own food just because she noticed we were undecided between two items. This restaurant deserves five stars!  Here are some items we've had and definitely will come back for:   Appetizers: Burrata Calamari di Sara Clam Chowder  Entrees: Ravioli di Soraia Tortiglioni Portobello Brasato di manzo  House Special Veal Lobster Ravioli"}
{"text":"I recently received a note from Paula, the owner of Spiga regarding my December review.  She profusely apologized and assured me that the issues I mentioned had all been resolved. We had a lengthy conversation (thank you Paula, for taking the time to really listen!) and she asked me to try Spiga again.  We went there Saturday night with 2 friends and everything was EXCEPTIONAL.  Paula and her husband, Fernando, went above and beyond to ensure that this experience was the absolute BEST it could be.  We all had different entrees, which were perfection, and the service could not have been better!  Fernando made a point of visiting our table more than once to see that all was well.  We were even surprised with a couple of gratis culinary treats from the owners!  We noticed that all the other diners around us were also enjoying their food...lots of \"oohs & ahhs\" around us:)  We sat outside (as it seems most of the other diners did...it was a lovely night) and the ambiance was lovely.  Candlelight, overhead misters, pretty flower beds...what's not to like? Phenomenal comeback Paula & Fernando!  Clearly you take your customers' satisfaction (i.e....the total experience) very seriously.  Bravo!"}
{"text":"Wonderful Italian place that pays attention to detail in the food and ambiance of their restaurant. Started with Barrata that was fresh and homemade. Melted in your mouth as you ate it.  Main dishes were Bucatini all' Amatriciana and a Prosciutto pizza.  The Bucantini has guancuale in it that is like smooth nutter. The sauce is light in flavor and onions soft and it is blended well. The wood fired pizza is a great pizza that has a nice blended flavor that your mouth enjoys. The sauce is refreshing and not over bearing so you enjoy all the other layers.  Very good food and can't wait to come back again soon!"}
{"text":"Came here for my dads birthday and we all really enjoyed it! Good wine list and they had some specialty cocktails as well, my girlfriend enjoyed her martini. Loved the short rib ravioli! Been here twice now and loved some things Ive tried and be \"eh\" about a few, the things that were great though were really great, just need to make my way through and make notes of what I love. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"My parents love spiga and took me there tonight for my first time. Great service, mediocre food. Waitress was AMAZING and very attentive. I can't remember her name, but she was a very pretty, brunette, middle-aged woman. I'm pretty sure she was the bartender. She was very helpful with suggestions on the menu. The restaurant smelled like a bathroom and it threw me off the rest of my time there. I ordered the clams,they tasted funny with the tomato broth. I should've ordered a pizza.. It's pretty much impossible to mess up a pizza. Anyways, great customer service!"}
{"text":"Spiga is our go to restaurant about once per week.  The Barramundi special is fabulous.  Great Sazeracs, also.  Great comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"Aaaaaamazing food, David L our waiter was awesome, restaurant feel was on point, lastly the owner Fernando came out to greet us and asked about our dinner. If I could give 6 stars I would have. Will be back for sure. New favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"This place was  absolutely  fabulous.  Great Service,  great ambiance,  and amazingly  tasty food. It's brand new. I believe  it has opened  couple  of months ago, but  it was  already  so crowded, even though  it's  pretty large. Anyway,  it was  a great  experience. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic dining experience! This evening we were immediately greeted and seated in the dining room, and from there the food, service, ambiance was excellent! If you're a fan of seafood, my wife had the grigliata di pesce and loved it. I enjoyed a kale salad followed by a perfectly seasoned and grilled NY Strip steak.  We also appreciated Heather's friendly, attentive service as well. Fernando and his wife (the owners) put their heart and soul into the restaurant, and it shows.  Thanks Spiga!"}
{"text":"One of the best places to eat in the area. Food and service are always top tier."}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant! Enjoyed the atmosphere and the delicious food, with excellent service. I would go back. This is a must try. Can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Generous portions."}
{"text":"The food is really great here.... Homemade pasta is fantastic ....and the dishes well priced and portioned. But I really think they need to get a handle on their service... I never waited over an hour to get an entree before and the wait staff appeared very chaotic ... They practically were running into each other! Very unsettling when we were already getting heated that our food was taking SO LONG! They really have a gem on their hands .... But the wait staff is going to be this restaurants downfall!!!"}
{"text":"Always a lover of Italian food I was excited to try this place out. It recently opened a few months ago and it still has a few kinks to work out but overall my experience was good. Nice atmosphere and decor too.   I started with a reservation (which I would highly recommend) but my party ended up at a table in the bar area. When I called into the restaurant and spoke to the hostess she mentioned the dining room can get noisy and that is true. The tables in the bar area are inviting and not as noisy. The attractive thing here is there is also seating available outside and lots of it!  Outside seating is covered with a roof but open on three sides. It's a nice option and would be my preference if temps are warm.  Our server was attentive at the beginning of the evening but then became almost \"annoying\" as the night went on. He seemed to go into much...too much...detail about the menu and we all felt as if he was almost \"selling\" certain items. It seemed (even though) there were a lot of staff they could have used more. We were done with dinner for quite some time before anyone cleared our plates.  We all ordered different types of pasta and everyone was delighted with their dish. Prices seemed reasonable and proportions were large. Homemade hummus with carrots and peas is served with homemade bread. Delicious! I would say 4 stars for food.   Even though service wasn't perfect on our first visit I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"We went here for a large business dinner and not only was the service outstanding but the food was delicious. We got an appetizer platter that was mixed with several items, i.e. burrata, shrimp, different cuts of meat, hummus, bread, etc. Everyone was commenting that this was one of the best appetizer platters they've had. Then we had the mushroom risotto and the salmon which were both excellent. We sat outside on the covered patio too which created a nice ambience. Definitely a great dining experience."}
{"text":"Great lunch at Spiga today. During a work conference we had the privilege of celebrating a coworkers 30 year work anniversary. We had a party of 28 people. The service was exceptional and fast. The food was delicious. The staff was very attentive and the entire group had a fantastic time.   The meals were reasonably priced and I highly recommend this fantastic restaurant."}
{"text":"We arrived 45 min earlier than our reservation and we were seated right away that pleased us. We found the food and service to be very comparable  to other Italian restaurants in the valley but we were extremely displeased the Acoustics are terrible.  outside was loud that's to be expected bar area loud that's to be expected but the main dining room I couldn't not here my husband across the table or the lady sitting next to me very very bad acoustics.  I cannot say that I won't return but I'm not  happy for the dollar amount that I could not have conversation with my guests."}
{"text":"Their success has resulted in terrible service they're consistently overwhelmed and understaffed !"}
{"text":"My problem is the service.  I was there last Friday with 4 people.  The server was in such a rush he wouldn't wait for me to finish asking questions before leaving, like, \"What is the pizza of the day and the bruschetta of the day,\" etc as they were not on the menu.  When he said the pizza, I said to my friends, \"that sounds good...\"  He took that as place an order... So the problem came when he came to take our order, that he already made the pizza which was for 2 of us and the other 2 ordered something else... So we said, \"please hold the pizza so we can eat together.\"  He said, \"ok, no problem...\"  Not one minute later the pizza comes...  The 2 people ate it while it was hot, then when our meals arrived almost 15 minutes later, my order was completely wrong. (Multiple issues including a food allergy.)  So now my wife ate without me so hers wouldn't get cold-- you see the point, all 4 of us ate a different times.  Now, I was also in a bit of a rush to leave because I had to get to work and the others were not going home.   The server apologized for the confusion and offered a free desert. I said, \"Thats very nice, but being allergic to dairy, I really cant eat any of them, and, I also don't have time so no worries.\"  He then said he was sending the owner over to talk to us.    Now, really, I dont need anyone to talk to me.  In this situation the right thing to do is to comp part of the meal and move on... So, I asked for the check and then a manager comes over and says, \"I heard there was some trouble?\"  Which is uncomfortable. Don't make me tell the story, you should be aware what happened and simply say, \"we're sorry there were some problems, we're gonna take care of the pizza for you,\" or whatever.  So I say, \"just timing issues and an order wrong, it happens...\"  Again this guy says, \"Well let me offer you a desert...\" and AGAIN, I have to say, \"Thank you, but no thanks I cant eat it any we cant take it with us.\"  He says, \"Ok, well I am going to talk to the owner...\"  Which left me wondering, why? Its not a big deal...  The bill comes.  They took nothing off.  I never asked for a manager, or the owner, but they kept insisting which set my expectation that they would take one of the items off the bill... Then of course he brings a bag with two deserts in it.  L.O.L.  I gave the deserts to a family with two little kids at a different table and I left a shitty tip, for which I now feel bad because I have worked as a server myself, but I mean come on...  The problem is, this is the Scottsdale flavor of the month and they are extremely busy, but, as summer comes and its just us locals left, I hope they will work on slowing down and making sure things are right, this was my second visit and on the first visit, they got my order and my wife's order wrong in addition to serving an extremely warm bottle of wine."}
{"text":"Tried this place recently for a lunch with friends and have to say that, unfortunately, it simply didn't live up to the hype.   Ambiance is pretty nice, they certainly have their upscale vibe with the centrally located wine racks, brick ceiling, dark wood tables, leather chairs and modest lighting. First impression was certainly good, based solely on the high end and professional appearance of the restaurant itself.   Alas, as I often say, you can't eat ambiance, nor does it fill your drink, so the rating mostly comes down to the food and service. In my view, both were lacking. Our server wasn't terribly friendly, to put it nicely. Sorry to say, but if you have resting bitch face, you could at least try to smile now and then. While I could stomach service without a smile if the service was at least good, in this case it fell short. My drink was empty far too often and for far too long. More than once, refill was promised but never came. That's high on my short list of unforgivable restaurant sins, especially given that the place was half empty at the time.  The food, while good, was nowhere near as good as the hype would lead you to believe. As far as appetizers, the croquets were, in my opinion, dry and lacked flavor. The meatballs had flavor, but not much, and were only lukewarm. When it comes to the entrees, my pasta bolognese was perfectly cooked, but both the pasta and the sauce, again, lacked strong flavor. I've gotten stronger flavor out of a jar of store bought meat sauce and boxed noodles, and that's not an exaggeration.   Last but definitely not least, I have to mention the flies. I don't know what it was, but there were quite a few flies buzzing around our table and those nearby. It was very unappetizing having them land on our hands, heads, plates and drinks, constantly. Nobody did anything about it, and it went on for the entire meal until we left. Were it not for this, I'd have added a star, but it grossed me out.   As the rating says, I've experienced better. Much better, and without the flies. I don't recommend it, at least not for pasta dishes and not if you expect service with a smile."}
{"text":"GREAT new restaurant!  I ate there last night with a large group, and we were all extremely happy with everything we ate.  Highlights for me were (in order of the meal) 1) hummus and bread.  I am very picky about hummus, and this was delicious--very creamy and flavorful. 2) the lamb...oh my God, the lamb!!  I usually don't like lamb because the flavor is too gamey, but I was fortunate enough to get a bite of it last night, and it was one of the best meat dishes I've had in a while. 3) the bolognese--I'm a sucker for homemade pasta, and this was no exception.  Noodles were perfect, and there was plenty of the delicious sauce on top of it.  And the huge spoonful of, I think, ricotta on top made it even better.  The table kept passing it around. 4) the short rib--tender, flavorful, and I could've eaten an entire plate of the polenta that it came with.  My fiancé said it was the best polenta he'd ever eaten, and he all but licked the plate. 5) the pizza--we had one with spicy salami and another sweet one with fig.  They were both great!  Sometimes brick oven pizza disappoints me, but this was the perfect balance of crust and toppings.  Nothing overtook the rest of the components.  6) the creme brûlée--this is my go-to dessert, and I was not disappointed!    In addition to the food being wonderful, the service was stellar.  It was opening night, so they ran a little behind at times, but that is to be expected.  Our server was great about making sure we had full glasses and letting us know when our food was coming out, and, most importantly, she was friendly and knowledgable.  Finally, I loved the decor--very open, brick, wood, and awesome light fixtures.  It's upscale but casual--very welcoming!  We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"This lively and classy place makes every patron feel special. Bartenders are best in the valley and clearly understand what service is. They acknowledge you as soon as you walk in with a smile even when they are busy.  Other area bars should send their staff here to see what professional bartenders are all about.  Great  food at a fair price makes this a must visit. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"We don't go out for Italian food very often... My husband is a chef, he is Italian and makes his own pasta. Between him and his mother there is usually no need. But every once in a while, we'd like to enjoy great Italian food out... Nice to have a place nearby that has excellent food. The only complaint was that the seafood in the Negro Mare was a bit skimpy.  However, I almost went to 3 stars for lack of a children's menu... Our kids can order off any menu and loved their dishes but at $25 each (with lemonade & a gelato) for kids under age 6 is ridiculous! Also, the service was just the other side of leisurely....Poured our own wine at one point.  We'll be back, but hope they will consider stepping up the pace just a bit and being more accommodating to families. Great vibe, great patio (no view, but looked lovely) and great food."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant with a nice outdoor dining area. There is also a private dining area as well. I had the bolognese and it was fantastic. My kids had pizza and raved about that as well."}
{"text":"I wrote a rather critical review of this restaurant very close to our home shortly after it opened, due to lacklustre food and poor service.  I am delighted to report that the restaurant seems now to have hit its stride, and is now on a par with our favorite \"Local Bistro\" as a go-to neighborhood restaurant.  We dined outside under the heaters during the very busy Barrett Jackson week, with every table filled. (I'm sure that it would have been very noisy inside.)  Despite how busy the restaurant was, the service was first class, with multiple refills of water from the (free) bottle on the table.  I ordered the whole Branzino fish ($26), which was perfectly cooked and very tasty.  My wife shared the large short-rib plate with one of our friends. The wine list is large, with some good choices in the low-to-mid-$40 range."}
{"text":"Everyone's dessert was fantastic, especially the tiramisu.  The fish was good with the exception of the plate being drenched in olive oil, including everything on it (very oily). Salad was decent."}
{"text":"Great new local Italian spot in the neighborhood. We really enjoyed our dinner and the place looks great! We are giving them a -1 star for the service which was good but pretty slow. It's only their second day being open so I'm sure it will get better. Anyhow, the food and drinks were great. We shared the grilled octopus, the caprese 3 way, and the bolognese and finished with the chocolate dessert. Very yummy and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Ate dinner here for a work function and we had a pre-selected menu and based on what was preselected I was as a huge fan. We started with the best Charcuterie trays I have had. They had fresh grilled Tiger Prawns (apparently they come from Rocky Point daily), a great Burrata, Grilled Artichokes, Smoked Salmon, cured meats and tomatoes and Mozzarella.   We also got the Bologna's Pappardelle and Mushroom Risotto prior to our Entrees. Both were great. I had the 12oz Sirloin which they cooked to a perfect Medium Rare. The accompanying asparagus and fingerling potatoes were also good.   The meal was capped of by possibly the best Tiramisu I have had. The flavor was fantastic!"}
{"text":"We started out with several Italian appetizers like meatballs, bruschetta, calamari and they were great. We then had the polpo alla griglia, which was outstanding!! Wonderful spiciness of the sauce and mellow tartness of castelvetrano olives (I think) - paired with the La Meirana Gavi. I could have eaten just this for dinner, but there was more to come. The fileto de manza with the brandy cream reduction was amazing especially with the 2013 Alves de Sousa Douro Rsv. Thank you Chef, and your staff for a memorable evening."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews we were really looking forward to this place. Things started out well with a nice atmosphere and pleasant waitress. We placed our order and then waited and waited and waited. The waitress told us the kitchen was behind and they would be giving us free desserts before the meal even arrived. The entrees overall were good, my veal was not very tender and arrived a bit cool in temperature. We did try a dessert but had already planned on gelato after dinner so for us this really was not a compensation for the dinner wait time. Based on this experience i would not return."}
{"text":"Just finished dinner at Spiga. It was really good. Service was top notch and the food was truly exceptional. So many truly great options and done so well. I had had Liguini nero; it was excellent. Only criticism is the menu description fell a bit short on explaining the dish. It was a bit like a Bouillabaisse with black linguini. None-the-less, I enjoyed it immensely.  The biggest positive... prices were really good. Value is definitely there. I left thinking that I wanted to do a nice review and mention the value, but a bit concerned thay management might read the review and raise prices. I've decided to write the review anyway, hoping that it doesn't affect the pricing.   I'll will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Spiga is the best restaurant in town! Not only is it family-owned, they treat all their costumers like family. High-quality food, amazing service, tasty drinks, and a whole lot of fun are just a few things you'll get at this place! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"On Saturday we took a dear friend to Spiga as a \"special\" treat as he had come from out-of-town to visit for a significant birthday celebration. So, important occasion! There were three of us. We decided on Spiga because we had experience there...lovely setting, good food, fun ambiance, etc.etc. The place was hopping when we came in. Lots of folks out for a Saturday night. So, business is good! Our waiter, Wade, was efficient at first, but clearly under stress. Actually, all the wait staff seemed stressed, bustling about joylessly. Some of the earlier diners had left and the next turn was being seated one table after another. Our drinks arrived. After ordering we waited for a very long time before we saw anyone again. Very Long Time. Must've been at least 30 minutes!  We noticed people who were sat after us getting their food...never a good feeling...we finally flagged down our flying waiter, Wade. We asked \"what's up with our dinner?\" and he said he \"will check on it.\" When we asked what the problem was, he mumbled an apology and said \"I'll make it up to you.\" Keep in mind, we simply ordered pasta and one chicken parm!! After that, his contact with us was limited, swift and impersonal...no eye contact whatsoever. When the food finally arrived, no one offered us grated cheese or red pepper or any pepper or any more wine for our empty glasses....or Anything!! We had to again, track someone down and ask for it! Just felt so not cared for! Like they were just dumping the food on us and running! Food was good, however the terrible service spoiled our evening. All this would have been enough of a bummer, except what happened afterwards. We got our bill, expecting an accommodation for the poor service, comped drinks or something...NOTHING! Gets worse... when we caught sight of the owners wife, we called her over to our table and gave her the laundry list of our bad experiences at her restaurant...some owners appreciate the feedback!! ...absolutely NO apologies...just a lot of excuses...no effort to \"make it right\" or try to win back our business, as we clearly were the definition of an \"unhappy customer.\" Especially since before that evening, we were returning guests of this establishment and had watched them grow and supported them in the process! Having been in business ourselves, we know that moments like these are opportunities for business owners to really turn the situation around and make the unhappy customer theirs \"for life' by going the extra mile to do the right thing...apologize, take responsibility, offer us a return incentive such as a free round or dessert or anything! She was clearly not in that camp. We felt like she was cutting us loose and didn't care because she had all these other diners who could take our place and \"so what!\" For us, it was an insult.  And so, we will NEVER be back there...despite the food and the pretty place...when you have a proprietor who cares not for the customer who comes in for a dining experience and is not well served because \"we don't count,\" it leaves a bitter taste in one's mouth!"}
{"text":"This is an accidental review. I have never been to this establishment but don't know how to remove this review."}
{"text":"Wow, what can I say...thought I was just going to a neighborhood restaurant but was really taken back by the decor and how busy they were for a Wednesday night.  This is a word of mouth local hot spot anyone in the area will appreciate.  The special of the night was Sea Bass...at an Italian place???  Hmmm...well the waiter said I would not be disappointed and I have to say it was a close runner up to Eddie V's Sea Bass and about 1/2 the price.  I think this is the best new cafe in North Scottsdale and has the feel of a 5 star restaurant without the high price tag.  Great place to din outdoors for you out of state snow birds as well.  As a local Realtor I will recommend to my out of state clients looking for the local hot spot and not a chain restaurant they can eat at anywhere.  The owner is from Canada and now resides here and was great at checking with all his guest about their experience...It's nice to have someone who truly cares about your feedback.  This is a phenomenal spot for us to have in North Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I love this place!  The atmosphere is pretty!  Love the bar!!!  Pretty sunset spot!  Food is Delish!!  Neighborhood place for me...must try!!"}
{"text":"Having spent many a happy hour and dinner time at this location when it was Joe's, we anxiously awaited the remodel and new opening. They did a great job of opening up the inside and the patio is a super nice environment for eating outside (despite the motorcycle noise on the street). The place was full with people giving it a try and time will tell if the crowds continue to flock. Having been in food i know the need to build \"activity and excitement\" in a place so it doesn't seem like a morgue with classical music however.... with so many hard surfaces in this place (walls, floors, ceiling, tables, etc.), the noise level almost made it impossible to hear someone 3 feet across the table. Think about some softer items somewhere. Even in Italy they hang tapestries.   As my companion said, \"nothing to make me really want to come back.\"  Let's face it, there are more Mexican and Italian places around than you could eat at in a year, so there's got to be something special to make you revisit other than location. I was disappointed enough to have the same feeling after such anticipation.  First, I hate when restaurants are so pretentious as to bring out your \"portion\" of wine in a small carafe and pour it into a large glass (that seems the size of a football next to the portion) hoping you'll be impressed with their effort to dirty another container on your behalf. Sorry, just pour a nice glass of wine and bring it out. And it really does makes the portion look small. I'd rather have the wine than the experience. OK, it's a personal thing.  Second, as a test of new places, especially Italian, I try the Caesar salad. Not sure why but it's always been an indication. Well... Disappointment Central. I hate sending things back but there was as much taste as one might find chewing on their gym socks - maybe less. If there was any garlic at all, it's only cause it was walked through a room with garlic on a counter. You can usually taste the tang of the lemon juice...not to be found. It was a real disaster and I'm sure the creator is spinning in his grave somewhere in San Diego. If you like Caesar salads... I'd pass on this one.  Next, I wanted to try something different so I jumped on the Short Rib Ravioli. I'm always up for something new but maybe good short rib meat shouldn't be chopped, mushed and pureed. For some reason, the taste and texture belonged in a old age facility for people with no teeth. OK, I like my meat with texture and chunks. I guess the other thing was that the very rich beef stock sauce combined with the filling was really overwhelming. It would have been great over a nice charred steak with mushrooms and onions but on delicate pasta? Not so much. I've had great sauces and unique items and fillings at some terrific places but sometimes it just doesn't fit. Move on.  And overall, the waiter must have been extremely new (like 5 minutes?) as his attention to guests and quick, relaxed knowledge of things wasn't there. We deliberately waited a bit before showing up here so as not to get caught in the grand opening fray and to let things settle in a bit. Staff training is PARAMOUNT in a place of this projected level.  My last thought is about pricing. Italian and Mexican food places can be among the most profitable. After all, their menus are mainly based on less expensive commodities of rice, beans and flour. I was hoping this was a nice normal affordable place to sit and eat and enjoy some quality yet casual Italian love from the kitchen in a nice friendly neighborhood eatery. We didn't want to pay over $75 or $100 to do it. OK, they have to recoup the money put into very nice wall coverings and lighting and it is a nice atmosphere but... don't do it all on my check.  I never want to be unkind and maybe I should cut the owners some slack but hey... this isn't their first place so experience should count for something. Anyhow, with all that said, it might be worth a return visit to try their pizza which comes out of a nice looking wood burning oven. i'll update later as the motivation strikes me to repeat.   Just keeping it real!  And get rid of those little carafes."}
{"text":"I would highly recommend the new Spiga. I have been several times now and everything has been great. They did a beautiful job on the remodel. The decor is classy and comfortable. I have had several items on the menu and everything has been exceptional. The pizzas are great, appetizers are awesome, and the house wine is great! The prices are reasonable and portions are large. And I am a huge fan of the Happy Hour! Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Amazing - creative, well-prepared Italian food with the freshest ingredients. And they are always consistently good!  Love love love the burratas, the fresh and creative seafood dishes, and all their pastas are home made. Chicken with sundried tomatoes and roasted red pepper is a fav. They are our go-to place in North Scottsdale."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!!! SO SO happy a great Italian Resturant is near me!!! Been there a handful of time NEVER have been the slightest disappointed.  FOOD: AMAZING and fresh SERVICE: PERFECT FRIENDLY  BEAUTIFULLY DONE INSIDE Classy as it gets. Perfect ambiance and can't wait to sit on that patio!! Might go tonight defiantly in the next couple days. Been there 5 times in two weeks lol.   Got to give praise when praise is due. They know how to treat people and food perfectly. Mangia Mangia!!!"}
{"text":"I returned.  The pasta is still gummy and stuck together, but the Bolognese  Was much better.   It actually needed cracked red pepper to make it flavorful.  Our waiter was great.  If they could figure out how to boil pasta this might be a great place."}
{"text":"Some pretty good food here, although smaller portions. Their wine selection and service is where it is at, like they have a TON of different wines so this is a great date spot. The price can be a bit pricey."}
{"text":"Another fantastic meal.  We love our waiter, Frank.  Be sure to ask for him and you will leave feeling like a celebrity.  Excellent food, great service and fantastic owners.  We love Fernando and Paula and appreciate their attention to every detail.  So thankful to have Spiga in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Went to Happy Hour and very impressed!  The bartenders are attentive and friendly.  Great wine on happy hour menu!  Had the meatballs and they were delicious!  Split the Bolognese with hubby and it was very good!  Nice ambience - would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"The. Best. Octopus. Ever.   From beginning to end everything about this place surprised and delighted us. Searching for a tasty Italian place near our hotel on Open Table, we found this unassuming gem. Nice design and located in a business complex rather than the strip malls, it has an awesome patio with misters and comfy furniture. We ate inside with Alex who was a knowledgeable and accommodating server. The wine list is beautifully curated and (take note management) dramatically under priced, with perfect parings for Italian cuisine. From our first bites to our last, everything we tried was well beyond expectation. The most insanely tender, flavorful and creative octopus appetizer, perfectly cooked pasta with hearty bolognese, and even a gluten free pasta substitution option.   We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Spiga Cucina is definitely one of the best restaurants I've been to in a long time. Pleasant service, amazing decor and scenic view. I had an appetizer for lunch Gamberi Limone - Jumbo shrimp, crushed tomato, garlic, lemon, shallot, sherry & Tuscan butter served with fire grilled sliced bread... it tastes just as delicious as it sounds! Great selection of wine on display and an oven that can fire up a delectable pizza!  If I weren't watching my weight ... that creme brulee would have had me at hello! If you were thinking about pizza, calamari, salad or pasta, this is the place to enlighten your savory senses!"}
{"text":"The service was less that I expected. We lost the server 1/2 way through the meal. We  did not get offered salad, a refill on beverage or dessert. Had to ask for check. Manager did apologize and picked up appetizer and wine for lack of service. The food was good, so we will give them another chance"}
{"text":"Delicious. Delicious.  Well decorated Italian restaurant with excellent service and exquisite entrees."}
{"text":"Terrific menu, very nice space, attentive service.  We had the Caprese Three Ways, Prosciutto and Mushroom pizza, Pappardelle Bolognese, and Beet Ravioli.  With the exception of the beets which was just okay, it was all excellent. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"My friend and I were last week and we loved it! Great cocktails and a nice wine list. Had the calamari and would def recommend! Their bread they bring out is delicious too. Will def be back! Sit outside on the patio if the weather allows :)   Ps. Loved the music"}
{"text":"Stopped in on April 7 with my wife and two kids for a light dinner.  My wife and I enjoyed our Spiga salads and the classic Italian pizza we split.  Both kids split a kid-friendly cheese pizza that was out with minutes of us ordering.  Sat at a high top table in the bar.  Enjoyed one of their good selection of amaro after dinner."}
{"text":"Visited for the first time a few weeks ago, after driving by constantly and dying to finally go, we finally made it in! The atmosphere is great! Hip and beautiful outdoor area, cool and lively bar. Our food was DELICIOUS! It was busy but not BUSY busy so the service wasn't amazing but I won't let that stop me from returning. Already recommended to friends."}
{"text":"This Italian place was good! I certainly did not expect the artichoke dip to look like it did, but I was still delicious. The pasta w/chicken was very good. The moscato was yummy, sure hit the spot. I do think the space between the tables out on the balcony is a tad tight, but overall I am glad we tried this place."}
{"text":"I must say that they did a beautiful job with the space, especially the lovely patio. Went there for the first time yesterday to have lunch and had the pappardelle bolognese - While the dish was good, I expected the sauce to be somewhat richer in flavor. My friend had the bufaleta pizza and it was wonderful. The cappuccinos were wonderful. The owner Fernando is very friendly and welcoming. I wish them a lot of success. Our server Marcus was very kind and attentive. I look forward to try some of the other items on the menu. Their wine list is extensive"}
{"text":"Absolutely love the service and all the dishes we had. One of the best salmon dishes I have ever had.Pasta was delcious great sample of all the seafood. Appetizer was amazing the sauce that was served with the shrimp and bread is my favorite!   If I am ever in Scottsdale I will be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing!! Excellent food, but in a world where customer service is non existent- this place is incredible."}
{"text":"First let me say since this was the first time I went to this location after the renovation. I was thoroughly impressed with the decor and ambiance. Unfortunately that was about all I was impressed with. If you are going to pay 12 dollars for 3 tiny meatballs you at least want good service. I asked for bread, it never came. I ordered the pork ravioli expecting my pallet to be delighted with the veal jus. It was terrible, I believe it might have been premade. My girlfriends risotto was horrible as well, with so much cheese you could hardly taste the mushrooms. Everything was incredibly overpriced for the quality. I wouldn't go back to this restaurant if they sent me a free 100 dollar giftcard. My stomache gets upset just thinking about going back. If you are urban spooning local restaurants to try something new, avoid this one in my opinion there are plenty of better Italian restaurants in the area for the price."}
{"text":"Awesome waitress. Made a reservation, was taken to the table right on the dot. The place was a bit too loud but I guess that just means everyone was enjoying their experience. Food was delicious. A bit overpriced for chicken parmigiana in my opinion. Kids pizza was huge but tasty. The tiramisu was phenomenal. Happy with the shrimp pasta, tasted like a healthy choice. Halibut on risotto was fantastic. Short ribs were cooked perfectly. And the bread... well the garlic spread they have is very yummy. Thank you for a great birthday dinner with my family!"}
{"text":"Quite pleased. Thank you, again, Yelpers for a correct call-out!  Arrived during the Phoenix Open to a packed house. Quoted 20-30 minute wait. Seated by the owner's daughter about 20 minutes in. Well done.  Server greeted us promptly. Adriana. Bread with an olive paste served fairly soon after. Nice flavors. Drink orders - non-alcoholic - took a while. They have a very heavily flavored iced tea which was way too strong. The water was cold and free flowing.  Entree orders took a very long time to get ordered. Once ordered, the kitchen time was reasonable. Ravioli Di \"Soraia\" was wonderfully prepared and had amazing flavors between the herb cheese and the mushrooms. Too much salt on the carrot garnish so I just pushed that to the side. Pollo Parmigiana was recommended to us by the owner's daughter. Good pick. Very different. No heavy tomato sauce. Just a really well cooked, lightly breaded tender chicken filet topped with melted parm. Very generous portion.  A diner next to us had the Linguini Nero which gets its color from, if I recall the recommendation for the owner's daughter correctly, squid ink. Too adventurous for me but the woman raved about it.  Dessert - yes Adriana suggested it (read my other reviews)! - was a delicious creme brulee and a chocolate torta of sorts. Can't recall it's name. Zabaione wrapped with chocolate gelato and rolled in cocoa powder. Oh my!  We were told the place was busier than normal. It was packed with people still waiting to be seated after 9:30 p.m. This place is noisy! If it's a date night, better hope your date approves that you'll both have to lean in close over the table to hear each other!"}
{"text":"After a good first experience mid-week,  our return visit was a disappointment on a Friday night. Although they accommodated us as we arrived early, the table was by the door and every time it opened we got a blast of cold air. The waiter was proficient, but it took over an hour for the entrees to arrive after ordering. Then my veal chop arrived basically raw when I asked for medium. It eventually arrived after the rest of our party were done their meals. A free desert was provided to try and make up for the gaff, but the overall experience was far from adequate."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner. Great food, atmosphere, and service. Highly recommend this restuarant. Want to go back for Happy Hour too."}
{"text":"Have been twice since it opened, and was impressed both times - especially for a newly opened restaurant. The place was packed both times, whereas the previous restaurant never was. The ambiance and decor are impressive, though it's a little loud. They have a nice looking patio, but I haven't sat there. The menu is quite varied with both traditional and unique choices, though it's a tad bit more expensive than I like for an everyday dinner - but not excessive. They've really done a fantastic job with the place!  We coincidentally got the same waiter on both visits, Marcus, who is great! Attentive, knowledgeable and helpful, with a great smile.  I hope they continue to do well and become a fixture in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Fantastic !!!  It's great to finally have amazing Italian food in North Scottsdale. Very relaxed inviting environment. Clean and beautiful inside. Staff are all friendly and provide great customer service... Especially the bartenders.   Make sure you sit at the bar and take advantage of the great view. Start off with the Meatballs and Polenta, so good. There Sangria goes well with this too. We also had the Chefs Special Pizza, there's a different pizza everyday, witch happened to be pepperoni and mushrooms. Nothing to fancy but what sets this pizza apart from others is the awesome fresh dough. You can absolutely taste the difference. Also try the Panzanela salad with chicken. The fresh mozzarella in the salad is amazing. This place is great for family's or a romantic night out.  Happy hour is great to !!!"}
{"text":"For the person from Spiga who commented below and scolded me for my review:   It's not okay for your guests to be at your restaurant for 2 hours and leave without one of them eating dinner because you never know where your batch of meat is coming from. While we appreciated the apology, that was not enough. Next time this happens to another guest, my suggestion would be to comp their wine or invite them to come back to dine with dinner on you.  While I can appreciate that your hostesses are new and in training, that is not our problem. Make it right next time. An apology was not enough in this case since poor service is a reoccurring theme at your restaurant (you can read about it in others' reviews too) and especially since we were loyal customers sending people your way. Shame on you for not being able to handle some constructive criticism.  I have every right to review your restaurant. Please make the necessary changes so that you can provide good customer service to your guests. I wish the best for you.   It went from bad to worse. Very poor customer service. We have tried to love this place because we live in the neighborhood and my husband works right in the same area. The service is always really slow but the food has mostly been good so we kept on frequenting the place in hopes that they would improve with the service. I actually YELPED this establishment a year ago because a server told us that she would not give us good service since we were sitting on the patio and it was too hot out there and she didn't want to walk out there too often. She encouraged us to sit inside. I took my review down because we really wanted this place to work out and because my husband liked the owner, I wanted to cut him a break.   Sadly tonight was the last straw for us. We checked in. We had a reservation for a table on the patio and the hostess let us know that she missed my request. (The only place to sit is on the patio-the rest of the restaurant looks and feels like a cafeteria). The owner (who my husband knows through his business) said he would get us seated as soon as possible. He didn't follow up with us. My husband kept checking in with the hostess.  We waited at the bar for 40 minutes. We finally got seated and I ordered a steak medium rare  and it was extremely rare (Purple) and my potatoes were ice cold. I sent it back and it came back like rubber so I just asked them to take it away. The owner only had excuses for us. His hostesses are new and they make lots of mistakes, the meat comes in different batches and you never know what you will get. Wow. So we have eaten there probably 50 times  and my husband's business has paid thousands in gift cards for his clients. Seriously, at the least, comp our $20 worth of prosecco that we only ordered because we had to sit at the bar and wait for our res that their hostesses clearly messed up. I hope in the future that the owner uses his actions instead of his words to make up for any mistakes made by his staff."}
{"text":"The calamari salad(di sara) is amazing.  My husband and I even tried to get the recipe for the vinaigrette they use on it.  It's that good.  Although it's pricey, it's well worth the splurge every once in a while to get a delicious meal that tastes fresh.  Usually we pick it up to go, but the few times we have eaten there the staff was friendly and the service was pretty good."}
{"text":"First time here, we waited over an hour to order our meals. There was also a VERY loud table that they kept feeding drinks to. After 2 couples left because of the noise more drinks were served. Then someone asked them to be quite again and a FIGHT broke out. Wow! Once we recieved our food it was ok. Will not be  coming back."}
{"text":"The food and service were great. But the experience was unpleasant. The four of us spent the meal in mostly silence; when we tried yelling at each other over the noise we still couldn't communicate. I also didn't enjoy spending time standing in line at the bathroom. It is a crowded, loud place and there are only two stalls in the ladies' room.  If I had read the review containing the owner's rude reply to a customer complaint prior to dinner, I would have chosen a different place. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Great night! Great time!  Finally a restaurant that has learned how to take care of customers.  The owner said hello and checked on us, thanks Fernando!  Our waiter was perfect. Thanks Dave, enjoy Europe, and be safe.  Perfect timing on every part of the meal.  Will be back for sure!!    See ya next week,  Phil S."}
{"text":"This was our second visit to Spiga.  We were very impressed the first time and had an excellent meal.  This time, it was restaurant week and we ordered off the special menu with hit and miss results.   For appetizers, I ordered the gnocchi and Hubs got the salad.  The gnocchi was just ok but drowning an a heavy, bland bolognese sauce.  It was supposed to have been tossed in a Parmesan wheel, and we did see them doing this, but there was no flavor infused in this process.  Also it came to my table cold.  The kale salad on the other hand was very good.     For entrees, I had the lamb and Hubs ordered the sea bass.  This time the lamb was excellent, cooked to perfection and juicy, with a wonderful truffle polenta.  The sea bass on the other hand came out a bit overcooked and dry, and the sweet pea risotto was very bland - tasted like rice and peas boiled in just water, no seasoning or creaminess.  Also the corn sauce served under it was ice cold.   Dessert choices were limited - creme brulee or panna cotta (both vanilla).  Meh to both, but the panna cotta also had a strange texture - more yogurt-y than pudding-y.   So, while we were disappointed this time, we will go back based off our first experience, and also seeing all the better looking regular menu entrees going out that night."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS NEW PLACE! They only opened a few weeks ago and my coworkers and I have already stopped in went twice in one week. Excellent fish specials and the wood fired pizza is AMAZING! Italian style pizzas, melt in your mouth. Great hand tossed dough and delicious cheese. Very nice wine selection. Can't wait to come back and try other items! The atmosphere is very hip too...rustic contemporary style. Very clean. A must try!"}
{"text":"I've lived in N. Scottsdale for over 12 years and Spiga Cucina is by far my favorite restaurant in the valley.  The beautiful decor, fun vibe, incredible meals and OUTSTANDING service have kept me coming back at least twice a week since they opened.  Every dish is better than the next and the familial atmosphere are the primary reasons why Spiga is my choice for a quick dinner, date night, dinner with friends, family dinners and special occasions.  Fernando and Paula (owners), as well as Jamie, Leslie, Wade, Ashley, Courtney, Alexandra, Fernando and the other gracious staff at Spiga make every meal a beautiful one."}
{"text":"Another terrific recommendation not only does the menu offer variety the portions are plentiful and the meals we had were very tasty from the apps to the entree , this all comes at a great value ! There are a number of terrific restaurants in the area that we have visited on our vacations here in the Phoniex area , however this is one of the best values in the area . I must also say service was terrific as well !  Great job to the team @ Spiga Cucina  Team"}
{"text":"We ate here for dinner on Saturday night and had a nice meal.  The outdoor patio was cooled with misters, so we sat outside despite it being a bit warm outside.  The patio was lovely.  The service was VERY good and attentive.  Our server didn't do a great job on wine recommendations, but other than that, he was fantastic. We tasted the bufola mozz appetizer, shrimp appetizer, seafood platter, chicken parm and the seafood pasta.  Everyone was happy with their meals.  Nobody was AMAZED, but we were all very satisfied and thought the food was cooked beautifully (and healthy... no overuse of oils/butter, etc).  I would have gone 5 stars if the wine recommendations had been better.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to give them a try again. They seem to have worked out all the kinks since they opened couple years ago...the service is better, portion sizes are huge, food tasted great. The only reason for minus one star is because our food came out so fast from the kitchen. It only took like 5 minutes for our pasta dishes. Made us wonder how fresh our food was, but it tasted great."}
{"text":"Obsessed!!! I come here every other week the food is sooooo good I've tried almost everything and there is nothing I can say I didn't like love love love this place"}
{"text":"We were seated in the bar area and found it to be very noisy, could not carry on a conversation without shouting.   As far as the food, I had Pasta Bolanese my wife had Pasta Pompadoro, it was probably the worst we have ever had.  Being east coast Italians it was far less than we expected.  We heard that Spiga was the best thing to happen to North Scottsdale, certainly not in our opinion.  We won't be returning, we will continue to frequent Pane-Vino were they know Italian."}
{"text":"This is got to be the best restaurant you can go to for any reason you can think of.  You will not be disappointed no matter what you order.  Food servers are amazing, management is amazing,  The whole experience is amazing."}
{"text":"The shrimp pasta was five star. Atmosphere is great and servers were very knowledgable of the menu."}
{"text":"Very nice Italian here. Drinks were on the money. Pasta was cooked to perfection. Prices were very good. Good local place."}
{"text":"The food was AMAZING. I had a fish dish for two shared with my mom and we added on some of their homemade pasta which was phenomenal.  We also had pizza for an appetizer which was great as well. The service was also very good, we had Dillion who was very friendly, gave us great suggestions and was just a pleasant server to have so that added to the wonderful experience. I wish I could give 5 stars but this place is very crowded and VERY loud. They definitely have issues with sound absorption that really needs to be taken care of. My 3 year old niece was plugging her ears complaining of the noise and my mother said she was extremely bothered.  We couldn't even talk to each other.  If only I can take the food and service and move it to a place that wasn't so loud then this would be the perfect restaurant"}
{"text":"Excellent! No negatives. Beautiful space. Huge and diverse wine selection. Fantastic menu. Great specials. Wonderful service. Very, very good spot. Only negative is I wish that I'd found it sooner."}
{"text":"Very average food, at best, combined with the worst service I've had in years--the guy who took our order a half hour after we sat down didn't tell us the specials, didn't suggest a salad, didn't ask if I wanted another beer, didn't remove unused wine glasses, didn't bring additional bread, didn't offer parmesan, didn't have an apparent personality--need I go on?  The patio looks nice, but given the view is onto the parking lot, I'd take a pass on this place!"}
{"text":"I must say any prior problems I had with this restaurant has been remedied for sure.  Fernandez the owner personally reached out to me & sincerely apologized. The lack of sending a gift card for my reservation problem was truly, according to him a definite oversight. Perhaps my faith in mankind has been restored! The most important thing is he lived up to his word. Spiga  has been one of my ultimate favorites..... food is outrageous and the proprietor turned out to be top shelf ....... it truly was an oversight!"}
{"text":"Service: Sat at a high table. Waitress was great. Even asked for a special order modification that was granted.   Atmosphere: A bit on the loud side.  Price: Reasonable especially for the food quality.  Food: Got the seafood combination. Everything perfectly cooked. Could have used a little sprinkle of salt, but better not enough than too much. Lobster tail had sand in it, needs better rinsing. Also the shrimp was bigger than the lobster.   Overall: First time there ever. 5/5 stars.  Thanks!   P.s. friend had pasta with shrimp and it was cooked perfectly, sauce flavor just right, and plenty of shrimp! She loved it."}
{"text":"Great Saturday afternoon happy hour  Amazing bottomless champagne  Pizza  Meat and cheese boards  Misted patio very open and very inviting Best sexy Scottsdale restaurant"}
{"text":"This restaurant is really a nice addition to the area. Tonight Colin was our server and we were in very good hands. We sat outside and although it was a chilly evening, the heat lamps and seats were perfect. We ordered a lovely wine and it was brought out right away. Our appys were the beet ravioli and the caprese three way. Both are different from most restaurants and very tasty.  Dinner was the short rib for me, which is scrumptious, the fish special and the beef ravioli for my dinner mates. Portion sizes are generous and everyone loved their  meals. We did not need dessert but the menu made it irresistible so we indulged in the Creme Brûlée. Yum!! This place is a lovely treat."}
{"text":"Beautiful place. Delicious food. The Burrata was excellent (hard not impress me with my favorite milky cheese-inside joke). And the Chicken Parmigiana, although it wasn't what I ordered, was the best I've ever had. I ordered their version of Shrimp Scampi (can't remember the name) but it was also yummy. Highly recommend Spiga!"}
{"text":"I took photos here last weekend for a baby shower being held in the private room. The restaurant decor is beautiful, modern, and rustic looking (a photographer's dream come true!).  I was fortunate enough to taste some of the food in between shooting and everything was delicious! Main dishes for the party were served family style which included the mushroom risotto, sesame crusted salmon w/ chicken and veggies, and pasta w/ bacon in cream sauce. Presentation and taste were amazing! Staff was on point and always made sure everyone's glasses were full.  Can't wait to go back and have my husband try the food, too!  A new favorite for sure :) Make sure you get there early for dinner on the weekends because it seemed to get packed pretty early on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in the valley.... the owners Paula and Fernando are always present to greet, chat, suggest and smile !!! Outstanding food and the patio in March is by far the best seat in the valley !!!  All the dishes are fantastic but it is clear that the owners are particularly proud of the seafood dishes.... you cant go wrong here"}
{"text":"Tasty creative Italian food has arrived in North Scottsdale. Elegant yet casual setting. Beautiful patio. Perfectly sized portions, every bite was delicious. Try the ravioli or the sun dried chicken pesto dishes."}
{"text":"I wish there was a 1.5 star option. The food and service were surprisingly bad. I've been there probably 7 or 8 times and all had been good up until that point.  I had a group there for lunch this past weekend. Within our table, one person's pasta was stuck together in a ball and practically inedible, another's ravioli were more than al dente - they were raw. Service was very slow even though it was not busy.  Pretty disappointing since we had recommended it to others in our group."}
{"text":"I wish there were more than five stars to give Spiga!.  Beautiful location (especially the patio).  Food was delicious - service was excellent.  Wine list is huge with many choices at all price points.  Prices seems reasonable for the high quality food and drink.  Music was a little too loud and not really appropriate for the surroundings.  Our new favorite spot."}
