{"text":"I can't attest to the beer, but everything else about this place was pretty abysmal.  Atmosphere/ambiance - weird. Stage still there from jazz bar and it's just taking up space and awkward. Also feels like a cafeteria. Tables are very spread out and there's just not much to the whole space.  Food - decent, but definitely not worth the price. We had the calamari appetizer, a salad, 2 kids meals and some beer and paid $52.  Service - waiter was very attentive and nice, but scattered. He forgot our main meal and then actually offered to take the item off our bill. Well, yeah. You think?"}
{"text":"Pretty good food and really good beer but service was not the best. Got the wrong order and it was not corrected.  Also waited a really long time with an empty beer for the check."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place. Love the atmosphere, the dog friendly patio, the bar set up, love that they offer other cocktails (for the non beer drinkers) The staff is always friendly(although they sure seem to have quite the employee turn over) However the food......oh the food.....not good. We have eaten there twice now, and I must say I have been disappointed both times.  I will visit Sleepy Dog again (my boyfriends favorite pub) but I'll go else where for food first."}
{"text":"We went there not long after they first opened, ordered the boneless wings to share while we drank some beer. The beer kept coming very fast, the food took forever. Once we finally received the boneless wings, they were cold and not edible.  We have since, been back three or four times and each time it seems to get better. We always receive our drinks quickly and their burgers are amazing. The hummus is really tasty as well and my 12 month old son, loves their veggie burger. I really hope that people decide to give this place a fair chance. We love it, its dog friendly and we want them to stick around!!!"}
{"text":"Good beer. Terrible service. My friend and I were in last night, while it was very slow. We were sitting at their outdoor bar, by ourselves, and it took exactly 17 minutes (yes, I actually timed it) from when I finished my first drink for one of the EIGHT unoccupied servers (and manager-owner!) to notice and offer me another.  They were too busy audibly complaining about other customers and coworkers to notice my empty glass. Disappointing since the beer is actually good. They will need to make a huge change in their service standards for a place like this to stay afloat."}
{"text":"They definitely have some kinks to work out! They're a new place- so I'm giving them a break with the problems I've had going there.  Their patio is lovely and the beer is enjoyable.  I, personally, love the Wet Snout Stout :). Hopefully my review helps you in the future, I would like to see this pub be successful!   The musicians that are chosen on stage are always very talented. The sound is very crisp which is nice- sometimes a little loud but as long as the musician are great, I have no complaints there.   I'm a resident of the area so I've gone into the pub several times since it opened. Each time there was something irritatingly wrong with the meal.   The first time a group of my friends: the food was terribly prepared (the macaroni was drowning in bread crumbs? soggy hamburger buns and undercooked meat). The manager was very apologetic and came to our table- but I felt like he should send the cook out to apologize, then maybe the food will turn out better.  Second time I was overcharged horribly for a 5 oz piece of chicken. I literally just asked for a serving of grilled chicken. So I got charged for one of their entire chicken sandwich meals- without actually receiving any of the sides that come with the meal. On top of that my friend's burger was again soggy and undercooked.    Third time, we just stopped in for drinks, our checks only came out to 5 dollars each at the most. The waitress collected all of our money from our checks and didn't bother to come back with some of our change, assuming that out of a 20 dollar bill we gave her she was going to take 15 of that for her tip (?).  I'll be back for those draft beers :] and maybe the food will get better with time... Again I want to say: Hopefully my review helps you in the future, I would like to see this pub be successful! Good luck Sleepy Dog!"}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE their beer, especially the Wet Snout. The atmosphere is friendly and the staff is friendly and accommodating. We have become regulars here! We can even bring our dog, Lilly if we want."}
{"text":"All three of the times I have tried this place I have waited 45+ minutes for my overpriced food, and the place was dead each of the times so I'm not sure what the excuse was. Then when the food arrived it was cold. My in-laws have also gone twice and walked out the second time because the server greeted them and then after 40 min never returned to their table. After three strikes, I am out and never going back."}
{"text":"The wife and I recently stopped by for a night out, and I was excited to try Sleepy Dog having drove by on several occasions but never had the chance to stop in. Our usual hang out (McDuffy's) closed a few months back and we have been jumping around trying to find a cool neighborhood spot to call ours. Sleepy Dog definately fits the mold but did not overly impress. Beer was awesome, food was ok (small menu) and we will skip dessert next time. The musician that was playing was outstanding (cant remember the kids name). All in all, decent place to hang after eating dinner at home. We will definately be back but probably just for drinks. One thing we saw all night that really chaps my ass was that there was no host/hostess. We were sat fairly quickly but we saw on several occasions people walk out because they were not being greeted/seated timely. I know that irriattes me to no end so I dont blame the people that left for doing so but Sleep Dog lost out on 4-6 tables just for not having a host. GET A HOST PLEASE."}
{"text":"Beer and apps were okay but if you are looking for any sort of craft brewing atmosphere this is not it. Service was below average yet the place was slow. I like Sleepy Dog in Tempe but will never return to this location. Maybe it's an attempt to appeal to everyone but it just doesn't work here."}
{"text":"This review pertains only to the food and service as we didn't drink. As stated on other reviews the setup is poor and seems to neither serve the dining nor bar crowd well. My wife ordered the bratwurst, only to find out about 15 minutes after ordering it they were out. She settled on the mac n cheese which after an exceeding long wait could only be described as mac n milk. A hostess asked us about our experience and the manager did comp her meal.  I had the East Vally burger which was fine but nothing special. It sounded better on paper than in reality. The servers while nice didn't seem to be very good, though I will complement the hostesses for being outstanding. As a dining experience I would not recommend the Sleepy Dog though we may not be the clientele they're looking for."}
{"text":"They must have retrained their servers. Last time we came service was horrible. This time around our waitress Terese, was awesome! Within one minute of us sitting down she brought my son a drink. Our food and drinks were taken and brought out quickly, and she checked on us continuously!"}
{"text":"This place was very disappointing! The food is mediocre at best and the service was terrible. We waited 40 mins for an appetizer and then another 40 for the food."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed by this place initially but have come to love it. We had a bad experience early on but decided to give it another shot. The beer is fantastic, the service is amazing, and the food gets better every time. If you haven't been back give it another shot!"}
{"text":"The places has a fatal design flaw, and that's the bar.  The bar is far too small. The strength of this place is its beer selection, and so it's identity should primarily be as place to get great beer, and only secondarily, as a place to get food. SanTan Brewery has this balance right - you know walking in that the emphasis is on drinking given the size of the bar. Everything else is secondary.   But because Sleepy Dog's bar is so small, the identify of the place is less a drinking establishment, and more of a place to eat. Unfortunately, with the current menu offerings and the quality of their food, they're not yet capable of pulling that off. The place it out of balance.  So, they're either going to have to make big changes to the menu and quality of their food, or they're going to have rethink the bar and atmosphere to emphasize their strength - which is their drink offerings. Were they to do that, they could have a winner. But they're not even close right now."}
{"text":"So, I had The Beer Sampler with was great $5 for Happy Hour For 5 Good Beers can't bet it. The atmosphere and the service is really nice. As far as the food I had the Fried Calamari was not a fan sadly not flavor even with the dipping sauce didn't make a big difference. But I will go back and I have been. I haven't ate anything else but I did have a few beer. I will be back soon"}
{"text":"Great craft beer and great staff!! Love the live musicians!!"}
{"text":"As a number of others have said, the beer is good with a good number of choices. The food is pretty good too.  The biggest issue has been service. The waitstaff is very friendly but I have had to wait ridiculously long times for very simple items. It should not take 45 mins to make fish tacos on a fairly un busy night, nor should it take 45 mins for a brownie.  I'll probably go back, for the beer, if nothing else. Hopefully, they put a few more seats on the patio before then."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the Leg Humper Hefeweizen.  Hubby enjoyed the Red Rover Amber Ale. Had the chicken club with bacon and avacado. Great. Hubby had brat sandwich which had caramelized onions. I am not usually a brat lover, but I enjoyed the bite that I got. We went for lunch on a Saturday which was good for us."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday and service was ok server seemed busy. Beer was good but we ordered a sampler and no explanation was given on which beer was what. We ordered a few appetizers as well. Calamari was good but way overpriced for what was given.  Also ordered brewshetta as they call it and they offer five options for $10 but we found out of the five options you can only choose one for the entire order. The bread was soft and soggy and it was too much of one type, it would have been nice if there was variety. Needless to say it did not taste very interesting.  Atmosphere was so so. We had limited time to be out  and did not want to stay so we got our check and realized we were charged regular price for drinks even though it was the middle of happy hour. We did not want to wait to get it fixed so we just paid it and quickly left to a bar across the street to spend the remainder of our time. I understand they are new and so service can sometimes be slow as they work out the kinks but appetizers at this time are not worth the visit and I can get many beer options across the street at the two other bars with  good food."}
{"text":"We went here on may 4 2013. The beer was good, but we ordered the creme brûlée because it was one of two? Gluten free items in the menu, and it was awful! They must have thought we never have had that dessert before or something, but what they sent out was more of a warm soup. It was obvious that they had no creme brûlée on hand so quickly tried to make some, not realizing it takes hours. They crisped sugar over a chunky, warm soup-like pudding and tried to pass it off as the real thing. It was ridiculous. Needless to say we wont be going back for the 5$ plus beer.  Stick the university location and order in your own fully made food."}
{"text":"Come for the beer and the fun attitude but leave the food. I think they are trying too hard to be something....I don't know what. I'll just talk food for now since it's on my mind. We went for lunch today, Sunday afternoon about 1:30. We walked in there was one family having lunch, a large group jamming on instruments by the bar and no employees to be found. One of the guys from the instruments group came over and sat us - I have no idea if he had any affiliation with the place but he did a great job faking it if he didn't.   Finally our waitress came by and was very sweet. We worked her for recommendations but couldn't really get anything solid. Maybe she was new or maybe vegan. I ordered a SW chicken sandwich on flatbread, husband got the portobello flatbread, older kid got crispy buffalo chicken sandwich and little one got the kid's burger. I ordered the house brewed IPA and it was good slightly bitter, husband got a lager - she couldn't remember the name. Both were good.   My sandwich came out and the first thing I noticed is a corner of my flatbread is gone, which was just weird and kind of gross. I removed all the bread which was cold anyway, and pulled out a fork and knife. I take a bite and a flavor was just off. On this sandwich was: thin breast of chicken, white cheese of some sort, bacon, green chile,  sautéed or some sort of marinated onions, avocado, chipotle sauce, tomatoes, and PICKLES. Why the pickles? That's just weird and I like pickles. So I remove the pickles. Take another bite still odd. So taste everything individually and it's the onion that didn't taste right. I take those out and the breadless sandwich gets much better. Should I have just sent it back? Maybe, but I suffer from Catholic guilt. I also had sweet potato fries and those were good! (see positive!)  My husband seemed to enjoy his portobello and salad, the buffalo chicken was a bit spicy for my older kid but he enjoyed it, the little one enjoyed his burger and fries as tiny as it was. We also ordered what we thought were fried mashed potato balls (go ahead be crude I live with all males) but when my little guy bit into one it was actually goat or blue cheese not a good surprise. I guess two balls are potato and two are the cheese mixture. The potato was a hit with the boys.   We had been there before for the Full Sail tap takeover and loved it. Great beer at great prices. The atmosphere is light and fun but kind of a mess. They had a Wii game set up and the jam session happening. The night we were there for the Full Sail event tables were askew and not cleaned, the toss game was leaning on a wall just very casual. We will probably return for the tap take over nights and when it's cooler and we want to bring our dog somewhere but not to eat."}
{"text":"It pains me to write this review. I want to love Sleepy Dog, but they go out of their way to make sure you don't enjoy your experience.   My first visit was with a coworker about two months after they opened. I sat at the bar for just drinks and had great service. The bartender had great beer recommendations and was friendly. We then ordered some appetizers which took forever to arrive, well over 30 minutes. The bartender kept apologizing and mentioned the kitchen was still \"getting up to speed\". Understandable. Apps were a little overcooked, but not bad. Just OK.   Next visit I went with my wife for dinner about three months after they opened. It was a gorgeous evening so we opted to sit outside. We grabbed a table and waited. And waited. And waited. No server came by. It had been 12 minutes and no one greeted us. I set 15 minutes as a walk-out point. At 13 minutes we were finally greeted and our drink order was taken. It then took 10 minutes for our drinks to arrive. So now we've already been here 23 minutes. We ordered calamari for an app, I ordered fish n chips, and my wife ordered a burger. The calamari was thick cut which i had not seen before and was pretty tasty. Our food took quite a while, but I didn't mind as it was nice out. The fish n chips was not very good and was slightly overcooked. My wife's burger was a bit dry and she didn't even finish it.   Pricing would be fine if the service was better and food quality improved, but it's just not there. I would recommend Sleepy Dog for their beer, but not for the food at this point."}
{"text":"Food is \"ok\" and the price is a little on the higher side then what I would say its worth. The beer is great, and a very fun atmosphere. I like to get the sample beer tray to mix it up, but always find myself going back for the Wet Snout milk stout and Leg Humper Hef."}
{"text":"Please bring back the sweet potato fries.    They were the best I had  Burgers are really good and the beer is terrific  Love the service and managers"}
{"text":"Train wreck!!!!!!  A handful of staff (??????) seated at a booth with their tablets - the F bomb flew out several times.  Get an office - booths are for customers.  Flavorless burger well done :(. No theme, except dogs.  Some Irish food, reggae music.  We won't return."}
{"text":"A partnership between a craft brewery and a one bar out in SE Gilbert should be a home run, but it is far from it. This place has tremendous beer selections, and the Sleepy Dog beers themselves are alright. The staff is tremendous in personality and friendliness but food is slow and on each of our trips the server missed a part of our meal (forgot a salad last Friday, missed our appetizer the Friday before) The food is just not good. The bruschetta toast came out burnt and our server said that's just toasted. The chicken on my wife's sandwich was extremely dry and not fresh. Fries often are delivered cold. Additionally, with bands every night and karaoke, the ownership seems to want this pub to be a dive bar with craft beer and poor food.  And that's fine ... But we expected place with tremendous fresh food and many craft beer choices."}
{"text":"I am EXTREMELY PLEASED to be able to give an update to my last review.  I met a girlfriend for drinks here last Friday (9.20) after warning her that the last few visits I wasn't very impressed.  HOLY SMOKES did they knock it out of the park this time!  Seated immediately and even though I was waiting for my friend to arrive, they kept checking on me if I needed anything.  Wings?  OMG SHUT CHO MOUF - freakin TO.DIE.FOR.  Amazing flavor and they literally fall right off the bone.  I am forever spoiled eating wings ANYWHERE else.  Service?  Wow. wow. wow.  Anthony (who is also one of the mangers, I learned) was AH-MAZING.  Kept our drinks filled, checked on us, moved us to the patio from indoors (at our request) with no problem, was so patient when we STILL hadn't decided if we wanted anything to eat or not.  Great guy, great service and I much appreciated how receptive he was to my feedback about my prior visits.  They are trying and they ARE succeeding!    This visit alone prompted me to return 2 days later on Sunday (9.22) for some football with another friend.  Again, great beer, great service and AMAZING wings.  We also tried the bloody marys and were NOT disappointed.  House made bloody mary mix that was fantastic.  I am spoiled (again!) that I will never be able to have another bloody mary anywhere else that will compare to this one.    You are my new favorite place, Sleepy Dog!  I'm pleased as punch that you have turned this around because you are literally a 5 minute drive from home.  KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!!!!"}
{"text":"First time here. The beer was great and the food wasn't bad. My waitress was friendly but a bit on the slow side. They have their grand opening on 4/20/13. I'm sure the kinks will be worked out by then."}
{"text":"was impressed.  Good food, service and atmosphere.  Difficult time finding the joint, needs better signage."}
{"text":"I'm usually pretty long-winded, but no need in this case.  We had a great visit on March 16th for the following reasons:  The beer selection.  Their own brews are great, but they have some guest taps that provide some very interesting and adventurous choices.  Brews like O'Dell Myrcenary.  The shrimp satay.  This is a wonderfully prepared dish.  Two skewers of 3 very large bacon-wrapped shrimp each, grilled to perfection with a light garlic tomato compote, couscous, and nice sesame stir-fried vegetables on the side, although I think the addition of something green like snow peas or sugar snap peas to the vegetables would add to the appeal.  Justin the bartender.  GREAT service.    Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I seriously don't understand the unkempt owner slamming down drinks. Does he not take this business seriously?  We were fully aware of him wandering around and, frankly, felt uncomfortable.   Get a handle on service, time of food to table and the food itself. We can't go back or make a positive review until these things are addressed. I was SO hoping this was THE new, cool place to go in Gilbert but I was so disappointed. Good beer, but that's about all. I don't understand the table/booth seating set up either.   OWNERS..stop focusing on your own drinks and start focusing on service, food, atmosphere and the customer experience. It's not just about the dogs."}
{"text":"my husband and I have been to the Sleepy Dog in Tempe and fell in love with the beer so we were very excited that they now have a location in Gilbert.  We were anxious to try the food and we were not disappointed.  My husband had a black and blue with sweet potato fries.  It was delish!  Despite the other reviews i have read, we thought the burger was very flavorful and juicy.  The sweet potato fries were crispy on the outside, soft and sweet on the inside.  Perfect.  I had the fish and chips with jicama slaw.  I loved every bite.  The slaw had sweet red peppers, jicama and a zesty sauce.  Very good!  Enough cannot be said about the beer.  Sleepy Dog beer is wonderful.  We love every one of them.  They also have a great tap selection of other   Sleepy Dog in Gilbert has only been opened for a couple of days and we were impressed.  Yes, there are some bugs to be worked out which is to be expected.  We definitely will be going back.  Update- Went last night (1/4/14) around 8pm.  Sign said \"closed for the holidays\".  Holidays are over.  What gives???"}
{"text":"I've been there three times and if I had the option I'd give them 3.5 not 3.  My husband and I agree that their beer is the best  thing they have going for them. Their flavored mojitos have no flavor. We've had carnitas and mole tacos, as well as calamari and chorizo mac n' cheese.  The chorizo mac is delicious...calamari is overly breaded and the tacos are way under-seasoned.  We've had excellent service and will return, but only for apps and beer, until the food improves."}
{"text":"We have been going to the Sleepy Dog in Tempe weekly for about 5 months. The atmosphere, the beer, the people, everything is great!! NOW..this place is nothing like that! We showed up for opening day, was told a two hour wait. Looking around there was a small bar with limited seating, there is a huge awkward stage taking up a huge part of the room, inside and outside there are not a lot of tables, the place is loud and uninviting. The place was crowded with pretentious and trendy people that is avoided at the other location. So...we left!! We love the Tempe location because there is no other place like it...you can bring your own food, play games, watch a movie, eat popcorn and chat with everyone around you! It's comfortable and  there are no belligerent drunks or a pretentious setting.  I hope that the Tempe location stays open for a long time because of its one of a kind place and the vibe it offers! We have referred many people to that location, but WILL NOT be returning to San Tan nor referring anyone there! This place offers what every other bar offers (which is bad) and the parking sucks!!"}
{"text":"This place is a good bar and has great food (burgers an appetizers). The thing that puts them over most is the beer and drinks they have. Well priced and have catching names as well. I would highly recommend this place to other people."}
{"text":"We have been in a couple times, most likely won't go back. They seem to get a kick out of bringing your meal with no silverware. This has happened to us both times we have been here. No napkin, no salt/pepper, no silverware So, you sit and stare at your meal as getting the silverware takes a long time. Meanwhile, your meal gets cold. Basic service 101, epic fail.   Also, the food is just average here, nothing special at all. If this place just opened and has any interest in building a base of regulars, they are just blowing it. I doubt they will be open in a year. Warrens had better food, better service and way better bands. They could not make it, why would a place that puts no importance in those items?"}
{"text":"Ugh; slow service (and they were DEAD); rare burger (ordered medium well); cold fries; and 3 out of 4 of our orders were messed up...the band was good but food and service were awful; if you want to open a restaurant; this place will be available in 6 months."}
{"text":"Looks like this dog is Dead.  No great loss IMO, but it was nice having a locally made beer alternative to Gordon Bierch in the far east valley.   The Sleepy Dog beers all have a slightly sweet finish, this is a sign of inexperience and reminds me of brewpubs of the 90's. The food and service was up and down like a yo-yo, as was the decor, bar setup, and general management.  To bad with proper management, and beer, this place had potential.   Good news is there are 3 new eating/drinking establishments across the street.   Blue 32 Sports Grill Harvey American Public House Fox Cigar Bar (My personal favorite)  All three offer a nice selection of craft beers on taps, live music, and above all excellent service.   The Sleepy Dog didn't stand a chance."}
{"text":"Decent happy hour beer specials but little personality compared to the Tempe location- might be worth the further drive! The food seemed a little pricey for a pub with menu items all over the place, no general theme. The space is pretty big so even with 7 tables filled it seemed empty. They have a great patio where you can bring your dog, major plus! However, I would have loved seeing the TVs from the outside!"}
{"text":"The beer is awesome, and the bar staff was very knowledgeable.  The patio looks comfortable, but we'll have to try it out once it cools off."}
{"text":"Went there for an early dinner after their grand opening. Decor is ok, the restaurant has a huge stage, that's awkwardly placed in the middle of the back wall, tables sparsely placed around the restaurant. As per the menu, happy hour is everyday from 2-7p.   We ordered the beer sampler, my husband ordered the Onion Burger and I ordered the East Valley Burger. (both medium well) and mac & cheese with fries for our kiddo. Beer came and it was good, the waiter didn't really explain much of the beers, nor the seasonal, he just gave us the paper that goes with the sampler that describes the beers. They were a good size for samplers, enough for both of us to taste and have more than 4 sips each. Our son's food came, with apple slices instead of  the fries we order; the waiter came back apologetic with the fries (FYI- the restaurant has no kiddie cups or to go cups for the kids drinks, just big, glass cups. Def not kid friendly).   Our burgers came, both burgers were beyond well done, mind you we ordered them medium; we let the waiter know, but at this point we had already bitten into our flavorless burgers. Did I mention flavorless? Yes, they were; there was no seasoning whatsoever on them, they tasted like regular cooked ground beed. The onion burger claims it has horseradish cream sauce...there was less than a sliver on the burger; meanwhile the East Valley burger is described as having a cilantro lime sour cream...again a sliver, we could barely taste it. After our son was done eating, we asked for his ice cream, as it's part of his meal. The ice cream tasted like it has been sitting in the freezer for months and months. You know the kind, where there's freezer burn on your ice cream but you eat it anyway because you just have to have it...yeah that kind. Our son, who LOVES ice cream, didn't even eat it.   We then asked for our check; upon reviewing it, I noticed that we had been charged the regular price for the sampler. I asked the waiter and he said that it wasn't happy hour, so I pulled out the beer menu where it clearly states: HAPPY HOUR EVERYDAY 2-7p (and then the bottom describes what the specials are); he then went to the manager and comped (is that even a word?) , whatever, he reduced the price of the beer sampler.   Would we return? Maybe for their beers and possibly appetizers.  The service, beer selection and location is good, food...eh I've had better. However, I think I'd rather save my $$ and go to OHSO Brewery in Phoenix; and if we want a good, TASTY burger we'll go to Teakwoods."}
{"text":"I have to agree with most yelpers on this one the food is poor the beer is good. However the service was great. My friend ordered the flat bread pizza and when it came out it was a cheese pizza with a salad on top (not appealing at all). When the waitress came to ask how everything was he complained and she said that she would comp the pizza and get him the southwest pizza and comped that one too. So they are trying but I think they just need a new menu or a new cook.  I would go back for the beer."}
{"text":"Thought we would try the place for lunch and sadly very disappointed. The food was poor.   We got two \"beer\" bread flatbreads and it was more like stale flour bread.  We were the only group in the entire restaurant for the entire time we were there.   They need to step up their quality or they will sadly be out."}
{"text":"I seriously was wanting to love this place my wife and I love the brewery in Tempe well this bistro did not live up to the brewery whatsoever. The reason they get two stars is the service was actually pleasant, the food was Meh just as the rating states my wife thought her burger was alright not good great or bad just alright she had the Big Onion Burger fries were ok I ordered the Pot Roast that came with horse radish scalloped potatoes (which I was excited about) well the pot roast was supposed to come with vegetables as well I had a piece of carrot maybe an onion and 2 small pieces of celery that was it the beef was ok warm not hot but what I was excited about the scalloped potatoes came out soggy and cold which I told the waitress she apologized and went to get a replacement and guess what just as cold. The waitress once again apologized then a manager came by to do the same and comped a desert which was the chocolate bread pudding which came out room temperature to warm when i get a bread pudding i am expecting it to be hotter. The beers well they were good but when we received our check the first two beers we had were ordered during happy hour were not reduced in price, also speaking of happy hour we had decided on appetizers right at 7 and waitress at that time said sorry cannot get happy hour price, I am sorry come on work with me here.   I will not be coming back and I am sorry about that"}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoyed our first visit to Sleepy Dog Pub. The food was very tasty as well as the beer selection.  Fun place, too!  One of the owners came by our table and gave us some good recommendations of what to order.  Thanks,we will return soon."}
{"text":"Went there this evening with a friend at 4 pm. Sat out on the patio, which was really nice...for a while. By 5, loud and obnoxious people surrounded us. I did not like the atmosphere at all. I also wish I had known smoking was allowed on the patio before I was seated there. The staff was super friendly and attentive. Try the street tacos! They were great!"}
{"text":"We were really excited to try a new place with live music.  Pros-  1. Great beer 2. Friendly staff.  Cons-  1. Really subpar food (at least the things that we ordered.  2. Very small menu (that were on filthy well used printer paper) 3. Shockingly unfortunate margaritas (perhaps just an unskilled bartender) 4. A band that started 45 minutes late and conducted a loud, feedback rich sound check for more than a half hour of our meal.  5.  The overall look, atmosphere and branding is really inconsistent.   The floor plan and patio are really cool and the potential for live music is promising. However, it would appear that the powers that be really put the cart before the horse with the launch of this venture."}
{"text":"This place is chill. Dog friendly patio. Stage for live music. Full bar. Two TVs on patio, nice, but wish there were more.   Had the hummus, which was just OK.  Family friendly too..."}
{"text":"Being in the industry for over 9 years this place is one of the biggest disappointments I've been to recently. I was excited to see a micro brew pub in Gilbert. Beers were good if you don't mind them served in room temperature glasses. After placing our Appetizer order, It took over 40 Minutes to hit the table. Another 20 min and our dinner came out. Both with Regular fries, When we both ordered Sweet potato fries. \"No big deal, it happens\". But after a hour of waiting for our food it gets annoying.  In our 2 hours of being there. Not once did the manager stop by and talk to a single table in the restaurant. Clearly there is no direction on the kitchen. and who I assume is \"The owner\" was working on his 6th drink watching it all unfold. SOMEONE needs to take charge, Or again there's going to be another name change on this building!!   (I'm not one to complain, but something needs to be done)"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here about a dozen times since the February opening, and I've really held out on writing a review hoping Sleepy Dog would work out the kinks, but to no avail.  I was so excited when this place opened, and truthfully the first couple of visits were great. However, the food quality, service, and ambiance have all declined drastically. We've tried nearly the entire menu...and it's just not great. The bruschetta is abysmal (especially when you consider that Postino is about 4 miles away), burgers are inconsistently cooked, and I once had a ruben that looked like a child's grilled cheese.  The decline in quality is very evident as my last visit (last week), there were no customers in the place at 4pm on a weekday (Happy Hour?). To top it off, they were out of two of their OWN microbrews.  I want this place to succeed but it's going to take a makeover of the menu and perhaps management.  Save your money and try Blue 32 or Harvey American across the street, or really treat yourself to a quality microbrew at San Tan Brewery in Chandler."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite hangout. The beer is great. The food quality was excellent. I had the shrimp satay and the shrimp were quality, the dish was amazing, even the veggies tasted good and were part of the dish,... not sure an after thought. My wife got the black bean burger and it was tasty. We also ordered the beer cheese soup. It was pretty good. I rated this five stars because the place is going to be amazing once they get their \"newness kinks\" worked out..  Pros- Love the look and feel Food was kick-ass! Very Tasty and Fresh! Fantastic Beer - Had the leg humper You could tell all the staff was friendly The Management was good to us, stopped by and talked with us about the wait, etc.  A couple small suggestions for the management - note these \"complaints\" come from a good place, we really love you guys and want you to be the best you can be.  -When we first came in the hostess station was abandoned. We waited a few minutes and a girl walked slowly over, offered to seat us then was overall just slow...make sure she knows to be quick when seating, ask how many are in the party and inside/outside. She was very sweet, she just needs to execute a little faster. -You were out of high chairs for our 2 year old (I saw one or two in use already)..buy a couple more, you are in Gilbert which is Family crazy...you will need more.  -I saw a server drinking beer, then running out to help a table -I got my beer right away but my wife's ice tea was forgotten. Our server was not back to remind her and it took about 15 minutes to get her drink. Our server noted she was new and apologized. She was awesome, we really liked her, she just needs a little more training. She was also slow to check on us, bring our check, etc. The place is not huge, servers need to be on top of it. Watch for empty drinks, clear plates quickly, etc. Keep this server 100% she is great, just more training and urgency! Tell her to pretend she is a member of each table in her mind and to look out for her friends, do they need something, are they done?  -When our beer cheese soup came out it came without spoons. It took us 5 mins or so to get somebody's attention to get spoons. Also, the crouton was funky, swap it for a regular purchased crouton or make sure yours is crunchy, it was crunchy on the outside but kinda stale and chewy on the inside. The soup itself was super good! -Food took a long time, you mentioned you were short a cook and I totally get it - the food was absolutely worth the wait.    I feel kind of guilty posting this, I love the place so much...I have no doubt you guys will be 110% soon."}
{"text":"I was so excited to have this back open after the turnover from the previous establishment WARRENS. The first few months it was open,  familiar staff, one in specific Jason who was a rockstar, dog friendly, great service, live music and the bar menu wasn't too bad.  I went back a week ago and found that there is a complete new staff who was pretty much clueless, didn't not have any of the beverages we requested which are staples such as bottles water, energy drinks and a simple lager beer.  Lastly the \"NEW\" BAR MENU WAS HORRIBLE   They did away with the only two things that were DESCENT,  chicken tacos and the brownie dessert.   The only way this place will make it if they get their staff trained correctly, stock their shelves w normal beverages, and create a new, appetizing menu  with great regular bar food that is norm for a pub bar!!!!   They need more tv's for sports and maybe some arcade games to keep the ambience going"}
{"text":"We could not find any place to get a seat for the UFC fight then I remembered this little place by the gym.  They did not charge a cover like some of the other bars.  We were able to get an inside or outside seat right in front of the TV.  Service was very friendly and quick.  The burgers were perfect and the people, manager included, could not do enough for us.  I was so pleased to find this place.  I see some of the earlier reviews were not so good, but, this was not our experience.  Give this place a shot.  If your looking for easy, simple, and a nice local bar ambiance, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars, I would: what is this place? A haven for craft-brew enthusiasts? A wanna-be bistro? Animal shelter activist headquarters? I don't bloody get it. 1.) it took the waitress 20 minutes to shove two tables together to accommodate our party of 8 (4 adults and 4 small kids.) The restaurant wasn't busy, but the staff spent so much time drinking with the patrons they couldn't be bothered to do the necessary shoving.  2.) the waitress took order, disappeared to drink and chat at the bar, came back about 40 mins later with food. 3.) hubby ordered a burger, no complaints. Elder kiddo ordered fish and chips, and proceeded to eat only the fries (thin cut fast food fries, not \"chips\".) The fish was slightly undercooked and overly greasy-- not sure how that was accomplished. It was served with what was supposed to be slaw, but was just red cabbage in an oily dressing. My kid never turns her nose up at any fish, but she didn't even touch it.  I ordered the brats and mashed potatoes to share with my youngest kiddo-- the fresh veggie sauté was excellent and the mashed potatoes with bacon were fantastic...at least the few bites that weren't drowned in an unpleasant, bitter onion-and-beer-based reduction. The brats were also doused in the powerfully bitter gravy, but no matter, since they were undercooked as well. A nice steak should be pink in the middle, a sausage should not be. Ick. I'd have complained to the waitress but she never reappeared.... 3.) ... In fact she hadn't come back by the time I left with the kids and my hubby stayed with my friend's hubby to try the horchata-orange beer the pub was unveiling that night. Who knows when she wandered back.  4.) live music too loud at 6 pm. 5.) hubby said that after my friend and I left with our respective kids, our table sat un-bussed for at least an hour. Some drink guy came up and asked if he could finish off my daughter's uneaten (and still uncleared away) plate of cold fish and chips, then helped himself... The horror.   This place made me think of where 40-ish post-hipsters go to drink away their remaining youth... Alcohol probably kills the salmonella from all the undercooked food, after all."}
{"text":"Too bad...so sad :( We waited 10 minutes for a hostess, plenty of dirty tables inside so we had to sit outside next to a chain smoker. Waited another 12 minutes for a server (that's just 3 minutes shy of us walking out). Waitress finally came and was super nice so we decided to stay (plus we had a gift card which must've been recycled because who would buy anyone a gift card to this place). Drinks took at least 15 minutes, maybe 20.  Beer sampler was fairly inexpensive but not very good. Food was not good at all, tasteless & unappealing. Sorry but no go :("}
{"text":"The best part of my meal was my drink. I had fireball and hard cider. For dinner I had  the chicken and waffles. They were ok. Probably would have been better if it was hot. But getting back to the drink. Yummy! Perfect for the season."}
{"text":"So far the wait for food, service, drinks, blah blah is a little excessive, like 30 minutes? Probably a good idea to over staff on a Saturday during the holidays right next to Kohls at lunch. Just sayn..   Food leaves something to be desired, sorta flavorless and heaven forbid you ask for ranch with a salad, it will take all day and will only arrive with the box after lunch. I would come back ONE more time for the beer and BEER alone, (just to try it).  The overall theme is a bit confusing, a stage at a brewery? Is it me or do I just not get out much, but a stage?"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times after my first review.    I would like to give them 1 star, but  I do like their beers and again they always have some awesome guest beers if you want to explore.   BUT that will be the only reason I will ever go back.  The food situation has not been solved and management / ownership at this place is embarrassing.     I along with my wife, kid, kids friend and dog went there Saturday night for dinner.   We of course due to the dog sat out on the patio, which was crowded but seats were available.   We found a table that had been partially cleaned (a few kid cups remained) and sat.   We moved the cups to the table next to us.   We waited for a few and our server appeared, took our drink order and went behind the bar.   Our server was also the bartender, on a busy Saturday night?  We watched this poor guy the entire night run back and forth pulled in 20 directions.   He worked hard, so any problems with had were not his fault, he just couldn't handle all that was going in.  So we get our appetizer,  bruchetta and like another reviewer stated a few pieces of the toast were burnt.  This shows me they have a lazy cook and / or no one checking their food before going out.  Oh did I mention the owner sucking down cocktail after cocktail two tables down and his manager sitting with him as all heck is going on?  My wife was not really hungry and the kids ordered food with the appetizer, but I am still hungry so I order dinner. 35 minutes later and no food.  Awesome!!!  After flagging him down our server comes to apologize and tells me the kitchen had been having issues tonight.   Awesome again, as I look over to the owner sucking down yet another drink.  10 more minutes pass, no food, now their manager strolls by.  Half his shirt not tucked in totally unshaven (not even the neatly hip and cool unshaved look) and I really haven't seen him do anything but talk to the owner and bs with customers he knows.   I tell him about my food, he apologizes and brings me my dinner about 5 to 10 later.   The food was fair not fantastic not horrible.  Nothing that I would go back for.  I will go back for beers, never again for food. . With ownership that finds it more important to drink on a Saturday night than make sure your customers are taken care of, who knows how much longer I will be able to just do that.   Get your leadership together DOG!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Sleepy Dogs a few times now and have not been disappointed yet! The service has been outstanding and my most recent visit proved that they really have some of the best wings that I've ever tasted. Another one of my all time favorites is the pretzels and beer cheese! I am a huge fan of beer and they have an excellent selection of Brews. I truly enjoyed the Red Rover Irish Ale and the Scootcher Scottish Amber Ale which I never would have tried had it not been for the manager Anthony. He was so patient and helpful in suggesting different beers and giving me samples to make sure I would be happy with my selection. I also had a really good experience recently when going there to watch football last Sunday night. Jake was our server and he had a great personality in addition to his distinct ability to find food choices that we thoroughly enjoyed. I love the vibe at this place...the live music is great and it's so cool that our dog can join us on the patio! I highly recommend Sleepy Dog Brewpub if your looking for a great atmosphere with excellent service and delicious food and beer!"}
{"text":"I'm a major craft beer drinker.  The beer here was totally awful.  The Irish Red had no malty flavor -- it was dry and empty. The IPA was soapy. The English Browne had no head and was flat. The Scottish Red tasted stale.  When it comes to the aroma, mouth, taste, and color, they only passed the color tests, which makes me wonder what was added to the beer.  We had the calamari, which wasn't to our taste, but it might be fine for others.  The style is like large breadsticks rather than rings.  Just not our style.  I hope this place gets better as Gilbert really needs a place like this.  Wanted to give 'em two stars but couldn't justify it.  [Our waitress was emotionless and didn't care that my English Browne was flat.]"}
