{"text":"Authentic and really good persian/Afghani grills. The service is a fast food style restaurant, but hey, who's complaining, If it's gonna get me excellent exotic food for the price of a couple of burgers.
The staff is super nice and are hard to work to build up their reputation. Their avocado sauce is a superb addition to any plate with right amount of spice in it."}
{"text":"Hands down THE BESTTTTTTT kabob place in Vegas maybe even in all of the west coast! 

Their ground beef kabobs are sooooo good and their meat kabobs were nice and tender and super flavorful but the key to an afghan restaurant is the rice and the mantu and OH MY GOSH it was sooooooo good 

After eating I usually pick and choose what I was crazy about and what i am not so crazy about or even dislike and after eating food from this restaurant I literally couldn't even say one dish was just ok because everything was delicious! 

Their meat is all organic and grain/grass fed and their bread oh man their bread is perfect

I will def. be going back here (I will post pictures next time it was too late this time :( ) and letting all of my friends, family members, and even strangers know about this restaurant. 

I almost forgot to add that their prices are also amazing for the amount and quality of food they provide you with.  

If you want kabobs/afghan food this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"It's the best afghan restaurant in vegas. It's a must see. The food is delicious specially the pumpkin bolani is bomb. I recommend this place if you are looking for best afghan food."}
{"text":"Excellent halal food. Seasoned very well and the green sauce was epic!!! Service was awesome!! Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Excellent!!! 5 Star - Attention to details and best taste from salad to appetizer to main course . Thanks!"}
{"text":"It was by default we found this place on yelp! It was as fellow yelpers describe, a hidden gem!
Excellent customer service! Excellent food! I am looking forward to the next time I can visit!"}
{"text":"2 words - lamb chops! Marinated and seasoned just right. The rice is also terrific.
If you live in LV (or have a car), this place is easy to find.
It is a take-out setup, but comfortable for eating there."}
{"text":"Lamb Kabob was tiny cubes of meat and very little rice. One small triangular piece of pita bread soaked underneath the soggy salad."}
{"text":"Just got back from Vegas for my brothers wedding.  We had our practice dinner here as we are Persian. We had 48 people in attendance. Food was Phenomenal.  No exactly Persian, but very similar. Kabob had a little spice to it, which made it perfect. It was very reasonably priced in comparison to other Persian food restaurants in Vegas.   If your in Vegas, go here. The Owners were very accommodating, helpful, courteous, and kind.  Thank you very much."}
{"text":"Wow......This place is the bomb. Have been here three times. Now have an addiction to the chicken kabob, with brown rice. Put this place on your must do list. Peace out."}
{"text":"I couldn't give this enough stars - the beef kabobs are always tender and juicy and the cilantro sauce is divine.  They also sprinkle some (homemade?) spices on top that are also outstanding."}
{"text":"So I visited this restaurant twice while I was in Vegas. I love Afghani food so yelp came to the rescue. First time, I tried Chicken Kabob Tika  and the other time, Lamb Chops. Both were great but if I have to order again, I would opt for Lamb Chops. The owners/staff were helpful and service was quick."}
{"text":"Great place in Las Vegas this  is the right stop for great and wonderful afghan food for you or your friends or family I recommend it because no where else you can fine the best afghan home made best food you love this place and the prices are great
Thanks"}
{"text":"To sum it up in one word: delicious! I decided to grab a beef kabob teka to go for lunch today at work and I am thankful that I did. Both the beef and rice were perfectly seasoned and tender. Nice, family owned business with great food!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food! The quality of the lamb was better than most restaurants. It was so reasonably priced and they served massive portions. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Yum! New lunch spot next to CSN Sahara West Center.  Convenient location after signing up for an English or HSE class! I enjoyed the #3 chicken with rice & salad."}
{"text":"This is by far the best afghan restaurant in Vegas, this is my favorite spot from now on, family owned I think, clean place. And great great food, if you are looking for amazing food this is the place. 
And prices are not that expensive either."}
{"text":"I just ordered my first dish at Pro Kabob. My taste buds are thrilled perfectly spiced and tasty ingredients, fresh delicious chicken and perfectly cooked and seasoned brown rice. I'm already impatient to return for my next meal. I only wish they make a Greek Salad with this nice flavor balance. Also they really need a vegetarian choice. 

Gracious hosts, they served us a cup of hot tea they really should put on the menu. The cuisine matches their price point. Could use something other than cable tv in the background but at least it's a food and travel channel. 

We need to support these family owned eateries. Eating here is not charitable though. You'll enjoy it."}
{"text":"Giving it 5 stars because the owner will make sure you leave the place happy. If you have any concerns. Address them and Walid will find a resolution right then and there. The chicken skewers was delicious, not a big fan of the lamb though"}
{"text":"To start with:
Cleanliness: 5 
Food taste: 5
Presentation of food :5

Overall, the food at this place is so delicious. The picture below is my dish which is beef qeema kabob and it was delicious. My husband ordered lamb chop and he wanted more. I cannot disagree with other 5 star ratings. If you're out of town like me and want to check out afghani food, then make a trip here."}
{"text":"Newly opened ...it's a hidden gem. We originally wanted to try Peru chicken but they're out of chicken so we saw the kabob place in the same center and decided to give it a try! My husband and I both ordered chicken and beef kabob teka and fell in love with this place....Chicken and beef are super moist. Highly recommended to anyone and trust me you won't regret it! I will be back to try their lamb chop ...owner recommended"}
{"text":"Great food that was cooked to perfection. The people working there are very friendly. A great place to go for Afghan food."}
{"text":"We visited pro kebab based on the yelp reviews during our recent stay in Las Vegas. We couldn't be more pleased with our dinner tonight from the minute we walked in the door we were so impressed with their hospitality as if we were going home to eat dinner. The food was spectacular and we will definitely visit again and it was extremely affordable!!!"}
{"text":"Best kabob in town, I wish I could give more stars! This is authentic afghan food, great choices and great food, I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Great food !!!! Definitely a repeat place. Happen to be in the area and tired it. It was a great decision!!!"}
{"text":"This is my 5th time eating at this restaurant! I absolutely love the food here. Very clean atmosphere and perfectly spiced foods. I always order the bolani and mantu as appetizers and as an entire my favorite are the chicken teka & lamb chops!! The staff is wonderful, I love the tea they give you when you're dining in. Food is brought out in a timely manner and presented well. I usually order takeout from here whenever I have friends or family coming over for dinner and I am on a time crunch because the price is great for the portion of foods you are receiving. Definitely recommend this place for a quick bite or group gathering!"}
{"text":"The food is okay but it's not persian. If you are looking for persian kabob then go somewhere else. 
This is afghan food."}
{"text":"Poppin' Persian food in an otherwise pretty vacant shopping plaza- traditional eats, low prices, and friendly service found here at the corner of Sahara and Valley View. Menu has about 10 meal options, with bottled and fountain beverages.

#4 Lamb Kabob Teka includes a heap of soft rice, seasoned with spices and topped with shredded carrots and raisins, similar to a biriyani, as well as a small side salad and a piece of pita. The highlight is obviously the lamb, a small but delicious portion of nicely seasoned and perfectly medium-rare meat. 
#6 Mantu is a traditional steamed beef dumpling dish topped with a mix of sauces, including a yogurt/sour cream, a red (tomato based?) sauce, vegetables, and fresh cilantro. Skins were nicely cooked and held up, filling was ample, flavors were homey and comforting. I'm not familiar with dumplings in Persian cuisine, but it would be cool to see if these could be offered pan-fried to nicely crisp and blister the skins for even more flavor.

Restaurant seems to be family owned and operated, location is clean. The lady who helped us during our visit was very polite and helpful. Looking forward to coming back for more lunch specials until I make my way through the whole menu!"}
{"text":"It's a little hidden gem due to the location. For that reason though you'll always have good parking and you can skip the crowds plus you'll get incredible tasting food, excellent pricing and fast friendly service."}
{"text":"Food is ok and definitely not PERSIAN.
If you are craving Persian kabob go somewhere else. It's not even close to Persian kabob."}
{"text":"WE LOVED IT!  We will be coming back.  We have been looking for a place that has good Mantu, and we found it! I was a little disappointed that they didn't have beef Mantu, but they suggested to try the vegetable Mantu, and to my surprise I loved it! I'm not a fan of vegetables, but it was fantastic! It is a small casual place, nothing fancy, so if your looking for that this isn't the place. If your looking for great food and good portions. It is definitely worth going!"}
{"text":"Best Persian food in town HANDS DOWN. Great genuine service. Low prices for high portions. I will be eating here everyday."}
{"text":"Great place to eat and the food is really really good. Price is right and service was great.  Waleed the owner was very nice had a smile on his face and was pleasantly nice 
I would recommend the place for families that like to eat good food and on a budget. 
Food was Fresh every time we been there"}
{"text":"The best Kabob in Town specially nahari I'm  in love with their food don't be confused What should I eat everything is delicious and taste good just choose one."}
{"text":"This is a gem of a place. It is tucked in a strip mall but thanks to Yelp, my husband and I discovered this excellent Persian restaurant. We had the Lamb Kabob Teka and the special of the day, Nehari. It is stew cooked for hours in a cast iron pot with the most delicious combination of spices.  No leftovers today.  We completed the meal with steaming hot green tea with cardamon and a slice of a pistachio dessert."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a snack and three of us split chicken kabob and the Boolani. The chicken had a fantastic flavor and the Boolani was a little spicy but all three of us loved it! Would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Hi i just went to this restaurant, and belive me it had some of the tastiest food i ever had! I suggest it to everybody i know!"}
{"text":"My 1st time here was 2 weeks ago, after my CSN interview. Owner Walid's wife was serving me & said I could pay after my meal. My husband had Lamb Kabob & I had Beef Kabob. We only realized that we had not paid when we were already on the freeway OTW home. At the same time, I received a message that I got the job, so I called Walid that I would be coming back to pay him. Today, I am back for the 2nd time here. I enjoy conversations with Walid. I told him that he should collect payment after orders, not meals. He & his wife operate the business on trust, but it's not recommendable, imho. Today, I wanted typically Afghan, so I ordered Qabeli Paolow & Boolani. Heavenly delicious."}
{"text":"Authentic Afghan food!! We found this place while visiting Vegas. Coming from NY and being afghan, we have tried many places. The mantu was amazing! Best lamb chops, so soft and full of flavor! Can't forget the green chutney! Finally a place who has the authentic Afghan chutney. So happy we found this place, will be back next time in vegas."}
{"text":"This is now one of my favorite Persian restaurants in town. If you're looking for delicious authentic Persian food, this is the place to go.  Everything you've heard is 100% true and then some!"}
{"text":"Love Kabobs, then make your way over here. The lamb was super tasty with really great middle eastern flavors. The beef stew and the soup it was is was so good I ended up spooning it all over my rice. 

I was so hungry I forgot to take pictures."}
{"text":"I rarely give reviews but this place is awesome. Now, I am jaded towards the Chicken Kabob (because I don't eat red meat) but I took a colleague & he loved the Ground Beef Kabob. The menu is small but it all seems delish. I highly recommend this place and their Avocado Hot Sauce is amazing. Try it out. It's seems like a small, family owned restaurant and it definitely needs local support! If you want one of the best Kabobs in town, try out Pro Kabob."}
{"text":"Great kabob
They had clean tables and lots of space.
Since we were a group of 6 they gave us a discounted price. 
They have a great home made yogurt drink (Doogh)"}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic! Your drink comes with the meal. Great steak, chicken, and veggie dishes. The lamb here is especially delicious. They marinate all their meat well, and know how to properly cook it. I was very impressed with the variety and quality of the food. In a strip mall location, not a very fancy place at all. Otherwise, it could be a five-star place."}
{"text":"It's a quick bite place but you still have a variety of options. We came in a group of four at 7pm on Tuesday and there wasn't a wait at all.
We tried the chicken kabob with seasoned rice, the beef kabob with white rice, and the lamb chop with seasoned rice, and veggie dumplings. They all turned to be very wonderful with a decent portion and nice flavor. I personally prefer the seasoned rice than the white rice. Highly recommend it if you wanna try authentic Persian food!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place - my girlfriend did too. I went here based on a Las Vegas Weekly Review. The cover of the article said \"Afghani dumplings\" and I am a sucker for dumplings and dumpling-like food stuff - be it potstickers, wontons, gyoza, kreplach, etc. 

The article was talking about the mantu. They were beef with a really good yogurt and tomato sauce with some other vegetables floating around. Definitely tasty and the yogurt tasted really good with the meat and tomato.

We also tried a beef kabob and another chicken kabob plate to share. These were also suggested by the article and they were good suggestions. The chicken had a nice crispiness and the beef was tender. Both were seasoned well. We got one plate with the plain, white rice and another with the brown rice with carrots and raisins (it had some local name but I'm not going to try and remember it). Both of the rices were good but the one with carrots and raisins was the definite standout and overwhelmingly favored by my girlfriend.

The green sauce they give you is a great with a nice spiciness. Another reviewer called it \"cilantro/avocado\" - sure we'll roll with that. Whatever it was, it was tasty.

Finally, my girlfriend got the yogurt drink. For real, that slop was straight nasty! It tasted like a pureed version of a cucumber salad that I make. The cucumber salad I make is great, but I don't want to drink it. However, I'm not really letting this affect my rating. It was only $2 and the rest of the food more than made up for the initial misstep. And, I'm sure someone likes that drink. I mean, the same kind of person who takes cold showers and may or may not burn small animals...but someone, right?

I would definitely eat here again. I only don't give a 5-star not because of the restaurant itself but because if everything gets a 5-star (what should represent perfection or, at least, near-perfection) then it dilutes the rating system."}
{"text":"Asked for Carrots & Raisins on top of the yellow rice but didn't get it !?! Avocado sauce is taste different than before. Mixed meats is doesn't look like 2 different meats in there"}
{"text":"The bread is much better now!  They also lowered their prices (all entrees no longer come with a drink.) CHECK THEM OUT!"}
{"text":"We found this place on yelp and checked it out for dinner tonight. Gotta say the food was great and service was excellent! Will be a regular place for us."}
{"text":"Food is really tasty, the place is quiet and relaxed atmosphere,  but there is no appetizer or dessert menu."}
{"text":"This place is bomb. Looks sus but it's not. Super tasty, fast service, clean food, reasonably priced. I was legit impressed. I order from here all the time. Fire."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. I think my expectations were a bit too high, but I still enjoyed the food.

The menu is a bit sparse, but I understood after walking in that it is meant to be a fast-casual dining establishment. Interior is small and simple, but you can dine in if you so choose.

Service is fine, and prices are average. Food is solid, but I do wish they had more offerings. I just had Afghan food recently in Northern California, and I have had Persian food countless times, so it was difficult for me to pick out any particularly special dishes here."}
{"text":"The most flavorful and juicy chicken kabob I've ever had. The seasoned rice was delish- a mix of savory and exotic flavors. Side of spicy green herb sauce was also perfect on top."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service and food. The softest beef kabob I have had in my life. Thanks

- Said"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem! Pro Kabob Persian Restaurant is tucked away in a vacant complex near the corner of Sahara and Valley View. The google direction is not very accurate. It is in the shopping center where Carl's Jr and Sprint are located. This place serves authentic Afghan food. 

The place is clean and casual with some seatings. It is family owned and operated. 

We found this place through restaurant.com but they don't take the gift certificate anymore. The owner is nice and friendly and gave us teas and deserts for the inconvenience.

Lamb chops only $12.99 was well-seasoned with cumin, each of the three pieces are nicely seared, bursting with juicy flavor of meat inside. The kabob plates came with salad, pita bread and delicious pilaf with raisins and shredded carrots.

The housemade traditional (chatni gashneez)--an acidic cilantro/vinegar chutney was amazing.

The prices on the menu were very affordable with big portions. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This isn't a Persian food place at all.. 
Their food is Afghan and has Afghan taste and flavors to it. I think it's unfair and very misleading to say they have Persian food. I came there with the impression of tasting Persian/Iranian food. Very disappointed. You guys should change your name to Afghan food"}
{"text":"Yes!! Another place in the area I can eat healthy and delicious.
This place is Afghan, not Iranian so the taste is a little different. 
I asked the owner what's the healthiest on the menu. He said everything on their menu is healthy. Their beef is lean, their lamb is lean and their chicken is chicken breast. I decided to go with the chicken kabob teka. (Nothing is leaner than chicken breast, right?)
Wow, it was absolutely delicious!! Came with a little salad, a grilled tomato, pita bread and a lot of rice. Even though the chicken was breast (white meat), it was not dry at all. How did they make chicken breast so tender and juicy?! Their avocado sauce was nice and spicy. I liked it. They use special rice in this place. It's some sort of special Afghan rice they pay $60 for 40 lbs. (gasp!! Really??) The rice was seasoned well and flavorful with raisins and shredded carrots but it was way too much rice. I couldn't finish it. I would rather have more salad than the rice since I'm trying to eat healthy...
The owner, Waleed was a very nice guy. They have a couple of lady employees here (his wife?) and they are from Afghanistan. Hope they get more business... When I came here, I was the only one eating in at 12:30 pm. (Well, it was Monday though.)
It was nice to know they have catering service here!! I'll be back soon :-)"}
{"text":"Amazing, amazing. I always order the chicken skewers. I am a guy who mostly tries to eat organic and that chicken seriously tastes organic. I know it likely is not because they don't market it as such; but that chicken is so firm and fresh and does not taste frozen at all. The seasonings they use are second to none and are just perfect. I love this place!!"}
{"text":"Food is very good, service and atmosphere really poor. Best to get take out. The rice and beef kabob was really off the charts."}
{"text":"This IS food done RIGHT. We had several items on the menu & everything tasted fabulous. The flavors can together very well. Thank you."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Had the Shami kabob and the Lamb kabobs and the lamb was very moist and flavorful. The shami kabob was something I've never tried before, seasoned ground beef mixed with veggies and deep fried and it was very good. The pilaow rice was also quite good. The owner, Walid, gave us a free sample of Mantu, beef filled dumplings and they are a must try. Great friendly service and will definitely eat there again"}
{"text":"Love the family vibe in there and the great pride they take in making their dishes! Little too much salt for my taste, otherwise a nice new spot to jump in for a little Mediterranean taste."}
{"text":"Wow, I was not expecting such good food in Vegas! We ordered a lot of food and everything was great.  The Bolani was very tasty and my husband loved the qabili palao. I loved the eggplant! Will definitely go back next time we're here!"}
{"text":"I went here with a group of friends who recommended it for a quick, delicious stop for lunch. I was not disappointed. I and a friend had the shami kabob with fries and two others had the chicken kabob tika and beef kabob tika. All were excellent!  The chicken was wonderfully marinated and the shami kabob was fried to perfection. Will definitely be coming back again."}
{"text":"Great food, I ate this Resturant and I ordered kabob beef with brown rice, it was great, I took one point only because I retuned to the Resturant the next day and he refused to use my American Express and I said I used it yesterday and he mentioned that we were not supposed to, I decided to leave the Resturant, this made it a lousy experience."}
{"text":"The lamb chops were the best, tender & juicy. Very flavorful! 
Also had the khoobideh and chicken kabob plate with kabulai polaw. Everything tasted delicious and fresh."}
{"text":"Today was either Afghan Chicken Kabob or Peruvian Chicken.

Peru Chicken was empty so I walked past it and went straight to Pro Kabob few meters away.  A couple was just walking out the door when I walked in and found few guys waiting for their orders (to go) and a group of guys seated waiting for their food to be served.  The place was clean and very unassuming.  I assumed the owners/chefs were the couple behind the counter.  

Their menu is very simple and straightforward and reasonably priced.  I ordered (to go) the Chicken Kabob which came with a huge serving of pulao (or palaw),  lettuce with avocado dressing, grilled half tomato, obi naan,  and a decent serving of well marinated, perfectly cooked juicy chicken (breast) cubes.  I personally enjoyed the pulao, the afghan pilaf.     It was on point!  It was perfectly seasoned with herbs and spices, mixed in with fried raisins and shredded carrots. And with their serving portion, I could've easily just ordered it sans chicken and still enjoyed it.  I assumed the meat was marinated in yogurt so it came out very tender, moist and juicy.  

The wait, however, was bit long. Well, i waited almost half an hour.  Though  I  appreciate the male owner/chef coming out when they handed me my food and apologized for the long wait.  

I would definitely come back and try their beef kabob, bolani (their version of quesadilla) and mantu (dumplings)."}
{"text":"I love the food as eat kaboli polo feel I am I haven very delicious food and friendly owner you just feel home I"}
{"text":"Delicious. Friendly service, clean, and conveniently located. Decent pricing.  Great place for date night or family meal."}
{"text":"Ordered a couple of orders of kabobs. Place looks like a fast food place. The best thing was the rice the rest was just blah! They don't have hummus or any other salads. I probably would not return to eat here."}
{"text":"This food is so delicious. The people are helpful and friendly. They have daily specials. We had soup. Kabobs. Boolani. The spices used were so wonderful. Very Exotic and affordable."}
{"text":"By far one of the best Afghan/Persian food in Las Vegas. Had the pleasure of eating here probably 5 times and everytime it's been exceptional. If your in the Las Vegas area I would definitely recommend this place. The staff is also great. Great portions"}
{"text":"Full disclosure, I'm one big sucker for middle eastern food( sorry for the over generalization!) particularly lamb chops! I've had lamb chops at dozens of places around town and have come to expect paying a high price for good lamb chops. Well, that changed today! Not going to lie, I was torn between this joint and the Peruvian Chicken around the corner but I'm so glad I chose this restaurant. Its a newer restaurant so it wasn't very busy but I'm sure that will change very soon! 

Ok enough background and onto the real beef( or lamb?). Very simple menu and decor, but very friendly staff. I, of course, went for the lamb chops priced at only $12.99! Immediately I began preparing my taste buds for dry over cooked chops. I even ordered it to go just in case I couldn't finish it because it was bad lol Nothing against this place but I didn't expect much for the price. When I received the order, I could literally see the juiciness from the chops and the rice smelled fantastic! I dug in and within a few minutes it was all gone! It was that good! They were juicy and tender and paired so well with the rice and cilantro green sauce. All for $12.99! 

I will definitely return and try different items but for now, the chops are definitely top three! Try it and I'm sure you'll be equally impressed."}
{"text":"Came here with the family after a long day on the strip the food was good a little to much oil for my taste but you should try it for your self."}
{"text":"First time ordering from them. Loved the food. My daughters are a bit picky when tasting new dishes but this one they loved."}
{"text":"Typical afghan that don't know how to run a business lets see how long u are still open"}
{"text":"This place is amazingly good. The food reminded my wife and I of home. They give you a good amount of food for a very good price. If you are in Vegas and want delicious food come here you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I'm a picky eater but I'm always willing go try new spots.  Ofcourse, I checked yelp...  it never let's me down.  Food was delicious I'll be coming back next time I'm in town.  The meat was super juicy and tender.  So much food for a reasonable price.  The staff was very friendly and welcoming which is a plus."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating Afghan food. I'm not sure if it was because I was so hungry but it was so delicious. I had the ground beef kabob and my husband had the chicken kabob. Both were very tasty and tender. Loved the spicy green cilantro sauce."}
{"text":"We popped in by chance and loved it. We both had the vegetable mantu. And the service was friendly too."}
{"text":"What a great find. Very affordable and outstanding service. The food was delicious and large portion. Plenty of parking space; convenient located off Sahara. 
The owner was ver pleasant, our food was prepared as we ordered. 
My family and I had an outstanding time and we will be returning again to try the other meals."}
{"text":"Perfect in every way! The spices, the tenderness, the doneness. My oh my! The portions are super-generous, and the price is amazing. Wow! It also does not hurt that the people there are very nice and friendly. Will definitely be added to my favorites."}
{"text":"This restaurant is fully halal menu. 
So before going to the strip boulevard, we decided to have a big meal, a very nice meal.

Searched on Zabihah app, I found this restaurant and decided to give it a try. The restaurant is a mix between Middle Eastern, Afghani, and Persian food. I took chicken plate from this place, my friends a combo between chicken and beef. 
The food came, and it completely made us silent because of the tastiness. The food was really delicious and I consider it a (worldwide performance) restaurant.
The prices are high (well, its Las Vegas, and the taxes.. etc) but the food worth every penny, every dollar.

Absolutely coming back again to this restaurant, and I recommend everyone to try it."}
{"text":"Great food!!! It was so delicious food 
Great customer ship!!! They were so friendly very clean place I love it so much"}
{"text":"Omg

What can i say i lovee all types of cuisines specially KABOB went in ot wasnt quite busy i dont know why?? If the food here is sooo freaking good!! I definitely recommend i have the chicken and beef kabob teka omg so delicious the rice bomb!! The sauce so sooo everything is just a 10 star i am definitely going back :)"}
{"text":"My wife and I really like this restaurant. It's on Sahara, but it's not obvious to find as you drive by. It's in a partially-vacant shopping center, set back from the street. The decor is sparse and clean. With that in mind, it's absolutely worth going in and trying the menu. Their kebobs are deliciously spiced and really savory. Most meats are served with a side of spicy cilantro sauce, which amplifies the flavor of everything. The seasoned rice is fantastic. The owner and staff are unfailingly friendly. If you want a real treat, try the lamb chops for dinner. They're outstanding!

They have a small menu, which really means they're focused on what they do best. Everything looks and tastes like it's homemade. Most of it is traditional, but they have a few American fusion items too - like the delicious kebob philly sandwich. The prices are quite reasonable. 

We're the kind of people that love little locally-owned places. Pro Kebob is perfect for that. We will keep going back."}
{"text":"We wanted to try some Middle Eastern food and this place popped up on Yelp.  We sampled a variety of food and grazed a little of everything.  Someone in out party who is more familiar than I about Middle Eastern food, made the selection.  Sorry,  I don't know what all the food was, but the spices and flavors were great and very tasty.   It's worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Loved their food so much. We took the lamb chops and lamb kabobs plates to go. First of all, finding a persian place that has no lamb mixed with beef is difficult but these guys had it. It had all the reasons we  love Persian food; just lamb, cooked to perfection, economical and filling portions. Would have liked the lamb to be cooked a tad longer though but that's completely fine. Hope to come back to the sin City some day again to eat here!"}
{"text":"Best kabobs in Vegas hands down! The owner is a really friendly guy and the food speaks for it self! Great quantity and the quality is AMAZING! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent kabobs and their rice and homemade sauce are outstanding. These were the best kabobs I've had in Las Vegas. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The food was very good and authentic!  The owners greeted us to make sure all was great, super impressed.  We will definitely be back and refer to all."}
{"text":"Walked in here for lunch because I was craving Persian food. Menu is very simple easy to read and the prices are reasonable.

I ordered the Beef Kabob Teka, Lamb Kabob Teka and the Mantu. For drinks they offer fountain drinks, can sodas or bottled water.

The gentleman who took our order was really nice. He was very helpful and made sure any questions I had was answered. He described well what was on the dishes and which items on the menu were the customers favorite. 

Food came out in a decent amount of time. I first tried the Mantu which was beef dumplings steamed cooked. The presentation was beautiful and the taste was incredible. I really enjoyed the sauce.

The Beef Kabob Teka has beef marinated with spices and cooked on skewers. They give you a lot of rice and fresh salad on the side. The beef was really tender and they give you a good amount of meat to be satisfied.

The Lamb Kabob Teka has the lamb marinated with spices and cooked on skewers also. It came with plenty of rice and vegetables. I really enjoyed the taste of lamb and would definitely get this dish again."}
{"text":"It is an awesome place to eat! Yummy Afghani Food and great service. Thank you so much for the great service!"}
{"text":"From out of town. Found this place on yelp and gave it a shot. For a place that was empty, the food was really good priced and tasted great! Would recommend!"}
{"text":"It was the best kabob in town and the boolani was delicious I totally recommend this place."}
{"text":"Nice little place.  Food is very good.  Service is also good as well.  Owners are very friendly.  But the menu is VERY limited.  That's why this nice little place gets 4 not 5 stars from me.  If I'm in that part of town and am in the mood for good kabob then I'll return."}
{"text":"Great for casual eating with an easy to order menu.

Awesome price/proportion ratio.

If it's your first time and you like chicken try the #3. 

Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Great lamb chops !!!great service!! Fresh food!!!

{"text":"Love it love it !!!!!!!
Was amazing !!!!!!!! Food was delicious Fresh to much for describe .. my opinion best place in Vegas... service incredible"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and great service as well! Highly recommend the lamb kabob teka as well as the boolani with squash!"}
{"text":"Eh, it was okay. Lady at the counter was rude. Food was basic. We had the lamb chops and Qabeli pulao which was def not authentic. Also had to make sure they were halal/Zabiha because it is not advertised anywhere in the resturaunt. Also they didn't have any ice in fountain drink machine so customers have to buy bottled water or soda from the fridge which I think is just being dishonest. 
Ambiance: the place was dead during rush hour (around 2 pm). I'd give this place another try for their other types of kabobs but won't have high expectations."}
{"text":"Great spot for some tasty kabob meats and delicious soft rice. Price was competitive, the atmosphere was relaxed. Will likely be back here again."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Chicken Kabob plate and use the house green sauce on it is my recommendation."}
{"text":"Good food. Nice people. The beef tikka is definitely juicy and delicious. Bolanee is also fresh and yummy. The dough is prepared fresh, filled with potato or squash stuffing and seared. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"After a slight miscue with a restaurant.com certificate, the owners made things good and things got even better when the food hit the table.

I got the lamb kabob ($10.99) and my date got the chicken kabob ($8.99).

Both the lamb and chicken were perfectly flavored and extremely tender. The saffron rice was a total hit with shredded carrots and raisins on top...exactly how it should be. 

The star of the show was the homemade cilantro/avocado dressing in the bottle that they bring out with your meal as it compliments the dish perfectly. It's great with the rice, great with the salad and outstanding with the lamb. I'd dip chicken wings and sushi in that sauce if the culinary world would allow.

Persian food, in general, is a healthy alternative I often overlook and Pro Kabob does it as well as anyone for a very reasonable price.

Don't overlook this place."}
{"text":"Delicious food! So glad Yelp suggested this place to me. Got the ground beef kebab which did not even need the green sauce! But I loved the green sauce too :) I usually don't eat much rice but I could've had the rice on its own as a separate meal.

The restaurant was very clean and well kept and They also have comfy seating. Will definitely be coming back again soon."}
{"text":"Very good food!  I ordered the beef tika and both the beef and the rice are delicious!  Will definitely order again when I visit Las Vegas next time."}
{"text":"This restaurant was a wonderful find in Las Vegas. Don't judge this book by its cover and go inside. The food was fresh and very tasty. Service with a smile and pride in their food. I will definitely be back when I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"Friendly service awesome food, very warm and nice people. The Bolani is amazing, and so is the lamb kabob! You can't beat it, Waleed and his family are awesome great service, awesome food!"}
{"text":"I returned on my next I noticed the quality of the beef was better more tender than the last time. The meat was a bit chewy but this time I could tell the quality of the beef is better they're using a better cut of meat and tender. 

I wanted also to try the boolani in the pics with the greens but they told me that In Vegas they can't acquire the the greens that is actually used, in that type of boolani. So we stuck with the original boolani with potatoes and onions and spices. 

Also I was a bit disappointed in the fact that both times  I came here they didn't put shredded carrots and raisins like the pics. I know from talking to my Afghani friends that the raisins and carrots are traditional way of serving the rice. So I hope the next time or just hopefully they are consistent like  the pics.  

Overall not bad the flavors are there"}
{"text":"I came accidentally to this place and guess whaaat??? -it was one of the best lunches in my life!
I've picked chicken kabob teka, the dish was delicious and the plate is pretty big.
In addition to great meal I've been enjoying the family business atmosphere- I appreciate a lot this part in restaurant business! Generally, if you want to enjoy real authentic Persian dishes- Pro Kabob is the place number one in town."}
{"text":"Best kabob ever, delicious and tasty! I totally recommend it, the rice is my mom cooking no different  also the staff are so friendly."}
{"text":"I've tried Moroccan food and tried Persian food, this was actually Afganistani food and it was grrrrreatttt!

In the summer desert heat in Vegas (on West Sahara Ave haha) it was like eating traditional Afgan food without having to travel there!  And the owners were really friendly. 

Tried the Beef Kebob Teka which was really flavorful and cooked on a kebob and came with this rice side that was really good.  Mild, suble taste but the raisins (I think) gave it a unique flavor!

Also had the Boolani vegetable pancake which came with unlimited Avocado sauce.  It was a little spicy but loving avocados, it was fine.  

And lastly had the Mantu vegetable dumpling.  It's usually beef but they said they could prepare it vegie which was really good!  The dumplings sat in a curry type sauce which reminded me of Thai curry not not quite.

Anyway, this place is a winner and the owners are really nice.  If you want something different with great value - check out Pro Kebob - only 10 minutes off the strip!"}
{"text":"Great food. You have to check this place out.

Ambience could be a little bit better. 

Daily specials have nihari and stuff which is a plus."}
{"text":"Very tasty food...lamb kabob was perfect. Clean place and welcoming host."}
