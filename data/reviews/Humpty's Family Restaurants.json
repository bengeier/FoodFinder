{"text":"The food, service and parking were pretty good. It's always so nice and makes a big difference when the wait staff will be a little friendly with you and chit chat a bit when time permitting as this always influences the tip I will or not leave and even help you order off the menu."}
{"text":"Where to start. So basically and old old friend went here for a late night Stampede dinner. So we walked in and the waitress was really rude and slammed the plates down like she didn't give a hoot. Then I was like whoa and I had the porgies witch where dried and had a sliver of hair on it so I said nicely please take this back and have some one look at the hair so the waitress was like do I look like a bar or a fancy restaurant waitress and I was like ok whoa so We got our bills and I gave no tip. My old friend did she had an ok experience but thats just that! I wont be coming back here again. again mixed reviews on other peoples parts thats fair. The interior was dirty looking and old looking ew. The outside of the building looks tired and has had its days!! Thats all"}
{"text":"Escaping the lovely snowfall, I came in here on a cold winter morning. Nothing overly remarkable, service was fast, food arrived fast.   Only ever order Breakfasts in Humpty's personally, so once again that's what I had here. Only gripes were that the beef sausage was a little tasteless and the bacon was so overcooked it was closer to pork rinds. Other than that it was just standard forgettable breakfast. Not bad but nothing to write home about. (Wait a minute, aren't I writing about it now?!)  All in all. Average. Which sometimes that's all you need when you are trying to escape the cold and are peckish."}
{"text":"I don't know why I go here. It has very watery coffee and overall very bland food. The only thing I like is that they have an option of perogies instead of hasbrowns for breakfast. I had the huerve ranchero breakfast today. I burnt the inside of my mouth because there were beans inside that were about 50 degrees hotter than the rest of the dish. Kids menu is good. They do offer smaller sized menu items on nearly everything for light eaters.   I will go back if I have no food in the house on a Friday night when kids eat free. I'd recommend the smittys nearby right next to walmart on mcleod trail instead."}
{"text":"I only gave one star because I had to. This place should be shut down.. I normally wouldn't even write a review however I feel the need to warn people in advance before consuming that mess that they call FOOD. The hollandaise was transparent. Literally clear with NO FLAVOUR. My boyfriend got a side of tomatoes that had no colour, it honestly looked like they had been sitting out for 2 weeks. The sausage that he got looked absolutely disgusting. The perogies were barely warm and had most likely been made a week before. I am actually angry at myself for attempting to eat that GARBAGE. I feel ill. Please do yourself a favour and never ever go there. GROSS!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow, some of the worst service ever!!! Went for breAkfast at 11 o'clock not busy at all, food was cold when delivered, was only able to get one refill on my coffee as the waitress never came by, and now sitting with dirty dishes for over 10 minutes and still not sign of the waitress!!!  Never again would I come back!!"}
{"text":"Nice breakfast joint; can't walk in with high expectations.. Menu is similar to Denny's, not many healthy choices on the menu. This location seems under staffed all the time and 1 person is serving 7-10 tables."}
{"text":"it is what it is. a 24 hour breakfast mega restaurant on a busy road.  the food was ok, about what you'd expect from a similar establishment. nothing better, nothing less.  the menu was over the top. nothing is a la carte. it's all rather complex, but the service will permit you to get plain items as well.  our server was hilarious and quite endearing.  again, if you need breakfast at 5 am before work or after a binge, this could be a relied upon asset."}
{"text":"So easy and convenient! The food is made fast and coffee never stops. I love their renovations, it really spruced up the space. The ladies here are friendly and curteous."}
{"text":"I used to go to Humpty's all the time, my favorite was the old 17AVE SW location, but that was closed years ago.  Humpty's used to have the best service, best value and great food.  Over the years it has consistently gone down hill and you can tell by how empty they are.  3AM after work on MacLoad used to be packed and the food and service was great.  Now it's dead, the food is bla and the service leaves something to be desired.  The bangers are long gone which is too bad because they were my favorite, the crunchy chicken is now some weird chicken paddy that is more soggy from grease than crunchy.  The last time I went to Humpty's though has been the deciding factor that I will not return.  I ordered chicken fingers and fritters with a side of gravy and what I got was pathetic.  The chicken fingers were the exact same size of a bic lighter and I got 10 fritters and the gravy was chunky and cold.  There was more empty space on my plate than food.  Very disappointing.  Perkins will probably be the place to go with the family now.  You pay a little more but get so much."}
{"text":"I ate at this placed and found that theymeal was noty perfect buty was quite tasty. Alittle greasier than normal but good enough. They aere nott to friedly I do love humptys and thoser thigs dont bother me but theu should reveiw thier stuf. I may return if it gets better. They are on my wy toi work."}
{"text":"I haven't been to this Humpty's in years, but when I did go here, it was quite often. My friend and I used to go to St. Mary's just across Macleod Tr., so going to Humpty's just required us to cross the bridge, ie: super convenient.   This location was never really busy, so we never had to wait to be seated, nor wait long for our food. The food is pretty basic, nothing fancy, and usually you don't expect a restaurant like Humpty's to be fancy, so it was pretty good for what it was, the price was reasonable too. The service at this location was absolutely exceptional! I can't say if it still is, but the servers we had were always polite, positive, and attentive; they were definitely a big factor as to why my friend and I kept going back to this location.  The only reason I no longer go here is because my stomach will not allow me to. Ten years ago I threw up a hotdog and to this day I feel nauseous when I eat hotdogs, clearly just a psychological issue. Well I have that same psychological issue with Humpty's now, the last time I ate there my stomach was very upset with my the whole night, I texted my friend that I went with and she has the same experience I did. I'm sorry Humpty's, sometimes I dream of your food and want to go back, but then I feel sick again so I can't."}
{"text":"A great breakfast spot.    Friendly service with a varied breakfast menu.    It is not the Ritz but it is not trying to be.     Try it."}
{"text":"Stopped here on my way home from a night out with friends. I must say, even after a few drinks, I knew better then to eat anything they placed in front of me.  Eggs were in a pool of wetness, and were so runny they looked unappetizing. I mean, how can you screw up scrambled eggs. Hashbrowns were cold to the touch. They were probably sitting out all day long, waiting to be fed to someone at 1am whom they hoped wouldn't notice.. well, I noticed, and after one bite of them, they joined the eggs on my plate in the \"I refuse to eat this zone\". Next up was the bacon, the bacon was sitting in a pile of grease and I was curious as to why my cold bacon was sitting in a pool of oil, but at this point, I decided to eat the bacon.. I mean, I am a human being and not eating bacon would just be irrational. At this point, I decided if I was going to attempt to eat the untouched pancake on my plate, It would probably need lots of butter and syrup to try mask whatever taste it could potentially have, and I was surprised.. why this pancake tasted like cardboard, and no amount of butter or syrup would help. Aunt Jemima's boxed pancake mix that they feed you at childhood summer camps would have been more delicious and flavorful... so this too ended up in the \"absolutely not zone\". I did eat my side of toast. It was thick style Wonderbread and tasted delicious with peanut butter.   The service was terrible. We waited 10 minutes before someone finally got up and offered us a table. Yes, got up.. The waitress and cook were sitting at a table in plain view, drinking coffee and having an in depth conversation that they refused to pause to seat a couple of paying customers. This actually repeated itself and after the terrible food I simply got up and walked up to their table and asked if I could have my bill and a machine so I could pay and leave. They made a snide comment about \"eating too quick and not enjoying the company of the person I was with\". So incredibly unprofessional.   So yes, I gave Humpty's one star based on Wonderbread, Kraft peanut butter, and cold bacon (simply because it was bacon). I will never be going back to this \"restaurant\". The only reason I even bothered writing this review was in the hopes of saving another person from this absolutely terrible place."}
{"text":"The other day a friend suggested that we meet for breakfast at Humpty's. I have to admit, I wasn't thrilled about the suggestion, but I figured it had been a good decade since I had been there, so I'd give it another go.   I have to be honest: the menu at Humpty's was more impressive than the way I remembered it. They had everything from Eggs Benedict (In fact 6 different variations!) to burgers, and wraps to waffles.   The prices at Humpty's are reasonable and our server was pretty friendly and efficient.   The food was OK. It wasn't mind-blowing, but it wasn't disappointing either.   Overall, better than I recollected. Was it the best I've ever had? Absolutely not. But will I avoid it if someone else suggests it? Absolutely not."}
{"text":"Geez there are some rough reviews for good old Humpty's. Nope it's not fine dining and yep it's pretty bad for you but I found the service to pleasant and the food was adequate."}
{"text":"New owner is afraid of people. I was going to ask her a question and she looked like she was going to cry! The food not very good and only one waitress is any good. The rest keep coming to the table and asking questions about what we ordered. I thought that was why the wrote it down in the first place. The other day when we were in there, it was not all that busy so the owner sent one of the waitresses home. Ten minutes later they got slammed. The owner does not seem to know how to help. Never send staff home when you have stuff they can clean. Salt and pepper  shakers to fill! I have been in hundreds of resturants across Canada and the United states  This one is below average."}
{"text":"I quite enjoy that I can come here for dinner with my friends or my folks for dinner, and I can still get stuff like french toast, pancakes, eggs...and of course, bacon.  I think that's the only thing I've ever ordered here, and I've never been disappointed. Simple, straightforward food. They've added a few things to the menu recently, so, be sure to take a look the next time you are in.  This last round I had french toast with mixed berries and whipped cream. It was so very good.  Due to it's location and the likes of my friends, I suspect I'll be back."}
{"text":"Breakfast  at  dinner .. need  I  say  more .. San Antonio with bacon. .yes the coffee is subpar. Yet the servers seem generally concerned for  a good  experience."}
{"text":"I want to like this place. It is close to home and affordable. However, horrible service and horrible food make for a horrible experience.   Waited twenty minutes for a coffee refill before giving up and accepted it wasn't coming. Food was cold. Couldn't even get a water refill.   Hopefully service improves. I really do want to see this place improve."}
{"text":"May 2010 - Stopped in for lunch, ordered the quesadilla. It was served cold and soggy, almost like it was dropped in water or something. Totally disgusting. Asked for it to be returned and then ordered Beef Dip, again cold and the beef was loaded with fat chunks! By then I had given up and left only to be charged for both dishes! Will NEVER return."}
{"text":"Awful parking/be careful backing up.  Seating is tricky as the booths are pretty tight fitting except one in the corner.  The tables with chairs have uncomfortable chairs, so you can't win.  Morning servers pretty good; evening servers, not so hot and poor communicators.  The evening girls would not let us sit in the only booth that we can fit into.  So if you're 6'4\", don't go there.  Food is pretty good.  I find the coffee too strong, personally but if they supply a dish of cream I can doctor it up."}
{"text":"Humpty's is often a forgotten chain that used to specialize in eggs and breakfast. The menu has expanded to offer a more balanced selection. Right now my favourite is beef liver and you get a choice of two sides from a selection of potatoes to vegetables and salad. They do beef liver very well and offer two portion sizes. The regular portion size is always enough for two or even three meals for me. Service in the NE location off 64 Ave NE has always been great for me and I've been there about 4-5 times. Lots of parking in the lot and a nice clean environment."}
{"text":"What I learned recently about Humpty's, is that their head office is actually in Calgary.  I always feel a little warm and fuzzy when I support local.  :)  Started in Blackie, Alberta back in 1974, Humpty's is now a fair sized franchise.  Pretty cool, eh?  The breakfasts there are nothing fancy.  You won't find any sprig of parsley on the side. However,I have never had a bad breakfast there.  It is fairly consistent, and the portions are quite large.  good value for your money."}
{"text":"Service sucks, uninspired menu. Time to train your staff and rethink your menu. Never coming back again. I'll be warning all my friends about this place."}
{"text":"Humpty's has a history in Calgary. It is local and since 1977 has grown in Western Canada. The food is good here. They are known for their good service and family dining.   I'll forgo a review and say that a few years ago Humpty's released a PC video game in which Humpty was the main character in a side scrolling adventure. I don't know any other franchise that has done this.  Very innovative! Please let me know if you have this game!"}
{"text":"Ahhh....Humpty's. In the same vein as Denny's, Smitty's and Perkins, these types of diners do basic food well, pile it high and sell it at a very reasonable price. (However, as I say below, Denny's has seemed to have thinned out the portion sizes over the last couple of years)  Snobbery aimed at venues like this are missing the point. 'bacon 'n eggs' type restaurants like this, don't pretend to be anything else. *cough* Joey Tomatoes *cough*. Places like this aren't 'greasy spoons' anymore. There is healthy options on the menu. Fish, lean steak, grilled chicken, salads.  The food isn't the last word in sophistication, no. But is it filling? Yes. Is it good value? Yes. Bottomless coffee? Yes. Is it comforting on a cold winter night/morning and it will keep you going all day? Hell yes.  You can spend $8-10 on a McDonalds meal or what have you, and feel hungry a few hours later. Manage to get down the big 'Cowboy Breakfast',  however, for about the same price, your furnace is fueled for the day!   One just can't beat a big diner meal early in the morning for a long road trip.  Yes, the decor and fittings are a bit well loved and dated, but it's all in good order and appears clean, the waitresses are prompt and nice, and the coffee bottomless.  Humpty's, is my new 'comfort food' place now, that Denny's has (seemingly in certain locations) started to thin out the portion sizes. Humpty's and Perkins, still appear to give you a mound of food.  Fantastic location, open 24 hours a day.  Humpty's. It does what it says on the tin. Good job guys."}
{"text":"As far as I'm concerned places like this (smitty's, Denny's, Phil's) are for the day after a big party where people have been drinking all night or the drive back from camping. The menu items are priced extremely cheap to match the food that you are about to get. Nothing they bring is more complicated than a meal any home economics class would teach in first year high school. The service isn't great most of the time because the servers are overworked and underpaid."}
{"text":"Although not a fancy restaurant, I keep coming back. I have only ever ordered the breakfast here (if you haven't read in any of my other reviews, I l.o.v.e. breakfast) but it's pretty good for a chain restaurant. The food is fresh, they're open to suggestions for changes due to dietary considerations and I've never been disappointed. I also like the \"smaller size\" option they have available for those us with smaller appetites.   I generally stick with the omelettes or the scrambles, which are all awesome. They have 4 choices for toast (although not sourdough, which is one of my favourites).   A downside is how busy it gets, especially in the mornings on weekends. I usually go mid-afternoon to beat the rush & then I can take all the time I want to read. The service is awesome, I've never had a bad experience. On-the-ball, always refilling my coffee.  Overall, I'd recommend Humpty's to anyone who won't judge me for coming here :)"}
{"text":"And that extra star is just for the nice server who knew i wasn't happy with their so-called scrambled eggs.  she gave me a free pancake, since that's all i asked for, i'm sure 2 wouldve been possible. but not to take advantage lol.  the bacon was fine but the eggs came in perfectly shaped rectangular strips, so just didn't look natural.  the hash browns were fine.  nice booths.  free parking.  just not a repeat anytime soon."}
{"text":"We live near by so we stopped in to give it a try. The food is worse than Denny's if you can believe it.  Everything is made a week in advance so it's all stale. AVOID!"}
{"text":"Humpty's was about the only breakfast place in the city open on the holiday and without a long wait for seating. Place was empty.   Service sucked. Server was rude. She spoke quietly, didn't smile, and didn't really answer questions about the menu. After being served hash browns, my friend asked what those were, as they looked like fried potatoes, and my friend was expecting shredded or diced hash browns. I guess Humpty's calls fried potatoes hash browns, so the server simply said, \"Those are hash browns,\" and walked away. She never refilled our drinks. Never came to check on us after the food was served. My friend asked her again at the cash register why she was charged for hash browns if she didn't get hash browns, and the server simply opened a menu, pointed to a picture of their so-called hash browns, and said, \"See? Hash browns\". Needless to say, the server didn't get a tip.  Food was mediocre. Their hollandaise sauce looks and tastes like beef stock cooked in vegetable shortening. It's white and translucent. Oh, and their hash browns aren't what you would expect. The bacon was 80% fat and undercooked. Their toast is your regular packaged Wonder bread.  NEVER going back."}
{"text":"When you enter a restaurant and it has a greasy smell, LEAVE!  Today's breakfast was very greasy, likely a grill that need a good cleaning and the oil smelled like it needed changing.  I'll never return."}
{"text":"What happened to Humpty's?  It used to be a great inexpensive stop for Sunday brunch.  Today the coffee was terrible and the eggs Benedict was bland with a tablespoon of Bernaise sauce.  $3.00 for a cup of Coffee?"}
{"text":"Mediocre food with terrible service. I will not be coming back again even if I had a free coupon.   This place is just unremarkable in every sense of the food. The food was bland (I kept saying the butter was the most flavourful thing on my plate) and the service was just downright slow. I ordered the eggs in a basket and my husband got a breakfast burrito. The most flavourful thing on his plate was the sour cream.   When we came into the restaurant, it took us over 5 minutes to get seated (even though we were passed numerous times by a variety of servers) and the place was fairly empty. Then, we decided on our food quickly, but after we were given our drinks it took another 10-15 minutes for the server to come back and take our order (again we were passed by numerous other servers during this period in time.) Our food arrived farily quickly, but I cannot even remember how it tasted. Salt and pepper helped, but beyond that it was edible.  We orderd a chocholate brownie with ice cream on top in hopes that maybe their desserts are tasty. The brownie was dry and the ice cream was ALSO bland. Safe to say, I will not go here again as there are numerous other good breakfast places in the city. Honestly, IHOP or Denny's would been a MUCH better choice."}
{"text":"24-hours.  Places like this, especially after a night out is a godsend.  The food is average admittedly, but I've always found the service to be outstanding no matter what time of day or night.  But when you got the munchies at 2 am, or want an especially early breakfast, it's a great place to go.  Don't expect haut cuisine.  This place specializes in comfort foods of all sorts, at pretty reasonable prices.  Being the head office resto, as well as being right across from the Stampede grounds, I do like the Stampede posters from different years all over the place.  The snack foods are great to share with friends though I'm not a big fan of the desserts.  Their version of the Stampede Breakfast is a nice touch, as the sausage is just huge.  Otherwise, every so often, just come on down, and enjoy the company, the humble atmosphere and the history."}
{"text":"Pretty decent humptys, the one waitress we often get is quite friendly, very quick. Foods always hot, smaller restaurant than most. Not super busy place.l most times. Only problem I have is sometimes they forget to refill the little racks with ketchup and jams and sweeteners on each table. Other than that, they're great!"}
{"text":"I was here for my 18th birthday a few years ago and thought it was nice enough, but some of my then-friends were talking about the condition of the restaurant in a way that made me feel sheepish for even choosing it (though I DO remember them making an awesome poutine). So I stayed away for a little while. However, I recently went to a different location in Red Deer and discovered: yes, I am still a fan of Humpty's family-friendly charm and irresistable all-day breakfast.  There are many locations to serve Calgary and surrounding areas, just check out this link: http://www.humptys.com/default.asp?mode=webpage&id=102&provincecode=AB  Enjoy ^_^"}
{"text":"We like this location for breakfast. Humpty's doesn't pretend to be anything but what it is, so I don't expect anything fancy. A HUGE shout out to Kathy, the best waitstaff (and has been for ages!). We've been lucky to be in her section for most of our visits in the past few years. My hubby and I went with a friend last week, and everything we ordered (along with all the \"special\" requests that might drive another waitress crazy!) was delivered perfectly!"}
{"text":"we came in at 10AM, super hungry. the restaurant is pact...and there were only 3 waitreses...i can sense the stress level.  Leo had perogies supreme and i had steak and potatoes. i have been craving for steak for 2 days.lol  the price is good. the service ok. since the waitress was stressed out, i wouldnt hold the incident against her.  we finished at 11AM. yah the food was served a little longer than usual again, understandable.  the food was good. steak not as good as reef and beef but it can do. lol i would go back there and the price is ok too."}
