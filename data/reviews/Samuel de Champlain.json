{"text":"I'm staying at the Marriott and I was looking for a place to eat breakfast this morning.  On entering the restaurant in the lobby you immediately feel like you're walking into an elegant dining establishment from the 1960's.  The hostess was quite friendly and we were seated at a nice table.  My fine dining experience stopped when our meals arrived.  My friend ordered the Canadian breakfast and basically received something you would find at a $5 diner on the side of the road.  The bacon was overcooked, the eggs were overcooked, and perhaps the most traumatizing thing of all was the 'hash browns' were actually circular pieces of processed potatoes you'd buy in bulk at Costco.

I ordered a western dish that consisted of 2 poached eggs on a bed of those terrible hash browns.  I was literally in disbelief a place could charge $20 for a breakfast and serve hash browns that were processed.  The rest of my meal was loaded with salt and I could not finish it.  I've ordered room service at this hotel which is essentially the same food and I must say this place is truly a disappointment in terms of dining.  The hotel itself is ok to stay at, just do not expect any good dining experiences here."}
{"text":"JOHN CHUCKMAN REVIEW OF THE SAMUEL DE CHAMPLAIN RESTAURANT IN MONTREAL'S CHATEAU CHAMPLAIN HOTEL, A MARRIOTT HOTEL

My wife was coming home by train from a visit, and we wanted to have dinner at \"hotel style\" restaurant near Montreal's Central Station.

I had thought of the Queen Elizabeth, but its new restaurant, called Rosélys, despite eye-catching looks, is, judging from its internet site more of a bistro, a limited one, with a small menu and wines by-the-glass. Some reviews indicated poor service, too. So, we avoided it.  

So far as I know, the Chateau Champlain Hotel, with its wood-paneled lobby and central location, is regarded as pretty high-end, and one just naturally expects a fairly high-end restaurant. 

You know, the old \"hotel style\" with crisp white linen, excellent service, and very good food? We are an older couple, and we like that kind of indulgence periodically when we go out.

We know you can still find it at some Montreal hotels, notably the Sofitel and the Ritz-Carlton.

And if you look at Chateau Champlain's internet site, the picture definitely is intended to communicate that very thing.

But what a total disappointment the Samuel de Champlain restaurant is.

It was early evening, and there were only place mats on the bare tables, but we were tired and hungry and, as I say, we're not young, so who's going to start a new search in the busy evening streets with luggage in tow?

The waiter was friendly and, at first, seemed helpful, but I would have to say that through the meal he simply disappeared for long periods. 

I believe he was also working the bar/lounge next door, and that, too, is an unpleasant distraction for a dining room - a large open door to the kind of bar that has television in it. We never go into bistros or bars that have televisions blaring in them, something all too common today.

I ended pouring most of the wine myself from the ice bucket the waiter had brought. Rather odd, to say the least, going to the extent of bringing an ice bucket, but letting the customer do most of the pouring?

When the waiter did show up, he also tried to upsell us several times, and that is something unpleasant in what is supposed to be a place for fine dining. Needless to say, the \"tipometer\" was set to low by his performance.

But the main thing in a restaurant is the food, of course, and I advise readers that not only are my wife and I both excellent cooks, but I served a stint as a city's newspaper restaurant reviewer years go.

And it is in the food - likely the same stuff served in the bar - where the Samuel de Champlain restaurant stands out, as it were, as a hopeless effort that should simply be closed down.

I'll give just a couple of examples as enough to have readers understand. 

My wife's Thai soup was certainly Campbell's canned Thai soup with a couple of items added. She knows the canned soup, so there is little doubt, and, of course, if it wasn't Campbell's, then it tasted and looked exactly like it. Some culinary achievement, that.

My fancy sandwich plate contained corned beef that was so overcooked and tired and dried-out that its salt content had become more concentrated. It was unpleasant to look at, and I didn't finish it.

I find it hard to understand how any hotel management could allow this to happen. One, of course, thinks of complaining, but who wants to add creating a big scene to an already-unpleasant experience? We're not built like that, but we will never cross the hotel's threshold again, and I hope my words can inform others."}
{"text":"Pretty typical hotel restaurant, albeit a little more upscale in keeping with the atmosphere of the Château Champlain. It seems to have been renovated since the last review in 2012, so was more contemporary and inviting. Staff were friendly and very helpful, hence the fourth star. We only had the buffet breakfast here. We were in Montréal with family members who are a bit slow to move in the mornings. Going to a local bistro wasn't in the cards. Buffet wraps up at 11am and they came down at 10:45. The staff was very accommodating and didn't make them feel rushed. 

I could have done with a flaky and fresh bakery croissant, but that's not Marriott's way. The full \"American\" buffet is not bad with a variety of fruits, cereals, cold cuts, cheese, pastries, bagels and mini croissants (dry and disappointing, even Costco has better croissants), Belgian waffle station, French toast (mistakenly took a chocolate chip piece), bacon, sausage, omelette of the day (spinach and cheese was good) and scrambled eggs (sometimes a bit on the watery side). The egg wraps with salsa weren't bad. No Canadian influences here, specifically peameal bacon or poutine. The latter I don't like anyway, but good briney peameal-coated pork loin is a favourite. No smoked salmon either. My husband generally stays in Marriotts on his travels and says the buffet is the same everywhere he goes. Guess they're consistent.

Because my husband is a Platinum Elite member we were given coupons when we checked in the night before, so the buffet was only $11 each instead of $26. Not sure what the policy is for giving those out, but can always ask if any are on offer. If you just want the cold buffet (cereals, breads, fruit, beverages), that is $19.50. Full buffet is a better deal."}
