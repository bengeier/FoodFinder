{"text":"Although it was a bit expensive, it was definitely well worth the price!  Of the few indian restaurants in Brossard, it's the best. The location is extremely convenient, and the atmosphere is very charming and joyful.  We had the butter chicken, shrimp bhuna, sag paneer, simosas, onion bhaji, and fantastic gulab jamun for desert. The butter chicken was my favorite, and had one of the best tasting sauces I've ever had in my life. I definitely recommend that one!  Overall it was a fantastic experience, and I really hope this restaurant stays around."}
{"text":"To be fair the food was fantastic, I highly recommend it but \"dine in\" only.   Deliveries are done by a 3rd party service and often takes long to arrive, I have even received the wrong order."}
{"text":"Finally, an Indian restaurant that delivers, figuratively AND literally!  Brossard seems to be generating a lot of buzz around quality Indian meals (Le Tandoor and Mysore have been rated consistently well), and this new restaurant is proof in the pudding.    We ordered butter chicken, tandoori, and some vegetable dishes.  All were good, however, the butter chicken made a lasting impression.  The portion sizes are also very great since we'll have leftovers for at least another day, and our meal came with some interesting fixings such as pickled carrots and a very delicious mint/coriander chutney.  The restaurant itself is undergoing some renovations, so I'll have to review this place again to comment on the decor.    Overall, a good experience, and a welcome alternative to the regular day-in-day out delivery options."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good and good value for what we had. You have to get the mango lazzi. Will definitely going back"}
{"text":"My daughter and me had a wonderful lunch at this nice and cozy restaurant. The butter chicken and Vegetable curry were very delicious.   Price is moderate. Service is good. Cleanliness is super."}
{"text":"I've ordered from here 4 times and did take out 2 times, I suggest calling and placing your command and saying you will go pick it up in an 30 mins, because it takes over an hour for delivery. With that being said the food is the best Indian food on the south shore of Montreal. I've always taken the same thing, order CC, it's the vegetarian option and comes with 6-7 different dishes that can feed 6 people and it costs about 35$ I absolutely love it! I always order extra nan bread and from now on I will order extra onion baji because it's so good!"}
{"text":"Très bonne bouffe ! Le riz, le poulet au beurre et le buf curry étaient délicieux. Prix raisonnable et le serveur est gentil. J'y retournerais :) C'est un apportez votre vin."}
{"text":"Excellente cuisine indienne ! Nous avons retrouvé les saveurs de l'inde dans ce restaurant tres bien tenu. Décoration en accord avec la nourriture. Essayer l'agneau danksa... un régal !"}
{"text":"My go-to Indian restaurant in Brossard mainly because their butter chicken is excellent. They do dine-in, take out and delivery."}
{"text":"J'avais lu quelques critiques concernant l'horrible service. J'y allais de reculons en me disant que je n'y allais que pour une commande pour emporter, que je n'étais pas pressée.  Mes bhaji étaient chauds, délicieux. Abordables. Le service rapide, efficace, personnalisé.  Cependant, en attendant ma commande, j'ai vu quelque chose qui m'a un peu refroidi. Le serveur rapporte un plat de 3 sauces de la table qui étaient en train de manger leur repas. Je le vois remplir les plats de sauce me disant qu'il allait les rapporter à la table. Mais non, il remet les plats remplis à nouveau au frigidaire. Étaient-ils réservés pour les mêmes clients ou pour d'autres clients? Je l'ignore mais je ne prendrai pas le risque de venir manger sur place."}
{"text":"I didn't enjoy the food and I also did not receive what I ordered via delivery. They sent the wrong soup, no rice, and ignored my request to send utensils/plates/napkins. Big buzzkill when you're in a hotel room eating Indian food with your fingers. Ordered several different vegetarian dishes but really didn't enjoy them - too greasy and not flavorful."}
{"text":"Très bon rapport qualité prix. Le cadre n'est pas forcément super beau mais la cuisine est bonne et savoureuse. Le lassi à la mangue est excellent. Je vous conseille la table d'hôte A à 22$ où vous pourrez goûter différentes choses intéressantes !"}
{"text":"My husband and I are visiting from LA and decided to eat close to our hotel tonight instead of going into Montreal as we did last night. I used to work in an Indian restaurant in college and ate homemade, family style Indian food three times per week so I was hoping for authentic flavor and style, which is what I found here.  It is important to note that this restaurant is a Muslim Indian restaurant, which means no alcohol and no pork. No problem. My husband and I decided to go for a 2-person meal which included an appetizer, two entrees, rice, naan and coffee/tea. For the appetizer, we each received a vegetable samosa and pakora. As expected, three condiments arrived at the same time which included mint chutney, raita, and sliced carrots in a vinegar dressing. Our plates also had a small green salad, which added to the color and helped clear the palate.   Our entrees included chicken tandoori, which was cooked perfectly and had delicious seasoning. We also had a lamb curry, which was not spicy but very flavorful. The rice was cooked well and the naan was perfect. We ate a lot and will still have a full meal for each of us tomorrow.   We chose the chai tea, which was served after our meal. They brought it in a pot, which turned out to be four servings total. It was a nice touch that they had dropped a cardamom pod in each of our teacups.  The server was attentive and the atmosphere was satisfactory. We both felt very satisfied after this meal and felt like it was a good value."}
{"text":"Being accustomed to Indian food ourselves, we are very skeptical when ordering from Indian restaurants in our area thinking they may not be the real deal. However, the cravings for spicy food were intense and being too lazy to travel into Montreal, decided to grab a takeaway from Shaan Tandoori and give it a go.   Inside it is small and cosy with a typical 'Indian restaurant' feel and being a Friday, it was already quite full. We ordered the Special Combo for 2 to go and waited at one of the tables whilst they prepared.   I found the customer service extremely rude - I can understand that the restaurant receives many orders but the main host kept yelling on the phone that they are extremely busy and was very stressed out. After quite some wait time, we received our order, all packed neatly in a plastic bag and took it home.  I was extremely impressed by the great packaging - all items were well sealed (every Indian knows curry stains are the worst) and the portions were bigger than expected! We received pakora & samosa for appetizers, tandoori chicken, pilau rice, lamb bhuna and three condiments. The taste was really delicious, amazing flavours and very authentic!  Knocking off one star due to the terrible customer service but overall, very impressed with the food and will be ordering again!"}
{"text":"The service was really slow and even the food was okayish. It wasn't busy so this totally not acceptable."}
{"text":"Drove by here on the way home as I wanted some Asian food and it's been a while since I had some good Indian food! Totally found this place by chance and man....am I so happy I did. I use to joke around with my Indian friends that my middle name should be Sanjay because I love the spices from Indian food so much. Indian people really know the art of spice! It's no surprise that early explorers to North America were looking for a passage to the orient in search of spices!   Since some Indian places I've visited in Montreal don't understand spice very well I asked them how spicy they do their dishes. The guy at the counter told me they understand spice. So okay I ordered the table d'hôte for one person ($22.50).  It came as 2 pieces of tandoori chicken, lamb bhoona, vegetable bhaji, basmati rice, salad, naan and one gulab jamun. Everything was ordered as a medium spice. Also came with papadam 3 condiments: spiced carrots a sweet yoghurt raita and also what tasted like a mint sauce. Overall it was a great serving size and allowed for another big meal the next day! Wow... Spices were fantastic. Like an awakening in the mouth. Naan bread was crispy and doughy...just perfect. The lamb was outstanding. Tandoori chicken a bit dry but everything else makes me want to go back and place another big order. I will head back! Value is amazingggggg!   Come check this place out if you want real deal Indian at reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"Tasty indian restaurant in brossard, portions are very very  big, meal for 2 person is good for 3 or 3 1/2 person ! Really loved it, they should improve a little on their customer service and that is where i find they are loosing a star. Their packaging for take out is also A+"}
{"text":"AMAAAZIING! I cannot express how good the food was. Took my mom out here last night, we only ordered lamb biryani, chicken tandoori, shrimp bhoona and lassis. Felt like I ate twice as what I ordered, They gave us 3 kinds of condiments to go with our meals, all of the chats were really delicous including the carrot chat which I have no clue as to how they made it but only that I dont care of what and how and ITS AWESOME. The yougurt one was sweet.. a bit rather different then regular Raita but perfect if you accidentally order your food spicy. I usually stick to mild and found the food just perfect to my taste. The tandoor came with a fresh garlic nan, salad i guess on the house? And with two plates of vegetable curry. My biryani was made excellent the lamb not stale and the food had some nice twist to it that definitey set it apart then other local indian restaurants. Last I was here had only ordered lassis and appetizers so this time when I skipped straight to meals found the experience very pleasent. As always I was served by the owner who was really sweet and polite and made sure to check in on us every now and then. The vibe of the restaurant is nice, hospitality rate 5 stars and the food great. Last I ticked of a star was because I felt it was overpriced but after trying them everything was justified.   Verdict: Must must must try this place out if you dont love indian cuisine.....yet :)"}
{"text":"Petit restaurant, déco un peu vieillote, mais la nourriture est bonne et les portions sont généreuses. Nous avons eu un bon service. Bon rapport qualité /prix."}
{"text":"Bring your own booze - eat in or take out Indian food. Good stuff. Must go if you like Indian on the south shore. The price is average between 15 to 24$ per person."}
{"text":"So happy to have found a good Indian restaurant without having to cross the bridge!!! Yay! As some of you might know, I live in a beautiful area without any decent restaurants :/   So when we want to go out to eat, we usually have to drive at least 40-45 minutes into Montreal or at least closer to Montreal like Brossard and such. Well this time we drove 30 minutes to this little Indian restaurant not too far from the Champlain Mall.   I got the table d'hôte A and hubby got table d'hôte C (vegetarian). We were really surprised as to how good and spiced up the food was. From the naan bread to the rice pudding, we were happy adults! And the portions you ask? HUGE! we ended up having take-out and each got a very big lunch the next day. Service was fine. No rudeness like some critics mentioned. Probably because it was a quiet Sunday evening. The bill came up to about 50$ taxes and tips included. Cheap for all that we got and for a BYOB too :)   The only reason why I didn't give this place a five stars is because one of the condiments bowl looked sketchy (description in photo). Needless to say I didn't touch it. It made me wonder if the condiment plate was passed around or not. Besides that, I will be back!"}
