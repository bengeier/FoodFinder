{"text":"We tried Ketzal by Desert Ridge for the first time tonight and were very impressed by the friendly staff, fresh-tasting food, and comfortable atmosphere. The salsa selection was especially fun, and the chips delicious. We'll be going again!"}
{"text":"Went in with no expectations and was pleased but not blown away. The atmosphere is bright and modern but not particularly attractive. Service is prompt and attentive. The food is a little overpriced but it's good. Nice fresh chips with a platter of different salsas to start (the menu makes it seem like you have to order this, for a charge, but they must have changed their minds). The burritos and tacos were tasty, as were the refried beans (not so for the rice). All in all, If someone asked me to join them for a meal there, I'd be happy to do so, but I don't know if I'd run back."}
{"text":"The food here is different from what I expected. The queso dip was a lukewarm congealed mess of what appeared to be mozzarella cheese and watered down Alfredo. The Ketzel burrito I tried had the same watered down Alfredo type sauce on it, It was called white sauce on the menu. This \"white sauce\" is not good, and considering they drenched my poor burrito with it, as well as my friends quesadilla. The service was excellent except the table was asked how everything was by just about every employee on premises. It actually got to the point where their constant query's were a interruption."}
{"text":"There 2 good items at Ketzal.  1.  The bar!  Good selection of Tequilas.  2.  The chips and salsa sampler.  (Which is not complimentary anymore).    You have to seat yourself.   The waiter and waitress both missed on the bringing us water after we requested it.    My wife went to the bar to get water.    A third waiter brought us the water.   The drink order was wrong, but if you like free drinks......   The rice and beans are bad.  They were not even hot. Do not come here for the food.   I hope Ketzal gets a new chef before they open at 101 and Tatum."}
{"text":"I really like ketzel, for what it is. It's not super authentic but they have good food. They serve a variety of different salsas, which is unique, and their burro ketzel (with steak) is fantastic. I get it everytime. I refuse to go to all the lame chains in my area and think ketzel is a cute Mexican restaurant that offers something different, which is nice. My only complaint would be that I think they are a little overpriced and when they do send out coupons, they are pretty lame. Other then that, I like ketzel and would recommend it."}
{"text":"We were deciding between Pita Jungle and Ketzal... What was I thinking?  The food isn't the traditional Mexican fare by any means.  The salsa platter was interesting.  There was the usual pico de gallo, salsa, a runny version of guacamole, and the rest was a cream based something or other.  The chips were fresh.  I ordered the Ketzal chicken burrito with the sauce on the side.  It was good but not extraordinary.  The rice was on the drier side.  My friend had the shrimp tacos.  The shrimp was flavorful but the black beans were kind of salty.  The food is okay but not outstanding.  The difference between this place and a Rubio's, La Salsa or Baja Fresh is that well there is a bar and some mood lighting.  I wouldn't say never again but then I'm also not going to be running to the door either."}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken salad and the chicken came on top of old packaged salad.  I showed the waitress the wilted lettuce and brown spots all over and asked her if she had any fresh lettuce.  After about 6 or 7 minutes she came back with a plate full of the same packaged salad with DIRTY lettuce.  I showed her the disgistingly dirty lettuce and asked her if she would eat it.  She said no.    That's two times they brought out crap.  You would think that after the first time they would make sure they got it right the second time.    Nope.  What a disgusting mess."}
{"text":"Reeehhhhehhhh... I'm glad I went to satiate my curiosity, but probably wouldn't go out of my way to go back.   From the outside you'd really think this place was fast food, Chipotle-style. I guess that's what I was looking forward to and expecting. It's a fairly nice sit-down place with good service, a full and fancy bar, and an open and airy pretty space.   I guess for the money I was just expecting a bit more. When you pay around $11 for a burrito, you want it to knock your socks off. For around $11 you should quite literally be eating that burrito sockless.  The mahi mahi tacos were better, but needed to be snazzed up by hand as well.  I guess really this is more of a DIY non-authentic Mexican food type of place.  I WANT SOME HEAT!  I think next time I'd hop on the 17 north for a few miles and slide on over to DEL TACO OHHH YEAHHHH."}
{"text":"All day happy hour on Sunday? We decided to try it out.   The chips served with 6 different salsas: impressive. And free. And re-fill on the salsas. We were happy.  I got the taco trip: chicken, shrimp, steak. They were smaller than i expected but good. The shrimp taco was the best in flavor. I wished I had gotten three of those instead of mixing it up.   The nachos were okay, but the sight of melted cheese and sour cream atop soggy chips was unappetizing after a few minutes.   The margarita (frozen for $2.50) was pretty good actually. Tasty, strong enough and great price.   My daughter ordered the cheeseburger with fries and liked it. So that was a plus.   We will come back for happy hour to try the avocado egg rolls and a few margaritas."}
{"text":"I recently moved right across the street from KETZALS, I heard wonderful things from my friends in the area and decided to bring my little sister ( Just turned 21 in Nov ) who was visiting from Colorado ! This was the first drink me and her would have had together and should have been special ! Not so much , WE had the MANAGER , throw my little sisters Colorado state DL back at her and advised us , she didnt think it was real ... Not only did she refuse us service at 5:00 in the evening with not a drip of alcohol in us ! She THREW the Lisence back to us , said they have no scans and no blacklight to verify this ...and took the CARD back to a cook to determine the validity of this ID, After i proceed to try and get the owners information I found out the other KETZALS had been closed in Desert Ridge ( Probably due to poor managment decisions ) I would NOT recommend this place to anyone with Family visiting or ... friends ! The mamagment there should go back to school and figure out how to treat customers... tell EVERYONE you know !  Report Abuse"}
{"text":"If I could possibly give a 0 star I would.  DO NOT ever go to this so called restaurant.  It was absolutely pitiful!!!  For almost $9.00 I got the \"shrimp camarones\" which consisted of a watery milk sauce, 4- count them 4 bay sized shrimp, 4 mushrooms and a half of a bag of chips.  There were no beans and rice, nothing!  Then the owner told me that the portion was enough to feed 2 people??  Really, there wasn't enough \"food\" for a single adult, let alone two.   I am all about supporting local business, but I would have been better off going to Del Taco or Taco Bell and I would have gotten better food and we would have enough food to fill up 4 people for that amount of money. Don't waste your time or your hard earned money!!!"}
{"text":"Not sure why people rave about the margaritas, I think they either have no tequila, or it's severly watered down. I agree, avoid the queso. Had the happy hour beef burritos - salty and reminded me of Taco Bell, and the nachos - burnt but otherwise not bad, but not my favorite."}
{"text":"I pass by Ketzal's all the time on my way to Home Depot. It looks great from the road.  My hubby had been to the bar but never ate there so one day coming home from Home Depot we stopped for lunch.  We were told they had had a black out for a couple of hours but they were up and running except the computers.  We we served chips in a cone shaped vessel with several dips. That gave me warm and fuzzies for a great meal to come.  My hubby ordered the Burro Ketzal with shrimp and I ordered the Taco de Camerons.  When I looked at my tacos, I was not sure what I was looking at but I could tell by the scent it was shrimp. The grilled shrimp were the 91/110 count and looked like larvae smothered in sauce. There was no cabbage as per the description only a sad ice berg lettuce next to the saturated tortillas. I was hungry, so what the heck, looks could be deceiving. I took a few bites and it was so salty stopped there.  My husband bit into his Burro Ketzal and they same shrimp were in his as well. He said it was salty but the rice neutralized it a bit. He was not able to finish his either.  I don't believe the power outage had anything to do with the quality of the meal so, we won't be going there again."}
{"text":"Came here with my family this past weekend.  We were looking for authentic Mexican food... didn't get it here but the food was really good.  They start you off with 6 different salsas (all were good but not spicy enough).  My fave was the cilantro salsa which I asked for more of and the waitress kinda laughed at me.  I didn't get that.... but anyway the food was really good.  The margaritas were awesome!  You definitely don't get the portions that you would get at an authentic Mexican restaurant but we all left full.    I'll probably go back again and give the service another shot."}
{"text":"Not a bad place for being an americanized mexican food joint.  I must admit... the margaritas are THA BOMB.  Be careful with that tequila tho... it'll getcha.  I had the fish tacos, which I actually enjoyed.  The prices weren't too bad, but you drink a ton of alcohol, you will end up with a huge bill, not unlike any other place."}
{"text":"To start off with you get six different salsas and warm chips.  our server (forgot your name, nice tats by the way!!) was amazing, she was great with my nephews and very patient... i had two margs for $2 bucks each (for their happy hour, which was also very good and apparently everyday)  they had a kids menu (i guess kids eat free on tuesdays with purchase of adult entree... big bonus for people with kids)  in my eyes it was like a high quality mexican street cart vendor or high quailty los betos.  great prices, salads are very good... i got machaca tacos (not on the menu, but they made anyway) with rice and black beans (which were good as well)  i plan on definitely going back more times!! help this place stay open in n phoenix!!"}
{"text":"Visited twice. Not a big fan of Ketzal on either visit. Small portions, mediocre quality. Not impressed with the salsas which are more like salad dressings. They got me into the restaurant for a second visit with a coupon, then refused to honor the coupon. There is much better authentic Mexican in town. I'd prefer a Rubio's before Ketzal."}
{"text":"Ketzal is a great new Mexican restaurant across from Desert Ridge Marketplace. Barely open a month they already have their act together  The decor, some of it leftover from the Asian restaurant that previously occupied the space, is great. Modern, clean and colorful. Cool bar area and a great dining room.  The service was friendly and prompt, the food was good and the prices were very reasonable on their lunch menu. I had a Chicken Quesadilla and my partner had a Burrito. Both were the lunch portions which came with rice and beans. The meals were tasty and just the right size.   We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place just sucks.  We've given them three opportunities and something has gone wrong every single time.  I appreciate the salsas and the interesting drink selection, but it doesn't make up for bland food and weird service.  The last server we had was so rude and off-putting that we got up and left.  I've NEVER done that before.  Oh well - at least El Encanto Dos is close by."}
{"text":"Very good and fresh burrito. My girlfriend had light tacos with lettuce for taco shells. She enjoyed them as well. Interesting salsa selection that was tasty as well. Good service."}
{"text":"Do not go here!!! Ever!  Ever!  Really bad staff, service, and vibe!!!! Trust me. Do not go here!!!  I took a group of 6 there for Cinco de Mayo and the even messed that up.  Late/poor/bad service and food.  You will have to beg for a water here."}
{"text":"We live across the street from this location. If I was scoring their \"food\" only- they would get a 4-5 star. However.... Let me start by saying the only reason we are NOT weekly regulars is the fact that they have HORRIBLE service. We know that a dinner at Ketzal is gonna be a long drawn out process- filled with \"can we get the \"..?.\" that we have asked 3x's for?  But really. tonight took the cake!  Setting the scene. There were 2 people at the bar.. 1 bar tender. (only 2- one of which I would have cut off long before he got up to stuble out to his car) 6 seated tables.. 1 waitress.  The \"1\" waitress in the joint had to jump behind the bar to make margaritas! Really?! I know the bartender had her hands full with her 2 guests, oh and her CELLPHONE! No joke- bartender girl was on her cellphone serving drinks, processing tabs, and telling people all about the friend she is trying to track down at tent city!!   I wanted to grab her phone and throw it in the margarita machine. Our waitress was SO frazzled trying to keep up with in coming traffic, and bartender was of NO help. No team work at all. A resturant can not function on the back of one employee.   Tuesdays are great with their kids eat free deal. (dine-in only) Which is the ONLY reason why we bother. (ok you got me.. their burgers and fries are the BOMB!) We decided tonight no more!! Our time, and sanity is worth more than $5. If we really have a craving for Ketzals we are ordering TO-GO!   We have been going here for over a year and a half and the service always stinks. GUARANTEED!!  Time to clean up, and set some higher standards of service."}
{"text":"Taco Bell is more authentic then this place!  The chips and salsa are alright however the food was not edible, seriously!   I was the only person in the place and it took 20 minutes to get 2 carne asada tacos!"}
{"text":"This has become my standby for Mexican food in Phoenix. It's not authentic, but it is delicious.  First, they start with fresh (still hot!) tortilla chips and six fresh-made salsas. They keep them all filled for you. Even if you're just getting drinks, you get the best chips and some of the best salsas ever.  The servers are unfailingly excellent. They're efficient, friendly, and sincerely interested in making sure you enjoy your meal. Head and shoulders above most service in the Valley. Also: They're ridiculously hot. It's the little details :-)  The food is standard American-style Mexican fare. Not a lot of options, but they do it well. All the meat is grilled. Just grilled. Not smothered in salt and seasonings. It's just delicious. The idea (I think) is that you can build your own flavor with the salsas they give you.   All the veggies are fresh. The cheese is real. Most everything seems to be assembled right before serving, so there's none of that mushy textureless stuff you get at most Mexican places.   The restaurant is immaculate every time I go in. No sticky tables, no crumbs in the seats.   This isn't white tablecloth dining, but for what it is, it's the best."}
{"text":"I seriously don't understand the low reviews for this restaurant.  My wife and I had them cater our pre-wedding dinner and the whole group (30 people) loved every bite.  We went back again recently and ate until our stomachs hurt.  As for the prices, that gut filling experience cost us about $25 which included a huge portion of guacamole and two sodas.  My wife got the beef tacos, I got the machaca burrito.  Yeah, it costs more than Chipotle, but it's also a different experience.  As for the comment about the place going out of business...not a chance.  We were lucky to be a party of two because we got the last open table.  I looked around again before we left and there were still no open tables and probably 2-3 parties waiting at the door.  Oh, and a sign in the window said they're opening another location in Desert Ridge in January.  That one will be closer for us, so I'm sure we'll go more often in 2010.  The food is going to be slightly different from that which you'd expect to find at Macayos or Garcias or something like that.  The owners are from Mexico, first generation business owners in the US.  They brought the recipes (and according to their menu, even the flour) straight from central Mexico.  That other stuff we eat at chain Mexican food restaurants is what we've been TOLD is authentic.  So, yeah, you're going to get a different flavor and presentation at Ketzal.  No, I do not work for Ketzal or have any special incentive for writing this review.  I just genuinely like the place and wanted to stand up for it."}
{"text":"I dont understand how a second restaurant was opened on Tatum . My husband and gave these place too many chances and wach time the food was not impressive. The margaritas come from a stolen recipe from La Pinata Nueva , but too bad they didnt bring the recipes with them. I hope they get it \" that maybe if you put alittle quality in the food people will come back\"."}
{"text":"Food - 1 star - Are you kidding me? How does a place like this stay in business? Maybe everyone goes there once, as we did, but never returns. We ordered carne asada, quesadilla, tacos, and margaritas. The drinks were actually really good. The food was significantly better at Taco Bell across the street and our bill was 10 times the price.  I guarantee Ketzal will be OUT OF BUSINESS in 1-2 years.   2011 Update: Yup, I was correct. It took 1.5 years."}
