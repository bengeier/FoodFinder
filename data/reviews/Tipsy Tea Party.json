{"text":"Super cool find at The Camby Hotel in the heart of the Biltmore District. They offer a modern and fun boozy twist on traditional high tea service with inventive eats in the Bees Knees Lounge. The menu includes a large selection of cocktails served in a tea pot or champagne glass. The \"Verbena Dream\" tea pot is a must try!! Make sure you come hungry so you can try the food which isn't your traditional tea sandwich. The avocado, crab and mango slider is out of this world! The petite sweets are also hard to pass up."}
{"text":"Wow we saw this Tipsy Tea on the news and so happy we stopped in!  What a cool twist on afternoon tea and definitely nothing like what you see at the other spots in the valley.  Cocktails served in a tea pot is way cool!  The food was super unique too and honestly delicious. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"The tea and the food were great, but be weary about ordering anything not included. We ordered a bottle of champagne thinking it was $25 and they gave us the $150 bottle without asking. When we questioned them about it they said they would remove it, then added it back when the checks were split out. We would have asked for a manager, but we did that the first time and he was our server."}
{"text":"Wow!! Tipsy Tea did not disappoint! We went after seeing the news segment on Good Morning Arizona (Kylie Cruz!) and it was amazing! The bartender, Brian, made incredible twisted tea cocktails, including my favorite, The Eastern Orchestra, a yummy tea infused champagne cocktail.  The tea bites were so delicious and included tea sandwiches with herb ricotta & prosciutto, fried green tomatoes, but the deviled eggs were my favorite!! A must check-out Friday & Saturdays 2-5pm, it won't be long and it will be all the buzz (I know lame...since it is held at the Bees Knees at The Camby )."}
{"text":"We did this for a friends birthday and it was really nice. Kyle was our server and he was fantastic. The only thing I really didn't like was I thought the amount of tea was chincy. He said each pot gave you 2 and a half cups of tea and we each got about a cup and a half from our pots. Maybe 2 but these are tea cups. We tried everything they offered as far as tea pots. They were all very good. The finger foods were ok...the desserts were delicious. They add the gratuity so watch for that. Overall, the experience was worth the $50."}
