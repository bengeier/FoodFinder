{"text":"Ordered the pick up special.. 1 large with 2 toppings + free dipping sauce for around $10. The deal was pretty good so I figured I would order considering how quick they usually are... ordered half cheese and half pepperoni and this is what I got.... going elsewhere for proper toppings."}
{"text":"It was my first time ordering pizza here. I ordered pizza, wings and garlic bread . It was all great. The pizza taste great with lots of toppings on it. The wings taste so good. The garlic bread had so much cheese on it. I will be going back ."}
{"text":"Love their thin crust pizza.  Been a customer of theirs for many years.  Their new location (south of Walmart) is ideal."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time at this location (Torbram/Queen.) Customer service stinks!  If they mess up your order, they will blame you and not correct it.  There used to be a very kind and sincere gentleman running this business. Nowadays, you get a rude woman with poor English who has zero business sense.  It's unfortunate for this Moga's Pizza location.  It used to be well run.  They need to take a close look at those who are managing their business and make some changes before they lose even more customers."}
{"text":"Accidentally went to this place! Said that we would get a big discount for the pizza slices if we order pre-made slices! And we got a DISCOUNT of $1!! .  I would have gone with that, but it's the attitude of the  cashier/server that threw me off!. He dealt with us as if he was paying us to eat his burnt/dry pizza!!! Never going back to this place and dear friends please stay away!!"}
{"text":"First and last time coming here. I came in on December 22, ordering the \"Holiday Special\", which was advertised on a giant billboard outside the plaza entrance. The deal was for a 1 topping party square pizza with a dipping sauce for $11.49. After we ordered they rang up the bill and we were charged full price for the pizza. We told the guy at the front that the price outside says $11.49. He insisted that there was no special and that he can only give it to us for $12.49. We showed him a photo on our phone of the sign that we took on the way in and he called us liars and said that photo was from the summer! We ended up leaving, very angry and disappointed. The situation was very unprofessionally handled and the way he spoke to us was completely rude. Overall horrible customer service and false advertising! For those reasons I will never come back here again."}
{"text":"this place is walking distance from my house -the service is good and the pizza is always fresh. even their orders are ready and fresh. i enjoy good customer service, the people are the front are always so friendly and happy to help you"}
{"text":"Worst place ever  Worst experience  Being their regular customer, got very disappointed tdy with their service  The person who took my order sounds really rude on the phn and when u called back after 45 minutes they said we have no order under your name and number.

U guys don't even deserve one star"}
{"text":"I ordered x large deluxe pizza with EXTRA GARLIC, EXTRA GINGER, EXTRA HOT CHILLIES AND EXTRA SAUCE.  I received pepperoni pizza with NO EXTRAS AT ALL !!!!!!!!! I called the place and the man had audacity to tell me that he did put those extras in my pizza and I could drive back with what I received to show it to him !!! Outrageous !!!"}
{"text":"I've only recently heard about Mog as and decided to give it a try. I placed an order for the large 3 topping with free dipping sauce and asked for pepperoni, mushrooms and bacon. When it arrived I paid the guy and then checked and they had given me the wrong pizza. It only had onions and bacon. I let it go and didn't bother complaining because I felt it was a minor mistake and probably wouldn't happen all the time. The second time I order from them I tell them as usually my toppings etc and that im paying by debit. The guy comes and I hand him my card and he's like \"oh it doesn't say, maybe you didn't tell them\" um no. More like whoever is handling the orders isn't listening. I don't have cash and usually pay by debit. I found it annoying. I don't know if ill order from here again because little problems add up and its a simple communication error that they need to work on"}
