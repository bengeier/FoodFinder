{"text":"Tried the eclairs and creme brûlée once. Not my favourite. The cream in eclairs tasted stale i cant really eat it and nothing is spectacular from the creme brûlée. Give them another chance and get another eclairs and mille feuille but same problem, stale cream. I wonder if this is the style or maybe its day old? Anyway, i dont think i will be returning for this. Maybe for something else what other yelpers are saying."}
{"text":"I was welcomed by the manager herself, a very nice and knowledgeable person. They claim it's French inspired specialties but it's clearly North American interpretation of what European eat in movies. Pizza was ok, nothing mind blowing considering the price. Too bad they're so close to the Atwater market, where you can eat the same stuff and enjoy much greater value. It's only their first week, so they have room to improve"}
{"text":"Cute little cafe in St Henri. They have both pastries and meal time food options. They have a good deal going on with the purchase of a coffee you get a croissant for free.  They had actually run out of croissants so we got upgraded to a Danish type pastry. Not really the place to go sit for hours and do work, but more like a nice stop during a Sunday walk."}
{"text":"Une bonne boulangerie/épicerie du quartier. Ma cousine et moi avons partager une pizza zucchini, poivrons et fromage fêta et la salade de kale. C'était bon, mais je conseillerais une autre pizza, puisque le goût n'était pas assez prononcé."}
{"text":"Rosetta is a great new addition to Notre Dame and now that the construction is finished on the street it is a terrific place to stop in while you're strolling around the neighbourhood. 

That's how we found it. 

They offer a great selection of salads, sandwiches, pizzas a and treat to either take out or eat in.  We tried a few pizzas and salads and everything has been very good.  The portions are generous and when eating in the presentation it very nice. 

Rosetta even has flat and sparkling water on tap."}
{"text":"Hands down! My favorite bakery so far! Since my first visit, I believe I returned at Rosetta countless times.

I went back with my little sister to pick a small cake for my sister's birthday. I picked strawberry chocolate shortcake. Fantastic/ beautiful and delicious! 

At my workplace, the rule is when it's your birthday, you bring your own cake. Everything looked so good; I didn't know what to choose. Maria, the owner, helped to choose an exquisite cake. White Chocolate and dark chocolate mousse cake with Peach ganache! Omg... I want to die; it was extremely succulent.

Through email, I contacted Rocco, owner (Maria's son), to order a customized cake. It was a red velvet cake with gold icing, two gold macaroons on top with a two black roses. I went to the bakery, to pay a deposit. I bought their artisanal pizza called piquant. That was amazing, every flavor of the pizza was bursting deliciously in my mouth. I also picked up a dozen mixed macaroons. My family and I devoured them. A week later, I picked up the cake for my friend's 30th birthday. What a beautiful cake! The cake was made with perfection. The Birthday girl and the guests enjoyed it very much.

Today, last minute, we needed a gluten free cake for a co worker leaving us. So I called at Rosetta; I talked to the amazing Maria. She put aside a Framboisie and 10 times three layered (white, milk and dark) of chocolate pastries gluten free. My friend Fotini picked up the pastries from Pedro and Rocco. Lunchtime, we surprised our co coworker with it. She was surprised and enjoyed the treats big time.

Food is absolutely delicious and service is beyond perfect."}
{"text":"My friend had nothing but amazing things to say about this bakery so I decided to give it a try. I was overwhelmed by all the delicious options. There were tons of macarons, cakes, cookies, bread, pastries and even pizza to choose from. I decided to go for the cherry, strawberry and chocolate macarons and a chai latte. I was very satisfied with my choice. My friend really enjoyed her pizza as well. The cake display was very creative and they look perfect for events. The service was great as we were warmly greeted. The owner is very friendly and helpful. I will definitely be returning to try more of their yummy treats."}
{"text":"Good pizza. I like. Refreshing in a neighborhood  that needs good Italian style pizza"}
{"text":"Nous sommes retournés à Rosetta afin de commander un gâteau d'anniversaire pour environs 25 personnes, connaissant les goûts de la fêtée, avec l'aide de la serveuse j'ai opté pour un shortcake aux fruits. La décoration était magnifique mais je dois dire que j'ai été très déçue de la qualité du gâteau, il y avait beaucoup trop des fruits sur le dessus et vraiment pas assez à l'intérieur, en fait l'intérieur était principalement de la crème fouetté, ce qui faisait que le gâteau avait aucune structure et s'écroulait au moment de le couper, par conséquence les parts n'étaient pas très égales et jolies. Ensuite c'était beaucoup de fruits aux sirop !!! Peut être c'est juste moi, mais quand on me dit au shortcake aux fruits, je m'attend à des fruits frais, mais la il y avait quelques fraises et mures mais sinon pas mal juste des poires et pêches au sirop. Donc tout le gâteau était pas mal et avait pas une texture agréable en bouche. 

Pour terminer, au moment où j'ai voulu reprendre de leur pâte à pizza, j'ai remarqué qu'ils ont ajouté la liste des ingrédients sur les sacs, et ils ajoutent du sucre dans leur pâte. Personnellement pour moi c'est un tue l'amour."}
{"text":"It's very difficult to find a true Italian bakery outside of the traditional Italian neighborhoods yet Rosetta easily makes the cut.  From their tomato pizza (it must be eaten cold!!!) to their focaccia sandwiches and their espresso, they definitely hit the mark. Their stuff is awesome. It brings me back to the old childhood neighborhood. Staff is also very friendly and courteous. From someone who grew up and is  still is spoiled by great Italian culinary delights,  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Professional and exceptional service! I made an order over the phone to have birthday cake delivered to my boyfriends workplace. I was pretty worried as I did not order in advance, and that it was such a last minute, i didn't have much expectation. But the lady (i think the owner) over the phone was so helpful as to picking the right size  of the cake, right kind of cake based on what my boyfriend liked! And it was perfectly delivered to his workplace at the promised time (she also sent copy of a receipt right after charging my credit card, i find this very professional!) 
Although I personally have not tasted the cake, my boyfriend and his colleagues said it tasted absolutely amazing, and said they plan to go try other cake/desserts as well :D Now i must try Rosetta's cake when I visit Montreal!!"}
{"text":"Simply based on its appearance, I was a little skeptical of Rosetta. Seemed a little too rich for my blood. Naturally, one has to remember not to judge a book by its cover.

The establishment won me over yesterday when I came in to pick up some bread (all other practical options were out) and found the place occupied by elderly Italian folks. For a neighbourhood that's getting a bad rep for being over-run with millennials, that's quite nice. Additionally I learnt that their plain slab pizza is in fact vegan- previously a misguided employee had told me \"there's cheese in everything\". The fella who served me yesterday was very friendly and seemed to know what he was talking about.

What also pleased me was they were selling big and beautiful day-old country loaves for $2.50. An excellent price indeed. The bread ended up being a little dense with OK flavour but it makes a half-decent toast, I'd say."}
