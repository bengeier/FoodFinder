{"text":"Food is cheap and decent. Very fried, very oily, characteristic of south Asian fast food. They serve burgers and such, but I personally wouldn't go for that. Pricing is very low too. 

I would normally rate this higher, because like many other shops of this kind they know who they're serving and are good for what they are. They're intentionally a low-end hub for the high school kids nearby as well as the massive south Asian community clustered in this area. 

However, one peek into their kitchen was very concerning. They need to definately work on their health and safety before someone gets sick."}
{"text":"I tried the large chicken biryani and found it very spicy. It was too spicy to eat. The flavour of the rice and chicken drumsticks were good but just way too spicy! I like spicy but not to that extreme. I wish I was told about the heat or given an option to choose mild, but my guess is that it was already pre-made that way. I wish I got the burger and fries instead for the same price. Oh well."}
{"text":"I'm basing my 4 stars on the chicken biryani and kebabs only. They are at par, if not better than the self-proclaimed \"king\" of biryani guys. 

Have had both the chicken and beef kebabs as a sandwich roll (think pita pit but wrapped in warm naan) and also separately as meat only. Both are enjoyably spicy even when requesting in mild.  When requesting in spicy, also enjoyable, but your tummy might be sad a couple hours later. =)

Whatever you do, don't get the butter chicken. I gave it a second chance and haven't forgiven myself since.

Also, if you are in a rush, call in with your order 15 mins ahead of time as they grill the kebabs to order (which is a plus in my books).

My 4 stars is not based on venue as located in a plaza that has seen better times before the turn of the century, if at all.  Most order takeout, not much room to sit."}
{"text":"Incredible Biryani and chicken. Some of the best I've had in the city. 
Highly recommended. 
Very friendly owner too. Excellent overall!"}
{"text":"The food was ok. But the service seems a bit off. It was my first time there so i was looking at the menu and the lady was rushing me to pick. So i asked for chicken biryani and she said they were out, so i asked for chicken karahi with rice and she said they were out of rice so the meal didn't come with rice. What a joke."}
{"text":"This is close to where we lived so I decided to try them out for the first time. Although everything here is decent, it isn't something exceptional that I would go back for. The biryani rice was okay but I find the rice a little too overcooked in my opinion yet I do like the hint of spice in it. Unfortunately, the butter chicken I had was disappointing, it had like 4 small pieces of chicken and the sauce was too oily and soupy to a point I was questioning if its even butter chicken. (BTW: to the guy who said he found it hilarious that I said butter chicken is supposed to be oily, I KNOW how to make it and I know what the consistency is like since I ate a lot of it at different places.)

Overall, its okay considering they have other things in the menu but I dont think I would go back here again. Maybe one day if am desperate but I'll make the extra trip somewhere else if am up for it."}
{"text":"The first thing I went for was the burgers & fries combo for $4.49. You might think that's the last thing you'll go for at a Pakistani restaurant, but it's definitely worth it. Fries are made with spices, and the burger meat is infused with spices as well, topped with mayonnaise and lettuce, with a soft bun. Excellent choice!

It's definitely a take-out style place; there's only a few chairs and tables, and the space itself is rather crammed. Service is also a little slow (10-15 minutes), but that's understandable given the quality. Check it out!"}
{"text":"3.5*

For what it is, re:  a small, Indian, takeout counter in a somewhat shady strip mall, I thought this place was pretty good!

Since I *love* Chicken Biryani, that's what I ordered here...to-go!  Good/standard pricing as expected based on the type of set-up, $4.99 for a \"medium\" sized styro container.

Note:  It did take some time in-between ordering and when food was actually ready.  I'd say at least 15mins as I had a detailed conversation with another customer there.

Chicken Biryani was one of the better ones that I've had as of lately!  And it was actually spicy?  That was definitely a FIRST!  Piece of chicken that I did have was quite tender and juicy, not dry at all.  Good flavours going on here!"}
{"text":"We went to Karachi Grill to get our take-out dinner, butter chicken and tandoori chicken. The waiting time is not that long. 
We are open our take-out dinner, first, our butter chicken look so oily and very liquited so bad. But we had good faith for it, maybe the taste not bad. So we tried, well if you see first look if you think is not good, just trust your feeling. 
Very oily, very thin, no creamy taste and maybe you called soup butter chicken.
If you want butter chicken, don't go there."}
{"text":"A quaint little South Asian restaurant in a small plaza. There's nothing too fancy about the ambience and Decor, a very simple and small location. I had the naan and chana masala with saag paneer. The naan was a bit disappointing, seemed and tasted more like a generic pita (which I guess it was). The chana masala was too oily but decent enough. The saag paneer was fine but perhaps missing a few important spices. Overall, fine, nothing to go out of your way for."}
