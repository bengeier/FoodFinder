{"text":"This place has such a nice, chill patio, absolutely perfect for a tangy, creamy, mango lassi on a lazy summer afternoon. We also got an order of beef momo dumplings which were really great, not so sure about the dipping sauce that comes with them though. Good food,  great patio, 5 stars."}
{"text":"First time trying Tibetan food. Had the beef alu pingshu with fried bread. Beef curry stew, with glass noodles, potatoes, and sliced black mushrooms. Awesome! You get a choice of bread or rice - get the bread!  You'll get two large frisbee sized ovals of fried bread to dip in to the curry. It's a big serving; eat half in, and buy extra bread and take home for a second meal. A great meal for under $10"}
{"text":"I consider myself a bit of an expert on Tibetan food, having grown up on it, and in my expert (humble) opinion Tsampa is THE place for Tibetan food in Toronto. Set up more like a fast food joint- no printed menu's (just a white board), you seat yourself, lots of patrons take it to go & cheap prices - the decor is minimal and functional, but once you're eating, it's hard to care.  Their menu is not extensive, but genearlly Tibetan food is limited in choices. What they do have though, is a good selection of well prepared Tibetan food. My favorite dishes here have to be their pork chowmein, shabhaley (beef patty), aloo dum (spicy potatoes served with puri), and their momos (dumplings).  If I had to mention a con - they have ceiling to floor windows on two sides, and while it's great for people watching, it's not so great for people watching you as they walk by when you're stuffing your face :) so maybe they could put up some sheer curtains??"}
{"text":"Been here quite a nunber of times. One of my favorite joint in the area when I am up for some Tibetan food Mainly MoMos."}
{"text":"Walked past this place on Tuesday evening and saw that the place was quite full, so decided to have my dinner there. Was a big mistake! I ordered chicken soup. They brought me a huge bowl of spicy water with a few pieces of chicken and lots of tofu to make it look like there was more chicken. For my second meal I ordered beef with rice. They brought huge pieces of beef, but didn't offer a knife! They also forgot to bring me any napkins. Avoid this place!"}
{"text":"Fried beef momos are delicious.  Had their T1 noodle soup and quite standard fare. Tastes quite pure but is on the saltier side.   About 8-10 momos per order and comes with the same beef soup"}
{"text":"Randomly decided to pick up some take-out from Tsampa. I pass it almost every day and have never tried it. This day I chose, was THE day.  Tsampa is a small resto, mostly for take out. They have a few tables.. but it's nothing fancy. I could tell the food was going to be good.  There are no menus, just the chalkboard on the wall.  They have food cooked and ready for take out - like chicken, potatoes and rice.  I didn't know what I really felt like, so I ordered the ready curry chicken, spicy potatoes and rice.  OMG delicious. When I say, 'spicy' potatoes, I am not joking. I actually couldn't eat them.. and I adore spicy. I usually get the hiccups when I eat something that's too hot.. and the taters were it. They were so tasty though, I had a hard time NOT eating them.   I also ordered the fresh fried bread, and ate the chicken with the bread, sopping up the curry sauce. It was lovely, flavorful and everything I had expected. I will absolutely order take out again - order something different. It's absolutely worth a try. I think my whole meal was $7."}
{"text":"About 2wks ago, I finally went for dinner at Tsampa Café. When I first starting going to Parkdale for Tibetan food, it never appealed to me, looking more like a hang-out than a nice restaurant. More recently though, I noticed that the place looked nice and new, so in I went, and then I returned this past Sunday again. The inside does look newly painted in blue and orange, with wood décor and nice furniture. While the service was a bit slow on my first visit, it was quite fast this second time. When I first sat down both times, I was given a menu and a small pad to write down my order.  The menu has the usual Himalayan items: momos (dumplings), thukpa (noodle soup) and chili fries. On my first trip, I had Chana Sandeko (a black chick pea mixture), steamed beef momos and a mango lassi. Everything was very good; the chana was spicy but not too much so, and the momos were soft but still firm enough to eat. This past Sunday, I had the Nepali vegetarian thali, which included dal and spicy potatoes and vegetables along with rice, and a puri that I ordered separately. The puri was more doughy than I expected, but was still good, and the spicy potatoes was the best item on the thali. I don't really care for eggplant, but it was not bad although served cold.  Overall, this adds another pretty good choice to my list of Himalayan restaurants, and I expect that I will return. My bills were $19 for the first meal, and $14 for the second including a cup of butter tea to go."}
{"text":"One of my best tibetan restaurant from every aspect.. highly recommended.. awesome service.. awesome food for very reasonable price. ."}
{"text":"O.M.G!!! We came across this place by chance, we actually went for an apartment viewing in the area and were super hungry. The place is small it has a home feel to it, staff is nice but they don't talk a much. Make sure when you go there you are not in a hurry, the wait time for the food is a bit long but it's worth the wait. We had a platter which came with rice,stew beef and veggies, it was amazing loved it a lot. If you don't like spicy food this place is not for you , as most of their best dishes have a hint of spicy flavour to it. I'm definitely going back and recommending to to friends and family"}
{"text":"Best Tibetan in Toronto and best sha-balay this old mouth head has ever munched!"}
{"text":"It was my first time trying out Tibetan food and I definitely was not disappointed. It was a small   family run restaurant so staff was a tad short (two servers) We waited around 30 minutes after for our food to arrive but it worth the wait. The food was filled with flavour and super tasty. I'd definitely would come here again !"}
{"text":"My Nepali friend was craving for momo's so we came down the west end to hunt for Nepali food. Himalayan Kitchen was closed so we decided to give this place a try.   I wanted something warm/soupy so my Nepali friend recommended I get the Jhol momo. It turned out not to be the traditional jhol momo (dumplings in soup), but just some momo's with this thick curry sauce on top. It was very disappointing since the sauce was cold on some parts and even the momo inside looked like it was not fully cooked. I couldn't finish it. On top, nowhere on the menu did it indicate that this dish was spicy. Although I like spicy food, it was just a tad too much. I can only imagine how this could catch someone else who doesn't eat spicy at all off guard.  We had some chilli fries and the pork choyla, which is okay but everything just tasted like plain spicy food and kind of ruined my palette. When my friend spoke to the waitress/owner at the front cash that it was spicy at the end of meal, she was defensive saying that we're the first that has mentioned it. Perhaps it's just me but my Nepali friend ordered the thali and said it was okay but overall didn't like the food that much either.   Anyways I would not return. I've been to a few Nepali places and they were always so warm and friendly and this place didn't give that vibe. The dishes we've ordered seem not fresh but frozen and reheated. I've had better, skip this and try something else."}
