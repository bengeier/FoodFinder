{"text":"The food was terrible and overpriced.  Salad limp, brown, and warm. 10.99 burgers for kids and 2.50 soda.  24.99 for ribs and few fries. No extras, maybe some bread and slaw would of been nice.Had to wait for forks to eat the lousy food.  Place felt dirty and restroom disgusting. Because of large party added a $30 tip for poor service.   Check credit card a few days later and they doubled the tip, making it $60.  Of course when I call, the manager is always busy but will return my call promptly. Still no call back.  Will not answer e mails either.  This is truly a shady place."}
{"text":"The salmon was the fishyest thing ever and the service was lacking.   In my party of around 13 people, at least 7 of the dishes were sent back for various reasons, usually the unpleasant smell from the salmon, but also things like rock hard burger buns.  If you come here, expect a bar-food experience, not sit down dining restaurant experience."}
{"text":"For me and my posse, this place is a one star. For hooknasties and hambones, it is a 5 star. So, use your judgment."}
{"text":"So we only went here because my fiance picked it out.  We ordered nachos with chicken, and decided lets see how that taste and maybe we'll order more, NOPE!  How can you mess up on nachos?  First the chips were stale.  The two types of cheese \"melted\" on there was cold. EEW!  The chicken on there was also cold.  The salsa on there was basically diced tomatoes and not salsa.  You know its bad when you mess up on nachos.  The only reason I kept eating was because I was starving.  I will never come back and recommend no one to eat here.  Only thing cool about this place is the outdoor seating."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of trailer trash trying to be country.  It offers the bull riding and rustic decorations with all the signs of STDs during the weekend (first visit).  I would love to try and ride the bull someday, though, maybe after a little disinfectant.    I came here with some coworkers for a quick drink.  The service was somewhat slow for a slightly packed bar (after my second visit since you can't really judge how slow the service really is when the bar is packed on the weekends).  They had minimal beer selections and the best they could offer was a Budweiser (not that I dislike Budweiser, but I was something darker and hoppy).  Were they out of other beers?  During my first visit, they ran out of Jack and pretty much all the other liquors before 1:30?!.. Isn't the point of a bar to have liquor on hand?  Oddly, I felt comfortable sitting there during happy hour on my second visit, watching tv and throwing back a few bad beers.    Also, I like their patio with the gas fireplace; it's really nice on a chilly night."}
{"text":"The Cadillac Ranch is not safe.  A major purse theft ring operates at this location.  I know - I was a recent victim. I was surrounded on the dance floor by a band of thieves. My purse was gone in seconds. I would describe the CR as \"seedy\".  If you are a young professional - male or female - your coat or purse could be targeted by these criminals. You will not be able to count on the CR staff or the Cleveland Police to help you.  Do yourself a favor and choose another place to go."}
{"text":"I came for the reception prior to the opening of the 2009 Cleveland International Film Festival.  I didn't get a good gander at the rooms at the entrance, but the lounge and probably dance floor is spacious.  The drink selection was quite poor, having no single malts -- I get the feeling the place is balanced towards easy-on-the-palate cocktails.  Service was fair, but it wasn't a dance-club night.  Had a reasonably good time, but I'd chalk that up to the company."}
{"text":"Eh, well.... I was forced to go here last Saturday evening with a group of girls for a bachelorette party. Thank Alcohol that I don't remember much about this place besides: that really creepy looking mechanical bull that everyone talks about, the horribly slow service, the very overpriced crappy drinks, the awful music. I don't want to be TOO scathing so I'll stop now."}
{"text":"I'm glad this place exists, because we need to fill as many downtown storefronts as we can in Cleveland. For that, an extra star. Outside of that, I can't come up with very many positive things to say. Cadillac Ranch is beyond clich√©, and the food is the same stuff you'd get at any Tchotchke's across the U.S.A. It has a mechanical bull...? I guess it's a club-restaurant? And the bull and the exterior fire pits surrounded by couches with soiled white cushions are part of the schtick? Here's a tip: If you're going to provide exterior seating, don't use *white* cushions. Go with an earth-tone, something that hides dirt. Something that doesn't make one feel the need to sanitize before, during and after sitting on it.   Also, the service is bad. Also, everything costs too much for what you get.  When I pull money out of my wallet to eat, I want to be left with an experience that I at least mildly enjoy remembering. But maybe that's not the point of this place?"}
{"text":"Bonus stars for the bull.... oh yea, and for letting us run around the bull after it was turned off, manually spinning it and jumping over the top of it without getting scolded or thrown out.   With that said, what kind of bar/restaurant doesn't have orange slices on hand?!  And runs out of booze before midnight?! WTH....."}
{"text":"I've gone to Cadillac Ranch several times, almost always for after-work drinks.  After each time I go I tell myself that I won't go again, but as time passes, I tend to forgive and forget with the hope that things have improved.  Things, however, don't improve.  My main problem is with their service, which is incredibly slow.  It takes way to long to get the bartender's attention just to order a drink, even when it's not crowded.  On top of that, mixed drinks are served in a plastic cup.  If you do happen to snag one of the tables outside (possibly the only thing Cadillac Ranch has going for it), the service gets even worse:  No one comes by to check on the table, see if you want to order anything, or get back to you about the check.  Why they can't even reach this bare minimum level of service is beyond me.  If you're looking for after-work drinks, you would be far better off going down East 4th to Flannery's.  The big downside with Flannery's, in my opinion, is that it's a little cramped.  On the other hand, it is plainly no coincidence that Cadillac Ranch has so many empty seats inside."}
{"text":"I'm not exactly too sure on the Cadillac Ranch side of the place to be honest, but i'm a very big fan of Bar Room that is connected to Cadillac Ranch.  When I moved to Cleveland I was hoping to find my place, and Bar Room is just that. Nice large Dance Floor, Attractive Crowd, VIP for those special nights.   Friday's are a bit slower than Saturday and a good break from the HUGE crowd.  Saturday's are a busy night with tons of fun!  The music is sterotypical dance music, top40, but mixed well."}
{"text":"I don't know about the food here, as I visited it later into the evening.  The restaurant/bar consists of three separate areas.  The front room is the main restaurant.  It is a country-themed steak-house saloon with two bars and a mechanical bull.  As you make your way back toward the bathrooms, you notice that beyond this huge room there is more.  The next room you come to is a swank, low-key lounge.  I wasn't looking for swank or low-key, so I completely bypassed this section.  The next room is the dance club.  Again this is a very large room with two bars - one of which is located on the second-floor loft overlooking the dance floor.  The DJ played a good mix that kept the diverse crowd happy and dancing well into the night."}
{"text":"I've read all the reviews and the the bar still sounded fun. I intended to go in with an open mind and an understanding that the service may not be good.  I'm pretty laid back and wasn't in a hurry so I had nothing but time. True to the reviews, I waitress was horrible.  So we just tipped accordingly.  I bartended for years and am usually a heavy tipper.  This girl got a flat 15%.  We proceeded to the Martini bar and it was dead. But we still sat down and ordered Martinis.  The bartender, Tom turned out to be a lot of fun,  Much to our delight, he gave us quite a few FREE shots. 4 through out the night.  He was so much fun, he did them with us!!  He had to be drinking all along because he STAGGERED out of the bar.      A new bartender replaced him and we were ready to leave. For some reason, Tom took my debit card with  him when he counted out his till as opposed to cashing me out immediately. We waited for him to come back with our card for quite some time until I called the manager.     It took the manager a good 15 minutes to even show up. While I waited for him I had time to call the police, call my bank and have another cocktail!!       When he finally did appear, I explained that Tom had taken my debit card and never returned with it.  I also explained to the manager, that I was in from out of town and now have no way to pay for my hotel or meals while on our trip.  He initially was being helpful, asked how much my hotel was, as if he was going to help me out. When I explained that we were there for TWO nights, his whole attitude changed.      He said that if I continued swearing at him, he was not going to help me in any way.  Keep in mind, I'm a grown woman.  I've worked with the public all of my adult life. I am also a very SMART woman and I know that if I want someone to do something for me, being rude is not the way to get results.  I will also admit that I might have said \"where the hell could he have gone with my debit card\" or something to that effect but was, by no means, even MAD at the manager.  There would be no reason to cuss at him.     Funny, after I called the cops, the manager then called Tom and Tom RETURNED with my debit card.  How interesting is that?    Now, it is VERY possible that Tom meant no harm. He really MAY have taken my debit card on accident.  He was hammered when he attempted to cash us out.  I'm, by no means calling him a thief.  And to be honest, I'm WAY more appalled by the actions of that manager than I am with Toms \"absent mindedness\".      There are so many other great bars in Cleveland.  I suggest you steer clear of this place.  Its WAY more of an annoyance than it could possibly be worth."}
{"text":"I have gone here a few times for happy hour and twice to eat.  The food is over priced, for what it is and there isn't much of a variety.  There are some nice drink specials during happy hour which makes it a nice place to meet friends.  Another bonus is some great outdoor seating.    Also for what it is worth they have a mechanical bull...I am sure many a bachelorette party enjoys this."}
{"text":"Stopped in here after a day of sight seeing (Cleveland Museum of Art) and before attending that night's Yankees v Indians game. Arrived just after they opened at 4:00 pm.  Went to wash up in the Men's room. It smelled profusely of day's old urine.   It's the Hard Rock Cafe by another name. Not a good thing in my book.  The burger and pulled pork sandwich is what you would expect from a bland, corporate chain. At least the beer was cold."}
{"text":"The Cadillac Ranch is basically a parody of itself. No one comes here for a classy evening. You come here for humor and low rent silliness. Even before entering the doors, I had a vague idea of what to expect....  There's a bloated Shaun Rogers look-a-like bouncer checking ID's at the entrance. Like most sketchy places, he seemed only interested in the male ID's. The ladies aren't hassled at all. Once past security and into the bar, you quickly realize this is a different type of place. The bar you've previously only seen mocked in movies and TV shows. This is the type of bar a Snooki would feel right at home. The place is crawling with Jersey Shore types. There was one particular gent who looked like Gio, only 15 years older and 50lbs heavier. He purposely left the top 4 buttons unbuttoned on his gaudy orange Tommy Hilfiger shirt to expose his gold necklace and chest hair.   The 'Ranch has a mechanical bull as it's center piece attraction. An air mattress to brace your inevitable fall only masks the danger involved in riding this hydraulic horse from hell. There's a reason you have to sign a waiver before latching your thighs around the bull. One of the girls from our group ended up with a nice shiner from her experience. Besides that, the bull actually provided an evening full of laughs. Watching people try to get on the bull was just as much fun watching them get flung off in an instant. Drunken lookers-on screaming for the riders to \"take off your shirt!!\" and other harassments followed. All in all, a pretty fun time.   While we didn't eat here and I'm not convinced I ever would want to, we did order our fair share of drinks. Drinks which seemed to be fairly expensive for what they were. I was particularly disappointed in the plastic mugs they poured the brews in. But I suppose I could understand. Jersey Shore types like to throw-down after a night of Patr√≥n, so this was a preventative measure to eliminate the chance of a glass bottle to the dome.   In the restrooms, I found more intrigue. The toilets were all black porcelain as if to mask the syphilis and herpes that are probably crawling over the seats. At the sink is an actual real live bathroom attendant who squirts a drop of soap into your palm. Kind of weird for a place like this to have a bathroom attendant. I presume it's to help scare off bathroom sex rather than to provide upper-class amenities.  All in all, this place is pretty much a disaster. But, like other joints, the fun you have is measured with the company you keep. Even if the place is terrible, good company can make a skeevy place a little more bearable."}
{"text":"I've been forced to go here for office happy hours. Consistently the service is lacking, the drinks are overpriced and served in small plastic cups, and the food is nothing worth mentioning. Last time we visited a full on fist fight broke out and the cops were called. It was almost as good entertainment as the mechanical bull. I give this restaurant an extra star bc it has a great location, outdoor space and so much potential. I would honestly like to see it succeed and overcome..."}
{"text":"Connected to the bar Room, Cadillac Ranch is one of two places in the East 4th/Euclid district with dancing.   There's a generic Southern, American theme, with wooden tables and seating and guitars on the walls.  The crowd was college-aged to early 30s, with the typical midwestern going out clothes [that subject is its own post, we'll leave that for yelp talk for now] although on the whole, the crowd is was more subdued [less people falling down drunk, hooking up in plain slight] here than at barroom or on west 6th.  A friend said someone looked exactly like Snooky from the jersey shore.   In my 3 visits, the service has been mixed. Sometimes it was quick, considering the large crowd, other times not.  I received a gift card here and at each purchase over the visits, several minutes passed as the bartender tracked down the manager to complete the gift card transaction, annoying. On the positive side, I went here once on an idle Sunday afternoon to cap a downtown bike ride with a Christmas Ale, a friend and I were the only ones at the bar and received great service.   Drinks are expensive [shots $7.50-9, domestic bottles 3.50, 6.50 for a mixed drink] but unfortunately, those prices are the norm downtown.   That said, the dance floor is very small relative to the amount of people that Cadillac Ranch can hold. The music was current Top40 and the occasional 80s [michael jackson, warrant]. The DJ was good at beat-matching, transition the tracks from one to another but the music selection is the same as other bars, meh.   I noticed as the night progressed, those who wanted to dance moved to the BarRoom which has a much larger dance floor.   If you're on East 4th and want to dance, stop by. It does what it aims to do in a mediocre fashion with a small dance floor and bright lights.  Otherwise, there's little reason to go here."}
{"text":"I've been to Cadillac Ranch three times because it's next door to where I used to work.  The first two visits included ordering lunch and the food was VERY average.  The food really isn't worth mentioning and I don't remember the prices.  The service was okay.  The third visit was for a going-away gathering for a close friend.  We drank for about three hours and my friend threw up on the bar and no one noticed, so we quietly moved to the other side of the bar.  Sadly, a bar patron walked up to the spot where my friend puked and put his hands right in it while trying to order a beer.  He was angered and disgusted and he retreated to the bathroom to clean himself up.  My friend was then hungry with his newly emptied stomach, so I bought him a burger with fries.  He said it was quite tasty, but what did he know, he was wasted.  Then I drove him home.  Anyway, I recall the drinks being pricey.    This place has one of the few mechanical bulls in Northeast Ohio and certainly the only mechanical bull in downtown Cleveland.  I think this restaurant is out of place.  It may do better in the Brunswick or somewhere.  Downtown is not the best location for this type of bar/restaurant.  I watched them build this place and to this day, there are pro-union protesters standing outside because either Cadillac Ranch doesn't use unionized labor or they didn't use unionized labor to build it.  Either way, the protesters are totally annoying.  Overall, I don't recommend Cadillac Ranch and I will not return here.  http://cadillacranchgroup.com/cleveland.html"}
{"text":"I can see why this place is getting such horrible reviews. It explicitly says \"Cocktails\" in the Star on the first page of their website, yet when I visited the establishment, they would only serve me beer. They said that making a mixed drinks slowed them down on service. Personally, not giving a patron what they want...is even poorer service!"}
