{"text":"I work closeby and was looking for something new to try for lunch. My coworker and I each ordered a salad and I ordered a side of pasta. I picked it up 10 minutes later. It was ready and hot. The service was great. The salads that were each around $8 were unimpressive at best. The portions were that of a side dinner salad. The chicken Ceasar had bland strips of boiled chicken and no cheese. The tuna salad looked like they opened a can and dumped it on top. The hard boiled eggs were just over halfway cooked and the outside of the yolks were a darker green. The pasta had Alfredo sauce and it was so oily and chunky. It was hot and tasted OK, but not great. I would have gotten more for my money and had a heartier salad from a fast food drive thru. Very disappointed. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Been going here since I was a kid and getting the same thing ever since. 
Salad is the bomb! 
Homemade angel hair is the stuff of dreams...
And you gotta take home a pizza for a midnight snack... delicious!"}
{"text":"Not much good to say about this place.  I had the fish fry -- very thin fillets with a soft battered coating.  The waitress admitted that the mashed potatoes are instant, so I opted for the home fries which were cold and tasteless.  The friend I was with had the chicken piccata, which the waitress warned was not the typical chicken piccata dish we might expect, but she thought she'd try it. It looked very strange -- more like an omelette -- and my friend said she couldn't even taste the chicken.  She was given a piece of lemon meringue pie at no cost since she didn't like her dish, but the pie was frozen so she had to take it home."}
{"text":"Been eating here for 30 years...tonight I had the red clam sauce which is outstanding! Loaded with clams over homemade pasta. By far the best I've ever eaten. Everything is always very fresh. Love this place..please move out to Mentor!"}
{"text":"My husband and I really enjoy their pizza.  The sauce/cheese/pepperoni ratio is really good, not to mention that the sauce is delicious.  We're excited to try their meatball/pasta dishes next!"}
{"text":"I recently tried the eggplant parmigiana and wasn't crazy about it...it tasted underdone. However, if you just want pizza this place makes the best pie in Wickliffe. The staff is friendly and the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Great food. Been coming here for years. Some of the best pizza in Cleveland. Casual atmosphere with great prices on beverages and food. Patio is nice in the summer for a family."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years and it is simply the best! Amazing homemade pasta and pizza and wonderful staff. Family owned :)"}
{"text":"If you like bland food...disregard this review:

We wanted good quick pizza for dinner. The great thing about Yelp is the distance tracker. This was the \"best\" rated near by pizza so we gave it a try. Going in blind, the lady on the phone recommended the white pizza. She could have cut a circle from a cardboard box, slapped some cheese on it and presented us with that. There was absolutely no flavor other then straight butter. We also ordered a pizza with red sauce and tied it's cousin on the flavor scale. I will just stick to driving into the next city to pick up pizza. The search continues for the best pie around."}
{"text":"I just had a 13'' pizza from Petti's Pizza. When I walked in at noon the place only had 2 people seated. It's a nice space, but clearly take out is popular as 2 others popped in to get lunch orders to go while I was picking up mine! I ordered a personalized broccoli, sausage, and mushroom. It was FULL of toping and piping hot. The crust is on the thin side but very filling. There is an option to get red or white sauce. I ordered the red sauce and it was very tasty! The other ingredients were fresh and the staff was nice and quick to take care of ringing me out. I would absolutely eat at this place again."}
{"text":"Prices excellent!  Food is amazing!!  I had homemade pasta with meatballs. It was awesome!  I couldn't give it 5 stars because of my assigned waitress. Not sure of her name because she didn't introduce herself. I asked her to tell me about the specials and she asked me what my questions were. So I had to go back to the entrance and read all of the specials that I originally saw for 30 seconds.  She brought us our check when she served us lunch. Guess no desert for me:(. Everyone has a bad day and I will happily visit this place again. It could be that I'm used to southern hospitality. Either way, please visit this wonderful place!!"}
{"text":"I work with a 5 foot Deigo and he insists on only eating Italian food on a daily basis.  Needless to say, I have been here a bunch and gotten only take away.  Everything I have tried has been great.  They have daily specials.   Staff is always nice and today the one said she like my beard.  I see a manicotti wrestling session in her near future..."}
{"text":"The food was great but service was good for our server but felt SUPER uncomfortable because one of the servers was complaining about not getting a table to serve and gave mean looks to our table. Wasn't ecen our fault! I wantes to eat in peace! Then as we left the ladyade fun of is or felt like it was as we left but if I had her name and was the manager there I would have her fired on the spot there. Very unprofessional!"}
{"text":"I just moved to the area and was told that the pizza at Petti's was the best in town.  We called and placed a pickup order for a cheese pizza and a side of rigatoni alfredo. The pizza sauce is great, the pie itself could have been baked a little longer. The alfredo was not what I was expecting but delicious.  We will be back!!"}
