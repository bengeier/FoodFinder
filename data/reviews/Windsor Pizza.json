{"text":"Went into windsor on friday night. Waited like 15 minutes for the pizza which was great. Lots of toppings and staff was excellent to deal with. The ginger guy who helped us was on his game for sure. Felt like the pizza could've used a couple more minutes in the oven. Went for the pizza but stayed for the swivel chairs. Would've given it 3.5 stars but fuckin yelp won't let me."}
{"text":"This is a place, we went and ordered simple vegetable pizza - it was good but nothing exceptional.  Upon paying - the lady recommended to go with pizza and have garlic and olives- next time will try that and update the review."}
{"text":"I'm from Windsor. Grew up there, family is still there. I know their pizza well. This place has the crispy bottom, doughy top down. The topping are on top the cheese and diced small so every bite has some of everything. The sauce is not too thin not too much and the flavor compliments without over powering. The Windsor sauce is TBQ sauce, awesome for crust or wings. Much to my delight they serve Vernors as well, which Albertans probably don't know is the best pop! This place makes me feel so at home. The only thing missing is the pollution baked into it lol."}
{"text":"It's been almost 10 years since I've been back to Windsor ON - so it's a little difficult for my tastebuds to remember exactly what a true pie from \"Canada's Capitol of Pizza\" tastes like.   With that being said: This pizza hits the memory check marks in all the right ways! The super chewy stringy cheese dripping with grease and burning my face as I eat it. The shredded pepperoni! (as far as I'm concerned this is the cornerstone of any good pie from the homeland) The sausage that they used was even crumbled and tasted right! And the Vernors that they carry to wash it down was aces!  But there were a few drawbacks. Crust was a little underdone and REALLY puffy and doughy.  While not bad - it was a little too much crust for my liking. The sauce wasn't as zingy as I remember it from other pizzerias in Windsor. They didn't put enough sauce on the pie nor was it spread right to the edge. Toppings weren't  evenly distributed either.   The shredded pepperoni should be spread right to the edge so that EVERY bite is equally delicious! As it was the centre 3 or 4 bites were the best and the pie got less satisfying as you got toward the edge.  Overall a VERY decent representation of a Windsor pie. I would call it a very close homage to a pie from  Sam's Pizzeria and Cantina on Wyandotte, across from the UofW.  If they could get closer to the thinner crust, tangy sauce perfection of Antoninio's down on south Howard Ave, this place would be my pizzaria of choice in Calgary and I'd never go anywhere else!"}
{"text":"TL;DR: Great pizza, but they're really disorganized. So either give them some time to sort things out or bring your patience.    Stopped in a couple weeks ago and they weren't quite open. They said they were waiting on a final inspection and would be open \"next week\".  My wife and I came in at 4:30 today and it was a little bit of madness. They were busy with phone-in orders. Lots of people standing and waiting with what looked like impatient looks on their faces. Lots of confusion behind the counter with the cashier trying to take calls and payments for the outgoing orders and the manager (owner?) running around trying to keep things in some semblance of order.  After about a 10 minute wait I placed my order. They said it would be 30-45 minutes. I went home and let the dog out and came back after 35 minutes. I was told the pizza was in the oven though I didn't actually get my pizza until 5:56. A total wait time from 4:30 until 5:56.  I think what happened was there were three orders at the same time that were almost identical. While I was waiting a guy came in that said he ordered a half Hawaiian, half pepperoni and bacon but only got pepperoni and bacon. There was a very impatient guy waiting for a pepperoni and bacon and me waiting for a pepperoni and bacon. So they probably gave my pizza or the impatient guy's pizza to the Hawaiian guy. So then everything got bumped down the line.  This would explain everything except for the fact that when I got home and opened the box, I had a Hawaiian pizza. The receipt said \"Chris\" and was for a Hawaiian pizza so I'm guessing there was another Chris walking in there not long after me looking for a Hawaiian pizza. My wife and I like Hawaiian pizza though so it wasn't a total loss, it just wasn't what we ordered. The thing that gets me about this mistake was that the manager noticed I had been waiting patiently and came out to ask what I was waiting for so she could check on my order. So how I end up with the completely wrong pizza I don't understand.  After the manager came to ask about my order she came back out a few minutes later to apologize for the long wait and to get my information so she could give me a discount on my next order. I gave her my card. She also asked if I wanted a slice while I waited. A few minutes later she asked if I wanted a whole pizza to take with me as well which they had from accidentally making the same pizza twice. All of the generosity in such a situation was greatly appreciated.  Near the end of my wait I noticed at 5:43 there was suddenly no one else coming in and only a couple in the works. Clearly there's a big rush from the businesses in the area of people picking up on their way home. So even pushing off your order by 20 minutes could let you avoid the craziness I experienced.  Aside from the long wait... The interior is nice. It has the usual modern design features for this kind of place with brick walls, reclaimed wood paneling, and bare bulb dangling from a cord lighting.  There's a TV to keep you occupied while you wait and there's a limited amount of seating if you choose to eat in; approximately 8 stools and chairs.  Overall the pizza is good. Once they get things sorted out operationally I'll be back again.  TO THE MANAGER: Firstly, sorry for calling you \"the manager\", I didn't catch your name. Thank-you for your generosity and attention. I completely understand that things were busier than expected in your first week of operations. I'll be back to take you up on your discount offer. Keep up the good work."}
